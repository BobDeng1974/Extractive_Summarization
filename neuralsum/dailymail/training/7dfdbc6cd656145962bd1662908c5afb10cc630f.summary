rich people in @entity2 have better and more sleep than people with lower incomes , a study revealed rich people get more sleep than people with lower incomes , a study revealed			2
ethnic minority students , along with students from lower - income families or those living in urban areas get less sleep compared to wealthier white males , according to the @entity18 study			1
researchers surveyed 270,000 students in @entity2 from both public and private schools between 1991 and 2012 , and asked them : how often they slept for more than seven hours a night and how often they sleep less than they should			1
the recommended amount of sleep for adolescents is nine hours , however students from lower - income families and ethnic minorities did not report having more than seven hours of sleep a night			1
this could be due to housing quality , obesity and conditions that disrupt sleep , according to researchers surprisingly , while these students received less than the recommended amount , they reported they felt they had received enough rest			1
girls reported having less hours of sleep compared to boys			1
factors that are potentially contributing to the decline of recommended sleep includes the increase use of the @entity47 and social media , and demands of school and extracurricular activities ( above file photo ) stick to the same bedtime : sleep experts believe going to bed and waking up at the same times on a regular basis is vital for healthy sleep			1
this is because humans have an inbuilt body clock called the circadian rhythm			0
controlled by hypothalamus at the base of the brain , it governs the body 's daily alternation between sleep and wakefulness			0
take a hot bath : taking a hot bath before bed can help induce sleep , says @entity74 , author of a new book called @entity76			0
this is because your body temperature has a strong influence on how fast you fall asleep			0
a night 's sleep is normally proceeded by a slight drop in body temperature and scientists have established that this drop in temperature tells your body to go to sleep			0
the theory behind taking a hot bath is to raise your body temperature artificially before allowing it to drop again as it adjusts to the cooler environment of your room			0
the trick , says @entity74 , is to take a bath one to two hours before bedtime and keep your bath temperature warm , rather than hot			0
treat yourself to a hot , milky drink : it may sound like an old wives ' tale but taking a hot milky drink can encourage drowsiness because milk contains sleep - enhancing properties			2
this is thanks to its calcium content , which sleep experts claim can help you relax			0
it is also rich in tryptophan , which the body converts into serotonin - a natural hormone in the body that can make you sleepy			0
this compares to coffee - which is twice as stimulating as tea due to its high caffeine content			2
sleep experts recommend drinking coffee no later than within two to three hours of going to bed , so that your body has a chance to process the caffeine			0
this disparity could mean those from lower - income families and ethnic minorities have not received enough education on the importance of sleep when it comes to health			1
students from middle and higher - income families who had parents that received a high school education regularly reported having more than seven hours of sleep			1
the study also found that girls had less hours of sleep a night compared to boys			2
the recommended amount of sleep for adolescents is nine hours , however students from lower - income families and ethnic minorities did not report having more than seven hours of sleep a night			1
over the years , 15 - year - old children had the biggest drop in sleep as it dropped nine per cent from 1991 and 2012 ( above a graph of the amount of sleep adolescents receive by age group ) over the years , 15 - year - old children had the biggest drop in sleep as it decreased a total of nine per cent - from 71.5 per cent in 1991 to 63 per cent in 2012			2
and generally , there has been a decline in adolescents who are not getting enough sleep , one - third , which could be a public health concern			0
factors that are potentially contributing to the decline of recommended sleep includes the increase use of the @entity47 and social media , and demands of school and extracurricular activities .			1
