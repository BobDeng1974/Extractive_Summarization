the ability of chimpanzees to communicate and use tools has fascinated scientists for years			2
and now they have witnessed how new behaviour is adopted and transmitted from individual to individual within a wild chimpanzee colony			1
it is the first time that experts have caught this behaviour on camera in real - time and they say that the footage will shed light on how culture spread among early humans			1
this image shows @entity23 of the @entity25 chimpanzee community of the @entity26 in @entity27 , using a moss - sponge - a behavior she learned by observing her mother the team studied the spread of two novel tool - uses among the @entity25 chimpanzee community living in @entity27 's @entity26			1
' researchers have been fascinated for decades by the differences in behaviour between chimpanzee communities ; some use tools some do n't , some use different tools for the same job , ' said dr @entity44 of the @entity45 in @entity46			1
' these behavioural variations have been described as " cultural " , which , in human terms would mean they spread when one individual learns from another ; but in most cases they 're long established and it 's hard to know how they originally spread within a group			2
' we were incredibly lucky to be in the right place at the right time to document the appearance and spread of two novel tool - use behaviours , something that is extraordinarily rare in the wild			1
' the results of the real - time discovery , described as ' extraordinarily rare ' , are published in the latest edition of the journal @entity68			1
the analysis began when @entity70 , the 29 - year - old alpha male chimpanzee , made a moss sponge while being watched by @entity72 , a dominant adult female			2
over the next six days a further seven individuals made and used moss sponges			0
six of these had observed the behaviour before adopting it and the seventh was seen to re-use a discarded moss sponge so may have learned about the novel behaviour in this way			0
the scientists also recorded a 12 - year - old sub-adult male retrieve and use a discarded leaf sponge			2
a further eight individuals adopted the re-use technique , but only four of them observed another individual re-using a sponge first			0
by using a technique called network - based diffusion analysis the researchers estimated that each time a ' naïve ' chimpanzee observed moss - sponging , this individual was 15 times more likely to develop the behaviour			1
this striking effect contrasted with the re-use behaviour in which social learning played much less of a role			0
the researchers investigated the spread of new variations of ' leaf - sponges ' , which are tools dipped in water to drink from , commonly manufactured by the @entity109 chimpanzees by folding leaves in their mouth			1
different individuals were observed to develop two novel variants : moss - sponging ( a sponge made of moss or a mixture of leaves and moss ) and leaf - sponge re-use ( using a sponge left behind on a previous visit )			0
neither moss - sponging nor leaf - sponge re-use had been previously observed in @entity124 in over twenty years of continuous observation			0
chimpanzees are widely considered to be the most ' cultural ' of all non-human animals , but most studies examining how behaviour is transmitted are carried out in captive groups			2
this has long been a focus for critics of arguments for chimpanzee culture , who point out that without similar evidence from the wild it is difficult to argue for an evolutionary connection between human and chimpanzee ' culture '			0
but now , the researchers from the @entity45 , @entity146 , @entity147 , and @entity150 du @entity148 , have proved how a new natural behaviour was passed from individual to individual in a wild community			1
the researchers investigated the spread of new variations of ' leaf - sponges ' , which are tools dipped in water to drink from , commonly manufactured by the @entity109 chimpanzees by folding leaves in their mouth ( pictured ) dr @entity160 , senior lecturer in zoology at @entity147 said : ' our results provide strong evidence for social transmission along the chimpanzees ' social network , demonstrating that wild chimpanzees learn novel tool - use from each other and support the claim that some of the observed behavioural diversity in wild chimpanzees should be interpreted as ' cultural '			1
' dr @entity176 , @entity177 at the @entity146 , said : ' this study tells us that chimpanzee culture changes over time , little by little , by building on previous knowledge found within the community			2
' this is probably how our early ancestors ' cultures also changed over time			1
' in this respect , this is a great example of how studying chimpanzee culture can help us model the evolution of human culture			0
' nevertheless , something must have subsequently happened in our evolution that caused a qualitative shift in what we could transmit , rendering our culture much more complex than anything found in wild apes			0
' understanding this qualitative jump in our evolutionary history is what we need to investigate now			0
' chimpanzees are widely considered to be the most ' cultural ' of all non-human animals , but most studies examining how behaviour is transmitted are carried out in captive groups			0
this is the first time that learning has been filmed in real - time in the wild			1
a still from the footage is pictured			0

it 's the first time that scientists have witnessed in real - time new behaviour being adopted and transmitted in a wild chimpanzee colony
they witnessed the spread of two novel feeding methods among the @entity25 chimpanzee community living in @entity27 's @entity26
researchers say process is how our early ancestors ' cultures changed over time and could shed light on how behaviours and tools developed
