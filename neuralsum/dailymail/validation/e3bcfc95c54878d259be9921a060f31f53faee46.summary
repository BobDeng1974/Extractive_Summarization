@entity1 ' chances of lifting the @entity3 trophy could hinge on the fitness battle being waged by @entity6 captain @entity5			1
@entity8 ’s men need a thumping victory over the @entity10 on saturday to have a chance of overhauling @entity12 and @entity13 , who both boast superior points differences			1
but @entity18 hopes took a knock with news that @entity5 , who limped off against @entity21 on sunday , has been cleared of any serious damage to his right foot following an mri scan in the @entity10 capital and hopes to recover for thursday ’s team announcement			1
@entity5 revealed on @entity27 that the soft - tissue injury is ‘ less severe than expected ’ and he could still feature alongside prop @entity29 , who is understood to have been recalled to the squad after suffering a serious dog bite on his nose three weeks ago			1
today he tweeted an image of his foot in an ice bath in a bid to get fit for the clash			1
@entity5 limped off during @entity6 's defeat by @entity21 in @entity39 at the weekend if @entity5 plays he will be a major factor in @entity1 ' attempts to win the @entity3 @entity6 v @entity21 - extended highlights the veteran @entity45 pair have 221 tests between them and their experience could be a major obstacle to @entity18 ambitions of securing the necessary landslide victory at the @entity52			1
@entity1 kept themselves in contention for the title with a classic defensive display against @entity13 on saturday but , with the race likely to be decided by points difference , focus must now shift towards attack			1
if the trophy is going to head back to @entity62 , then @entity8 ’s side must burst open the floodgates of the @entity64 and better the scoring record of both @entity12 and @entity13			1
having topped the tackle count at the @entity68 with — according to the @entity18 camp — a record - breaking 38 hits , @entity66 is hoping to keep his place in the second row			2
his side are up first in a triple - bill of fixtures and , with kick - offs staggered throughout the day , the 32 - year - old has already decided how to kill the time as other results unfold			2
@entity1 beat @entity13 23 - 16 at the @entity68 to force themselves into title contention @entity8 knows his team need a large victory to overhaul @entity12 and @entity13 ‘ we ’ll have to find some good @entity10 wine , ’ joked @entity66			1
‘ first , you have to try to win the game			2
if you look any further than winning the game by a point then you become unstuck			0
‘ that has happened in the past and as soon as you do that , you are disrespecting the opposition			0
if we can win , it gives us a chance			2
‘ we saw just how good a team they are when they won in @entity96			0
i know a few of the boys so it will be a really tough game			0
’ in an ideal scenario , @entity8 would have had the option to keep the same starting xv that beat @entity13			1
but the @entity104 will be without tight - head prop @entity105 , who was sent to @entity106 yesterday to seek specialist advice on a potentially @entity110 - threatening @entity109 injury			0
the front - row problems have been compounded by doubts over @entity113 and @entity114 — prompting call - ups for @entity118 ’s @entity117 and @entity119 ’ @entity115 , but not @entity120			0
@entity8 's @entity1 side have a +12 points difference , 25 behind @entity12 and 21 adrift of @entity13 @entity124 and @entity125 share a joke during a @entity1 training session the 34 - year - old @entity128 has hinted that he could be drawn out of retirement , however @entity18 forwards coach @entity130 insists the onus is on the player to reverse his decision			1
‘ we would be open to a call from him , ’ said @entity130			0
‘ it was his decision to hang up his boots on the international front			0
i still have his number , but there ’s no need to call him at the moment			0
as far as i ’m concerned , he ’s announced his retirement and , until he changes his mind , at the moment we have enough strength in depth			0
’ @entity130 moved to allay concerns over @entity150 after the 28 - year - old was brought off with a head injury against @entity13			1
the @entity154 centre has been a mainstay throughout the competition but , in @entity157 , @entity1 have attack - minded cover that could exploit @entity10 weaknesses in the final quarter			1
‘ we have seen so far that up until the 60 - minute mark @entity45 have been in the game and competing , ’ said @entity130			2
‘ they will be hugely disappointed with their performance against @entity21 and i am sure they will be looking to finish on a high , so that makes them more dangerous			2
we are dealing with a wounded animal			0
‘ saturday was a hugely physical test and some of the players ’ reactions following that match reflected the intensity			0
‘ the fact they have come out of that match on top makes the bruises feel that little less painful			0
the spirit is good and , by still being in the hunt for the title , everyone has come in with an appetite and an edge to build on the momentum			0

@entity5 could be fit for @entity45 's clash with @entity1 in @entity39
wales need a big win to overhaul @entity12 and @entity13
@entity5 limped off against @entity21 , but has been cleared of serious damage
