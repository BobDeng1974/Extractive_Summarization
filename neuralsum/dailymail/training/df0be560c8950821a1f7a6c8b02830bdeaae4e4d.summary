@entity0 narrowly failed to record the @entity2 's first round of 59 as he made a blistering start at the @entity5 masters			1
the @entity6 almost earned a place in history as a long - range putt on the 18th green at @entity11 in @entity12 shaved the edge of the hole			1
that meant @entity0 , who hit a @entity2 record 447 - yard drive last month , had to settle for a first - round 60 but it was still nevertheless a superb opening that put him in charge on 11 under			1
@entity0 almost earned a place in history as a long - range putt on the 18th green @entity0 completed his round shortly before the day 's play was abandoned when a torrential downpour flooded parts of the course			1
his closest challengers were @entity29 's @entity28 and @entity31 @entity30 , who both signed for eight - under - par 63s			1
@entity34 's @entity33 was seven under after 14 holes when play was washed out , meaning he could yet get close to @entity0 ' mark when play resumes on friday			2
fellow @entity40 @entity39 was in the clubhouse on seven under after a 64			0
@entity28 posted his mark early with a nine - birdie round but the day belonged to @entity0 , who hit the ground running as he set off in pursuit of the @entity46			1
he birdied the first , fourth and fifth and then sank four more birdies in succession around the turn			0
the fabled 59 , never achieved in 42 years of the @entity2 , then became a possibility as he drove the green at the par - four 15th and holed for eagle			1
a second eagle at the 17th left him needing to pick up one more stroke at the last , but his 18 - foot birdie putt there stopped , agonisingly , millimetres left of the hole			1
he tapped in for par and gestured to a camera with thumb and forefinger as he walked away , indicating how close he had come			0
' still cant believe that putt on 18 didnt drop for magical 59 Â£ personalbest , ' @entity0 later tweeted			2
he told the @entity2 's website : ' when i made eagle on 15 , i knew then that if i birdied the last three , that would have been 59			2
' @entity67 escapes a water hazard during the first day of the @entity69 discussing the crucial putt , @entity0 added : ' i thought it was going to be slightly left to right at the end and it kind of went straight and basically just left it hanging			2
too bad , i thought it was a pretty good effort , especially with these dark clouds that we saw at the back			0
it 's a great setting			0
' @entity28 caught the eye in the morning , with the one blemish on his round coming at the 17th , his eighth , where he found water and took a bogey six			2
@entity28 said on @entity87 : ' it was fantastic			0
i got off to a great start , five under through seven holes on the back nine			0
i fancied my chances of getting on 17 in two but went in the water			0
' but i tried to stay patient			0
i knew i was playing well and i was able to finish off with two birdies			0
' @entity96 's @entity95 lines up his putt on the seventh green at the @entity11 @entity100 course in @entity12 there were no bogeys on @entity30 's card , the @entity31 setting up his excellent round with five birdies on the front nine			2
defending champion @entity106 was among four players to shoot 65 , along with fellow @entity96 @entity108 , @entity110 's @entity109 and @entity29 's @entity111 , who maintained his form after taking fifth at the @entity113			0
@entity114 , the fairytale winner in @entity29 last week , had a less successful day , shooting a one - over - par 72			1
@entity116 , @entity118 's victorious @entity117 captain , continued to play on adrenaline and ended the first round in a tie for 18th after a tidy four - under - par 67 @entity28 of @entity29 shelters from the rain under an umbrella after hitting his first tee shot			1

@entity0 ' birdie putt on the 18th shaved edge of the hole
the @entity6 hit a @entity2 record 447 - yard drive last month
@entity28 and @entity30 both signed for eight - under - par 63
