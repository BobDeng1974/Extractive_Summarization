by @entity0 follow @ @ kie1410 @entity1 was nowhere to be seen and new signing @entity2 lasted just 33 minutes on his debut as @entity5 were held to a 0 - 0 draw by @entity8 outfit @entity7			1
@entity9 escaped the axe in the summer with promises to produce ' more entertaining ' football , but a goalless draw does little to reassure @entity5 owner , @entity14 , who was in attendance at @entity16			1
afterwards , though , @entity17 striker @entity2 tweeted about his pelvis after worrying his new fans : ' happy to have played my first match with the team			1
positive match for me , i 'm glad my pubis is well			1
in his absence , though , @entity5 dominated the opening exchanges with a strong starting xi. and @entity80 was at the heart of the lot			2
the winger first fed @entity81 to create a chance on the turn , before @entity80 's inch - perfect cross found @entity77 , whose header sailed over			0
the 28 - year - old , then , had a go himself , stretching to fashion a chance but missing the target			0
it was encouraging , and new boy @entity117 almost haunted his former employers on his return			0
the 24 - year - old left goalkeeper @entity120 for dead with a deft job , but only saw it crash off the face of the crossbar on his old stomping ground			0
at half time , the expected changes were made			0
among them was new signing @entity87 , who said he was ' glad to get another 45 minutes on the pitch '			1
there was also @entity2 , replacing @entity81 , but the striker 's debut was short lived to say the least			2
the @entity17 forward from @entity27 lasted a little more than half an hour before going off			0
@entity5 tried to make the breakthrough in the second half but looked deflated , unable to crack @entity7 's code			2
nevertheless , there were signs of encouragement from @entity140 overall			0
the 1,920 traveling fans will return to the capital pondering whether @entity9 can deliver the ' philosophy ' the board are asking for , and wondering why @entity1 was not included at all			1
contest : @entity7 's @entity55 protects the ball from @entity74 on wednesday pleased : @entity7 manager @entity147 oversaw his team from the touchline against @entity5 @entity5 joint - chairmen @entity14 and @entity99 said : ' we have a very clear vision of how we want @entity5 to operate under our joint ownership			1
although not everybody understands the @entity155 , we do and we respect it as we have been supporters all our lives			0
we believe this is about a philosophy that is not just about the style of play , but the whole ethos that surrounds the club			0
' @entity9 was asked to give us a detailed presentation on his vision for next season and during this he assured us that he can deliver that ethos to @entity5 and we have agreed to support him with the resources that he needs			1
we have mapped out a way forward with him that will ensure our much - deserving fans have more to cheer about next season			0
' we should also stress , though , that while improvements do need to be made , @entity9 deserves credit for the job he has done thus far after securing promotion in his first year and two respectable @entity36 finishes in the two years thereafter			2
' we have also seen the likes of @entity32 , @entity75 and @entity84 all make huge progress under his management , which in turn contributed to our impressive record of 14 clean sheets last season			0
' the truly historic opportunity of a move to the @entity183 in 2016 forms a major part of our five - year strategy to take this club forward and , while we have a duty to make sure we stay in the @entity36 , we also want to make sure the performances on the pitch will befit a team playing in such a world - renowned stadium			1
' we are absolutely committed to taking @entity5 to new heights and we want to see the club continue on an upward trajectory next season			2
the 2014 - 15 campaign is crucial to our future and we are confident that @entity9 has the passion , experience and determination to make sure it is a success			2
