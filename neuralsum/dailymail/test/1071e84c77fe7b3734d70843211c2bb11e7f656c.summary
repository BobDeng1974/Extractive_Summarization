@entity122 's syndrome is a rare congenital skin disease - a more extreme form of ichthyosis			1
sufferers ' skin appears red and scaly and can also experience hair , infection and allergy problems			1
because red skin can be attributed to several diseases , the condition may not be accurately diagnosed until later in a child 's life			1

their skin quickly loses heat , water and protein and babies are often kept in incubators on special care baby units as a result			2

as they get older , a child 's skin may remain red and scaly , and their skin may be itchy , sensitive or raw , sometimes appearing thicker at the joints			1
the condition appears out of the blue where there has been no family history			2
but , it is thought to be genetic , and parents can carry the faulty gene responsible			0
