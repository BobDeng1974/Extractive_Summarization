a new collaborative robot can work alongside human factory workers helpful robots are typically shown as mechanical maids or humanoid teachers in sci - fi films			1
but now there ’s a new collaborative robot that can work alongside human factory workers to give them a helping hand			2
the @entity10 claims to be the first ' heavy - lifting industrial collaborative robot ' to work with humans without the need for safety fences			1
the @entity16 - based company @entity15 's robot uses integrated vision technology called @entity19 to keep an eye on humans and automatically stops if it touches an operator			1
this removes the need for safety fences - a previous requirement for all industrial robots - and is said to increase efficiency and enable a higher level of automation , the firm claims			1
the robot can lift objects weighing up to 77 lbs ( 35kg ) and could be used in a number of industries , from warehouses to production lines			1
for example , it could move heavy objects or assemble parts within a shared workspace without safety fences			1
‘ collaborative robot technology opens up a new era for manufacturing in which humans and robots will work even more closely on tasks ; increasing productivity and efficiencies across the plant floor , ’ said @entity43 , vice president of fanuc			1
the machine is covered in a green soft plastic cover , which is designed to protect humans and stop them being ‘ pinched ’ in the event they are touched by the robotic arm			2
of course , robots have been used on production lines for decades			0
in the car industry for instance , many are automated so robots perform the bulk of dangerous tasks , such as welding , away from humans			2
@entity66 has already introduced robots to it vast warehouses to work along human employees			0
the @entity10 claims to be the first ' heavy - lifting industrial collaborative robot ' to work with human employees without the need for safety fences			1
images of plans are shown above robots have been used on production lines for decades			0
in the car industry for instance , many are automated so that robots perform the bulk of dangerous tasks , such as welding ( pictured ) , away from humans some 15,000 robots pick up items ordered by customers in warehouses to save humans walking miles			1
the robot can lift up to 77 lbs ( 35kg )			1
it 's designed to work alongside humans without the need for safety fences			1
the robot stops what it 's doing if it touches a human			1
this is down to integrated vision which lets it ' see ' human employees			0
it has a protective green covering so it does n't ' pinch ' workers			0
it 's designed to be as reliable as other robots on production lines and could be used in warehouses to lift heavy objects , for example			1
‘ we pick two to three times faster than we used to , ’ 34 - year - old @entity66 worker @entity109 said during a short break from sorting merchandise into bins at @entity66 's massive distribution centre in @entity114 , @entity115 , about 60 miles east of @entity116			0
‘ it 's made the job a lot easier			0
’ the squat orange robots use technology acquired when the company bought robot - maker @entity125 in 2012 , according to @entity127 , @entity66 's senior vice president for operations			1
the @entity114 centre has 1.2 million square feet of space - the equivalent of 28 football fields – which are tended by 1,500 full - time employees and 3,000 @entity125 robots , gliding swiftly and quietly around the warehouse			0
the robots navigate by scanning coded stickers on the floor , following digital commands that are beamed wirelessly from a central computer			0
@entity15 's robot can lift objects weighing up to 77 lbs ( 35kg ) and could be used in a number of industries , from warehouses to production lines			1
this illustration shows it lifting a wheel into a car ( left ) and it moving a piece to a machine ( pictured right ) each of the orange machines can slide under and then lift a stack of shelves that 's four feet ( 1.2 metres ) wide and holds up to 750 lbs ( 340kg ) of merchandise			2
the system uses bar codes to track which items are on each shelf , so a robot can fetch the right shelves for each worker as orders come in			2
workers are needed for more complex tasks such as shelving , packing and checking for damaged items and the robots adjust to their speed			0
@entity66 has already introduced robots to it vast warehouses to work along human employees			0
a @entity125 robot is shown moving goods ( left ) and another robot unloading them ( right ) , which is placed in a safety cage @entity66 has launched a competition encouraging engineers to create its next generation of shelf - picking robots			2
bots will battle it out at the @entity187 conference in @entity188 in may			0
' the challenge combines object recognition , pose recognition , grasp planning , compliant manipulation , motion planning , task planning , task execution , and error detection and recovery , ' @entity66 said			0
participating robots will earn points by locating products on shelves , retrieving them and putting them into cardboard boxes ready to be sent to customers			0
points will be deducted for dropped or damaged good and the team that creates the winning robot will win $ 26,000 ( £ 17,463 )			0
@entity66 currently uses robots by @entity125 to fetch items so its human workforces does n’t have to walk as far in its vast warehouses			2
but its machines ca n't pick and pack products yet .			0

the robot @entity10 was engineered by a company in @entity16
it is designed to be used alongside humans without safety fences
uses vision technology to look for humans and stops if it touches them
could be used in warehouses to lift heavy items up to 77 lbs ( 35kg )
