@entity0 is set to launch its own smartwatch in april to take on the @entity2			1
the move will see the two firms go head to head in a battle for the lucrative market			2
@entity0 boasts its watch wo n't need recharging - while @entity2 says its will have to be recharged every night			1
' the rewards are potentially huge for whoever comes up with a winning formula			2
@entity19 , chief analyst at @entity21 , sees the retail value of wearable internet - connected devices at $ 93.1 billion by 2018 , versus $ 4.1 billion in 2014 , with smartwatches accounting for about two thirds of the market 's value in 2018			1
however , @entity0 has not yet revealed the full capabilities of its watch			1
it says it sees the sees the advent of the $ 93billion smartwatches as an opportunity rather than a threat - and warned the tech giants they may face problems			0
the @entity0 device will communicate via a form of technology known as @entity40 , according to @entity41 , and wo nâ€™t have to be charged , chief executive officer @entity36 said in an interview			1
the @entity0 smartwatch will also let consumers make mobile payments and work with @entity46 and @entity48 software , he said			1
the market for such timepieces , which enable phone or data communication , will probably reach about $ 10 billion in 2018 , @entity50 analysts forecast last year , with half of the market coming from traditional watch wearers switching to the devices			1
@entity2 's @entity59 also confirmed the firm 's plan for @entity2 were on track			1
' development for @entity2 watch is right on schedule , and we intend to begin shipping in april , ' he said			1
' we ca n't wait for customers to experience it			0
my expectations are very high , i use it every day , love it and ca n't live without it			0
' @entity2 's watch goes on sale in april , @entity59 recently confirmed			1
@entity0 chief executive @entity36 said these new watches might allow the wearer to count the number of steps they take and calories they burn			1
and there will be a few other cool ' @entity86 ' things on offer via latest bluetooth technology , he said in an interview at the company 's headquarters in @entity92			0
' all the big technology firms want to work with us and i do n't rule out that we are or could be collaborating in some areas			0
but we can also do many things on our own			0
' @entity0 chief executive @entity36 said these new watches might allow the wearer to count the number of steps they take and calories they burn			2
wearable gadgets , such as smartwatches that allow users to connect to their phone to check emails , make calls or monitor their health , are expected to be the next big thing in the tech world and a potential threat to traditional wristwatch sales			0
' for @entity0 , this could mean a 2 percent hit to revenue and earnings before interest and tax for each 10 percent share that the @entity123 was able to gain in its addressable market , ' @entity116 analyst @entity115 said in a study in july			0
other tech companies are working on smartwatches			0
@entity13 's @entity128 is set to launch a @entity129 next week in the @entity130			2
but the spotlight is on @entity2 after the company poached executives from the fashion , luxury and medtech ( medical ) industries and registered the trademark ' @entity123 ' in @entity139			1
for many analysts , @entity0 and @entity2 would be the dream team for a smartwatch project , but @entity0 has always played down its interest in such a relationship			1
the argument is that @entity0 's business is selling watches not technology			2
' our first message for customers is the watch			2
' if they like it , they might also be interested in the extra functions , ' @entity36 said			0
' it is a problem if you only define a product by its technology			0
' technology alone does n't sell , not in watches			2
' his comments highlight the importance of fashion and branding for the development of the smartwatch business			0
' ( technology firms ) that want to strike partnerships with us also want access to brands			0
' they want ( their products ) to be more than a commodity , ' the ceo said .			0
