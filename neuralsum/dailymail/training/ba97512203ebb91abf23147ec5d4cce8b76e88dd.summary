@entity1 's @entity0 reflects on @entity3 's 3 - 1 victory over @entity4 at @entity5 on tuesday			1
@entity6 opened the scoring for @entity9 's side before captain @entity10 struck twice in the second half to seal victory over their closest rivals			2
@entity3 beat @entity4 3 - 1 at @entity5 in an international friendly on tuesday the pass from @entity17 for the opening goal was as good a long pass as you will see			1
that ’s what happens when you give somebody like him time on the ball			0
it was a beautiful pass and matched by a wonderful finish			0
@entity17 floated it effortlessly , and the flight of the ball made it almost impossible to defend			2
it was a fantastic piece of play			0
@entity17 provided a superb assist for @entity6 's first - half goal @entity17 picked out his @entity36 team - mate with a long - range pass for @entity38 to glance home @entity17 produced a laser pass which was nodded in by @entity6			1
it was a goal made at @entity36 it 's good to see @entity3 have got two excellent young talents at right back			1
@entity44 has settled quickly with @entity3			2
he was tested by @entity45 but he handled him well			0
he is assured on the ball , takes up good positions and he ’s not afraid to go forward			0
@entity48 did n’t play but he is another option , though i think his long - term future lies in defensive midfield			1
@entity3 right back @entity44 executes a sliding challenge on @entity4 's @entity54 the thing i like about this @entity3 team is the pace running through it			1
at the @entity59 we were so reliant on @entity60 to get us moving but now there is a threat from all over the park			0
@entity64 and @entity6 are so quick up front and both full backs were good going forward against @entity4			1
it used to be that without @entity60 we would not be much of a threat , but that could n’t be further from the truth on tuesday			0
the only thing i would have liked to see is @entity73 get more of a game			0
@entity64 was a constant threat to the @entity4 back line with his pace			2
