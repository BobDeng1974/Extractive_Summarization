by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 10:39 est , 12 march 2014 updated : 18:44 est , 12 march 2014 clutching a handful of notes , the @entity4 looked delighted after she won a bet against her son at @entity9 yesterday			2
after watching the race intently through binoculars , @entity10 broke into a huge grin as 6 - 4 favourite @entity14 romped to a four - and - a - half length victory			2
@entity16 seemed thrilled as she took three £ 20 notes from @entity18 , who joined her in the @entity19 , before stuffing them in her handbag			1
place your bets : @entity10 delves for money in her purse and pulled out a £ 20 note thumbs up : @entity16 appeared to be winning @entity10 later presented the trophy to @entity28 who won the @entity30 swap : @entity16 was delighted to accept a scarf from @entity28 after presenting his trophy but her chef son , 39 , appeared to be a little peeved to have lost out on the wager			2
a palace aide said : ‘ @entity16 was delighted with her win			0
she ’s a great horse lover and enjoys coming to @entity9			0
all of her family love racing			0
’ @entity16 wore a brown tweed skirt and coat by @entity42 , a £ 220 light brown , fur trimmed hat by @entity46 , and suede boots , as she attended the second day of the festival			2
her arrival at the racecourse was delayed by 20 minutes after fog meant her helicopter had to be diverted to a nearby airfield			0
she was then driven to the course where she walked through the crowds and across the parade ring to the @entity19			1
mr @entity18 wrote on @entity57 : ‘ just arrived at @entity9			1
the greatest sporting event on earth			0
’ fur and pearls : @entity16 had dressed up like a quintessential @entity63 lady camilla with her son @entity18 watching the races from the @entity19 yesterday 's races included the @entity67 , the @entity69 queen mother @entity68 and the @entity70			1
@entity10 's son joined her for a day watching some of the country 's best @entity73 jockeys			2
@entity16 , a keen horse enthusiast , was invited to the races by the chairman of @entity78 , @entity77 , and later will present a trophy to the winner of the @entity81			0
fur , tweed and plenty of pearls also topped the style menu for other women as @entity88 at the @entity9 in @entity89 got underway			0
royal outing : @entity10 is ushered through the race course @entity16 looked stylish and wrapped up warm in a tweed coat , suede boots and hat by @entity95 for the royal party - which included @entity97 and new mother @entity99 - brown boots seemed to be the order of the day			1
the three women all wore similar styles			0
@entity10 teamed hers with a brown tweed skirt and coat by @entity42 and a light brown , fur - trimmed hat by @entity108			0
@entity109 racegoer @entity99 was also in attendance at @entity9 for the second day of the festival , along with her mother @entity97 and sister - in - law @entity113			1
while other women made the most of the unseasonably warm march day to show their legs off in short dresses , the royals wrapped in long coats and boots			1
new mother @entity99 wore a purple tweed coat , furry stole and mauve hat , while @entity97 wore a long cream coat and striped velvet hat			1
ready for the races : princess royal , @entity99 and @entity113 ( in background ) arrive at @entity130 demure : the royals wrapped up in long coats and hats girls ' day out : @entity99 was joined by her sister - in - law @entity113 who are you backing ? mother and daughter discuss the runners and riders lost a bet ? @entity113 appears to have picked the wrong horse from her reaction to this race @entity99 was also at the races yesterday along with husband @entity146 as the new parents took time off from caring for their two - month - old daughter @entity148			1
yesterday , when once spectator congratulated mr @entity146 on the birth of their daughter , she quickly turned round and quipped : ' why ? he did n't even do anything ! ' perhaps he is trying to rectify this by staying home babysitting today			0
meanwhile , @entity99 must have been missing her little girl as she passed at one point to admire another baby in a buggy in the vip area			1
@entity162 : the new mother paused to admire another baby in their pram has the princess spotted @entity10 arriving by helicopter ? royal outing : @entity10 is ushered through the race course @entity16 looked stylish and wrapped up warm in a tweed coat , suede boots and hat by @entity95 @entity113 wore a navy coat and matching hat with tan boots the mother - of - two did n't appear to enjoy the day quite as much as her relatives stylish : @entity99 pulled her shades on when the sun came out yesterday : @entity99 was joined by husband @entity146 but he seemed to be on babysitting duties today while @entity182 is famous for its scantily clad racegoers and @entity184 for its hats , the @entity9 has become synonymous with an altogether more rural approach to dressing			1
eschewing skyscraper heels and flimsy dresses in favour of elegant wool coats and comfortable patent leather boots , the race meeting offers a masterclass in country chic , complete with lashings of tweed and even a flat cap or two			1
hat and heels : these women brighten up @entity88 country chic : furs , feathers and tweed were popular apparel unlike @entity184 , organisers at @entity9 refuse to impose a dress code on guests and , beyond exhortations to wrap up warm and avoid anything that might offend , say anything goes - up to and including fancy dress			1
but perhaps a warning is n't required : although the clothes donned by @entity89 's most fashionable might be rural , the looks on show certainly do n't lack glamour with oversized sunglasses , pearl necklaces and twinkling diamond stud earrings employed to up the fashion ante			0
fur too is a recurring motif , as are hats that take inspiration from rural life			0
like the stylish effort deployed by @entity99 on day one , many come festooned in pheasant feathers while elegant blooms are a perennial favourite			2
male racegoers are n't immune from the pull of country style either , with most opting for tweed suits or chic red chinos teamed with a preppy navy blazer and artfully knotted tie			0
but whether girls in pearls and princess coats or preppy chaps in @entity244 check , the @entity9 is just as stylish as its @entity246 counterpart			0

*duchess* of @entity250 was accompanied by her son @entity251 - @entity18
the pair watched the action from the @entity19
@entity99 , @entity97 and @entity113 watched *separately*
all the royal women wrapped up in long coats and knee - high boots
