scientists may have hit upon a new way of extending the lifespan of living organisms - by activating a gene that destroys unhealthy cells			1
researchers at the @entity7 found they were able to help flies live up to 60 % longer by increasing the activity of a gene that targets damaged cells			1
if this could be transferred to humans , it could extend the average lifespan of people in developed countries like the @entity18 and the @entity19 to beyond 120 years old			1
the scientists found that a gene called ahuizotl , or ' azot ' acts like a sort of cellular quality control , helping to weed out unhealthy or malfunctioning cells			1
fruit flies , like the one pictured , were given an extra copy of this gene that targets unhealthy cells			1
during tests the flies lived 60 % longer lives the scientists found that a gene called ahuizotl , or ' azot ' acts like a sort of cellular quality control , helping to weed out unhealthy or malfunctioning cells			1
it is thought to help protect crucial organs like the brain or the gut from a build up of potentially harmful unhealthy cells			2
archaeologists found bottles beneath a hotel construction site in @entity45 that once contained medicinal remedies including one called the ' @entity47 '			0
the bottle included a list of ingredients and a method for making the remedy			0
ingredients aloes - 0.46 ounces ( 13 grams ) rhubarb - 0.08 ounces ( 2.3 grams ) @entity55 - 0.08 ounces ( 2.3 grams ) @entity56 ( also known as white turmeric ) - 0.08 ounces ( 2.3 grams ) @entity59 saffron - 0.08 ounces ( 2.3 grams ) water - four fluid ounces ( 114 millilitres ) grain alcohol ( vodka , gin ) - 12 fluid ounces ( 240 millilitres ) method squeeze out the liquid from the aloes			0
crush the rhubarb , gentian and saffron together and then mix them with the aloe liquid			0
then let the mixture sit for three days but shake it every so often			0
it will then need to be filtered before it can be served			0
when the scientists gave fruit flies an extra copy of this gene , they found the insects ' tissues became healthier and aged slower			1
humans are known to also have the azot gene , opening up the possibility that it could be used to create new anti-ageing treatments			1
dr @entity87 , a lecturer in cell biology at the @entity7 who took part in the study , said : ' our flies had median lifespans 50 to 60 per cent longer than normal flies			1
' for centuries , humans have been seeking ways to extend their lives			2
in the @entity100 , @entity99 was said to have lived for 969 years			2
@entity101 went on quests to search for the @entity103 , which was said to bestow powers including extended life			0
alchemists also dedicated themselves to producing the @entity107			0
some scientists have speculated that the human lifespan could be extended to up to 200 years			2
currently the oldest person in the world is @entity112 , a @entity113 woman who claims to be 127 years old , although she has apparently not got any evidence to support when she was born			0
however , this latest research is still some way from being tested in mammals			0
the scientists were able to extend the lifespan of fruit flies by genetically engineering them to have three copies of the azot gene			1
there are normally two copies of this gene in each cell			2
the gene is named after a mythological @entity130 creature that selectively targets fishing boats to protect the fish population of lakes			2
@entity134 , who led the work at the @entity136 from the @entity7 , said : ' our bodies are composed of several trillion cells and during aging those cells accumulate random errors due to stress or external insults , like uv - light from the sun. in the @entity100 , @entity99 was said to have lived for 969 years			1
while , @entity147 knights were reported as going on quests to search for the @entity103 ( seen above in this stained glass window )			0
the @entity103 was said to bestow powers including extended life ' because some cells are more affected than others , we reasoned that selecting the less affected cells and eliminating the damaged ones could be a good strategy to maintain tissue health and therefore delay aging and prolong lifespan			1
' dr @entity162 , a leading researcher on gerontology and the chief science officer of the @entity165 , which aims to use regenerative medicine to extend human lifespan , said it remained to be seen if the approach had any therapeutic applications			0
but , he added : ' the lifespan results reported here provide good reasons to explore that possibility further			0
' this study significantly advances our understanding of a mechanism of cellular quality control that detects relative , rather than absolute , cell health			0
' preserving the healthier cells in a particular tissue and culling the sicker ones irrespective of the whole tissue 's average health is a strategy that evidently works well in many circumstances , since it also exists in mammals			1

@entity191 researchers gave fruit flies an extra copy of a gene known as ' azot '
it is thought to kill cells that malfunction to help keep tissues healthy
tissue from flies with the extra gene grew slower , and was healthier
the flies also lived between 50 to 60 per cent longer than normal insects
humans also carry the azot gene and the researchers from the @entity7 hope it could be used to develop new anti-aging treatments
if it has the same affect in humans , the average lifespan could become 120
