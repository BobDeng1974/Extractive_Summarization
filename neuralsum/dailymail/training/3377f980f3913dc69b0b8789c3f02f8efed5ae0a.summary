a heroic @entity1 helicopter pilot saved his family - and cheated death - by hurling his wife children onto a fleeing @entity6 warship during the @entity7 , then leaping into the sea as the aircraft plunged into the waters behind him			1
new footage has emerged showing his daring escape as the @entity14 withdrew from @entity15 in the face of advancing communist forces			2
the pilot was one of several @entity1 helicopter pilots who piled in during the @entity6 ' evacuation of all its personnel in @entity15 in april 1970			1
hovering : the pilot , seen above in the leftmost window , tailed @entity6 choppers to make it to the @entity26 , where he threw his family to safety because his @entity28 was too large to land on the deck explosion : the helicopter blew up dramatically as the pilot banked it into the sea as he leaped out after jettisoning his family catch ! servicemen below were able to grab his falling children - the youngest of whom , above , was just eight months old their story - and new photographs and footage of their dramatic escape - have been unearthed and turned into a forthcoming documentary for @entity46			1
while @entity6 servicemen flew @entity6 , and hundreds of @entity48 , between the embassy in @entity50 and ships waiting off the coast of @entity15 , some @entity1 took matters into their own hands			2
armed only with their scarcely - fueled small helicopters , many pilots tailed the @entity6 helicopters back to the waiting @entity26 , and were allowed to land on board with their families and cram onto the ship			1
desperate mission : after saving his family the pilot made his own escape , bringing his helicopter just above the water escape ! the pilot , seen right in the water , was able to swim to safety while the helicopter sank to the bottom joining in with the huge evacuation - dubbed @entity71 - was their only hope of escaping torture and death at the hands of @entity15			1
in now - iconic images , the useless choppers were then pushed overboard to make room for more evacuees			0
but the new footage , compiled by director @entity82 , also features one even more dramatic story			0
@entity84 : @entity1 choppers followed the @entity6 to boats waiting offshore - seen above as a white trail in the sea - which allowed them to land on deck refugees : ships such as the @entity26 were heaving with @entity48 escaping the encroaching communist armies one @entity1 pilot followed like his comrades - but he was flying a much larger chinook aircraft which could n't land on the @entity26			1
so instead he hovered an estimated 18ft above the deck , and hurled his children - aged two , five and eight months - out of the plane into the arms of @entity6 servicemen , followed by his wife			2
then - trapped in his helicopter and fast running out of fuel - he pulled of his pilot suit , hovered as close to the water as he could , and prepared to leap out			0
abandoned : soldiers dumped landed helicopters in the water to make room for more people on board evacuation : thousands of people were carried out of the @entity115 in @entity50 , above , by helicopters			0
it remains the largest ever helicopter evacuation the pilot tilted the right - hand side of the helicopter into the sea , while leaping out of the left hand side			0
the chopper exploded when it hit the sea , but after less than a minute the pilot 's head emerged from the water not far from the sinking wreckage and he was taken on board the @entity26			1
@entity71 - which began using fixed - wing aircraft until all the @entity6 runways were shelled and unusable - evacuated more than 50,000 from @entity1			2
the helicopter portion remains largest evacuation by helicopter in history			0
most vietnamese who escaped during the @entity7 were allowed to move to the @entity6			0
desperate : pictured above are dozens of @entity1 piling on to a small helicopter on a building not far from the @entity6 @entity115 as part of @entity71			0
