@entity0 does n’t give the impression of a man with a burning desire to abandon all the good things he has going on for a shot at solving the perennial puzzle that is @entity7			1
why should he ? @entity0 popped into @entity8 on sunday to see @entity9 beat @entity7 and witnessed the fourth home defeat for @entity12 ’s team in this @entity14 campaign and the reaction that went with it			1
if anything it must have reinforced his belief that he is in a job he adores , where he is appreciated for his efforts building the @entity21 into a world force , and where the sun shines for up to 340 days a year			1
@entity21 boss @entity0 poses in @entity24 , and had plenty to say on the @entity7 situation @entity0 believes @entity12 should be given much more time as @entity7 boss @entity7 have lost five of their opening 11 @entity14 games under @entity12 this season @entity7 chairman @entity31 will be expecting @entity12 to turn @entity7 ' fortunes around quickly ‘ i wish @entity12 only the best , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ he ’s a tremendous , talented coach			2
he ’s shown that already			0
he ’s got a smart brain			0
every coach needs time to put his mark on an environment , on a club , on a national team programme			1
wherever you work , it ’s only going to happen over time			2
‘ unfortunately , professional football is driven by short - term results and high media expectations , high fan expectations and that often drives clubs to make quick decisions because they have lost five games in a row			1
' if you want to evaluate the work of a coach then you can only do that over a longer period of time			2
for @entity12 to put his stamp on @entity7 he needs time , he probably also needs a couple of transfer windows to build the team he has in mind			1
’ @entity0 is in @entity24 to prepare the @entity21 for a friendly against @entity63 at @entity64 on friday			1
he named his squad on monday and included @entity66 , the 21 - year - old @entity67 defender who has signed for @entity7 and could have work permit issues sorted out in time to move in january , after acquiring a @entity70 passport			1
@entity0 is delighted young talent @entity66 ( right ) will be honing his skills at @entity7 @entity7 legend and current @entity21 manager @entity0 watched sunday 's clash at @entity8 ‘ we are super-excited that he is coming here , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ he is highly talented , has great pace , good character , a good kid and he wants to learn			0
@entity7 will get a huge talent , but also , similar to the coaches , a talent who needs time			1
' i want @entity66 to come here to build that special relationship with @entity7			1
for me it was a tremendous learning experience			0
’ @entity0 arrived at @entity7 in 1994 having already played at the top level in @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91			1
he stayed for one season , won @entity93 and later returned on loan to help @entity7 avoid relegation			1
he does n’t rule out an eventual return to @entity98 football , but he is committed to the @entity99 through to the end of the next @entity101 , and is relishing his role at the head of an organisation breaking new frontiers			0
he married an @entity99 , @entity106 , and has been settled in @entity107 since 1998			0
they have teenage children @entity110 and @entity111 , and @entity0 flies helicopters as a hobby			1
he is studying for a commercial licence			0
his children support the @entity99 in sports and @entity111 is a goalkeeper for the @entity21 ’s @entity118 team			2
@entity0 has performed fantastically well as @entity21 coach since joining in 2011 @entity0 had two stints at @entity7 , in 1994 - 95 and 1997 - 98 , scoring 29 @entity14 goals ‘ i never imagined when i was a player that i would become a coach , ’ said @entity0 , but the path was set when he accepted an invitation from former @entity89 manager @entity126 to organise a coaching course and , before he knew it , he was fully qualified , helping @entity131 off the ground and taking charge of his country in their own @entity101			1
‘ @entity89 called and i was like : “ what ? ” the next day , i thought : “ ok ”			0
i had two years to build something in @entity89			0
the deadline was the first game of the @entity101 and i went through a tremendous learning curve and a lot of walls			0
‘ it obviously ended up well and i was actually on my way here to the @entity14 — i ca n’t say where — when @entity145 called			1
so i got that experience and again hit walls			0
@entity99 impressed at the @entity101 , losing at the last - 16 stage to @entity150 in @entity151 ‘ you never know what happens tomorrow and in life			0
a major point is what is best for the family			0
i ’m not making any moves , even from 2018 , that do n’t consider the family			0
’ until then , the target is to build towards @entity162 2018			0
‘ we ’re still trying to catch up with the big football nations in the world , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ over the past few years , we ’ve done quite a good job and want to do the next big step			0
we set the benchmark very high			2
next time at the @entity101 we set the benchmark at the semi-final			2
many years down the road , it will definitely be the goal to win the @entity101			0
‘ we also have benchmarks like a club coach has every weekend , we have ours to get results and look good			2
it ’s not that i ’m totally safe here			0
’ far safer , however , than any manager can be at @entity7			2
