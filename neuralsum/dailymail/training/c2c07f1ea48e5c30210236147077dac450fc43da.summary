by @entity0 published : 09:03 est , 31 october 2013 updated : 10:26 est , 31 october 2013 one of the biggest quests in physics , the search for the enigmatic substance known as dark matter , has failed to provide answers			1
the @entity9 ( @entity10 ) experiment , the world ’s most advanced test to find this elusive material , yesterday completed its first 90 - day run			1
located 4,580 feet ( 1,400 metres ) beneath the ground at a former gold mine in @entity18 , @entity10 experiments have so far come back empty handed			2
the @entity9 experiment , the world 's most advanced test to find this elusive material , yesterday completed its first 90 - day run without finding any dark matter the researchers now plan to create a similar detector that is 1,000 more powerful next year			1
dark matter is thought to make up 27 per cent of the universe , but experiments have failed to confirm its presence			1
it is considered crucial to theories explaining how the universe is expanding and how galaxies interact			1
scientists are fairly sure it exists , but they do not know what it looks like or where to find it			2
the @entity10 detector is lined with white teflon to better gather faint signals of light that will be recorded by the photomultiplier tubes			2
water - 70,000 gallons of it - provides further protection from background radiation dark matter accounts for most of the mass in the @entity47 - around 27 per cent			1
it surrounds galaxies across the universe , and is invisible because it does not reflect light			2
it can not be seen directly with telescopes , but astronomers know it to be out there because of the gravitational effects it has on the matter we can see			2
galaxies , for example , could not rotate the way they do and hold their shape without the presence of dark matter , researchers say			1
the @entity69 says : ' shine a torch in a completely dark room , and you will see only what the torch illuminates			2
' that does not mean that the room around you does not exist			0
' similarly we know dark matter exists but have never observed it directly			1
' scientists are fairly sure it exists and is crucial to the universe , but they do not know what it looks like or where to find it			1
astronomers have only been able to theorise its existence through the gravitational effects it has on matter in the universe			2
one way of testing for it is to use detectors deep underground , such as @entity10 , to try and detect the moment dark matter particles pass through the @entity100			1
scientists hoped @entity10 ’s location deep underground would trap dark matter , which would be revealed through weakly interacting massive particles , dubbed @entity105			1
millions of these @entity105 are thought to be travelling through regular matter without us knowing it			2
in both theory and practice , collisions between @entity105 and normal matter are rare and extremely difficult to detect			2
this is because a constant rain of cosmic radiation from space can drown out the faint signals			0
as well as being underground , @entity10 is further protected from background radiation from the surrounding rock by immersion in a tank of ultra-pure water			0
at the heart of the experiment is a 6 - foot - tall titanium tank filled with almost a third of a tonne of liquid xenon , cooled to minus 150 degrees @entity129			0
if a wimp strikes an atom of an element named xenon , it recoils from other xenon atoms and emits light and electrons			0
the electrons are drawn upward by an electrical field and interact with a thin layer of xenon gas at the top of the tank , releasing more photons			0
@entity10 is located 4,580 feet ( 1,400 meters ) beneath the ground at a former gold mine in @entity18 photomultiplier tubes capable of detecting a single photon of light line the top and bottom of the @entity10 dark matter detector			1
they will record the position and intensity of collisions between dark matter particles and xenon nuclei light detectors in the top and bottom of the tank are each capable of detecting a single photon			1
the locations of the two photon signals – one at the collision point , the other at the top of the tank – can be pinpointed to within a few millimeters			0
the energy of the interaction can be precisely measured from the brightness of the signals			0
so far , however , that has n't happened			0
the team said that this absence also ruled out the possibility that other detectors had seen glimpses of dark matter			1
‘ this is only the beginning for @entity10 ’ , said physicist @entity181 of @entity182			0
‘ now that we understand the instrument and its backgrounds , we will continue to take data , testing for more and more elusive candidates for dark matter			1
’ planning for the next - generation dark matter experiment at the @entity191 already is under way			1
compared to @entity10 ’s third of a tonne of liquid xenon , the @entity194 , or @entity195 , experiment would have a seven tonne liquid xenon target inside the same 72,000 - gallon tank of pure water used by @entity10			0
‘ @entity195 will be a thousand times more sensitive than the @entity10 detector , ” said @entity202 , the spokesman for @entity195			0
‘ it will just begin to see an irreducible background of neutrinos that may ultimately set the limit to our ability to measure dark matter			1
’ 1 - as well as being underground , @entity10 is further protected from background radiation from the surrounding rock by immersion in a tank of ultra-pure water			0
2 - closed loop of liquid nitrogen condensation / evaporation provides 1 kw cooling power to the detector			0
3 - at the heart of the experiment is a 6 - foot - tall titanium tank filled with almost a third of a tonne of liquid xenon , cooled to minus 150 degrees @entity129			0
4 - if a wimp strikes a xenon atom it recoils from other xenon atoms and emits light and electrons			0
5 - the electrons are drawn upward by an electrical field and interact with a thin layer of xenon gas at the top of the tank , releasing more @entity239 detectors in the top and bottom of the tank are each capable of detecting a single photon 6 - the internal supporting frame is composed of two @entity246 copper holder plates and titanium straps			0
the energy of the interaction can be precisely measured from the brightness of the signals .			0

test aimed to find dark matter which is thought to make up 27 *%* of universe
dark matter is crucial to proving theories of how the universe is expanding
experiment took place at the @entity9 in @entity18
scientists now plan to run a detector that is 1,000 more powerful next year
