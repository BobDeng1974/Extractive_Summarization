for many people , becoming a parent is the most important task in life			0
for one mp , however , children are simply the ‘ opium of the masses ’			2
conservative backbencher @entity8 has hit out at people who think of their offspring as their ‘ purpose ’ in life – despite admitting he would like to become a father himself			1
he said : ‘ if we say the purpose of life is our children , that ’s neither a purpose nor a meaning			1
but i ’m sure i will be as besotted as everybody else when i have them			0
’ conservative mp @entity8 says people should not let their lives be driven or defined by having children playing on revolutionary @entity24 ’s infamous statement that ‘ religion is the opium of the masses ’ , mr @entity8 described children as the new ‘ opium ’			1
his comments come just five months after he criticised society for worshipping children as they once worshipped @entity32			2
on that occasion he also compared children to ‘ opium ’ , but focused his attack on society ’s tendency to prioritise the needs of young people over the elderly			2
it is not known what the 41 - year - old ’s wife @entity43 , 33 , will make of his comments , which he made in an interview with the @entity46			1
the pair , who have been married for almost two years , have yet to have children of their own			2
they first met when she and her first husband , an aid worker , moved to work for the @entity52 , a charity mr @entity8 set up in 2006			2
the mp made the comments in an interview with the @entity46 magazine she became its chief executive a few months later and moved in with him after ditching her husband in 2010			1
mr @entity8 , who is mp for @entity60 and the @entity61 , has made a documentary about the boundary between @entity64 and @entity65 for @entity66 , called @entity67 of @entity69 ’s @entity68			1
before entering @entity70 , he served as a soldier and a diplomat and wrote a book about his experiences walking across @entity75			0
mr @entity8 said his life is ‘ slower ’ now he is an mp , adding : ‘ being a backbench mp is a bit of an anti-climax for a superhero			1
’ and he said politicians have less power than many voters realised : ‘ the politicians think the journalists have power , the journalists think bankers have power , bankers think lawyers have power			0
the truth is , nobody has power			0
’ the mp – who is @entity64 – is campaigning against @entity64 independence and thinks @entity96 is a ‘ pernicious scar across the landscape ’			1
but he said he was unable to talk about his campaign while promoting his new documentary because it ‘ might put the @entity66 in a difficult position ’			0
he added : ‘ i think i probably began filming feeling that what the programme would discover was that there was a strong sense of @entity69 identity and that there would be no difference either side of the border			0
‘ but i found that @entity112 and @entity113 are actually strong , instinctive things , whatever the historical reasons			0
even the accent changes – just two inches across the border			0
