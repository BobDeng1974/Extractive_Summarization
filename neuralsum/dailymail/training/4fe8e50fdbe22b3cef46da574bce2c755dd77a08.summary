she may have been fired by @entity1 on week seven of @entity2 , but that has n't stopped @entity4 from pursuing her business dreams			1
the 28 - year - old solicitor , who was fired after an advertising task in @entity8 , is keen to show the world that there 's more to her and to dispel the image of a stuffy solicitor from this season 's @entity15 show			1
@entity4 , from @entity17 , says she 's determined to give the law industry a ' modern and sexier facelift ' and encourage women to embrace their beauty as well as their brains			1
' when you are new to any role you will be judged on many factors and unfortunately the first one is bound to be looks			0
i remember as a trainee solicitor , me and a couple of other female trainees being compared to @entity41			2
or the odd comments when we were introduced to the staff floor by floor , that we looked more like models on a catwalk			0
' luckily for us , our warm personalities and competency at our jobs quickly silenced these murmurs			0
it was only years later that we learnt the full extent of how we had been judged that first day			0
' if people think i am good looking then i do not think it hindered me at that time but i 'm sure it did n't help either			0
you definitely have extra pressure to be good at your job and to prove that you 're more than just a pretty face			0
' hindered : @entity4 explains that as a trainee solicitor , she and a couple of other female trainees were compared to @entity41 and it was once said that they looked more like models on a catwalk despite her strong beliefs , @entity4 says she is ' ashamed ' to admit that , in the past , she 's felt pressure to change the way she dressed in the workplace			1
she explained : ' when i first started in law i was conscious of power dressing , wearing less make - up and tying my hair back in an effort to be taken more seriously			1
' as i have got older and more experienced i have realised that if someone judged me based on anything but my ability to carry out my work then that was their problem			0
' @entity4 , who is ' delighted ' by the emails and tweets she receives from younger women who have said she inspired them to look to law or business as a career , wants to help others follow in her footsteps			1
she has been asked to speak next year by the @entity92 and wants to work to inspire young women to go into industries that are particularly male orientated without fear of being intimidated simply because of their gender			2
' i would like to see some more positive female women in business who get media attention for the right reasons , ' she said			2
on a mission : while she did n't make the final in @entity1 's boardroom , @entity4 says she has had plenty of interest in her new app and she wants it to become a household name ' attitudes to women in business need to change , women should feel confident enough to dress how they feel comfortable and embrace their femininity without worrying about being judged			1
men never worry about how they look or dress in the work place because they are confident in knowing that they will be judged purely on their work ethic , it should be the same way for women			2
' @entity4 's first port of call is promoting her new start - up , @entity122 describes her app as the ' ultimate tool for busy law firms looking to thrive in an increasingly competitive market , improve customer service , save time and money , and increase productivity '			1
while she did n't make the final in @entity1 's boardroom , @entity4 says she has had plenty of interest in her new app and she wants it to become a global firm and a household name			1
meanwhile , back in @entity1 's boardroom , after 10 weeks of tasks and a series of gruelling interviews , the two finalists going head - to - head in this year 's @entity142 final have been revealed			0
@entity146 and @entity148 @entity147 will battle it out to become @entity1 's next @entity142 during sunday 's final			0
the pair are fighting for the chance of @entity1 's Â£ 250,000 investment in their business plans .			0
