a @entity1 guide to @entity2 - in which the @entity3 becomes @entity4 and the @entity5 is turned into an @entity7 goddess - has been unearthed in an archive in the city of @entity10			1
as well as listing precise instructions for decorating the christmas tree , faithful yuletide revellers were to be ordered told to ditch @entity2 carols in favour of more ' @entity17 ' ditties extolling motherhood , harvests and nature			1
they include melodies which went : ' a mother enters into the world alone and is as tired as a stone : but a tree grows tall , aloof , and soon becomes her sheltering roof			2
' christmas the @entity1 way : @entity28 meets not one , but two , @entity30 during a @entity2 party given by the chief of the @entity33 in @entity34 in 1937 the 20 page instruction leaflet for party members was produced in november 1937 by the @entity38 organisation of the @entity40 branch of the @entity41			1
the @entity42 was formed the previous year and billed itself as the promoter of ' @entity45 germanic culture as a shining example of true @entity47			0
' it was never intended for publication but distributed to party functionaries to see that the population buckled down to the new way of doing things			0
the @entity1 guide to @entity2 starts off by telling followers that ' no festival is as @entity4 as @entity2 ' and then gives instructions about how many baubles should be placed on the tree			1
the swastika is ' firmly recommended ' to replace a fairy or an angel at the top			0
because @entity64 viewed organised religion as a competitor - and therefore an enemy - of the movement , its disciples were told that it was n't really a @entity70 celebration at all			0
evil at work : @entity28 sits with other @entity41 officials at a @entity2 party for @entity75 officer cadets at the @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity4 , december 18 , 1941 following instructions : the 1941 nazi christmas party was decorated with golden swastikas on the walls the 20 - page instruction leaflet from 1937 teaches @entity83 that @entity3 is @entity4 and how to decorate the perfect @entity84 ( pictured is @entity75 officer cadets during the 1941 @entity86 ) the manuscript goes on : ' the festival has been introduced against the wishes of the @entity90			1
priests had to to reinterpret it in a @entity70 light , in their favour , later on			0
the deep mystery of the @entity4 @entity2 can only be understood by those who feel its originality and authenticity			1
' this was part of the @entity1 hijacking of @entity2 , turning it into a form of pagan worship in which germanic myth and legends became central to the celebrations			1
' @entity107 is the @entity4 mother , ' says the manuscript , ' ' and @entity110 @entity109 is no longer located in the crib , but will be relocated in a cradle to stand for the constant renewal of the @entity4 people			2
' thus it was not the @entity116 ' but the @entity4 workers and peasants who flock to him ! ' said the guide discovered in the archives of the @entity122 in @entity10			1
presents , parents were advised , should be part of a game of hide - and - seek so that the ' entire festival will be celebrated without @entity128 , but as a germanic - fertility jubilee			2
' in the run up to the big day , it advised , the @entity131 pageant should be replaced in schools and kindergartens with ' fairy tale performances that put a @entity4 stamp on the history of @entity128 's birthday			0
' @entity28 , who was the @entity139 to so many @entity4 , was indeed to become the new @entity140 of the @entity4 people			0
a prayer was suggested for the family to say together : ' we spent @entity2 in the field , during combat , with the @entity4			2
one was always with us ... he is still with us			0
we greet him ! ' @entity147 is not meant to be @entity110 , but @entity28 , the ' saviour of the @entity4			0
