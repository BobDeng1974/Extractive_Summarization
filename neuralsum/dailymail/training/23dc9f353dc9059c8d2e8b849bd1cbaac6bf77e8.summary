it was an excruciating moment that left some wondering whether @entity1 was acting a little strange			1
having leaned in towards the already awkward - looking teenage daughter of a senator , he tries to kiss her on the head - to which she recoils			1
but 13 - year - old @entity7 insists she does n't think the vice-president is creepy			1
the incident was among a number of awkward moments at the swearing - in ceremony of the new @entity13 last week			1
pained : after posing with the family of senator @entity15 of @entity16 ( left ) , @entity1 leaned down to whisper something to @entity7 's daughter @entity18			1
she did not seem to enthused by what he had to say turned away : perhaps the most excruciatingly awkward part of the ceremony was when @entity1 tried to kiss @entity7 's daughter @entity18 on the head and she turned away @entity25 's father , senator @entity15 of @entity16 , said of his daughter : ' no , she does n't think the vice president is creepy			1
' he 's known my kids their whole lives			0
@entity1 was just being thoughtful			2
' he told @entity31 that mr @entity1 was simply leaning forward to offer her support for what would be a busy day in the public eye			2
he said : ' i could hear him			0
' he was whispering some encouragement to her about how when he was sworn in and his own daughter @entity38 was 13 and she felt awkward and uncomfortable and he was encouraging her about how to get through a day with lots of cameras and lots of folks watching			1
' he was being @entity1			2
he was being thoughtful and he was being sweet			0
' @entity43 with her father , senator @entity15 of @entity16 , and family at home stale jokes : @entity1 later used the same line when he met freshman senator @entity50 's ( in red ) teenage daughter @entity52 ( left ) earlier , @entity1 's humor had taken a somewhat creepier tone when he was introduced to @entity57 senator @entity56 's teenage granddaughter @entity55			1
@entity1 commented : ' i hope you have a big fence around the house ! ' the comment was made as @entity1 posed with the 80 - year - old @entity65 senator 's large family , on the day he officially became president pro tempore of @entity13			0
@entity1 thought the joke about the girl 's good looks so funny , he whipped it out again when he met the daughter of freshman senator @entity50			0
pictures from the event show @entity1 with his arm around the republican 's daughter @entity52 as senator @entity50 places her hand on a @entity78 to be sworn in			1
getting close : @entity1 was pictured with his arm around @entity52 as her mother was sworn in			2
the vp probably did n't make a great impression on @entity50 , since he called her by her husband 's name - @entity83 ( in red tie ) - when they met last week he probably wo n't be calling senator @entity50 up for favors anytime soon			0
in addition to the strange comment towards her daughter , @entity1 also got the senator 's name wrong at first - calling @entity50 by her husband 's name , @entity83			0
throughout the rest of the day , @entity1 continued to throw out flattery left and right			0
' as they say in southern @entity16 , ' boy , you married up , '' he told the husband of @entity104 republican @entity103			0
@entity1 has spent more than three decades in the senate .			0
