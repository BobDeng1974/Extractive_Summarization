@entity1 's secretive spy agency , the @entity0 , has been in possession of two space telescopes which are better than @entity4 - and has now decided to gift them to @entity6			1
sources say that the reason for the hand - me - down is because the @entity0 - motto : ' vigilance from above ' - has found even better technology			2
the revelations leads to questions over how long the @entity0 has had the satellites - which are said to have 100 times the field of view of @entity4 - and what exactly they were planning to use them for			2
a satellite spy company gifted @entity6 with two @entity4 telescopes after they said they had better technology available for newer telescopes ( file photo ) the space agency has confirmed that it received a pair of giant identical @entity4 telescopes , and said the spy agency built them and then decided it did n't need them			1
so , having decided they had no use for them , the @entity0 has now gifted the pair , which have been sat in their original wrappers in a warehouse in @entity35 , @entity36 , to the space agency			1
the trouble is , @entity6 is too cash - strapped to refurbish them - until at least 2024			1
even with this windfall , @entity6 has no money to launch the telescopes anytime soon			1
they have consistently been dealing with smaller budgets and fewer staff members			0
the transfer last summer was only recently declassified			0
the telescopes have mirrors similar in size to the famed @entity4 , but they are not ready for space - not by a long shot			0
for starters , they lack cameras and instruments essential for astronomy research			0
the equipment costs money - around $ 1billion , according to some estimates			0
dr @entity58 , a member of the @entity60 ’s @entity59 told @entity61 : ‘ a 50 per cent discount still means you have to come up with the other 50 per cent			0
’ one man 's trash : while the telescopes were given to @entity6 free of charge , they do not have the funds to launch them into space ( file photo ) the final frontier : the astrophysics director for @entity6 said that he hopes to launch the telescopes by 2024 , or sooner , ' if money is no object ' ( file photos ) @entity6 astrophysics director @entity77 told the @entity78 that the soonest @entity6 could hope to launch the telescopes was in 2024 , but said they might launch earlier ‘ if money is no object			1
’ he added that the initial framework means less overhead , and more that can potentially be spent on newer technologies			0
in total , the massive gifts will likely save the space agency some $ 250million down the road			2
however , until scientists have enough money for launches , the telescopes will remain in the @entity93 warehouse			0
neither the @entity0 or @entity6 would release pictures of the two telescopes			1
scientists hope @entity6 will repurpose one of the telescopes to study dark energy , the mysterious force that could explain the universe ’s expansion .			2

@entity6 gifted two telescopes by spy agency @entity0
however , @entity6 has no budget to refurbish or launch telescopes *...* until 2024
