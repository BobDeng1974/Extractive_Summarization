by @entity0 it is the first time since the @entity2 150 years ago that the laborious method of tintype photography has been used in the battlefield			1
when @entity9 @entity8 gunner ( and photographer ) @entity7 was posted to @entity11 this summer , he decided to capture his fellow soldiers not with a modern camera but using an outdated technique called tintype , resulting in a haunting series of pictures reminiscent of those taken by photographer @entity18 in the 1861 - 1865 @entity2			1
@entity7 , a staff sergeant in the @entity19 , was in @entity20 when he took the photographs using tintype photography , a process involving chemicals which is as time - consuming as it is fiddly , with each image taking several minutes to create			2
the tintypes were created by aerial gunner @entity7 during time on the ground between sorties - this photograph shows a technical sergeant based in @entity20 , @entity11 , earlier this year the tintypes were created by aerial gunner @entity7 during time on the ground between sorties - this photograph shows a technical sergeant based in @entity20 , @entity11 , earlier this year @entity37 - born @entity7 , 32 , would often have to drop his work and run to the helicopter when he was summoned on an urgent mission in his work on a @entity43 special operations helicopter			1
creating each image involved hand - pouring a chemical called collodion onto a sheet of metal which is made light - sensitive with a silver nitrate solution and then creating a direct positive onto it			2
a painstaking process with the wet plates , making tintypes was made harder still for @entity7 by the dry and dusty conditions in @entity20			2
@entity7 , who grew up in @entity55 and joined the @entity8 a month after graduating high school , served in @entity57 in @entity58 and then @entity59 near @entity60			0
he says it was during his time in @entity63 that he discovered a passion for art , and then left the military , travelling around @entity67 for years and developing his artistic style			0
in 2008 , @entity7 returned to @entity9 and enlisted in the @entity19			0
now living in @entity70 's @entity69 , he studies sculpture and also serves as a reserve aerial gunner as a defensive heavy weapons and tactics specialist			0
his work is reminiscent of that done by @entity9 war photographer @entity18 , who used the same method to take photographs of soldiers in battlefields around the country including @entity81 during the bloody war 150 years ago			0
risking their lives in hostile territory : this glamorous soldier is a major and co-pilot who served alongside @entity37 - born @entity7 in @entity20 earlier this year @entity7 's tintype photographs are reminiscent of those taken in the @entity2 , such as that of the corporal , left , and the volunteer , right , dating back to the 1860s this tintype photograph shows a @entity98 combat search and rescue helicopter - the photographer would often drop everything and run to it the stresses of combat , lack of basic materials , drying desert air , and the wind and dust of @entity11 challenged @entity7 's artistic ability - this image shows a pilot @entity7 said he chose the tintype method as he wanted to show the humanity behind the people involved in the horrors of war - this photograph shows a senior airman mechanic on active duty : this lined tintype image shows a staff sergeant pararescueman who was deployed in @entity11 alongside @entity7 in june this year old - fashioned method : the tintype method of photography has not been used in a combat zone since the @entity2 more than a century ago the stark photographs challenge the viewer to look for longer , possessing an historical quality that adds resonance to the subject - this photograph depicts a pilot the photographer , who was born in @entity37 and grew up in @entity55 , now lives in @entity70 's @entity69 , where he is studying sculpture - this image shows a technical sergeant and aerial gunner the tintype technique was last used on the battlefield in the @entity2 by photographer @entity18 , whose fascinating portrait of soldier in the 19th century are well - known the portraits show soldiers during the bloody conflict in @entity11 's @entity20 , and offer an alternative view of those involved in the war this technical sergeant in the @entity8 was serving in @entity20 this summer when @entity7 persuaded him to sit for a tintype photograph - he chose to pose with his gun same style : photographer @entity18 took this tintype picture of soldiers in the @entity2 - he was said to be good at persuading high brass to pose for him gun in hand , helmet at his feet , this senior master sergeant pararescueman smiles for the camera despite living through the horrors of war far from home on a daily basis this plate showing a first lieutenant co-pilot is among those created by 32 - year - old @entity7 , who is exclusively represented by the @entity169 in @entity70			1

@entity9 @entity8 aerial gunner @entity7 , 32 , from the @entity69 , spent time between sorties capturing images of soldiers
