by comparison , @entity14 ’s current @entity5 has a depth of 7.6mm , while the @entity85 is slightly thinner at 7.5mm			1
@entity23 's @entity86 is 7.9mm thick , while the @entity87 is 9.3mm			2

the files detail a display that appears to float 3d images , or holograms , above it , and these holograms can then be moved using finger gestures			0
this process involves a system that creates the 3d image , an optical system that puts this image into the air , and a touch sensor			0
according to the application , the hologram is created using infrared lasers - or similar devices - that project the image onto a surface above the display			0
this projection would then appear via the optical system , which could be situated between two parabolic or concave mirrors that have reflective surfaces facing each other			0

the images , pictured above and below , show how the @entity14 menu and alarm could work using this holographic system .			1
