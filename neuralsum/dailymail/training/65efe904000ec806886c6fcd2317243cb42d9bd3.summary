by @entity1 reporter published : 18:59 est , 31 march 2013 updated : 04:04 est , 1 april 2013 a man who has spent more than four decades in prison for a @entity5 hotel fire that killed 29 people , including some who jumped from windows to escape the searing heat , is expected to be released tuesday as part of a deal with prosecutors			1
@entity13 was convicted of murder as a teen but has maintained his innocence in the december 1970 fire at the @entity18			1
the @entity5 man , who turns 59 this week , is scheduled to plead no contest to murder in an agreement that sets aside his original conviction and gives him credit for time served , the @entity19 reported			1
to be free : @entity13 , 59 , who has spent more than four decades in prison for a @entity5 hotel fire that killed 29 people , is expected to be released tuesday as part of a deal with prosecutors the fire came during a @entity34 party for employees of an aircraft company and left many guests trapped in their rooms			1
the building had no sprinkler system , exits were locked to prevent theft , and fire truck ladders were too short to reach the higher floors			2
those factors led some people to jump from windows to their deaths			0
others burned to death in their rooms			0
most died of carbon - monoxide poisoning while waiting for rescue			0
in total , 29 lives were lost to the blaze , including one victim who died months later in a hospital			0
@entity13 , then 16 , was in the hotel that night watching the festivities			2
after the fire broke out , he and a hotel custodian tried to extinguish the blaze , then @entity13 helped some of the trapped and injured guests escape			1
hours later , he was taken into custody , interviewed by police without parental consent and charged with starting the fire			2
he was convicted in 1972 and sentenced to 28 concurrent life terms			0
judge @entity70 , who presided over @entity13 's 1972 trial , publicly expressed skepticism about the jury 's decision to convict the @entity5 teen			1
in one letter he sent @entity13 in the early 1980s , the judge , who died in december 2010 , said he was negotiating with @entity78 lawmakers to have the sentence commuted , but the deal was predicated on @entity13 admitting guilt , which he refused to do			1
a scanned postcard from the @entity83 , which @entity13 was convicted for burning down in october , attorneys with the @entity85 , a volunteer legal group that attempts to evaluate cases on behalf of inmates who believe they were wrongfully convicted , asked a court to dismiss the case or hold an evidentiary hearing			1
the attorneys said several defense experts , using modern forensic fire science , would testify they would not have ruled the blaze arson			0
the defense team also alleged a prosecutor engaged in misconduct by not giving defense attorneys a laboratory report that said no accelerants were found and by talking to the judge without defense attorneys present			0
@entity102 , one of the @entity85 lawyers advocating on behalf of @entity13 , said @entity13 maintains his innocence but will plead no contest as a way of getting out of prison quickly			1
@entity102 said sunday that @entity13 's lawyers believe he would have eventually prevailed , but thought the process could have taken another 18 months			2
an investigator with the @entity111 recently reviewed the available evidence in the case and was unable to determine what caused the blaze			0
however , prosecutor @entity116 said the original fire investigator for the prosecution still believes the blaze was purposely set , and the fire investigator who recently reviewed the case lacked access to a great deal of evidence			2
much of the evidence in the case was destroyed in the 1990s or disappeared after civil attorneys took possession of it when they sued the hotel			0
@entity116 said in an interview last month that even though defense experts were unable to determine the fire 's cause , that does n't mean it was n't arson			0
the prosecution 's original fire investigator stands by his 42 - year - old report , and other evidence presented at the 1972 trial indicated the fire was arson			0
sad day : the @entity18 fire came during a @entity34 party for employees of an aircraft company and left many guests trapped in their rooms			1

@entity13 , 59 , was convicted of murder as a teen but has maintained his innocence in the december 1970 fire at the @entity18
he is expected to be released tuesday as part of a deal with prosecutors
