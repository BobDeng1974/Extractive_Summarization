the @entity3 @entity2 makes no effort to determine the immigration status of adult relatives when they show up to claim unaccompanied minor children who entered the @entity3 illegally , a spokesman at the agency confirmed on wednesday			1
tens of thousands of the under - 18s – ' @entity10 ' ( @entity11 ) in government - speak – have poured across the @entity3 - @entity14 border in recent months , creating what president @entity15 has termed an ' urgent humanitarian situation			1
' @entity2 , which houses them until family members can be found , has begun releasing illegal immigrant children ' by the hundreds ' into the custody of adults who are illegal immigrants themselves , an @entity2 official familiar with the situation on @entity3 's southern border told @entity27 late on tuesday			1
an official spokesman for @entity2 's @entity29 confirmed on wednesday that the agency has no system in place to verify whether the adults are here legally			1
@entity34 told @entity27 on wednesday that ' around 90 percent of the minors in the @entity11 program are released to verified sponsors ( mostly family members ) in the @entity3 ' asked if ' verified ' means that the adults ' immigration status has been checked , he responded , ' no. ' he also answered ' no ' when asked if there is ' an effort made to ascertain the immigration status of the adults who claim the kids			1
@entity2 takes over after that , drawing on a $ 1 billion budget to house , feed and otherwise care for the children until a suitable adult family member can be located to claim them			1
the first @entity2 official , speaking on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to comment to the press , said his agency first tries to find a legal @entity3 resident related to each child to take custody			1
but barring that outcome , he cautioned , ' i know they 're more concerned with clearing the caseload than with the immigration status of the adult sponsors			1
' as many as 90,000 are expected to go through the system during the government 's fiscal year that ends on september 30			0
the official said the glut of cases at military bases serving as ' holding facilities ' threatens to ' overwhelm our ability to care for all these kids in the long - term			2
' ' it 's just not sustainable , is what i 'm telling you , ' he said			0
' so to bottom - line it , would you rather see these kids in glorified warehouses or reunited with a family member who does n't belong here ? ' according to official statistics from the @entity61 , deportations of illegal immigrants under the @entity15 administration have spiked to new highs			1
but those numbers are deceptive : changes in terminology have left head - counters with no choice but to roll several categories together , now classifying cases where immigrants are stopped and turned back at the border as ' deportations			2
' actual expulsions of people who have crossed the border unlawfully and then settled in @entity3 's interior are down more than 40 per cent since @entity15 's first year in office			1
the resulting contradiction allows @entity15 to publicly embrace a tough - on - immigration image while privately assuring his @entity139 constituency that he means to allow more @entity14 and @entity141 aliens to stay with each passing year			1
a scenario where @entity2 gradually mainstreams thousands of the children flooding into the @entity3 from south of the border by turning them over to undocumented adults would fit that pattern			1
former secretary of state @entity148 took issue with what appears to be an unprecedented immigration policy - in - the - making on tuesday night during a town hall broadcast on @entity153			0
mixed messages : the @entity155 held a ceremony on monday to honor ten young illegal immigrants as ' champions of change ' flood : @entity68 buses drive underage illegal immigrants from the border to temporary facilities where they are processed and given court dates before being transferred to @entity2 ' they should be sent back as soon as it can be determined who responsible adults in their families are , ' @entity166 said of the children			1
she told question - and - answer moderator @entity174 that ' all of them that can be should be reunited with their families ' in their home countries			2
' we have to send a clear message , ' @entity166 said : ' just because your child gets across the border , that does n't mean the child gets to stay			2
' tough : homeland security secretary @entity186 has left open the question of what happens when illegal immigrants try to claim their children , while insisting that he was ' not encouraging in any way , shape or form illegal migration ' if @entity166 decides to run for president , her position will land her in unusual company			2
@entity200 lawmakers have slammed the @entity15 administration for failing to enforce immigration law , and for instituting a ' @entity204 ' program in 2012 that cancels deportation orders for people brought into the @entity3 as children before june 2007			1
news of that policy , they argue , has filtered down to impoverished @entity141 and the human - trafficking ' coyotes ' who guide them , sherpa - like , through hundreds of miles of @entity14 wilderness			0
tens of thousands of children may believe they will benefit from what @entity217 insiders have termed @entity15 's ' mini-amnesty			1
' @entity166 will also find herself in agreement with federal judge @entity222 , who ruled in december that the @entity15 administration aided drug cartels by knowingly allowing a 10 - year - old @entity225 girl to complete her illegal trek into the @entity3 by reuniting her with her illegal immigrant mother in @entity228			1
the @entity61 , @entity222 wrote , is ' delivering the minors to the custody of the parent illegally living in the @entity3			2
' the agency also never prosecuted the mother or took any action to remove her from the @entity3			2
@entity222 wrote in his ruling that the case of @entity237 , who paid a trafficker $ 8,500 to bring her child across the border , was the fourth case he had seen in a month			2
@entity241 , he wrote , flew the children to multiple locations in order to locate their parents , even though they had no legal basis to be in the country			0
' the @entity61 has simply chosen not to enforce the @entity3 ' border security laws , ' according to @entity222			0
it is ' completing the criminal mission of individuals who are violating the border security of the @entity3			0
' according to @entity2 materials that @entity254 emailed to @entity27 last week , the @entity252 changed the federal government 's focus in these cases , ' to move towards a child welfare - based - model of care for children and away from the adult detention model			1
' ' the average length of stay in the program is currently near 35 days			0
of the children served , some 85 % are reunified with their families			0
' it 's unclear how many of those family members are in the @entity3 legally , and how many are outside the @entity3 @entity27 's source at @entity2 said he suspected the number staying in the @entity3 would grow ' as the space issues become harder to manage			1
' meanwhile , taxpayers cover expenses related to classroom education , recreation and mental health and medical services at facilities on military bases including @entity280 in @entity281 , @entity283 @entity282 in southern @entity284 and @entity285 in @entity53			0
but @entity2 's policy is to send most of them to ' state - licensed ' care providers licensed by its @entity288			2
that agency describes its mission as ' provid [ ing ] new populations with opportunities to maximize their potential in the @entity3 , linking people in need to critical resources to assist them in becoming integrated members of @entity3 society			0
' the @entity302 reported on friday that a church - funded shelter in @entity305 , @entity51 – ground zero for the rush of underage illegals – planned to shelter ' hundreds ... each week			0
' ' in the @entity311 alone , ' the sectarian newspaper reported , ' 13 shelters house the immigrant kids			0
catholic adults volunteer in all of them			0
the two largest facilities shelter up to 300 at a time			0
' @entity315 , associate director of children ’s services for the @entity318 , said that ' these are children			0
it is in our mandate as @entity323 to care about this population			0
' ' given opportunities to thrive , they will thrive , ' @entity315 said			0
' they are incredible people			0

the @entity3 @entity329 takes custody of tens of thousands of minors each year who cross the border without their parents
an official spokesman at the agency says there is ' no ' effort made to determine the adults ' immigration status
an @entity2 official says while the agency 's first choice is to find each child a relative who lives legally in the @entity3 , that 's not always possible
so some children are already being released to the care of illegal immigrants in their immediate or extended families
' they 're more concerned with clearing the caseload than with the immigration status of the adult sponsors , ' the source said
' would you rather see these kids in glorified warehouses or reunited with a family member who does n't belong here ? '
a federal judge ruled in december that the @entity15 administration is helping drug cartels and human traffickers by taking kids to live with illegal - immigrant parents who pay *smugglers* to bring them across the border
