by @entity0 last updated at 9:05 pm on 6th january 2012 only once all political prisoners are released and free and fair elections have been held will sanctions against @entity2 be lifted , according to the @entity6 foreign secretary			1
rounding off a two - day visit to the country , @entity7 said he welcomed recent reforms but warned that they were not enough for the sanctions to be eased			1
he spoke after meeting @entity2 pro-democracy leader @entity12 in @entity13 and said : ' what we ’ve seen so far is not sufficient , there are still political prisoners			1
tea for two : @entity7 met with pro-democracy leader @entity12 in @entity2 where the two agreed that more needed to be done in order for sanctions to be lifted afternoon stroll : @entity7 walked around the grounds of @entity12 's home , where she was once under house arrest , after talks about the future of @entity2 ' it is important that we do n’t relax the pressure prematurely and are clear on what we want the government here to do for us to change our policies			1
' much more needs to be done and it is vital that the remaining political prisoners be released			0
it 's not possible to say a country is fair and democratic while people are still in prison on the grounds of their political beliefs			0
' it is vital for them to be released if restrictive @entity48 measures are to be removed			0
@entity12 widely agreed with @entity7 , who has laid down four conditions for the easing of sanctions , during their historic meeting in her home where she was once placed under house arrest			1
@entity7 wants to see the release of hundreds of political detainees , an end to human rights abuses by the army , an effort to resolve ethnic conflicts and the holding of free and fair elections			2
she said : ' all political prisoners should be released and there should be all efforts made to put an end to all ethnic conflict within our country			0
certainly we would want to see free and fair by - elections			2
' friendship : @entity12 talks to the media as @entity7 looks on , during his two - day visit to @entity2 friendship : @entity7 pictured meeting informally with @entity2 pro-democracy leader @entity12 yesterday on the first day of his trip the news conference was held on the lawn of @entity12 's lakeside home , where she spent years under house arrest until her release days after a general election in november 2010			1
the pair strolled around the grounds after their talks			0
@entity7 added : ' i hope we 're at a stage where we can say a long - held dream now has a chance of being realised , but there 's so much work to be done			1
' the long darkness in which the people of this country have lived may be coming to an end			0
' @entity7 is the first foreign minister from the former colonial power to visit @entity2 since 1955			1
the army seized power in a 1962 coup			0
the new civilian administration quickly embarked on political and economic reforms last year , to the surprise of many , given the number of former junta officials in its ranks			2
other developed countries are cautiously seeking to engage with @entity2 's new rulers			2
they are keen to improve living conditions in the country but also to let their companies invest in its rich natural resources , which are already being exploited by @entity118 countries such as @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity121			0
discussions : @entity7 ( left ) spoke with @entity2 president @entity123 during a meeting at the president 's residence in @entity127 yesterday talks : @entity7 ( left ) with his @entity2 counterpart @entity129 during a meeting in @entity127 yesterday two @entity13 - based sources said today that @entity2 had awarded 10 onshore oil and gas blocks to eight firms in its biggest energy tender in years and was offering nine offshore blocks			1
the winning firms were mostly from @entity118 , the sources , with direct knowledge of the deals , said			0
@entity7 is in a tricky situation , wanting to encourage the reformers led by president @entity123 but liable to face criticism at home if he seems to be cosying up to former junta members , including @entity123 , still pulling the strings			2
he said : ' i think they 're sincere , particularly the president			0
the risk of how foreign governments engage with this is that we assume it 's all done and forget that this is only part way through			0
' we must not relax our efforts prematurely			0
that 's the risk we must guard against			0
' @entity12 , the daughter of the leader of the campaign for independence from @entity6 , is important because of her influence at home and abroad			1
analysts and diplomats say that if she withdrew her long - standing support for sanctions , that would make it easier for @entity6 and others to scale down the embargoes			1
a @entity6 diplomat said : ' she 's crucial to driving this process			2
she has a lot of sway			0
' @entity12 has recently shown a willingness to compromise and plans to run for parliament in by - elections on april 1			1
the new government may be happy to see her there : @entity12 and her party will give the assembly more legitimacy but it will still be controlled by an army - dominated party plus military representatives who have a quarter of the seats			2
touch down : @entity7 pictured on his arrival at @entity187 yesterday at the start of an historic visit to @entity2 greetings : @entity7 is met by @entity2 deputy foreign minister @entity191 after arriving in @entity2 yesterday the authorities formally registered her @entity194 ( @entity194 ) as an authorised party yesterday			1
parliamentary speaker @entity196 , a powerful member of the former junta , made it clear to @entity198 he wanted @entity12 on board			2

and yesterday , the @entity48 said it planned to open a representative office in the main city , @entity13			0
