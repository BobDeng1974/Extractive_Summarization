he told the magazine : ' i told the government i ’d volunteer for prison , as long as it served the right purpose … i care more about the country than what happens to me			1

' @entity0 faces espionage charges in the @entity3 that carry a sentence of up to 30 years but @entity10 has no extradition treaty with @entity93			1
@entity0 , the former government contractor who instigated the biggest leak of government documents in @entity3 history , has been living in @entity98 after seeking asylum from @entity10 @entity31 not only has the capability to detect incoming cyberattacks but can also counterattack - with no human intervention at all , according to @entity0			1
this could lead to catastroph because cyberattacks are often routed through computers in innocent third countries			2

in his latest interview with @entity12 , @entity0 said the @entity27 has exaggerated the number of documents that he stole from them - a number far lower than the 1.7million that has been claimed			1
the it specialist said that he purposely left a digital trail so that investigators could tell exactly what he took and what he only touched - but government auditors did n't find it			2
he said : ' i figured they would have a hard time			0
i did n’t figure they would be completely incapable			0
' he speculated that the documents he stole - the majority of which he has not read - may hold a secret about a senior government figure which would destroy careers			1
he said : ' i think they think there ’s a smoking gun in there that would be the death of them all politically			0
' the fact that the government ’s investigation failed - that they do n’t know what was taken and that they keep throwing out these ridiculous huge numbers - implies to me that somewhere in their damage assessment they must have seen something that was like , '' @entity167 s * * *			0
'' and they think it ’s still out there			0
' he refused to answer whether he believed his leak of confidential documents influenced the reported leaks of more documents from the @entity3 intelligence community but spoke of the @entity27 's lack of control over its own sprawling operation			1
@entity0 told @entity12 that he would be happy to go to prison for his actions but that he wanted it to be for the right reasons @entity0 said of the agency : ' they still have n’t fixed their problems			2
they still have negligent auditing , they still have things going for a walk , and they have no idea where they ’re coming from and they have no idea where they ’re going			0
' and if that ’s the case , how can we as the public trust the @entity27 with all of our information , with all of our private records , the permanent record of our lives ? ' @entity0 spoke of his concerns over program @entity31 which had the ability to not only detect cyberattacks but would respond - without any human involvement in the decision			1
@entity0 said that because cyberattacks are often routed through innocent third party countries that leaves the @entity3 open to unwittingly making an enemy out of someone who was not involved			1
there are other disturbing shock waves from the actions of the @entity27 , @entity0 told @entity12			1
when @entity218 lost internet connection in the midst of its civil war in 2012 , the outage was caused by the @entity27 , @entity0 claimed			1

but the @entity3 government operation failed - and instead , the hacking attempt blocked a router in @entity218 , causing the entire country to be thrown offline			2
@entity12 's september issue with cover story , @entity237 , is on newsstands on august 26			0
