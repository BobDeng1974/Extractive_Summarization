by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 , who took to @entity3 his campaign for his second shot at @entity6 , is refusing to sign - on for a second re-match should he win at @entity8			1
as he prepares to box in front of a record 80,000 crowd , @entity2 has vetoed a contract clause for a third @entity13			1
@entity2 roused a clamour of public support when he petitioned the @entity16 to impose saturday night 's mandatory defence on @entity6 but is unwilling to make the same commitment in return			1
no third meeting : @entity2 will not offer @entity6 a rematch if he wins their second fight on saturday relaxed : @entity2 is confident he can right the wrongs of the first fight and beat @entity6 to become world champion @entity6 smiles wryly at being ordered by the @entity16 — whose world super-middleweight title he holds — to oblige his young challenger			1
the irony is not lost on him that @entity2 has insisted on deleting from the multi-million - pound contract a clause providing for a third fight in the event that he wins this time			1
@entity6 says : ‘ accidents can happen in the ring but it ’s interesting that @entity2 wo n’t offer me another rematch if he gets lucky			1
and while i ’m fighting him again he never gave a second chance to @entity40			0
’ that is a reference to the @entity44 super-middleweight title fight in 2010 to which @entity40 came as a late substitute with a few days ’ training			2
@entity40 shocked @entity2 with an early knockdown before being stopped in the sixth round			0
his calls for a rematch with time to prepare went unheeded			0
one time only : @entity2 opted not to have a rematch with @entity40 after beating him in @entity52 second time around : @entity6 beat @entity53 in their rematch at the @entity56 last may @entity57 can argue @entity40 lapsed into amphetamine use soon after			2
but that remains the only defeat on the @entity62 ’s 19 - fight record ; he has since won the @entity64 title			0
another fight between them would not have reached the magnitude that is gripping the nation this weekend			0
can @entity69 live up to expectations , equal or surpass the excitement of five months ago ? both men believe so			0
@entity2 says : ‘ this will be a great fight , even if it is one @entity6 can not win in the end			1
i will knock him out in the third			0
’ @entity6 says : ‘ @entity2 is getting stopped			2
probably in the mid-to - late rounds but sooner if he tries to fulfil that early prediction			0

@entity2 vetoes a contract clause for a third @entity13
@entity6 says *26* - year - old may not be confident ahead of saturday 's *showdown*
