a mysterious illness doctors are comparing to polio has struck down up to 25 children in @entity3 over the past year , leaving them with paralyzed limbs and a bad prognosis			1
the children , aged between two and 16 , all suffered paralysis of the arms or legs and some experienced respiratory difficulties			1
' what 's we 're seeing now is bad			0
the best case scenario is complete loss of one limb , the worst is all four limbs , with respiratory insufficiency as well			1
it 's like the old polio , ' @entity18 , a pediatric neurologist at @entity19 in @entity20 , @entity3 , told @entity23			1
while the symptoms appear like polio , tests reveal that none of the children have the disease that plagued 20,000 @entity30 a year before a vaccine was created in 1955			1
only three countries in the world still have polio : @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37			0
while studying five of the sick children to present at a medical conference , neurologists discovered that two of them tested positive for enterovirus 68 , a rare virus that can cause polio - like symptoms			1
before the development of a vaccine in 1955 , some 20,000 @entity30 children were infected with the illness every year			2
the virus mostly affected children under the age of three , which is why it was also called infantile paralysis			1
polio is spread from person to person , mainly through ingesting contaminated food or water			0
most who become infected with the virus are asymptomatic , meaning they do n't even get sick			0
but one to five in 1000 cases can experience paralyzation			0
most paralyzation cases are caused by spinal polio which leads to paralysis in the legs			1
unfortunately for those who caught spinal polio before the immunization , there was no cure and paralysis was permanent			2
polio has since been eradicated in @entity30 and most of the world			0
only three countries have had polio uninterrupted : @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37			0
other countries have experienced outbreaks of polio after eradication			2
the recent turmoil in @entity92 has led to cases being reported there , as well as in @entity95 and @entity96			0
in the @entity30 , children receive four doses of the inactive polio vaccine ( @entity100 ) to guard against the illness			1
the other three children either were n't tested or were n't tested soon enough to have yielded results			0
there are more than 100 types of enterovirus that infect 10 to 15 million people in the @entity30 each year			0
while enterovirus can sometimes cause serious symptoms , most people who catch the virus do n't get sick or only see mild symptoms			2
this specific brand of enterovirus was first discovered in @entity3 in 1962 when four children got sick with the respiratory illness			1
since 2000 , the @entity118 has recorded just 47 cases			0
but enterovirus 68 does n't account for all the cases			0
@entity122 tested negative for the virus , and she was one of the first - known cases in the outbreak			2
in 2012 , then two - year - old @entity40 was admitted to hospital with breathing problems			1
her mother , @entity128 , 37 , told @entity129 that her daughter @entity40 began wheezing and vomiting and was rushed to hospital			2
she spent four days in hospital after being diagnosed with asthma and was discharged			0
@entity128 knew something else was wrong			0
the toddler had full use of her left arm when she left the hospital but 24 hours later at a follow - up appointment , @entity128 noticed the girl was n't moving her left arm			1
she was taken for an mri scan but neurologists could n't work out what caused her paralysis			0
' i will never forget his face , when he came out to tell me the findings of the @entity152 , ' @entity128 says of the radiologist who read @entity155 's mri scan			0
' he actually took her images to a pediatric neuroradiology conference to gather more opinions			0
' mysterious afflication : the polio - like illness has affected up to 25 children in @entity3 @entity155 has undergone intense physical and occupational therapy to restore function to her arm , but nothing helped			1
she had surgery nerve transplant in april 2013 but @entity128 says the family may have to wait a further two - and - a - half years before they know if it was effective			2
right now , @entity155 's arm is completely flaccid and her muscles are shriveled from lack of use			2
' @entity155 was completely healthy one day and paralyzed the next week , ' says @entity128			0
she ca n't think of anything that could have caused her daughter 's sudden serious illness , except a virus that went around her sons ' school			1
now four , @entity155 improved little after her illness and now has a paralyzed left arm , weakness in her left leg and some breathing problems			1
otherwise , she is a happy , healthy pre-schooler , and @entity128 is grateful the mystery illness was n't worse			0
' we know we are lucky that the virus did not affect other areas of her spine as that may have caused paralysis of her legs or worse , all four limbs , ' she says			2
' as we were leaving the doctor 's office , i noticed that she went to grab something with her left arm and she stopped , midway , ' @entity128 told @entity23			1
@entity18 and other @entity3 neurologists searched recent medical files and found that there were more cases			0
mid-century disease : iron lungs in the @entity207 in @entity208 during the @entity210 epidemic sweeping @entity211 in 1955 the @entity213 's neurological surveillance team began to investigate the mystery illness			1
dr @entity215 , leader of the team investigating the illnesses , called a doctor 's request for polio testing for a young patient ' concerning ' because polio has been eradicated in the @entity30 and the child had not traveled overseas			1
the symptoms sometimes occur after a mild respiratory illness			2
@entity215 said a virus that is usually associated with respiratory illness but which has also been linked to polio - like illnesses was detected in two of the patients			1
@entity18 will present five cases of the disease at the @entity234 's upcoming annual meeting in @entity235			0
all five experienced paralysis of the limbs that became most severe within two days			1
none had recovered any limb function after six months			0
' we do n't have a final case count , but it 's probably in the neighborhood of 25 cases , all in @entity3 , ' @entity18 told @entity23 .			1

an *unknown* illness has affected up to 25 children in @entity3
it has similar symptoms to polio , including limb paralysis and respiratory difficulties
affected children have experienced paralysis in their arms or legs , which does not improve
@entity40 was the first known case in 2012
now four years old , she *retains* a paralyzed left arm , breathing problems and leg weakness from the ordeal
the @entity213 's neurological surveillance team is investigating
two of the children were diagnosed with a virus that sometimes causes polio - like symptoms
