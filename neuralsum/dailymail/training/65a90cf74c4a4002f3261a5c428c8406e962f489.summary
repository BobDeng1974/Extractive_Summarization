by @entity0 warning : @entity1 fears traditional voters are deserting @entity3 @entity3 ’s revolt over @entity6 ’s leadership deepened last night after a member of his @entity8 declared the party was being deserted by its traditional supporters			1
@entity1 – who has been tipped as a future leader of the party – became the first frontbencher to break ranks since @entity3 ’s recent run of poor election results			1
she warned mr @entity6 that his blue - collar supporters were abandoning the party for @entity18 because @entity3 was taking them ‘ for granted ’			1
the party was beaten into second place by @entity18 in last month ’s @entity21 elections			1
on top of that it made only limited gains in the local council poll and came a distant third in last thursday ’s @entity27 by - election			1
mr @entity6 ’s personal ratings have also remained persistently dire , leading many experts to question his credentials as a plausible prime minister			0
ms @entity1 , the @entity33 and @entity34 , told a gathering of senior @entity3 figures on the day of the @entity27 poll that after several weeks ‘ on the doorstep ’ she had discovered that the party ’s vote was plummeting in seats ‘ that were previously safe ’			1
she said : ‘ traditional voters , who perhaps at times we took for granted but had nowhere else to go , are now being offered an alternative by @entity18			2
‘ our voters , if i can still call them that , see @entity18 [ as ] a party who are offering a vision and a hope that things can be better			2
‘ they hear something from that party that resonates with them and with their fears for the future and that ’s something very real that we have to contend with and it ’s something real that we have to contend with for two reasons			0
‘ first of all , for purely electoral reasons , we have to hold on and build that coalition again of our traditional voters			0
‘ the @entity3 came into existence to give a voice for ordinary working people			0
what i saw ... were middle class , public sector , well - educated young graduates voting @entity3 , but the people who the @entity3 was set up to help , abandoning us			0
’ ms @entity1 , who worked as a @entity70 economist before being selected for @entity71 at the 2010 election on an all - women shortlist , concluded : ‘ our very raison d’etre will be threatened if the working people , who the @entity3 have got to be there for , and got to be a voice for , start to drift away because they do n’t see us as the answer			1
’ new threat : ms @entity1 said @entity3 voters are being offered an alternative by @entity18 , who beat the party in the @entity27 by - election			1
pictured above are @entity85 candidate @entity84 , left , with leader @entity86 she made her remarks at a conference branded ‘ @entity92 ’ – the political slogan adopted by mr @entity6 – held at @entity94 , alongside other senior @entity3 figures including policy co-ordinator @entity90 and shadow health minister @entity91			0
last week seven rebel @entity95 , including @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98 , published an open letter to mr @entity6 which argued that the unrestricted entry of @entity102 citizens from eastern @entity21 since 2004 was hurting the ‘ very communities that the @entity3 was founded to represent ’			2
the @entity95 argued that concern with immigration had become an important priority for a large proportion of working - class and middle - class voters			0
they added : ‘ while the benefits of mass migration have been served in abundance to many wealthy people , who are in a position to take advantage of cheap labour , we believe that the lack of affordable housing , school places , hospital capacity and transport infrastructure to accommodate this influx of people means that poorer people ’s living standards have been squeezed			0
’ last night a spokesman for ms @entity1 said : ‘ the @entity3 is building support across @entity127 with our plans to freeze energy bills , guarantee patients a gp appointment within 48 hours and reform our banking system			2

frontbencher @entity1 broke ranks at a @entity137 conference this week
