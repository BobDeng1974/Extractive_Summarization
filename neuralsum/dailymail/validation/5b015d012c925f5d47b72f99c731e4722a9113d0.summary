relations between the @entity1 and @entity2 took a significant leap forward with an historic meeting between its president @entity5 and the @entity6 today			1
president @entity5 , whose @entity8 leadership was once derided by the @entity9 as ' appalling old waxworks ' warmly shook hands with his son @entity12 and heaped praise on the @entity14			1
the two men met in the imposing @entity16 - home of the @entity18 - where the president highlighted their past interest in his country and told of how they had contributed ' positively ' to co-operation between @entity2 and @entity1			1
he also extended an open invitation to the @entity25 and her family to come to @entity2 , which could pave the way for a visit by the heir to the throne			2
' over the years the @entity43 has shown great interest in , and support for @entity2 / @entity1 relations			1
and members of the @entity43 have done a lot and contributed positively to ( the ) changes and co-operation between our two countries in areas ranging from trade to environment protection ... and cultural exchanges			0
' he added : ' i know this is @entity60 ' first visit to @entity2			2
in @entity2 we have two sayings , first , hearing about something is not as good as seeing it			2
' and the second saying is hearing about something 100 times is not the same as seeing it once			0
' so i very much welcome your royal highness and other members of the @entity43 to make ( a ) visit to @entity2 and see more parts of @entity2			2
' the president also passed on his good wishes about @entity12 's second child expected next month and ' congratulated ' the @entity6 and @entity75 on the imminent birth			1
he concluded by saying ; ' i 'm sure your royal highnesses visit to @entity2 will be a productive visit and a visit of building friendships , ( it will ) surely go a long way to developing mutual understanding and friendly ties between @entity2 and @entity1 people and i would like to wish your visit a great success			1
' in response @entity12 thanked the president ' enormously ' for inviting him to the @entity16 and said : ' it 's been a long interest of mine , for many years , to come and visit @entity2			1
' he told the @entity2 leader he was going to have an informative few days adding : ' i look forward to as you say strengthening @entity1 / @entity2 relations and building things for the future			1
' @entity12 , who is an @entity100 fan , added : ' i also gather you 're quite a football fan , i 'm looking forward to learning about @entity2 's football ! ' the prince - who has left pregnant wife @entity75 back in @entity1 - said the @entity35 is ' beautiful and lovely ' he looked relaxed during his day in @entity33 , where the @entity103 hope he can foster good relations with @entity2 prince @entity12 , who is on a week - long tour of the @entity106 , flew into @entity2 last night from @entity107 for one of the most high - profile – and diplomatically sensitive – tours of his fledgling royal career			1
with @entity2 on course to overtake the @entity114 as the world 's largest economy , the @entity1 government is keen to foster positive diplomatic relationships - and @entity12 's visit is being seen as a key part of those efforts			1
stepping foot for the first time on @entity2 soil , the second in line to the throne became the most senior member of the royal family to visit the country since the @entity25 nearly 30 years ago			1
in truth , many had believed that @entity12 's father , prince @entity132 , would be the first to stake that claim			1
the @entity25 's heir has been assiduously courting the @entity2 in recent years on behalf of his charities , setting up a number of initiatives in the country , including @entity139 ( @entity2 ) and an organisation to preserve historic architecture			2
he has also met with several senior @entity8 leaders in the @entity1			0
however he has also made no secret of his personal , and deeply held , opposition to @entity2 actions in @entity146 , regularly welcoming their exiled spiritual leader , the @entity147 ( reviled in @entity33 as a dangerous separatist ) , to @entity150			1
the prince chats with a crowd of well - wishers outside the @entity1 ambassador 's official residence in @entity33 @entity12 admitted his @entity2 is coming along ' slowly ' , and is mainly limited to greeting ' @entity156 ' the pair have even been photographed holding hands			1
after taking part in the formal handover of the former @entity1 colony of @entity162 in 1997 to @entity2 , @entity132 also memorably described the officials taking part in ceremony as ' appalling old waxworks '			1
two years later he let it be known he was boycotting a @entity169 banquet in honour of the then visiting president of @entity2 , @entity171			2
@entity12 's grandfather , prince @entity172 , also has form in the country			1
during the @entity25 's 1986 visit to @entity2 he memorably caused enormous offence by telling a group of @entity1 students : ' if you stay here much longer , you 'll all be slitty eyed			1
' following his meeting with the president , @entity12 visited the exquisite @entity35 – the ancient home of @entity2 's deposed emperors			1
the future king toured the former imperial palace – home to emperors and their households for nearly 500 years – on the first full day of his tour of @entity2			2
accompanied by @entity190 , vice-director of foreign affairs at the @entity35 and an interpreter , he was given a guided tour of the stunning 15th century complex in dazzling sunshine			2
also present was @entity196 , @entity1 's new ambassador to @entity2 and the first - ever woman in the role and @entity200 , @entity201			1
they were joined by a large security detail as they crossed a bridge over a semi-frozen moat into the inner courtyard to take in several of the main palaces			0
@entity12 listened intently as his guide described the construction and history of the vast landmark			2
he said : ' the sheer scale of it is phenomenal			0
' as he posed for photographs in front of the imposing @entity217 , he was asked how his @entity2 was coming along			0
he laughed and replied : ' very slowly			0
' @entity12 thanked the president ' enormously ' for inviting him to the @entity16 and said : ' it 's been a long interest of mine , for many years , to come and visit @entity2 ' the president also passed on his good wishes about @entity12 's second child expected next month and ' congratulated ' the @entity6 and @entity75 on the imminent birth responding to the @entity227 greeting @entity228 , he said : ' @entity156			1
that 's about as far as i have got			0
' the @entity6 was shown giant bronze urns once used to burn pine - scented incense and fill the courtyard below the palaces with clouds of smoke , giving the impression the @entity238 was sitting heaven			0
he said : ' it must have smelled fantastic			0
' he paused to admire an ornate throne room in the @entity243 , where @entity238 from the @entity244 onwards received ministers and officials			0
above the intricately carved throne , flanked by statues of cranes – the symbol of longevity in @entity2 – hangs an imperial motto in ancient @entity2 characters			2
roughly translated it reads : ' build yourself up in order to contribute to your nation			0
' @entity12 was told how each of the ' golden bricks ' in the floor were baked from highly prized type of mud			0
mr @entity190 said : ' unfortunately today we can not make a replica of the bricks because the quality of soil in @entity2 has changed and we do n't have the craftsmanship			0
' @entity12 joked : ' that 's a shame , you can have them made of gold now			2
' admiring the view of ancient temples and palaces on the hill beyond the @entity35 's 10m - high walls , he also noticed building work taking place across the skyline			1
he said : ' there is an amazing contrast between the old and the new here			0
' as he left to attend lunch with the @entity284 , @entity12 thanked his hosts			0
mr @entity190 told him : ' welcome to @entity2 , we did n't have time to visit all of the @entity35 today , just a small portion			1
' during a whistlestop tour of the @entity35 , @entity12 admired the view of ancient temples and palaces on the hill beyond the 10m - high walls it came the @entity6 took part in a ' @entity298 ' promotion at the @entity1 ambassador 's official residence the @entity6 , whose whistlestop tour lasted just 35 minutes , replied : ' it feels like a very big portion			1
' it 's beautiful and lovely , thank you so much for showing me around			2
i hope that you manage to conserve it going forward			0
it 's such a massive area			0
' built between 1406 and 1420 , the @entity2 imperial palace was home to 24 emperors , 14 of the @entity244 and 10 of the @entity314			0
the last emperor , @entity315 , abdicated in 1912 but was allowed to remain in the @entity316 until a coup in 1924			0
it is now a museum housing some 1.8million items and attracts more than 15 million visitors a year			0
it contains 980 buildings , including 90 palaces and courtyards , 8,704 rooms and is the largest collection of preserved wooden structures in the world , covering 150,000 square metres			0
later today he will fly to @entity331 to embark on a concerted push to promote @entity1 business and culture when he opens the government 's great festival of creativity at the city 's @entity339			0
the festival is designed to showcase @entity1 innovation and creativity in everything from fashion to health , technology , education and entertainment			0
it 's a packed programme of engagements and while there is palpable disappointment that the prince 's wife , the @entity75 , had been forced to remain at home due to the advanced stage of her second pregnancy , @entity12 has made the right noises so far , it seems .			1
