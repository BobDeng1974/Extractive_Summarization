at first glance , they appear an odd couple : the beautiful , 24 - year - old @entity4 darling @entity5 and rangy , 37 - year - old @entity8 crooner @entity7			1
yet they ’ve been photographed together strolling off a private jet and spotted backstage together at his concert			1
@entity5 , star of not one but two hit franchises , @entity14 and @entity15 , is @entity4 ’s most in - demand leading lady			1
presumably she has her pick of men			2
so who does miss @entity4 choose ? none other than @entity7 , a dad of two from @entity28			1
he , of course , has form in the starry dating arena , having recently consciously uncoupled from another @entity18 winner and @entity22 face , @entity17			1
to attract one @entity18 hottie might be good fortune , but two says the guy has something few others can offer			2
and if two @entity18 blondes were n’t enough , he ’s been spotted with @entity39 , too , and tv presenter @entity40 , although his people have denied he dated her			1
but no one can deny he bats at a very high level			2
the @entity47 singer has carved out a niche so specific that only he occupies it so what is it about @entity7 that women find so irresistible ? the answer is that he has carved out a niche so specific that only he occupies it			1
it makes him catnip to rich , @entity57 celebrity women who fancy themselves as having liberal values but also have middle - class aspirations			2
to start with — his looks			0
as one friend who has met him says : ‘ he ’s good - looking but not absurdly so ; it ’s not like @entity66 underwear model @entity64 where looks become the whole point			0
he sort of grows on you			0
and he ’s very trim and fit			0
’ he has always been clean - living , but years with @entity17 have refined him into a healthy - eating person who works out , and it shows			1
there were pictures of him doing cartwheels to impress @entity5			1
but while lots of men are handsome and fit , very few are rock stars — and , of course , @entity7 ’s role as @entity47 ’s voice , heart and soul is his key calling card			1
he plays piano , keyboard and guitar and writes most of the words and music			0
even better , if he falls in love with you , he writes songs for you , like a @entity94 poet crafting sonnets to his love			0
fix you , the song he wrote for @entity17 in 2005 after her father died , is one of the most moving expressions of grief in recent years			1
already an @entity18 winner , @entity103 has her pick of the men , so she goes for none other than @entity7 , a dad of two from @entity28 he has always been clean - living , but years with @entity17 have refined him into a healthy - eating person who works out , and it shows a handsome , musical - genius rock star will , of course , be inundated with offers			1
but unlike most rock stars , @entity7 is a well - brought - up , upper - middle - class boy of some academic distinction who just happens to be a musician			1
in spite of his fame and 80 million records sold , he knows how to hold a knife and fork , will open doors and can converse on @entity121			0
and he is @entity122 , a sign of refinement in some @entity126 eyes			0
to a @entity4 girl , he must seem like elegance personified , a lyricist of startling imagination with a trump card : that male rarity , emotional intelligence			1
which brings us to his very @entity122 , privileged background			0
@entity7 was brought up by @entity137 , 73 , a retired chartered accountant , magistrate and president of the local cricket club , and @entity142 , 60 , a music teacher , in a beautiful @entity144 grade ii - listed pile set in eight acres , with a paddock for ponies and a tennis court , in the hamlet of @entity149 near @entity150			1
the eldest of five , he was educated at traditional , fee - paying @entity151 ( alma mater of such @entity122 gents as @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity156 , father of @entity157 )			0
his father is believed to be a multi-millionaire from the sale of the slightly - less - grand - sounding @entity161 of @entity150 , a caravan company founded by @entity7 ’s grandfather in 1929			1
from @entity164 , @entity7 went to @entity165 , @entity166 and read @entity167 , graduating with a first - class degree			2
@entity47 was formed with friends there , but sensible @entity7 refused to release an album until after their finals			1
hell - raiser he most certainly is not			0
he ’s so well - behaved that some rival male rock stars , and some men in general , find him rather annoying			0
typically ungentlemanly , @entity177 ’s @entity176 said : ‘ @entity7 looks like a geography teacher			2
’ a man i know who spent a weekend with him said : ‘ he made a pious speech about how he always carried his own bags			0
’ a speech many women would find endearing , but which makes some men want to hit him			2
so : posh , educated , well - mannered and rich , too			0
some female stars are happy to date backing dancers , fitness trainers , and men who ’ve stalked them on @entity190 , but the likes of @entity5 do n’t want to worry whether a prospective beau is more smitten by their celebrity status and hard cash than their lovely self			2
plus , he ’s far from a publicity - seeker			0
if it always seemed churlish that he avoided being photographed with @entity17 , he is not about to post more embarrassingly compromising pictures of @entity5 on the internet or tweet a photo of their main course			1
people who ’ve met him say he ’s ‘ insanely funny — you ca n’t stop laughing ’ ; and @entity207 , the comic actor , is one of his children ’s godfathers			0
which brings us to possibly the most compelling part of the @entity7 love - god story : @entity17			1
that he ’s been through tough house - training by the perfectionist actress has proven him a fitting husband			0
he ’s also very obviously a hands - on father to @entity218 , ten , and @entity219 , eight			0
‘ he ’s the sort of chap who can cook a roast , chat to your parents , cheer up a friend and play with the children , ’ says my friend			0
@entity5 is younger and more devil - may - care than her predecessor — she once admitted vomiting at an @entity18 ’ after - party with some pride in her voice			2
the romance is not yet three months old			0
one thing ’s for sure , though : if it does n’t work out , mr @entity7 , given that he ’s rich , funny , handsome , discreet , kind , and emotionally literate , should have no trouble finding a replacement .			2
