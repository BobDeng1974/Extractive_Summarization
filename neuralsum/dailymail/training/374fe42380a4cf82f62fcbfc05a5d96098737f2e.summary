by @entity0 published : 09:57 est , 10 july 2013 updated : 10:11 est , 10 july 2013 sen. @entity1 said the @entity2 will take a ' second look ' at how it accounts for @entity5 soldiers the @entity2 is set to take a ' second look ' at how it goes about accounting for missing @entity7 on foreign battlefields , as they try to account for tens of thousands of @entity5 soldiers from previous wars the @entity7 estimates there are more than 83,000 @entity7 missing from @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14			1
the disclosure of an internal assessment revealed that the current accounting of @entity5 soldiers is ' acutely dysfunctional ' and at risk of failure , the @entity2 said yesterday			1
' we have a sacred obligation to perform this mission well , ' @entity2 press secretary @entity20 told reporters , referring to the @entity25 , or @entity25 , which is based in @entity26 and run by a two - star general			1
over the past three years , @entity25 has reported an average of 69 identifications of recovered remains per year , down from 85 per year over the previous three years			1
@entity31 is demanding that it make at least 200 identifications per year starting in 2015 , a target it is widely expected to miss. the @entity0 reported on sunday that a 2012 internal assessment of @entity25 's field operations - including the search for and recovery and identification of remains -- found it suffers from ineptitude , waste and mismanagement			1
@entity25 leaders suppressed the study but the @entity0 obtained a copy after it had been denied to others who requested it under the @entity48			1
' we 're going to review the concerns raised in the report to see how @entity25 is or is n't functioning well , ' @entity20 said			1
' and if steps need to be taken to remedy what 's happening inside @entity25 , then we 'll take action			1
this is an important mission			1
' the @entity56 , the investigative arm of @entity31 , also has examined @entity25			1
members of the @entity25 , @entity25 , right , and @entity58 soldiers search for remains of @entity7 soldiers killed during the 1950 - 53 @entity62 in @entity13 ( pictured in 2009 ) a @entity2 spokesman , lt. col. @entity63 , said the @entity2 has responded to the @entity56 's findings and recommendations and expects the results to be made public shortly			1
separately , members of @entity31 pressed the @entity2 and @entity25 for answers			2
sen. @entity1 , @entity69 , wrote to @entity25 's commander , maj. gen. @entity70 , to request a copy of the internal report and other documentation			2
' we 've got a responsibility to make sure this program is being run in a responsible manner , and i will not rest until we have answers , ' @entity1 said			2
she is chairman of a subcommittee that focuses on government waste and fraud			2
@entity20 said the @entity2 's review would be undertaken by the office of @entity85 , the undersecretary of defense for policy , who oversees @entity25 and other aspects of the @entity2 's efforts to resolve the cases of missing service members			2
he said he could not yet spell out the exact parameters of the review			0
asked why @entity85 acted now , @entity20 said not all of the problems cited in the internal @entity25 report had been brought to the attention of senior @entity2 officials until after the @entity0 wrote about them			0
' some of these concerns , quite frankly , did n't bubble up , ' @entity20 said			0
' and it 's important when these concerns are raised to take a look , so i think it 's the prudent thing to do			0
' the issues were not fully aired because the report , which was written by @entity107 , a @entity25 employee who studied the organization 's inner workings for more than a year , was essentially buried by @entity25 commanders			0
in an internal memo to his staff , the @entity25 commander at the time , maj. gen. @entity112 , wrote on feb. 3 , 2012 , that his organization would ' not consider any allegations , findings or recommendations from the report , ' which he said would ' not be considered in future planning efforts ' aimed at improving operations			0
he ' disavowed ' the study and said it was ' rejected in its entirety			0
' @entity112 said some parts of the study were ' poorly written , reflect a bias and contain findings and recommendations that go beyond the intended scope of the report			0
' he demanded that it not be further shared or even copied			0
@entity20 was asked whether @entity25 's handling of the contentious report will be part of @entity85 's review			0
' this review has n't even been initiated , but it will be started shortly			0
and i would imagine that those and other questions will be asked as part of it , ' he said .			0
