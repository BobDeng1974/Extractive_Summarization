commandos will man up to ten rigid inflatable boats up and down the four - and - a - quarter - mile course			1
organisers have introduced the ‘ visible deterrent ’ to prevent any copycat of protester @entity16 who stopped the race when he jumped into the @entity20 and was almost hit by one of the @entity6 oars			1
police will monitor @entity24 for any signs of a planned disruption of the event			2
@entity2 go through security preparation on the @entity20 ahead of the @entity29 executive director of the @entity5 @entity31 said : ‘ we are taking additional measures this year and have reviewed all of our actions last year in detail			1
‘ there will be an increased presence both on and off the water , including support from the @entity2 , but as with any security plan i can not disclose the exact details			1
‘ what i would say to anybody thinking of disrupting the race is that it ’s unbelievably dangerous			2
you risk injuring yourself , the crews and the other people following the race			0
this is just a sporting event			0
’ however , organisers will not have to worry about @entity16 , 37 , making an appearance			0
he will spend the day walking in the @entity56			0
the @entity57 was released from prison in december after serving seven weeks of a six - month sentence for causing a public nuisance			1

spokesman @entity90 said : ‘ @entity6 are certainly the best backed crew as of yet , although that was very much the case at this stage of proceedings last year			2
‘ last year , however , we took nearly £ 40,000 on the day of the race and @entity97 became best backed by the time the race started			2
maybe history will repeat itself this time around			0
’ there have been calls for supporters to boycott the @entity97 team over claims that it plans to build a new boat house which will threaten wildlife			0

‘ i hope that the @entity97 boat sinks in sunday 's @entity29 , ’ he said			2
‘ why ? because the @entity121 is planning to build a new boathouse ( although it is far more than just a boathouse ) on one of the best sites for otters in @entity126 , and its impact on local wildlife will be severe			0
’ but @entity130 , the group working to provide the new facility , have stressed the boat house would be built sensitively to protect its natural surroundings , the paper reported .			0
