' i had heard of other stories of people doing similar things so i thought " why not " , ' he said			2
' i was not meeting anyone at bars and clubs			2
i had tried online and speed dating with mixed results and now i 'm bored of it			2
it 's also hard to meet people in general			1

' basically i like to take chances and just give things a go			0
hoping there 's a girl out there who has a similar outlook on life and also thinks " why not "			1
' so far @entity5 has received 60 emails from interested women from his poster but not one who ticks all the boxes			1
' some write just out of curiosity			0

some write on behalf of friends			0
some flake when it comes to meeting up , ' he said			0
' girls appear to be wary of the poster			0
it 's understandable but i also think of it as a bit of test			2
is she willing to take a chance like me ? those that do , stand out to me and am thankful for it			0
' and this is a method @entity5 has tried before			1
' did it late last year			2
