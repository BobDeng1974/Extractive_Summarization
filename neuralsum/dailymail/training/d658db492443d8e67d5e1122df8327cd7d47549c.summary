by @entity0 published : 12:17 est , 16 april 2013 updated : 14:54 est , 16 april 2013 eight - year - old @entity1 , with foster mother @entity2 , has become the first person to have her life - saving oxygen supply transported in her toy luggage an eight - year - old girl has become the first person to be given a life - saving oxygen supply in her toy luggage			1
@entity1 has had her @entity8 - a suitcase that can be ridden on or pulled along - specially modified to carry the life - saving cylinder			1
the eight - year - old suffers from cerebral palsy , pulmonary hypertension and chronic lung disease which means her blood quickly loses oxygen , threatening her with fatal brain damage			1
current mobile oxygen supplies were too big for her , which meant her mother @entity20 , 44 , or another adult had to carry it in a rucksack			1
but thanks to @entity2 and the charity @entity24 , which helps brain injured children and young people - @entity1 is as free as any other little girl to explore the world with her bright pink life - saving luggage in tow			1
ms @entity20 said : ' the @entity8 is bright pink and the other children do n't see it as something medical , it looks like a toy any of them would use			2
' @entity1 used to have to stay with an adult or with me at all times because we had the rucksack with oxygen in it , but now she 's free to explore on her own			0
' she can use it at school or out playing and when we go to hospital for an appointment , she 's off and in there before i 've got chance to get out of the car			0
' it 's the only one in the country like it			0
@entity24 have stabilised it and added a rigid handle instead of a strap , but apart from that , it looks just like a @entity8			0
' @entity1 was born premature at just 27 weeks and has had cerebral palsy since birth			2
she also suffers from weakness down her left side because of the condition			0
her foster mother added : ' without the oxygen @entity1 loses energy quickly , she becomes irritable and as her blood loses oxygen , it can lead to brain damage			1
' i wanted her to have the freedom of other girls , as [ having an oxygen tank at school ] was hard for her			2
' when i looked for mobile oxygen carriers , all there were only adult ones , they only had two wheels and were too big			2
' a solution came when @entity2 contacted the charity @entity24 , where staff came up with the idea to specially modify the popular child 's toy first seen on the tv show @entity89 @entity1 suffers from cerebral palsy and chronic lung disease which means her blood quickly loses oxygen , threatening her with fatal brain damage			1
current mobile oxygen supplies were too big for her hope : thanks to the charity @entity24 , @entity1 is as free as any other little girl to explore the world with her bright pink life - saving luggage in tow @entity1 's foster mother @entity2 said : ' she used to have to stay with an adult or with me at all times because we had the rucksack with oxygen in it , but now she 's free to explore on her own ' @entity109 , from @entity110 , said : ' we were working on design solutions to fulfil the brief set by @entity2 and struggling to achieve something we could make by hand and within budget that would enhance @entity1 's life and give her something to be proud of			1
' we then thought of @entity8 and tried to modify one for its new use			0
' @entity119 , the design team behind @entity8 were very supportive of our work and very kindly donated lots of their products for any future conversions we were able to dream up			0
' a product like this , which can give freedom and independence as well as enhance social inclusion , is a great thing			0
' this is really important and in our designs we work especially hard to give the children something to be proud of , something to help them say " yes i am different , and yes , i am amazing			0
