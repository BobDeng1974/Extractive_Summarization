by @entity0 the long days of summer might harm the chances of fatherhood , claim scientists , but drinking and smoking do n’t damage a man ’s sperm			1
a study produces surprising evidence that while more daylight may affect sperm quality , lifestyle factors long thought to have an effect , including obesity , make no difference			1
even wearing tight underwear did not have an effect , despite dire warnings previously that prospective dads should invest in boxer shorts			2
surprising : the study found that the seasons have an effect of sperm quality while other factors - such as alcohol and obesity - do not the only lifestyle choice that had a major impact was smoking cannabis , which can reduce a man ’s fertility by altering the size and shape of his sperm			1
a similar effect was discovered in the summer , although experts suggest it is n’t heat but probably the length of the day and hormonal changes that are responsible			2
when less than 4 per cent of a man ’s sperm has a normal size and shape , statistics show he will find it harder to father a child and may need help from fertility techniques , including @entity53			1
teams from the universities of @entity56 and @entity57 carried out the world ’s largest study on the effects of lifestyle on sperm			1
using data from 2,249 men attending fertility clinics around the @entity67 , they compared the medical history and personal habits of 318 participants with less than 4 per cent of normal sperm and 1,652 whose sperm was of higher quality			1
men in the first group were nearly twice as likely to have used cannabis in the three months before giving a sample , if they were aged under 30			0
they were also nearly twice as likely to have produced the sample in the summer months			0
the scientists believe younger men were most affected by cannabis simply because they were more likely to use greater quantities			2
chemicals in the drug itself , not the tobacco used in ‘ joints ’ , were probably responsible since cigarette smoking had little effect on sperm			1
one of the team leaders , dr @entity92 , senior lecturer in andrology – the study of male health – at @entity56 , said habitual cannabis users who wanted to become fathers should kick the habit for at least three months			1
‘ i ca n’t tell you definitively that your sperm will improve , but that ’s a reasonable assumption , ’ he said			2
he said the summer influence was surprising but it did not appear to be linked to heat or significantly alter seasonal conception patterns			0
‘ we did n’t expect this , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s complete conjecture on my part , but it could be a sunlight effect			2
day - length affects our hormones and vitamin d in all sorts of ways			0
’ he added that men wanting to be fathers should not wait until winter			0
however , the study , published in the journal @entity120 , found that abstaining from sexual activity for more than six days improved sperm quality			1
it was possible that unmeasured factors , such as the quality of sperm dna , influenced the results , said the researchers			1
one of the key findings of the study is that men wanting to have children should quit taking cannabis			2
the drug doubles the risk of men under 30 producing abnormal sperm - something that can have a serious impact on their fertility			0
cut it out : men wanting to have children should quit cannabis as it can have an impact on the size and shape of their sperm , potentially reducing fertility dr @entity92 said : ' if you are a man trying for a baby then the sensible thing to do is to stop smoking joints but the effect wo n’t be seen overnight			1
' ' it takes three months to produce sperm so you ca n’t stop smoking cannabis on friday and expect to see an improvement on monday			1
you ’ve got to stop in june to see an improvement in august , ' he added			0
the exact reason cannabis has an impact on sperm production was not established , but dr @entity92 says the connection ' jumped out of the analysis			0
' ' i think it ’s a real effect , and it ’s not been shown before in such a robust way , ' he said			0
' the fact that we see this in younger men suggests that we are seeing a dose effect			0
younger men may be more inclined to smoke cannabis more frequently and in higher doses than older men , ' he went on to say .			0

@entity181 *'s* largest study on the effects of lifestyle on sperm has been published
researchers found link between sperm quality and the time of year
but the scientists from @entity56 and @entity57 *debunked* some *theories*
they found factors including alcohol , smoking and obesity had no effect
