an orphaned black boy , growing up in @entity1 , becomes a hero on the football pitch for @entity4 , despite suffering abuse from the terraces			1
then he goes on to become the first black officer in the @entity8 , mentioned in dispatches and recommended for the @entity10 for heroism in the @entity12			1
it ought to be the most inspiring story			0
but at the same time , it is one of the most heartbreaking			0
because at 29 second lieutenant @entity17 was killed in action in @entity19 , and due to the colour of his skin he was never officially recognised for his gallantry			1
and although he died a hero ’s death in 1918 , to this day no one knows where his body lies : his name is among the 30,000 soldiers with no known grave , remembered on the war memorial at @entity31			1
role model : @entity17 , pictured in his @entity4 kit during his football days , broke barriers but now , with the help of @entity39 author @entity38 , there is a chance that these omissions will be rectified			1
@entity38 says his latest novel was inspired by @entity17 ’s story , and has called for him to be officially recognised with a posthumous medal and a statue outside the @entity46 in @entity47			1
such honours would be a far cry from @entity51 ’s humble origins			0
his father , @entity52 , the son of slaves , came to @entity54 from @entity55 to work as a carpenter , settling in @entity57 and marrying a local woman			0
@entity17 was born in @entity59 in 1888			1
but by 1897 both @entity17 ’s parents had died and @entity17 and his brother @entity61 were moved to a children ’s home in @entity47 ’s @entity64			1
@entity61 was quickly adopted , leaving @entity17 alone			1
every morning before lessons he would have to wash in freezing cold water , clean at least 15 pairs of boots and scrub floors on his knees			0
war hero : @entity17 with fellow officers after being promoted to second lieutenant in 1917 , a year before he died in battle at the age of 29 then he started playing football and was soon signed by local team @entity77 , who promptly won every cup available to them in 1908			1
next season he was taken on as an inside forward by @entity4 for a transfer fee of £ 10			2
he was paid £ 4 a week , the top wage at the time			2
he became the first black outfield player at a @entity87 club			2
the only black professional footballer in @entity54 before him was goalkeeper @entity89			2
but , at a time when there were very few black faces in @entity54 , @entity17 was to endure racial abuse from the terraces			1
in october 1909 , after a match against @entity97 , a reporter wrote of the @entity97 fans : ‘ they made a cowardly attack upon him in language lower than @entity102			0
@entity103 is so clean in mind and method as to be a model for all white men			0
’ however , @entity17 was soon dropped from the @entity4 first team , never to regain a regular spot			1
when war was declared in 1914 , he volunteered and joined the @entity112 17th @entity111			0
he was promoted three times during training and was sent to @entity19 , close to the front line			2
in 1916 , despite having suffered severely from shell shock , he fought so courageously on the @entity117 that his commanding officers recommended promotion , and in 1917 he was made a second lieutenant			1
after leading a raiding party across enemy lines on the @entity123 in the harsh winter of 1917 - 18 , he was put forward for the @entity10 for his outstanding bravery and leadership and was mentioned in dispatches for his ‘ gallantry and coolness ’ under fire			0
in memoriam : @entity17 is remembered among 30,000 other soldiers with no grave at @entity31 , @entity19 but two months later , while crossing @entity134 on the @entity135 in @entity19 , he was shot and killed			2
the fighting was so severe that his body was never recovered			0
in those days , @entity8 officers had to be ‘ of pure @entity140 descent ’			2
by making him an officer , @entity17 ’s superiors had thrown away the rule book			1
but after the war , the colour of his skin meant he was never awarded his @entity10			1
now , the campaign to reverse this decision is gathering steam			0
as well as @entity38 ’s efforts , @entity152 mp @entity151 is supporting an online number 10 petition calling for @entity51 to be posthumously awarded the medal			0
@entity151 , @entity156 mp for @entity157 , also says @entity17 ’s departure from @entity4 was more about the racism @entity17 encountered than football : ‘ i believe @entity4 were embarrassed by what happened and wanted to get rid of him			1
’ the mp says his fight has recently hit a ‘ brick wall ’ at the @entity164 : ‘ they gave me the excuse that a soldier could n’t be awarded a @entity10 posthumously in those days			0
i found one who had but they were n’t interested			0
’ the campaign has coincided with a new book for children : @entity17 ’s scrapbook by @entity174 , and on thursday a play , simply called @entity51 , opened at @entity177 ’s @entity176			2
the @entity179 novel inspired by @entity51 is a medal for @entity181			0
aimed at children , it is dedicated to @entity17 ’s memory and tells of a boy finding out about his black @entity187 pilot father , who died in the war			1
@entity38 says he wants a @entity51 statue in @entity47 ‘ so the children of today , black and white , can see how long and how honourably black people have been serving in the @entity192			0
i simply felt more people should know about this remarkable man ’			0
@entity17 ’s @entity173 , by @entity174 , is published by @entity195 for £ 11.99			2
for your copy at £ 9.99 inc p&p , call the @entity198 on 0844 472 4157 or go to mailbookshop.co.uk .			0
