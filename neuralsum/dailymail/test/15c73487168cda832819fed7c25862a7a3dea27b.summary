@entity0 insists @entity2 's goals have dried up due to their @entity4 rivals giving them more respect			1
saints have slipped out of the @entity8 places and into seventh following a run of three defeats in their last six games ahead of saturday 's home clash with @entity14			2
@entity0 blames the slump on a lack of goals but rather than looking to his strikers for fault , he believes a change in approach from opponents has been the telling factor			1
@entity0 feels @entity2 have found it hard to score due to opponents respecting them more @entity2 striker @entity27 ( centre ) has struggled to reproduce his form from the start of the season @entity27 ( left ) is tackled by @entity32 in @entity2 's 1 - 0 defeat by @entity34 at @entity35 ' it 's not in my opinion a problem about one player - just look at the last few games , ' @entity0 said			1
' even when we play away - for example last weekend against @entity34 - teams do n't care about playing football at home , they defend			2
that is different to the beginning of the season			0
' now opponents do n't care how they play against @entity2 , they 're happy to defend and they 're concerned about getting points			1
at this point of the season , points are more important for them			0
' we are not always scoring lots of goals and that 's the difference			2
we are not getting the space we had in the beginning			0
' it makes it more difficult because then there is not really a lot of space			0
@entity68 played with three centre - backs but with five defenders against @entity2 , and @entity14 normally play with five defenders			1
' that means there is not a lot of space , so you have to play very well or you need a player who makes an individual action and scores a goal			0
' but those types of individual , high - quality players are not playing for @entity2			1
' @entity0 remains upbeat and is targeting @entity84 qualification with @entity2 this season @entity0 believes @entity2 's @entity8 dream is over , but still covets a place in the @entity87			1
' you have to be realistic			0
the difference to the top four is eight points and that is a lot			2
the focus at the moment has to be about fifth , sixth and seventh position in the table , ' he sad			0
' we would like to play @entity84 football and fifth and sixth positions mean @entity84 football			0

@entity2 have *dropped* out of the @entity4 top six
@entity0 has *pinpointed* his team 's struggle to hit the net
he feels the problem is down to opponents having more respect for @entity2
