social workers seized a man aged 91 from his house and imprisoned him in a care home against his will for 17 months , a judge said yesterday			1
staging an early morning raid , they took the former civil servant away from his home of 50 years in his dressing gown			1
they claimed they were taking him to a hotel – and threatened to call police when he refused			0
judge @entity16 ruled that @entity17 acted illegally when he removed the pensioner from his home and moved him into a care home for dementia sufferers in may 2013 , charging him £ 25,000 in fees he was then locked up in a care home , subjected to ‘ continuous supervision and control ’ , and forbidden from seeing his friends or attend services at his church , the court heard			1
but for a friend ’s protests , he could have been imprisoned for life , district judge @entity16 said , condemning @entity17 and its social workers , who repeatedly refused to accept independent expert reports that found he was fit to live at home			1
they ignored the elderly man ’s consistent pleas to go back to his house and his cat , @entity41			2
not until the day of the final court hearing in the case did they change their minds			0
judge @entity16 said the treatment of the former @entity49 gunner was ‘ inexcusable ’ and ‘ disturbing ’			1
he found the man was unlawfully detained and awarded him £ 150,000 , together with free care at home for the rest of his life			1
the case is one of hundreds now going through the secretive @entity57 to challenge imprisonment of vulnerable people by councils using the controversial @entity61			2
the man was not identified , and nor were the social workers , despite senior judges saying that the courts should name social workers just as they name police officers or medical experts			2
in his ruling , judge @entity16 said the man lived in his home for 50 years , first with his parents and his sister , and since their deaths alone with his cat			1
he went to church every sunday and had a group of friends , who described him as generous towards those in need and charities			0
after he developed dementia and health problems , his friends told the council he could be vulnerable			2
a social worker visited , but her report said nothing about his mental state or his wishes			0
judge @entity16 ruled that the council should pay the man £ 60,000 , waive the fees and cover his legal costs instead , she and a colleague returned at 8.30am the next day			1
the man ‘ was wearing his dressing gown and was without trousers or pyjama bottoms ’			0
the court heard that the social worker insisted he go with her to a ‘ hotel ’ – really the care home			1
when he refused , she told him she would call police			0
he was ‘ very reluctant to leave ’ and ‘ very distressed ’			0
the social workers had no legal authority for this , the judge said , adding : ‘ he was detained against his wishes for 17 months			1
’ social workers next applied for legal control of the man ’s finances , at a time when his care fees were £ 1,500 a month			1
a friend complained , and was told to take her case to the @entity57			2
as a result , the man was finally allowed home last november			1
the judge said : ‘ i fail to understand why [ this ] was considered to be a reasonable and proportionate solution to the problem			0
‘ it is hard to imagine a more depressing and inexcusable state of affairs			0
had it not been for the alarm raised by his friend , he may have been condemned to remain there for the remainder of his days			0
’ he said the social workers were ‘ unprepared to countenance any view contrary to their own ’			0
‘ they maintained their resolute opposition to his returning to his home until the last possible moment			0
the conduct of @entity17 has been reprehensible			2
the very sad and disturbing consequences for him can not be ignored , ’ he added .			0
