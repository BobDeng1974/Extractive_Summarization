glowing tributes were paid yesterday to cricketing legend @entity1 , after his death at 84 from skin cancer			1
at @entity4 , @entity6 flags were lowered , and the @entity8 government offered a state funeral for the man who never lost a @entity12 series as his country ’s captain , then became a commentator			1
@entity16 said he had ‘ grown up listening to @entity1 ’s wonderful cricket commentary ’ , while his @entity8 counterpart @entity18 called it ‘ a sad day for @entity20 ’			1
retiring as a player in 1964 , @entity1 ’s masterful analysis was universally revered			1
here , we reproduce a tribute paid by the @entity26 ’s brilliant sports columnist @entity25 — which he wrote in 2005 after coverage of live international cricket in @entity30 switched from terrestrial to satellite tv , depriving cricket fans of @entity1 ’s voice			1
@entity1 in the commentary box at the @entity36 for the final test of the 2005 ashes			1
thereafter international cricket fans in @entity30 lost his genius when live game switched from terrestrial to satellite tv so it is farewell , then , to the master of @entity47			1
@entity1 will not be returning to @entity30 next summer to sustain his pre-eminence as cricket ’s finest commentator			1
that is not merely my judgment			1
a recent poll by @entity56 magazine attracted an astonishing 12,000 votes			2
precisely 10,128 of them nominated @entity1 as the best			2
fortunately , he does not leave us without a word or several of advice to those who seek to emulate his success , particularly retired players whose agents deem them instantly equipped to pick up a microphone and irritate us with an effluent of @entity70 verbiage			2
he does so in a valedictory book which is an encyclopaedia of broadcasting wisdom			2
he is too polite for that			2
nor is there a hint of the tetchiness that occasionally afflicts icons in their pensionable years			2
at 74 , @entity1 is still as fit as a flea , the result of a lifestyle as measured as his commentating			2
yes , there are rare occasions when he will let down his hair with the rest of us , but when serious business is afoot he will rise from an increasingly raucous dinner party , check his watch that it is exactly 10pm and announce : ‘ thank you very much			2
’ at sunrise next morning , he and @entity92 , his elegant and unfailingly supportive @entity94 wife , will be striding out on their three - mile constitutional			2
@entity1 representing @entity20 in 1961			2
he led his country as captain in 28 of his 63 tests and never lost a series he is meticulous in all things			1
on tv commentary days , even @entity92 is not allowed to iron his shirts			0
he is a food faddist , preparing his @entity12 lunch boxes at home to be certain of what he is eating			0
once , he took a week - long course in @entity110 to learn how to cook pasta to perfection			0
his desks at his homes in @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117 are polished plateaux of precision , his reference - book shelves indexed for instant reach			0
it is this unrelenting self - discipline , instilled by a schoolmaster and great club cricketer father and a lovely mother — there is a gorgeous picture of her celebrating her 100th birthday with @entity1 and his @entity12 brother @entity130 in the book — that launched him into his dual career life			1
the first , of course , was in cricket , where to haul oneself from school , to club , to @entity138 , the @entity8 team and then its captaincy was a classic climb			1
@entity1 led his country in 28 of his 63 tests and never lost a series			1
such was his cunning as a wrist - spinner that his batsmanship was often overlooked			0
in fact , he became the first , in an era when far fewer tests were played , to scale the double of 200 wickets and 2,000 runs			1
but what next ? all of seven years before he retired from cricket , @entity1 wondered if there could be a distant future in the communication industry			1
there was little doubt about that since he had been a young crime reporter on a @entity117 newspaper , where sub-editors ruthlessly deleted from his copy any flowery phrases which he thought rather good but were irrelevant to the story			0
it was an important lesson			0
then a curious opportunity , which could n’t happen in today ’s schedules , presented itself			0
at the end of @entity20 ’s 1956 tour to @entity30 , all their players were given three weeks off to enjoy such fleshpots of relaxation as they could discover in the @entity175			1
@entity8 captain @entity1 takes on the @entity6 in the first innings at @entity177 on december 5 , 1958 @entity1 proceeded otherwise			0
at his own expense he moved from the @entity179 into a cramped lower ground room in the @entity182 club in @entity183 and took a @entity185 television training course , alongside directors , commentators , even audiences , to learn how television worked			0
he trailed @entity188 at @entity189 and he studied the commentating techniques of @entity191 on golf and @entity193 on tennis			0
all three had their idiosyncrasies , but one thing they had in common			0
@entity188 , voice rising to overdrive at the climax of a horse race , was circumspect about collateral chatter , just as @entity191 and ‘ oh i say ’ @entity193 knew the value of golden silence			1
indeed , one of @entity191 ’s silences was so long that his director asked over the private intercom : ‘ excuse me , @entity1 , but are you still alive ? ’ @entity1 now says : ‘ i did n’t know if i had a future in broadcasting			0
if i had n’t done that @entity185 course my life would have been very different , even though i had to wait for seven years for my chance			0
‘ the key feature it taught me was the economy of words			0
never insult the viewers by telling them what they have seen perfectly clearly themselves			1
only add to it if you had something pertinent to say			0
’ @entity1 rings the bell on the pavilion balcony on the second day of the second test between @entity30 and @entity20 at @entity4 during the 2009 ashes these days if only			1
has he ever made a bloomer ? of course , like all of us , he has			1
on one celebrated occasion , handing over from a test match for a news update from @entity229 , he called her @entity231 , the celebrated ballerina who had starred in an acclaimed film			0
when @entity229 handed back he said : ‘ thanks , @entity229 , our newsreader wearing @entity233			0
’ many , who had not heard his initial blunder , wondered what on earth he was on about			0
‘ at the time , ’ he recalls , ‘ i thought it was a pretty clever remark , but many tuning in at that moment had no idea what it meant			0
it taught me never to be such a smart - arse again			0
’ laconic , economic , massively instructive and with a dry impartial wit about whoever is getting the upper hand in a test match , i wonder if we shall ever hear his like again on television ? many are called and surprisingly many are given the opportunity behind the microphone			0
very few have served the slogging apprenticeship that makes a master cricket commentator .			1

international cricket fans in @entity30 lost legend **'s** voice after 2005 ashes
this led @entity25 to pay homage to ' cricket **'s** finest commentator '
as a player he led his country in 28 of his 63 tests and never lost a series
mantra of ' never insulting the viewers ' by saying too much made him great
