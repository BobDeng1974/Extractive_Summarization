by @entity0 published : 09:40 est , 13 january 2014 updated : 19:49 est , 13 january 2014 nine women in @entity3 have received womb transplants and will soon try to conceive			1
@entity5 ( pictured ) , from @entity6 , had a transplant in august 2011 and subsequently conceived but she miscarried after eight weeks of pregnancy the first baby from a donor womb could be born next year after nine childless women received transplants			1
the women , who were born without a womb or had it removed due to cancer , received organs donated by close relatives			1
they will soon try to become pregnant through @entity19 in a pioneering trial in @entity3 that gives hope to thousands of childless women in the @entity23			1
the new wombs , taken from a mother or other living relative who has completed her family , will not only allow the women to experience the joys of pregnancy but will mean they have babies that are genetically their own			1
those whose mother was the donor will be using the womb that carried them for nine months to carry their baby			2
the groundbreaking transplants bring hope to at least 15,000 @entity43 women of childbearing age			2
however , the method is controversial because it involves taking wombs from living donors			2
the @entity3 team favours it because the organs are generally in better condition and a better immunological match			0
other surgeons in the same field do not believe it is right to put a living donor through such a major operation when it is not life - saving			2
they say the best option is to use an organ from a dead donor			0
this allows them to transplant extra tissue and the major blood vessels needed to take the strain of pregnancy			0
dr @entity67 , of the @entity68 , who spent more than a decade perfecting the complex surgical techniques needed , said : ‘ this is a new kind of surgery			0
’ he added that the women who received new wombs are doing well and will soon try to become pregnant using @entity19 – but there are no guarantees of success			1
the @entity3 women all received wombs donated by living female relatives			1
image shows the @entity68 team practising how to carry out the operations @entity83 , head of @entity23 , says the charity is ready to give five @entity43 women wombs from dead donors , subject to receiving ethical clearance and raising the £ 500,000 required to cover the cost of surgery			0
‘ we are good to go , save for the fact we have n’t got any money , ’ he said			0
mr @entity83 , a consultant gynaecological surgeon , described the @entity3 breakthrough as ‘ amazing ’ and said a successful birth would bolster similar projects around the world			0
any babies the @entity3 women bear are likely to be delivered by caesarean section and the new wombs will be removed after only one or two pregnancies			2
the women are on powerful immunosuppressant drugs but the biggest worry is how well a transplanted womb will cope with the strains of pregnancy , during which the womb swells from the size of a pear to that of a melon			2
critics question the process , with fertility expert @entity115 saying the risks are too great and some women should accept that they will never bear children			0
the women will not be able to conceive naturally as their wombs are not connected to their fallopian tubes			1
they will have @entity19 treatment to allow them to become pregnant with embryos they previously had frozen those in favour say it is the only way for some women to fulfil their deep - seated yearning to have a baby			1
experts say the operations will only be considered a success on the birth of a healthy baby			0
dr @entity136 , medical director of the @entity137 at @entity138 ’s and @entity139 in @entity140 , said : ‘ what remains to be seen is whether this is a viable option or if this is going to be confined to research and limited experimentation			0
’ the world ’s first womb transplant took place in @entity149 in 2000			1
however , the woman ’s body rejected the donated organ after four months			0
@entity6 doctors performed a successful transplant in 2011 , but patient @entity5 lost her baby during pregnancy last year			1
the womb recipients all had their transplants after either being born without a womb or having it removed because of cervical cancer			1
picture shows the @entity3 surgical team practising the transplant operation			0

the women were either born without a womb or had theirs removed because of cervical cancer - they received the transplants from living relatives
they will now have @entity19 treatment to implant embryos into their wombs
they are not able to conceive naturally as the wombs were not connected to their fallopian tubes - but they have previously had embryos frozen
previous attempts to transplant a womb - one in @entity149 and one in @entity6 - both failed to *produce* a baby but the @entity6 woman did conceive
she later had a miscarriage after two months of pregnancy
