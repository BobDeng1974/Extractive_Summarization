by @entity0 the captain of the @entity3 ferry that capsized three days ago with hundreds of schoolchildren aboard today defended his decision to delay its evacuation			1
police charged @entity9 and two of his crew early in the morning			1
all three have been criticised for leaving behind hundreds of passengers , while abandoning ship themselves			1
but @entity9 insisted he feared the outcome could have been worse if he had given the order to man the lifeboats too early			1
' at the time a rescue ship had not arrived , ' he said			1
' there were also no fishing boats around for rescues , or other ships to help			1
' the currents were very strong and the water was cold at that time in the area			1
i thought that passengers would be swept far away and fall into trouble if they evacuated thoughtlessly			1
@entity9 has been charged under maritime law with negligence and failing to secure the safety of passengers			1
thirty - two have been confirmed dead so far , and a further 273 are still missing			1
most of them are schoolchildren who were on a high school holiday trip			1
as the arrests were being made , dive teams who had spent two days vainly battling powerful currents and near zero visibility , finally made it to the passenger decks of the 6,825 - tonne @entity32			1
' civilian divers spotted three bodies through a window , ' a senior coastguard officer said			2
' they attempted to get in and retrieve them by cracking the window , but it was too difficult , ' he said in a briefing to relatives of the missing			1
low visibility : relatives of the missing passengers , who have been sleeping in a gymnasium on @entity76 near the scene of the disaster , were shown video footage from one dive even with a powerful underwater flashlight , visibility was measured in inches as the diver was seen groping his way blindly along the side of the ship with the help of a pre-attached rope relatives of those missing in the disaster watch footage of the dive relayed on to big screens in the gymnasium where they have been staying as they await news of their loved ones relatives of the missing passengers , who have been sleeping in a gymnasium on @entity76 near the scene of the disaster , were shown video footage from one dive			1
even with a powerful underwater flashlight , visibility was measured in inches as the diver was seen groping his way blindly along the side of the ship with the help of a pre-attached rope			2
captain @entity9 was arraigned this morning along with the two officers in charge of the bridge at the time			1
dressed in dark raincoats with their hoods pulled up , the three kept their heads bowed as they were paraded before tv cameras in a police station			1
experts have suggested many more people might have escaped if they had moved to reach evacuation points before the ship listed sharply and water started flooding in			1
the relatives camped out in the @entity76 gym - most of the them parents of high school students - have sharply criticised the pace of the rescue operation , accusing officials of incompetence and indifference			1
only 174 were rescued when the ferry sank and no new survivors have been found since wednesday			2
@entity139 , whose 17 - year - old nephew was among the missing , said the clock was fast running down on the hope that some may have survived			1
' we do n't have much time			2
many people here believe this is the last possible day for finding trapped passengers alive , ' said mr @entity139			1
' after today , hope will be gone			2
' rescue team boats sail around buoys which were installed to mark the area of the sunken ferry as they search for passengers believed trapped in the @entity32 @entity3 frogmen talk at each other as they search for passengers from the sunken ferry : teams who had spent two days vainly battling powerful currents and near zero visibility , finally made it to the passenger decks today for those relatives ready to accept the worst outcome , the coastguard had set up a tent near the gym to take dna tests to facilitate eventual identification of recovered bodies			1
standing in the queue to give a sample was @entity177 , whose teenage son is listed as missing in the disaster			1
she told @entity181 : ' up until yesterday , i was still hanging on to some hope			2
but today i 'm bracing myself for the worst			2
' more than 350 of those on board were students from @entity188 's @entity187 in @entity190 city just south of @entity39			2
the unfolding tragedy was compounded by the apparent suicide yesterday of the school 's vice principal , @entity195 , who was seemingly overcome by guilt at having organised the trip , and surviving the sinking			2
it is understood that a note was found in his pocket which read : ' surviving alone is too painful while 200 remain unaccounted for			2
i pushed ahead with the school trip			2
' i will once again become a teacher in the afterlife for my students whose bodies have not been discovered			2
' @entity3 's @entity209 has released a transcript of the conversation between @entity212 ( @entity213 ) on @entity214 and the @entity32 , the ferry that sank on wednesday			2
originally in @entity3 , the transcript has been translated by @entity217			2

grief : the relative of a missing passenger who was on the @entity32 sits by the water at the port of @entity76 and cries as she waits for news from the rescue team initial questioning of the captain has focused on what actually caused the ferry to sink			1
tracking data from the @entity288 showed the vessel made a sharp turn just before sending its first distress signal			0
some experts believe a tight turn could have dislodged the heavy cargo manifest - including more than 150 vehicles - and destabilised the vessel , causing it to list heavily and then capsize			1
captain @entity9 confirmed he was not at the helm when the ship ran into trouble			1
the ship was being steered by a 55 - year - old helmsman identified by his surname @entity304 , under the supervision of the female third officer			1
reports suggested it was the first time that the sailor had navigated those waters			0
' it may have partly been my fault , ' @entity304 said at the arraignment			0
' but the steering gear rotated unusually fast			0
' three giant , floating cranes are now at the rescue site , but coastguard officials stressed they would not begin lifting the multi-deck ferry until they were sure there were no survivors inside .			0
