@entity1 ’s backpack is sagging under the weight of @entity3 and several other hefty tomes but she bounces up the grand stone staircase at @entity7 , passing a pair of marble statues of the @entity11 dramatist @entity10 and philosopher @entity12			1
the 19 - year - old remarks excitedly that she chose to study here partly because of the air of consequence in the hallways			1
the history undergraduate had her pick of universities			2
a number of establishments tried to woo her to study in the @entity24 because , as well as being a brilliant young academic , @entity25 is @entity28 ’s fastest woman and one of the world ’s top sprinting talents			1
@entity1 has been juggling her studies with her athletics - both of which she is excelling in winning 100 metre gold at the @entity38 in @entity39 this summer by the biggest margin for 14 years alerted hundreds of university recruiters on the other side of the pond , where sporting prowess is prized above all			1
@entity25 was flattered but chose to remain at her training base in @entity48 , south @entity49			1
‘ @entity51 and @entity52 showed interest , ’ she says			2
‘ you get messages and emails from quite a lot of places			2
' but i want to do athletics and academics at a high standard and it ’s hard to match up the two			2
at @entity51 , athletics training might not be as high a standard as @entity52 , where it ’s not as good for studies			2
’ we are talking in the staff room of the @entity71 campus building after a morning of lectures and before she heads home to write an essay ahead of training at @entity77 and @entity78			2
@entity79 ( left ) celebrates winning the @entity38 in july and the 19 - year - old ( right ) pictured at a @entity82 event in october @entity79 is all smiles as she speaks to @entity85 about her ambitions on and off the track ‘ today i did the @entity88 , ’ she says , ‘ i do medieval history , early modern @entity90 and the @entity91			1
i like early modern history best , learning about the ideas of enlightenment and renaissance			2
‘ the volume of work is insane			0
i ’m here three days a week and we have 200 pages of reading to do for each day			0
then i have six training sessions a week			0
‘ i ’m always quite tired , but i knew i had to be a bit more organised than most students			0
you ca n’t really afford to just sit there and sleep			0
' i ’m paying £ 9,000 a year to be here so i ca n’t go to a seminar without doing my reading			1
even if i do n’t say much i want to know what they ’re talking about			0
’ in one incredible day in august , @entity25 learned she had achieved the results required to get into @entity114 ’s , a minimum of three as at @entity117 — she modestly refuses to reveal the exact results because she does n’t want to look ‘ big headed ’			1
she also set a new @entity91 junior 200m record of 22.61sec to get to the final at the @entity122 in @entity123			0
@entity79 waves to the crowd at the medal 's ceremony for the women 's 100m at the @entity129 earlier this year her season ended abruptly as she broke down with a hamstring tear coming round the corner in the 200m final , but there was little wallowing time			1
‘ i could n’t shed a tear because it was the day after results , i had modules to pick , ’ she says			0
‘ if i ’d just had athletics i might have been despairing			0
‘ having two focuses you because it puts everything into perspective			0
@entity143 is great but we are entertainers and the industry is fleeting			0
' you might be at the top of the country right now , but next year you could be injured or not performing			2
you ’ve got something else to ground you and give you another possibility in life			0
’ @entity79 ’s coach @entity151 , who claims she would have broken the junior 200m record again in the final but for her injury , has known @entity25 since she was eight			1
he is happy she has decided to go to university but claims it can take athletes 18 months to get back on track			2
' @entity1 has reduced the potential obstacles by choosing to live at home so there wo n’t be the issue of diet changing			1
but there are small things like maybe she used to walk to school and now she does n’t			0
@entity79 ( left ) beams after competing in the women 's 200 metres at the @entity170 in august , and ( right ) holds some of her study material while at @entity7 ‘ but this mix is definitely right for @entity1			1
she ’s very intelligent and needs to be exercising her brain to have that outlet			0
' not to denigrate anyone else , but it ’s helpful to have an intelligent athlete because they understand the reasons behind you doing certain things in training			0
’ now in the thick of winter training , @entity25 has recovered from her hamstring injury and is ‘ moving really fast ’ , according to @entity151			1
her 100m personal best of 11.14sec achieved earlier this year puts her fourth on the @entity91 all - time list , behind @entity188 , @entity189 and @entity190			1
@entity79 flies the @entity28 flag high on day two of the @entity38 with plenty of improvement still to be made , there are many who believe she could be @entity28 ’s next big athletics star , including @entity196 , the company which looks after @entity198 and @entity199 , who rushed to add @entity79 to their books			1
no longer a junior , @entity79 will focus on the @entity203 and senior championships next season , including the @entity204 in @entity205			1
the @entity206 in 2016 is also on the horizon			0
‘ i set the bar quite high for myself but what other people think and expect goes straight in one ear and out of the other , not to be rude , ’ she says , ‘ i ’m not the same as ( @entity188 or @entity189 )			0
i might achieve the same or i might do more			0
’ as she leaves to catch the bus , @entity25 strolls by the faces of notable alumni , including @entity220 champion rower @entity219 , printed on the side of the university building			1
you would not bet against @entity25 herself being up there one day .			1

@entity1 is currently @entity28 's fastest women
the 19 - year - old won 100 metre gold at the @entity38 in @entity39 this summer by the biggest margin for 14 years
off the track she is also a hit as she studies history at @entity237
@entity79 pays 9,000 a year to study at the illustrious @entity49 *college*
@entity25 turned down a number of establishments to study in the @entity24 , to get the best of both worlds in the @entity245
