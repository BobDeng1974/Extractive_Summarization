at the start of the season there were question marks over @entity4 and when @entity5 asked him to play slightly deeper in the @entity7 midfield people wondered whether he would be up to the mark			1
from what we 've seen so far , he 's making us re-evaluate him as player			2
let 's be clear that it 's very early days and his real tests in what is a very demanding position are yet to come			2
but from what we 've seen so far , he has every right to be encouraged by the way he has adapted to the role			1
@entity4 is showing skills and facets of his game which we have n't seen before			1
it 's actually making him a better player			0
i 've always thought that he needed to play the ball earlier and quicker than he sometimes has done with @entity29 ; playing in this role , he is forced to do exactly that			1
@entity7 midfielder @entity4 ( right ) slides in to make a tackle on @entity34 's @entity33 @entity35 has him down as a box - to - box midfielder and we typically think of him bursting down the pitch			1
but he 's looking for the early pass now			0
he has to look forward quicker , is releasing the ball earlier and is hitting passes over the back of people			0
he 's now looking for @entity44 and they are developing a bit of a relationship			0
@entity44 now knows if he makes good movement , @entity4 will pick him out			1
i thought @entity4 was @entity7 's best player on saturday , though the real test of whether he is up to playing in that position will be when we are up against better teams and he is playing against a top quality no 10			1
at the moment , in this @entity57 qualifying group , @entity7 will enjoy a lot of possession , which means @entity4 gets to see a lot of the ball			1
it 's an ideal scenario to learn the role			2
we need to wait to see how he does when we 're defending for long periods against top quality teams			0
against @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 or @entity71 we 're not going to dominate possession			0
then his defensive skills and movement will be tested and that will be a challenge			0
but for now , i 've been very impressed			0
@entity4 ( above ) can spend too much time on the ball when playing for @entity29 @entity4 does n't back down during an argument with @entity34 's @entity82 at @entity83 on saturday obviously , as a whole , @entity7 's performance started slowly and ended well			1
there was a real lack of movement in the first half and no spark at all			0
it was all very methodical			0
@entity7 had plenty of ball possession but did n't create nearly enough			1
clearly something would have been said at half - time to change that			2
maybe not stern words , but @entity5 and his team got the message across , even if @entity34 scored first through @entity100 's own goal			1
there was more intensity to @entity7 's game throughout the second half			1
@entity44 was good , if not brilliant , on the occasion of his 100th cap			0
you could n't really have asked much more from a captain than the manner in which he took the game to @entity34 in the immediate aftermath of @entity7 conceding			1
@entity29 midfielder @entity4 tries to get away from from @entity34 players after being surrounded his character was evident as he collected the ball and got into them and then his skill and movement was excellent to win the penalty			1
scoring it capped a great day for him			0
@entity123 did ok but needs to get closer to club form and though @entity125 is not back to his form of last season , he was part of the reason why we got stronger in the game			0
he was bogged down in the first half but the move to put him out wide right in the second and to stretch the game a little gave us a lot more width and helped simplify his game			0
overall , it 's difficult to assess the future using these games as a barometer of @entity7 's form			1
tournament football will be very different to the qualification phase and @entity7 wo n't be allowed nearly as much possession			2
they will have to use the friendlies much more as a test of how they 're improving and perhaps the @entity152 game — if we can call any game against @entity152 a friendly — is useful in that regard			0
@entity123 needs to get close to club form when playing for the @entity7 side @entity4 , pictured applauding @entity7 's support at @entity83 , is adapting to his defensive role in midfield maybe @entity5 will rest a few players , maybe @entity161 will get a run but , overall , the game comes at a good time			1
@entity152 wo n't want to sit back at home against @entity7 as most of their opponents do			2
the game will have passion , intensity and the defence will be stretched a lot more			0
on saturday evening ended up positively with @entity7 on the front foot			2
but tuesday night will be a step into the unknown for some of these young players			0
@entity5 will learn a little bit more about his team at @entity180 and perhaps that will begin to give us a real idea as to whether they have moved on from the @entity185			2
@entity186 midfielder @entity161 will be hoping to get a run out against @entity152 on tuesday			2

@entity7 beat @entity34 3 - 1 at @entity83 in their @entity57 qualifier
@entity4 was *deployed* at the base of a *diamond* by @entity5
the @entity29 midfielder has adapted well to his role with the @entity7
