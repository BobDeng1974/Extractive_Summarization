by @entity0 anonymity app secret has made waves since it emerged from @entity3 two months ago			2
the app showcases startling confessions about what a person really thinks but is n’t willing to share on sites like @entity9 and @entity10			1
now @entity10 's founder @entity11 could be about to cash in on the trend by reportedly launching a @entity14 - like app of his own			1
mystery meeting : @entity10 's @entity11 has contacted the @entity14 app founders about the idea , according to sources speaking to re / code 's @entity19 @entity11 has even contacted @entity14 about the idea , according re / code 's @entity19 , although he believes this was an acquisition talk			1
‘ rumours of a $ 100 million ( £ 60 million ) offer from @entity10 to buy @entity14 that reverberated through @entity3 this week were shot down by two people familiar with the social networking giant ’s plans , ’ said mr @entity19			1
the move is a drastic departure from @entity10 ’s current stance of not allowing users to display fake names			1
@entity10 is yet to comment on the rumours			1
confidential : the @entity14 app allows people to post anonymous messages - however , their friends are alerted that ' a fiend ' has posted , raising fears the service could be misused @entity14 , launched two months ago , was created by two former @entity45 engineers who were looking for a way to let people deliver genuine feedback to co-workers			1
the app tells users when a friend has posted a secret — they just do n't know which friend			1
it has been especially popular in @entity3 and its satellite technology communities outside of the @entity56			0
secret tries to add a layer of accountability to anonymous posts by showing users ' secrets to their friends and allowing only friends , or friends of friends , to comment on each shared post			1
to sign up , users provide their mobile phone number , email address or both			2
when you post a secret , your phone and email contacts who are also on @entity14 will be able to see it			1
if they tap a heart icon indicating that they ‘ love ’ your secret , then their friends will be able to see it too			0
you wo n't know which of your friends is on @entity14			2
@entity14 says it ensures security by encrypting posts and without uploading contact information to its servers			2
the app also offers a panic button , called ‘ unlink my posts			2
’ when a user clicks it , any link between them and all previous secrets they have posted is removed			0
however , in december @entity98 noted that this could be about to change after @entity10 hosted a three - day hacker event in which apps that could be used anonymously were developed			2
the event was part of a project called @entity105 with aims to develop a variety of new apps for the social media site			0
although anonymity apps are being criticised as platforms for bullying , supporters say they can be tools for preventing mischief			0
they also have a cathartic value for some users			0
‘ my baby boy passed away recently			0
i saw his picture today and cried			0
i cried because i love him and miss him			0
i 'm a guy , so no one thinks to talk to me , ’ read a recent post on @entity14			1

’ @entity129 , a professor who studies online culture and communications at the @entity132 , believes there 's a ‘ significant degree to which people want to be associated with their words , ’ get comments , likes and acknowledgements for them			0
anonymity apps , he says , could have a difficult time maintaining a business model because they are exposing themselves to a lot of liability			0
‘ i do n't want to dismiss the optimistic view that the makers of these apps have , ’ he said			0
‘ but i do n't have that much evidence yet that these apps are appealing for a better nature			0
’ out in the open : the move is a drastic departure from @entity10 's current stance of not allowing users to display made - up names			1

the @entity14 app showcases startling confessions about what a person really thinks but is n’t willing to share on sites like @entity9 and @entity10
reports *suggest* @entity11 has had a meeting with the @entity14 founders
if @entity10 develops its own app , the move will be a drastic departure from its current stance of not allowing users to display fake names
