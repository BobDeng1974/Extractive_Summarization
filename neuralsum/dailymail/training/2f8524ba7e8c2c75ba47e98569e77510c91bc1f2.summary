last updated at 6:35 pm on 27th october 2011 it would n't be @entity1 if preparations for the newest grand prix in the calendar were n't a bit last minute			1
and today , as @entity8 star @entity7 whizzed round the new £ 250m @entity9 , near @entity10 , in a rickshaw , workers were carrying out a series of last minute fixes			1
clumps of grass were being replaced , other sections were being painted and the stands were given a wash down with hoses ahead of tomorrow 's first practice session			1
as the touches were applied , nervous officials looked on desperately hoping the country will be able to shake off the image of incompetency that accompanied the country 's hosting of last year 's @entity28			1
ready to rock : @entity7 pulls to a stop after testing the new @entity1 @entity30 in a motorised rickshaw fastest thing on three wheels : @entity34 driver @entity7 puts the vehicle through its paces at the new £ 250m @entity9 in @entity37 , 24 miles north of @entity10 another fine drive : @entity7 steps out of an auto rickshaw - he can expect a slightly zippier view of the track from his own car in sunday 's race there are problems with some of the plumbing and electrics , and concerns over the lack of testing that has taken place on the track			1
the drivers will know the track inside out thanks to thousands of hours in their simulators , but with the first race session due to start tomorrow , time is running a bit short only @entity7 's motorised rickshaw , a scooter ridden by former multi world champion @entity63 and a pedal bicycle with @entity66 @entity65 on board have so far been able to sample the 3.1 - mile circuit			1
the prospect of having @entity7 , @entity70 , world champion elect @entity71 and his @entity73 team - mate @entity72 hurtling round the rack at 200mph - plus has many race fans fearing the worst			1
but despite their concerns , and a series of power cuts during the inaugural press conference , confidence remains high among @entity8 chiefs that the event will be an unequivocal success			1
quick lick : a slap of orange is applied to a section of track on a chicane at the new @entity1 @entity30 circuit last - minute fixes : workers attend a grassy patch in need of tidying opposite the main grand stand cleaning the seats : workers with hoses remove some of the dust from a section of the seating at the circuit happy in their work : staff at the track cheer as preparations continue in a particularly @entity1 way circuit length : @entity109 @entity110 : 60 race distance : @entity112 @entity113 compounds to be used : hard / soft full throttle : 65 % ( estimated ) @entity116 changes : 54 average lap speed : 208kph ( 129.245mph ) number of corners : 16 ( 7 left / 9 right ) @entity120 boss @entity119 said : ' @entity121			1
they did everything we wanted them to do within , what , two or three years of reaching the agreement			2
' it took @entity130 in @entity131 25 years , so i think they 've done very well			2
i was pessimistic a fortnight ago			2
i was sent pictures of the track and i thought : ' @entity137 , we 're not going to get it finished in time '			2
' but what they have done in the meantime is incredible			2
the people there are very anxious to be sure they 're doing a good job and they are very passionate about their sport			2
' @entity1 are desperate to remove the stigma that accompanied the debacle of the @entity149 - where corruption was rife , snakes were found in athletes ' hotel rooms and a stadium collapsed with fatal consquences			1
scooting around : @entity155 driver and former world champ @entity63 of @entity157 takes a trip around the circuit yours @entity65 : @entity66 driver @entity65 cycles round the track as flags are flown with pride to drum up interest in the event , which many @entity1 have admitted to remaining completely ignorant about , @entity1 cricket great @entity164 has been drafted in as chief cheerleader			2
he will wave the checkered flag on the race while @entity172 's leading lights will also jostle for a share of the limelight before the start			2
the race has also been given the seal of approval by retired triple world champion @entity179 , who said : ' i just walked in and it looks hugely impressive			0
digit analysis : @entity70 gives the thumbs - up to fans while @entity119 , president and ceo of @entity187 , whose dream it was to stage a race in @entity1 indicates his thoughts to @entity191 chairman and team principal @entity192 ' from just driving in , the scale of it , it 's extraordinary			1
i think it 's wonderful and this is the new world			0
when we think of the old world , we ca n't do that			0
' but it will still take two years to get it right			0
just like it will take two years to get the new @entity130 complex right			0
' it 's not anything to do with @entity1 or @entity131 , it 's to do with just the realities of making everything synchronised and working without any glitches			0
' champion effort : @entity73 driver and title - winner elect @entity71 of @entity157 signs his autograph on a wall of murals at the @entity37 circuit @entity220 's welcome : world champion in waiting @entity71 of @entity157 poses for a photograph with local children paint job : @entity73 - @entity226 driver @entity71 of @entity157 checks a line marker while inspecting the track with his team officials and @entity230 , father of @entity232 and head of the @entity234 , said : ' let 's be honest , it 's like a new - born child			1
' you 've got to nurse it along			0
we 've all got to accept there are a few shortcomings but at least the will to do it is there			0
that 's the most important factor			0
' there 's no lack of money or will to do it			1
the promoters are very clear			0
whatever it takes , spend it			0
' speaking of the track itself , he added : ' you 've got some electrical and plumbing issues but the circuit , talk to any driver and i think they are absolutely gobsmacked this morning			0
in the fast lane : a view of the grand stand ahead of sunday 's @entity1 @entity267 home hope : @entity191 - @entity155 pit staff push a team car out for inspection ahead of tomorrow 's grand prix practice sessions ' they loved the circuit			1
there 's not a single team principal that has n't come up to me and said what a fantastic circuit it is			0
' @entity71 , who will be gunning for his eleventh victory of a season in which the @entity157 could still equal compatriot @entity63 's 2004 record with @entity282 of 13 in a single year , said he had been busy learning the layout of the new track , but had not yet drive on it			0
the 24 - year - old said : ' by the time we race in @entity1 , i 'll have done several laps of the track on the simulator			1
we 're expecting the track to have the second highest average speed of the season after @entity295			0
a worker paints dry grass with green paint in the pits two women responsible for watering the plants go about their work at the circuit a farmer waters a a parched field manning the fence : security guards on duty at the track in @entity37 ' that means that we 'll be completing a lap at an average speed of 235kph , so there should be plenty of good opportunities to overtake			0
' @entity34 - based @entity191 , who have no @entity1 drivers or mechanics , have taken out full - page advertisements in local media and set up a website calling on fans to ' raise the flag ' under the slogan ' one nation			1
on the track , the main battle will be between @entity73 , @entity332 and @entity282 with the leading drivers focusing purely on winning now that the championships are over			0
