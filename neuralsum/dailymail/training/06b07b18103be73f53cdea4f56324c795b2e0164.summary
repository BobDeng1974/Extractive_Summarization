@entity1 referee @entity0 will be the fourth official during @entity3 's home game against @entity4 on sunday - a week after wrongly showing @entity5 a yellow card for diving			1
the 46 - year - old , who had already been appointed as referee for tuesday night 's clash between @entity11 and the @entity3 , has come in for criticism after booking the forward during @entity15 's 3 - 0 win against @entity16			2
@entity5 appeared to be fouled inside @entity16 ' area by defender @entity18 but @entity0 awarded @entity20 's side a free - kick and cautioned the @entity22 for simulation			0
@entity18 makes clear contact with @entity5 as the @entity22 falls to the ground inside the box @entity0 books @entity5 for diving despite the @entity15 striker 's pleas of innocence @entity5 is clearly fouled inside the area by @entity18 but was booked for a dive inside the opening 10 minutes there has been no indication from the @entity1 that @entity0 not being given a match to officiate is related to his performance at @entity39 's on sunday			1
former @entity1 referee and @entity42 columnist @entity40 believes @entity0 ' decision to show @entity5 a yellow card was one of the worst decisions of the season			1
he wrote on sunday : ' @entity0 , often considered as the weakest member of the select group of referees , made one of the worst decisions of the season when he somehow missed @entity18 wipe @entity5 out for a stonewall penalty			2
' as if that was not bad enough @entity0 then rubbed salt in the wound by showing @entity57 a yellow card for diving ! however , @entity15 won the match comfortably enough so does it really matter that @entity0 made such a blatant mistake – after all he is human ? well i think it does			0
@entity0 has a heated discussion with @entity15 boss @entity65 on sunday at @entity39 's @entity0 also showed a red card to @entity15 defender @entity67 ( second from right ) against @entity16 ' firstly @entity5 has a yellow card to his name that , however wrong , can not be over turned			1
he could end up being suspended for accumulating cautions			0
' next his booking will be recorded as simulation which will mar the @entity1 statistics and be forever against @entity5 ’s record			0
' @entity0 , who will take charge at the @entity77 just over 48 hours after his controversial display on the south coast , will work underneath referee @entity80 at in sunday 's lunchtime kick - off at @entity82 .			0
