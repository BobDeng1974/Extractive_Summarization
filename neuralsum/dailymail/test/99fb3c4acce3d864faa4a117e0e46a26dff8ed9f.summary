' i think that 's the beauty of the show : as women , we accept our femininity and take strength from it , as opposed to trying to hide it and behave in a masculine way			2
' as series five begins , other female characters are battling for survival - and vengeance			1
@entity27 is an assassin and a nomad , her older sister @entity55 is forced to rely on her feminine wiles and sinister queen @entity25 clings to power in @entity61			0

despite the succession of ever more imaginative and shocking demises , @entity28 , who plays @entity27 - the feisty child warrior who has yet to learn of her brother @entity148 's killing at the massacre dubbed the @entity151 - has promised even bigger shocks in the new episodes			2

" yet , according to the 17 - year - old , viewers better brace themselves when the new series starts on @entity167 in the @entity168			2
