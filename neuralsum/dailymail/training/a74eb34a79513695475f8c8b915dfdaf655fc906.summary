for 21 years , @entity0 has been ingrained in @entity2 video game history			1
but now , as the 2015 version of the game was released into the public domain at midnight on thursday , @entity0 did not feature in the @entity7 squad for the first time ever			2
@entity2 was first produced in july 1993 , under the guise of ' @entity10 ' , and has been released every season since , but after @entity0 ' retirement at the end of last season , @entity2 15 features a @entity7 squad without their most capped player			1
hundreds queued overnight on thursday to be some of the first to get their hands on this year 's release			1
@entity21 's @entity20 also appeared in @entity24 's @entity23 store to play against some lucky youngsters prior to the game 's launch at midnight			2
@entity21 's @entity20 plays the new @entity2 game with a lucky youngster ahead of its release @entity0 ' ( left ) role now sees him assisting @entity32 from the bench , rather than the pitch how @entity0 looked when the first @entity2 game was released in 1993 ( left ) , and how he looks now ( right ) hundreds queued at @entity39 's @entity38 game to buy their copy of the game at midnight on thursday this year 's version of the popular video game also includes plenty of new features , as the game prides itself on improving year on year			1
@entity56 88 experts claim it is now much more lifelike - the corner flags bend if your player collides with it , the advertisement hoardings alongside the pitch have moving animations			0
should you strike a ball against the woodwork from range , you may notice the bar shaking as play continues , or if your star striker misses a sitter early on , his willingness to shoot and accuracy thereafter will decrease with his lack of confidence			0
most professional footballers love trying out the game - @entity79 players were pictured this week picking up their copies before general release - but this year is the first time @entity0 will not be able to pick up a controller and play as himself			0
it has been a difficult start to the season for @entity7 - they currently sit 12th in the @entity87			0

the first @entity2 was released in 1993 , *called* ' @entity10 '
@entity0 has been a professional footballer for every season until now
@entity92 was released on thursday , and does not include @entity0
