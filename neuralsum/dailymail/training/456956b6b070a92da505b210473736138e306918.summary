@entity0 across the @entity1 were declaring ' mea culpa ' on tuesday after terrifying predictions of 3 - feet of snow and hurricane - strength winds failed to materialize for much of the region			1
tens of millions of people , from southern @entity9 to @entity10 , hunkered down for a storm that for most failed to live up to predictions that it would be one of the worst they 'd ever seen			1
forecasters originally said the storm could bring 1 - 3 feet of snow and punishing hurricane - force winds in @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity9 with authorities describing it as ' historic '			1
the 20 inches of snow predicted for @entity19 failed to materialize historic storm , what historic storm ? @entity33 was still facing blizzard conditions on tuesday but much of the @entity1 which had been threatened with an unprecedented storm emerged relatively unscathed the @entity36 said @entity37 and @entity38 , @entity39 , could get the most snow , about 2 feet			1
in places like @entity43 and @entity44 , @entity45 , more than two feet of snow had fallen in a blizzard that continued to pound the region on tuesday afternoon			1
@entity19 was threatened with predictions of 10 - 20 inches , @entity49 , @entity50 , 1 - 2 feet , and @entity51 and central @entity20 about 6 inches			1
but early tuesday , they downgraded most of those numbers , saying @entity33 would fare the worst - but even then not as bad as expected			1
some @entity9 weather forecasters threw up their hands and admitted on their @entity57 page : ' we are throwing in the towel on this system			1
' the post continued : ' we blew the call , and everyone blew it - and amending or lowering your original call is not nailing it either			1
no one got this right , plain and simple			0
one @entity20 weatherman took to @entity69 late on monday night to admit that he had got the forecast wrong - and he was n't alone another meteorologist posted a social media mea culpa late on tuesday night as residents in the tri-state area stared out the window and wondered what happened to the ' historic ' storm @entity80 also held their hands up to a skewed prediction for @entity19 - but they had n't missed the mark on the greater @entity83 where some places saw more than 2 feet of snow ' so although we put countless hours of time and effort into this one , we failed			1
yes we got and will get snow , but nowhere close to the epic amounts that up until today looked to be spot on			1
' so this is our ' man - up ' post			1
it was n't hyped , it was n't sensationalized			0
it was the right call from a physics and forecasting standpoint , but in the end , mother nature humbled us			0
' @entity20 meteorologist , @entity99 , also tweeted his apologies : ' my deepest apologies to many key decision makers and so many members of the general public			0
' you made a lot of tough decisions expecting us to get it right , and we did n't			0
once again , i 'm sorry			0
' according to @entity110 , one of the biggest decisions in forecasting the weather is whether to trust the @entity115 or @entity116 model - and with winter storm @entity117 , they both predicted different outcomes			1
@entity120 tweeted : ' the @entity122 model , the most reliable of them all , has @entity124 the city see a foot of snow ? probably			2
but all of us have failed to an extent			2
' while @entity131 added : ' still , blame is on us as meteorologists - ca n't be placed anywhere else			2
it is a difficult day for us any time a forecast does not work out			0
' a stream of usually reliable meteorologists came out and tweeted their apologies for getting the forecast wrong - and the public were mostly gracious in their responses @entity142 was mostly deserted on tuesday lunchtime after travel bans over night on monday clearly had a knock - on effect and kept most people at home although parts of the @entity1 were only sideswiped by the so - called ' historic storm ' , @entity50 was battered by snow and high winds ( pictured on tuesday ) a man walks in the cold weather along the snow - covered boardwalk on tuesday morning in @entity156 , @entity20 the @entity36 over the weekend had issued a blizzard warning for a 250 - mile swath of the region , meaning heavy , blowing snow and potential whiteout conditions			1
mayor @entity162 was defiant and unapologetic on tuesday morning , saying that forecasts across the board has predicted 2 feet of snow , adding : ' we did what was necessary to keep everyone safe ... this is a better safe than sorry scenario			1
' by midday , snow had slowed to a light flurry in @entity19 and the temperature hovered around @entity175			2
travel bans on the roads had been lifted for the majority of @entity19 counties and @entity20			0
@entity180 , which was battered by the storm overnight , had travel restrictions lifted - even though some places , like the town of @entity185 , got around 20 inches of snow			1
the highest snowfalls in @entity19 were reported in eastern @entity188 and at @entity189 which saw almost 12 inches of snow - a decent amount , but far from a historic storm in the @entity193			1
mayor @entity162 has come in for criticism following precautions which basically shut down the city			0
on monday , life abruptly stopped across the region as officials ordered workers to go home early , banned travel , closed bridges and tunnels , and assembled their biggest plowing crews			0
' when you wake up in the morning , it is going to look like a blizzard , ' said @entity45 governor @entity209 , echoing the concern of many government leaders			0
light snow fell steadily early on tuesday in @entity213 as a few municipal trucks rumbled down empty streets			2
the city had an almost eerie , post 9/11 feel to it : no airplanes in the sky			0
more than 7,700 flights in and out of the @entity1 were canceled , and many of them may not take off again until wednesday			0
schools and businesses let out early			0
the shutdown in the entire @entity19 public transport network meant that some commuters were forced to take alternative measures , such as this gentleman picture cross-country skiing in @entity232 @entity233 leaves a two foot tall path as he uses a snow blower to dig himself out of the snow on tuesday in @entity237 , @entity45 government offices closed			2
shoppers stocking up on food jammed supermarkets and elbowed one another for what was left			0
mayor @entity246 urged @entity19 to go home and stay there , adding : ' people have to make smart decisions from this point on			2
' in @entity20 , plows and salt spreaders remained at work on the roads on monday night in @entity255 , one of the coastal areas that was expected to be among the hardest hit			0
there was a coating of snow on the roads but hardly any vehicles were traveling on them , as residents seemed content to stay indoors and monitor the storm in comfort			1
most businesses in the area had gone dark , including some convenience stores and gas stations			2
on @entity27 , however , the @entity272 said it would operate normally on tuesday as well			0
coastal residents braced for a powerful storm surge and the possibility of damaging flooding and beach erosion , particularly in @entity20 and on @entity43 in @entity45			2
