by @entity0 published : 10:31 est , 21 june 2012 updated : 04:38 est , 22 june 2012 when keen vegetable grower @entity2 won the lottery , there was one thing money could n’t buy			1
his £ 24.9million @entity8 fortune brought him a luxury farmhouse , with a @entity10 in his garage , and new homes for his daughters			1
but the perfect carrot crop continued to elude him			1
honest : @entity2 admits if he 'd won the money when he was younger it might have changed him more pride : mr @entity2 is still a regular at his allotment in @entity19 , @entity20 despite his huge win the 77 - year - old grandfather won the jackpot three years ago , and admitted at the time that the performance of his carrots on his beloved allotment was one of his few regrets			1
‘ i have been trying to grow carrots ever since i have been on that plot and i have never had any success , ’ he said			1
‘ i have followed every instruction in the book and never had a single success			1
’ he promised , however , that life as a multi-millionaire would not see him abandon his blessed plot			1
and not only has he been true to his word , but with much more time to devote to his hobby , he has at last conquered his carrot conundrum			2
his secret ? growing them in pots with fresh compost			2
@entity45 : mr @entity2 's win has allowed him to get night vision cameras fitted to the allotment to watch wildlife mr @entity2 said : ‘ my allotment is still a lovely place to go to get away from it all			1
but one thing that has changed since the lottery win is my approach to growing carrots			2
‘ i could never grow them before the win and then i was given a tip to grow them in pots			2
apparently they always come up because you ’re putting in a fresh supply of compost			2
that ’s what i ’m doing now and it works			2
’ that leaves him with only one ambition unfulfilled since his numbers came up – the slightly more costly desire to visit @entity73			0
mr @entity2 was chairman of the @entity74 in @entity19 when he became one of the country ’s largest euromillions winners in 2009			1
since then he has swapped the modest semi where he and his wife @entity79 , 76 , spent the first 50 years of their marriage and bought a £ 1.25million five - bedroom farmhouse three miles away			1
as well as the @entity10 , the retired export manager for a brewery engineering firm has bought homes for daughters @entity86 , 51 , and @entity88 , 47 , with land and stables			1
but after the early days during which his £ 35 - a - month allotment began to look understandably neglected , he has been true to his word , busily perfecting his vegetable - growing skills			0
‘ i have got fruit trees with plums , damsons , tomatoes , ’ he said			0
‘ i also have onions and , of course , carrots			0
i do n’t plant anything unless it gives me something back			0
i have still got my damson jam from last year			0
’ new wheels : mr @entity2 did splash out on this @entity10 but insists he has n't let his new wealth change him his wealth has enabled him to cut a few corners , he admitted			1
‘ the win has allowed me to enjoy my passion more of course – and allowed me to employ someone to help			0
’ the pensioner said the lottery win had not changed the family			0
‘ @entity117 before the win we always went away as a family , all ten of us , once a year			0
we still keep that up , ’ he said			0
‘ if i was 40 when it happened then it probably would have changed me more because you have got a long life ahead of you , but i have not got that privilege at my age			0
‘ i still play the lottery because as someone said to me recently , i have as much chance as anybody else			0

@entity2 bought a new house and a @entity10 but kept his plot
he is helping *novice* *gardeners* by letting them loose on his patch
