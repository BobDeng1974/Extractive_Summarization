' while @entity17 culture has a deeply rooted preference for sons , and many girls are expected to spend their lives caring for first their brothers and later their husbands , the 23 - year - old 's parents had encouraged their hard - working daughter 's dreams of becoming a doctor			1
' i never discriminated between my sons and daughter			2
i could see nothing else in this world but my children			2
they had to study at any cost , ' her father said , who supported his daughter when she said she wanted to study physiotherapy in a hill town far from her @entity4 home - a longer but more affordable route to a future career in medicine			1
as money was scarce , he asked his older son , who is in his late teens , to delay enrolment at an engineering college until his sister finished her studies			0

i wanted different things for my children , ' said the victim 's father , who is in his mid-fifties , and works 16 hour days as a baggage handler at @entity4 airport to support his family			1

' now that she is gone i ca n't even see tomorrow clearly			0
i have no idea about the future			0
' she worked night shifts at a call centre to help cover her rent and fees at a college in the @entity144 foothills			0
most days she slept for just a few hours in her rented room , and her parents would call her every morning to ensure she got up for class			1
anger : protestors tried to break through a police cordon at a demonstration in @entity4 following the savage assault , which has galvanised public anger in @entity17 over sex attacks by december she was back in @entity4 , living at home and awaiting the results of her final exams			1
but on december 16 , after getting on a bus home after seeing a movie at a film with a male friend , she fell victim to a devastating attack			1
according to police documents the bus was being driven by six men out for a joyride			2
for almost an hour the student and her friend were driven through the city			2
she was gang - raped , and penetrated with metal rods , causing such severe internal injuries that doctors found parts of her intestines floating inside her abdomen			1
eventually , the two were dumped , naked and bleeding , by a busy road on the cold december night			0
' imagine how much she must have suffered , ' her brother said			0
' we would fight , you know			0
brothers and sisters fight too			0
and if i pushed her too hard she felt pain			0
' ' for almost 10 days her brain was alert , " said her mother , a slim woman wrapped in a sari , her eyes red from weeks of weeping			0
police and a magistrate took statements from her in a @entity4 hospital			1
she remembered the names of her attackers			2
she recognized the faces in the photographs police showed her			0
she broke down only once			0
' she told me " @entity207 , they beat me a lot "			2
' that was the only time she showed her pain , ' the mother said			0
' without her we are lost ' : in a country where girls are routinely pushed into lives of subservience , the student 's parents had encouraged their bright , hard - working daughter to shine when infection began to ravage her body , she was flown with her family to a @entity45 hospital			1
but she slipped into a coma at @entity225 and died on december 29			2
now , her relatives feel varying degrees of rage and helplessness			0
' sometimes i want to kill them myself , ' her brother said			0
' but i know that would be wrong			0
' if convicted , five of the attackers could face death sentences			1
a sixth , declared a juvenile , would likely serve three years in reform home if convicted			2
' i want them to hang			0
they should not come out alive after what they did to my child , ' said the father			2
' this is not just about my daughter			0
if there is no justice in this case it will hurt the progress of girls in the whole country			0
every parent will be afraid for their daughters			0
' the girl 's mother said : ' i always told my children , if you study hard you can escape this poverty			2
