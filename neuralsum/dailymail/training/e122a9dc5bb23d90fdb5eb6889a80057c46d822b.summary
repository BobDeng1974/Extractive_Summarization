by @entity0 published : 21:11 est , 2 march 2013 updated : 08:04 est , 3 march 2013 an iconic mansion given to @entity3 by the billionaire founder of the @entity6 's french fry has been handed back to his heirs because it 's too expensive to run , it was announced yesterday			1
@entity8 , whose company @entity8 invented the frozen fry in 1953 and has been the primary supplier of the potato snack to @entity6 's for more than 50 years , gifted the luxurious property overlooking his home city of @entity14 to the state in 2004			2
the eccentric billionaire , who grew up in a log cabin and had just $ 80 when starting his company at age 14 , decided he wanted his family home to belong to his beloved state and it should become the governor 's house			1
thanks but no thanks : @entity8 's mansion will be returned to his heirs by @entity3 which was gifted the property in 2004 mr spud : @entity8 built a multi-billion dollar fortune in agriculture and specifically providing @entity6 's with potatoes for their fries however , after nine years of being snubbed by governors not wanting to look too lordly by living in the home and a cost of $ 150,000 a year maintaining it - mostly watering its lush green lawns - city officials have decided it is more hassle than it 's worth			1
on friday a meeting of the @entity3 governor 's @entity43 agreed to return the 7,379 square foot property , valued at $ 2million in 2004 , to the billionaire @entity8 heirs			1
the agreement said though officials are ' very grateful ' for the gift they believe it 's ' in the best interest of the state and the @entity8 family to return it			2
' @entity8 's heirs originally insisted @entity3 keep the property but are now said to be more amenable to taking it back			1
flying the flag : @entity8 's one stipulation in his multi-million dollar gift was that an @entity62 flag fly over the property at all times million dollar view : the mansion sits atop of a hill in @entity14 , @entity3 , but has never been lived in by a governor @entity8 is a well - known figure in the town of @entity14 where he founded his small agricultural company in 1929 specializing in potatoes and onions			1
his fortunes rocketed overnight when company scientist @entity75 invented the frozen french frie and made the company millions - not least of all from its work for the fast food chain which it started supplying back in 1960			1
down - to - earth @entity8 's favorite food was said to be @entity6 's fries or hash browns made from his own produce and he often stopped in the chain to enjoy the snack despite his vast wealth			0
he donated millions to the town including the mansion at 4000 @entity90 which was home to the @entity8 family before his death in 2008 at age 99			2
uncertain future : it is unclear what will now happen to the @entity8 mansion which will be returned to the family by the end of june open doors : the mansion was generously gifted to the state but they claim it is too expensive to maintain @entity105 : the proud entrepreneur from @entity3 wanted to use his wealth to support the state by donating the house as he donated it the agricultural baron known as mr @entity112 , who by then had also set up @entity113 making microchips , said : ' as governors go and come , they 'll enjoy it , i hope			1
they wo n't have any trouble from me , that 's for sure			0
' the house has it 's own website and is described as the ' @entity125 ' or ' @entity126 ' in short			0
the website says : ' it serves as the center of the @entity129 's ceremonial , social and political activities			0
' because the house is also a significant landmark in the valley , ever attempt it made to share this beautiful home with @entity3 's citizens while continuing to meet the building 's primary function as home for the @entity139 's chief executive '			1
lying empty : officials say it is too expensive to maintain the home that no governors have ever lived in a look inside : pictures reveal the large mansion which has n't been lived in no one home : governors have snubbed the mansion choosing to remain in their own homes ironically it has never actually been home to a governor with officials snubbing it lest they be seen as snobbish			2
some residents oppose the state 's decision to ditch the property which now faces an uncertain future			0
resident @entity161 told a public meeting in october : ' you ca n't have @entity3 without that flag and without that hill			2
if we have any pride in the guy who really helped develop the state , we should keep it the way it is			0
' the property , which comes with 37.479 acres , has the condition that a 30 - by - 50 @entity62 flag continually fly on a 130 foot flagpole above the house on the hilltop overlooking the town			0
at a meeting in october it emerged much of the maintenance fee was being spent on keep the house 's lush lawn watered			0
$ 300,000 was also spent furnishing the mansion			0
it will be returned to the family by june 30 and be emptied over the next 30 days			0
the state has said it may look at building a new governor 's house which is more manageable once the transfer is complete .			1

@entity194 donated his iconic ' house on the hill ' to @entity3 in 2004 so it could become the governor 's home
however , the cost of maintaining the mansion is so high , city officials have now opted to hand it back to his heirs
some are angry at the decision and believe it is *disrespectful* to the french frie maker and local *legend* known as ' mr @entity112 '
