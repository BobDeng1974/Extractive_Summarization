from the 1990s , well - known ' easy ' courses were on offer at the @entity2 school 's @entity13 and @entity12			1
the classes were attended in high numbers by football players , basketball stars and wrestlers among others , allowing them to coast through academic life and focus on athletics			0
an investigation in 2012 found that some courses allowed students to get a passing grade just for submitting term papers without attending classes or sitting exams			1
@entity2 officials have admitted that there was a lack of academic rigor in some courses offered through their african - american studies department , disproportionately attended by college athletes some 216 classes at @entity2 were found to have problems over a 15 - year period - and up to 500 students had their grades changed without authorization			1
blame was placed with the former @entity12 chairman @entity46 and former administrator @entity45			0
@entity49 € ™ oro was criminally indicted in december 2013 for defrauding @entity2			2
it is unclear whether the @entity51 at @entity2 pushed for the fraudulent courses or allowed talented athletes to exploit them			1
the school was slow to admit that anything untoward had taken place and earlier this month halted a research project into the literacy levels of @entity2 athletes - which found that several were reading at below third - grade level			1
academic officials are now taking responsibility for a lack of rigor in some students ' educations			0

' chancellor @entity76 also addressed the matter in a statement on the university 's website			2
she said that reforms were underway to fix past problems but added : ' offering courses that were unsupervised was not reflective of the standards that we expect for our @entity2			2
all of those students who were involved in those courses deserved better from us			2
' the pressures on student - athletes to perform outside of the classroom is high as the @entity99 is a multi billion dollar business with millions of fans across the @entity102 college athletes often go on to become the next stars of the @entity105 , @entity106 and at the @entity107			0
the problem is not specific to unc - schools across the country place great importance on lucrative championship wins , so easing off academically on students who are highly talented on the court or field is a common problem			0

the disgraced department of the past has been renamed the @entity13 , @entity121 , and @entity123 department			0
mr @entity67 told @entity68 he would be examining other departments to see if athletes were ' clustering ' in classes that had become known for easy grades			2
