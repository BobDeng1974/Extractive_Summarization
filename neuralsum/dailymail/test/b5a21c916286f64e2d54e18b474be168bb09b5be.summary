‘ it was a very stressful period , it was so stressful preparing for this fight			1
i 've never went through this type of thing before			2
i felt like i had to fight to get here , and that 's been a tough fight			2
' i probably wo n't feel any emotions until after the fight or right before the fight			2
i just wanted to make it here for the fans , though			2
i feel like the fans wanted to see me fight , a lot of fans bought tickets and wanted to watch the pay - per - view and see this fight so i 'm glad to be here			1
' he 's [ @entity5 ] good on paper			1
he 's a stand up fighter ; on paper it 's the type of fight i love so it should be a good show for the fans			2

’ @entity0 , the former light - heavyweight champion , takes on @entity5 at a catchweight of 215lb			1
former light - heavyweight champion @entity0 has been through a stressful fight to make @entity3 comeback ' i 'm tired of fighting guys who are cowards , who just want to take you down and lay on top of you			1
in fights like that , the fans lose , ’ he added			0
' i am a true definition of a fighter , you know what i 'm saying			0
my style is a brawl , a street fighter			0

' we 're both pretty big guys			0
it was stressful preparing for this fight - it was kind of hard for either of us to keep our weight down			1
i just think it 's fair for both of us [ that this is a catch weight fight at 215lbs ]			0
‘ fighting is mostly mental , even the weight loss part of it			0
when you 're stressing out , there 's nothing you can do			0
