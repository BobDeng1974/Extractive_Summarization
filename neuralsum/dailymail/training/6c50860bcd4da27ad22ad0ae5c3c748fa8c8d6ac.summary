past studies have credited oily fish with the ability to cut post-natal depression , reduce the risk of @entity50 's disease and diabetes , stroke and arthritis as well as help children perform better in exams and even add two years ' to a person 's life expectancy			0

the women were given annual tests of thinking and memory skills for an average of six years			1
blood tests were taken to measure the amount of omega - 3s in the participants ' blood before the start of the study			2
the researchers found no difference between the women with high and low levels of omega - 3s in the blood at the time of the first memory tests			1
there was also no difference between the two groups in how fast their thinking skills declined over time			0

@entity26 scientists believe omega - 3 fatty acids do not halt the decline in brainpower as previously thought
the researchers also found that randomised trials of omega - 3 supplements were not found to make a difference
the research tested the cognitive and memory skills of women aged 65 to 80 annually for an average of six years
