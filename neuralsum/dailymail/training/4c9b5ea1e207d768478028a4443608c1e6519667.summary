by @entity0 mrs @entity1 at the @entity2 described the ' grossly cruel ' ordeal of the woman who has a reading age of seven a @entity8 woman with serious learning difficulties married a @entity11 immigrant and had his baby as part of a plan to help him remain in the @entity8 , a secret court heard			1
the 37 - year - old woman – who has a reading age of a child of seven – was even slapped around the face by her mother to force her to smile for the wedding photograph			1
on the day the couple attended a register office to give notice to marry , an anonymous caller rang the office to allege that her parents had been paid £ 20,000 to marry off their daughter to the @entity30 student			1
incredibly , although registrars were concerned about the ‘ demeanour and vulnerability ’ of the bride and feared she was being ‘ manipulated ’ as part of a visa scam , the civil marriage went ahead two months later			0
by then , the woman was pregnant and she went on give birth to a boy			2
her 33 - year - old husband , from @entity43 , is now using his human right to a family life to try to stay in the @entity8 , and lawyers expect him to be granted indefinite leave to remain			1
the case was heard earlier this year by the @entity2 , which has the power to make life - or - death decisions on behalf of people deemed to lack mental capacity			1
it emerged with the publication of an ‘ anonymised ’ judgment			0
in her ruling , mrs justice @entity56 said : ‘ i think there is a very significant possibility that this marriage was entered into , and indeed this child created , for reasons solely to do with immigration status			0
‘ to inflict pregnancy and childbearing on a person who can not consent to that state is about as gross a physical interference as can be imagined			0
' to put an incapacitated person in a position whereby she bears a child which she can not look after is grossly cruel			0
’ the husband ’s two - year student visa expired in september 2011			1
an application for further leave to remain was refused , so he lodged an appeal			0
' as gross a physical interference as can be imagined ' - mrs @entity1 the woman , a @entity81 who has converted to @entity82 , is said to have conceived ‘ almost immediately ’ after their @entity30 wedding that november			2
the next month they met registrars about their civil wedding			0
the registrars contacted the @entity88 , describing her as ‘ obviously learning disabled ’			0
she was not sure of her husband ’s name and could not remember being twice married and divorced – to a nephew of her stepfather and a maternal cousin respectively			1
@entity88 informed social services , who objected to the wedding , but it went ahead			0
a senior registrar was ‘ concerned about being seen not to have taken into account the cultural background and [ the woman ’s ] right to marry and found a family , said mrs justice @entity1			2
the court heard how the woman became pregnant almost immediately after getting married			1
file image the child was made the subject of care proceedings after his birth and placed in foster care , with parental contact			1
according to the judgment , the woman has a reading age of 7.7 years and a learning disability			1
it said social services assessment shows she can not look after her baby safely			0
the groom said he was ‘ duped ’ into marrying the woman by her parents , but now accepts that any ‘ pretence that this is or could be a functioning marriage has now evaporated ’			2
he told the court he wants to be rehoused with the baby in a two - bedroom flat , with social workers visiting for two hours every morning and evening so he can ‘ go to the mosque ’			1
after the judge ’s ruling that the woman could not consent to sex , marriage or where she lived , the husband and the baby are likely to be rehoused separately by the council			2
he is now thinking of having the marriage annulled			0
@entity139 , the @entity140 mp who campaigns to open up family courts , said : ‘ one or more criminal offences have been committed and the registrars or immigration authorities should have reported it to police			0
