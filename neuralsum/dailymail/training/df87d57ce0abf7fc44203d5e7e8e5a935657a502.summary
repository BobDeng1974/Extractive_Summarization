just a year from today , @entity0 went under the knife during a life - changing surgery			2
it was a confronting and traumatic moment when the 33 - year - old saw her own reflection for the first time			0
refusing to hide her body , she asked her friend @entity9 to photograph her scars to illustrate the devastation of her cancer surgery			1
but when the images went viral , the critical reaction is what inspired both queenslanders to do more			2
many found the images ' offensive ' @entity26 ( pictured ) is among the 50 contributors for the under the @entity29 project led by @entity30 and photographer @entity9 @entity26 , who 's from the @entity31 , underwent a total bilateral mastectomy as she has metastatic breast cancer ' i wanted those photos taken because i wanted to finally be comfortable in my own skin , ' mrs @entity0 told @entity37			1
' it was a traumatic change but i trusted @entity9 completely to take a photo that will help my own healing process			2
' the mother - of - four shared her intimate images to a selected number of friends on @entity45 but was shocked to find that she was later ' unfriended ' by more than 100 users			2
the images were reported to @entity45 administrators multiple times , some complaining that they found the nude photos of mrs @entity0 ' offensive '			1
despite the worldwide backlash , mrs @entity0 does n't regret sharing her images and is in fact working on a project inspired by the whole ordeal			1
she and ms @entity9 , 36 , have been working together once again - this time photographing others with a similar story			1

' basically we wanted to show that cancer is n't just about glitter , galas , fun runs or pink ribbons , ' mrs @entity0 said			1
' it 's real and this is people 's lives we 're talking about			0
they go through horrible things and it also puts an emotional strain on their families			0
' it 's hard and scary			0
' mrs @entity0 , who 's now an ambassador for the @entity98 in @entity99 , underwent her double mastectomy and breast reconstruction surgery on november 8 last year			1
' when we found out that i had four lumps in my right breast it was a daunting and it 's still hard for me to talk about the whole experience , ' she said			2
' but i would do it again in a heartbeat			0
i have an obligation to my family and my kids so i know that i 've done the right thing			0
' the scars are now part of my body and it 's a reminder to me of how lucky i am			0
' mrs @entity0 says her scars also keep her on track of her goals of raising awareness for cancer research			1
and this time , her husband has also jumped on board the initiative			0
the 33 - year - old says she does n't regret sharing the photos and hopes it encourages others to accept their scars the @entity130 is now working on a project to help others with a similar story to share their experience @entity134 , 33 , is ready to give up his beloved dreadlocks of three years to raise funds that will help his wife complete her book of photographs for under the @entity29			1
he will be losing the dreads at the end of the month			0
' i 'm so proud of my husband because i know how much he loves his dreadlocks , ' mrs @entity0 said			1
' they 're part of his image and persona and it 's a big sacrifice for him to make			0
' but cancer does n't discriminate and we hope we can finish this book so that people can look at the photos and realise what cancer can do to people 's body and their lives			2
' the project includes contributors worldwide , the youngest being the age of 16			0
mrs @entity0 ( left ) with her friend and photographer @entity9 ( right ) , who are both passionate advocates for cancer research mrs @entity0 and her husband @entity134 , 33 , who will be cutting off his dreadlocks to raise funds for her under the @entity29 project ms @entity9 says each individual has been photographed in a similar concept to mrs @entity0 's images			1
' the book aims to compare and contrast images of each person with what the world sees and what has happened behind the scenes in their life and to their bodies , ' ms @entity9 told @entity37			1
' under the @entity29 allows us to help people bare their grevious bodily scars of cancer and to help them find self acceptance , assist in the anti-body - shaming revolution and banish disease taboos			0
' while the project is still in the works , ms @entity9 says the experience so far has been humbling			1
' i myself have n't had cancer but through this project i 've come to realise that my trials are so trivial and it really puts things into perspective , ' she said			0
