by @entity0 published : 09:35 est , 7 november 2012 updated : 13:06 est , 7 november 2012 @entity1 have received a patent for a technology that could allow the police to disable protesters smartphones , it has emerged			1
the new technology would act as a ' kill switch ' for smartphones , disabling any cameras on the devices and blocking their connection to mobile networks			2
@entity1 stresses that the function would be most likely used to prevent copyright theft , such as in cinemas , or to stop phone cameras being used in inappropriate places , like department store changing rooms			1
however , in the filing for @entity23 patent no. 8,254,902 , the company adds that ' covert police or government operations may require complete " blackout " conditions '			0
@entity28 exposed : this still from footage recorded on a phone , shows students from the @entity34 being pepper sprayed as they stage a sit - down protest			2
a new @entity1 patent could disable the phone cameras of protesters ' additionally , ' it says , ' the wireless transmission of sensitive information to a remote source is one example of a threat to security			1
' this sensitive information could be anything from classified government information to questions or answers to an examination administered in an academic setting			2
' that statement suggests that police and other authorities could use the newly patented feature during protests or political rallies to block transmission of video footage or photographs from the scene			2
in many highly publicised instances , such as during the @entity63 revolutions and even the @entity65 's own occupy protests , pictures and footage from smartphones have proved a crucial tool for citizen journalists documenting police behaviour			0
in one highly publicised case , 21 students from the @entity34 were awarded settlements of $ 30,000 each after a police officer attacked them with pepper spray as they staged a sit - down protest			0
footage of that incident was filmed on the smartphones of dozens of bystanders and eventually broadcast around the world , leading to the suspension of two officers involved and the resignation of their superior officer			2
civil rights campaigners warn that the new technology could limit the ability of concerned citizens to gather evidence of such excessive behaviour by police and security forces			1
the furore over @entity1 's latest patent is not the first it has been accused of collusion with the authorities			1
the @entity100 - based company last month faced claims by hacktivist group @entity102 that it had passed a database of one million @entity1 users to the @entity105			1
@entity102 made the accusation as it released the database online , after allegedly stealing the information from an @entity105 agent 's laptop			0
@entity102 had claimed the data is just a piece of the more than 12 million unique identification numbers and personal information on the device owners that it got from a laptop used by an @entity105 agent			0
however , the @entity105 denied that it ever had that information and @entity1 also said it had not given the information to the @entity105			1
' the @entity105 has not requested this information from @entity1 , nor have we provided it to the @entity105 or any organization , @entity1 spokesperson @entity119 told @entity122			1
the patent for ' apparatus and methods for enforcement of policies upon a wireless device ' was granted in late - august and would allow authorities to change ' one or more functional or operational aspects of a wireless device , such as upon the occurrence of a certain event '			2
this means that those with access to the technology could use it for ' preventing wireless devices from communicating with other wireless devices ( such as in academic settings ) , and for forcing certain electronic devices to enter " sleep mode " when entering a sensitive area '			1
the patent filing makes clear that although @entity1 may implement the feature , any decision on whether to use it would be down to governments , businesses and network operators			1
the technology works via mobile networks , @entity153 , @entity154 or gps , and would send an encoded signal that can selectively shut down features of smartphones within range depending on what kind of policy needs to be enforced			1
@entity1 claims the technology to shut down increasingly ubiquitous wireless devices is necessary since they ' can often annoy , frustrate , and even threaten people in sensitive venues '			1
however , civil rights campaigners have already registered their concern that authorities could misuse the technology			1
@entity169 , director of privacy and civil liberties campaign group @entity171 , said : ' it â€™s been a fact that modern phones are in reality tracking devices that let us make calls , but the idea that awkward citizens might find their phone shut down at the behest of a government agency is a very worrying thought and not one that fits with democratic principles			1
' only last year we had @entity189 state media praising @entity191 politicians for considering a blackout of social media sites and as with the @entity195 , this idea could have been made in @entity189			0
' @entity197 of @entity198 solicitors , who represented the family of @entity200 , the newspaper vendor who died after he was struck by a police officer at protests against the @entity205 in 2009 , told @entity206 the technology could stop police being held to account for their actions			2
' there is something very sinister about governments and the police having the power to block all communication and recording devices except their own , ' he said			0
' this is the sort of technology you might expect to see in @entity189 but not a western democracy			2
' @entity224 and again it is citizen journalism , little brother , which exposes the truth about altercations between citizens and the state			0
' mobile phone video recordings and photographs played a significant role in exposing the truth concerning the death of @entity200 and have regularly been used to expose violent or racist police officers			0
' i struggle to think of any justification for the use of this technology in a democratic society and in some circumstances - such 7/7 - a phone shut down would have hampered the rescue effort and prevented vital evidence being preserved			1
' blackout : students protest against education cuts			0
the new technology would allow police and other agencies to shut off the camera functions of protesters ' smartphones @entity254 of the @entity255 , a campaign group that monitors the activities of police in public order situations , said the technology had the potential to make policing even less transparent			1
' @entity260 and our partners use photographs and video a great deal to monitor and record police behaviour			0
we would certainly be very concerned at any attempts to limit the freedom to do this , ' she told @entity206			0
' texts , tweets , photos and videos are used a great deal by protesters , not only to tell each other what is going on , but also to tell the outside world			0
the disruption of this would be extremely serious			0
' i would also be concerned at the potential for use of this technology by private companies , particularly those who are targeted by protests			0
might they be tempted to ' switch off ' protesters phones to limit bad publicity ? ' policing in the @entity191 is anything but transparent			0
the general public has little trust in the state authorities to " come clean " over the use of this sort of technology			1
' this in itself makes people fearful and anxious			0
what is needed is for the police to me much more open and honest about the way they police us generally , and particularly the way they police public protests			0

technology would broadcast a signal to *automatically* shut down smartphone features , or even the entire phone
@entity1 claims it would most likely be used to prevent copyright theft or to *guarantee* privacy in sensitive areas
civil liberties campaigners fear it could be misused by the authorities to silence ' awkward citizens '
