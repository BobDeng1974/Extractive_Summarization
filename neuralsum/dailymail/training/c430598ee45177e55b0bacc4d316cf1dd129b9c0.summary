@entity0 was disappointed at @entity2 's failure to beat @entity3 , despite his goal deep into stoppage time salvaging a 2 - 2 draw for the @entity7			1
the @entity13 international powered home a header from @entity10 's ball into the box to rescue a point for 10 - man @entity2 , who had dominated the game for long periods			2
@entity20 ' side shifted to three at the back and that caused @entity3 problems throughout , with the hosts dominating possession , but they were unable to make it count			2
@entity51 gave the @entity7 a deserved lead on the stroke of half - time with a delightful finish , but it lasted little over a minute as @entity56 won an aerial duel with @entity0 to make it 1 - 1 at the break			1
@entity0 was culpable again as @entity40 peeled off him at the near post to put @entity3 into a 2 - 1 lead against the run of play just after the hour mark			1
@entity51 shoots through a crowd of bodies in the area to give @entity2 a 1 - 0 lead in the first half when substitute @entity71 saw red for two rash moments it looked like it was slipping away from @entity2 , but @entity0 made the most of the nine minutes of stoppage time - which were a direct result of a head injury he suffered - to atone for his mistakes and earn the @entity7 a point			1
' it was a great cross from @entity10 and i had a header before , but i 've been waiting quite a while for a goal so i 'm really happy , ' he added			0
@entity10 , who looked bright for the hosts , echoed @entity0 's sentiments and now wants them to kick on over the festive period			2
' i thought we were the dominant team throughout the whole game and we created enough to get the victory but that 's the way it 's been going for us lately , ' he said			0
@entity56 won an aerial duel with @entity0 to make it 1 - 1 at the break ' we can take a little bit of momentum out of that goal into the @entity102 period but we 've got games coming up that are winnable and we need to start turning these good performances into wins			1
' @entity20 was delighted with his side , surprisingly heralding their display as being better than the corresponding game last season which @entity2 won 5 - 1			1
' our performance today was better than our 5 - 1 here last year			2
there 's no question about that			0
the dominance we had today was fantastic ( and with all ) the efforts on goal , ' he said			0
the former @entity119 boss highlighted how the passing and movement of his side caused problems for the @entity46 but admitted he was frustrated by the goals they conceded			0
@entity40 puts the ball through the legs of @entity7 goalkeeper @entity128 to give @entity3 the lead at @entity130 even though the 41 - year - old felt @entity131 dived to secure the free - kick that led to @entity56 's leveller , he pointed out that the @entity7 ' failure to clear it on three occasions was simply not good enough			1
' we thoroughly deserved to be at least one up after the first half , but we made bad decisions defensively			0
i do n't think it was a free - kick , i think @entity131 has dived to get the free - kick and the referee bought it , ' @entity20 said			0
' but then we 've got to be better in the box			0
it 's not about organisation it 's about winning the duel and we lost three so from being 1 - 0 up and total domination we found ourselves 1 - 1 at half - time			1
" @entity71 receives his marching orders from referee @entity149 after picking up two yellow cards the @entity2 boss was also critical of the space afforded to @entity40 for the second goal , but he had no complaints about @entity71 's sending off			1
referee @entity149 showed @entity71 his first yellow card after he threw the ball away in anger and then the @entity158 was given his marching orders shortly after for a high tackle on @entity160			2
' @entity71 was just keen to come on and affect the game , ' @entity20 added			2
' he picked up a silly booking for the first one , showing his passion , and obviously the foot up on the second one so there 's no excuse			0
' @entity2 manager @entity20 had no complaints about @entity71 's sending off at @entity130 @entity20 ' opposite number @entity169 felt the draw was the right result and conceded his side struggled to get going in the first half			1
' it was an intense game			0
of course we have the regret that we conceded on a set piece in the last minute but maybe overall a fair result , ' he said			0
' my first job is to win the games and if you can win them and be fair it 's even better , but regret dominates tonight			0
when you 're 2 - 1 up with two minutes to go you want to win the game and overall , objectively , 2 - 2 is a fair result			1

@entity0 struck deep into extra time to salvage a 2 - 2 draw

@entity51 gave the @entity7 a deserved lead before the break
