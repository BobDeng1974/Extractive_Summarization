by @entity0 when vicar 's secretary @entity1 spotted a bird stuck to roof netting , she called the @entity5 to see if they could help			1
what followed , however , was the sort of full - scale emergency response you might expect for a serious road accident			2
two police cars , a rapid response vehicle , and two fire engines , one of which had a cherry picker , were dispatched to the scene in @entity18 , @entity19 , and the road was closed for an hour as emergency crew worked to free the troubled rook			1

she said : ' it was n’t nice watching this poor bird suffer on the rooftop over the road from our window			2
it kept just lying down , like it had died , then trying to get free again when a seagull came over			0
' it was a sorrowful sight , and it seemed so sad to leave him there - after all , it is one of @entity59 ’s creatures , so i just called the @entity5 to let them know			2
' then followed the hour - long rescue operation , estimated to have cost around £ 1,600 , based on an approximate cost of £ 320 per emergency crew , per hour , before the bird was taken to a nearby wildlife centre			1
