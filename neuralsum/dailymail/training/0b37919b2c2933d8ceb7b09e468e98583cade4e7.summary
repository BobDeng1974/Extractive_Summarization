by @entity0 for @entity1 and @entity2 for @entity1 six months on , a year long deep sea search for the @entity5 airlines plane , missing in the @entity6 , will commence in september			1
the southern part of the search zone will be prioritised looking for @entity9 and will see towed vehicles equipped with sonar and video cameras , dragged along the sea floor , off the coast of @entity15			1
in @entity17 , deputy prime minister @entity16 met with his @entity5 and @entity19 counterparts and said they were cautiously optimistic the aircraft will be recovered			2
a year long search will commence in september mr @entity16 said analysis of the airline 's failed satellite phone call attempt to @entity9 suggests the plane might have turned south earlier than previously expected			1
' @entity36 failed satellite telephone conversation was attempted between @entity38 on the ground and the aircraft , and that has suggested to us that the aircraft may have turned south a little earlier than we had previously expected , ' @entity35 reported mr @entity16 saying			2
in @entity17 , deputy prime minister @entity16 ( pictured left ) met with his @entity5 ( middle ) and @entity19 counterparts ( right ) and said they were cautiously optimistic the aircraft will be recovered			2
the 1.1 million square kilometres search zone remains the same size but authorities have been able to make refinements with satellite data			2
' the ( data ) expanded our knowledge of the area , indicating depths up to 1500 metres deeper than previously known , and the identification of two underwater volcanos , ' said mr @entity16			0
the expensive $ 52 million pricetag will be split between @entity28 and @entity5			1
' we have so far committed and spent about $ 15 million ( aud ) and we are also going to match the @entity60 in the tender cost for this search for @entity9			1
we need to find the plane , we need to find the black box to come to a conclusion , ' said @entity5 transport minister @entity66			1
@entity68 search areas planning map			0
a year long deep sea search for the missing @entity5 airlines plane will commence in september @entity35 reported that @entity28 had budgeted up to $ 90 million over the next two years to find the plane but there 's question over whether it would be extended over that period			1
' @entity5 ’s pledge continued and unwavering support in response to the unprecedented nature and scale of this event through our financial commitment , technical expertise , equipment , and stamina in our search for answers , ' said mr @entity16			2
but it 's a race against time			0
more than 200 people have been employed by @entity92 surveying group @entity91 to get the job done as quickly as possible			2
they have a one - year deadline in which to find wreckage of the ill - fated @entity9 , before they will be forced to move on by the @entity97 ( @entity97 )			1
@entity91 must follow the lead provided by the @entity97			2
forming part of its contractual arrangements is that the current search site is to be analysed for a maximum of 12 months			0
‘ we know the time frame we have is about a year , after that we ’ll be working in a new box as provided by the @entity97 – they ’re always refining their data and if they decide before that it ( the plane wreckage ) may be further south or north , they can order us to move at any time , ' said @entity91 managing director , @entity116			1
‘ there ’s certainly no time to waste			0
' the images ( below ) of the search process which have been provided to @entity1 by @entity91 , give a sense of what the @entity92 team is up against			2
the @entity91 , which is 65 metres long , is highlighted by the small circle , dwarfed by the great expanses of the southern @entity6			1
it has just returned to the area after a crew change			0
in a setback for the operation , mr @entity136 said the sister ship , @entity139 , has had to be diverted via @entity140 and away from the @entity141 ' because we were worried about pirates , even though we went through the process of hardening the boat '			1
that included placing barbed wire right about @entity139 to try and prevent any potential hijacking			0
it should arrive in mid-september , about 10 days later than expected			1
' i ’ve got guys visiting factories all around the world looking for the necessary equipment to make this a success , ' mr @entity136 said			0
surveying crews are working against time to give a more accurate account of the sea - bed ahead of sensors being sent down			1
in some cases there will be a drop of 5000 metres but there are differences of up to 500 metres in some areas which need to be mapped before scanning equipment is sent down			0
using its advanced survey vessel , the @entity121 , fitted with state - of - the art multibeam echosounder equipment , @entity91 is conducting a bathymetric survey of the search area			1
the seabed data obtained will assist in the production of maps of the seabed off @entity28			0
@entity91 will spend more than $ 52 million in the next year in the search for @entity9			1
200 personnel will work on the project and are ' finding equipment from factories @entity181 ' mapping work continues in the area designated by the @entity97 , as @entity91 try to make the most of every possible minute			0
‘ they ( the @entity97 ) have done most of the research and determined the suitable box in which we should operate , ’ he said			0
that ‘ box ’ he refers to is in fact 60,000 square kilometres of the southern @entity6 , an area approximately the size of @entity192 , 1600 kilometres off the @entity28 coast			1
‘ we are looking for a debris field at the end of the day and we ’re basing it on a lot of methodology from previous searches , ’ mr @entity136 said			0
optimistically , he added that ‘ we expect to see a debris field ’			0
‘ we are also expecting , in a worst - case scenario , that we will see an engine because one of our proving tests shows that we can identify 2 metre by 2 metre cubed object			1
inside the control room on board the @entity121 where teams will monitor the progress of search equipment scouring the sea bed of the southern @entity6 for debris from @entity9 the @entity121 with a new crew on board is now on its way out to the southern @entity6 for a third mission searching for the wreckage of @entity9			1
@entity91 has 200 people working on the project , around the world ‘ we ’ll run over our proving range and start mowing the lawn , so to speak			2
that 's when we tow our sensors along the bottom			0
' that 's very difficult because of what is down there and part of why the @entity232 were unsuccessful - it 's very deep water we 're working in and there are variances of up to 500 metres or more in some places			0
‘ but our expectations coupled with the data we have gathered to date , is that it is sitting proud somewhere on the sea - bed			1
‘ i ’m not really sure how this will search will end up , it ’s a massive area about the size of @entity192 and the engine you could equate to the size of two big blokes – not an easy task			0
’ the search conducted by the @entity92 firm @entity91 will focus on a 60,000 square kilometre stretch of the @entity6 off the @entity140 coast @entity91 ceo @entity253 with a model of the two ships which are involved in the search for @entity9 @entity9 went missing on march 8 on the way from @entity258 to @entity259 with 239 people on board , including six @entity60 and 153 @entity19 nationals			1
initial analysis of radar data and satellite communication messages following its disappearance indicated it most likely crashed in the southern @entity6 , 2,500km south - west of @entity15			1
but despite an international search effort led by @entity28 and operated out of the @entity271 air force base in @entity15 , no debris from the plane has been found			2
troubled carrier @entity38 is set to be de-listed and made private as part of a major restructure following the twin disasters of @entity9 and @entity274 the first phase of the search for the missing plane was a surface search of probable impact areas , conducted by an international fleet of aircraft and ships , which concluded on april 28			1
an acoustic search , accompanied by a search of the ocean floor in the vicinity of the acoustic detentions was then conducted , also without success			0
the ocean floor search was completed on may 28			0
as part of a major restructure , the @entity5 government recently confirmed that the troubled airline will be de-listed and made private			0
significant job losses are expected			0
the overhaul comes after three unprofitable years and the double disasters of @entity9 and @entity274			0
mr @entity16 and mr @entity66 also discussed ongoing recovery efforts for @entity274 - the @entity38 jet downed by a missile strike over eastern @entity298 on july 17 , killing 298 people , including 38 @entity60 .			2
