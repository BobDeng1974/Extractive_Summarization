@entity2 @entity1 , 45 , was banned for a year after he admitted driving while over the legal limit on the @entity9 in @entity10 in september when he appeared at @entity11 this morning			1
prosecutor @entity12 told the court that @entity14 - who admitted speeding in a 70mph zone in 2009 but kept his licence and job - had failed to stop for two police cars thinking it was ' former colleagues playing a prank '			1
but mr @entity12 said @entity14 's passenger had repeatedly told him ' just stop ' as cars with flashing lights chased him after spotting a defective rear light			1
two police cars attempted a ' boxing in ' manoeuvre to force him to stop but had to abort this when it became clear he would not stop and the public may be at risk			1
mr @entity12 added @entity14 , who claimed to have drunk two large glasses of wine , panicked and told his female passenger : ' my job , my job , i 'm going to lose everything and i 've only got six years left			1
' he eventually reached his home in @entity40 , where he agreed to a breath test			2
@entity14 had previously denied the charge but changed his plea on the morning of his scheduled trial			2
he had intended to fight the allegation on the basis that the breathalyser was faulty and officers had not followed correct procedures			0
@entity50 , mitigating , said the police pursuit had lasted ' only five minutes '			1
his breathalyser reading of 44 micrograms of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath was only narrowly over the legal limit of 35 , she added			0
the pc said he had drunk two glasses of wine ( posed by model ) miss @entity50 said that @entity14 had ' parlous ' finances and his 24 - year - career was now ' effectively over '			1
' he will be punished over and above what many defendants would face in a similar situation , ' she added			0
district judge @entity64 banned @entity14 from driving for 12 months and ordered him to pay a fine and legal costs totalling Â£ 1,115			0
he said : ' you must deal with drink driving on a regular basis and you must see the consequences of that			0
' it was a very unwise decision to drive that night and you exacerbated that by not stopping for the police			2
' @entity14 was previously convicted of driving at more than 30mph above the normal limit at @entity75 in @entity76			0
he told the court he had been suffering from stress and was late for work			0
but instead of banning him from driving , magistrates decided to put six penalty points on his previously clean driving licence and issue him with a fine			0
at the time , road safety campaigners criticised that decision , labelling it an example of ' one rule for police and another for everybody else ' .			2
