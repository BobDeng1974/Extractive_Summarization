by @entity0 published : 10:17 est , 14 february 2014 @entity2 : 10:50 est , 14 february 2014 a nine - year - old girl has shunned endless hours of watching tv and playing children ’s computer games to read an amazing 364 books - in just seven months			1
@entity8 is such a bookworm she prefers a daily intake of @entity11 and @entity12 to tv ’s @entity14 and @entity13			1
the youngster has been hailed a real - life ' @entity17 ' after the book - loving @entity20 schoolgirl created by author @entity21			2
@entity8 , a nine year old girl from @entity22 , @entity23 , is a real - life @entity17 who just loves to read , just like the @entity21 character and she has been rewarded with a certificate of achievement from award - winning author @entity27 who penned @entity28 to @entity29 and @entity30			1
recent figures show that , unlike , faith , today ’s youngster spends more time during their childhood watching tv than they spend at school			1
according to scientists , by the age of seven , a child will have spent a full year glued to screens , with the average 10 - year - old having five tvs readily available to watch at home			1
but @entity44 ’s mother @entity43 , 35 , a housewife from @entity45 , @entity23 , said : ' @entity44 says reading is just as stimulating as tv or computer games , more so even , as you have to use your own imagination rather than letting the screen conjure it all up for you			1
' i do n’t think it ’s particularly bad , or inherently wrong , for children to be sat in front of the television , or playing on computers - but i do think it ’s a shame that for many children these forms of entertainment have entirely taken the place of reading			1
her reading has even caught the eye of acclaimed author @entity27 and she has her own review section in the local library @entity44 initially found reading a struggle but fell in love with it when she was seven after being encouraged to read more by her family and teachers ' personally i do n’t think there ’s anything wrong with watching television , and films - but only as long as you keep a pretty close eye on the subject matter of what your children are viewing			1
' my only real " rule " on the tv revolves around the fact that we have always had only one television in the house			2
' so , whatever programme is on has to be suitable for whoever is in the house at the time , and there has to be a group decision to play on the @entity95 computer games			2
' but i always take the time out to help @entity44 by listening to her read			2
i think more parents should share a bedtime story with their children in the hopes that they will develop a passion for reading as much as my daughter has			2
' faith with her letter from @entity27 , one of her favourite authors whose books she devours @entity44 initially found books a struggle but fell in love with reading when she was seven after being encouraged to read more by her family and teachers at @entity116			1
she started with short stories which were moderately easy to read but now , only two years on , takes on more challenging @entity120 books and novels penned by @entity27 - which can run to 400 pages			1
@entity44 began to keep track of her reading at the suggestion of her mother			2
as well as @entity120 , she reads @entity131 adventures created by @entity132 , the @entity133 , plus books by @entity136 author @entity135			2
after classes she scours her local library at @entity22 looking for the latest new titles			0
staff have even give her a section of the library to herself to quietly read and have created a display board showing her book recommendations for other youngsters			0
faith has been hailed a real - life @entity17 after the book loving @entity20 schoolgirl created by author @entity21 and played by @entity151 @entity44 began to keep track of her reading at the suggestion of her mother and loves @entity120 and @entity131 adventures she has also written a guest review on @entity120 for the @entity157 blogsite : ' this @entity158			1
' mrs @entity8 said : ' i am thrilled @entity44 has found something that she takes such pleasure in , that makes her feel positive about her own ability and of course , helps her at school too			1
mrs @entity8 said : ' i am thrilled @entity44 has found something that she takes such pleasure in , that makes her feel positive about her own ability and of course , helps her at school too ' ' i initially read all the @entity168 to her - it took nearly a year to read all seven aloud and she has read a few of the earlier ones to herself too			1
' she ’s read a lot of @entity21 and particularly likes @entity173 - although i ’m not sure @entity44 is like @entity17 because until she was seven @entity44 could hardly read at all			0
' she added : ' it is wonderful to see @entity44 's excitement with every new book she opens			0
i ’m proud in everything that she does			0
' the only minor point of contention over her reading is that she does n’t seem to have much time judgement			2
often my husband and i will head for bed at around 11 or midnight and she ’ll still have her nose in a book			0
' we have to ask her to stop reading and switch off the light because she just does n’t want to stop - it seems like she has escaped into her own little world			0
' @entity44 said : ' i mostly like the kind of books with animals or magic or adventures in them			0
if they have all three of those things then it ’s even better			0
' when i first started , i was n’t actually trying to read that many books , my mummy just thought that it would be a good idea to keep track of every book i had read			0
' but my life is not all about books			0
i do four hours of gymnastics every week , do karate classes , play netball and i ’m learning to play the drums			0
' i also like climbing , and riding my bike , rollerblading - and watching the odd bit of television			0
but for me , reading is the most fun thing to do			0
@entity8 loves sports as well as reading and has just started to learn kickboxing ' my bedroom looks like it ’s built out of books , ' she said			1
' i have three packed bookcases and piles of books wobbling everywhere so yes , i ’m running out of room ! ' it ’s just too hard to choose a favourite book but if i had to i would probably like @entity131 series the best though			0
@entity227 can help your education , your imagination - and it ’s just so much fun			0
' author @entity27 said : ' @entity227 for pleasure is one of the key factors in a child ’s later educational success , and as a nation we need to get our children reading for the joy of it , and talking excitedly to their friends about books , just as @entity44 is doing			1
