seven decomposing sperm whale carcasses will be removed from a beach in @entity2 after their repulsive smell has been discouraging tourism			1
it had previously been suggested by environmental experts that the whale corpses , which appeared south of the town of @entity9 , about 150km @entity10 of @entity11 , would be left to decompose naturally			0
but @entity12 has now said the repulsive odour from the whales has left the council no choice but to remove the carcasses			1
' we buried two of the whales today			1
the museum is dissecting one for research , and the rest of them will likely be taken care of tomorrow			0
' mr @entity21 said the area where the whales appeared is a prominent site for crabbing , and strong winds were pushing the odour onto the nearby @entity40 township			1
' there was a news team here today , and they were dry reaching from the smell			0
it 's horrendous ' he said			0
@entity46 spokeswoman @entity45 previously told @entity47 the whales might be left to decompose naturally since the beach is not a popular swimming spot			2
but mr @entity21 claims the odour has already been hindering tourism , with would be visitors cancelling their trips over the incident			1
@entity56 @entity57 manager @entity45 standing in front of one of six sperm whales washed up dead in a rare mass stranding on the @entity2 coast @entity64 mayor @entity63 predicted it could cost up to $ 50,000 to remove the whales , as well as assistance from local businesses			1
' we 're trying to use the ingenuity of local staff seeing as we do n't appear to be getting much assistance at all from the @entity73 who actually said they have n't got anything that can handle it , ' he told @entity47			2
six of the whales were found on about six kilometres south of @entity40 , while the seventh was found by a jetty			2
@entity46 regional co-ordinator @entity81 told @entity82 that an eighth whale was found in a deeply distressed state			0
' @entity86 staff and a @entity88 officer located a live seven - metre sperm whale in 1.5 metres of water at @entity91 , ' regional co-ordinator he said			2
@entity94 mayor @entity63 has now said the repulsive odour from the whales has left the council no choice but to remove the carcasses ' the animal was very lethargic but after some time they managed to encourage it out into deeper water where it dived and they have n't seen it since			1
they will remain in the area to confirm it does n't come into the shallows again			0
' experts believe that there could be many explanations as to why the whales got into trouble			2
one such theory is that one of the whales was sick and went into shallow water , when it felt better it may have called for help from the rest of the pod			2
another explanation may be that the pod were chasing food and got caught in the low tide			0
the whales were found 50m offshore at @entity126 , about 4km south of @entity9 @entity46 animal welfare manager dr @entity127 was distressed to see the whales on the beach			0
' this is rare , ' dr @entity45 said			0
' unfortunately things like this have been happening for thousands of years			0
' the witness said that one of the whales was still flapping it 's tail this morning at 8am , but stopped a short while later			0
the @entity138 say male sperm whales can grow up to 60 feet and may live to be 50 - 70 - years - old			1
they say that while sperm whales typically die of natural causes , they are known to mass strand			1
mr @entity63 predicts it could cost up to $ 50,000 to remove the whales , as well as assistance from local businesses			1

seven sperm whales were washed ashore in @entity2 this week
the odour from the whales has been discouraging tourism
mayor @entity63 said the council need to remove the whales
he predicts it could cost $ 50,000 and the help of local businesses
it is still *uncertain* what caused the mass death of the animals
