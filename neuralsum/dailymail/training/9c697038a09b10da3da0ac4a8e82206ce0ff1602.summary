millions of holidaymakers who endure long flight delays will now receive compensation following landmark court rulings yesterday			1

‘ @entity35 will be made to face up to their legal responsibility and pay out fair compensation to those who have suffered			1
' we ’d expect hundreds of thousands of people to now come forward and make a claim			1

the exception is if the delay is caused by a so - called ‘ extraordinary circumstance ’ such as bad weather , industrial action or a bird hitting a plane			2
airlines have been accused of repeatedly exploiting this rule to wriggle out of paying legitimate claims			1
they have argued that delays caused by technical faults also count as extraordinary circumstances beyond their control			0
this frees them from any obligation to pay			0
holidaymakers who had claims rejected on these grounds took the airlines to the small claims courts and then to the @entity85			1
@entity52 , 58 , from @entity86 , was refused compensation by @entity48 following a 27 - hour delay when travelling with his wife and granddaughter from @entity91 to @entity92 in 2011			1
@entity93 @entity94 , 41 , of @entity95 , can keep the £ 975 plus interest ( a total of £ 1,488.73 ) that he was awarded from @entity15 after his flight with his wife from @entity100 to the @entity101 on christmas day 2006 was delayed six hours 26 minutes			1
@entity15 appealed the order for payment made by judge @entity104 at @entity105 on the grounds that it was outside the two year limitation period for claims under the 1999 @entity110			1
but lord justice @entity111 unanimously agreed that claims can be made up to six years after the event under @entity58 law , and that mr @entity94 was just inside that limit			1
@entity116 says decision affects more than 11m passengers			0
@entity120 @entity119 @entity52 , 58 , of @entity86 , won his battle with @entity48 after his flight from @entity91 to @entity92 in 2011 was delayed for 27 hours			2
the airline claimed a technical fault was ' unforeseeable ' and they should n't have to pay compensation			1
but the judges ruled the fault was not an ' extraordinary circumstance ' and they must pay			0
after his victory mr @entity52 said : ' i am absolutely delighted with the decision			0
after everything i have been through to get to this point it 's a fantastic day			0
' i always hoped that we would get a positive outcome and it 's nice to get to this milestone			0
the result in my favour should help passengers throughout the country who have experienced similar difficulties to me			0
' the delay was caused by a wiring defect			0
@entity146 and then the @entity85 both ruled in his favour			0
in july , @entity48 appealed against this ruling – this time to the @entity8			2

‘ @entity48 has fought tooth and nail to take my case this far but i think they deserve to lose after everything they have put me through			0
‘ i ’m delighted not just for myself but for everyone else they have treated in this way			0
’ a separate ruling by the @entity8 means that passengers will now be able to claim for delays dating back six years			2
@entity94 , 41 , took @entity15 to @entity105 after his compensation claim for a six - and - a - half - hour delay was rejected by the airline because it was more than two years old			1
mr @entity94 – who was stuck at @entity100 before flying to the @entity101 in 2006 – won cases in the county court and the @entity85			0
yesterday the @entity8 rejected @entity15 ’s request to appeal			1
mr @entity94 , from @entity95 , has now received £ 975 in compensation plus interest totalling £ 1,488.73			0
experts predict these victories will open the floodgates for claims from passengers who suffer delays in the future			2
@entity195 , chief executive of watchdog the @entity197 , said : ‘ where airlines have put claims on hold , the @entity197 expects airlines to revisit them and pay compensation for any eligible claims			1
’ a spokesman for @entity15 said : ‘ we are surprised and disappointed to note the decision of the @entity8 as we believe our position is sound in law			1
' we will now review this position based on the court ’s decision			0

@entity13 and @entity15 lose appeals against passenger delay compensation
two families were left stranded for total of *33* hours and took them to court
airlines tried to *overturn* compensation rulings at @entity8 but failed
rulings mean thousands more who have made claims likely to be paid
experts believe that millions of people may be able to sue tardy airline
