a landlord has been fined for letting a £ 420 - a - month flat whose tenants had to crawl up a tiny staircase to get inside			1
@entity4 continued charging for the flat in @entity6 , north @entity7 , for more than a year after council officers banned him from doing so - saying the 2ft 4ins of headroom was a fire risk			1
now @entity4 has been made to pay more than £ 3,000 in fines and costs after he pleaded guilty in court to breaching planning regulations			2
the staircase 's headroom ranged from 3ft 11ins down to 2ft 4ins , not even high enough for a toddler to negotiate standing upright			0
the door to the loft room was also reduced in size , a @entity32 spokesman said			0
council officers served @entity4 , 60 , with a prohibition order in february 2012 which stopped him using the room for accommodation			1
leave your shoes at the door : council officers said the flat could be a death trap if a fire were to break out but he was hauled before the courts after officials visited the house with police in september last year and found the room was still being rented by a couple for £ 420 a month			1
@entity4 , who lives in the same street in @entity6 , pleaded guilty on august 5 to failing to comply with an order served by the council prohibiting occupation of the loft room			2

council officers in the upmarket borough of @entity97 , north @entity7 , found the flat breached planning regulations because it was too cramped			1
