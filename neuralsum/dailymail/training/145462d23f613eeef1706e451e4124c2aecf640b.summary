the 25 - year - old , who would be eligible to play for either @entity10 or @entity2 , had considered not playing at all to avoid upsetting people			1
but he has now said he has made his decision ahead of this week 's @entity13 at @entity14			1
@entity1 ( pictured on sunday ) has announced he will represent @entity2 at the @entity15 in @entity4 ' i ’ve been thinking about it a lot , ' he told a pre-tournament press conference			2
' i do n’t know whether it ’s been because the @entity21 has been in @entity4 and i ’ve been thinking a couple of years down the line			0
' thinking about all the times that i played as an amateur for @entity2 and as a boy and everything , i think for me it ’s the right decision to play for @entity2 in 2016			2
' the @entity30 golfer is catholic by birth , but is not believed to be particularly religious , and comes from the predominantly @entity34 @entity33 area of @entity35			1
he has previously spoken of being in an ' extremely sensitive and difficult position ' over the decision , releasing an open letter on his @entity40 account in september 2012 in response to quotes attributed to him which said he felt ' more @entity46 than @entity30 '			1
asked if he had been ' torn ' on the issue , the former world number one said today : ' more worried about what other people would think , rather than me			0
but you ’ve got to do what ’s right for yourself and what you feel most comfortable with , and ultimately that was the decision that i made			2
@entity1 ( pictured last month ) , who would be eligible to play for either @entity10 or @entity2 , had considered not playing at all to avoid upsetting people ' i was always very proud to put on the @entity30 uniform and play as an amateur and as a boy , and i would be very proud to do it again			1
' just because now that i ’m playing golf for money and i ’m a professional , i ’m supposed to have this choice or this decision to make , where if you look at the rugby players , you look at cricketers or hockey players , they view @entity2 as one , the same as we do in golf			2
' i do n’t think there ’s any point to change that or go against that just because it ’s a different event or it ’s the @entity78			0
' i ’ve had a lot of time on my own the last few weeks and just been thinking about it a lot			2
it ’s something that ’s been quite important to me and something that i needed to make some sort of decision or some sort of stand on it			0
changes : @entity91 's decision to represent @entity2 comes just weeks after he announced he had broken off his engagement to tennis player @entity93 , 23 ( right ) ' just weighing up everything , and thinking back about the times that i played for @entity2 and won the @entity97 championship with @entity2 , won a lot of great amateur titles representing @entity2 , i just thought why change that ? basically it ’s just a continuation of what i ’ve always done			1
' @entity91 's decision to represent @entity2 comes just weeks after he announced he had broken off his engagement to tennis player @entity93 , 23 , saying he had realised he was not prepared for ' all that marriage entails '			1
