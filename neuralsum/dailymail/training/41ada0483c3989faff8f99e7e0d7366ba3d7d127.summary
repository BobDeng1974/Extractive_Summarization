by @entity0 published : 21:50 est , 15 october 2012 updated : 07:52 est , 16 october 2012 a @entity2 couple has filed for bankruptcy just eight years after winning a $ 20 million lawsuit against the makers of a butter popcorn flavoring that gave one of them lung disease			1
@entity10 of @entity11 and his wife , @entity12 , sued @entity13 and @entity14 in 2004 after mr @entity10 developed bronchiolitis obliterans while working at a popcorn plant in @entity17			1
but just eight years later , the two are being forced to sell the home they built for $ 3.9 million to pay off creditors , after their financial situation went spectacularly downhill			1
popcorn couple : @entity10 , pictured right with wife @entity12 , have filed for bankruptcy after winning a $ 20 million verdict against the makers of a butter popcorn flavouring in 2004 according to the @entity28 , the @entity27 listed the current value of their residence and 10.5 acres of land at just $ 700,000 and personal property assets of nearly $ 33,000			1
but their liabilities are listed at more than $ 611,000 , including a $ 482,876 mortgage with @entity35			0
the couple 's case against the butter flavouring companies was the first of several brought by workers and their spouses			1
the suit claimed @entity43 , who has two children with his wife , developed the lung disease after being exposed to diacetyl , a chemical present in the flavouring to give a buttery taste and aroma			1
researchers have found that , when heated , the chemical produces a toxic , potentially lethal gas , and can leave those exposed with a shortness of breath , a dry cough and wheezing			0
at the trial , doctors testified that @entity10 would eventually need a double - lung transplant			2
losing their home : the couple are being forced to sell the @entity11 home , pictured , they spent $ 3.9 million on drop : the @entity27 listed the current value of their residence , pictured , and 10.5 acres of land at just $ 700,000 opulent : pictures show the grand entryway to the home , which took five years to build a @entity76 jury awarded @entity10 $ 18 million and his wife $ 2 million			1
it has never been revealed exactly how much of that verdict money the couple received			0
mr @entity10 said at the time that his attorney 's firm would take 35 per cent of the pay out , and their attorney , @entity82 , suggested a portion would be spread among other workers involved in the lawsuits			2
though it is not clear how they spent the remaining millions , purchases include two @entity89 automobiles , a @entity90 and a @entity91			0
other personal property listed in court documents include a bedroom set , dryer , end tables , china , lamps , a vcr , a microwave oven and $ 50 worth of camera equipment , @entity92 reported			2
since winning the lawsuit , @entity103 has also been employed by @entity105 as a realtor			0
social networking sites also indicate she helps run @entity108 in @entity109 , @entity2			2
struggle : @entity10 , pictured left in 2007 in front of the @entity17 popcorn plant and right with his wife at the wedding of their daughter , has suffered ill health since working for the company but among the unsecured claims the couple list in their bankruptcy petition is a november 1 , 2011 , judgment in @entity124 to @entity125 , the contractor who built their home over a five - year period			1
he sued them in august 2011 , claiming they still owed him $ 107,147			2
the couple failed to respond to the lawsuit in a timely manner , and a judge granted mr @entity125 a default judgment at an annual interest rate of 9 per cent			0
the couple filed a motion last december asking the judge to set aside the default judgment because of difficulties , including a downturn in mr @entity43 ' health			0
their motion also asserted a basis for a counterclaim against mr @entity125 because they said the house initially was estimated to cost $ 400,000 , but skyrocketed to more than $ 3.9 million			1
neither the @entity27 ' motion nor the bankruptcy petition explains the $ 3.2 million difference between what they claimed to have paid to build the home and what they say the property is worth now			1
popcorn lung , also known as bronchiolitis obliterans , may be caused by inhalation of airborne diacetyl , a chemical used to produce the butter - like flavoring in microwaveable popcorn			2
when the chemical is heated , it produces a toxic , potentially fatal gas , researchers believe			0
the non-reversible disease affects the bronchioles - small airway branches in the lungs - which become narrowed by scar tissue and inflammation			0
it causes dry cough , shortness of breath and wheezing , and can lead to the need for lung transplants			0
it first came to public attention when eight former employees of the @entity186 - @entity185 popcorn plant in @entity17 , @entity2 , developed bronchiolitis obliterans in the late 1990s			1
in 2000 , the @entity2 @entity188 called in @entity189 ( @entity190 ) to make a determination of the cause , and to recommend safety measures			0
after surveying the plant and each patient 's medical history , @entity190 recommended respiratory protection for all workers in microwave popcorn production in september , a court awarded @entity201 , 59 , from @entity202 , @entity203 $ 7.2 million after he developed the condition from eating three packs of the snack each day			1
jurors agreed that the popcorn manufacturer and the supermarket chain that sold it were negligent by failing to warn on labels that the butter flavoring , diacetyl , was dangerous .			0

popcorn factory worker @entity10 and wife @entity12 won the *multimillion* *dollar* payout in 2004
sued the makers of a toxic butter flavouring after he developed lung disease
the couple paid $ 3.9 million to build a mansion in @entity11 , @entity2
eight years later , they have filed for bankruptcy , claiming the residence and 10.5 acres of land are now worth just $ 700,000
