@entity1 bosses have said they are ' firmly committed ' to building the world 's biggest rocket to take man to @entity5			1
despite worries over the space agencies ability to pay for the project , officials said they have completed a rigorous review of the @entity11 ( @entity11 )			2
towering a staggering 384 feet tall , the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) will provide 9.2 million pounds of thrust at liftoff and weigh 6.5 million pounds			1
the @entity23 issued a report wednesday saying @entity25 's @entity11 is at ' high risk of missing ' its planned december 2017 initial test flight			1
' they ca n't meet the date with the money they have , ' report author @entity28 said			0
she said it was n't because the space agency had technical problems with the congressionally - required program , but that @entity1 did n't get enough money to carry out the massive undertaking			1
' we are on a journey of scientific and human exploration that leads to @entity5 , ' said @entity1 administrator @entity40			2
' and we ’re firmly committed to building the launch vehicle and other supporting systems that will take us on that journey			0
' for its first flight test , @entity11 will be configured for a 70 - metric - ton ( 77 - ton ) lift capacity and carry an uncrewed @entity47 spacecraft beyond low - earth orbit			1
in its most powerful configuration , @entity11 will provide an unprecedented lift capability of 130 metric tons ( 143 tons ) , which will enable missions even farther into our solar system , including such destinations as an asteroid and @entity5			2
this decision comes after a thorough review known as @entity57 ( @entity58 - c ) , which provides a development cost baseline for the 70 - metric ton version of the @entity11 of $ 7.021 billion from february 2014 through the first launch and a launch readiness schedule based on an initial @entity11 flight no later than november 2018			1
conservative cost and schedule commitments outlined in the @entity67 align the @entity11 program with program management best practices that account for potential technical risks and budgetary uncertainty beyond the program 's control			2
' our nation is embarked on an ambitious space exploration program , and we owe it to the @entity79 taxpayers to get it right , ' said associate administrator @entity80 , who oversaw the review process			0
' after rigorous review , we ’re committing today to a funding level and readiness date that will keep us on track to sending humans to @entity5 in the 2030s – and we ’re going to stand behind that commitment			0
' the biggest rocket ever made : the @entity11 will be 384 feet tall and weigh 6.5 million pounds ' the @entity90 has done exemplary work during the past three years to get us to this point , ' said @entity94 , associate administrator for the @entity95 at @entity96 in @entity97			1
' we will keep the teams working toward a more ambitious readiness date , but will be ready no later than november 2018			0
' @entity1 has been testing small scale versions of the rocket amid fears it could be too loud			1
four sls rs - 25 engines will be used to power the world 's biggest rocket into orbit			2
' a 5 - percent scale model , including solid rocket motors , of @entity96 's @entity11 ( @entity11 ) is ignited to test how low - and high - frequency sound waves will affect the rocket on the launch pad , ' the agency said			1
' the data collected from the tests will be used to help direct and verify the design of the rocket 's sound suppression system			1
' previous tests have shown that most ofthe acoustic energy being emitted from a rocket engines is concentrated in the low to mid frequency ranges			0
' this may have the potential to damage structures or harm personnel in the immediate vicinity of the test stand			0
' a @entity1 report warned			2
the sls is set to become the largest rocket ever built , dwarfing the rockets that took man to the moon and paving the way for manned missions to @entity5			0
@entity1 today said it is about to start testing the engines for the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) rocket - on the same stand that were used to perfect the @entity139 rockets			1
four engines , a modified version of the space shuttle main engine that powered missions into space from 1981 to 2011 , will be used on the mega-rocket			0
' this test series is a major milestone because it will be our first opportunity to operate the engine with a new controller and to test propellant inlet conditions for sls that are different than the space shuttle , ' said @entity152 , @entity153 manager			0
earlier this year @entity1 signed a $ 2.8 billion contract with @entity155 to build the giant rocket it is hoped will take us into deep space			2
how it compares : the sls is larger than the @entity160 rockets than launched man to the @entity162			0
it will also be more powerful than any rocket in operation today			0
@entity166 's super-rocket design has yet to be unveiled			0
however construction of the first stage of @entity166 's super-rocket - capable of lifting 80 tonnes - is already underway the pieces that make up @entity1 's mega-rocket in its first configuration			1

rocket will be 384 feet tall and weigh 6.5 million pounds
will have sound suppression system *installed* to cut noise to safe levels
first test flight scheduled for 2017 - but could slip to 2018
