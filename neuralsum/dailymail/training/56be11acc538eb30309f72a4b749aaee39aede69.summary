by @entity0 it has been a summer of bank breaking transfers			0
at almost all of @entity6 's major clubs , there has been a changing of the guard , and an expensive one too			0
@entity9 have shelled out £ 75million for @entity10 , @entity11 over £ 80million for @entity12 and @entity13 , and @entity14 and @entity15 have spent millions plundering @entity16			1
in all the commotion , only @entity17 have remained quiet			2
and yet , in @entity20 , they appear to have pulled off the coup of the year			2
the former @entity15 striker brings his baggage but at the same time undisputed quality , and with @entity40 departing the @entity41 for @entity42 , he 'll provide timely assists and goals when he returns in november from his four - month ban for biting @entity46			0
however , it was most certainly a surprise to see their arch - rivals spend £ 63million on @entity12			1
granted , he had a superb @entity29 with @entity52 and was one of , if not the player of the tournament			0
but with the plethora of attacking options at @entity60 's disposal including the likes of @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 , there is no guarantee the former @entity67 striker will be guaranteed of much first - team football at the @entity69			2
pedigree : the 25 - year - old was outstanding for @entity72 during a four - year spell bearing in mind @entity11 won the @entity76 and @entity77 last season , it could be seen that the signing of @entity12 is more a signal of intent to sent out to their rivals , rather than one that was a necessity			1
so with that all mind @entity17 could have come out of this with the top trump - that in being @entity20 on a free transfer			1
the 25 - year - old had four prolific years at @entity72 and after rejecting their offer of a new contract in january , @entity17 finally had their man after a four - year hunt			2
after a league and cup double in @entity98 's first season at the club @entity17 could have been forgiven for letting their foot off the gas and sticking put with what they already have , but their capture of @entity20 signals a real statement of intent and at a bargain price			1
prolific : @entity20 has been a success on the international stage as well as domestically @entity98 was clearly enchanted with @entity20			0
he said : ' he is a top , top player			0
he 's just got everything			0
congratulations to @entity17 for signing him ! ' £ 75m - @entity10 ( @entity15 to @entity9 ) £ 60m - @entity12 ( @entity67 to @entity11 ) £ 50m - @entity112 ( @entity113 to @entity114 ) £ 32m - @entity115 ( @entity116 to @entity113 ) £ 30m - @entity117 ( @entity16 to @entity14 ) £ 30m - @entity40 ( @entity9 to @entity42 ) free - @entity20 ( @entity72 to @entity17 ) congratulations are indeed in order			1
@entity17 had spent the best part of three years trying to prise @entity20 away from @entity72 , and in the end they played their hand expertly			1
it could prove to be one of the greatest bargains in @entity17 's history			1
at 25 , @entity20 arrives in @entity127 with his prime years right in front of him			0
more importantly , though , @entity20 is @entity98 's man			1
the @entity130 's attitude to the striker is in stark contrast to his relationship with the @entity20 's predecessor , @entity134			1
as many players have found to their chagrin over the years , a clash of egos with @entity98 can see anyone frozen out of a team			0
@entity14 : @entity20 and his teammates celebrate his goal against @entity22 on sunday @entity134 fell out of favour last season , with the player not even travelling to @entity146 to celebrate @entity17 winning the @entity147			1
the @entity149 's style of play was also less suited to @entity98 's philosophy			0
a surprising amount of @entity17 's goals last season came from crosses , set pieces and headers			2
at times , they looked muted when trying to pass through the gaps of their opposition			0
@entity20 will add a dynamism to that forward play which @entity134 lacked			0
@entity20 , it would seem , is one of the last , crucial pieces in the @entity98 's jigsaw .			2

the new @entity17 striker appears to be a very *shrewd* *acquisition*
@entity9 and @entity11 have spent £ 75m and £ 63m on @entity10 and @entity12 respectively
but @entity20 's free transfer to @entity17 looks to be the bargain deal of the summer
