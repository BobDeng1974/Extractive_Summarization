@entity0 was upstaged by a six - year - old school girl today after trying to unveil a new @entity3 education policy			1
the prime minister visited a primary school near @entity6 to unveil the party 's latest proposal to improve education standards , after announcing that under a future @entity3 government children who achieve poor @entity13 results will be forced to resit them in secondary school			1
as mr @entity0 tried to help school pupil @entity15 read a story about ' prince @entity17 ' the youngster pulled a series of funny faces before resting her head on the table after struggling with a tricky passage			1
mr @entity0 had planned to use the classroom visit to unveil his plan , which he said was intended to inject ' more rigour and zero tolerance of failure and mediocrity ' in schools			1
the resit plan would mean 100,000 pupils taking a new test in @entity51 and maths during their first year after leaving primary school			1
the proposal would be implemented next year and is aimed at making sure that pupils have not already fallen too far behind at the beginning of secondary school			1
pupils who did not get good grades in the @entity13 tests taken by 11 - year - olds in primary school would have to retake a test during their first year after moving up to secondary school			1
in last year 's tests , 79 per cent of pupils achieved the expected grades in reading , writing and maths			2
the @entity3 claim that , too often , pupils who have slipped behind by this stage never catch up			2
among those who fail to make the grade at the age of 11 , they say only 7 % go on to get five good gcses , including @entity51 and maths			0
children would be forced to retake a test in maths and @entity51 , marked by teachers rather than external examiners			0
there could be up to two retakes , in the spring or summer terms , and the number of pupils who had failed the retakes would be published as part of the league table data			0
the @entity4 made the announcement in @entity92 today with the education secretary @entity93 ( centre ) mr @entity0 chatted with pupils outside at the @entity30 @entity36 near @entity6 pupils with special needs would not have to take the resits			1
mr @entity0 said : ' there is no job that does n't require @entity51 and maths , and this is about making sure every child gets the best start in life and that our country can compete in the world			1
' education secretary @entity93 added : ' we know that the biggest predictor of success at @entity112 is whether young people have mastered the basics at age 11			0
that means if we fail to get it right for young people at the start of secondary school they 'll struggle for the rest of their time in education			1
' @entity125 's shadow education secretary @entity124 dismissed the proposal as ' desperate ' @entity125 's shadow education secretary @entity124 said dismissed the announcement as a ' a desperate attempt by the @entity3 to try to overshadow their failures on school standards '			2
mr @entity124 said : ' on their watch , 1.6 million pupils are being educated in schools that are rated lower than ' good ' by @entity135			2
and as a result of @entity0 's unqualified teachers policy , more than 400,000 pupils are being taught by unqualified teachers			2
' @entity125 has a better plan for education			0
we will ensure that every teacher is qualified or working towards qualified teacher status and introduce a new master teacher status to raise the standing of the profession			0
that is how we improve education for every child , in every classroom , ' he said			0
the @entity153 dem schools minister @entity152 said the @entity3 had ' no credibility ' on education because of their planned spending cuts after the election			2
he said : ' you simply ca n't improve schools by starving them of resources and burdening them with the bureaucracy of additional testing			0
' the way to make sure every child starts secondary school achieving a good level of @entity167 and @entity51 is to invest in their early years and primary education , recruiting great teachers and getting extra support to the children who most need it			1
' that 's why we need to protect the education budget , in real terms , including schools , nurseries and colleges			0
' the @entity3 are trying to paper over the cracks in their scorched earth education plans that would undo the progress of the last five years			0
' @entity186 , deputy general secretary of the @entity188 union , warned the tests could become a bureaucratic nightmare			0
he said : ' it is important that the results of these tests are diagnostic and used to support the work of the teachers and do not become yet another performance indicator on which to measure schools			0
