by @entity0 the @entity1 is using a sensitive police database nearly 1,500 times a year under a deal giving it privileged access to criminal records			1
the animal welfare charity is using the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) an average of 124 times every month in relation to prosecutions it brings			0
the scale of its activity raised concerns yesterday as the records are usually regarded as so sensitive that employers – even in the public sector and involved in working with children – do not have access to them			0
sensitive material : the @entity1 can request information about the criminal records of suspects , witnesses , defendants and victims critics accuse the charity of increasing ‘ militancy ’ by focusing on expensive political stunts and strong - arm tactics at the expense of its core mission to protect animals			1
information commissioner @entity39 is to investigate the deal struck in 2010 between the police and the @entity1			1
under the agreement with the @entity43 ( @entity43 ) , a private company , the @entity1 can request a criminal record check , paying @entity43 at least £ 35 per search			1
last night @entity47 mp @entity46 , former head of the @entity48 , said : ‘ if any other political organisation had access to the @entity8 there would be widespread public concern			1
‘ this is an increasingly politically driven animal rights group which is a shadow of its welfare origins			1
i will be writing to the home secretary and attorney general to seek clarity as to whether any pressure group can have similar access			2
’ the deal allows the @entity1 to request information about the criminal records of suspects , witnesses , defendants and victims			1
in one 19 - month period it made 54 of these detailed checks on the @entity8 , which would reveal any convictions , cautions , warnings , reprimands and impending prosecutions			0
but the bulk of its use of the @entity8 came as @entity1 officials created fresh records on the database of their own suspects			2
during the same 19 - month period the charity added 2,311 records of people it intended to prosecute so that their data could be seen by police			0
other organisations holding agreements with @entity43 are state bodies such as the @entity87 and the @entity88			0
the @entity1 , which yesterday revealed that it secured 4,168 animal welfare and cruelty convictions last year , up from 2,441 three years ago , claims it accesses the computer to update records of its prosecutions			2
but it has been severely criticised in recent months for being too aggressive in prosecutions and campaigns			0
a @entity97 councillor who served as election agent for @entity99 , a pro-hunting mp , was prosecuted for unlawful hunting , but the case was dropped at the 11th hour			0
a judge criticised the animal charity for bringing the prosecution even though nobody had seen a fox			0
sir @entity107 , who heads the @entity48 , called for the @entity1 ’s access to police files to be stopped until it is proved lawful			2
animal rights : the @entity1 has been accused by critics of becoming increasingly political and militant he said : ‘ the @entity1 is neither a public body nor a statutory prosecuting force , it is a campaigning charity with an increasingly militant animal rights agenda			1
‘ the disclosure of highly personal information held on police databases to the organisation could pose significant risks to the individual concerned			0
’ an @entity1 spokesman said the charity requests information from the police to ‘ prevent and detect ’ serious animal - related crime			1
she added : ‘ any response from the police is at their discretion and will be proportionate to the request made			0
’ an @entity43 spokesman said the charity has ‘ indirect ’ access , which does not include firearms licensing , vehicle registrations or information unrelated to particular prosecutions .			2

critics accuse the @entity1 of increasing ‘ militancy ’
under current agreement it can pay for criminal record checks
@entity47 mp @entity46 said it is an ' increasingly politically driven ' group
