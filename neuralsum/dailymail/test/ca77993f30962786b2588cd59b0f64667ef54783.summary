an adaptor that allows colour blind people to enjoy tv without a loss of detail is seeking funding on @entity6			1
called @entity8 , it adjusts colours in the image so that shows look ' normal ' , even if features colours such as red and green that would otherwise not be visible			0
and the subtle effect is such that someone with normal vision will barely notice any change in the picture , so people can easily watch tv together			0
@entity8 can be plugged into any @entity28 port on a tv or a computer monitor ( shown in illustration )			1
a remote control or app then adjusts the colour adjustment			1
it allows colour blind people to watch shows they otherwise could n't the team from the @entity37 in @entity24 is seeking £ 100,000 ( $ 150,000 ) of funding to get their project of the ground			1
at the moment you can buy a single adaptor with a @entity45 remote control for £ 50 ( $ 75 ) , with shipping expected in may 2016			1
the device uses a patented @entity49 algorithm to automatically adjust the picture , with a variety of settings available until optimal picture quality is found			0
the video is enhanced on a frame - by - frame basis through @entity57 's patented @entity49 image enhancement technology , offering a dramatically improved viewing experience			0
the picture quality can be adjusted via remote control to suit the unique colour - vision of the individual viewer			1
to make the effect work , they created a small gadget that plugs into the @entity28 port of a tv or monitor			1
you then plug another device into the adaptor and , using an app or remote , adjust the colour settings on whatever you are watching			2
it works with any hd - ready screen , such as a tv or a computer monitor			1
it charges using a usb cable , which can be plugged into a spare usb port or into a plug			0
and the goal is to enable people of all sight levels to enjoy shows			0
at the moment , more than 90 per cent of forms of colour blindness are supported			2
around four per cent of the world 's population suffers from colour blindness			2
their viewing experience is particularly affected when watching particular content types			0
for example , it can be difficult to tell sports teams apart , particularly if one is playing in red and the other in green , while programmes about wildlife , cookery and art are severely impacted			0
' a 2014 @entity104 football match between an all red and an all green football team [ @entity106 and @entity107 ] was unwatchable for colour blind fans , ' explained @entity109 , managing director of @entity57 , the spin - off company of the university developing the product			0
but with @entity8 , the same match could have been watched by people who were colour blind and not alike			2
the team also says nature shows are difficult to watch , as they often mix colours that are indistinguishable to people who are colour blind			1
a @entity104 football match between @entity106 and @entity107 on 16 september 2014 ( pictured ) was criticised because the teams played in red and green , making it difficult from people who suffered from colour blindness to watch the match with @entity8 , the same match could have been watched by people who were colour blind and not alike			1
on the left is the regular version , while on the right is the subtle changes made by the @entity49 algorithm another example is shown here , with the regular spider on the left and an enhanced version right playing video games which feature predominantly red or green characters and those with subtle colour differences between good guys and monsters is also difficult			0
' the inability to enjoy watching tv or to play video games alongside friends and family is a major frustration to those suffering from colour blindness , significantly impacting their quality of life , ' added mr @entity109			2
' our image enhancement technology is proven to solve this major accessibility issue , and the @entity8 adapter is poised to transform how colour blind people , and their families , watch tv and video content			1
' by launching the project on @entity6 we can accelerate bringing our technology to the consumer electronics market , giving those with colour blindness the chance to become early adopters and improve their viewing experience			0
' the company also has an app that is available , enabling people to view content on their smartphone or tablet that they would otherwise not be able to see .			0

@entity24 scientists have developed a £ 50 adaptor for colour blindness
it can be plugged into any @entity28 port on a tv or a computer monitor
a remote control or app then adjusts the colour adjustment
it allows colour blind people to watch shows they otherwise could n't
