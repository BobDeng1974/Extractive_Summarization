@entity0 has made a confused , faltering , ego - stricken start to his stint as @entity4 chairman but he has taken a positive step in the right direction with proposals aimed at bringing more and better youngsters to the aid of @entity11 ’s ailing national team			1
stricter limitations on foreign imports and a prohibition against the big clubs signing players by the bucket - load and immediately farming them out on loan would create @entity20 opportunities for home - grown talent			1
a pity , then , that this initiative has coincided with a faltering start to the @entity25 by @entity11 ’s leading clubs			1
per @entity27 and @entity28 hold their heads after @entity32 's defeat by @entity33 with @entity32 and @entity34 losing at @entity33 and @entity35 respectively and @entity36 held at home by @entity38 , our only winners this midweek were @entity42			2
and they needed a last - gasp penalty from @entity45 to struggle past a team nobody here had heard of until last month and whose name few of us can pronounce			2
these ragged showings are likely to set up another raft of over-priced buys from abroad when that transfer window creaks open again in january			1
even if their euro - results improve in the meantime , they have been warned as to how difficult the @entity59 will be to beat when it comes to the sharp end of the @entity25 in the new year			1
since the answer to that threat will not be to bring on young @entity65 talent , do not expect the @entity20 to be encouraged by its biggest paymasters to accede to @entity0 ’s reforms			1
do not expect , for example , @entity36 to be forced to rein back on their 26 – yes , 26 – players currently being borrowed by other clubs here and on the continent			1
@entity0 made a pompous ass of himself when he declared that @entity11 would not bid for any future @entity74 while @entity75 is still president of @entity76 but he is right to highlight the abuse of @entity79 ’s transfer system			1
but is it likely to make much difference ? not while the giant clubs effectively run our national game for their own selfish ends			1
@entity86 ( left ) , @entity87 and @entity88 ( right ) after @entity34 's loss at @entity35 @entity90 , the universal language @entity92 admits ‘ it would have been a paradox ’ if @entity32 had taken their couple of half chances in @entity33 and deprived @entity33 of a deserved victory			2
you have to love him , managing in his second language as he does			2
@entity92 is stoney - faced as @entity32 are beaten in @entity33 @entity100 , @entity75 knows home nations back him on tv referrals it seems that fooball was the only element of the @entity106 in a win - win situation as @entity108 voted on the independence referendum			2
if we are waking up to a yes on friday morning , it will be an end to the pressure from the wider football world for @entity106 , @entity11 included , to field a combined team in @entity116			0
if it ’s no , @entity76 president @entity75 will reinforce the position of the four home associations on the @entity121 which rules on the regulations of the game			0
he knows he has the support of the @entity65 , @entity108 , @entity125 and @entity126 for the introduction of tv referrals of disputed decisions during matches			1
@entity131 's a goner from @entity134 - @entity133 could be next there are still 14 weeks to @entity136 but @entity137 has gone from @entity134 and @entity138 from @entity139 already			0
can @entity140 ’s @entity133 be far behind ? not that we should shed too many tears			0
these days the pay - off to a failed football manager amounts to more than the average fan earns in a lifetime			0
@entity137 has left as @entity134 manager with the season only a month old starter for 10 - who was @entity150 's toughest opponent twenty - one years after his premature death the legacy of @entity152 grows ever stronger , not least through the raising of millions of pounds to help fight the bowel cancer which killed the only @entity11 captain ever to raise the @entity74 aloft			0
driven by the unstinting commitment of his widow @entity159 , the @entity157 has now surpassed £ 20million			0
that figure will grow significantly this november when the most lucrative annual event in the @entity157 ’s calendar takes place in @entity165			0
@entity152 in two iconic poses , lifting the @entity74 ( left ) and being embraced by @entity150 in 1970 the @entity167 – as it says on the label – features a host of famous football and sports figures who , buoyed by a champagne reception and a lavish dinner , attempt to answer a raft of fiendish questions			0
this is the starter for 10 which everyone gets right : who does @entity150 describe as the greatest defender he ever played against ? this is how to answer yes to the question of whether you would like to pit your wits against the stars on the evening of november 13 at @entity188 , @entity189 , @entity165 @entity190 : call 02034695307 or email @entity191			0
