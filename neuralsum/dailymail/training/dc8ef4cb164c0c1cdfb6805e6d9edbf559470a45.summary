the number of wild animals , fish and birds in the world has plummeted by almost a third in 40 years because of man ’s plundering of natural resources , conservationists have warned			1
the tracking of the fate of more than 2,500 species of mammals , birds , reptiles , amphibians and fish reveals a planet in peril			1
those in crisis range from tigers – whose numbers are at an all - time low – to river dolphins , some which may already have been driven out of existence			2
the @entity28 claims that the @entity30 ’s capacity for supporting life is being outstripped at such a rate that we will need the equivalent of a second planet to meet our needs by 2030			1
by 2050 , close to three planets would be needed to maintain man ’s current standard of living			2
the stark picture is painted by the @entity28 in its two - yearly survey of the @entity30 ’s health			1
working with @entity44 , it has calculated the world ’s wildlife population fell by 30 per cent between 1970 and 2008 – the latest year for which data is available			1
declines are even more dramatic in some regions , with numbers of tropical species falling by 60 per cent over four decades			0
and populations of birds , animals and fish that make their home in freshwater have tumbled by 70 per cent in the same time frame , the @entity53 report warns			1
@entity62 creatures sliding towards extinction include river - dwelling dolphins and porpoises			0
as residents of some of the world ’s largest rivers , including the @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 , they face a daily danger from dams , fishing nets , boats and pollution			0
oblivion : the @entity81 , which experts fear may already be extinct , is among the series of species that are on the brink , according to new research one species , the @entity81 , may already be extinct			0
the tiger ’s future is also in jeopardy , with numbers across @entity91 down 70 per cent since 1980			1
forced to compete for space in densely - populated regions , it roams just 7 per cent of the area it once did			0
in @entity99 , populations of hippos have been hit by the expansion of agriculture , abstraction of water and hunting for meat and ivory			0
numbers in the @entity107 fell by 95 per cent between 1960 and 2003			2
under threat : the hippopotamus population in the @entity107 is down by 95 per cent and is among the species that experts warn face oblivion closer to home , overfishing is blamed for populations of @entity117 cod falling by 74 per cent in the past 50 years			2
the report warns that people , and particularly rich nations , are exploiting resources such as water , forests and fisheries at a much higher rate than they can be replenished			0
@entity126 , of the @entity128 arm of the @entity28 , said : ‘ if we continue to use up our planet ’s resources faster than it can replace them , soon we ’ll have exploited every available corner of the @entity30			1
’ @entity135 , the @entity137 ’s conservation programme director , added : ‘ we can restore the planet ’s health but only through addressing the root causes – population growth and over-consumption of resources			0
’ on the brink : overfishing is blamed for populations of @entity117 cod falling by 74 per cent in the past 50 years			0

@entity28 and @entity44 say the @entity30 *'s* wildlife population fell by 30 per cent between 1970 and 2008
birds , animals and fish living in freshwater have fared even worse , tumbling by 70 per cent in the same time frame
