it ’s the bane of any avid music listeners ; headphones seemingly always become tangled when they ’re stored in a pocket , bag or elsewhere			0
but the mystery of headphones tangling might finally be solved thanks to a study that suggests a workable solution			1
physicist @entity10 from @entity11 in @entity12 says that clipping the two earbuds together , then attaching them to the end near the audio jack , will solve the problem - and he ’s got the research to prove it			1
the mystery of how to stop headphones tangling has finally been solved ( shown ) physicist @entity10 from @entity11 in @entity12 says that clipping the two earbuds together , then attaching them to the end near the audio jack , will solve the problem - and he 's got the research to prove it in a separate study in mid-june experts from the @entity25 , investigated the probability of knotting , the type of knots formed and the dependence on string length in their study			1
@entity33 and @entity34 confirmed that ‘ complex knots often form within seconds ’ and that stiffer wires are slightly less likely to form such mind - boggling tangles			0
when shaken up , the wires form coils and the loose end weaves though the other strands , creating the annoying knots			0
@entity10 set out to investigate this so - called ‘ @entity44 ’			1
@entity10 of @entity11 says that if string can get into knots , it will do			1
building on earlier mathematical research , he concluded that string really does have a perverse tendency to knot spontaneously			0
he also found the longer the string is , the more likely it is to spontaneously knot			1
joining the ends together dramatically reduces the probability of the string performing the manoeuvres needed to form knots , making tangling less likely , something he calls the @entity57			2
@entity58 is an adage that basically means anything that can go wrong , will go wrong			0
similarly , @entity10 says that any string that can get into knots , will do			1
to test his theory that string will always form loops he asked schools to conduct experiments , jumbling up regular parcel string to varying lengths and then repeating this process with each string having its ends joined , forming a loop			1
children at @entity73 near @entity74 performed 12,000 individual knotting tests with string ranging in size from 55 to 183 centimetres ( 21.6 to 72 inches )			0
they found that the results of the experiments confirmed the ‘ @entity85 ’ , proving that simply joining the ends of your headphone cable together can dramatically cut the chance of it knotting			2
in his study @entity10 tasked children at @entity73 near @entity74 to perform 12,000 individual knotting tests with string ranging in size from 55 to 183 centimetres ( 21.6 to 72 inches )			1
they found that the results of the experiments confirmed the @entity85 and proved his solution ‘ the study explains why your headphone cable mysteriously turns into one big jumbled mess while it ’s in your bag or pocket , ’ said @entity10			1
‘ we ’ve also struck upon an easy solution - simply clipping together the two ends of the cords makes the cable less likely to form a knot - saving the frustration of having to untangle it before plugging in			2
‘ this was all about using hard science to tackle an everyday issue			0
‘ it was great to see how enthusiastic school students were to get to grips with the surprisingly complex science behind the phenomenon , and carry out experiments to study the effect and identify the solution			0
’ the phenomenon of spontaneous knotting also has other real - world implications			0
it has attracted interest from biochemists working on dna , as this thread - like molecule also gets itself tangled , with potentially serious consequences			0
the new findings in @entity10 ’ paper suggest that nature may sometimes form loops in @entity119 to reduce this risk			2
‘ this was a fun piece of research that has an immediate application that everyone can benefit from , but any implication our findings have on the fight to solve major health challenges will be even more important , ’ @entity10 added .			2

physicist at @entity11 in @entity12 found solution to tangling
@entity10 asked schools *nationwide* to test his ' string theory '
to stop headphones tangling he says the earbuds must be connected
they should then be clipped to the cable near to the audio jack
this solves ' @entity44 ' : anything that can tangle , will tangle
