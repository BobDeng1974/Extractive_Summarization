middle - aged drinkers are lowering their alcohol consumption as a result of health fears , according to a new survey			2
researchers found a ‘ marked decline ’ in drinking with age , suggesting health warnings might finally be getting through			0
they found that twice as many people had given up alcohol as a decade ago			2
older people with poor or deteriorating health had the steepest decline in the quantity and frequency of alcohol consumed			0
there has been a ‘ marked decline ’ in drinking with age , suggesting health warnings are finally working it is thought opportunities for social drinking may be limited by poor health , while some people heeded medical advice about alcohol consumption and interactions with medication			2
the decade - long research project into the drinking habits of 4,500 people over the age of 45 also found older women reduced their drinking after the loss of a partner , contrary to previous findings			1
widows reduced their drinking levels by more than 16 per cent , while those in a partnership cut back around 11 per cent over the 10 - year study period			1
poor health and lower levels of education resulted in lower levels of alcohol consumption – well below the threshold set for ‘ safe ’ drinking ’			0
academics at @entity50 and @entity51 , who studied 4,500 men and women in @entity55 , say life events tend to lead to a drop in alcohol consumption in older adults			1
the exception was among wealthy , educated , single men who were most likely to drink more in later life and fail to cut down			1
this is likely due to multiple opportunities to socialise , as part of a single life , and having more disposable income			1
the study found most over- 45s cut their alcohol consumption after a ‘ life event ’ such as bereavement			1
but rich , single men were the only exception , possibly because they have the most disposable income and opportunities to socialise			1
the average man aged over 45 drank 14 glasses , while retired men with poor health and no qualifications consumed five			0
the study , funded by the @entity83 , found older women drank seven glasses on average			1
contrary to previous findings , they tended to reduce their drinking after a divorce or the death of their partner			0
lead researcher @entity92 said : ‘ our findings suggest that the group most at risk of heavy drinking in later life are older single men with high levels of education and above average wealth			1
' these men might not identify their drinking as problem behaviour			0
’ those that used to or still smoke are most likely to drink more in later life			1
such men drank on average an equivalent of 24 small glasses of wine a week at the start of the study in 1998 and 2000			1
this was in sharp contrast to single , retired men with poor health and no qualifications who drank on average an equivalent of five small glasses of wine a week at the start of the study			1
@entity126 , older men carried on drinking at these levels , while on average men over 45 drank around 14 small glasses of wine a week			0
older women drank seven small glasses of red wine on average , says the study funded by the @entity83			2
the lower limits for safe drinking are set at 21 units for men and 14 for women			2
just three per cent of older men and women were heavy drinkers – consuming more than 50 units a week for men and 35 units a week for women			2
for women , the end of a partnership was linked with less drinking			0
from the people studied , women who lost a partner reduced their drinking levels by more than 16 per cent at the end of the ten year study			1
this was a bigger reduction than those in a partnership whose drinking fell by 11 per cent during the same period			0
middle aged people who had stopped drinking completely at the start of the study were more likely to experience an improvement in health compared to drinkers			0
professor @entity92 , professor of @entity161 at @entity50 and lead researcher on the project , said ‘ over the @entity165 period many people consume more alcohol			0
a study found most over- 45s cut back on alcohol after a ‘ life event ’ such as bereavement ( file picture ) ‘ our findings suggest that the group most at risk of heavy drinking in later life are older single men with high levels of education and above average wealth			1
‘ suggesting that health organisations target this group is not necessarily straightforward as these men might not identify their drinking as problem behaviour			0
‘ also this group are less likely to have poor health in the short term , hence the need for intervention might not be apparent			0
’ she said the research challenged conclusions from smaller studies that a partnership ending led to alcohol misuse in later life			0
‘ in particular , our analysis of drinking behaviours demonstrates that change in partnership status for women is associated with a reduction in alcohol consumption			2
‘ as a result it is not necessarily appropriate to target alcohol services at this group of older people ’ she added .			0

most over- 45s cut consumption after ' life event ' such as bereavement
@entity218 studied 4,500 men and women in @entity55 for a decade
study finds wealthy , educated single men drink the most in later life
