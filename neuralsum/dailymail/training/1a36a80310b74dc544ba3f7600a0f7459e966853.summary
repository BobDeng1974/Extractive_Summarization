@entity1 , from @entity9 , @entity10 , has been on benefits since 2000 when he suffered a shattered pelvis , damage to his spinal cord , and reduced use of his right arm			1
then in 2008 he was involved in a biking accident in which he broke his tibia and fibula then two years later had to have his right leg amputated			1
in february , the @entity21 told him he could keep his benefits			1
but this week he has been told he has to complete ' work - related activities ' or face having his benefits suspended			1
' that letter from the @entity21 dated february 8 says i 'm fully disabled and unfit for work , ' he said , ' so why are they now saying just six weeks later that i have to be looking for work when clearly i ca n't ? ' the father - of - four said his disabilities - combined with dyslexia that renders him unable to read or write - made him unemployable			1
he said he never knew from one day to the next whether he was able to fit his prosthetic leg , be reliant on crutches or even his wheelchair for mobility			0
' if i could work i would , but i ca n't do anything , ' he said			1
' it 's not just me , i know of other people that have been struck off			0
' there 's a man down the road who 's being struck off now and he 's got cerebral palsy and can hardly walk , has a crook hand and he 's being forced to work			2
' @entity45 : he had to have his right leg amputated in 2010 following a motorcycle accident			2
he was confirmed as ' fully disabled ' and ' unfit to work ' just six weeks ago the charity scope has described the government 's @entity52 reforms as ' fundamentally flawed ' and will adversely impact on an estimated 600,000 people nationally			1
' in 2013 , disabled people are struggling to make ends meet , ' scope chief executive @entity58 said			2
' life costs more if you 're disabled			0
but this year living costs are spiralling and income is flat - lining			2
@entity63 needs reforming and could be better targeted to meet the extra costs people face , ' he added , ' but disabled people are frightened by the government 's plans			0
' they believe it 's just an excuse to cut their support			0
' tough : secretary of state for work and pensions @entity75 has made it tougher to claim disability benefits a spokesman for the @entity21 said it does not comment on individual cases			1
the latest in a series of radical changes to the welfare system come into effect on april 8 – with most benefits being uprated by just one per cent , below inflation , and disability living allowance ( @entity63 ) being replaced with a new personal independence payment ( @entity52 )			0
official figures suggest that 71 per cent of those being paid @entity63 get the benefit ' without systematic checks ' and that there has been a sharp increase in parts of @entity97 , notably the @entity98 and the @entity99 , in the run - up to reform			0
claims for disability benefit had more than doubled in some parts of the country as people scramble to ' get ahead ' of the tough new regime			0
work and pensions secretary @entity75 said the surge was an illustration of the need to reform a ' ridiculous ' system which has seen the numbers claiming spiral to 3.2 million , at a cost to taxpayers of £ 13.2 billion			0
this is about the same as the entire budget of the @entity118 .			0
