by @entity1 reporter published : 20:13 est , 23 may 2013 updated : 20:13 est , 23 may 2013 a new @entity3 ad has taken a direct jab at @entity5 , the latest salvo in the tense tablet war between the two tech giants			2
turning up the snark , the 30 - second ad features a side - by - side comparison of the two computers , an @entity13 on the left and the @entity16 tablet on the right			1
the commercial features @entity5 â€™s @entity19 , the voice recognition software that @entity5 first unveiled in the @entity21 in 2011			1
two for one : @entity3 tries in the ad to hammer home the point that @entity13 's can not display to apps on the screen at once ' sorry , i do n't update like that , ' the voice says in @entity19 's signature tone as the @entity16 tablet displays a video and email at the same time			1
the voice continues : ' i 'm sorry , i can only do one thing at a time			0
' ' i guess @entity36 is n't one of those things , ' the mock @entity19 adds , hammering home the fact that @entity5 devices do n't feature @entity3 apps			2
apparently giving up , ' @entity19 ' asks : ' should we just play chopsticks ? ' - an apparent dig at the @entity13 commercial where a user plays the song on the @entity13 's @entity50 app in a past @entity13 ad			0
competition : the @entity3 ad also makes the point that the @entity13 does not feature the tech giants signature apps like @entity36 getting personal : apparently giving up , the mock @entity19 asks : ' should we just play chopsticks ? ' - an apparent dig at the @entity13 commercial where a user plays the song on the @entity13 's @entity50 app in a past @entity13 ad the ad then makes its final argument with a price comparison - $ 699 for the 64 gb @entity13 and $ 449 for the @entity16 tablet			1
despite @entity3 's argument , @entity5 does not appear to be losing ground in the tablet wars , as the @entity16 tablet received less - than - stellar reviews and has so far failed to measure up to the hype and sales of the similar @entity5 and @entity73 devices			1
critics , as well as some consumers , lambasted the technology giant over @entity16 , mentioning the confusing array of touchscreen tiles and lack of @entity3 's trademark ' @entity82 ' button			0
while @entity3 has experienced growth in recent years , any success is eclipsed by @entity5 , which unveiled the @entity85 at about the same time as @entity16			0
let 's talk price : at the conclusion of the ad , @entity3 delivers a price comparison - $ 250 less than the @entity13 some reviewers liked the way @entity16 greets users with a mosaic of tiles displaying applications instead of relying on the desktop icons that served as the welcome mat for years			2
but others say it 's a confusing jumble that will frustrate users accustomed to the older versions , particularly when they switch to desktop mode and do n't see the familiar ' start ' button and menu			0
struck by the flurry of complaints , @entity3 announced earlier this month that it was giving @entity108 8 a makeover , known as @entity110 .			0
