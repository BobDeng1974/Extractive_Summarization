@entity0 said the use of chemical weapons in @entity3 crossed a ' red line ' for @entity5 and its allies there is ' growing evidence ' that the @entity3 government has committed war crimes against its own people by using chemical weapons in the country ’s brutal civil war , @entity0 warned today			1
if it is confirmed @entity3 forces had used the weapons , the regime of beleaguered president @entity16 would have crossed what the prime minister called the ‘ red line ’ opening the way for @entity5 and its allies to intervene in the two - year conflict			1
mr @entity0 said he did not think it was ' likely ' that @entity5 troops would be sent in to @entity3 , but vowed to send a ' very clear warning ' to the government that the ' appalling actions ' would not be tolerated '			2
it is understood that @entity5 has obtained samples from inside @entity3 that have been tested by the @entity30 at @entity31 , @entity32			1
further samples of hair and soil suspected of containing the nerve agent sarin and to have been used in an attack near the city of @entity39 13 days ago are said to have been also passed to scientists			0
intelligence gleaned by both the @entity5 and @entity43 indicated there is evidence that @entity16 ’s forces had used the weapons and in particular sarin , officials said			1
@entity49 has previously said the use of chemical weapons would be a ' red line ' for the @entity43 to intervene			1
mr @entity0 said : ' there is growing evidence that we 've seen of the use of chemical weapons , probably by the regime , it 's extremely serious			1
' this is a war crime and we should take it very seriously			0
' he said the government was being ' careful not to make the mistake sometimes made in the past ' by rushing claims into the domain domain , seen as a reference to @entity65 's claims that @entity66 had weapons of mass destruction			0
mr @entity0 told @entity69 : ' we 're trying to consider the evidence with our allies , make sure that we can verify it , but this is extremely serious and i think what president @entity49 said was absolutely right , t that this should form for the international community a red line for us to do more			1
' today two @entity3 officials denied the government has used chemical weapons against rebel forces , saying the regime had no need for them			1
@entity3 official @entity84 called the @entity43 claims ' lies ' and likened them to false accusations that @entity66 possessed weapons of mass destruction ahead of the @entity43 invasion of that country			2
the strategically placed town near @entity97 has reportedly been captured by government forces after five weeks of fighting injured : a video posted on @entity101 and @entity102 appears to show victims of a @entity3 regime assault on @entity39 foaming at the mouth suggesting the use of sarin gas graphic : the video was posted on the @entity101 page of @entity5 - trained doctor @entity110 , who treated some of the @entity39 victims @entity5 has led calls for the international community to step up its support for rebel forces battling to overthrow @entity16			1
but this week there were warnings that @entity5 nationals joining the fighting in @entity3 were being radicalised by violent @entity122 groups and could launch terror attacks when they return home			2
mr @entity0 added : ' i ’ve always been keen for us to do more , we ’re working with the opposition , we want our allies and partners to do more with us to shape that opposition , to make sure we ’re supporting people with good motives , who want a good outcome to put pressure on that regime so that we can bring it to an end			0
' he insisted he did not ' want to see ' @entity5 troops sent in to @entity3 , but said a clear message had to be sent to the @entity3 government			2
' i do n’t want to see that and i do n’t think that is likely to happen but i think we can step up the pressure on the regime , work with our partners , work with the opposition in order to bring about the right outcome			0
' but we need to go on gathering this evidence and also to send a very clear warning ot the @entity3 regime about these appalling actions			0
' claims : @entity43 secretary of defense @entity155 said intelligence sources had confirmed the use of @entity160 gas by the @entity3 government during a press conference in @entity162 today it comes after both the @entity43 and @entity5 went public last night with claims that chemical weapons had been used			1
a @entity167 spokesman said : ‘ we have limited but persuasive information from various sources showing chemical weapon use in @entity3 , including sarin			1
' use of chemical weapons is a war crime			2
we have briefed our allies , partners and the @entity178 on this information and we are working actively to get more and better information			0
' ( @entity16 ) @entity16 must cooperate with the international community and prove that his regime has not committed this horrific crime , allowing unrestricted access for the @entity178 and @entity185 ( @entity185 ) to investigate on the ground in @entity3			1
' the @entity5 claims came minutes after @entity43 defence secretary @entity155 said @entity43 intelligence had concluded with ‘ some degree of varying confidence ’ that @entity16 ’s forces have used chemical weapons on a ‘ small scale ’			1
he added : ' the intelligence community has been assessing information for some time on this issue and the decision to reach this conclusion was made within the past 24 hours			0
' @entity43 secretary of state @entity199 suggested @entity16 ’s forces had ‘ launched ’ two chemical attacks			0

warning : @entity43 president @entity49 has said that the use of chemical weapons in @entity3 would be a ' game changer ' while @entity3 president @entity16 said the @entity213 will pay a price ' in the heart ' of @entity216 and the @entity43 for their alleged backing @entity218 fundamentalists @entity219 called for a @entity178 investigation but former presidential candidate @entity221 said the @entity213 should intervene			1
‘ what i worry about is that now ... that @entity16 has crossed the red line that the president has established and we do n’t take action , ’ he said			0
‘ @entity231 , @entity230 , others in the region will be paying close attention			0
’ the @entity233 believes @entity3 has had a chemical weapons programme for years			1

' however , the letter also hints that a broad @entity43 response is not imminent			0
there have been four reports in recent months of chemical weapons being deployed by the @entity16 regime			1
@entity3 is thought by the @entity233 to have a large stockpile of chemical weapons thought to include sarin and mustard gas that can be deployed using aircraft , ballistic missiles and artillery rocket			1
destruction : parts of the northern @entity3 city of @entity39 have been destroyed during the bitter civil war			0
the aftermath of a separate assault by the @entity3 regime on the city is pictured 10 - year - old @entity3 refugee @entity307 waves the victory sign in front of a wall with the colors of the revolutionary flag , and @entity305 reading , ' @entity3 , do n't worry , we will return , ' in @entity309 , @entity310 both the rebel forces and @entity16 's regime have accused each other of using them and there have been reports from iside @entity3 of containers , possibly conatining @entity160 , being dropped from the air			1

the @entity5 will send 34 vehicles , including five armoured 4x4s and 20 sets of body armour to those seeking to overthrow dictator @entity16			2
the @entity49 administration opposes directly arming @entity3 opposition fighters , in part out of fear that the weapons could fall into the hands of @entity218 extremists			2
@entity160 is a more sophisticated successor to @entity354 which was used by the @entity355 in the extermination of millions of @entity357 in @entity359 's death camps			0
it is like some farm pesticides but does not occur naturally and can not occur naturally			0
@entity362 used it in the late 80s against @entity365 rebels and it was behind the death of the entire population of @entity369			0
@entity178 agents destroy chemical weapons stockpiled by @entity362 in 1998 it is so toxic that a drop the size of a pin prick is enough to kill and it is heavier than air so it hovers close to the ground maximising casualties			2
fumes from the colourless , odourless liquid last longer the warmer the environment so the constant 25 ° c on @entity382 's subway provided the perfect condition			0
