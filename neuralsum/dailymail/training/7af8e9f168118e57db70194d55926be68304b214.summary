the date is august 2 , 1914 , and in a @entity1 square a crowd reacts enthusiastically as a soldier reads out a proclamation that @entity5 has declared war			1
among them , cheering wildly and waving his hat , is the unmistakable figure of a 25 - year - old @entity11			2
this was the moment , the day that imperial @entity5 plunged into the @entity13 , at which he finally he found his purpose in life , he was to claim later			1
it was later used for his election campaign the photo first appeared in the pages of the @entity32 propaganda publication @entity33 on march 12 , 1932 , the year @entity11 ran for president , with the breathless caption : ‘ @entity11 , the @entity5 patriot , is seen in the middle of the crowd			1
he stands with blazing eyes – @entity11			2
’ but now , 100 years after it was taken , there are claims the photo was faked and @entity11 was never among the crowd in the @entity41 square			0
research has failed to turn up the original negative of the picture			1
and intense scrutiny of newsreel footage has failed to spot @entity11 among the throng			0
trimmed : @entity11 preferred a longer moustache in his younger years , only trimming it to fit under a gas mask when he became a soldier , historians claim even the length of his moustache would also seem to indicate that the image of @entity11 was inserted into the picture			1
in 1914 he preferred a longer moustache , only trimming it when he was a soldier so it would fit under a gas mask			0
further evidence that perhaps the whole thing was faked by him and @entity20 – later his personal photographer whose assistant @entity63 would go on to become @entity11 ’s mistress – can be found in the pages of @entity11 ’s autobiography @entity66 , published in 1925			1
he makes no mention of being in the @entity41 on august 2 but does make reference to the following day , when he petitions the @entity69 to allow him , an @entity70 , to fight for @entity5			0
@entity20 was a master manipulator of photographs who did his patron ’s bidding			0
experts say it would have been easy for him to insert the photo of @entity11 into the crowd scene			0
in a report about the research , @entity5 newspaper @entity80 said : ‘ some historians are expressing suspicions that the photo was manipulated , although it is virtually impossible to prove also that it is a forgery			2
‘ @entity11 said his desire to be a politician stemmed from that day in @entity1			1
but the story is perhaps just a little bit too perfect			0
’ researcher @entity91 , who was asked to prove the provenance of the photo , said : ‘ its authenticity is based solely on the testimony of @entity11			0
‘ in the city archive of @entity1 there are several shots of the crowd in the @entity41 , but the man with the famous moustache is not in any of them			2

image of @entity11 in @entity105 , @entity1 , shows ' dictator *celebrating* @entity13 '
was printed in @entity32 publications , *crucial* part of 1932 election campaign
historians claim his moustache is too short , ' trimmed it later as a soldier '
research team also claim they can not find trace of the original negative
*suggestions* personal photographer @entity20 manipulated it
