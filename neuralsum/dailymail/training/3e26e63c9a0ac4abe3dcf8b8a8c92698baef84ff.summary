by @entity1 reporter published : 03:59 est , 21 april 2013 updated : 18:11 est , 21 april 2013 criminal activity could be all in the brain , meaning offenders can not control their behaviour and need treatment to help them stay on the straight and narrow , according to a @entity9 academic			2
many repeat offenders , killers and psychopaths share abnormal patterns of activity that could help to explain why they turn to crime , neuroimaging of their brains by @entity19 has previously found			2
psychopaths and murderers also have low activity in the front parts of the brain related to processing emotions , self - awareness and being sensitive to violence			1
abnormal brain activity could be the cause of criminal behaviour for some now , in his new book @entity31 , @entity19 , a criminology professor at the @entity33 , says that those who commit domestic violence , aggressive teens or lesser offenders also share those abnormalities and keep doing ' the same wrong things '			1
he says : ' the seeds of sin are brain - based ' but could be tackled with the right treatment			0
' the finding suggests that many people currently being punished for their crimes can not actually control their behaviour , and should be seen as suffering from a disorder that needs treatment , ' he told the @entity49			0
offenders studied by @entity19 had low activity in parts of the brain associated with emotions @entity19 and a team of neuroscientists found that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex - a part of the brain associated with decision - making - is found to be shrunken in habitual criminals with psychopathic tendencies			1
in repeat impulsive offenders , the part of the brain related to learning from your mistakes - the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex - has been found to be underdeveloped			0
previously , research has shown that low activity in the anterior cingulate is linked to a higher risk of reoffending while shrunken amygdalas , related to emotions and morality , have been found in teenagers with conduct disorders - described by doctors as aggressive and anti-social traits			1
these include burglary , violence and pathological lying			0
@entity84 , a clinical psychology lecturer at @entity85 , told the @entity49 : ' if the parts of your brain involved in feeling guilt or empathy are damaged , then there is an issue of diminished responsibility			2
it is too early to use this research in courts , but we have to ask if they are truly to blame for their behaviour			0
