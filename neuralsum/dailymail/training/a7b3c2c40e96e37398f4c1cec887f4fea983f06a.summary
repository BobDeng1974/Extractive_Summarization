at @entity1 on sunday , @entity0 has to make the biggest decision of his short career as head coach of @entity5 : @entity6 can not play			1
the striker 's lack of commitment at @entity11 last sunday , when he was dragged off after 58 minutes , was not just an affront to his team - mates , it was an insult to the sport itself			1
for @entity0 to make his mark at @entity5 , to show the players that he really is the boss , @entity6 can not be in that team to face @entity18			1
@entity6 sits on the ground after failing to score against @entity20 on sunday @entity6 was awful at @entity11 on sunday and his place in the @entity5 team must now be in doubt the @entity5 striker ( centre ) sees a chance saved by @entity20 keeper @entity27 when clean through time on pitch : 58 minutes goals : 0 shots : 2 on target : 2 touches : 32 ( see touch map below ) passes : 25 completed : 20 ( 80 per cent ) challenges : 5 challenges won : 1 @entity36 : 0 fouls : 1 @entity38 : 1 to make a decision as big as this , to tell a 30 - year - old forward who has played for @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 , that he no longer justifies his selection will not be easy			1
sure , he could play against @entity18 at the weekend , he could add to his tally of two goals for @entity5 this season and everyone can pretend all is well with the world again			1
@entity6 ’s dwindling number of supporters will often stand up for him and tell you ‘ he is unplayable on his day ’			2
it has been an awful long time since anyone has been able to say that about the @entity61 striker			0
a couple of years , or more , perhaps			0
@entity6 's heat map against @entity20 - he was a peripheral figure in that match @entity6 was replaced by @entity67 after 58 minutes at @entity11 and the change galvanised @entity5 @entity5 fans ' favourite @entity67 ( right ) hares off after scoring the winner against @entity20 in added time in 2009 , when he was still at @entity43 , he scored the best goal of his career inside @entity75 during a @entity77 clash with @entity78			1
@entity6 's touch map against @entity20 - he touched the ball just 32 times @entity6 , then one of the most feared and accomplished strikers in @entity84 , still regards that overhead kick as one of his personal favourites			1
it has not always gone so well			0
in the past three seasons , since his permanent move to @entity90 from @entity44 after a spell on loan at @entity1 and time at @entity45 , he has scored 24 goals			0
his two this season were one in the 4 - 0 rout of @entity98 at @entity1 and a header in the 2 - 1 home defeat against @entity101			0
for the long - term health and benefit of this @entity5 team , @entity0 has to stand up to a senior player and show that he is prepared to take the big decisions			1
@entity6 went through the motions last sunday , plodding around the pitch until the @entity5 fans singing ‘ @entity67 , he is one of us ’ finally got their way			1
by that stage @entity6 had touched the ball just 32 times and failed to round @entity27 when he was put through one - on - one with the @entity20 keeper			1
@entity6 ’s heart just does n't seem to be in it anymore and that attitude is transmitting itself to the rest of the team			2
@entity122 , who scored a beauty at @entity11 in their win there the previous season under @entity127 , looks shot to bits alongside him			0
@entity129 , shunted out to the right at @entity20 when he should be playing in a central role , is a far better player than his form suggests			2
@entity5 manager @entity0 ( right ) must now drop @entity6 for the weekend 's clash with @entity18 since he moved permanently to @entity5 , @entity6 has not impressed ... @entity6 on loan ( 2011 - 12 ) matches 37 goals 18 @entity6 permanently ( august 2012 - present ) matches 70 goals 24 @entity138 , the captain , @entity140 , @entity141 and @entity142 are among those suffering in this @entity5 team when they play in the @entity145			1
the momentum is with the youngster @entity67 , a striker with the fraction of @entity6 ’s ability			1
he has the heart of a lion , though			0
when he replaced @entity6 , his striking work - rate galvanised this @entity5 team			2
it would be a brave man to argue that it was anything other than the presence of @entity67 , sprinting everywhere and hustling @entity20 defenders , that brought @entity5 back into this game			1
in the final minute he showed some admirable qualities when he told @entity160 , another substitute , that he would be taking the free - kick that led to @entity5 ’s winner			2
@entity6 ( second left ) heads in one of his two goals this season , in the 2 - 1 defeat by @entity101 @entity6 scoring one of the finest goals of his career , for @entity43 against @entity78 in 2009 @entity67 knows he is on to a good thing and his endearing celebration in front of the @entity5 fans in the @entity11 only adds to his allure			1
he is a talismanic figure			0
there is an enthusiasm about his game , a first class attitude and a desire to play , whatever the circumstances or the adversity			0
sadly those days are over for @entity6			2
last season , after being isolated by @entity127 , the re-integration process began under @entity186			0
he responded with a few goals , scoring 14 by the time @entity186 was sacked by @entity5 chairman @entity188 at the end of the season			0
getting a full 90 minutes out of him these days is not easy and @entity0 has to address this growing problem			2
the fall - out , of course , could run into days , if not weeks , if @entity6 reacts badly			0
we have been here before with him			0
@entity186 spoke of ‘ managing men ’ when he replaced @entity127 , but the @entity5 forward should be able to manage himself after the clubs he has played for			0
in january , it is time for @entity0 to tell him to find another .			0

@entity0 must *jettison* @entity6 against @entity18
@entity5 striker @entity6 touched the ball just 32 times before being substituted after 58 minutes against @entity20
his replacement @entity67 changed the game and scored the winner
@entity0 has to stand up to a senior player and show he is the boss
