three weeks ago , @entity0 discussed @entity2 ’s fixture against @entity3 and happened to mention , rather provocatively , that the midfielder the two sides had in common was now in love with the @entity7			1
on saturday , it became increasingly evident that @entity2 ’s fans are returning the affection			1
barely four months have passed since it was confirmed @entity12 would leave @entity13 for @entity14			1
in that short time the midfielder , almost as much as @entity16 , has lifted this side from contenders to significant title favourites			0
@entity16 draws the bulk of the credit			0
goals are the most valued commodity and nine in seven games mean he is , rightly , seen as the key cog in @entity0 ’s machine			0
the absence of such an effective frontman last season makes his impact all the more obvious and profound			0
his absence in the coming fixtures with a hamstring complaint might highlight his importance further still			0
but what of @entity12 ? @entity2 ’s squad was not crying out so loudly for a player in his mould during the summer			1
yet if they win the title – granted , a strange suggestion considering it is october – it would be impossible , at this stage , to imagine the 27 - year - old and his unique qualities not being at the heart of the success			1
against @entity65 on saturday , he scored his first @entity33 goal of the season			1
the magnificence of the goal came from its speed and the speed came from @entity12 ’ vision			1
he takes possession 35 yards from goal and rolls the ball into the feet of @entity77			0
from there it ’s a one - touch blitz as @entity77 returns the pass and @entity12 feeds @entity81 , who puts the midfielder through on goal			1
the finish is delightful and the goal rivals @entity87 ’s for @entity3 against @entity88 last season			0
the @entity90 international ( right ) was mesmeric in @entity2 's 2 - 1 win at @entity65 on saturday @entity92 ( centre ) scored the decisive goal of the game following a beautiful move in the second half @entity12 ( left ) celebrates his strike with @entity81 - after being assisted by the @entity99 international significantly , @entity12 never once looks down and was part of the move ’s origin , back in his own half			1
surges from deep are what he does			0
it was telling that in the match , he ran 7.4 miles – 0.4miles further than the next most energetic player			0
@entity113 , on the same day that @entity0 spoke of @entity12 ’s love for all things blue , told journalists his former charge was not a defensive player			2
that he was still , at heart , an offensive creator whose home these days was foraging runs from deep , like @entity120 does at @entity3			0
it is in that position , in front of the back four but not defending , where @entity2 needed improving , albeit not as much as up front			2
last season , it was largely down to @entity129 to be the deep - lying presence			2
in big games , the excellent @entity131 had @entity133 next to him			0
it is easy to see , therefore , why a tactical layer of @entity129 and @entity12 is so much better			2
@entity12 ' midfield partnership with @entity129 ( left ) has provided a better balance to the @entity2 side it is the platform from which @entity12 can have the most impact			1
on saturday , he played 123 passes – more than anyone else			0
in context , @entity143 hit the most for @entity65 with 50			2
all @entity2 moves seem to move through @entity12 , who in turn has become the side ’s pacemaker of sorts , deciding when is the right time for urgency and when is the right time to wait			1
at @entity13 - a spell that @entity113 feels did not go as well as @entity12 would have hoped - he played in the middle of a midfield three and as a forward and sometimes on the side			1
when he arrived at @entity2 , it was n’t obvious where he would play			2
but by fielding him next to @entity129 , @entity0 has made the most of his energy , intelligence and ability to match clever runs with clever passes			0
he has seven assists for the season and @entity16 has often been handed the acclaim for finishing the moves			0
@entity168 indicated after the @entity65 win that surviving a @entity16 injury was the big question hanging over @entity2 ’s credentials			1
but one imagines @entity0 , and the club ’s fans , are equally keen to keep @entity12 healthy			2
@entity12 ( left ) made more passes than anyone else at @entity177 on saturday with 123 the midfielder ( left ) also ran more than other player - covering a total of 7.4 miles during the match @entity182 pleased with evolution of team			1

@entity12 has been a *revelation* in midfield since joining @entity2
the @entity90 star scored in the 2 - 1 @entity33 win at @entity65
@entity12 joined @entity2 for *£* *30million* move from @entity13 this summer
