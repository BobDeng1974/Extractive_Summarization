by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter refugees fleeing persecution in their home country because they are gay should be granted asylum in the @entity10 , the bloc 's top court ruled today			2
judges at the @entity12 said homosexuals facing imprisonment may have sufficient grounds to be allowed to stay in the @entity10			0
the existence of laws imprisoning homosexuals ' may constitute an act of persecution per se ' if they are routinely enforced , the court said			1
the @entity12 said existence of laws prohibiting homosexuality could be an act of persecution ' per se ' a homosexual can not be expected to conceal his sexual orientation in his home country to avoid persecution , since it would amount to renouncing a ' characteristic fundamental to a person 's identity , ' the court added			1
international treaties say people must prove they have a ' well - founded fear ' of persecution for reasons of race , religion , ethnicity or political opinion if they are to obtain asylum			0
it is not yet clear how asylum authorities are supposed to check a seeker 's claim they are gay the court said it will be up to @entity47 's national authorities to determine whether the situation in an applicant 's home country amounts to persecution , especially whether homosexuals are indeed sentenced to prison terms there			1
some nations have laws against homosexuality but rarely enforce them			0
the @entity47 court ruled on three cases of nationals from @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 seeking asylum in the @entity64			0
the case was brought by the @entity64 @entity66 seeking clarification on the application of relevant @entity10 laws			1
the @entity66 said it will now proceed with the asylum cases and others brought on the same grounds since the cases were sent to @entity74 in april 2012			0
however , it still remains unclear how national asylum authorities should check a person 's claim of being homosexual			1
the @entity64 @entity66 in march also referred that problem to the judges , asking what the limits are for the ' method of assessing the credibility of a declared sexual orientation ' under @entity10 laws			2
but the @entity12 is n't expected to rule on that issue before next year .			0
