the remains of a woolly mammoth that died 10,000 years ago have been unearthed in @entity2 by oil workers			1
two tusks , teeth and rib bones of the extinct giant mammal were discovered buried three metres down in the frozen soil around 31 miles ( 50km ) from @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11			1
oil workers had been digging at a site owned by @entity15 close to the town when they noticed a tusk sticking out of the excavator bucket			1
ancient : two mammoth tusks ( shown above ) together with fragments of jaw , teeth , tibia and ribs were dug from the frozen soil of @entity2			2
oil workers noticed a tusk sticking out of the excavator bucket using shovels they then unearthed a second tust , a tibia , ribs , teeth and fragments of the animal 's jaw			1
@entity37 , head of palaeontology at the @entity39 , said he believes the mammoth is at least 10,000 years old			0
since the 1700s scientists have debated what caused the demise of mammoths			0
all but a few isolated island populations disappeared between 20,000 and 10,000 years ago			0
one popular theory , bolstered by this study , is that @entity49 people hunted most of the mammoths out of existence			0
however , some experts argue that global warming helped make the giant creatures extinct between 20,000 and 25,000 years ago			0
other researchers argue that an impact of extraterritorial objects in @entity57 13,000 years ago , led to rapid climate change , eventually wiping out the mammoths			2
today , it 's thought that a combination of factors led to extinction			0
he estimated that the giant animal had been a fully grown adult female , around 30 to 40 years old when she died			2
he said they hoped to conduct further analysis of the bones to learn more about the mammoth			0
he told the @entity70 : ' we can send the find to determine the radiocarbon date			0
' genetic analysis will help to determine which population this mammoth was from - @entity76 or @entity57			1
' recent research has shown that many woolly mammoths discovered in @entity2 may have originated in @entity79 and migrated across the @entity80 when sea levels were lower			1
many believe the original @entity2 population of mammoths disappeared around 40,000 years ago , with @entity57 mammoths dominating until around 4,500 years ago			1
the exact reason for their extinction is still debated with many blaming changes to the climate as causing their demise			0
others have pointed to evidence that humans and neanderthals hunted the giant creatures along with other ice age megafauna and may have pushed them to the brink of extinction			0
palaeontologists who examined the mammoth 's remains ( shown above ) estimate it died 10,000 years ago oil workers had been excavating a site 31 miles from @entity9 in @entity11 ( above ) when they found the mammoth			1
they estimate that the giant had been a fully grown female , around 30 to 40 years old a recent study has suggested that human hunting caused a massive drop in mammoth populations in western @entity76 around 30,000 years ago			1
just a few isolated populations of mammoth are though to have clung on			0
dozens of mammoth remains have been unearthed in @entity2 , including entire skeletons and even mummified bodies still preserved in the ice			1
the mammoth 's remains were unearthed about 30 miles from the town of @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11 @entity123 ( pictured above ) had been operating the digger when he unearthed the mammoth tusks @entity123 was operating the excavator when he discovered the latest mammoth			1
he said : ' i noticed something in the excavator bucket			1
it turned to be a mammoth tusk			2
' we have the rule - if we find something , we stop the work and call the bosses			0
' but i was also interested myself , in what this was			0
' i took the shovel and began to dig. ... found more remains , the second tusk , teeth and other bones			2
' woolly mammoths , like the one shown in the artists impression above , lived from about 200,000 years ago until around 4,500 years ago when the last isolated populations are thought to have died out completely			2

the remains of the woolly mammoth were found close to @entity9 in @entity11
oil workers for @entity15 noticed a tusk sticking out of the excavator bucket
palaeontologists estimate the mammoth had been a 30 - 40 year old female
they hope to carry out tests to find out whether it had migrated from @entity57 or was part of the native @entity2 population of woolly mammoths
