as she approached her 60th birthday , there was only one present @entity4 wanted - new breasts			1
the 59 - year - old from @entity7 was determined to wear a backless , silk dress as she celebrated her milestone birthday , and all that stood in her way was her ' saggy ' cleavage			0
so rather than consign the dress to her wardrobe , @entity4 instead booked to have a boob job in @entity19			1
forking out to look younger : @entity4 has spent more than £ 50,000 to roll back the years transformed : @entity4 , left , aged 44 when she was mistaken for her sister 's mother , and right , after more than 50 procedures including a boob job it 's not the first time she 's been under the knife			1

' @entity4 revealed that her obsession with surgery began aged 44 when she was mistaken for her younger sister 's mother at her wedding			1
@entity66 fix : @entity4 says she 's not addicted to surgery but is happy to go under the knife if necessary when she spots something she wants to change she explains : ' a friend of hers came up to me and asked if i was her mother			1
i did n't react at the time although i wanted to kill her ! it was like a stab in the back , i was shocked i never thought i looked that old			0
' i got back and looked in the mirror and thought " why would she think i 'm my sister 's mother ? " ' i studied my face and thought " you 've got a turkey neck and lines like the grand canyon "			1
i screamed and cried , then thought " now 's the time for a face lift "			1
' since then she has had dozens of procedures to help her look younger and slimmer			2
she said she is n't worried about an operation going disastrously wrong and does n't think she will even look unnatural as a result of playing with nature			0
