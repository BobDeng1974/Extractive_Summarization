@entity0 bucked the trend of @entity3 nations by increasing spending on foreign aid last year while others imposed savage cuts			1
more than half the members of a group of 28 industrialised nations reduced their aid budget between 2013 and 2014 , a report found			1
@entity0 's failure to follow suit – thanks to a target imposed by @entity16 – means that its overseas aid spending of 0.7 per cent of national income is double the average level of the other nations in the group known as the @entity22			1
a target set by @entity16 ( pictured at a rally this week ) has left @entity0 unable to follow other countries in reducing their aid budget between 2013 and 2014 out of every £ 100 spent by these @entity3 nations on overseas aid , no less than £ 14 now comes from the @entity0			1
overall across these 28 countries aid budgets fell by 0.5 per cent in real terms , according to the report by the @entity32			2
despite this , the @entity0 increased its spend by 1.2 per cent to £ 11.7billion in 2014			1
it comes on top of even larger increases in previous years			0
@entity38 slashed its aid budget by 9.2 per cent to £ 6.2billion , the fourth successive decrease			2
@entity41 's was cut by 15.3 per cent to £ 5.5billion			0
@entity42 cut its foreign aid by 7.2 per cent to £ 2.5billion , while cash - strapped @entity44 cut its funding by 20.3 per cent to £ 1.1billion			1
the @entity0 's aid budget is now nearly double @entity38 's and ten times the level in @entity44			1
in total , 15 members of the @entity22 cut foreign aid , including @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55			1
@entity0 was one of 13 countries which increased its budget despite the straitened times			2
these included @entity62 , the @entity63 and @entity64			0
@entity65 , not aid : conservative mp @entity66 surprisingly , @entity67 , which is dependent on bailouts from the @entity69 and the @entity70 , put up its aid budget by 6.8 per cent			0
last night @entity72 @entity66 , who is standing for re-election as mp for @entity75 , said : ' when we have seen cuts at home , people find it very strange that we can give away so many billions of pounds a year , half of which we do n't even control who it goes to			0
' people are telling me on the doorstep during this campaign that we should cut the amount we spend on overseas aid , and increase opportunities for poorer countries to trade with the @entity69 – trade , not aid , is what we need			2
what this report shows is that other governments recognise the fact that we have got to look after our own country first , and ensure aid is better targeted			0
' @entity0 's aid budget may need to rise by at least £ 500million in future years , because changes in @entity69 accounting rules make it harder to meet the 0.7 per cent target			1
the @entity22 was set up by the @entity32 which represents richer countries			0
the @entity32 report , 2014 @entity106 , shows that @entity0 is one of only five members of the @entity22 to meet the target of spending 0.7 per cent of national income on aid along with @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity53 and @entity114			1
the average @entity32 member spends just 0.39 per cent			0
in monetary terms , the @entity0 now has the second highest aid budget in the world behind the @entity63 which spends £ 19.6billion			1
but that is just 0.19 per cent of its national income			0
@entity38 spends 0.36 per cent , and @entity62 0.41 per cent			0
the 28 @entity22 members spent a total of £ 81billion on aid last year – a record figure , but down in real terms			2
it means the @entity0 's budget of £ 11.7billion is a seventh of the entire total for the western world			2
@entity132 , of @entity133 , praised @entity0 and criticised countries which have cut their aid budgets			1
' aid saves lives , ' he said			0
' what we 're seeing is shameful indifference on the part of many of the world 's richest nations			0
' their leaders are breaking with impunity the solemn promise they made to help @entity149			0

more than half of members of group of industrial nations reduced aid
but @entity0 failed to follow suit - thanks to target imposed by *mr* @entity16
its overseas spending is double the average level of other nations in group
