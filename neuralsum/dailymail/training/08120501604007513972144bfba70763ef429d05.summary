tougher restrictions on ammunition are needed to stop @entity4 - based jihadists carrying out @entity6 - style gun attacks , a former security minister has said			1
lord @entity7 said the @entity4 ’s tough anti-gun laws were a crucial tool in the fight against terror - but demanded further action to tighten restrictions on ammunition			1
the @entity16 peer also hit out at the deputy prime minister @entity17 for blocking new powers for the security services and urged ministers to increase anti-terror funding			1
appearing on the @entity34 's @entity33 show this morning lord @entity7 said the government ’s @entity35 , dubbed a ‘ snoopers ’ charter ’ by opponents , was needed to track terrorist suspects			1
the bill allows the security services to monitor who people are emailing and what they are looking at online			1
lord @entity7 said : ‘ i think that needs to go through , and i was very irked that it was removed , in fact it was removed by the deputy prime minister , when it had all been agreed across all parties			1
’ he added that the security services ‘ need more money ’ to monitor suspected terrorists amid claims that up to 150 fanatics have returned from the war in @entity60 intent on carrying out attacks at home			1
the @entity16 peer ’s warning comes after security chiefs warned last week that @entity4 was being targeted by @entity67 terrorists			1
@entity69 chief @entity68 said the terror group was plotting spectacular ' mass casualty ' attacks on the @entity4			1
@entity7 ( left ) was interviewed by the @entity34 presenter @entity33 ( centre ) alongside the @entity16 leader @entity75 ( right ) labour leader @entity75 said he was open minded about giving the security services more powers to monitor people 's emails fanatics wish to emulate ' crude ' attacks carried out overseas in recent months			1
chillingly , tactics could include a ' hit - and - run ' on a crowded public place using a lorry , van or car			0
unlike gun or bomb plots , which involves buying weapons or equipment , such an attack would be hard for the security services to detect			2
at least three plots which would have involved ' certain deaths ' in @entity4 have been foiled in recent months , mr @entity68 said			2
officials are also keeping tabs on up to 600 @entity4 extremists who have travelled to @entity60 – about 300 of who are now back home			2
following the warning , the chancellor @entity102 said he had handed the security services a new £ 100million anti-terror fund to track @entity4 lone - wolf extremists			1
mr @entity102 said the cash had been handed over ' in the last few weeks ' amid growing fears over the number of radicals returning from @entity111 and @entity60 to wreak terror in @entity4			2
he said the government would provide @entity69 and @entity114 with ' all the resources and all the legislation ' they need to prevent a terrorist atrocity in @entity4			1
but mr @entity68 , the director - general of @entity69 , said it was almost inevitable that an attack in @entity4 would succeed sooner or later			1
he said @entity67 was directing @entity4 - based fanatics from overseas to carry out attacks on airlines or a @entity125 - style gun and bomb atrocities			0
in a rare public speech , mr @entity68 warned : ' although we and our partners try our utmost , we know that we can not hope to stop everything			2
' mr @entity68 's speech , only his second since taking charge in april 2013 , warned that the @entity4 was facing a string of ' complex and ambitious plots ' against the likes of transport networks and major landmarks			2
in response to the attack on the @entity6 - based satirical magazine on wednesday , mr @entity102 said the threat to the @entity4 was ' severe ' – but insisted security chiefs would get whatever they needed			1
he said : ' it 's clearly a big challenge for all countries including @entity4 and we face a terrorist threat			0
we have a severe terrorist threat ; that is our national state of readiness			0
' we have put a huge amount of planning and effort , from the police , from the security services , from the government into anticipating what might try and happen , stopping some of these attacks and of course we have been successfully doing that over the last year			2
' in the last few weeks we have put extra money , over a hundred million pounds into specifically monitoring people who are going to conflicts in @entity60 and @entity111			0
' these sort of self - starting terrorists who get their ideas off the internet and then go and want to perpetrate horrendous crimes , so we are putting a huge effort in			0
' as the director general of @entity69 said over the last 24 hours , that is the threat we face and we face a threat from more complex plots			0
' warning : @entity68 ( pictured ) , the director - general of @entity69 , said it was almost inevitable an attack in @entity4 would succeed sooner or later the chancellor pledged to provide @entity69 and @entity114 with ' all the resources and all the legislation ' they need mr @entity102 promised that the security services would get ' all the resources and all the legislation ' necessary to prevent a terrorist attack in the @entity4			1
' we have got to be vigilant , we have got to have the resources there and my commitment is very clear			0
this is the national priority			0
we will put the resources in , whatever the security services need they will get because they do a heroic job on our behalf			2
' they often do n't get praise , they do n't often appear on sofas like this to talk about their work but they are absolutely in the front line with the police dealing with this threat and they will get the support they need and indeed in the last few weeks they have got that support			0
' ' our national threat level is severe and that means we assess independently , it is not the politicians who make this assessment but the experts make this assessment , that an attack is highly likely			0
' so , we have to be ready for that			0
we do n't have specific intelligence that an attack is imminent or else we would increase the threat level , but we think it is highly likely and we have to be prepared			0
we have had terrible incidents on our streets			0
' mr @entity102 's remarks came amid warnings that amid warnings that the threat to @entity4 was now ' as serious as it has ever been ' and the security services needed more powers to monitor fanatics			1
former foreign secretary sir @entity229 , the chairman of the joint intelligence committee , said the security services must have the power to intercept communications between suspected terrorists in order to prevent future attacks			2
he said : ' what is emerging in @entity6 is that the two individuals responsible for the terrible massacre at @entity240 , may have been linked to @entity67 in @entity241			0
' now they must have ben communicating with people in the @entity241 over the last few days , over the last few weeks			0
' the highly important objective is to enable the intelligence agencies in @entity4 , @entity246 and other democracies to be able to get hold of these communications to try and prevent incidents of this kind			0

lord @entity7 said the government should tighten restrictions on ammunition
he said the security services needed more powers to track terrorists online

@entity266 warning comes as security chiefs warn up to 150 jihadists are in @entity4
