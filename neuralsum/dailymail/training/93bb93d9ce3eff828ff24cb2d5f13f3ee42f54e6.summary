humans have used up the natural resources the @entity3 can provide for the year and are now in ' overdraft ' , campaigners have warned			2
the world has reached ' earth overshoot day ' , the point in the year that humans have exhausted supplies such land , trees and fish and outstripped the planet 's annual capacity to absorb waste products including carbon dioxide			1
for the rest of the year , the world is in ecological debt , with fish stocks and forests being depleted , land degraded and carbon dioxide building up in the atmosphere , the @entity16 said			1
the world has reached ' earth overshoot day ' , the point in the year that humans have exhausted supplies such land , trees and fish and outstripped the planet 's annual capacity to absorb waste products including carbon dioxide			1
pictured is the remnants of a forest that has been logged and deforested in @entity35 earth overshoot day is calculated by comparing the demands made by humans on global resources - our ' ecological footprint ' - with the planet 's ability to replenish resources and absorb waste			1
this year , in less than nine months we have used as much of nature as the @entity3 can regenerate in a year			2
earth overshoot day has fallen a couple of days earlier than it did last year			1
the @entity16 said that in 1961 , humanity only used around two - thirds of the available natural resources on @entity3 , but by the 1970s increased carbon emissions and consumption began to outstrip what the planet could provide			1
humans now need the equivalent of 1.5 planets to sustain us , and by mid century it will have risen to two planets , the campaigners said			2
@entity61 has the biggest total ecological footprint , because of its large population , but other countries have much higher demands on resources per person			0
if everyone were to live like @entity71 residents we would need four planets to supply demand , the report said			0
earth overshoot day is calculated by comparing the demands made by humans on global resources - our ' ecological footprint ' - with the planet 's ability to replenish resources and absorb waste four - fifths of the world 's population live in countries that use more than their own natural systems can provide			1
in this country , we would need the equivalent of three and a half @entity91 to sustain current consumption levels			0
not all countries use more than the resources within their own borders can provide but even their ' credit ' or reserves is shrinking , the campaigners warned			0
the world can no longer sustain the widening budget gap between what nature is able to provide and how much our infrastructure , economies and lifestyles require , they said			0
@entity105 , @entity16 regional director , said : ' everyday life in many @entity108 countries is showing us what it means to live beyond financial limits			2
' ecological and financial deficits are two sides of the same coin			0
over the long run , nations can not deal with one deficit without addressing the other			0
' the world can no longer sustain the widening budget gap between what nature is able to provide - such as with commercial fishing ( pictured ) - and how much our infrastructure , economies and lifestyles require , campaigners have warned @entity126 , climate economist at @entity127 , who came up with the concept of earth overshoot day at @entity130 think tank the @entity131 , said : ' the government consistently tells us that we must buckle down and live within our financial means , but seems intent on pushing us to break our environmental budget			1
' the maths is simple - the @entity130 consumes and produces waste at a rate three and a half times greater than we can sustain , and today humanity has already exhausted what the planet 's ecosystems can provide in a year			1
' we 're in the red and gambling with ecological bankruptcy , as the fracking debate shows			0
if it chose to , the government can always print more money , but it ca n't print more planet			0
ecological overshoot should lead the political agenda			0

the world has now reached ' earth overshoot day ' , the point in the year that humans have exhausted supplies such land , trees and fish
we have also outstripped the planet 's annual capacity to absorb waste products including carbon dioxide , the @entity16 says
