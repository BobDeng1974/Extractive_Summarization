experts warned of an ' undeniable growth ' in cases among the over- 60 age group @entity35 , pictured under the microscope , was the most common @entity23 , making up 47 per cent of all diagnoses - a total of 208,755 cases in 2013 @entity35 was the most common @entity23 , making up 47 per cent of all diagnoses - a total of 208,755 cases			1

however experts at the @entity55 warned of the ' undeniable growth ' of @entity23 in older people			1
@entity55 ’s @entity58 , @entity59 , said while many of the ' baby boom ' generation , growing up in the 1960s when the contraceptive pill was introduced may have never , or rarely used a condom			1
with a rise in the number of older people using dating websites , and enjoying sex later in life , he urged older people to be aware of the dangers of unprotected sex			0
he said : ' while increases in @entity23 diagnoses can in part be attributed to greater awareness and better testing programmes , there has been an undeniable growth of @entity23 among older age groups			1
' some of these people will be from the ‘ baby boom ’ generation who grew up in the 1960s when the contraceptive pill was introduced and may have never or rarely used condoms			1
' and with sexual health messaging often targeted at young people , men and women who come out of long - term relationships might find themselves with very little information and knowledge about @entity23			2
' we know that many are enjoying a new lease of life through internet dating , and enjoying sex is by no means the preserve of the young			0
' while they might not need to worry about the risks of becoming pregnant anymore , they might not think about the other type of protection which is offered by condoms			0
the highest number of cases of all @entity23 was among the 15 - 24 age group ' what is particularly worrying is the fact that people over 45 now will have been sexually active around the time of the high - profile and effective condom - use messages of the 1980s and 90s , but perhaps these have been forgotten			1
' dr @entity114 , consultant scientist in @entity7 ’s @entity23 surveillance team , said : ' sustained efforts to encourage people to regularly get checked for @entity23 means we are now finding and treating more infections – which is good news			0
' nevertheless these data show too many people are still getting @entity23 each year , especially young adults and gay men			0
' investment in promoting good sexual health awareness , contraception and condom use , and @entity23 testing is vital , as is ongoing investment in easy to access sexual health services that meet the needs of local populations			0
' not only will this help bring down @entity23 rates but abortion rates and under 18 conceptions as well			0
' national guidance recommends local services routinely offer chlamydia screening to young adults but only 15 per cent of young men and 35 per cent of young women were tested in 2013			0
wide variations were seen across the country in the rates of chlamydia testing and diagnoses – with only around a third of local authorities reaching the recommended chlamydia screening levels ( 2,300 diagnoses per 100,000 young adults per year )			0
clamydia in males was most prevalent in the 20 to 24 age group , while in women the highest number of cases was among those aged 15 to 19 dr @entity114 , added : ' @entity35 can have serious consequences , including infertility , if it ’s not treated			1
' these data show we need to do more to encourage young adults to ask for testing every year when they attend health services			0
' local areas can look at embedding screening into a variety of settings to make it as easy as possible for this group to get tested			0
' offering a young adult a chlamydia test opens the door to conversations about other important aspects of good sexual health , such as contraception and condom use			0
' people can significantly reduce their risk of catching or passing on an @entity23 by consistently and correctly using condoms until all partners have had a sexual health screen , by reducing the number of sexual partners , and by avoiding overlapping sexual relationships .			2
