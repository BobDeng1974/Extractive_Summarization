@entity0 recently played host to an @entity3 comet flyby , providing an unprecedented chance to expand our understanding of the solar system			1
@entity8 passed within 87,000 miles ( 140,000 km ) of @entity0 , less than half the distance between @entity10 and its moon , and much closer than any comet has ever come to @entity10			0
now , @entity13 has released data suggesting that the chemistry of @entity0 ' atmosphere could be changed forever from the flyby , which only happens once every eight million years			1
@entity8 passed within 87,000 miles ( 140,000 km ) of @entity0 ( artist 's impression pictured in a flyby which only happens once every eight million years the comet 's dust likely produced a meteor shower when particles hit it the upper atmosphere , ' literally changing the chemistry , ' said @entity34 , director of @entity13 's planetary science division			1
as well as adding a new layer of ions to the @entity0 atmosphere , the speeding comet - which travelled at 35 miles per second ( 56km per second ) - produced what was described as a meteor storm			1
experts describe the scene , with thousands of shooting stars per hour and the entire sky changing colour as ' mind blowing '			0
' it 's extremely rare in human history			2
it would have been truly stunning to the human eye , ' said planetary scientist @entity52 , with the @entity53			0
the comet 's dust produced a meteor shower when particles hit it the upper atmosphere , ' literally changed the chemistry , ' said @entity34 , director of @entity13 's planetary science division ( artist 's impression pictured ) @entity61 comes from the @entity3 , material left over from the formation of the solar system			1
' this comet is coming into the solar system straight from the @entity3			1
it 's likely this is its first time this close to the sun , ' said space scientist @entity71 , of the @entity73 ( @entity73 ) in @entity74 , @entity75			0
@entity3 material , including comets , is scattered through a vast region that begins outside the orbits of @entity80 and @entity81 and extends a substantial fraction of the distance to @entity84 , the closest neighboring star			0
@entity3 comets can tell scientists about the materials - including water and carbon compounds - that existed during the formation of the solar system some 4.6 billion years ago			1
the images above show - before and after filtering - comet @entity61 , also known as @entity61 , as captured by @entity94 on @entity13 's @entity95 studying this close encounter was the largest fleet of orbiting scientific observatories ever flown to another world , orbiting around ( and rolling on the ground of ) @entity0			2
these instruments will , for the first time ever , have the chance to make close - up observations of a comet new to the inner solar system			2
and though it will not be the easiest task , the teams operating these instruments and spacecraft have developed plans to take advantage of this rare opportunity			0
siding spring is small ( the nucleus is less than a mile in diameter ) and fast ( it passed @entity0 at about 34 miles / 55 kilometres per second )			0
the instruments on various spacecraft observed the comet repeatedly for two and a half days as it got closer and closer to @entity0 before it made its closest approach			0
the peak density of comet dust at @entity0 was expected 98 minutes after closest approach of the nucleus			2
this graphic shows the science observations that was hoped to be captured by @entity13 's @entity0 spacecraft during the close encounter with @entity61 ( @entity61 ) although the comet eventually left @entity0 far behind , its impact could have long - standing effects on the planet , claims @entity132 in @entity133			1
instruments on @entity134 detected eight different types of metal ions in the comet dust : sodium , magnesium , potassium , chromium , manganese , iron , nickel , and zinc			0
@entity13 says that eventually these metals will revert to dust in a process known as meteoric smoke			0
the introduction of all of this new dust into the @entity0 atmosphere may produce high - altitude clouds above the planet 's surface and could affect its interaction with sunlight			1
these images were taken of comet c / 2013 @entity160 by @entity13 's @entity162 on 19 october 2014 during the comet 's close flyby of @entity0 and the spacecraft			1
it is the highest - resolution image of a comet that heralds from the @entity3 at the edge of the solar system ever taken as well as this , the chemistry of the atmosphere might be permanently altered			1
the comet was a rare visitor from the @entity3 , a spherically shaped reservoir beyond @entity80 's orbit containing leftovers from the formation of the solar system some 4.6 billion years ago			1
the interest in examining the properties of the comet dust does n't end with its effects on @entity0			2
' we believe that comets were formed very early , much earlier than the @entity10 was , ' mr @entity34 said			0
studying @entity61 may offer unique insight into the content of the collapsing cloud that formed the solar system , he said			2
this image of @entity61 was taken by astronomers @entity192 and @entity193 using the @entity194 in @entity195			0
the comet is the blue - ish object towards the middle of the picture , with its tail seen streaking backwards			0
@entity0 is the bright sun - like object in the middle , overexposed to reveal the comet			2

@entity0 played host to extremely rare @entity3 comet flyby in october
the speeding comet produced a huge meteor storm on the red planet
@entity13 says chemistry of @entity0 may have changed *due* to comet 's dust
@entity217 may produce high - clouds changing @entity0 ' interaction with the sun
@entity222 may offer insights into solar system formation
