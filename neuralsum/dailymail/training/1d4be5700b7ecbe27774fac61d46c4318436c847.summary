by @entity0 @entity2 chief executive @entity1 has apologised for the ' hurt and upset ' caused by the decision to finish the @entity4 following the death of caddie @entity6			1
@entity7 suffered a fatal heart attack on the ninth hole at @entity10 and although an indefinite suspension of play was initially announced , the decision was later taken to resume the event , which had already been reduced to 36 holes due to bad weather			1
many players and caddies criticised that decision and @entity1 held an ' emotional ' meeting with the @entity19 during the @entity20 this week , a meeting also attended by players ’ tournament committee chairman @entity23			1
apology : @entity26 acknowledged the ' hurt and upset ' caused by actions at the @entity4 in a statement on the @entity2 website , @entity1 said : ' we had a full and frank meeting with chairman @entity32 and his committee , a meeting which was understandably emotional at times and one during which i apologised to them for the hurt and upset caused by events in @entity40			1
' i completely understand the views of people who say that we should not have carried on , but it was a terrible situation for anyone to be in and the decision to finish the tournament was not taken lightly , either by myself or by the tournament officials on the ground in @entity40			1
' however , that decision is in the past and the important thing now is that we continue to work with @entity52 ’s family and friends - as we have done from last sunday - to assist with arrangements surrounding the funeral , which will take place in @entity40 next thursday , the same day as we wear " @entity59 " at @entity60 ( during the first round of the @entity58 )			2
' i have also personally instructed a review of how we deal , operationally , at tournaments with situations such as this so that we can ensure the lessons of @entity40 are learned			2
' @entity1 also paid tribute to @entity67 , whose bag @entity6 was carrying at the time			0
' throughout this whole process @entity67 has behaved like a true gentleman in incredibly challenging circumstances , ' @entity1 added			0
' he accepted our decision to play on in @entity40 with grace and dignity and he should command enormous respect for the way he has conducted himself throughout this difficult week			0
' upset : caddie @entity6 suffered a heart attack and died but the tournament continued regardless @entity32 , chairman of the @entity19 , said : ' we as a committee have faced an extremely tough week			1
dealing with the passing of our colleague and friend during a tournament is particularly upsetting			2
' while we understand that decisions have to be made at very short notice , it will come as no surprise to anyone that all @entity2 caddies felt the wrong one was made in @entity40			0
' we went into the meeting unhappy and it was emotional at times , but @entity1 ’s humility and honesty in dealing with tough questions was greatly appreciated and it reassured us of the caddies ’ important position within the @entity2			0
' we can now look forward to celebrating @entity6 ’s life next thursday and strengthening our links with the @entity2 moving forwards			0
