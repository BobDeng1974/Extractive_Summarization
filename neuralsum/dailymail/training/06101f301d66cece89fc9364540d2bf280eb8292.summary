by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 03:28 est , 30 august 2013 updated : 10:16 est , 30 august 2013 @entity3 ’s standing on the world stage has suffered an unprecedented blow , with @entity6 mocked on both sides of the @entity8 for failing to back president @entity9 in intervening in @entity10			1
urgent calls were made to the @entity12 last night soon after the government defeat amid claims by one @entity16 official that @entity3 had ‘ handed back its deputy sheriff badge ’			2
but @entity19 newspapers were united in their view that the ' normally reliable @entity21 ' had ' balked ' at the prospect of a new conflict in the @entity24 , leaving mr @entity9 to go it alone			2
diplomatic experts also voiced deep concerns that the repercussions for @entity3 ’s standing on the world stage would be long - lasting			1
the @entity44 front page today was the most striking in the @entity19 today , featuring a glum picture of mr @entity9 with the headline : the @entity3 are n't coming ! the @entity3 are n't coming ! ' the @entity47 said ' @entity19 prepares for solo strike on @entity10 after @entity3 balks ' while the @entity49 said mr @entity6 had suffered a ' stunning parliamentary defeat ' which was a ' sign of @entity6 's weakness '			1
the @entity52 said last night 's commons vote has damaged @entity3 's reputation as a major global power and also sent a worrying message to dictators , while the @entity58 ( @entity58 ) said it was an embarrassment			0
the @entity47 front page read : ' @entity19 prepares for solo strike on @entity10 after @entity3 balks ' the @entity62 said : ' @entity12 : @entity9 can go it along on @entity10 ' the @entity65 front page read : ' in face of resistance , @entity9 is ready to act alone ' the @entity49 said : ' @entity9 set for limited strike on @entity10 as @entity3 vote no ' former @entity70 leader @entity70 said the defeat in the @entity72 had left the @entity3 a ‘ hugely diminished country ’			1
the influential @entity75 grassroots website @entity76 said mr @entity6 had suffered ' the worst foreign policy defeat in modern times '			0
mr @entity6 had promised mr @entity9 he would stand should to shoulder with the @entity19 in taking military action against the @entity81 regime after the devastating chemical weapons attack in @entity83 last week			1
but he now faces the prospect of attending next week 's @entity86 summit in @entity87 as a much diminished figure , unable to make commit @entity3 's military might while sitting around the negotiating table with the world 's most powerful leaders			1
to add further embarrassment , @entity94 president @entity93 said his country was prepared to stand alongside @entity19 and ' punish ' @entity10 leader @entity81			1
he said : ‘ the chemical massacre at @entity83 can not and must not remain unpunished			0
otherwise , we take the risk of an escalation that would normalise the use of these weapons , and threaten other countries			0
' each country is free to choose whether to take part in such an operation or not			0
that holds true for @entity3 and @entity94			1
' prime minister @entity6 recalled @entity108 to stage an emergency vote to endorse @entity3 involvement in missile strikes			1
but @entity112 voted by 272 votes to 285 to reject mr @entity6 ’s motion backing @entity3 intervention in principle			2
it is the first time that @entity108 has voted against the government on a matter of war and peace since 1782 , and raises the prospect of the @entity19 having to go it alone			1
mr @entity32 said : ‘ it ’s certainly going to place some strain on the special relationship			2
’ he said the @entity19 ‘ have been surprised by the scale of opposition in @entity108 , and perhaps they will struggle a bit to understand the very special reasons that there are for that view in @entity108 ’			0
@entity134 sources stressed that there had been ‘ understanding ’ from the @entity12 about the outcome of the vote			0
but there was acknowledgement that it permanently altered the assumption that @entity3 and the @entity19 would act together in military operations around the world			1
chancellor mr @entity31 insisted the relationship with the @entity19 is a ‘ very old one , very deep and operates on many layers ’ and there had been ' a bit of hyperbole ' about the impact of the vote			2
but he suggested the @entity3 was now at a crucial crossroads in deciding the role it plays in global politics			2
‘ i think there will be a national soul - searching about our role in the world and whether @entity3 wants to play a big part in upholding the international system , be that big open and trading nation that i 'd like us to be or whether we turn our back on that , ’ he told @entity160 ’s today programme			1
‘ i understand the deep scepticism that my colleagues in @entity108 many members of the public have about @entity3 involvement in @entity10			0
‘ i hope this does n’t become the moment where we turn our back on the world ’s problems			0
’ @entity12 officials cautiously suggested mr @entity9 was prepared to launch strikes against @entity10 without @entity3 support			2
but asked if the @entity19 would go it alone , @entity12 spokesman @entity183 said : ‘ the opinion of others in this situation matters			0
’ @entity19 defence secretary @entity188 said @entity19 still wanted to secure international backing for any military intervention			1
speaking during a trip to the @entity192 , he said : ' it is the goal of president @entity9 and our government ... whatever decision is taken , that it be an international collaboration and effort			0
' our approach is to continue to find an international coalition that will act together			0
and i think you 're seeing a number of countries state , publicly state , their position on the use of chemical weapons			0
' debate : a chastened mr @entity6 was forced by @entity210 leader @entity209 to pledge not to deploy any @entity3 military forces without first staging another @entity72 vote but @entity213 , a @entity24 analyst for the @entity215 - based @entity214 , told @entity216 that the vote ‘ complicates life and this has bigger implications about the nature of the relationship between the @entity19 and its closest ally ’			1
dr @entity224 , executive director of the trans - @entity8 think tank the @entity52 , said : ‘ if not reversed , this vote means the @entity3 will join the rank of third - rate nations , condemned to be the prisoner of events and with no power to shape them			2
‘ this is a shameful result which will not be readily forgotten by our allies			0
we can be certain that more atrocities will follow in @entity10			0
’ @entity58 director general professor @entity237 said the decision not to go ahead with military intervention would prove an embarrassment for @entity3 on the international stage			2
@entity242 : @entity19 defense secretary @entity188 told reporters during a visit to the @entity192 that @entity19 would still consult @entity3 alarm : defence secretary @entity32 ( left ) said the @entity72 vote put the special relationship under ' strain ' while chancellor @entity31 warned @entity3 against turning its back on the world @entity70 , who appeared in front of @entity252 with leader @entity253 yesterday in an attempt to persuade rebels to back the government , wrote on @entity257 : ‘ in 50 years trying to serve my country i have never felt so depressed / ashamed			1
@entity3 's answer to the @entity10 horrors ? none of our business ! ’ labour leader @entity209 insisted that the @entity3 - @entity19 relationship ' remains strong ' despite last night 's vote			1
he said : ' i do think there 's a lesson for @entity3 , though , which is that we must lead in the right way for @entity3 from our national interest and indeed our global interest			0
' now sometimes that will mean agreeing with what @entity19 is doing and the way it 's going about things , and sometimes it will mean doing things in a different way			0

@entity19 media mock ' weak ' @entity6 for failing to deliver support for great ally
last time any *pm* was defeated over issue of war and peace was in 1782
@entity3 faces ' soul - searching ' about role in the world , says @entity31
defence secretary @entity32 warns of ' strain ' on @entity19 relations
@entity94 now says it is prepared to take military action without @entity3
