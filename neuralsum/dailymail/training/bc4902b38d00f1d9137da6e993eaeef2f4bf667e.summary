the government ’s emergency committee was convened today to discuss the devastating disease which is threatening @entity4 ’s ash trees			1
environment secretary @entity7 chaired a meeting of @entity9 with officials from @entity11 , government agencies and scientists to consider how to stem the spread of the killer fungus ash dieback			1
ministers have been warned the disease is untreatable , with an estimated 100,000 trees already destroyed after being found to be infected			1
the @entity9 will discuss how to respond to the ash crisis , which could see 80million trees destroyed the government 's chief scientific adviser briefed the hour - long @entity22 meeting , which included officials from the @entity24 and the devolved administrations			1
mr @entity7 said : ' we have had an assessment of the state of the disease			1
' we also had an assessment of the current survey , where we are looking at 2,900 10km squares right across the @entity4			2
this was a meeting that brought in the devolved administrations in @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 showing that , right across the @entity4 , we are determined to work together			1
' we also had a presentation on possible solutions - at the moment we do not have a cure for the disease - and also measures we might take having established the survey , which should be completed by the middle of next week			0
' on monday mr @entity7 imposed a ban on the import of ash trees amid predictions the ‘ devastating disease ’ could wipe out 80million @entity4 trees			1
scientists have warned tackling the crisis would ' change the countryside significantly			0
' however , mr @entity7 has been accused by a @entity55 mp of dither and delay in taking @entity58 said the @entity59 that ministers should have acted eight months ago when reports first came through that the ash dieback disease had entered the country			1
he has put down a parliamentary motion demanding that ministers plough money into research into plant health and a new rapid reaction force to deal with disease threats			2
mr @entity58 , the environmentalist mp for @entity71 in south west @entity72 , said : ' the government is finally doing the right thing , but it took far , far too long , and for ash at least , it may be too late			1
we should have sprung into action when the fungus was found over eight months ago			0
environment secretary @entity7 has been accused by @entity55 mp @entity80 of not acting fast enough to tackle the crisis ' we have already seen that the longer these problems are ignored , the greater the cost of dealing with them , which is why we need more resources to be allocated now to prevention and rapid reaction			1
' among other things , that means better screening and control at our borders by government , and more use by the horticultural and landscaping industry of our domestic nurseries			2
' we need a different approach ; one that puts biosecurity ahead of promiscuous trade			0
' mr @entity7 will be challenged about his handling of the crisis when he is grilled by the @entity105 select committee on tuesday			2
@entity108 chairman @entity107 , a @entity55 mp , said there are ' many questions to be answered '			2
' the government needs to me more alert to plant health			0
i want to know when the department first knew about this			0
the @entity117 say they first wrote to @entity118 about the disease in 2009 - i will be asking him about that			0
' successive governments have been underfunding plant health			0
the department is now increasing the funding available , but why did they not do this before ? ' she added : ' i want to know why we are importing ash saplings			0
why do we rely so heavily on imports for so many popular trees ? ' are saplings more prone to this disease ? how will it impact on mature trees , and have we become more prone because of the extreme wet weather we have been having ? ' and i will be asking whether there are any other potential diseases threatening popular trees			0
