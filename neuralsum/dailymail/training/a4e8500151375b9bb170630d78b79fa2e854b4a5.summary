the @entity9 has written to @entity10 , who is @entity11 by birth , warning him he could be ' forcibly removed ' from the @entity8			1
he has lived in @entity13 , @entity14 , with his mother @entity15 , since june last year			1
@entity10 ( left ) has been warned he could be ' forcibly removed ' from the @entity8			1
he has lived in @entity14 with his mother @entity15 ( right ) since june last year his mother , who has dual @entity8 and @entity11 citizenship , said she did not think she would need a visa for @entity10 for her home country just because he is @entity11 by birth			1
she has now said she is ' horrified , angry and upset ' at the actions of the @entity9 after they sent a letter warning @entity10 he could be deported			1
ms @entity23 moved to @entity24 in 2007 where she met her partner @entity26 when @entity10 was a toddler			1
upon arriving in the @entity8 from @entity24 in 2012 , ms @entity23 was told her son could not enter the @entity8 legally			1
@entity10 was issued with a six - month visitor visa and ms @entity23 was told to resolve the issue with the @entity9			1
but she said she could not afford about £ 1,000 for a special visa for her son			0
upon arriving in the @entity8 from @entity24 in 2012 , ms @entity23 was told her son could not enter the @entity8 legally acting on advice ms @entity23 and her @entity24 - born fiancé mr @entity26 decided he should apply for a residency card and then have @entity10 registered as his dependent			1
but she said the @entity9 rejected the application and her young son could now be forcibly removed from the country			1
in its letter the @entity9 said it did not receive the correct evidence to support the application			1
it goes on to say : ' as you appear to have no alternative basis of stay in the @entity8 you should now make arrangements to leave			2
ms @entity23 's other children , @entity43 ( right ) and @entity44 ( centre ) are not affected by the ruling			2
the children are pictured with ms @entity23 and her partner @entity49 ' if you fail to do so voluntarily your departure may be enforced			0
' ms @entity23 's other children , @entity43 , three , and @entity44 , 11 months , are not affected by the ruling			2
ms @entity23 said : ' they have @entity10 ’s birth certificate and passport			2
i have two other @entity59 - born children here , i ca n’t just pick up and leave , it is ridiculous			0
' i have been told that @entity10 should have a visa , this had just never occurred to me			2
' no one ever asked me any questions about his passport when we went to other @entity59 countries			0
' then to come to one of my home countries , i would never have considered it			0
' the letter from the @entity9 landed at the family ’s home on ms @entity23 's birthday on saturday			1
she said she is yet to explain to @entity10 what is happening			2
' i have not attempted to tell him			0
i am worried about his mental state , i do not want to upset him			0
what mother would want to explain to their child that their government wants them out ? ' ms @entity23 said it was ' particularly stressful ' making the application while pregnant with her third child			0
she said : ' during the time of all of this , trying to communication with the @entity89 , i was also heavily pregnant with my daughter , so it was particularly stressful			0
' ms @entity23 said they were due to appeal the @entity9 's decision			1
the family ’s plea to keep @entity10 in the @entity8 has been backed by @entity14 mp dr @entity96			1
he said : ' you would have thought that the immigration department had better things to do than harass a seven - year - old child			0
' this is one of those situations which the rules and regulations clearly do not properly cater for			0
' they would n’t even know which country to send him to			0
so it is farcical to carry on like this			0
' there is no court in the land that is going to split up a mother from her child			0
the whole thing is ludicrous bureaucracy			0
' a @entity9 spokesman said : ' all applications are considered on their individual merits and in line with the @entity121 rules			2
' the onus is on the individual to provide the necessary evidence to support their application			0

@entity10 , 7 , has been warned he could ' forcibly removed ' from the @entity8
he has been living in @entity14 with his mother , who has @entity8 citizenship
