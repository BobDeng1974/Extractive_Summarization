by @entity0 published : 06:25 est , 28 september 2012 updated : 08:43 est , 28 september 2012 bitter victory : @entity2 got her car back from the clampers , but found an unwelcome surprise in the boot a woman who won a six - month legal battle against a clamping firm says her car was returned to her - with a dead rat in the boot			1
@entity2 has accused the company @entity12 of leaving the animal corpse in her vehicle as an act of revenge after she took the firm to court in a private prosecution			1
the mother - of - two was so incensed her @entity19 was towed away from a car park in @entity21 , @entity22 , that she refused to pay the £ 390 fine to release it			1
instead , the university lecturer pursued company boss @entity25 , 48 , through the criminal courts in a rare private prosecution			1
the clamper , of @entity29 , @entity22 , appeared before @entity22 magistrates charged with theft of a vehicle and failing to disclose the address of @entity34 to mrs @entity2			1
the charges were eventually dropped following out - of - court negotiations when @entity25 agreed to hand back the car and pay the single mum £ 200 compensation			1
however mrs @entity2 , 44 , of @entity41 , made a horrifying discovery when the @entity43 was returned to her six months after it was towed away			1
she said : ' my car was beginning to smell and initially i thought someone may have urinated on the back seats , but i finally tracked the smell down to a dead rat under my spare tyre			1
' there ’s no way a rat could get in there as it is an enclosed space , so i can only assume someone left me a little present			2
' mrs @entity2 believes the rat ( pictured ) , which was found under her spare tyre , was place there deliebrately			1
however , this has been denied by the owner of the clamping company nasty surprise : mrs @entity2 said she found the rat after noticing a bad smell coming from her car @entity25 has vehemently denied the allegations , saying : ' the car was in a compound for over six months , right next to the railway bank where there ’s always a lot of rats			1
' i did not put the rat there but i ’m not surprised it was there as we have had quite a few cars where rats have worked their way inside and eaten through all the wires and seats			0
' despite her encounter with the rodent , mrs @entity2 said she was ' over the moon ' at her legal victory			2
in normal circumstances , people are charged and prosecute by the police and the @entity93			0
however , every citizen has the right to bring a private case through criminal courts , thanks to the @entity98			0
anyone who wants to take private action must initially apply through magistrates courts , which is what mrs @entity2 did			2
a magistrate would need to hear the reasons behind the prosecution , before signing a summons to start the legal process			0
the case is then treated like any other prosecution			0
despite her encounter with the rodent , mrs @entity2 said she was ' over the moon ' with her legal victory - and getting her car back mrs @entity2 said of her legal action : ' i ’m delighted , i feel like it is a moral victory			1
' @entity118 was my car back , the compensation was irrelevant			1
' it was about getting justice and getting my car back , which i felt had effectively been stolen from me			1
' the episode began back in march this year when mrs @entity2 inadvertently parked on private land			1
she took her daughters , aged 10 and 13 , to their piano exams , only to return an hour later to see her car on a tow truck			2
she said : ' i flagged the truck down and asked what was going on , but they refused to tell me anything other than to phone the number on the sign			0
' they pointed to a sign way up high on a wall , which said cars would be clamped if parked there			0
it was the first time i ’d seen the sign as it was so high up			0
' my daughters were in floods of tears			0
' mrs @entity2 then phoned @entity34 , where her car had been taken to a compound , only to be told she would have to pay £ 390 to free the vehicle			1
it was from this location in @entity22 - which she later discovered was private property - that mrs @entity2 's car was towed away she was also warned she would be charged an extra £ 40 for each day it was left there			1
she added : ' i was told i would have to pay cash , but i could n’t afford it			0
' i asked if i could pay on credit card but they refused to allow me to			2
' i was not going to give in that easily - i knew that i had to take legal action			0
' not having a car for six months has been a huge inconvenience , but i was determined to get it back			2
' @entity25 defended the decision to tow away mrs @entity2 ’s car			2
he said : ' at the end of the day she was parked illegally on private land			0
i decided to return her car and pay her the money for it [ the charges ] to go away			1
' i am innocent but i do n’t want the hassle or legal costs involved			0
' the clamper sparked outrage earlier this year when he boasted to the media that he had earned more than £ 10million by clamping city drivers			0
however , he later dismissed his own claims , saying the statement was meant as ' a joke '			0
@entity25 is well - known to @entity179 ’s @entity178 team , who have received complaints from motorists about @entity183			0
a number of clamping victims , including 20 - year - old @entity187 student @entity186 , have sued the firm in civil courts to win back their fines			2
@entity191 , @entity178 operations manager , said : ' we are aware of @entity183 clamping and towing vehicles from their sites			0
this includes where motorists are just a few minutes late			0

@entity2 's car was towed away while she took her daughters to an after - *school* club
she refused to pay the fine and instead took the owner of the company to court in a private prosecution
the charges were dropped when the matter was settled out of court and the firm agreed to return her vehicle and pay her compensation
when she got the car back she discovered a dead rat in the space *underneath* her spare tyre
