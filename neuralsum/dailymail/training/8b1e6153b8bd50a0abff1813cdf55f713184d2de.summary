care minister @entity0 warned the issue of social care could not be left in the ' long grass ' a @entity5 minister has launched a last - minute plea for @entity7 to set aside money to end the scandal of pensioners having to sell their homes to fund sky - high care bills			1
@entity0 , the care services minister , said the issue of social care for the elderly was far too important to be kicked into the ‘ long grass ’ yet again			1
in a strongly worded intervention just days before the @entity17 launches its mid-term review , he told the chancellor : ‘ we have just got to get on with it			0
’ mr @entity0 has been joined by three @entity23 - run councils which have written to @entity24 urging a cap of £ 35,000 on the amount people have to pay			1
one of them , @entity29 , yesterday launched a national petition on the @entity32 website demanding the imposition of a cap			2
under @entity40 ’s current system , pensioners with assets of £ 23,500 or more – including the value of their homes – have to pay unlimited care charges			1
it means that every year , at least 20,000 have to sell their homes to pay for care			2
two years ago an independent commission led by economist @entity45 suggested these charges should be subject to a lifetime cap of around £ 35,000 , with the state paying the rest			0
but mr @entity7 has baulked at the £ 1.7billion - a - year cost , and there are fears that to reduce the cost to the @entity55 , the cap could be set at up to £ 75,000			0
yesterday former care services minister @entity56 called for the winter fuel payment , which goes to all pensioners regardless of wealth , to be means tested to free up money for a cap			1
he said the handout , worth around £ 200 a year , should be limited to those on pension credit			0
the money saved would help fund a cap of £ 60,000			1
the government is under pressure to commit to the @entity71 reforms to stop people having to sell their homes to pay for care mr @entity56 said : ‘ social care is n’t free , but it could be a lot fairer for those who have worked hard all their lives			1
’ now his successor , mr @entity0 , has joined the fray			2
he urged the government to commit to a cap and work out how it is paid later on			0
former care minister @entity56 said radical help was needed to end the ' misery ' of huge social care bills on monday @entity24 and @entity85 will unveil their mid-term review : the @entity17 ’s priorities in the run - up to the next election			1
social care is expected to be at its heart			0
mr @entity0 said : ‘ we have just got to get on with it			2
we have got to announce it is going to happen , set the cap and legislate for it in the care and support @entity99 in the next session			2
’ mr @entity0 said decisions on how the cap could be funded – whether through cuts , tax rises or restrictions in means - tested benefits – could be made later			1
he added : ‘ my absolute determination is to get the principle in legislation so we have that debate rather than it remaining in the long grass			1
’ meanwhile three @entity23 councils – @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115 – have written to mr @entity24 calling for a cap of £ 35,000 to be imposed by 2015			0
@entity117 , leader of @entity29 , has also launched a no 10 petition , which needs 100,000 signatures to force a @entity121 debate			0
‘ the system we are currently working with is simply not up to the job any more , ’ he said			0
‘ i believe that the whole nation wants the situation sorted out			0
it ’s time to make it happen			0
