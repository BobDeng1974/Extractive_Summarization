by @entity0 published : 09:50 est , 13 june 2013 updated : 09:50 est , 13 june 2013 @entity1 may have confirmed much of the speculation surrounding its upcoming products its recent annual developer conference , but that has n't stopped the rumour mill from turning			2
the latest claims are that the @entity9 - based company is set to launch a low - cost version of its @entity12 handset as early as september			1
dubbed the @entity14 , the new handset could be made of plastic to keep costs down and may be sold in a range of colours including white , black , pink and blue			1
accessory manufacturer @entity20 published a picture of a cheap , plastic @entity12 model earlier this year			1
the design is rumoured to have a 3.5inch screen and @entity26 camera and could cost as little as £ 63 ( $ 99 )			0
industry analyst @entity27 fueled these rumours further when he made reference to a cheap @entity14 during a note to investors			1
the low - cost handset is expected to come in a range of colours and go on sale in september rumours fueled by an investor note , writeen by industry analyst @entity27 from @entity38 claims @entity1 is working on a low - cost handset			1
dubbed ' @entity14 ' the new handset could come in a range of colours , be made of plastic , have a 3.5inch screen and a @entity26 camera			1
prices being quoted range from £ 63 ( $ 99 ) to £ 260 ( $ 400 )			0
@entity1 is also believed to working on large - screen device for its @entity49 model			1
the @entity12 6 could have a 4.7inch screen			2
there may also be a 5.7inch screen @entity12 model due next year			1
these current rumours originated in a note to investors written by industry analyst @entity27 from @entity38			1
according to @entity56 , @entity27 cited research suggesting that the @entity14 would come in five colours , be made of plastic and could cost as little as £ 63 ( $ 99 )			2
other prices put it much higher at £ 260 ( $ 400 )			0
the current @entity12 is made of glass and anodised aluminium - the same material that is used to make @entity1 laptops			1
this design makes it feel sturdy but pushes the price of construction up			0
the @entity14 could follow @entity70 's lead and have a glass front with a plastic case			0
@entity1 traditionally unveils new handsets at an annual event in september and @entity27 believes this year 's event will be dominated by the rumoured @entity76			2
@entity27 claims that the @entity14 could be announced before this event so not to distract from the @entity76 launch , but @entity1 will likely show off both handsets together			1
the @entity80 also reported that accessory manufacturer @entity20 had published a picture of a cheap , plastic @entity12 model , rumoured to have a 3.5inch screen and @entity26 camera			1
this mock - up shows what @entity1 's larger @entity49 handset could look like			1
it was designed by @entity92 technology site @entity90			0
the @entity93 is due to be released in 2014 and is expected to have a 4.7inch screen			0
rumours claim that @entity1 could also be working on a 5.7inch ' phablet - style ' handset mr @entity27 added the @entity14 might ' have a curved back casing made of coloured plastic and will be thicker than the @entity12			1
' other rumours to have generated from @entity27 's note include that the @entity12 6 - expected in 2014 - will have a much larger screen than the current 4inch iphone 5 model			1
@entity1 could launch a 4.7inch model - which would put it in close competition with @entity70 's 4.8inch @entity106 - as well as a 5.7inch ' phablet - style ' device			1
these rumours are said to have come from sources within the phone maker 's supply chain in @entity112			0
according to @entity114 , these suppliers have been approached with plans for the larger screens , but noted it is still unclear whether @entity1 will actually launch its flagship product in the larger sizes			0
' they constantly change product specifications almost to the final moment , so you 're not really sure whether this is the final prototype , ' said one person said to have ' direct knowledge of the matter			0
' speaking at last month 's @entity127 on why @entity1 has n't launched different sized @entity128 , ceo @entity129 , pictured , said : ' we have n't so far			0
that does n't shut off the future			0
' @entity129 noted a larger screen comes with trade - offs on features such as battery life , resolution and brightness @entity1 's possible shift to offer what is often referred to as ' phablets ' - chunkier smartphones not quite big enough to qualify as tablets - comes as the long - time consumer and investor faces pressure to deliver more than one new handset model a year			1
critics say its pace of innovation has slowed since the death of legendary co-founder @entity152 - a reference @entity154 , @entity1 's senior vice president of worldwide marketing , made during the keynote speech at @entity1 's developer conference in @entity157 this week when he said : ' ca n't innovate any more , my ass			2
' the @entity12 5 , launched last september , was the first model to veer away from the @entity1 phone 's 3.5 - inch screen , which @entity152 famously deemed ' the perfect size for consumers ' and had been used in every iphone since the iconic device was unveiled in 2007			1
the current @entity12 has one of the smaller screens among the best - selling smartphones in the mobile market			2
@entity70 's @entity170 and @entity171 have 5 - inch and 5.5 - inch screens , respectively			0
@entity1 launched its 4inch iphone 5 handset at an annual event in @entity157 , in september last year			2
it is made of aluminium and glass , which makes it feel sturdy , but this pushes up production costs			2
the cheaper @entity14 is expected to have the plastic casing as seen on @entity181 models for this year , @entity1 is expected to launch two new models , widely referred to as the @entity76 , with new fingerprint technology , and the cheaper version in plastic casing			1
@entity1 plans to dress up the cheaper phone in a range of five or six colours to differentiate it from the more expensive model that has traditionally come only in black and white			1
analysts say the company needs a cheaper gadget to push on in growth markets in @entity194 and @entity195 , and to counter @entity70 's edge in having phones priced up and down the spectrum			0
@entity194 , the world 's biggest smartphone market , is set to grow 48 percent this year , outpacing the global increase of 31 percent , according to industry forecasts			0
while @entity1 only offers a single phone model across all markets , it has successfully marketed the @entity207 music player and its @entity208 in different sizes and at varying prices			2
if the new @entity14 launches as expected , it will more than likely run @entity1 's latest mobile software - @entity211 7			2
this software was unveiled this week at @entity1 's developer conference and will be available as a free upgrade in the @entity216 asked at last month 's @entity127 conference why @entity1 has n't launched different sized @entity128 , ceo @entity129 said : ' we have n't so far			0
that does n't shut off the future			0
' he explained that the range of ipods serve different audiences and needs			0
' on the phone , that 's the question			0
are we now at a point to serve enough people that we need to do that ? ' @entity129 noted a larger screen comes with trade - offs on features such as battery life , resolution and brightness			0
test production for both the standard and cheaper @entity12 models aims to start next month , with mass production ramping up in august to meet a september launch target , two people said			2
' trial production was originally planned to start in june , but the mixing of colours is taking longer than expected as @entity1 has very high and idealistic standards , ' said one source in @entity112 , adding 20 million plastic iphones are expected to ship in the october - december quarter			1
@entity253 's @entity252 and @entity251 and @entity255 's @entity254 will supply the panels for the aluminium @entity76 and the plastic @entity12 , while @entity258 is said to be assembling the higher - end phone and @entity260 will put together the cheaper model			1
the new @entity211 software will be available as a free upgrade in the @entity216 is the first software to be designed by @entity266 - born sir @entity265 following an alleged power struggle with previous design chief @entity268			0
@entity265 took over in october last year			0

industry analyst claims @entity1 is working on a cheaper version of its @entity12 handset that will be available in five colours
