a court heard @entity0 sold the red @entity10 - branded pills ( pictured ) on the streets of @entity6 , @entity24 but @entity59 which has the full name @entity59 is slower acting than @entity54 so some users are tempted to take higher doses			1

mr @entity43 said others in the house who had taken ecstasy before said the @entity10 tablets ' seemed different ' , describing their effect as being slow to start off with and then ' suddenly very strong '			2
@entity31 factory worker @entity17 ( pictured ) was found dead on christmas eve at his house he added : ' tragically the effect on @entity17 was that by @entity19 he was discovered dead in the flat and the cause of his death was found to be @entity59 toxicity			0

' our message is clear - the supply of dangerous drugs will not be tolerated and every effort will be taken to bring those responsible to justice			0
