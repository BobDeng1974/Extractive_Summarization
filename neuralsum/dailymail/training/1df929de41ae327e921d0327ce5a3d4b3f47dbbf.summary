by @entity0 @entity3 failed to report a quarter of all victims of aggravated assault and aggravated battery in their 2012 crime statistics , the city 's inspector general has discovered			1
the force was found to have breached state guidelines by only counting each attack as a single incident , when in fact they should have counted each victim			1
it means that all those attacks which resulted in multiple victims went under reported			1
@entity3 failed to report a quarter of all victims of aggravated assaults and aggravated batteries in their 2012 crime statistics , the city 's inspector general has found inspector general @entity22 looked at sample of 383 assault - related crimes , 72 of which resulted in a total of 95 victims , meaning that 23 victims , or 24 per cent , went unreported			2
the inspector general 's report read : ' @entity3 undercounted aggravated assaults and batteries on its @entity35 ( @entity34 ) submission by 24.2 per cent in a sample of incident reports examined by @entity38			0
' the undercount occurred because @entity3 based its crime count on the number of incident reports rather than the number of offenses against each victim , as required by the @entity45			2
' for example , if an incident resulted in three individual victims @entity3 would have counted this as one offense when , according to @entity34 , it should have counted it as three			2
' while there is no suggestion that the department made the errors intentionally , it is a further blow for the city , which in 2012 year claimed the unenviable title of @entity60 's murder capital			1
a spokesman for the @entity3 said aggravated assaults and aggravated batteries had been recorded in that way for years			0
in their response , which was published at the bottom of the @entity69 report , the department said it now intends to correct the figures , bringing them into line with @entity74 state guidelines			1
@entity75 was found to be the murder capital of @entity60 in 2012 , with more reported crimes than @entity78 , despite having only a third of the population the statement read : ' upon learning of the reporting issue , @entity3 immediately launched an in - depth review of every single aggravated assault and aggravated battery that occurred during 2012 and 2013 , to correct the tracking of these crimes and bring the city into stricter adherence with reporting standards			1
' this in - depth review is ongoing , and where errors in victim - level reporting exist , they will be corrected			0
' as soon as @entity3 was made aware of this issue , remedies were immediately put in place to ensure even greater precision in the future			0
' in 2012 there were 500 murders in @entity75 up from 431 in 2011 , according to @entity104 crime statistics , meaning the city overtook @entity78 for the first time , despite having a population only a third of the size			2
as a result of the increase , the inspector general also considered auditing the @entity3 's homicide statistics to evaluate the possibility that some homicides may have been downgraded			0
but of the 6,260 total homicides reported , 6,241 were found to be non-negligent murders , with only 19 listed as involuntary manslaughter or reckless homicide			0
the inspector general said they decided against an audit due to the small number of crimes categorized as involuntary manslaughter or reckless homicide in addition to a heightened public scrutiny of the number of reported murders .			0

@entity3 counted each attack as a single incident
but under @entity74 state guidelines they should have counted every victim
it means that attacks with multiple victims went under reported
@entity3 spokesman said they had been recording incidents this was ' for years '
@entity75 was @entity60 murder capital in 2012 *surpassing* @entity78 for first time
