@entity0 has just come back from @entity1			1
brits are having a bit of a moment over there on critically acclaimed shows like @entity7 , and @entity0 has the sort of leading man good looks and posh accent that should have them rolling out the red carpet for him			1
the only problem is , well ... it did n't go brilliantly			1
@entity0 says that living in @entity14 can make you feel like a failure ' i went to meet up with a few people but it 's put me off for another few years , ' says @entity0			1
' i do n't like the way that place makes me feel			2
when you go out to @entity14 , unless you 're a movie star , you feel like a failure and i do n't want to feel like a failure			2
if they call me , of course i 'd do it , but i 'm not going to go banging on doors			2
it 's too demeaning and humiliating			2
i do want to work on an @entity30 show ; the best of their tv is the best in the world at the moment			1
but i 'm not going to beg			2
' he did n't come away from @entity37 completely empty - handed - he won a small part in the second series of a pirate drama called @entity41 - but he seems a little underwhelmed by it			1
' i like to go into a series from the beginning and this is the second series , ' he shrugs			1
' i do n't know what 's going to happen to my character but it was fun to film ; i got to spend a few weeks in @entity50 with my friend @entity51 , who 's also in it			2
' normally at this time of year @entity0 , 43 , whose mother is to @entity55 's @entity54 and whose father @entity56 was an actor too , would be filming @entity57 ; but that was axed by @entity59 at the end of last year			1
he admits he 's still surprised and a little bit angry that the channel did n't let the gory detective drama have a fifth and final series			1
@entity0 and his wife @entity64 in january ' there was such a great storyline in the last series that it was a shame not to let us finish it off properly , ' he says			1
' even if it was just a two - parter to explain what series four was all about it would have been good			1
' when it began in 2009 , @entity57 attracted ratings of over 8 million but series four last year got just over 3 million , and @entity0 wonders whether it was simply because people did n't want to watch grisly goings - on while it was sunny outside			1
' @entity59 put the last series out at the end of the summer holidays ; if i was a viewer i would n't want to watch @entity57 then , ' he says			1
' so we did n't get off to a great start and with @entity59 it 's all about the viewing figures			2
' we meet not at @entity59 , but at the @entity88 's swish central @entity87 hq to discuss the new series of courtroom drama @entity90			1
it 's @entity0 's first day at work for a while - he 's been ' resting ' as they say in the business			1
not that it sounds that restful			2
he 's taken over childcare duties while his wife @entity98 appears in @entity99 play @entity100 , which means doing the school run for their children @entity104 , ten , and @entity56 , seven , every day			2
when i last spoke to him he told me he can be a little obsessive about tidiness , saying , ' i enjoy cleaning and tidying , @entity64 's more chaotic			2
i think anyone would have ocd if they lived with my wife			2
' today he admits he struggled to adapt to the way she ran the house			2
' to begin with it was a nightmare			0
it took me about two or three weeks to get into it and now i feel like the house is running correctly			0
what was wrong before ? well , we have completely different styles of running the house			0
i just did n't understand how she did it that way			0
let 's leave it at that			0
' on to @entity90 , the third series of which got off to an explosive start last week when @entity0 's character @entity131 finally made @entity132 and then declared his love for his rival @entity135 , played by @entity136			1
@entity0 plays @entity90 in @entity90 which got off to an explosive start last week when he declared his love for @entity90 , played by @entity136 ( right ) @entity131 's changed a bit over three series , and @entity0 says he approves			1
' he 's a bit more grown up and does n't want to go to bed with everything that moves			0
he spends the first half of the new series in love with @entity135 , then he starts to realise it 's not going to work and he has to get on with his life			1
he also gets more emotionally involved with some of his cases ; it 's something i asked for			0
i felt that if @entity131 never gets involved with them there 's not much drama in it			0
he 's a little bit less cut - throat but he still has that edge to him			0
' this year there are two new characters ; his old @entity164 friend @entity163 plays strong - willed office manager @entity165 , who 's determined to conflict with clerk @entity166 , and bright new trainee barrister @entity167 , played by @entity168			0
there 's also a real battle going on within the chambers ; between those who want it to become a prosecution - only practice and those who want it to retain its defence work			0
@entity0 was surprised and angry when @entity57 was axed by @entity59 last year the intelligent courtroom drama regularly attracts audiences of over 5 million but - perhaps bitten by his @entity57 experience - @entity0 says he worries this could be the last series			1
' i love the show - the cast members and the fabulous dialogue - but it feels a bit like the writer @entity188 has thrown a bomb in at the end			1
it could go on , but it feels like everyone is blasted in different directions and no one knows where each other is			1
we do n't know whether it 's been written this way because he wants to finish it off , or whether he thinks it can still continue			0
' ' if you stay in the same show for too long you might never get another one because people will only think of you in that role			0
it 's taken years for people to stop calling me @entity211 ' but @entity0 says that , regardless of the writer 's intentions , he is n't sure whether he 'd come back for a fourth series			1
' it would depend partly on what @entity56 says , but three years is a long time to stay in one role			0
if you stay in the same show for too long you might never get another one because people will only think of you in that role			0
it 's taken years for people to stop calling me @entity211 ( his @entity164 character , and the role that made his name ) and it can hold you back			0
' he sits back and mulls over the dilemma all actors face ; whether to take the job and risk being pigeonholed , or not take the job and struggle financially			0
' i 'm holding off for something different and new and good , ' he sighs			0
' when offers come in your insecurity comes through , especially when you have a family			0
you need to make sure you can pay the bills			0
but i 'd like to play something completely different			0
i 'd like to not have to wear a suit			0
' @entity90 , monday , 9pm , @entity239 .			0

@entity0 has *returned* from @entity30 feeling underwhelmed
he says he stills feels bitter about @entity57 getting the axe
he is still *undecided* whether or not to return for another series of silk
