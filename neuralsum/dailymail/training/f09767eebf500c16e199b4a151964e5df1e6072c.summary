@entity16 researchers believe that one reason , along with more mystifying ones , may be that island birds face less competition			1
birds develop different ' accents ' in their song depending on where they live , scientists said			2
a study of 723 male chaffinches in twelve different populations across the @entity13 mainland , the @entity7 and the @entity8 found their notes became more unpredictable the further they moved whereas a female may be attempting to pick out the right male among 60 other species singing all at once in @entity13 , in the @entity7 she faces just eight others			1
the males are the singers and biologist @entity32 , of @entity33 , @entity34 , said : ‘ one of the jobs the female has is to identify her own species			2
’ he compared the songs using a computer and discovered that the pattern of the notes , which he calls ' syllables ' , lost their syntax on the @entity45 archipelago which the birds have colonised over half a million years			1
the research found the chaffinches living in @entity49 in the @entity8 , still sing the same notes , but with a much less structured pattern from one bird to the next			1
dr @entity32 said : ‘ a chaffinch from mainland @entity13 always sounds like a chaffinch from mainland @entity13			2
' but on @entity49 , it is much harder for a human to pick them out by hearing alone			2
the study , published in the journal @entity60 , found the syntax was gradually lost step - by - step matching the known dispersal of the species			2
@entity16 researchers believe island chaffinches ( pictured right next to a greenfinch ) face less competition than their friends on the @entity13 mainland			1
whereas a female may be attempting to pick out the right male among 60 other species singing all at once in @entity13 , in the @entity7 she faces just eight others at the end of the island chain , it ‘ is not just changing , it is disappearing , ’ dr @entity32 said			1
‘ it is not about changing the rules , it is about losing them			0
’ there are almost twice as many species on the @entity8 as on the @entity7 , yet the @entity8 songs have much less structure , leading dr @entity32 to say that ' other factors must also be involved			1
’ a large body of research has shown birds learn their species - specific song from their elders			0
the research found the chaffinches living in @entity49 ( pictured ) in the @entity8 , still sing the same notes , but with a much less structured pattern from one bird to the next but if cultural transmission were the only source of syntax , one would expect songs from the smaller island populations to have more than those from the mainland , dr @entity32 said			1
yet there is also a genetic component to that learning			0
hundreds of genes have been identified which relate to song learning and singing			0
studies show young birds have a genetic predisposition helping them pick out which songs they ought to be learning in order to develop typical songs			0
dr @entity32 said : ‘ it appears very likely what we measured is the result of the evolution of such genes			0
’ he believes one of two plausible explanations may be something called a ‘ cultural trap ’			0
‘ in small populations , like those on islands shortly after colonisation , an evolutionary interaction between culture and genetic predisposition favours individuals that can recognise and learn a wider range of songs - in this case , a wider range of syntactical patterns , ’ he added			0
it may also be a case of ‘ withdrawal of learning ’			0
when populations are very small on the new island , young birds may find few tutors to learn from			2
some would be forced to improvise , and this would introduce new songs into the at a higher rate than normal , leading to rapid change in structure			0
now he has established this pattern of syntax loss across the islands , dr @entity32 hopes to use it to investigate the causes of song learning evolution .			0

@entity16 scientists studied 723 male chaffinches in twelve different populations across the @entity13 mainland , the @entity7 and the @entity8
they found the birds ' notes became more unpredictable the further they moved , perhaps because island birds face less competition
researchers at @entity33 found the chaffinches living in @entity49 still sing the same notes , but with a much less structured pattern
