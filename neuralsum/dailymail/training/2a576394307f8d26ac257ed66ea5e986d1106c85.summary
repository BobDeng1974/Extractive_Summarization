by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:28 est , 19 november 2012 updated : 18:44 est , 19 november 2012 police now have a picture of the man they believe killed three storekeepers in @entity7 , and are calling for the public ’s help in catching the mystery man they call ‘ @entity12 ’			1
the man in question is balding with a dark mustache and was seen walking near the scene of the most recent murder in @entity18			0
three store owners have been killed in their shops over the past four months and the killings are connected as all three were shot with the same .22 caliber handgun			1
ballistics tests matched in each killing , all of which occurred in @entity7 shops with an ' 8 ' in the address			0
@entity29 : the balding man with a mustache was seen twice in @entity18 minutes before and after the third shop keeper was killed on friday the latest suspect , ‘ @entity12 ’ , was caught on surveillance footage a block and a half away from the @entity18 store where @entity38 was killed on friday evening			1
minutes later , the same moustachioed - man is seen in a different video two blocks away from the store			0
murdered : @entity43 was killed with three gunshots , but it seems nothing was stolen the @entity47 reports that a different surveillance camera , located by the scene of the second murder in @entity51 also shows the same man			1
the video is of poorer quality , but they feel confident that the same duffle bag - toting man was in the area around the time that shopkeeper @entity58 was killed on august 2			0
‘ ” @entity12 ” wore a long overcoat and carried a duffel bag , ’ police commissioner @entity59 said			2
‘ he was seen in the vicinity of @entity38 ’s store just after 6 p.m. the shop owner ’s body was found at 7.11pm			2
’ this is not the first person - of - interest in the case , and a number have since been ruled out			0
previously unidentified suspects , dubbed ‘ @entity71 ’ and ‘ @entity72 ’ , were on the police ’s watch list since they were seen in the area of @entity38 ’s shop at the time of the murder			2
they have since been eliminated from the suspect pool as it turns out that ‘ @entity71 ’ stole a bottle of perfume from street vendor ‘ @entity72 ’ who was chasing after her following the theft			0
two remaining possibilities are ‘ @entity87 ’ , a woman who was seen near the crime scene wearing sunglasses and a scarf			2
looking for the man : he appeared near at least two of the three crime scenes over the past four months near the scene : none of the stores where the shootings took place had video cameras inside there also was a police sketch released following the first murder that took place earlier in the summer at a 99 cent store that left @entity106 dead on july 6			1
that possible suspect was a man with dark skin and wearing sunglasses , who witnesses described as being ‘ disturbed ’ and talking to himself about putting a bullet in someone ’s head			0
that man is said to be roughly 5 - foot - 5 and around 140 pounds			0
the @entity117 reports that the shop owner @entity118 was behind the counter of she she in @entity7 's @entity18 section when he was shot friday night			0
the gunman dragged the victim 's body toward the back of the store and covered it with clothing			0
victims : @entity58 and @entity106 were killed by the same handgun earlier this year police found the 78 - year - old with two gunshot wounds to the head and one to the torso , @entity130 reported			1
on the floor of the shop were the killer 's calling card : shell casings matching casings left at the scenes of the last two homicides			1
' now it 's like he 's telling us , ' it 's me again , '' a police source told the @entity117			2
casings that police have matched to two other murders			1
“ now it ’s like he ’s telling us , ‘ it ’s me again , ’ ” a police source said			2
the way @entity43 's body was hidden was also consistent with the previous shootings			0
on july 6 , @entity106 , 65 , was found shot through the neck in his @entity162 clothing shop			2
his body was also hidden			0
police believe the methodical killer does this to buy himself more getaway time by delaying the discovery of the bodies			1
' i hope they catch the son of a b * * * * , ' @entity106 's son , @entity170 said			0
when @entity177 did n't come home at the usual time friday his family called the police , who discovered his body			2
it was n't not clear if the killer actually took anything , or if the murder was his sole motivation			1
' he never had in his whole life one enemy , he did n't have , he was a very kind man , ' his sobbing wife , @entity187 , told reporters			0
suspect : following one homicide at a 99 cent store that used the same gun , police released this sketch of the suspect saturday he was supposed to be at his grandson ’s @entity198			2
police believe the murderer had been watching the store in preparation for the attack , noting that he 'd chosen a shop with no security cameras			1
@entity207 , 59 , was found dead in his @entity51 store at 1877 86th st. , was shot in the head and stabbed in the neck			0
besides owning stores , each victim was of @entity214 descent , prompting suspicion the killer could be racially motivated			1
it appeared nothing was taken from @entity43 's shop but both @entity219 and @entity106 had money taken from them , and it remains unclear whether robbery is a motive			0
unguarded : believe the killer was attracted to the store because , as with previous crime scenes , there were no cameras @entity228 of the @entity229 of the @entity230 said they were sending copies of the police sketch to their members but were mostly concerned with those fitting the previous victim 's description			1
' the only members that we would be concerned about are @entity214 , ' he said			1
it 's also possible the killer has a fascination with numerology , as the address for each homicide includes the number 8 : @entity219 at 1877 86th st. , @entity106 at 7718 5th ave. , and @entity43 at 834 @entity248 none of the stores had working surveillance cameras			1
scene : police believe the killer may have been casing the shop , as it had no security cameras to catch him in the act neighbors called @entity177 a ' neighborhood staple			1
' ' he was a regular guy , ' said customer @entity261			0
' he never hurt nobody			0
' police are offering $ 12,000 for any information leading to the killer 's arrest and conviction .			1

casings from the same .22 caliber handgun found at all three crime scenes
killer may have chosen stores based on lack of surveillance cameras
all three victims are @entity214 , prompting fears of racial motivation
police offering $ 12,000 *reward* for information
