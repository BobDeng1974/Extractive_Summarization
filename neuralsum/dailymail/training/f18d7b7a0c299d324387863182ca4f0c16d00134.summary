while @entity0 has been criticised for giving @entity1 a new position this season , the decision by @entity6 manager @entity5 to take @entity7 out of midfield and put him into a three - man defence seems to have been the making of the £ 10million @entity11 under 21 international			1
from being ridiculed as a plodding central midfield player with the turning capabilities of the @entity14 , can is now being compared to @entity15 and all the other great @entity6 defenders who were comfortable on the ball and used as a springboard for attacks			1
he 's gone from @entity20 to @entity21 , which is how @entity5 described the 21 - year - old after snuffing out @entity23 in the @entity25 derby a couple of weeks ago			1
@entity7 ( here holding off @entity28 's @entity27 ) has found a new lease of life in a back three at @entity6 can was described as performing like a ' @entity21 ' against @entity23 by manager @entity5 can was also man - of - the - match when @entity6 beat @entity28 3 - 2 on tuesday night ahead of saturday 's @entity33 fifth - round tie against @entity35 , when @entity5 faces a big decision whether to leave can at the back or restore him in the middle to cover for the injured @entity39			1
@entity6 have lost only once in 11 games in 2015 and @entity5 will be reluctant to change things around too much			1
after the recent goalless draw at @entity23 in which can stopped @entity42 , the manager said : ' he was like a @entity21			2
he 's only 21 and defended fantastically			2
' once derided , can is now regarded as a force of nature by fans on @entity48 and whatever the manager chooses to do it is a different can to the one who struggled immediately following his summer move from @entity53			1
tall and powerfully - built , can was injured just 20 minutes into his pre-season debut at @entity56 , hobbling off with a calf problem			2
no sooner had he recovered from that , he injured his ankle on international duty			0
@entity5 must take credit for recognising @entity64 's aptitude for playing in a three - man defence in between the knocks , he appeared to struggle with the pace of the @entity69 game			1
last season 's @entity71 runners - up started the season badly and can , signed from @entity53 , was lumped together with @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 and other overpriced summer buys			1
a great strike against @entity79 at @entity80 in november was the first real glimpse of his potential but it was only when he dropped further back that things really began to take off			0
@entity74 was axed and can slotted in alongside @entity85 and @entity86 where his calmness on the ball and reading of the game have helped @entity6 stop leaking goals			2
he was the victim of @entity94 's stamp in the @entity96 semi-final – a sure sign he was getting under the @entity79 striker 's skin			0
can was the victim of this horrific stamp by @entity79 's @entity94 in the @entity96 semi-final @entity103 was moved further forward from left back and flourished at @entity28 managers regard it as a badge of honour when they spot a player could do well in a new position			0
@entity110 was praised for pushing left back @entity103 further forward at @entity28 and the winger became the world 's most expensive player when he moved to @entity114			0
a less spectacular example , but one remembered fondly by @entity6 fans , is @entity117 converting @entity118 from striker to right - sided midfield player where his phenomenal work - rate gave the team balance , while still chipping with the odd goal			1
it will be interesting to see where @entity7 's career develops from here			2
@entity39 's departure in the summer means there will be a vacancy for a holding midfielder who can pass the ball			0
but if it 's deemed @entity64 lacks the necessary speed to do that job , he now has another string to his bow			0
@entity103 went 24 @entity71 games without a win at left - back but ended ' the curse of @entity103 ' after he converted into a winger , scoring a hat - trick against @entity144 and sealing an £ 86million move from @entity28 to @entity114			1
@entity118 signed by @entity117 at @entity6 as a striker but when it became clear he would n't score enough goals in @entity69 football , he played wide - right and ended up becoming a cult figure in his six seasons at @entity80			1
@entity152 @entity153 was a striker when he first won the league championship with @entity155 but it became clear over time his passing ability coupled with a lack of blistering pace would make him more suited to midfield			0
@entity160 switched him and he had more than a decade 's success there with @entity155 , @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 and @entity167			0
@entity168 a flying winger who relied on his pace throughout his teens and twenties , @entity168 re-invented himself as a clever central midfielder in his later years at @entity174 , enabling him to play on until he was 40			0
@entity175 like his former @entity164 and @entity167 team - mate @entity176 , has virtually played in every outfield position in his career			0
@entity179 started as a full back , made his name for @entity167 as a wide player because of his crossing ability but spent the most successful period of his career as a holding midfielder for @entity186 and now @entity23 .			0

@entity7 took time to *settle* into the @entity71 after a summer move
but the 21 - year - old has found himself a steady home at centre back
can we described as a ' @entity21 ' by @entity5
