by @entity0 published : 03:13 est , 10 december 2013 updated : 03:25 est , 10 december 2013 distraught : @entity2 , 40 , burned his estranged wife 's £ 68,000 estate , the @entity6 heard a widower who set fire to his estranged wife 's £ 68,000 estate after she died of cancer is being sued by her new lover for a share of the cash			1
@entity14 , 40 , could be left homeless after he ' literally burned ' the cash in a fit of grief , in a case which has been compared to @entity20 ' tragic courtroom drama @entity18			1
mr @entity14 's wife @entity21 was 38 when she died of cancer without leaving a will			1
that meant mr @entity14 , from @entity25 , @entity26 , automatically inherited everything she owned despite her leaving him several years earlier for a new partner			1
when she died her ' articulate and intelligent ' husband was so upset that he drew out tens of thousands of pounds in cash and torched it all , a court heard			1
the assets included her half share of a £ 130,000 life insurance policy and the equity in the home the couple once shared			0
her new partner , @entity40 , claimed he and mrs @entity42 's two children were entitled to a share of the estate and sued him last year at @entity46 , which ruled all three were entitled to ' reasonable provision '			1
mr @entity14 appeared to fight that ruling yesterday at @entity49 's @entity6 , where details of the case were aired for the first time			2
@entity53 , for mr @entity40 and the children , said : ' it has been admitted frankly that the money has been burnt			1
this is conduct that one should bear in mind when considering whether to grant mr @entity14 the indulgence which he seeks			0
' mr @entity53 accepted bank records tallied with mr @entity14 's story but added : ' my clients have some difficulty accepting that the money has gone			0
' mr @entity14 says the money has been burnt			0
if the money has been burnt , it does n’t stop a judgment being entered against other assets held by mr @entity14			0
' lord @entity72 gave mr @entity14 permission to appeal - on condition that he signs a sworn statement within ten days ' giving details of exactly how , where and when the money was literally burnt			0
' the judge added : ' this is a relatively modest estate			2
all this has turned this family tragedy into a modern day version of @entity84 and @entity84			2
' mr @entity14 has suffered significant bereavements in the last year or so ; not only his wife had died but [ other family members ] have been lost			2
' there is some evidence he has been suffering from a significant depressive illness [ although ] he is clearly an articulate and intelligent man			0
' the judge 's allusion to ' @entity84 ' was a reference to @entity18 , @entity20 ' masterpiece story of a family at war			1
the case was compared to warring family members in @entity20 ' @entity18 ( pictured in a @entity100 version ) bleak : mr @entity14 told @entity49 's @entity6 , pictured , that he could lose his home if he has to repay the cash the fictional family battled so bitterly over a relative 's will that by the time a judge decided who should win the money , it had been completely swallowed in lawyers ' fees			1
the court heard @entity14 and mrs @entity42 wed in july 2003 and had a daughter , @entity113 , now eight , before mrs @entity42 left their home in @entity116 to form a new relationship			2
she moved in with her new partner mr @entity40 and had her son @entity119 , now four			1
describing the case as ' somewhat unusual ' , mr @entity14 ’s counsel , @entity120 , told the judge that the widower could lose his home if he has to pay back the burnt cash			2
when asked if he had burnt the money because he was upset at his wife ’s death , mr @entity14 said outside court : ' yes , i was more than upset , but i do n’t want to say any more about it at the moment			0
i ’ll put it all down in the affidavit for the judge			0
' if mr @entity14 does not file the affidavit within the 10 - day deadline , his appeal will automatically be dismissed			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0

@entity42 , from @entity26 , died of cancer at 38 without making a will
@entity145 was the sole next of kin because they were still married
he set fire to the whole of her estate in cash ' because he was so upset '
but her partner @entity40 said he and her two children were *rightful* heirs
*bizarre* case has been compared to @entity20 ' family drama @entity18
