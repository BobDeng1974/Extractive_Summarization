by @entity0 amazingly well - preserved cave paintings dating back seven millenia have been discovered in @entity3			1
the stunning murals provide a rare glimpse into daily prehistoric life - showing dramatic hunting scenes including human archers			1
despite being exposed to harsh weather , the ' totally unique ' artwork has survived on a 19ft ( 6 metre ) long wall inside a small cave in @entity13 in @entity14 , in the east of the country			1
cave paintings dating from 7,000 years ago have been discovered in @entity3 , which show hunting scenes including human archers and primitive bulls ( pictured ) called aurochs the exact location of the cave is being kept a secret until the paintings can be properly protected and preserved , @entity22 reported			1
archaeologists discovered the ancient paintings , which include drawings of two aurochs - ancestors of modern cattle - two human archers and a goat			1
a layer of dust protected 12 figures , which were exposed to the weather , but luckily the pigmentation of the paintings has not suffered as a result			1
computer analysis has made it possible to identify aspects of the paintings that had not been easily visible behind the dust			1

experts think that the figures ( pictured ) evoke hunting scenes and moments prior to the chase a layer of dust protected 10 figures , which were exposed to the weather , but thankfully the pigmentation of the paintings has not suffered as a result			1
this image shows one of the archers beneath the dust the newly discovered paintings in the cave appear to show a human using a bow and arrow			1
the primitive weapon is known to have been invented by the end of the @entity75			0
@entity76 eventually replaced spear - throwers as the predominant way of catching food			0
the oldest evidence of archery in @entity82 was found in a valley in @entity84 , @entity85 and is up to 13,000 years old			0
arrows were made of pine and had flint points			0
the oldest definite bows were found in @entity90 in @entity91 in the 1940s and have been dated to 8,000 bc. experts believe the figures evoke hunting scenes and the moments prior to the chase			2
researchers from the @entity99 , the @entity100 and the @entity101 came across the site while they were examining another area in the region			0
@entity105 , a research professor at the @entity99 said : ‘ some of the [ painting ] details are unique [ and unlike anything ] across the entire @entity109 ’			2
' hunting scenes are common in @entity112 rock art.			0
. they are mostly focused on deer , goat or wild board hunting , but bull hunting is far less common , ' she told @entity119			2
' when depicted , they usually [ show ] linear archers - very schematic figures - later in the sequence			2
however , in this new site , the archer they are related with is also naturalistic			0
' dr @entity127 explained that @entity112 rock art - the group of over 700 sites of prehistoric rock art of the @entity132 - was included in the @entity133 by @entity134 in 1998 , so the historic , cultural and artistic value of this rock art tradition has already a universal recognition			0
' isolated bulls are more common in @entity112 art , while in this scene we have at least 4 bulls sharing the scene , ' she said			0
' there are other examples , such as the @entity148 or @entity149 in @entity150 , but considering that there are more than 700 sites with @entity112 art known so far , this scene can be considered unique			0
' dr @entity154 explained that the action and some of the features of the archer has not been seen before , as well as one of the animals painted , but that the findings will be revealed in a forthcoming research paper			2
the condition of the paintings is also excellent			2
' although new discoveries have taken place in the last few years , they usually include a very few and damaged motifs			2
but in this site we have a minimum of 12 quite well preserved motifs , including several animal species and most of them are quite large - the average size of the bulls is 30cm , and the humans 16 cm. ' the uncovered site means that links could be established between the paintings in the area of @entity182 in @entity14 with those situated in @entity184 , as @entity13 lies between them			1
' this finding fills a gap and help us to start reconstructing potential communication routes between these two main rock art regions			0
these links are also supported by the stylistic similarities of some of the motifs at these new site with other motifs recorded in these two major regions , ' she said			0
the @entity182 caves are filled with images of archers and large animals , such as an enormous primitive bull , and are considered to be some of the most important examples of open air cave paintings in the world			1
some caves show examples of agriculture and hunting scenes , such as a single male attacking a group of deer with a bow and arrow , hinting at a technique used by the primitive inhabitants of the caves			0

here , it is possible to see the painting of the auroch beneath the dust			0

cave paintings were discovered in @entity13 in @entity14 , @entity3
they include drawings of two aurochs , two human archers and a goat
