he was one of the most beloved teachers in the world of international schools that serve the children of diplomats , well - off @entity46 and local elites			0
the discovery of his molestation has set off a crisis in the community of international schools , where parents are being told their children may have been victims , and administrators are scurrying to close loopholes exposed by @entity12 's abuses			1

in addition to teaching , he coached basketball and led school trips to @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126			0
authorities may have missed a warning sign during a later teaching stint in @entity130 : two students under @entity12 's care were rushed to a hospital after falling unconscious in their hotel room on a trip , parents and staff said			2
officials were unable to determine why and chalked it up to a possible failing air conditioner			0
seven years later , the @entity141 went to work at the @entity143 campus of @entity87 's @entity86 , with about 350 pupils from 70 countries			0
police say at least 60 of the 90 or so children in the images on the usb drive were from that school			0

in early march , the maid who had taken the memory drive handed it to @entity46 @entity20 school director @entity175 , who found it contained photos of unconscious boys , many between the ages of 12 and 14 , often being touched by @entity12			1
@entity175 confronted @entity12 , who told her , according to an @entity9 affidavit , that he had given the boys sleeping pills , adding : ' i was molested as a boy , that is why i do this			1
i have been doing this my whole life			0
