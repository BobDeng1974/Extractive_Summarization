@entity4 , who announced his bid for the @entity20 on tuesday , admitted that he needs to ' have more patience ' with reporters , even if he 's ' annoyed ' with them while maintaining that ' interviews should be questions and not editorializing			1
' the confession summed up the freshman lawmaker 's second day as an official 2016 contestant - a bumpy ride that has so far included a confrontation with the chairwoman of the @entity32 over late - term abortion and @entity4 's declaration that she seems to be ' ok with killing a 7 - pound baby			1
' @entity5 presidential candidate @entity4 is on the defensive after an acrimonious exchange with today host @entity18 on wednesday morning			1
' no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no ! ' listen , you 've editorialized , ' he blasted at @entity18 @entity4 , a libertarian - leaning @entity11 senator , launched his presidential bid on tuesday in @entity40			1
responding yesterday to accusations of sexism that bubbled up following his dust up with @entity18 , @entity4 said , ' i think i have been universally short - tempered and testy with both male and female reporters			1
i 'll own up to that ' @entity4 's woes on wednesday began with an early morning sparring match on today with @entity18 over perceived flip flops on foreign policy issues			1
a disgruntled @entity4 cut her off and said , ' why do n't we let me explain instead of talking over me , ok ? ' ' before we go through a litany of things you say i 've changed on , why do n't you ask me a question : " have i changed my opinion ? " that would be sort of a better way to approach an interview			1
' @entity18 proceeding as requested , asking him if he had shifted his views on any foreign policies , but he still was n't satisfied , telling her , ' no , no , you 've editorialized			1
' ' no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no ! ' listen , you 've editorialized			0
let me answer a question ! you ask a question , and you say , " have your views changed ? " instead of editorializing and saying my views have changed , ' he continued			0
@entity4 responded with a similarly peevish attitude to a line of questioning he considered ' slanted ' in a february back and forth with @entity75 anchor @entity74 , whom he shushed and told to ' calm down a bit ' before giving her advice on how to do her job			1
@entity79 , a liberal opposition - research group , tore into @entity4 on wednesday morning , telling @entity80 , ' @entity4 ca n't seem to step in front of a camera without proving that shooting from the hip is a good way to shoot yourself in the foot			1
' ' he 's got miles to go before his ability catches up to his ambition , ' the group 's spokesman , @entity86 , said			0
'' and judging by his temper , he knows it , too			0
' a spokeswoman for the @entity93 accused @entity4 of running away from his record			2
' every time he gets asked about something he ’s said , his response is to deny ever having said it , ' @entity93 national press secretary @entity97 said , adding that it will be difficult for @entity4 to run as the ' " trust " candidate when he keeps blatantly lying to voters about his own record			1
' ' and senator … do n’t bother shushing us			0
we have the video to prove it , ' she said			0
by wednesday afternoon @entity4 was being labeled as a sexist , leading the conservative to declare on @entity14 that he 's an ' equal opportunity ' offender			1
' i was annoyed with a male reporter this morning , ' he said			2
' i will have to get better at holding my tongue and holding my temper			0
' the male reporter in question may have been the @entity116 ' @entity115 , whom @entity4 had derided earlier that day at a @entity118 campaign stop for aggressively pressing him to nail down his views on abortion			1
' i gave you about a five - minute answer			0
put in my five - minute answer , ' he reportedly told @entity115 , growing tired of the discussion			2
according to @entity115 , @entity4 had previously contended that , ' the thing is about abortion — and about a lot of things — is that i think people get tied up in all these details of , sort of , you 're this or this or that , or you 're hard and fast ( on ) one thing or the other			2
' ' i think the most important thing is the general concept of : do you support the sanctity of life ? do you think there 's something special about life ? so you think when we 're born that a human baby is different than an animal , that there 's something special that is imbued into human life ? and i think there is			2
' @entity4 acknowledged that he 'd supported bills that granted exceptions in cases of rape and incest and bills that did not			2
' in general , i am pro-life			0
so i will support legislation that advances and shows that life is special and deserves protection , ' he explained			0
the freshman senator also had confrontation with @entity93 chair @entity162 on wednesday			2
' why do n't we ask the @entity93 : is it ok to kill a 7 - pound baby in the uterus ? ' had said			1
@entity162 responded by attacking his position on personal liberty - and by asking him not to shush her @entity4 was joined by his wife @entity172 on stage tuesday as he declared that he would campaign to ' take our country back ' after the @entity93 blasted the @entity116 ' write - up of the conversation , other reporters following @entity4 around in @entity118 began asking him about abortion , at which point the freshman senator turned the argument on the campaign arm of the @entity32			1
' why do n't we ask the @entity93 : is it ok to kill a 7 - pound baby in the uterus ? ' he shot back			1
' you go back and go ask @entity162 if she 's ok with killing a 7 - pound baby that 's just not born yet , ' @entity4 said , referencing the @entity93 's chairwoman			1
' ask her when life begins , and ask @entity162 when she 's willing to protect life			0
when you get an answer from @entity162 , come back to me			0
' reporters did n't have to wait very long for a response			2
shortly after @entity4 laid down the gauntlet , the @entity93 issued a statement on behalf of @entity162 that said : ' here ’s an answer			2
i support letting women and their doctors make this decision without government getting involved			0
' ' now your turn , senator @entity4 , ' she said			2
' we know you want to allow government officials like yourself to make this decision for women — but do you stand by your opposition to any exceptions , even when it comes to rape , incest , or life of the mother ? ' or do we just have different definitions of " personal liberty " ? ' getting in one last dig , @entity222 ended her statement with the remark , ' and i ’d appreciate it if you could respond without @entity227 ’ me			0
' appearing on @entity14 , @entity4 said , ' it sounds like her answer is yes , that she ’s ok with killing a 7 - pound baby			1
' ' @entity162 ’s position , which i guess is the @entity32 ’s position , that an abortion all the way up until the day of birth would be fine , i really think most pro-choice people would be uncomfortable with that , ' he asserted			1
thursday morning brought better news for @entity4 , as a @entity239 was released that showed him beating possible @entity32 competitor @entity241 in a general election match up in two swing states that president @entity244 won by several points in 2012			1
@entity4 has consistently performed well against @entity246 in surveys , but he now leads her in @entity249 and @entity250 by one and three points , respectively			2
hurting @entity246 is the perception among voters that she is ' not honest and trustworthy , ' @entity252 , assistant director of the @entity239 , explained in a statement accompanying the release of the survey			0
reviewing survey data , @entity252 said , ' it is difficult to see secretary @entity246 's slippage as anything other than a further toll on her image from the furor over her e-mail			0
' that @entity4 and other probable @entity5 contenders have gained so much ground on her since it became public knowledge that she exclusively used her private email address during her tenure at the @entity276 , @entity252 said is ' ominous			0
' ' i 'm going to keep an open mind and look at the agreement , ' @entity4 said , while allowing that ' i do believe that negotiation is better than war			0
' he mirrored other republicans in questioning the ' sincerity of the @entity284 ' in reaching an agreement with the @entity286 and five @entity288 nations			0
' if they 're immediately saying that the agreement does n't mean what president @entity244 says , that is a big problem , ' @entity4 said			2
' the @entity284 put out 500 words , the @entity286 put out 1,300 words , the @entity288 put out 200 words			0
and they do n't all seem to agree , but it 's very , very little information so far			0
' he defended his position on foreign aid , saying that even @entity301 prime minister @entity300 has agreed that his country should one day shake off its dependence on @entity286 to fund its defense program			0
' i still agree with my original precept , which is – lem me answer the question ! – i still agree with my original statement from years ago that ultimately all nations should be free of foreign aid , ' he said , ' because we should n't borrow money to do it			0
' ' but my opinion 's not any different than @entity300 's opinion			0
' the @entity4 campaign did not respond to a request for comment no whether or not @entity18 gave him a fair interview .			1

' why do n't we let me explain instead of talking over me , ok ? ' he asked today 's @entity18 as she tried to corner him wednesday morning
