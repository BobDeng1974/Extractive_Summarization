@entity1 winger @entity0 has warned his team - mates they will find themselves on the wrong end of another cup shock if they repeat saturday 's dismal display against @entity6			1
the former @entity7 forward rescued a point for the sloppy @entity10 side with just six minutes left at the @entity11 as he cancelled out @entity15 's first - half @entity14 opener			1
the 1 - 1 draw now leaves the @entity18 side trailing @entity20 rivals hearts by three points in the race for promotion			1
@entity1 ' @entity0 celebrates his goal but admits his side have to improve in midweek but @entity0 is worried @entity26 will not give them a similar reprieve when the @entity29 take on the @entity30 in tuesday night 's @entity32 third - round clash			1
@entity33 has already suffered a number of cup upsets during his four - year spell as boss - including a major upset at the @entity26 stadium three years ago before their liquidation crisis			1
and @entity0 has warned they will find themselves on the end of another disaster if they do not improve on their weekend showing			2
' we definitely wo n't get away with this kind of performance against @entity26 , ' said the 25 - year - old			1
' we did not play to the standard we showed against @entity52 and @entity53 last week and it cost us			0
' the plastic pitch at @entity6 did n't help			2
it was one of the older surfaces and was really sticky			0
' @entity26 's pitch is one of the newer astros and come tuesday i 'm sure we will play a lot better			1
' @entity1 had fallen behind to @entity15 's goal and needed @entity0 's late goal to rescue a point @entity0 started saturday 's match on the bench but made an early entrance after @entity68 limped off with a foot injury			1
@entity70 was also replaced just before the break after damaging his right shoulder , while @entity73 missed the game completely with a calf strain			0
all three are doubts for tuesday 's match but @entity0 believes there are others in the @entity10 squad ready to step up			1
he said : ' it 's disappointing for @entity68 to pick up an injury as he has been brilliant for us this season			2
hopefully he will be okay - i do n't think it was anything too bad			0
' we also lost @entity70 and had @entity73 out as well			0
@entity73 and @entity68 are massive for us down that left - hand side while @entity70 has been doing really well for us too			2
' it looked like @entity70 picked up a bad one though			0
it 's never nice to see guys picking up injuries but it gives others like myself a chance to come on and get a chance			2
@entity33 's side could be witout @entity70 after he picked up a seemingly bad injury during the game ' it was good for me that i was able to get on			1
the first half i did n't do too well but i had a better second half and then got the goal , which was nice			0
' @entity0 levelled the match following @entity107 's clever header 10 minutes before the interval when he tapped home from close range after @entity112 's fierce shot was spilled by home keeper @entity113			2
but @entity114 was denied a stoppage - time winner by an offside flag			0
' it was good to get the equaliser but i thought we could have snatched it late on , ' said the winger			0
' we had a couple of chances and i 'm not sure how close big @entity114 's offside goal was			0
' but really , based on how poor we were in the first half , i do n't think we did enough to win it			0

@entity0 *scored* equaliser as @entity1 draw with @entity6
@entity33 's side face @entity26 in @entity32 tie on tuesday
@entity1 three points behind @entity7 in @entity20 after poor performance
