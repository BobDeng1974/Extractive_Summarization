another year , another @entity0			0
but where only hints of next - gen gaming blessed last year 's meeting , this year , the @entity1 and @entity2 took centre stage			1
and generally , both fared very well			0
earlier in the year , @entity9 reported that @entity1 exclusive @entity10 looked extremely rough around the edges - even being eclipsed in the visual department by current - gen racer , @entity14 6			1
out of first gear : at this year 's @entity0 , @entity10 looked far more impressive than the @entity17 demo but what a difference a few months make			1
@entity19 is noticeably sharper , and car models have been given a much - needed spit and polish			2
environments are no longer plagued with pop - up , and there 's now a subtle motion blur , giving the racer a next - gen sheen			2
still , @entity30 's @entity2 exclusive , @entity31 5 , raced ahead of the pack with regards to graphics			1
pixel - perfect cars and dynamic lighting make this one of the best - looking racers yet			0
critics may have noticed some of the environments looking slightly bland , but the demo is far from representative of the final game			0
stunning : @entity44 boasted the best visuals of any racer at the event , closely followed by @entity48 @entity48 added a much - needed dash of arcade racing to the mix , while @entity53 's intriguing multiplayer mechanism is sure to win over fans			1
here , players have to work together in a pack of modified super cars to complete objectives - such as ramming a target vehicle off the road			0
up close , @entity53 's visuals still look slightly raw , but it 's hugely impressive in motion - with @entity64 - style slow - motion takedowns and intricately - detailed car models			1
dark knight rises : origins explores a much younger @entity68 and his animation and fighting style reflects that away from the racing scene , and @entity68 : @entity72 was unveiled in all of its glory			1
it 's extremely similar to the last two games - which may leave some fans wanting more			2
what is noticeable , however , is @entity68 's movement			1
he 's younger in @entity72 and so is more agile and graceful than the blunt , heavy - handed hero we 've played in the last two games			1
being a current - gen game in a sea of next - gen offerings is always hard , but origins still looked impressive			1
the sense of scale and the realisation of a snow - covered @entity89 create the most visually - striking backdrop yet			0
@entity91 smooth : @entity92 was a masterclass in gaming , boasting a consistent framerate and great visuals although queues stretched long and far for @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101 , it was @entity102 : @entity92 that really stood out for us			1
running on middle - powered pcs , the visuals still looked breathtaking			2
shooting mechanics were incredibly responsive , as were death animations , while a clever lean function emphasises the need to rely on cover ( to let health regenerate ) and not just running in			0
lighting up next year : dying light is looking like a much more dynamic version of @entity114			1
the free - running component is inspired , too			0
it 's set for release next year dying @entity118 , too , a mix of @entity120 and @entity114 was incredibly impressive , too			2
you play a survivor who must scavenge for weapons and food and must use free - running to escape hordes of zombies			0
during the day , they are slow and clumsy , but at night they change into frenzied , merciless animals			0
boasting dynamic lighting , photo - realistic textures and next - gen motion blur and draw distance , it looks to be the most impressive , open - world zombie game ever created			2
on this evidence , the future 's bright for gamers			0
follow us on @entity140 : @ @entity141 and on @entity142 : @entity9 .			0

dying light and @entity102 : the @entity92 shine in sea of first - person *adventures*
@entity1 exclusive @entity10 's visuals look much better than those seen at @entity17
@entity2 's @entity44 looks on course to steal racing crown
@entity68 : @entity72 looked impressive - *albeit* more of the same
