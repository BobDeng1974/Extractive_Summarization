the @entity5 peer said there was almost certainly going to be a ' stalemate hung @entity3 '			1
@entity0 also stopped well short of offering his enthusiastic endorsement of @entity12 and once again attacked @entity5 's proposed ' mansion tax ' on expensive homes			1
he said the tax on properties worth over £ 2million would not ' in a month of sundays ' raise the £ 1.2 billion a year predicted by the @entity5 leader			1
asked if the party would be doing better under another leader , the peer said : ' do you think your product would be better if you changed the wrapping ? it depends what you think people are voting for			0
' the @entity27 seized on the former business secretary 's comments as proof that @entity5 is relying on support from the @entity32 to propel mr @entity12 into 10 @entity33			1
looking ahead to the election during a speech at the @entity37 conference in @entity38 , @entity0 said : ' people basically are unhappy with what is on offer			1

' answering questions after the speech , @entity0 was asked if @entity5 would be doing better in the polls ' if it had a leader the public liked better '			1
after a long pause , the @entity53 replied : ' do you think your product would be better if you changed the wrapping ? ' it depends what you think people are voting for			0
people are voting for more than simply the personification of a party			0
' of course that is important , but they are voting for the party 's values and the party 's relevance , the quality of that product and whether they think that product - or in our case as politicians , that policy - will do for them			2
' of course , the leader has a responsibility for being the chief brand carrier of that product or policy			0
' i think you will see that , as the real election campaign gets under way , the leader of the @entity5 will have the opportunities as well as the pressure to explain , get his message across and to draw others more towards him and the party in order to shape their voting decision			2
' @entity0 stopped well short of offering his enthusiastic endorsement of @entity12 in a question and answer session today speaking later at a @entity98 conference in @entity99 , @entity0 said he had been trying to make the point that people should not become ' infatuated with personality - driven media - obsessed politics ' which focus entirely on the identity of the leader			2
discussing the mansion tax , he said : ' not in a month of sundays will it raise the amount of money that is projected			1
everyone knows that it wo n't			0
' @entity113 chairman @entity112 said : ' @entity0 is confirming what we now all know - the only way @entity12 will get into @entity33 is if he 's carried there in @entity119 's pocket			1
' that would mean more borrowing , higher taxes and weaker defences			0
hard - working taxpayers would pay the price for the resulting economic chaos and a weak leader who simply is n't up to the job of being prime minister			0
