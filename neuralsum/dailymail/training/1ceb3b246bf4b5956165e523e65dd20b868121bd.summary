the @entity0 claims common childhood illnesses such as tonsillitis and ear infections can cause hearing loss later in life common childhood illnesses such as tonsillitis and ear infections can cause hearing loss later in life , according to results from a famous study			1
the @entity0 monitored 1,142 @entity0 - born babies from 1947 to the present day , measuring their health , growth and development			1
a quarter of the participants , who are now in their 60s , have had their hearing tested and the results show those who had infections as children were more likely to have hearing loss			1
dr @entity19 , who led the study at the @entity21 at @entity22 , said : ' our findings show that those who suffered from infections as a child were more likely to have a hearing loss in their 60s			1
' reducing childhood infection rates may help prevent hearing loss later in life			2
' this study shows the importance of the @entity0 birth cohorts , with the study initially focusing on childhood infections			2
' the study is nearly 70 years old and continues to make a major contribution to understanding health conditions , which is only possible through the continued contribution of cohort members			0
' tonsillitis , ear infections and multiple episodes of bronchitis occurring in the first year of life were linked to the condition			2
dr @entity48 , @entity49 at @entity50 , said : ' hearing loss affects as many as one in six people across the @entity54 and is often seen as just another sign of getting old			0
' however , the study shows that this is not necessarily the case ; illnesses in childhood could have long - lasting consequences for hearing in later life			0
the renowned study began in 1947 , meaning many of the participants are now in their 60s ( picture posed by model ) ' hearing loss can have a big impact on a person 's life , isolating them from family and friends , and has been linked to other health conditions like depression and dementia			1
' these findings remind us that it 's never too early to think about protecting your hearing			0
' planning for the study began in the 1930s when @entity0 had a high infant mortality rate compared with the rest of the @entity54			0
the start of the study was delayed by the @entity89 , but got under way in may 1947 when recruitment began for a one - year study of health in infancy .			0

famous @entity0 - based study monitored babies from 1947 to present day
participants now in their 60s had hearing tested revealing clear connection
