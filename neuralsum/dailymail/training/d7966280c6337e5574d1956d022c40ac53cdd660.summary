@entity0 last night warned that the horrific chemical weapons attack in @entity2 was ‘ not something that a humane and civilised world can ignore ’			2
the foreign secretary refused to rule out any response to wednesday ’s atrocity in @entity8			1
and he laid the blame for the attack – which is reported to have killed up to 1,700 people – squarely at the door of tyrant @entity13			1
@entity0 said the atrocity in @entity8 was ' not something that a humane and civilised world can ignore ' a mother and father weep over their child 's body who was killed in a suspected chemical weapons attack on the @entity8 suburb of @entity25 mr @entity0 said the possibility that rebel fighters could have unleashed the chemicals , as claimed by the @entity13 regime and its @entity31 allies , was ‘ vanishingly small ’			1
he said : ‘ i know some people in the world would like to say this is some kind of conspiracy brought about by the opposition in @entity2 – i think the chances of that are vanishingly small			1
so we do believe this is a chemical attack by the @entity13 regime on a large scale			1
’ mr @entity0 , who discussed the crisis with @entity45 secretary of state @entity44 and @entity47 secretary general @entity46 , called for @entity47 chemical weapons inspectors to be allowed immediate access to the site of the attack before any evidence deteriorates			1
mr @entity46 added that inspectors , who are based a 20 - minute drive away , should be allowed in ‘ without delay ’			2
defence secretary @entity56 suggested the atrocity could harden @entity59 ’s response to the civil war in @entity2 , saying : ‘ if , as the evidence suggests , chemical weapons have been used on a significant scale against a civilian population , those who are responsible should be in no doubt they will be held to account by the international community			2
’ dead animals litter the street in the region where forces loyal to @entity73 allegedly used chemical weapons a man holds the body of a dead child among bodies of people activists say were killed by nerve gas in the @entity25 region , in the @entity84 neighbourhood of @entity8 , many of them were women and children it comes as @entity45 media report that the @entity45 military is preparing for a long - range missile attack on @entity2 government targets			1
escalation towards a military strike could mean that president @entity94 intends to make good on his threat of ' enormous consequences ' if @entity13 crossed the ' red line ' of using chemical weapons against his own people			1
possible targets include command bunkers and missile sites that could be used to launch chemical - tipped missiles			0
chairman of the @entity106 @entity105 is expect to present the plan for a missile strike to @entity94 at a national security meeting on saturday			0
@entity110 reports that ' the @entity111 is making initial preparations for a missile attack on @entity2 government forces			2
' commanders of the @entity116 in the @entity117 ordered warships to move closer to @entity119 , so they would be in better striking range to hit forces in @entity2			0
there are four main options facing @entity124 and his allies , none of which offer an easy way out the maximum range for @entity131 is about 1,500 miles			0
however any missile strike is likely to be more tactical than strategic - they are unlikely to topple , or even significantly destabilize @entity13 's regime and so @entity45 leaders will be hoping that instead it sends a strong message to the regime that chemical weapons will not be tolerated			2
@entity139 is expected to carry out a round of telephone diplomacy from his @entity143 holiday retreat over the weekend and convene the @entity144 next week to discuss @entity59 ’s options for a response			0
in recent weeks the prime minister has backed away from the idea of arming @entity2 ’s rebels because of concerns within his own party that the weapons could fall into the hands of extremists			0
but a @entity157 source said @entity59 would ‘ look again ’ at its options in the wake of the latest outrage			0
yesterday the @entity47 revealed the number of children fleeing the conflict had passed one million			0
the @entity47 ’s refugee agency and @entity165 described the figure as a ‘ shameful milestone ’ and warned two million more children are displaced within @entity2 .			0

foreign secretary *branded* the possibility that the rebel fighters could have unleashed the chemicals themselves as ' vanishingly small '
laid the blame for the attack which killed up to 1,700 squarely on @entity13
