by @entity0 published : 18:20 est , 6 december 2012 updated : 02:53 est , 7 december 2012 toast of the town : @entity3 is in the running for an @entity5 @entity3 cracked open a bottle of ‘ quite good red wine ’ with her old man @entity8 to help celebrate — and get over the shock of — suddenly being hurled into the @entity5 race			1
the actress , who already has a best supporting @entity5 for @entity12 , was named best actress by the influential @entity14 for her role in @entity16 , based on a @entity18 @entity17 play about a woman completely overtaken by passion			1
she prevailed over perceived front - runners @entity22 for @entity23 , @entity24 , star of @entity26 , and @entity27 for @entity28			1
‘ listen , i ’m more shocked , more surprised than anyone			2
it came out of nowhere , ’ @entity3 told me from @entity30 , noting that @entity16 opened in @entity31 last march in just a handful of cinemas			1
she and @entity8 , aka 007 , enjoyed sipping the premier vino			2
‘ it ’s all wintry here , so it ’s perfect for red wine			2
’ in the film , @entity3 stars as @entity42 opposite @entity41 as sir @entity43 , the @entity44 judge husband she abandons for @entity45 , her lusty @entity46 pilot lover played by @entity47			1
@entity3 gives an electrifying performance as @entity42			1
‘ she ’s someone who falls crazily , madly , deeply in love			2
she humiliates herself and she ’s someone who ’s ruled by her heart , soul and her groin , ’ @entity3 observed			1
‘ people are going to scorn her and she knows she ’s not doing the right thing			2
i would n’t much like that to happen to me , but in drama it ’s a very interesting thing to explore			2
’ she rather admires @entity42 , a woman ‘ who wants to make her life in the way that she chooses to , and i think that ’s very brave and modern ’			1
it ’s too early to tell whether the prize in @entity30 will lead to further @entity67 trophies			2
but ‘ in practical terms ’ , the actress said that the win brings about an awareness for a tiny independent film			1
it has certainly made @entity5 voters pay attention to a portrait of a woman prepared to lose everything for love			1
perhaps @entity3 and @entity8 should order in a few more choice bottles of red wine just in case			1
a winning performance : @entity3 portrays @entity42 in a scene from @entity16 the @entity86 movie @entity87 has turned into a cash windfall for director @entity89 and the film ’s leading actors			1
because it has taken so much money globally ( more than £ 543 million in ticket sales so far ) , @entity89 and certain cast members — including @entity86 himself , @entity8 , baddie @entity93 and spy chiefs @entity94 and @entity96 — are entitled to box - office bonuses said to be in the six - figure range			1
the director and each of the actors could end up with $ 100,000 ( £ 62,000 ) to $ 200,000 ( £ 125,000 ) apiece			2
there are also awards bonuses , so if any of the actors are nominated for an @entity5 , @entity107 or @entity108 , they are rewarded — and they get more if , perchance , they should win			0
a @entity111 bonus : @entity86 cast members such as @entity8 , pictured left as 007 , and @entity94 pictured right as @entity114 head m in @entity87 , are entitled to box - office bonuses because of the success of the film box office bonuses kick in after @entity87 reaches a certain figure , say , $ 200 million and the bonus accumulates the more @entity87 makes			1
and as it ’s heading towards the billion dollar mark , the bounty will end up being a very tidy sum			0
@entity89 and the actors would have negotiated different deals with producers @entity125 and @entity127 , so each amount will be different			0
‘ it ’s going to be in the six - figure range for most of them and at the moment the sky ’s the limit because it has n’t stopped taking money , ’ an executive in @entity130 with knowledge of the arrangement told me			1
actors and film - makers sometimes receive a percentage of a film ’s revenue			1
but @entity125 and @entity127 never give away slices of their @entity86 films , only bonuses for a lucky few			0
@entity125 and @entity127 have been fantastic at guiding @entity86 away from dreariness and they hit the jackpot with @entity87			0
pre-production begins on the next 007 films , provisionally known as @entity154 and @entity86 25 , in the spring			0
there has been talk of them shooting back - to - back later next year			2
in high demand : director @entity89 , centre , talks to @entity8 and @entity160 on the set of @entity87 @entity89 is still mulling over whether he will direct them			0
there ’s no official word , but there ’s a sense that he might not do them			0
for starters , he ’s directing the new musical @entity169 , which starts previewing at the @entity170 on may 18 with @entity171 and @entity172 in leading roles			0
if he directs the @entity86 double , that would mean he ’d have to devote three or four years to being on 007 duty			0
he may not fancy that			0
a lot of changes were being put into the @entity181 musical @entity180 last night			0
i ’ve been hearing mixed views during previews , but i know producer @entity185 and her creative team will turn the show at the @entity188 into a hit			0
once upon a time actor @entity190 worked in the @entity193 ’s box office			0
now he ’ll play lawyer @entity194 , one of the key parts in the @entity193 ’s hit comedy @entity196 , when a new cast takes over — led by @entity199 — on february 4 at the @entity170 , @entity200			0
@entity190 also appeared in @entity201 when @entity202 directed it at the @entity204			0
@entity202 has a splendid new production of that show opening on monday night at the @entity207 .			0
