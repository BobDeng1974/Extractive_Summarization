people who have heart surgery when there is a full moon stay in hospital for less time than those who have surgery at other stages of the @entity10 's cycle people who have heart surgery when there is a full moon stay in hospital for less time than those who have surgery at other stages of the @entity10 ’s cycle , research suggests			1
a study carried out by @entity22 , in the @entity20 , revealed that surgery , especially that to correct acute aortic dissection , tends to result in a lower death rate when the @entity26 is waning			1
the research was carried out to establish the effect of natural time variations on survival rates and length of hospital stay following heart surgery			1
‘ while there has been previous research on the seasonal impacts of cardiovascular disease , there has not been any data about the effect of the lunar cycles on cardiac cases , until now , ’ said senior author dr @entity33			0
he added : ‘ we focused the study on patients having aortic dissection and found that the odds of dying following this procedure were greatly reduced during the waning full moon , and that length of stay was also reduced during the full moon			1
’ aortic dissection occurs when there is a tear in the lining of the aorta			0
this tear allows a column of blood to enter the aortic wall forcing the layers apart			0
this causes severe pain and is classed as a medical emergency as it can quickly lead to death without treatment			2
researchers studied the impact of lunar cycles and seasonal variation on two surgical groups – one of patients having repair of ascending aortic dissection , and another of patients having aortic dissection and either aortic valve surgery , coronary bypass surgery , or both			2
they also studied the relationship between the lunar cycle and the length of the patients ' stay in hospital			2
the study also revealed that surgery , especially that to correct acute aortic dissection , tends to result in a lower death rate when the @entity26 is waning the study indicated that patients who have aortic dissection repairs performed during the full moon phase had a significantly shorter length of stay than those who were treated during other stages of the @entity10 ’s cycle – 10 days for the full moon cycle compared to 14 days for the other phases			1
‘ can we always plan for such procedures to be performed around lunar cycles ? of course not , ’ dr @entity33 said			0
‘ but better understanding the effects of the environment – including seasonal and lunar cycles – on our health can help us to better understand these rhythms , and ultimately provide better care for our patients			0
’ the research was published in the journal @entity114 and @entity115 .			0

lower death rate was observed following heart surgery which takes place when the @entity26 is waning ( getting *thinner* )
people who have heart surgery during a full moon stay in hospital for an average of 10 days , compared to 14 for people who have it at other times
