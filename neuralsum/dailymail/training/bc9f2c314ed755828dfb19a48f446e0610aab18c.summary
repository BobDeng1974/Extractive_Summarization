there ’s a brave flash of red lipstick and a touch of blusher for the occasion , but no amount of make - up can disguise the pain on @entity10 ’s face			1
her world is in ruins			1
it is three years since her beautiful daughter @entity15 was kidnapped and shot dead in @entity16 on her honeymoon , a murder so compelling in its terrible details			1
few cases have been more exhaustively examined , to the continuing distress of the @entity22			2
and this is what has driven @entity10 to defy the effects of a long battle with cancer and make a painful journey from her home in @entity31 to @entity32 , where @entity15 ’s @entity34 bridegroom @entity33 is fighting extradition , accused of arranging her murder			1
without the answer , she says , a corrosive mix of sorrow and suspicion will surely kill her too			2
it is all the more remarkable , then , that she can sympathise with the plight of the chief suspect , who remains in a secure mental hospital with post-traumatic stress and depression			2
‘ i feel sorry for @entity33 , ’ she says			2
‘ he is my son - in - law and he is as ruined by this as we are			1
he is ill , and i have sympathy with him			2
his life is broken for ever			2
‘ but he will get the chance to get better			2
what about my @entity15 ? what about her life ? ’ ‘ i believed @entity33 was truly in love with my daughter , ’ she continues			1
‘ i just need him to tell me what happened			1
if he can not , i will never , ever get over this			2
‘ i ’ve lost my beautiful daughter			1
unless he tells me the whole story – this stress is killing me			1
’ today there is no communication between the @entity33 and @entity39 families			1
last week they appeared in court together for the latest round of @entity33 ’s fight against extradition , but the mutual animosity was hard to disguise			1
suspect : @entity33 is facing a murder trial in @entity16 but is fighting extradition on mental health grounds tragic : beautiful @entity15 was murdered on her honeymoon it is a sad end to a 40 - year friendship between the families , struck when part of the @entity10 clan settled in @entity34 after @entity96 ’s 1972 purge of @entity97			1
meanwhile @entity15 ’s side of the family settled in @entity31			2
it had seemed appropriate when in 2010 two good - looking children – 30 - year - old @entity33 , a millionaire businessman , and @entity15 , 28 – were married in a lavish £ 200,000 ceremony in @entity104			1
as the world now knows , the happiness was short - lived			1
the @entity107 had only just returned to @entity31 when they received the phone call from @entity33 saying @entity15 had been kidnapped			2
ill - fated : @entity33 and @entity15 married in 2010 ‘ we had n’t even unpacked , ’ recalls @entity109 , @entity15 ’s 64 - year - old father			1
‘ @entity15 called me and said , “ @entity111 , i could n’t take care of your daughter			1
” i said , “ @entity33 , she ’s not dead			2
i ’m coming , we ’ll pay them whatever they want and we ’ll get her back			2
” ‘ but he just said it again , “ i could not take care of your daughter			1
” ’ as if he knew her fate already			0
’ mr @entity109 got the next flight to @entity16 , but during a stop - over in @entity125 was told the nightmare news that @entity15 had been found , dead , in an abandoned taxi			1
the circumstances of her death seemed strange from that first call			0
according to @entity15 , @entity15 had wanted to see ‘ the real @entity16 ’ so they hired a taxi driver to take them to @entity135 township , a dangerous suburb of @entity137 where their car was hijacked at gunpoint			0
to this day , @entity15 ’s mother can not understand why her daughter would have wanted to go to such a place			1
‘ @entity33 knew that area was not good , ’ mrs @entity10 says			0
‘ no one really goes there at night			0
they were staying in @entity148 and she would have loved the nightlife around there			0
she would never have recommended they go to @entity135 in the middle of the night			0
’ when @entity15 was named as a suspect by @entity16 authorities , @entity10 and @entity109 were shocked			0
‘ how can you ever think that about the man you gave your little baby away to ? ’ asks mr @entity109			0
but the @entity16 police had no such doubts			0
they accused @entity15 of paying the couple ’s taxi driver , @entity160 , to arrange for a hitman to kill his new wife and make it look like the work of violent criminals			0
their car was hijacked at gunpoint			0
@entity15 claims the criminals let him and @entity160 go , before driving off with his bride			0
@entity15 was never seen alive again			0
@entity160 told @entity16 police he had been approached by @entity15 and asked to organise the killing			1
his 25 - year sentence for murder was cut by seven years in return for this testimony			1
@entity16 and @entity34 police began a new line of enquiry in 2011 after @entity181 , a @entity182 male prostitute , claimed @entity15 had paid for sex sessions with him			0
family : @entity15 's mother @entity10 ( left ) and @entity33 's father @entity186 ( far right ) attend court for his extradition hearing he also said @entity33 , who made his money through the family care home business , had told him he needed to find a way out of his engagement , but could not do so easily for fear of being disowned by his family			1
@entity15 strenuously denies these accusations and says he is not gay			0
@entity15 took a year off between finishing university and finding a job to care for her mother following the discovery that @entity10 had cancer of the uterus in 2006			0
thankfully , she is now clear of cancer , but the side effects of the treatment continue to plague her			0
‘ the doctors say she should not have any stress , ’ says mr @entity109			0
‘ but every day is a stress for her with this case			0
@entity33 ’s lawyer is always saying , “ his health , his health , his health ”			0
has she thought of our health ? ‘ meanwhile , the case grinds on			0
at @entity221 magistrates ’ court last week , @entity15 ’s defence team asked for a six - month adjournment , arguing @entity15 ’s recovery could be irreparably damaged if he was extradited			1
@entity33 remains at a secure @entity225 mental hospital and did not attend the hearing , being deemed mentally unfit			0
chief magistrate @entity227 will rule on the case later this month			0

@entity39 speaks as son - in - law fights extradition over murder charges
she said not knowing what happened to her daughter is ' killing her '
