it 's not every day that you enter into battle with @entity3 on a race track , and it 's not every day that you beat him either			1
so , with that in mind , my very intimate karting date with the @entity9 superstar earlier this month must be considered an enormous success			0
move over , @entity3 ; @entity13 has a new racing star in town			1
while there is moisture in the air , and the clouds are darkening , for now it is dry			0
the brief is simple ; we would contest a 15 - minute qualifying session to decide the order of the grid before participating in a race of the same duration			1
@entity3 , who started his career here at the tender age of just eight , would start from the back of the pack			1
this was the 2008 world champion 's stomping ground when he was growing up			1
it is a track he knows well , and one that we did n't			2
perhaps he felt he needed a challenge ? after securing pole ahead of my @entity25 rivals , i knew the start to this most surreal of races would be imperative			2
sitting stationary on the grid and waiting for my competitors to take up their respective positions , my heart begins to pound through my overalls and my breathing intensifies			0
but suddenly , the green flag drops and we 're racing			0
i pull immediately to my left to secure the racing line ahead of the opening , long , sweeping right hander			0
go : the green flag drops as the racers get going with @entity3 taking up at the back from the back : @entity3 , in his shiny white @entity9 overalls and golden helmet , prepares to go it 's a promising start , and with a quick glance over my shoulder , i see the field jostling for position behind me			1
while we 're all dressed in black , @entity3 , in his shiny white @entity9 overalls and golden helmet , is already on the move			1
it 's a scruffy start to the race			1
i miss both apexes at the ensuing two hairpins , but as we enter the pit straight for the first time , somehow i have managed to retain the lead of the race			2
i glance around once more , and the yellow flags are out			0
there has been an accident at the back of the pack , but @entity3 has emerged from the melee unscathed , and from what i can see , it appears as though he is already up to fourth			1
i knew it would n't be long before the 29 - year - old would be breathing down my neck			0
keeping him at bay : @entity3 jostles for position with @entity19 no fair : @entity3 knows the @entity33 track well as he levels with our man on a bend we 're midway through the second lap , and indeed here he comes			1
as we exit the hairpin , @entity3 gets the better drive and draws alongside me			1
we glide along the pit - straight and look directly at one other , before he gestures that i take the corner ahead of him by holding out his left hand			0
i 'm sure that 's the first , and probably only time , he 's ever done that in his motor racing career			0
' what a gent ' , i think , only to realise that his act of goodwill is for his own personal pleasure			0
indeed , he would spend the course of the lap toying with me ; much in the same vein as my pet cat does with her prey in the garden			0
in this case , i am the helpless mouse			0
@entity3 knows he will get me eventually , but he is going to make sure he has fun doing it			1
he relentlessly bumps the back of my kart along the back straight - a tactic he says he employed throughout his junior career - before diving underneath me at the right hander and securing the lead of the race			2
joker : @entity3 toyed with the racers on track like a cat does with its prey in the garden my resistance lasted the best part of 1600 metres , some 85 seconds , but in the blink of an eye it is over , and @entity3 sails off into the distance despite my best efforts to cling on to the back of his four - stroke engine			1
fortunately , the @entity9 man 's charitable side returns , and he slows down to let his flock of sheep catch up			2
his act of kindness ultimately allows me to clinch the win			0
a false victory perhaps , but i 'll always be able to tell the story of the day i beat @entity3			2
' you 're all pretty bad at karting , ' @entity3 says afterwards as we catch our breath in the clubhouse			2
he turns to his left , before addressing my @entity178 colleague and i : ' you two were ok			0
' it 's not exactly a glowing endorsement , but it will do			0
until next time , @entity3 â€¦ end : @entity3 did n't win , albeit because of his charitable side , and let our man catch up to pass first verdict : @entity3 said @entity19 and one of his fellow racers ' were ok ' after the race			1

@entity3 races @entity20 's @entity19 at @entity33 track
it is the stomping ground of @entity3 since the age of just eight
@entity3 *mercilessly* lets our man win after toying with him for the 15 - minute race
