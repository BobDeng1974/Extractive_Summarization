by @entity0 an 18 - year - old girl suffering an ultra-rare and life - threatening condition requires treatment with the ' world 's most expensive drug ' to survive - at the staggering cost of $ 24,000 per fortnight , none of which is subsidised by @entity10 or the @entity11			1
@entity13 teen @entity12 is one of just 70 @entity14 who suffer from the rare genetic disease atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome ( @entity17 )			1
caused by a problem in the immune system , it can result in blood clots that can destroy internal organs			0
the illness is both debilitating and deadly , and miss @entity12 requires frequent hospital visits where she receives the drug @entity26 , which effectively stalls the disease and can even repair chronic kidney damage			1
the treatment costs ms @entity12 's mother @entity30 $ 24,000 per fortnightly dose			1
' without a doubt @entity26 is the most expensive drug in the world , ' said ms @entity30			1
' it is the only treatment in the whole world for @entity17			1
' @entity12 was diagnosed with @entity17 , which can strike at any age , when she was seven months old			1
she then found out then that her uncle had died of the disease as a child			0
unusually , the illness lay dormant in @entity12 before resurfacing late last year , just a few weeks after she finished high school			2
@entity12 's mother @entity30 ( left ) discovered a drug that could treat @entity17 , called @entity26 , which costs $ 24,000 per fortnightly dose @entity12 was first diagnosed with the life - threatening illness when she was seven months old ( pictured here after her initial diagnosis ) so far ms @entity30 has been able to pay for five courses of the treatment , with help from her family and from donations @entity26 is currently available at a subsidised rate for people suffering with another ultra-rare disease , called paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria ( @entity79 ) through the @entity80 ( @entity80 )			1
it was being considered by the @entity80 as a treatment for @entity17 when the @entity80 was put under review by the federal government earlier this year			2
the drug was then moved for consideration to the @entity87 ( @entity87 )			0
the @entity87 recommended that @entity26 be subsidised under the @entity88 for sufferers of @entity17 , though there are still several bureaucratic steps to go through before any subsidy will come into effect			1
@entity94 , a representative of the @entity95 said that the @entity87 recommendation leaves many questions unanswered			0
of particular concern , she says , is that under the proposed conditions , patients will only be eligible for the drug is they are currently experiencing a flare - up of the condition , and will only be allowed to take the drug for six months after they have recovered from the attack , even though it is recommended that sufferers remain on the drug for the duration of their lives			2
' sufferers want to know who will qualify for @entity26 , whether they 'll be able to stay on it long - term , there are so many question marks , ' she said			2
' the tragedy is there 's a drug that 's available , that works , and it sits on pharmacy shelves , the doctors want to be able to prescribe it but they ca n't			2
' a spokesperson for the @entity122 confirmed that it was currently in negotiations with @entity125 , who hold the patent for the drug			0
@entity125 were contacted for comment			0
' @entity130 noticed symptoms and she took me to hospital and they told me the @entity17 had come back			2
since then i was faced with this terrible battle , ' she said			0
' i could n't keep any food down , i was always vomiting , i could n't stand up , i 'd feel very dizzy , i had fevers … sadly i have chronic kidney failure now			0
' she required an endless run of hospital visits – with @entity12 requiring eight - hour stretches of dialysis three to four days a week , as well as plasma infusions – before ms @entity30 heard of @entity26			1
' thank @entity144 for @entity145 ! ' she said			0
ms @entity30 was able to fund five doses of the drug , with the help of her family and friends , and two further doses were bought using donations , including a $ 19,000 donation from @entity12 's school and an anonymous $ 10,000 donation			1
' i am so grateful for that , ' said @entity12			0
' i thank everyone for that			0
' since starting on @entity26 on @entity159 , @entity12 has turned a corner			1
she still requires dialysis , but the plasma infusions , which she describes as ' weird ' and ' scary ' have stopped , her hours in hospital have significantly decreased and she is feeling much better			0
her blood tests are also showing vastly improved results , with the nephrologist telling @entity12 on monday that if her results continue in the direction they 're going she might be able to come off dialysis			0
but with the cost of @entity26 currently so high , it was cost $ 680,000 a year to keep her on the drug , @entity12 and her mother do not have the money to buy their next dose , which @entity12 is due to take on thursday june 19			1
without @entity26 , @entity12 will likely deteriorate , and if left too long , the damage to her kidney will be so severe that she will have to remain on dialysis for the rest of her life			1
' she 's 17 , can you imagine a lifetime of chronic kidney failure ? and when i say a lifetime , it 's not going to be a long life , ' said ms @entity30			0
ms @entity30 is frustrated at @entity190 , the @entity191 company that produce @entity26 and own the patent for the drug			2
' on the one hand $ 680,000 a year to save your child 's life is a big price , it 's too high , ' she said			2
however , most of her anger is directed at the @entity14 government , which she says is ' a system that we thought was there to protect and look after us [ and ] has in a way let us down '			0
' it baffles me how could you justify fuelling aeroplanes to go and look for an aeroplane that ’s who knows where			0
but when someone needs mediciine , and it is the only medicine that is available , you sit there and negotiate and it might take six months , ' she said			0

@entity12 ( pictured right going to her school formal just before the @entity17 resurfaced ) is @entity30 's only child the 18 - year - old is trying to stay positive despite her chronic condition @entity26 costs $ 24,00 for each dose of the drug			1
