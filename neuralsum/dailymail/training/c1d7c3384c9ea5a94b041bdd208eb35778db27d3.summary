by @entity0 published : 17:36 est , 27 february 2013 updated : 17:42 est , 27 february 2013 demand : @entity1 , pictured in 2004 , is one of the 702 law professionals who have signed the letter hundreds of lawyers , including some of the country ’s most eminent qcs , today launch a devastating attack on @entity8 plans for secret courts as ‘ contrary to the rule of law ’ and demand they are dropped			1
more than 700 figures from the legal profession insist that the government ’s @entity16 is ‘ dangerous and unnecessary ’ and will ‘ fatally undermine ’ the fairness of court hearings			1
the group of 702 , which includes 38 qcs , says in a letter published in today ’s @entity23 that the proposals to allow a huge extension of court hearings behind closed doors will ‘ erode core principles of our civil justice system ’ by undermining the right to a fair trial and open justice			1
they include @entity35 , former chairman of the @entity37 , reverend @entity38 , a lieutenant colonel who was the @entity40 ’s most senior lawyer during the @entity42 war , and @entity1 , who resigned as a security - cleared special advocate in protest at the existing use of secret justice			1
the intervention of such a significant number of lawyers is a shattering blow for the government , which had been hoping to get the legislation through @entity53 as quietly as possible following months of controversy			2
it is expected to return to the @entity56 next week			2
in another setback for the government , a group of international organisations , including the @entity61 and similar bodies from @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68 , also expressed concerns about the @entity70 in a joint statement			2
it warned : ‘ if the @entity73 @entity53 passes this proposal into law it will be a huge setback for those of us fighting to secure truth and fairness from our own governments and within our own justice systems across the world			1
’ the @entity23 has led criticism of @entity8 plans to allow so - called ‘ closed material procedures ’ ( @entity85 ) , in which cases are conducted entirely in private , in civil hearings			1
defendants or claimants will not allowed to be present , know or challenge the case against them and must be represented by a security - cleared special advocate , rather than their own lawyer			0
currently , such procedures are used in tiny numbers of immigration and deportation hearings , but the government wants to extend them across the civil courts in cases deemed to involve national security			1
secret court : those who have signed the letter say court hearings behind closed doors ' erodes civil justice system core principles ' the legislation has been drafted in close cooperation with the security services , who have claimed other countries may stop sharing intelligence with @entity73 if it risks being disclosed in open court			1
but critics say the proposals are simply designed to ensure potentially embarrassing cases are conducted behind closed doors			1
reverend @entity38 , one of the most prominent signatories of today ’s letter , said : ‘ the @entity16 has one principle aim and that is to cover up @entity73 complicity in rendition and torture			1
‘ the @entity70 is an affront to the open justice on which this country rightly prides itself and , above all , it is an affront to human dignity			1
the fact that some of those individuals who are complicit in rendition and torture can not only assist in the drafting of the @entity70 but also vote to cover their tracks is a constitutional scandal			0
‘ it is little wonder that the @entity70 has been heavily criticised by the @entity137 on torture and condemned by the vast majority of lawyers and human rights organisations in this country			0
’ @entity142 , one of the country 's leading public law specialists , warned the government that if it pressed ahead judges might refuse to preside over secret courts			2
‘ secret trials undermine the principles of open justice and natural justice on which the rule of law is built			1
by promoting the spread of secrecy , state authorities become self - immunised from proper public scrutiny , and in relation to the very types of actions which most need it , ’ he said			0
‘ @entity53 is unwisely provoking the untapped power of our unwritten constitution which it could come to regret			0
the last word will not be @entity53 's , but that of judges asked to preside over secret courts			0
an unwise @entity53 may be about to find that it has constitutional limits , when the rule of law fights back			2
’ @entity169 said : ‘ the extension of closed material procedures is not necessary for public protection			2
the state is already free to withhold evidence from disclosure under @entity177 procedures			0
what is not fair , or just , is evidence being shown in secret to the judge who decides the case on the basis of that evidence			0
‘ in those cases where disclosure of torture or other human rights abuses by the @entity73 government or its agents is sought , the public interest surely requires that to be brought into the open			0
’ @entity194 , a former special advocate and another signatory , said : ‘ closed material procedures are alien to @entity73 justice and will distort civil trials beyond recognition			1
' what may look and sound like a trial is in fact nothing of the sort			0
judges will be asked to decide cases on the basis of " secret evidence " that would not withstand legal challenge and hand down judgments in secret			0
this @entity70 is a dangerous perversion of our national legal system and will undermine constitutional rights			2
’ @entity213 , director of civil rights group @entity214 , said : ‘ when will the coalition that once championed civil liberties listen to the condemnation of its secret courts proposals ? ‘ @entity214 was dismissed as the reactionary human rights lobby - but now legal and international communities have joined the opposition to secret stitch - ups between government and judges , with victims , press and public shut outside			2
secret justice is a complete perversion - it is no justice at all			2
’ minister without portfolio @entity230 , who is in charge of the legislation , will today table further amendments supposed to address some of the concerns of critics			0
they mean a judge must be satisfied that the government has considered whether to make a claim for public interest immunity before making an application for a secret hearing as one of the tests to be met			0
mr @entity230 is also proposing an annual report on the operation of closed hearings and a full review after five years			1
he said : ‘ with these final amendments the government has gone to extreme lengths to meet every practical legal objection that has been made about the @entity70			0
the judge now has total discretion over whether to order a closed material procedure following an application either by the government , the claimant , or from the court of its own motion			1
‘ i do not believe closed material procedures are ideal , but in the very exceptional circumstances where national security is at stake , they offer the only practical means of delivering justice where otherwise there would be none			1
‘ @entity272 already exist in our justice system and the government does lose in them – sometimes to the great anger of the @entity23 ’s readers			1
‘ this bill is now proportionate , sensible and necessary			0
it resolves the highly unsatisfactory legal no - man ’s land we have at the moment where national security cases can be brought , but not resolved			0
‘ of course these amendments will not reassure the @entity70 ’s hardline critics , who prefer silence to judicial decisions on allegations of kidnap and torture , and are prepared to accept that millions of pounds could go without challenge to individuals who could be terrorists			0
these final amendments should now resolve all right thinking citizens that this is a sensible , worthwhile @entity70 which they would give their support to			0
' there are few governments in the world who would go to these lengths to ensure that we will uphold justice and the rule of law in the process of securely safeguarding the safety of our citizens and the national interest			1
