last summer , for a party at home in @entity3 , we thought it would be fun to make an earth oven where you dig a hole in the garden , light a fire and cook meat — in this case , lamb — in the ground			0
but by 7pm , it was clear the meat was n’t cooking quickly enough			0
already , the children were starting to go rogue			0
i had lots of mouths to feed , but nothing to put on plates			0
if my guests were n’t going to go home hungry , i ’d have to do something quickly			0
i rushed to my larder and breathed a sigh of relief			1
there on the shelves were enough ingredients to feed the five thousand			0
indeed , my sister @entity32 always jokes that we could survive a nuclear winter with the contents of my larder			1
@entity36 ( pictured ) says her well - stocked larder is the pride of her home , and even had a bespoke larder specially made after discovering her second home did n't come with one already built - in i ’m not saying it was something @entity43 would have been proud to put his name to , but from a range of foods that included tomatoes , flour , milk , cheese , pine nuts and chilli oil , i made three types of sauces and served them with pasta			1
my larder had saved the day			1
according to research , the larder has come back in from the cold			1
@entity61 say that half of their customers shopping for new kitchens want to integrate a larder into their design			1
last week , @entity68 was photographed preparing a meal in his kitchen at @entity71			0
next to his super-huge fridge was a modest but perfectly formed larder , stocked with everything from @entity75 to mango chutney			1
some say the resurgence is thanks to @entity80 , with inspirational scenes of @entity82 and assistant cook @entity83 in their larder			1
indeed , the very word ‘ larder ’ makes you think of the cavernous cold rooms found in stately homes such as @entity90 ( where @entity80 is filmed ) , which traditionally were bursting with salted meat , pickles , preserves and fresh bread			1
but you ’ve never had to be a lord to own a larder			1
in the @entity97 , even the most modest new - build would have had a walk - in space at the back of the kitchen where food was stored			1
there was wall - to - floor shelving and often a marble shelf to keep food such as butter and cheese as chilled as possible			1
kitchen suppliers and property agents have reported that more buyers are now looking for built - in larders like @entity36 's ( pictured )			1
' a good larder can even add value to a property , ' says the tv presenter it was the arrival of the fridge in the mid-fifties that dampened our ardour for the larder			1
though the first ones cost the equivalent of £ 4,500 in today ’s money , as prices came down and more people were able to afford one , larders went out of fashion			1
and that ’s a shame			0
in the @entity132 , where summers are baking hot , i can see why the fridge is a necessity			0
but in our damp , cold climate , do we really need quite so much of our food kept at temperatures close to freezing ? the simple answer is ‘ no ’			0
unless we ’re in the middle of a heatwave , most food can be kept for several days in the dark , cool climate of a larder			1
eggs , for instance , should keep beautifully fresh for several weeks in a cool larder			1
tomatoes taste infinitely better straight from the larder , as do avocados , bananas , apples and oranges			1
some say the resurgence is thanks to @entity80 , with inspirational scenes of mrs @entity82 ( right ) and assistant cook @entity83 ( left ) in their larder i do n’t keep any of my jams , pickles or sauces in the fridge : i do n’t want chilled jam on my toast			1
i do n’t even keep my cheese in the fridge , particularly runny @entity172 varieties			0
health and safety would say i ’m endangering the health of my family — but i have n’t poisoned anyone yet			0
to be honest , my larder is one of my favourite things in our home			2
there was already a larder in our house in @entity3 , so when we moved into our second house in @entity186 nine years ago , i had one built into the kitchen			1
it ’s 5ft by 6ft , with four deep shelves around three of the walls			0
it has a wine rack and spice rack , as well as a free - standing rack for veg			2
true to tradition , there ’s a marble shelf and a small window , which we keep open			0
@entity36 ( pictured ) loves her larder so much , she chooses to use it more frequently than her fridge			1
' not only does food taste better , there ’s also far less waste , ' says the location , location star my partner @entity209 hated it and wanted me to knock it down as soon as he saw it			0
i stood my ground , and he now admits it ’s one of the great triumphs in the house			2
to start with , i confess , my use of the shelves was pretty chaotic			0
but a few years ago , while we were on holiday , our super-organised nanny @entity219 rearranged all the shelves			0
she bought dozens of containers and jars from @entity225 and transformed that little room			0
now , i ’m a slave to its military precision			0
sometimes , i ’ll go in and just stand there , admiring the neatly lined - up packets and jars			2
i took a picture of it at its tidiest and attached it to the door , with a note : ‘ @entity236 this way ! ’ as we only have two cupboards in our entire kitchen , it ’s not just food that we keep in the larder			2
our medicines , alcohol , mixers , @entity247 , picnic stuff and thermos flasks are stored there , too			0
@entity36 reveals that she now only has two storage cupboards in her kitchen ( pictured ) , instead storing everything from spices and sauces to alcohol , medicines , @entity258 and picnic sets in her beloved larder the only things we do n’t keep in it are chemicals for cleaning and washing			1
we do own a fridge			0
in fact , we recently got our first new fridge			0
( @entity209 is a property developer , so we ’ve always had hand - me - down fridges			1
) but while most people ’s fridges are bursting at the seams , if you open the door to ours , it looks as if we have n’t shopped for a month			2
so , why do i love my larder so much ? well , not only does food taste better , there ’s also far less waste			2
we ’re a shockingly profligate nation , throwing a third of the fresh food we buy			0
i wonder how much of this is due to our groceries getting ‘ lost ’ at the back of a crammed fridge ? it ’s so much more convenient to walk into a single small area and see exactly what items you have at a glance			2
' unless we ’re in the middle of a heatwave , most food can be kept for several days in the dark , cool climate of a larder , ' says @entity36 ( pictured in her kitchen ) my tv colleague @entity299 says he ’s noticed an increase in buyers asking for a larder when searching for property			1
that does n’t surprise me			0
there ’s something about a larder that appeals to our emotions to do with providing for our family			2
though i ’m not a hoarder when it comes to things like clothes , there ’s something reassuring about seeing enough pasta , rice and even medicines on the shelves to know that if the shops all shut tomorrow , and civilisation collapsed , i could feed my family for a while longer			0
a larder is more ecological , too			2
these awful @entity132 monolith fridges use an extortionate amount of energy , while even the average fridge uses two units of electric power per hour — enough to run a small tv for 20 hours			2
but a larder , well , apart from a light switch , it ’s energy free			2
what ’s more , it adds value to the house — though it ’s hard to say precisely how much			2
but this is n’t about money			0
i ’ve always said that a house only works if the kitchen works — and for me , the larder is the secret of a truly successful kitchen			1
i would n’t be without mine			0
@entity349 , presented by @entity36 & @entity299 , starts on @entity350 in april .			1

@entity36 says she could n't live without her well - stocked larder
before fridges were commonplace almost every house came with a larder
research shows they *'re* now back in fashion thanks to @entity80
