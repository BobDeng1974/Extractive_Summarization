researchers discovered chimpanzees and bonobo monkeys exhibit emotional responses to outcomes of decision - making			1
like some humans , chimpanzees and bonobos pout or throw angry tantrums when a risk - taking strategy fails to pay off , according to research			2
@entity17 researchers @entity18 , of @entity19 , and @entity20 , of @entity21 , assessed the emotional responses and motivation of chimpanzees and bonobos living in @entity27 sanctuaries			1
these chimpanzees were study subjects at the @entity29 in @entity30 , @entity31			0
researchers discovered chimpanzees and bonobo monkeys exhibit emotional responses to outcomes of decision - making			1
doctor @entity18 said : ' psychologists and economists have found that emotions play a critical role in shaping how humans make complex decisions , such as decisions about saving or investing money			0
' but it was not known if these processes are shared with other animals when they make decisions about their important resources - such as food			0
' the apes in the study faced two different types of problems : one where they made choices about whether to wait to obtain larger rewards , and one where they made choices about whether to take a chance to obtain a high - quality treat , but risk obtaining a non-preferred food item if their gamble did not pay off			0
one of the bonobos who was a study subject at @entity65 in @entity66 , @entity67 the scientists found that both species displayed emotional responses to the outcome of their choice , but chimpanzees were more patient and likely to take risks than bonobos			1
when their choice yielded the less preferred outcome , both species displayed negative emotional responses including vocalizations similar to pouts and moans , scratching , and banging - a type of tantrum thought to reflect anger in apes			1
in the risky choice task , the apes even tried to switch their choice after the fact when they realised they had made a losing gamble , but never did so when their risk - taking paid off			0
some of the emotional and motivational responses displayed by the apes were species - specific while others reflected individual differences in the animals			2
based on their results , published in the journal @entity93 , the researchers concluded that apes do exhibit emotional responses to decision - making , like humans			1
they said that further research is needed to determine whether these emotional responses to outcomes can change the apes ' future choices and decisions .			2
