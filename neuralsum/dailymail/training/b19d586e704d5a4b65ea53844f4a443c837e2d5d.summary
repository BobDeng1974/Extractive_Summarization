by @entity0 for @entity2 , the diner is a symbol of @entity5 nostalgia as wholesome as the apple pie that was served inside			0
so a recent trip back to @entity8 - 25 years on from when he first lived there as a film student - inspired the photographer to share his old images of the relics , for @entity16 ‘ nostalgics ’ like him as well as the younger generations of @entity8 curious about their past			1
‘ as a pure bred @entity20 , @entity8 had always seemed an obvious destination for me , ’ he told @entity19			1
the @entity22 : photographer @entity2 wanted to share his 1990s photographs of the famous @entity5 restaurants to highlight the changing face of @entity8 @entity26 : when pushing the door of the @entity26 diner , he said , you felt like you were part of the legend of the city , just for the price of a burger with fries ! @entity37 era : i think they were also a type of restaurants which was accessible to everybody , from any social backgrounds , said mr @entity44 ‘ a place i felt i already knew through a personal exploration of @entity5 movies , rock vinyls , art and photography books			1
‘ i finally had the chance to go to @entity8 to become a film student and i started exploring the city from one end to another … always carrying my old nikons with me			1
’ he explained that while the city had obviously changed tremendously since the 1970s and 1980s , ‘ you just had to walk around the corner and enter any downtown dive bar to find the signs and remains of this legendary @entity8 ’			1
keeping up with the @entity64 's : the @entity64 diner was amazing because of its location , ' he said			0
' an old greasy spoon joint in the middle of hip downtown @entity69			0
what a contrast ! he explained that while the city had changed tremendously since the 1970s and 1980s , ' you just had to walk around the corner and enter any downtown dive bar ' to find the remains of @entity8 fusion : this old diner was converted into a @entity80 and @entity81 restaurant , a combination of food that does n't usually go together mr @entity2 focused on diners in particular as he saw them as a real part of @entity5 mythology and imagery			1
‘ you see them in classic films and the ones that were left in @entity8 were really great looking			2
their names were wonderful , some kind of urban poetry – @entity96 , @entity97 – and it seemed to me they were a real part of the old @entity8			1
his favorites include the @entity97 ‘ for its name ’ : ‘ it was really lost on the edge of @entity69 and its name reminded me of @entity105 by @entity106 ! ’ dancing in the @entity107 : among his favorites was the @entity108 , saying that its loss is a ' real pity ' the @entity96 , says mr @entity2 , had a particular allure for its turning moon crescent on the roof mr @entity2 said he realized that many sites documented the disappearing @entity8 neighborhoods and landmarks , with documentary films being released and neighborhood associations fighting the chain stores he also had a soft spot for @entity96 and the @entity64			1
‘ it seemed to be a real part of @entity123 and of the @entity125 area at the time and its loss is a real pity			1
it looked really great from the outside with its turning moon crescent on the roof			0
‘ the @entity64 diner was amazing because of its location			0
an old greasy spoon joint in the middle of hip downtown @entity69			0
what a contrast ! ’ after spending eight years in the city , he returned home to @entity20 , but had a chance to return to @entity8 last september , where he witnessed how fast the city was changing			2
this rapid change led to him posting his old images on his website galessandrini.blogspot.fr			2
‘ this sudden transformation of downtown @entity69 had started before the @entity144 went down but it seems to have accelerated at an incredible pace			0
at the drive - thru : for mr @entity2 , he felt he already knew @entity8 through his exploration of movies , vinyls and art end of the empire : the diners were mainly replaced by glass towers and luxury buildings which seem to lack personality and the classic architecture he believes that current restaurants in @entity8 are now either very high - end or boring food chains all looking the same ‘ surfing on the web , i realized that this transformation of the city is a widely discussed topic , with many internet sites documenting the disappearing @entity8 neighborhoods and landmarks , with documentary films being released and neighborhood associations fighting the chain stores and the real estate development in @entity69			1
‘ more reasons for me to keep scanning my old negatives and color slides kept in an old suitcase for almost 20 years ! ’ most of the diners have now gone , a fact mr @entity2 laments			2
' @entity8 will always be @entity8 and i see young people discovering @entity69 and being as fascinated by it as i was 25 years ago			2
yet i really have the feeling that something was lost somewhere			0
something of the city 's soul is definitely gone			0
' the diners were definitely a part of that @entity8			1
they were also a type of restaurant which was accessible to everybody , from any social background			0
' when pushing the door of the @entity26 diner , you felt like you were part of the legend of the city , just for the price of a burger with fries ! ' now the diners have mainly been replaced by glass towers and luxury buildings lacking in personality , he argues , with architecture that ' will never become as " classic " and iconic as the diners were			2
' ' the recent evolution of restaurants in @entity69 seems to be a good representation of the global evolution of @entity69 as mayor [ @entity213 ] @entity212 wanted it to be			0
they are either very high - end or boring food chains that all look the same .			0
