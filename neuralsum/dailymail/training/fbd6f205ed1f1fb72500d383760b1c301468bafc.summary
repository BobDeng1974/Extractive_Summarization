by @entity0 the relationship between @entity2 and @entity4 cricket fans has often resembled that of a rather tempestuous couple			1
it began , as these things usually do , with a teenage infatuation			0
the only @entity4 object visible from space : @entity2 's hair has been mocked on websites but in subsequent years he proved to be a huge disappointment			1
he developed no consistent away swinger to complement his natural inswing towards right - handers , and picked up a serious problem bowling no balls			0
there was no increase in pace - if anything , he got slower			0
the relationship soured and even turned abusive , as @entity2 became the biggest butt of jokes in @entity20 after the nation ’s corrupt politicians			1
whole websites sprung up devoted to ridiculing everything from his massive mane - ‘ the only @entity4 object visible from space ’ - to the awards he should have won for services to @entity64 sport when his team were whitewashed @entity66			2
by the time he was selected for this @entity70 tour the old love had crossed that fine line into hate , with several observers incredulously questioning how someone with a bowling average over 37 could have somehow won 55 test caps and still be in line for more			0
now , however , the pendulum may be swinging back			0
there appears to be a reconciliation on the cards			0
with speed , aggression and a huge amount of heart , @entity2 not only blew away the @entity87 batting line - up with seven for 74 in the second innings at @entity30 but also won back his place in the affection of @entity4 folk			1
some have even removed the old barbs from their @entity95 pages , and quite rightly too			0
@entity2 , who is still only 25 , probably played the biggest role of all in what could rank as @entity20 ’s greatest ever victory away from home soil			1
carrying the fight to @entity87 : @entity2 ( left ) bowled a sustained spell of short stuff and blew the hosts away cheers : @entity2 seems to have won over the @entity20 public again following his display at @entity30 @entity107 salutes ' memorable ' @entity28 's win they had no right to win the second test , and take a one - nil lead in the series , after being put in to bat first on a pitch that was as green as the outfield			1
they won because their bowlers understood better than @entity87 how to bowl in these most @entity70 of conditions			2
they bowled full and straight with an upright seam and let the pitch and humidity do the rest			0
@entity2 was at the forefront of implementing this simple discipline – seemingly forgotten by @entity127 , @entity128 – which helped push @entity20 into a winning position on the final day			1
and then , with @entity87 ’s last recognised batsmen threatening to tilt the game back in their team ’s favour , came the most remarkable act of all in this fascinating test match			2
having been told by his captain to abandon his traditional line and length , @entity2 bowled bouncer after bouncer			2
@entity87 accepted the bait and - one after another - hooked and pulled the ball to the hands of gleeful fielders standing in the deep			2
steaming in : @entity2 ran in hard on the final afternoon and gave @entity87 some chin music tests : 57 debut : vs @entity148 , 2007 runs : 515 @entity151 score : 31 * @entity152 : 12 wickets : 174 best bowling ( inns ) : 7/74 best bowling ( match ) : 10/108 5wkt innings : 6 10wkt match : 1 it may have been a lemming - like act of collective suicide on @entity87 ’s part , but huge credit is also due to @entity2			1
in baking heat on a fifth day pitch and with an 80 - over old ball , he banged the ball in short with relentless energy and passion			0
in his last seven overs he took five wickets for 27 runs and won the match , using tactics very rarely associated with an @entity4 bowler			1
he outdid the @entity70 at their own game			0
it turned out that the final match - winning strategy was actually down to the skipper @entity26 , who admitted he coaxed a reluctant @entity2 into following his wishes by setting a field that gave him no option but to bowl short			1
indeed , @entity26 ’s innovative thinking throughout the match – can anyone ever remember a wicketkeeper standing several yards back to a spinner ? - provided a sharp contrast to the ponderous captaincy of his beleaguered opposite number , @entity193			2
given short shrift : @entity195 was bounced out just before lunch and @entity87 subsequently collapsed @entity26 and @entity2 are the only members of this team who have played test matches in @entity87 , and they are doing an excellent job of guiding their inexperienced team - mates			1
the innocuous - looking seamer @entity202 , in particular , is the emerging star of this tour			0
while he may be a humble and unassuming character who will never quite live up to his first name – it literally translates as ‘ lord of the @entity207 ’ – he is certainly exercising a degree of dominion over this series with not only the ball but also the bat			0
at the top of the batting order the opener @entity216 is proving a rock - like presence , and it is encouraging that @entity218 is standing out above his more illustrious colleagues in the middle order			0
tormentor and tormented : @entity2 ( centre ) and @entity26 ( left ) speak to @entity87 captain @entity193 even @entity223 managed to win over a hostile home crowd , who initially booed him at every opportunity over his spat with @entity127 , with his swashbuckling 68 runs in the second innings that swung a hitherto even game in @entity20 ’s favour on the fourth day			1
his exuberant sword - swishing celebration on reaching his half century – a tribute to the traditions of his warrior @entity236 caste – showed that , like @entity2 , he has plenty of personality			2
the whole team , in fact , is proving that it has to be taken seriously after a long run of crushing and sometimes embarrassing results away from home			0
as @entity87 are quickly realising , this @entity20 side is no joke			1
high hopes : @entity2 ( center ) celebrates dismissing the great @entity17 in 2008			1

@entity2 burst on to the scene a tall teenager and *troubled* @entity17
however he got slower and became the butt of @entity4 jokes
only @entity4 player ( with @entity26 ) to have played @entity257 before in @entity87
fast bowler reluctantly bounced out @entity87 at @entity30 to win @entity257 for @entity20
