@entity23 midfielder @entity2 could be set for a january move away from @entity5 but the @entity25 accepts that first - team opportunities will be limited following the summer signings of @entity28 and @entity29 , and he may have to leave @entity7 where he has won five @entity31 titles and the @entity32 in a @entity5 career spanning 336 games			0
