by @entity0 published : 17:31 est , 31 december 2012 updated : 10:52 est , 1 january 2013 the first time she saw them they were holding hands in her womb			1
the scan showed two little boys facing seemingly impossible odds – conjoined twins given virtually no hope of life			1
doctors told @entity13 that even if one survived , the other could die soon after			1
in her bleakest , darkest moments , she struggled to overcome the thought that she would have to bury her babies			2
two little fighters : now aged three , @entity20 ( left ) and @entity21 love to whizz around on their toy cars now , after a remarkable operation to separate them , her ‘ little fighters ’ as she calls them have become ... well ... inseparable			1
three years on , the bond between @entity20 and @entity21 is so strong they still hold hands when they sleep , just as they did when they were attached			1
even when they sit together , they usually adopt the same left and right positions that once enjoined them as one from chest to pelvis			2
these days though , they are two distinct individuals			2
and , as their mother will tell you , two little handfuls of trouble			2
the twins are constantly whizzing around on their toy cars , scrambling up the stairs or tumbling around on the floor with their big sisters			2
conjoined : @entity20 , left , and @entity51 before they were separated in february 2010 meanwhile both are making giant strides in their battle to walk with the aid of newly - fitted prosthetic legs , plus specially designed frames on wheels			1
‘ there ’s obviously a bit of competitiveness between them and they ’re pretty fearless , ’ said @entity13 , 38			1
‘ it ’s lovely to see			0
’ one of each boy ’s legs is prosthetic , and @entity13 said the way the twins were joined meant they ‘ shared just about everything ’ – including their liver and the pericardium sac membrane surrounding their hearts			1
but despite the risks , surgeons were able to separate them without life - threatening consequences			1
the boys ’ gift of life was made possible by the brilliance of medical teams at @entity84 ’s @entity83 , where they were born , and at nearby @entity85 , where the 14 - hour operation to separate them was performed when they were six months old			1
an @entity90 documentary filmed @entity13 kissing each of her conjoined babies goodbye and telling them she loved them before she tearfully handed them over to the surgical team			1
thanks to that operation , the twins recently celebrated their third birthday ( with two cakes , not one )			0
but when @entity13 and her @entity100 - born husband @entity99 gathered with their daughters around the christmas tree , @entity13 performed a solemn and deeply emotional task			1
big sisters : the twin boys are adored by @entity106 , aged five ( left ) , and eight - year - old @entity107 parents : @entity99 and @entity13 said the boys are their ' little miracles ' two weeks before the boys were born in december 2009 , she bought two small teddy bear ornaments and had ‘ @entity20 and @entity21 , 2009 ’ inscribed on them			1
weeping , she told me : ‘ the doctors had warned us it was highly unlikely they would survive the birth			0
in my heart , i realised there was a possibility we would be burying them at @entity121			0
‘ i thought if they do die , i ’d put the ornaments on the tree every year			0
that way , we ’d still have them with us in memory			0
‘ it ’s really painful but every year , that ’s what i have done , just to remember how many times we nearly lost them both			0
‘ now i look at the two of them , and see how happy they are , and feel so very grateful just to have them			0
we see them as our little miracles			0
when we are all together in this house , that ’s all that really matters			0
’ the boys ’ sisters @entity107 , eight , and @entity106 , five , both adore their little brothers and barely seem to notice their disability			0
@entity99 , 40 , gave up his job as a chef to care for the family at home in @entity147 in the @entity148 , and is looking forward to walking the boys to school when they start in september			0
experts have said they have an unusually high iq			0
but more surgery looms in the coming new year , and @entity13 says : ‘ they still have a lot of hurdles ahead of them			2
but they ’ve brought magic into our home , and something special into our lives			0

@entity20 and @entity162 were given virtually no hope of life
separated by surgeons at @entity84 *'s* @entity83 in 2009
mother @entity13 says they still sleep holding hands as they did in womb
