the university is currently the custodian of a 33,000 - year - old skeleton that received the oldest ceremonial burial in @entity12			1
but @entity13 , the assembly member for @entity14 , has asked the university to return the remains of the person known as the @entity18 , who was buried in @entity19 , @entity2			1
the ' @entity18 ' was discovered in a limestone cave in @entity19 in 1823 by a geology professor at the @entity4 , where it is kept			1
here , museum assistant @entity23 is pictured with the remains when they were on show at the @entity27 and @entity28 in @entity29 the skeleton , which is actually that of a man , got its name as it was dyed in red ochre , giving its bones the unusual colour			1
it was discovered in a limestone cave in @entity19 in 1823 by a geology professor at the university , which is why the skeleton has been under lock and key in @entity42 ever since			2
it is still the oldest ceremonial burial of a human discovered in @entity12			1
@entity4 said the skeleton is one of the iconic relics of the @entity49 , and a cast of the skeleton is on permanent display , along with related artefacts , at the @entity54			2
the bones were thought to be a woman 's because of jewellery found nearby and were wrongly dated to @entity58 by the professor when they were found ( reconstruction of @entity18 burial pictured ) @entity2 politician @entity13 wants the skeleton to be returned to @entity2 , where it was found			1
the skeleton was unearthed in @entity19 , @entity14 the bones were thought to be a woman 's because of jewellery found nearby and were wrongly dated to @entity58 by the professor when they were found			1
mr @entity13 believes the skeleton ‘ belongs to @entity19 ’ and said : ‘ it would be good to have it back where it belongs			2
it adds to the bigger picture of bringing people to the city and to the @entity19			0
’ ‘ i understand the @entity4 is not in favour of releasing it , so there would have to be some negotiation			0
’ the skeleton was found during at @entity81 - one of the limestone caves between @entity83 and @entity84 , on the @entity19 , south @entity14 mr @entity13 believes the skeleton should be on display			1
‘ but the university has it at the moment and it is not on display with them , which i think is wrong , ’ he said			0
the skeleton got its name as it was dyed in red ochre , giving its bones the unusual colour he is ‘ serious ’ about raising funds to ensure the remains could be kept safe in @entity100 , close to where they found and the @entity18 of @entity103 was laid to rest			1
mr @entity13 said : ‘ i have yet to take the next step which would be to make some sort of contact with the university , to talk to them nicely about it and try to be reasonable			0
‘ they did lend the original bones to the @entity113 in , i think , 2009 , ’ he added			0
the politician said @entity115 if keen to look after the @entity18 , but noted that the outcome is ‘ up to the university ’			0
‘ i have a fairly persuasive tongue in me			0
i hope i 've a chance , ’ he said			0
this week , @entity121 culture secretary @entity120 , who was brought up in @entity122 , spoke with mr @entity13 about getting the bones back			2
‘ when she came down she was quite fascinated by the story and agreed it should be on display in @entity100 , ’ mr @entity13 said			0
however , a spokesman from @entity4 said the skeleton is ‘ held securely in a collections room inside the museum and is available for researchers and guided tours ’			2
’ ‘ @entity133 nor the @entity4 has been formally approached with a request to discuss repatriation of the ‘ @entity18 ’ material , so the question of whether the ‘ @entity18 ’ should be repatriated to a permanent home in @entity2 is not currently under consideration			2
' ' the @entity4 does have a policy on repatriation and any decision would be made by the @entity144 ( its governing body ) following advice received from those responsible for the collection of which this item is a part , ' he said			0
a cast is on display in the @entity54 and in 2014 the bones will go on display at @entity155 's @entity154 .			0
