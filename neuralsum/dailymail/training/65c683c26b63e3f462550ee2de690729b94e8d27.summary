by @entity0 published : 20:01 est , 1 september 2013 updated : 04:42 est , 2 september 2013 the elderly are being denied life - saving operations in a postcode lottery of age discrimination in the @entity6 , figures show			1
some patients over 75 are six times more likely to have operations to remove cancer than those living in other areas where doctors have written them off because of their dates of birth			2
age discrimination in the @entity6 has been illegal since last october and patients can take doctors , hospitals or gp organisations to court if they think they have been unfairly denied treatment			1
the elderly are being denied life - saving operations in a postcode lottery of age discrimination in the @entity6 , figures show but figures uncovered by the @entity27 mp @entity26 reveal patients ’ chances of having surgery to remove tumours , hip and knee replacements and other vital procedures depend on where they live			1
mr @entity26 , a former health minister , and campaigners say the variations are so marked they can only be caused by age discrimination in some areas			1
the figures show that women aged 75 in @entity43 are almost six times more likely to have surgery to remove breast cancer than those living in @entity47			2
there were 325 such operations per 100,000 in this age group in the @entity51 last year , compared with just 52 in the @entity52 of @entity53 similarly , patients over 75 in @entity55 , @entity56 , are 12 times more likely to get knee replacements than those in @entity59 , @entity60			1
the rates are 665 per 100,000 in this age group in @entity55 , but only 54 in @entity59			0
mr @entity26 said : ‘ these figures reveal a postcode lottery of age discrimination			2
in some parts of the country , life - saving surgery is not being made available to older people			0
figures uncovered by the @entity27 mp @entity26 reveal patients ' chances of having surgery to remove tumours , hip and knee replacements and other vital procedures depend on where they live ‘ if things do n’t change thanks to the ban on age discrimination in the @entity6 , older people can take action to make sure they are not treated as second - class citizens			1
‘ the @entity6 should provide people of all ages with the best possible quality healthcare			0
decisions on whether a person receives an operation should only ever be made on the basis of individual assessments and never because of a person ’s date of birth			0
’ @entity95 , of the charity @entity96 , said : ‘ the clear implication of these figures is that many older people , particularly in certain areas of the country , still face unfair , discriminatory and potentially illegal practice in the @entity6			2
‘ everyone deserves fair access to medical care , yet older people ’s health and even their lives are at risk if arbitrary decisions are made about their care based on their age rather than clinical need			0
we can not allow healthcare to be a postcode lottery , with older people in some areas paying a high price			0
‘ the ban on age discrimination was an important step forward , but these figures show there is a lot further to go before every older person can be confident there ’s a level playing field when it comes to their treatment on the @entity6			1
’ the figures – which also compare the numbers of operations for bowel cancer , gallstones and hernias – suggest that the worst areas for age discrimination are @entity59 in @entity60 , @entity137 in @entity138 , @entity139 , also in @entity60 , and @entity140 in @entity141			1
the @entity142 has long called for improvements in the care of older patients as part of our dignity for the @entity150 campaign			0
as a result of last year ’s amendment to the @entity154 making age discrimination illegal , patients can also take legal action if they believe they have been neglected or not treated with dignity or respect by nursing staff			1
decisions on operations are normally made by consultants			0
in some cases , patients may be too frail for surgery or a general anaesthetic			0
but campaigners say doctors should always assess them face - to - face rather than just looking at the date of birth in their medical records .			0

patients ’ chances of having surgery to remove tumours , hip and knee replacements and other vital procedures depend on where they live
age discrimination in the @entity6 has been illegal since last october
patients can now take doctors , hospitals or gp organisations to court
