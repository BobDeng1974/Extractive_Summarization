or just passing through on his way to the barber ’s			0
but you ’d be mistaken			0
this rather unkempt young fellow is the new face of the @entity3 men ’s clothing range			0
not that you can see much of his face – thanks to the bushy beard and unbelievably messy mane of tumbling hair			1
the brooding backpacker look : @entity3 's new model sports a bushy beard and tumbling , long hair how this type of @entity3 man fits with the store ’s reputation for middle - class respectability and tradition is yet to be explained			1
but eyebrows are sure to be raised when customers spot him on the store ’s website			2
according to @entity34 , @entity3 ’s buying director , this new look ‘ represents what the brand is about ’			1
he added : ' he is a little deconstructed but kind of smart and has a great sense of style			0
' he is a bit dishevelled and is deliberately growing his hair , but he cares about his look			2
' he is a hard - working , everyday - hero kind of bloke			0
' the hairy model in question is @entity45 , 32 , a former carpenter from @entity46			1
the company specifically asked for a model with a beard for the new menswear range buying director says new face ' represents what the brand is about ' and is an ' everyday hero ' the store specifically asked for a model with a beard to show off its @entity60 men ’s label			1
mr @entity45 , who looks as if he ’s just stepped out of a backpacker ’s hostel and is said to have been growing his beard for three years , apparently fit the bill perfectly			1
more traditionally clean - cut models are to be kept to promote the store ’s other clothing lines			2
a spokesman said : ' these particular images are different to what we have usually , but they have n’t alienated our customers and have attracted new ones			0
