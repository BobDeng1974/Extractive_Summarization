by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 , mail online deputy political editor the government is considering making it illegal not to report child abuse , @entity4 revealed today			0
the prime minister 's remarks came after @entity11 chief @entity10 said it should be a crime for someone to keep abuse secret in order to protect an organisation or an individual 's reputation			1
mr @entity4 , speaking during prime minister 's questions today , said : ' should we change the law so there is a requirement to report and make it a criminal offence not to report ? ' the government is currently looking at that and of course both reviews will be able to examine this particular point and advise us accordingly			1
' but he added : ' i think it may well be time to take that sort of step forward			1
in a major change in policy , mr @entity10 , who is leading a review into the @entity62 's handling of abuse allegations , said he now backed so - called ' mandatory reporting ' of abuse			1
mr @entity10 told the @entity54 : ' if someone consciously knows that there is a crime committed against a child , and does nothing about it because they put the reputation of the organisation above the safety of that child , that should be a criminal offence			2
' he also backed the idea of imposing a duty on hospitals , boarding schools and children 's homes to report abuse			0
as recently as march the @entity11 said it was opposed to ' blanket mandatory reporting '			2
the charity previously said it felt ' criminal sanction against those who hesitate is unfair ' , but added that the law should focus on people in positions of responsibility who have failed to act			0
the government has ordered two inquiries in response to growing public concern about the way allegations of abuse were dealt with			0
mr @entity10 is examining how the @entity62 dealt with records dating from 1979 , after it emerged 114 relevant files are missing , presumed to have been destroyed			0
a separate , more wide - ranging , inquiry into how abuse was dealt with in every corner of society is being carried out by a panel chaired by former high court judge @entity109			0
home secretary @entity47 says the wide - ranging inquiry into abuse will examine mandatory reporting former @entity115 cabinet minister @entity114 has urged the government to consider mandatory reporting of abuse as part of the reviews			1
' as there is still no duty to report suspected abuse , ...			0
the inquiries [ should ] look again at mandatory reporting of suspected abuse in regulated activities			1
' i have already discussed that with the for @entity128 and hope that the home secretary will take it up as well			2
' in the @entity132 , mrs may indicated that she expects the panel inquiry to examine whether there are ' any gaps in what we currently do that mean we are not properly protecting children and , if there are , what appropriate mechanisms could be put in place to ensure that those gaps are filled '			0
the prospect of mandatory reporting has been welcomed by other charities			2
@entity147 , chief executive of the @entity148 in @entity149 , said : ' i think this is a really significant u-turn for the @entity11 and hugely welcome - it 's a big step in the right direction			1
' a lawyer who represents 176 victims of disgraced television personality and serial abuser @entity156 welcomed the @entity11 's turnaround			0
@entity159 , a lawyer with @entity160 , said : ' the @entity11 's backing for mandatory reporting is a welcome and significant moment in our fight to protect future children from predators like @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170 and @entity171			2
' this , coupled with an announcement earlier this week by @entity47 that an independent inquiry is to be held , signals we are moving in the right direction - the victims will take some heart			0
' universally the victims i work with say they want change , they support mandatory reporting			1
' we must not pass up this opportunity to protect our children and we must not delude ourselves that outrages like these ones will never happen again - if we do n't act they could			0
ms @entity159 called for mandatory reporting to be brought in in open institutions such as schools , as well as closed institutions			1
' i would urge the @entity11 to go one step further and back mandatory reporting for both open and closed institutions , ' she said			1
' there are examples where mandatory reporting would have stopped offenders in open institutions as well , why should the children there not be afforded the same safeguards ? '			2
