most of the victims dropped into the @entity3 were believed to have been chosen because they had no means of identification or were third - class passengers and therefore could not afford a funeral			2
in the photo - which has a pre-sale estimate of £ 5,000 - one of the bodies is clearly labelled number 177 , which was @entity56 , a 28 - year - old @entity57 man who was a leading fireman on the ship			1
