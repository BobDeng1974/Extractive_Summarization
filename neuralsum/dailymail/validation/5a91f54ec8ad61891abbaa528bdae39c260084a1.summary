it is a common thread through many of the world 's dominant religions that those who do not follow the same faith are barbarians			0
yet new research has now challenged the conventional idea that belief in a powerful and judgmental @entity9 is necessary to form large , complex civilisations			1
anthropologists have found that belief in supreme deities often emerged after complex societies had already formed			1
the stone heads on @entity16 ( shown above ) are thought by some to represent ancestors of people living there and could be an example of where the belief system helped drive the emergence of complex society the scientists studied the development of religion and cultures on @entity30 islands that make up @entity31			1
they examined 96 ancient @entity33 cultures - including those on @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 - that had not had contact with @entity42 religions like @entity43 and @entity44			1
they often form a central part of most biblical stories , but it appears that floods , famines and plagues may have also helped to start belief in some gods in the first place			0
researchers at @entity55 found that belief in all - powerful and moralising gods tended to appear at times of hardship in human history			1
they claim that believing in such a supreme deity helps to ensure people within a society live by certain moral rules that are necessary when living in harsh environments or in times of hardship			0
the researchers studied the origins of 583 religious societies around the world			2
they compared these to climate , rainfall and plant growth data for each area to build up a historical picture of the conditions each society was living in			0
the findings may help to shed light on how religions such as @entity43 , @entity80 and @entity44 first emerged and why stories of hardship play such a central role			2
dr @entity84 , an expert in cultural evolution at the @entity86 in @entity87 , said : ' we found 22 instances of high political complexity through out historically and geographically distant regions of @entity31			1
' the results presented here cast doubt on the widely held view that moralizing high gods facilitate the emergence of political complexity			0
' although beliefs in moralising high gods do co-evolve with political complexity , believes follow rather than drive political complexity			0
' instead the researchers found that belief in systems of supernatural punishment - such as vengeful spirits - tended to precede the emergence of complex societies and civilisations on the islands			1
these tended to be belief in anthropomorphic beings such as the spirits of dead ancestors			2
the researchers found that 37 of the cultures sampled had beliefs of this type while just six believed in supreme deities			1
those that believed in a single all - powerful god tended to be clustered in southeast @entity119 including the @entity121 and @entity122 cultures in the @entity123 , the @entity125 people of @entity126 , the @entity128 tribes of @entity129 in @entity130			1
the names of their gods are @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 na @entity137 and @entity138 respectively			0
the researchers then used trees of evolutionary connections between cultures , deduced from earlier studies of linguistic relationships , to explore how the societies were inter-related and exchanged ideas			2
@entity44 is often seen as having been a civilising influence on @entity149 culture in the past and millions now make the pilgrimage to @entity152 , shown above , every year			1
but the new research suggests that ancient religions like this that believe in an all powerful @entity9 may have emerged after complex cultures had already begun to grow @entity157 evolved a politically complex society but without belief in a supreme deity			1
instead the had a belief system that worked around the representations like wooden @entity164 statues , like those pictured above they were then able to model how the different religions influenced the development of the political structure and cultural complexity in each society			2
writing in the journal @entity175 , dr @entity84 and his colleagues said : ' for beliefs in systems of supernatural punishment , however , the beliefs seem to help political complexity to emerge , although by no means guarantee it			0
' we suggest that the concept of moralising high gods diffused as part of a suite of traits arising from cultural exchange between complex societies			1
' @entity43 has had a history of trying to convert those of other faiths that were considered heathens but it the latest research suggests that supernatural beliefs played a greater role in civilisation than was thought however , @entity200 , an evolutionary biologist at the @entity201 , told @entity202 that he believed the key to increasing political complexity was language not religion			0
he said that societies became more complex as networks of trade and reputation emerged			2
instead he said that all powerful gods perhaps were useful as a tool to help those in power to cement their grip on a society			0
he said : ' as soon as you have a large society generating lots of goods and services , this wealth can be put to use by someone who can grab the reins of power			0
' the most immediate way to do this is to align yourself with a supreme deity and then make lists of things people can and can not do , and these become ‘ morals ’ when applied to our social behaviour			0

scientists at the @entity86 studied *97* @entity30 island cultures
belief in an all - powerful @entity9 was found to not be a civilising influence
religions that followed supreme deities emerged after complex societies
instead belief in supernatural and vengeful spirits drove civilised cultures
