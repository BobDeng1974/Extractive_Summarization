by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 the last thing @entity3 need is @entity4 with added inspiration , but the @entity7 playmaker is plotting a meeting today with @entity10 ’s free - kick maestro @entity9 , the man he studied to perfect his own dead - ball style			1
@entity9 , who spent eight years in @entity12 at @entity13 , has been invited to @entity15 ’s training base two hours west of @entity16 to meet @entity4 , who wrote in his autobiography how he would spend hours scrutinising the @entity19 ’s free - kick technique			1
‘ that man made the ball do some quite extraordinary things , ’ wrote @entity4			2
‘ he never went wrong			2
i checked out his stats and realised it could n’t just be chance			0
’ video : scroll down to watch @entity4 prepare for @entity3 with some trick shots the master : @entity9 has been brought into offer @entity4 advice on his free - kicks idol : @entity4 wrote in his autobiography that he had studied the @entity19 's technique @entity4 scoured video clips and old photographs of @entity9 in action and eventually cracked the puzzle			1
‘ the search for @entity9 ’s secret had become an obsession with me , ’ he confessed , but he did finally unearth the magic formula			2
‘ it was all about how he struck the ball , not where , ’ he added			0
‘ only three of his toes came into contact with the ball , not the whole foot			0
’ @entity4 was the architect of @entity3 ’s @entity51 downfall in @entity52 , dictating a game his team somehow failed to win in 120 minutes of total domination before scoring in the penalty shootout with a ‘ @entity59 - style ’ chip against @entity58			1
he will again be a central figure in @entity61 , where the heat and humidity will make possession more valuable than ever			0
key : @entity15 have not been at their best in the warm - ups , but @entity4 will strike fear into the @entity69 team @entity70 should face @entity3 on saturday with an extra spring in his step after announcing his engagement to model @entity73			1
she posted the news on @entity76 , along with a snap of her new ring			0
‘ there are two different styles of play : @entity15 more technical and @entity3 more physical , ’ said @entity80 ’s @entity79			1
this feeling supports the quiet confidence in evidence at @entity88 , the @entity7 @entity89 camp , in @entity90 , steaming yesterday after hours of rain			1
@entity79 appears in good shape heading into the @entity89			0
yet he smiled when this suggestion was put to him , shook his head and dabbed his brow with a napkin			0
‘ it is so hot , ’ he said			0
@entity99 ’s side have not won since september and failed to beat @entity100 last week , yet this is shrugged off as a typically @entity7 form of preparation			2
@entity99 is vexed by the team ’s defensive frailties , which is leading him towards fielding a single striker			0
specialist : @entity9 's free - kicks were his trademark in a career during which he earned 40 caps for @entity10 @entity4 's @entity59 : the deep - lying playmaker embarrassed @entity58 with a cheeky chip at @entity51 confident : @entity79 believes @entity15 will flourish despite less than convincing preparations even when winning a practice match against @entity117 on sunday — a game beamed into @entity3 ’s hotel for the benefit of @entity120 and his coaches — the @entity7 conceded three goals			1
centre half @entity124 was not risked because injury was such an unbearable thought and his @entity80 team - mate @entity127 is managing a sore heel			2
he is expected to start against @entity3 but could be rested for @entity129 as @entity99 plans for a potentially crucial final group game with @entity131			1
a fever has ruled @entity134 ’s @entity133 out of training for three days , fuelling fears he may miss saturday ’s game in @entity61 , but traditionally @entity15 are seldom more dangerous than when approaching a big tournament in utter disarray			1
@entity140 beat @entity15 3 - 0 ahead of @entity51 and still @entity99 ’s team reached the final			2
the world titles of 2006 and 1982 were won while corruption scandals raged at home			0
‘ that is a very dangerous route to go down , ’ declared @entity120 last week , when he detected optimism infiltrating the @entity69 press corps after the @entity100 result			1
wary : @entity120 agreed with @entity79 that the @entity7 should not be judged on their friendly results doubtful : @entity134 midfielder @entity151 is struggling to be fit for the @entity3 game on saturday @entity15 do n’t do friendlies , was basically @entity120 ’s argument and it was echoed by @entity79			1
‘ we know we have put hard work into our legs in these preparation games , ’ said the @entity80 midfielder			0
‘ we will be ok			0
against @entity3 , it ’s always a great match			2
@entity3 are a different team from two years ago , but we have changed , too			2
this will talk on the pitch			0
’ at @entity88 , briefings with @entity79 and @entity167 striker @entity166 were followed by pasta , espresso and the deep notes of a @entity172 organ which drowned out the competitive noise of several table football games			0
@entity15 are quietly confident ahead of what they view as the pivotal game in the group			1
win this and a draw will be enough against @entity131			0
that , at least , is the theory and that is before @entity9 pops in to give @entity4 a lift .			1

@entity7 midfield studied @entity19 's technique
@entity9 has been invited to @entity15 's training camp to coach @entity4
@entity15 have injury doubts before @entity3 game on saturday
but @entity120 warns against too much optimism
