by @entity0 if you love being outdoors but do n't find sitting in the wind , cold , wet or even extreme heat particularly comfortable , have we got an idea for you ...			1
put one of these beautiful works of architectural art in your garden and you can feel like you 're outdoors all year long , without being bothered by any offensive weather			2
the dreamy tents were created by two @entity28 designers ; architect @entity31 , who lives near @entity32 , and @entity33 , who divides his time between @entity28 and the @entity35			1
the pair designed the houses to create , ' a maximum of pleasure , for a minimum of material and energy expenditure '			1
frameless and virtually roofless , the bubbles are inflated by a special turbine which keeps it in shape , renews the air and eliminates pollen , humidity and condensation			0
the @entity7 comes in three different designs -- from fully transparent ( above ) to almost fully opaque inside , the air is fresh and filtered , there are no mosquitoes and , according to its architects , the acoustics are particularly soothing			0
' the original idea comes form my childhood dream to sleep under the @entity61 , ' designer @entity62 tells @entity63			0
' so that 's what @entity31 and i decided to do -- but in a much more comfortable way ! we wanted to create a cozy hotel bedroom with the starry sky as the ceiling			1
' so what does it feel like to sleep in your very own bubble ? ' @entity77 is the word ! ' he says			1
being structureless , the bubble needs to be inflated permanently in order to support the dome			1
the ' grande lodge ' has a separate living room and bedroom , pictured here at nightfall inside the ' @entity85 ' , one of the more opaque @entity87 , designed for hot temperatures the air being filtered , the atmosphere inside the dome is almost ten times cleaner than outside			1
no pollens , no allergens , no dust and no mosquitoes either			0
there are three different types of bubble			1
the @entity99 , which is fully transparent , the @entity100 , which is half opaque and the @entity85 , almost fully opaque but with a circular clear window in the roof to allow a view of the sky and stars			0
they 're also produced in different materials , suitable for different geographic areas , weather and local temperatures			0
the @entity87 have a bedroom and bathroom and a view of the stars ' the standard bubbles are made of the highest grade of new pvc 's			1
this for standard temperature from 3 ° c to 50 ° c , ' says @entity62			0
' for cold climates , we propose a new @entity123 ( @entity122 ) bubble , suitable for temperatures as low as -40 ° @entity125 ' for very hot countries , we propose our fully opaque @entity85 in a material we call sunblock			1
this material reflects up to 95 % of the sun intakes			2
it 's perfect for hot area like deserts when the temperatures are high during the day and very cold at night ! inside the @entity7 is a bathroom ( left ) and bedroom ( right ) so how long does it take to put up your personal bubble ? ' it 's easy ! ' promises @entity62			1
' for one person , it will take 50 minutes			0
' the @entity87 , which sell to private clients as well as corporates , are environmentally friendly too			0
they are made of 100 per cent recyclable material and are ethically manufactured when deflated and packed , a 13ft bubble in its bag will fit on your rear car seat and weighs only 50kg			1
the @entity7 from above , which is inflated and kept fresh using a mini turbine and how will they withstand rainy climates ? ' i would say that the bubbles are water resistant than water proof , ' says @entity62			2
' in very bad conditions with prolonged heavy rain some drops may come in			0
although we have n't had any complaints so far			0
' ' and in the heat we recommend finding a relatively shady area and propose using the @entity165 version			2
' @entity62 adds , ' being laid in your queen size bed , under the duvet like in your bedroom and watching the stars , the planes and the satellites crossing the sky is an incredible experience			0
' when i stayed in one of these in a wood , so many animals come to see what was going on with this strange flying saucer -- deers , coyotes and raccoons			0
' living in a bubble has never sounded so appealing			2
the perfect setting : the bubble case takes camping to a new level hidden treasure : the bubble tent nestled under a tree			2
