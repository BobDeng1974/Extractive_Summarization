patients are being put in danger because of a desperate shortage of senior doctors , a report warns today			1
it reveals that the hospitals with the highest death rates are located in areas of the country with the fewest consultants			1
concerns have previously been raised that there are too few consultants working at nights and weekends with critically ill patients left in the hands of junior doctors			1
high risk : @entity20 in @entity21 , one of the 12 @entity24 trusts with the highest death rates in the @entity26 , has one senior consultant per 8,000 patients now doctors have admitted their own care is ‘ unsafe ’ because in some cases , a single doctor is being forced to look after 30 seriously ill patients at a time			1
the state of hospital care has been under scrutiny since a report last month into the scandal at @entity40 , where up to 1,200 patients died needlessly , warned that it could be happening elsewhere			2
there has been growing concern that patients are dying needlessly in other hospitals due to neglect and poor treatment			2

’ tragic scandal : a tribute wall made by family members and loved ones in memory of some of the 1,200 patients who may have died needlessly at @entity66 care scrutiny : the scandal at the @entity40 has led to inquiries into further trusts in the @entity26 in its report , the college says the 12 @entity24 trusts with the highest death rates are all in areas with the lowest numbers of consultants			1
they include @entity20 in @entity21 , @entity79 and @entity80 , which each have an average of one consultant for 8,000 people			1

over the last six years the proportion of consultants working part - time has increased from 12 per cent to 18 per cent			1

dr @entity119 , a consultant at the @entity120 and director of the college ’s medical workforce unit , said : ‘ having 30 patients to review in one night is a huge workload			1
