by @entity0 published : 19:44 est , 13 january 2013 updated : 19:44 est , 13 january 2013 mistake : a blundered scheme for offshore wind farms will cost householders billions basic mistakes in the design of @entity8 ’s original scheme to encourage a new generation of offshore wind farms will cost households £ 17billion , mps warn today			1
in a devastating report , the commons public accounts committee ( @entity11 ) said millions of families faced years of higher electricity bills as a result of a poorly designed scheme to link wind farms out at sea to the national grid			1
the scheme was drawn up under the @entity20 during his time as @entity23 in the last government			1
it was then implemented by his @entity27 successor @entity26			0
the report comes just days after the @entity30 revealed mr @entity8 ’s controversial scheme to encourage people to put solar panels and windmills on their roofs is set to cost families an extra £ 1billion in higher bills by 2015			1
the committee ’s @entity20 chairman @entity38 said it was ‘ shocking ’ the offshore wind deals went ahead , given the billions wasted on @entity43 in the past			1
the contracts will provide firms with inflation - proof returns lasting for 20 years			2
yet if they fail to deliver they face a maximum penalty of just 10 per cent of one year ’s income			0
and , as with past @entity43 deals , firms do not have to share windfalls with the taxpayer if they able to refinance on much cheaper terms in future			2
the unduly generous deals will cost consumers £ 17billion over the period , according to the report – or about £ 700 for the average family			1
mrs @entity38 said : ‘ not only is it unlikely this new licensing system for bringing electricity from offshore wind farms onto the national grid will deliver any savings for consumers , it could well lead to higher prices			0
‘ indeed , the terms of the transmission licences appear to have been designed almost entirely to attract investors at the expense of securing a good deal for consumers			2
’ the report said those involved had failed to learn lessons of costly deals in the past			0
@entity84 mp @entity83 , a member of the committee , said it was ‘ @entity87 for @entity43 ’			2
scrutiny : @entity38 , @entity20 mp for @entity89 , has called the failures ' shocking ' the @entity91 hopes offshore wind farms can provide up to 15 per cent of electricity needs by 2020			1
but that will require major investment in transmission infrastructure such as platforms , cables and substations			0
competition for the contracts was launched in march 2009 , with the first contracts let in 2011			0
mrs @entity38 said the department and the @entity104 had wanted to create a ‘ competitive market ’ for offshore transmission – yet the first six licences were awarded to just two firms , @entity108 and @entity109			1
a department spokesman said energy regulator @entity104 was looking again at terms for future contracts			0
he said the scheme ‘ harnesses competitive forces to drive value for money ’			0
he added : ‘ with six licences now granted , now is the right time to re-examine some of the terms			0

*botched* scheme will cost @entity122 taxpayers billions says @entity124 committee
generous deals for firms are ' shocking ' says @entity20 mp
six licences awarded to just two firms
