a single mother who fell pregnant at 13 says she wishes she had been given a contraceptive implant when she was 10			1
@entity2 , now 19 , from @entity3 , spoke out following a report in the @entity5 that revealed children have been given the implant by some @entity8			1
@entity2 , who has a four - year - old son , said on today 's @entity10 that her life would turned out differently had she been given the treatment			1
' @entity2 started having sex with schoolboy @entity21 , when she was 13			1
he was 15 at the time but she said he was equally clueless about contraception			2
' he was a bit older but we were both so young , we did n't have a clue			0
we did n't think it would happen to us , ' she told presenters @entity28 and @entity29			0
the teenager only realised she was pregnant months later thanks to doing an internet search as she was n't aware missing a period was a sign			1
she explained : ' i started feeling tired			0
i was so young i did n't understand about period cycles			2
i only realised when i googled my symptoms and it came up with pregnant			2
' i thought " is this really happening ? " ' @entity2 told presenters @entity28 and @entity29 she was clueless about sex education and did n't think she would get pregnant when she started having sex with a 15 - year - old boyfriend when she was 13 by then she had split up with @entity43 but she knew straight away that she wanted to keep the baby			1
she nervously told her mother , @entity45 , 45 , who had become a single mother herself when @entity2 's father had walked out on them when she was a baby			1
@entity2 said : ' she did n't know i had been having sex but when i told her i needed to talk to her she guessed what was up			2
she has been brilliant and supported me all the way			0
' the young mother said it was difficult to carry on at school during and after her pregnancy but she was determined to finish her education			2
she said : ' it was really scary , and at 13 you do n't know how to deal with people 's comments			0
' everyone knew me as girl who was pregnant or the girl with the baby so i did get abusive remarks			0
' all eyes were often on me and people were talking and whispering about me			0
but i stayed and got my gcses			0
' after a ' traumatic birth ' her son , @entity14 , was born weighing 10lb 6oz			0
@entity2 , left , thinks there should be better sex education in schools and children should be told how they can access contraception to prevent other teen pregnancies , file photo right while @entity2 loves her son and credits him for making her work harder at school ( before he was born she said she often ' bunked off ' ) she thinks other teen pregnancies could be prevented if children had better access to contraception			1
she said : ' i 'm not saying 10 - year - olds should have sex but if they are sexually active they should be offered contraception to prevent teen pregnancies and @entity90			1
' a total of 61 @entity8 across @entity92 admitted they had fitted the implants in minors ( file photo ) @entity2 is now a ' peer educator ' and voluntarily visits schools to talk to pupils about contraception and how they can get it			2
' some students do n't have clue , it 's quite shocking , ' she said			0
' there should be more education about how they can access contraception and they should have knowledge of where they can go to get it			0
' last week , @entity5 reported how @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity114 , in @entity113 , each gave the contraceptive implant to a 10 - year - old during the last five years			1
meanwhile @entity119 , based in @entity120 , gave the contraceptive device to a 10 or 11 - year - old			1
during the last five years , at least 53 12 - year - olds were given the implant , as well as a minimum of 281 13 - year - olds			1
more than 3,000 14 - year - olds and at least 6,300 girls aged 15 were also given the device , which releases the hormone progesterone to prevent pregnancy , inserted under the skin in their arms			1
a total of 61 @entity8 across @entity92 admitted they had fitted the implants in minors after a series of @entity141 requests by @entity5			0
source : @entity143 the numbers are likely to be even higher , as dozens of trusts did not or were unable to provide full figures			0
while @entity2 thinks it is a good idea if it prevents teen pregnancies like hers , others have disagreed			2
viewers took to @entity10 's @entity153 page to debate the issue			0
@entity155 wrote : ' my daughter is 10 and i would never dream of giving this to her			0
she is a little girl and at that age they do n't need to know about this stuff , kids should be allowed to be kids			0
she said : ' seriously why would a 10 year old even be sexually active and which parent in the right mind would even take their 10 year old for the contraceptive ? this is just diabolical and disgusting			1
' @entity169 added : ' would rather we taught girls to respect their bodies and their minds and realise sex is not something you just give away ! do n't put young girls on the pill ! ' but @entity179 thinks @entity2 has a point			1
she said : ' my daughter is 12 and if she thought she was old enough to have sex , then she would be old enough to use contraception , this even applies for kids as young as 10 because , as sad as it , is they are maturing younger now than we ever did			2
