@entity84 , who visited the canyon where the slide struck , said it was completely filled with mud			2
he said the slide struck with so much force that some also spilled over into the neighboring draw			2

from a distance of about 10 miles , the slide looked like a funnel , narrowing into a culvert below			2
it cut a giant channel through trees			0
the creek that once gradually flowed down the ridge now spurted down like a waterfall			0
roads in the area , where some cattle grazed , were muddy from rain			0
like a freight train : the mudslide came down just to the east of @entity63 in @entity6 on sunday evening ' how in the devil could this happen ? ' said @entity27 resident @entity118 , gazing out at the slide			1
while the surrounding area is popular place for fishing , hiking and camping , the slide hit on land with an access gate that is n't open to the public			2
