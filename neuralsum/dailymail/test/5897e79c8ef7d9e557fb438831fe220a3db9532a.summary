@entity0 is creating a bit of a track record for himself - and this one is n't on the starting grid			1
celebrating his win at the @entity6 on sunday , he sprayed champagne straight into the face of one of the hostesses			1
but a leading group which campaigns against sexism has condemned the behavior of the driver - who used to date @entity16 - as ' selfish and inconsiderate ' , saying he should be forced to apologise for ' specially directing ' the bubbly into the woman 's face			1
others have called the driving ace an ' embarrassment to the @entity22 ' , while another said his behaviour showed that he was an ' ignorant clown '			1
' if this if the case we think @entity0 should apologise for his actions and think carefully about how he behaves in the future			1
for most people , it would be apparent that she is not enjoying it			0
' it is surely a very difficult position to be a grid girl and she would have had little option but to stand there and take it			0
that is something of which he should be aware			0
but instead , he appears to have abused her position			0
' it 's unfortunate that a great victory has been marred by what appears to be selfish and inconsiderate behaviour			1
' ms @entity53 added that the episode highlighted the more general issue of women being viewed as sexual objects in the motoring world			0
she said : ' motor racing appears to unnecessarily portray women as sexualised objects and that probably makes it even harder for the women to stand up for themselves			0
we would hope people in the industry would be respectful to these women			0
on @entity101 , @entity0 was described as a ' bully ' and ' disgusting '			2
another user simply said : ' man please stop spraying @entity104 on the @entity105			2
they do n't like it ' , while one outraged user said he was a ' scumbag - an embarrassment to @entity22 '			1
another wrote : ' have a bit more respect for the ladies please			0
spraying @entity104 in her face was out of order # child # idiot			2
' and one tweeted : ' shame on you @entity52 and @entity0 for disgraceful treatment of women during champagne celebration # sexism			1
' it is not the first time the racing icon has whipped out his victory move			2
he celebrated in a similar fashion after winning @entity38 @entity6 last year , which was his fourth consecutive win in a row and the one that finally put him on @entity135 table			1
and although he lost the @entity39 @entity6 to teammate @entity136 , he did n't shy away from popping the cork directly at a hostess			1
the 30 - year - old was even asked to demonstrate his champagne skills on @entity142 's talk show in 2013			1
sprayed : he 's made it a signature move , here @entity0 sprays a hostess at @entity147 at the @entity38 @entity6 at @entity148 but not everyone was offended by his behaviour			1
many found his actions amusing , while another said : ' i can think of worse things to happen at work than getting sprayed in the face with champagne by @ @entity159			1
. lighten up people ! ' @entity0 controlled the contest in @entity33 to seal his second victory in three races and extend his lead at the summit of the @entity52 yesterday			1
but it was n't all smiles at yesterday 's race after a serious feud was sparked between @entity0 and his teammate @entity136 , following a press conference			1
his @entity173 partner accused him of severely compromising his strategy and leaving him under unnecessary pressure from @entity177 's @entity176			0
with the top three drivers covered by only 3.5 seconds ahead of the final round of pit - stops , @entity136 reported on the radio that ‘ @entity0 is driving very slowly			1
tell him to speed up			0
’ @entity0 , seemingly protecting his tyres , was given the hurry - up by @entity173 and both he and @entity136 eventually emerged from their final pit - stop first and second with @entity176 third			2
the world champion , sitting beside his teammate , told the press conference yesterday : ' i was n't controlling his race , i was controlling my own race			0
' my goal was to look after my car			0
i had no real threat from @entity136 throughout the whole race			0
' soaked : it was n't all smiles after a serious feud was sparked between @entity0 and his teammate @entity136 , following a press conference smiles : the @entity173 driver poses with his trophy and champagne bottle on the podium after winning the @entity207 @entity52 on sunday a visibly angry @entity136 replied : ' it 's just now interesting to hear from you @entity0 that you were just thinking about yourself with the pace in front when that was compromising my race			2
' driving slower than was maybe necessary in the beginning of the stint meant @entity176 was close to me and it opened up the opportunity for @entity176 to try an early pit stop to try and jump me and then i had to cover him			0
' it was unnecessarily close with @entity176 as a result , and also it cost me a lot of race time because i had to cover him			0
then my tyres died at the end of the race because my stint was just so much longer , so i 'm unhappy about that			0
' the spat has reopened the wounds from last year when both men tried to out - manoeuvre , and at times out - pysch one another as their battle for the title unfolded			0
it culminated in the pair colliding with one another in the @entity241 @entity6 , resulting in @entity136 being reprimanded and sanctioned by the team			2
this proved to be a turning point in the championship as @entity0 went on to dominate the closing races en route to taking his second crown			2
spat : @entity136 ( left ) accused @entity0 of severely compromising his strategy and leaving him under unnecessary pressure from @entity177 's @entity176			2

@entity0 , 30 , sealed victory in @entity33 at @entity6 yesterday , his second win in three races
he celebrated with ' trademark ' move of spraying champagne in the face of the hostess - much to her surprise
but object , which campaigns against sexism , said he should apologise for his ' selfish and inconsiderate ' actions
others called the driving ace ' an embarrassment to the @entity22 ' , while another said it showed he was an ' ignorant clown '
