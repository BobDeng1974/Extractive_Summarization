@entity1 ’s desire to use commentators across tv and radio led to @entity5 ’s highly surprising @entity7 debut at @entity8 on saturday			1
the 62 - year - old @entity5 has long been annoyed about @entity7 showing no interest in using him while other ‘ inferior ’ @entity1 radio voices have been given their opportunities			1
@entity5 vented his upset in his autobiography in 2000 , calling the @entity1 behaviour towards him ‘ infantile ’ , adding : ‘ there ’s no point in false modesty			1
i know that i ’m a good commentator			2
i do n’t believe there is a good reason why i could n’t make the move to television			2
nor do i believe there ’s any good reason why i should n’t have made that move , particularly since i ’ve seen rather ordinary broadcasters move across			2
they know who they are and you should too			0
@entity5 in the commentary box with @entity32 , @entity5 said he knows he 's a good commentator @entity5 commentated on the @entity34 game on @entity7 despite criticising the @entity1 in his autobiography ‘ @entity35 is clearly happy to do without me			1
’ but 14 years on the @entity38 management say ‘ the past is the past ’ and intend to give @entity5 further games on @entity7 despite the mixed reaction on @entity41 to his first commentary , a 2 - 0 win for @entity44 at @entity45			1
@entity5 has also been doing reports for @entity1 ’s @entity48			1
a @entity1 spokesperson said : ‘ we have a wealth of top - class commentators available to us across both tv and radio			1
motd commentators have been used on @entity54 regularly in recent years while @entity5 and others have featured in our tv football programming and will continue to do so			1
’ @entity57 could be in trouble if his autobiography conflicts with his confidentiality contract with the @entity61 the battle between the @entity61 and @entity57 over the outcast cricketer ’s upcoming autobiography has begun after his agents @entity65 announced the book publicity tour			1
this starts at the @entity69 in @entity70 on october 7 — two days before publication — when a copy of the book is included in the £ 22 ticket price for ‘ an evening with @entity57 ’			1
the schedule alerted the @entity61 , who have not been shown the book and it is understood they have sent letters to @entity80 reminding them of @entity57 ’s confidentiality contract and asking to see the book in advance of it going on sale			2
@entity86 , legal director of @entity80 , declined to comment			0
supermarket tycoon @entity87 bankrolls county cricket champions @entity89 supermarket tycoon @entity87 , who bankrolls county champions @entity89 , is responsible for another sporting sponsorship that brought great results			0
@entity87 backed @entity94 at the start of his career , with the cost - cutter funding ensuring 2013 @entity99 champion @entity94 could go to the @entity102 - @entity101 tennis academy in @entity103			0
the @entity105 ’s delegation in @entity106 for friday ’s @entity108 decision on the venues for @entity110 has unlikely past and present ministers of @entity1 in the party			1
@entity114 is representing the government while @entity117 mayor @entity116 is sending his commissioner for sport @entity119 , who was minister during the @entity115			0
@entity119 is far more steeped in football			0
but on the day she was appointed in 1999 , @entity123 pulled out of the @entity125 to play in the @entity126 and obnoxious control freak @entity127 , @entity129 ’s communications chief , ordered her not to say anything about @entity123 ’s controversial move			0
@entity132 is the overwhelming favourite ahead of @entity134 to stage the @entity110 final			0
@entity87 , who founded @entity136 , also backed tennis star @entity94 during the early years of his career @entity138 made a big noise about their extensive 3d coverage at the 2010 and 2012 @entity141			2
but the doomed format appears to have been kicked into the long grass with a substantial multi-million pound loss			0
there are no @entity146 matches yet scheduled to be shown in @entity147 this season while @entity138 have moved on to testing @entity149 — ultra high definition — at next week ’s @entity151 at @entity152			2
@entity105 chairman @entity154 ’s reform of work permit regulations for footballers from @entity158 countries proposes the scrapping of appeals , reducing permitted countries to those ranked in @entity164 ’s top 50 and stopping loan deals involving permit players			0
surely @entity146 chief executive @entity166 , often the @entity105 ’s biggest obstacle , can not object to these measures			0
@entity105 chairman @entity154 has endeavoured to eform permit regulations for footballers from @entity158 countries			0

@entity5 's @entity7 debut was surprising
@entity5 criticised the @entity1 *heavily* in the past
@entity57 could be in trouble over his autobiography
