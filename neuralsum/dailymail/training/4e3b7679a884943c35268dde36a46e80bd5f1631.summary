the number of women being screened for breast cancer has fallen for a third year running , reigniting the long - standing debate over the benefits and risks of mammograms			1
by the end of march last year , 4.28 million of the 5.64 million eligible women aged 53 to 70 in @entity8 ( 75.9 per cent ) had been screened within the three previous years			1
that compares with 76.4 per cent at the same point in 2013 , 77 per cent in 2012 and 77.2 per cent in 2011			0
of those screened , 17,961 aged 45 or older were diagnosed with cancer - a rate of 8.6 cases of the disease per 1,000 women , up a rate of 8.3 cases the previous year			1
and 40 per cent ( 7,175 ) of women had invasive but small tumours , measuring less than 15mm in diameter , which are often too small to detect by hand			0
the number of women being screened for breast cancer in @entity8 in 2014 fell for a third consecutive year , with 4.28 million of the 5.64 million eligible women aged 53 to 70 ( 75.9 per cent ) having a mammogram while screening has fallen again this year , the number remains above the @entity32 's minimum standard of 70 per cent			1
but the figures have , once again , reignited the debate over the benefits versus the risks of women having regular mammograms			0
it comes as a new study , published in @entity41 , reveals women who understand the risk of over-diagnosis during mammogram screening are less likely to take part in programmes			1
lead researcher professor @entity48 , from the @entity49 , said : ' mammography screening can reduce breast cancer deaths but most women are unaware that inconsequential disease can also be detected by screening , leading to over-diagnosis and over-treatment			1
' in recent years , a mounting body of evidence has suggested breast cancer screening does more harm than good			1
scientists have concluded that women risk false positives , where abnormal results turn out to be normal			1
and experts fear women are being subjected to over-treatment , which has included needless breast removal and surgery on harmless cancers that would never have caused symptoms or death during a patient 's lifespan			1
but leading charities today implored women to continue to have regular mammograms , adding they remain the best way of detecting the disease			0
furthermore , the @entity81 's @entity80 : a strategy for @entity83 published in 2011 , recognised cancer screening as an important way to detect cancer early , adding around a third of breast cancers are diagnosed through mammograms			1
it comes as a new @entity91 study found women who understand the risk of over-diagnosis during mammogram screening , have lower intentions to take part in screening programmes in the @entity99 , the @entity32 invites all women between the ages of 50 and 70 for regular mammograms , every three years			1
in the @entity103 , the @entity102 recommends women aged 50 to 74 are screened every two years			1
today 's figures , published by the @entity106 , show the number of women opting for screening fell across all age groups within the 53 to 70 range			1
of particular note is a fall among the three younger age groups			0
coverage reached the target of 70 per cent in all but one of the nine regions in the @entity99			0
in @entity120 , just 68.9 per cent of eligible women had been screened within three years , while in the @entity121 - the region with the highest coverage - 80.3 per cent of women were screened			1
breast screening is a method of detecting breast cancer at a very early stage			2
the first step involves an x-ray of each breast - a mammogram - which is taken while carefully compressing the breast			0
most women find it a bit uncomfortable and a few find it painful			0
the mammogram can detect small changes in breast tissue which may indicate cancers which are too small to be felt either by the woman herself or by a doctor			0
in recent years a mounting body of evidence has suggested breast cancer screening does more harm than good			2
scientists have concluded women risk false positives , where abnormal results turn out to be normal			1
and experts fear women are being subjected to over-treatment , which has included needless breast removal and surgery on harmless cancers that would never have caused symptoms or death during a patient 's lifespan			1
but leading charities today implored women to continue to have regular mammograms , adding they remain the best way of detecting the disease			0
detection rates were lowest for women aged 45 to 49 and 55 to 59 ( 6.5 case per 1,000 women screened ) , while they were highest among women aged over 70 ( 15.6 cases per 1,000 women screened )			1
dr @entity175 , clinical director at the charity @entity176 , said while at first glance the declining figures may appear ' worrying ' , it is not that ' straightforward '			0
she told @entity181 screening has both ' benefits and limitations '			0
' it 's estimated for every life saved , three women will have unnecessary , often difficult treatment , ' she said			0
' however , screening remains an effective way of detecting breast cancer at an early stage and this can help to increase the likelihood of successful treatment			2
' one of the reasons why the number of women going for screening is declining could be on - going confusion around the benefits and risks of screening			2
' understandably , this can make women reluctant or anxious about attending			0
' @entity176 wants all women to have access to clear information about screening so they can make an informed choice about whether to attend			0
' meanwhile dr @entity211 , research officer at @entity83 , admitted it is ' disappointing ' to see a ' slight decline ' in the proportion of women screened			2
but he added it is ' good news ' that the figure is still above the @entity32 standard of 70 per cent			2
he told @entity181 : ' early detection offers the best chance of successful treatment which is why @entity83 encourages women to attend screening when invited			0
' however , there are some risks associated with breast screening and so it 's very important that each woman makes an informed choice as to whether they wish to attend			2
' breakthrough has developed an innovative online guide which gives women the full facts about breast screening and will help them make the decision that is right for them			2
' @entity239 , chairman of the charity @entity240 , said it is ' disheartening ' to see ' sceptical voices about breast screening have led to the year - on - year decrease in the @entity32 screening programme '			1
he told @entity181 : ' the screening process is crucial to identify breast cancer in its earliest stages			2
the new figures published by the @entity106 found of those 4.28 million women screened in 2014 , 17,961 aged 45 or older , were diagnosed with breast cancer , pictured under the microscope - a rate of 8.6 cases of the disease per 1,000 women , up a rate of 8.3 cases the previous year ' during the primary onset of the disease , many women are unable to detect changes by self - examination alone			1
' the decreased stats prove that more needs to be done to encourage women between the ages of 47 and 74 to attend their regular breast screening appointments			0
' he said it is ' imperative ' that the issue is addressed and plans are put into action to combat the decrease			0
the new @entity91 study , published yesterday , is the first research to examine the effect of including information about the possible harm caused by over-diagnosis and over-treatment , in packs given to women before they choose whether to take part in screening programmes			1
the first symptom of breast cancer most women notice is a lump or an area of thickened tissue in their breast			2
most breast lumps ( 90 per cent ) are n't cancerous , but it 's always best to have them checked by a doctor			0
breast pain is n't usually a symptom of breast cancer			2
source : @entity302 professor @entity48 said the findings ' underlines the ethical imperative for women to have clear decision support materials so that they can make more informed decisions about whether they want to have a breast screening mammogram			0
' ' a health system centred around the individual should assist decision - making that incorporates a woman 's values and preferences , irrespective of whether her eventual choice is to screen or not			0
' therefore , momentum is shifting from uninformative and persuasive approaches to screening communication to clear and balanced information , giving people the opportunity to make informed choices based on their assessment of the trade - offs between potential outcomes			0
' the women , taking part , had not had a mammogram in the past two years , and did not have a personal , or strong family history of the disease			0
the scientists findings revealed those women who received detailed explanations about the possible harms linked to screening , had ' significantly less favourable attitudes towards breast cancer screening , although attitudes remained positive overall			1
and notably , fewer women said they intended to be screened for breast cancer			1
the information given to women was in the form of a booklet and showed outcomes of breast screening over 20 years , compared with no screening , including breast cancer mortality reduction , over-detection and false positive diagnoses			1
a control group of women received the same information bar the detail relating to over-detection .			0

new figures show 4.28 million of 5.64 million eligible women aged 53 to 70 in @entity8 ( 75.9 **%** ) had been screened for breast cancer in 2014
third consecutive year that number has fallen - though figure is still above the @entity32 's minimum standard of 70 **%**
past research has shown screening results in false positives , where results indicating cancer turn out to be normal
some experts fear women are being subjected to over-treatment , which has included needless breast removal and surgery on harmless cancers
new study reveals women who understand risk of over-diagnosis are less likely to choose to take part in screening
