@entity3 , who earlier this year captured the @entity9 welterweight title before being forced to take time away from the ring when he was stabbed while in @entity11 , has long courted a showdown with the @entity14 fighter			1
but @entity0 believes he is a level above @entity16 and would prefer to be matched against the two biggest fighters in the sport			1
' i 'm looking at the biggest names in boxing			1
@entity5 , @entity7 , i think that 's where i belong			2
' if the fight does n't happen with @entity5 then maybe @entity7 is another option			1

however , the @entity49 and @entity50 champion is targeting a super fight with @entity52 titlist @entity7 and dismissed @entity0 earlier this week , saying of the 28 - year - old : ' no one knows who @entity0 is			1
' @entity0 , though , has not given up hope , saying : ' i want the fight , but is @entity5 going to take the fight ? is @entity5 going to give me that chance ? that 's something we 're all waiting to hear from @entity5			1
@entity7 is the other boxer who @entity0 wants a superfight with ' i 've been asking for the fight for the last two or three years			1
now he needs to come back to the press and say , ' i want the fight with @entity0 '			2
' i know i 'm touching distance away from that super fight			0
i think i 've proven myself many times and i think this time i 've proved myself in the biggest way so he has to take the fight			2
what else do i have to do ? ' i know if i can bring @entity5 to @entity75 then i 'll sell out @entity76			2
how big does he need my name to be ? @entity0 arrived back in @entity78 along with his wife and daughter on wednesday ' i think these are little excuses			0
i 'm sure people realise that			0
