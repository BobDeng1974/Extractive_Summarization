a ‘ phenomenal ’ competition , @entity1 calls it			0
the @entity2 endeared him to life in @entity4 , he won it against all odds with @entity6 and felt this year ’s renewal could invigorate @entity8			1
his view of that famous old pot will not be diminished on tuesday morning			0
just when it seemed @entity8 ’s season was is in steep – possibly terminal – decline , @entity11 rode to his manager ’s rescue , volleying in emphatically from close range in the first minute of injury time			1
how @entity1 needed that goal			0
@entity8 should not be a side talked of in terms of crisis			2
they are captained by an @entity4 international , their midfield included one of the brightest young @entity27 stars in the game and quality , from back to front , infuses their squad			0
but they were staring down the barrel here , facing a fifth consecutive defeat			0
@entity34 had risen imperiously in the 54th minute to power in a header that destined to set up a fourth round tie against @entity38 or @entity39			1
@entity41 , who are due another extended @entity2 run , took their chance when it arrived then worked their socks off to frustrate @entity8			1
had they won 1 - 0 , there could have been naco complaints but , in this tournament , you can never say never			1
@entity1 , especially , knows that			0
@entity11 looks to the skies after ending @entity8 's four - game losing streak with a 1 - 1 draw at @entity55 @entity11 ( left ) rescued @entity8 with a late equaliser to force a replay in the third round of the @entity2 @entity41 keeper @entity59 ( centre ) dives in vain as @entity11 's strike powers past him in the final minute of the game @entity41 defender @entity34 ( 3rd left ) opens the scoring with a well - timed run and header in the second half @entity34 races off in celebration as @entity41 keeper as @entity8 defenders ' heads sink in the background @entity8 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity75 6 : @entity76 6 , @entity77 6 , @entity78 5 ( @entity79 71mins ) , @entity80 5 : @entity81 6 , @entity82 5.5 ; @entity83 6.5 ( @entity84 65mins ) , @entity85 7 , @entity86 5.5 : @entity11 6 unused : @entity87 ( gk ) , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , stones , @entity92 , @entity93			1
@entity41 ( 4 - 5 - 1 ) : @entity59 7 : @entity94 7 , @entity34 7.5 , @entity95 7.5 , @entity96 7 : @entity97 6.5 ( @entity98 77mins ) , @entity99 8 , @entity100 7 , @entity101 7.5 , @entity102 6.5 ( @entity103 67mins 6 ) : @entity104 6 ( @entity105 60mins 6 ) unused : @entity107 ( gk ) , @entity106 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity103 goals – @entity34 ( 54 ) bookings – @entity88 referee – a @entity113 6 @entity114 – @entity99 ‘ it would have been a horrendous setback , ’ he admitted			1
‘ we are in a bad run but this showed the dressing room is ready to fight			0
’ this was rough on @entity122			0
the last time he visited @entity55 , he left in a huff , disgruntled by @entity1 ’s overrunning press conference that was delaying his flight home and smarting after @entity41 had been edged out of a tempestuous clash			1
@entity8 were at their most tenacious that november day , scrapping for every lost cause and chiselling out a victory that left @entity1 celebrating more animatedly than normal			2
that was their seventh unbeaten game and suggested they were ready to motor			0
since then , they have lost all momentum			0
any hopes of challenging for a @entity137 place again have evaporated on the back of their worst run of results in more than nine years , leading to an increase in tensions and anxieties			0
this was a game @entity8 or @entity1 could not lose			2
for the opening 20 minutes , neither side looked capable of imposing themselves on the tie			0
@entity41 hoisted a couple of high balls in to test the suspect @entity75 ; @entity8 passed sideways and backwards with little conviction			1
then , briefly , @entity8 began to look like the side we have become to expect			2
@entity81 thundered into a couple of tackles , @entity86 began to get on the ball and @entity11 looked like he might unhinge @entity41 ’s defence			1
the best moment arrived in the 25th minute when @entity86 , sashaying forward in that powerful yet elegant style of his ; a clutch of @entity163 and blue shirts scuttled backwards but could not stop him feeding @entity11 , whose shot skidded wide			1
it stirred some confidence and @entity11 , whose form has been heavily scrutinised , became a focal point ; in the next attack , his ball ushered @entity85 forward but , again , the shot fizzed across the face of @entity59 ’s goal			2
@entity41 midfelder @entity99 ( centre ) warms up with team - mates on the pitch ahead of the game at @entity55 an enthusiastic @entity8 fan arrives early to take his seat and pour over the matchday programme @entity8 players take their places in the line - up alongside their @entity41 counterparts under the glare of floodlights @entity8 forward @entity83 ( centre ) tests @entity41 goalkeeper @entity59 ( left ) during the opening exchanges @entity41 midfielder @entity99 ( left ) competes in an aerial battle with @entity8 's @entity85 as both sides share opportunities @entity11 ( right ) gets a shot away as the @entity8 striker tries to end a run of six games without a goal @entity8 manager @entity1 issues instructons as he strives to end his side 's four - game losing streak @entity4 and @entity8 youngster @entity86 ( left ) shields @entity41 playmaker @entity101 from the ball @entity11 takes on @entity41 winger @entity102 ( right ) as @entity8 try and break the first half deadlock @entity85 looks to his feet after coming close to opening the scoring for @entity8 during the opening half @entity41 's @entity102 complains of an infringement as @entity8 full - back @entity76 ( left ) steams past him new @entity41 signing @entity207 slumps to the ground after missing a gilt edged opportunity scoring at that point would have lifted the mood			1
the thing about the @entity55 crowd , however , is when the breakthrough does not arrive , they can become fractious and irritable and @entity8 ’s failure to find a way through was not well received			1
with @entity99 scurrying around midfield and @entity95 and @entity34 standing firm , @entity8 lost their rhythm			1
the groans that accompanied every ball back became louder as the half petered out , so how they emerged for the second period was going to be key			2
being ponderous and cautious would have led groans turning to growls but getting on the front foot had the potential to stir the crowd and , in fairness , @entity8 started brightly			2
@entity83 lobbed an effort just wide , @entity11 had a header chalked off for a foul on @entity96			1
yet @entity41 were also stirring			2
@entity94 had gone close with a drive that @entity75 did well to turn around and that invited them to press on			0
@entity101 had a shot deflected wide by @entity78 but from the following corner , they made the breakthrough			0
@entity34 ( 3rd left ) loses his defender to open the scoring in the second half with a header from a corner @entity34 is completely unmarked as he runs into space to power home his header in a classic @entity41 set piece @entity41 keeper @entity59 can only watch as @entity34 header powers past him for the opening goal on 56minutes @entity34 wheels away to celebrate his goal as the inquest starts between @entity8 defenders in the background @entity11 ( right ) finds the back of the net shortly after but has the goal disallowed for a foul in the build up @entity8 's perseverance paid off when @entity11 struck in the dying minutes to earn a 1 - 1 draw @entity11 's last minute equaliser came after some intense pressure around the edge of the @entity41 penalty area - click here for all the stats from our brilliant @entity272 the @entity275 striker races away as @entity8 avoid a fifth consecutive defeat and force a replay at @entity279 the @entity8 striker beats his chest after scoring the extra-time header that eases the pressure on manager @entity1 @entity8 teammates rush to congratulate a delighted @entity11 on the floor as the @entity8 look to turn their season around @entity78 , fatally , switched off and stopped tracking @entity34 , giving him space to inflict maximum damage			1
he did not waste his chance , powering his header past the stranded @entity291			2
deficiencies at the back have undermined @entity8 all year and this was another cheap concession			2
had @entity296 took the chance that came his way moments later , @entity1 would have felt the full fury of @entity55 and it would have been difficult to envisage @entity8 mounting any kind of fight back			1
even at 1 - 0 , the salvage operation looked beyond them			1
to their credit , they kept going and just as the board had been held up to show that four minutes of injury time would be played , @entity80 fizzed a ball across the face of goal , @entity41 failed to clear and @entity11 acrobatically grabbed his fourth goal in four games against @entity122			1
‘ it was that man again , ’ @entity122 said glumly			0
‘ every time he plays against us , he scores			0
up until then we had kept him quiet			0
we just ca n’t let this good performance go to waste			0
we want to stay in the @entity2 for as long as we can			0
he just wo n’t want it to be such a close run thing again .			0

@entity8 rescued a 1 - 1 draw against @entity41 in their third round clash at @entity55
@entity41 defender @entity34 opened the scoring with a powerful header in the second half
@entity8 striker @entity11 scored an injury - time equaliser to force a replay at @entity279
the eventual winners will play either @entity39 or @entity38 away in the fourth round
