by @entity0 click here to see the final leaderboard from @entity3 @entity4 has put a very public dig from his former fiancee @entity6 behind him by setting himself up to win @entity7			1
@entity8 , though , has proved her credentials as well , by beating @entity11 @entity10 in straight sets to win the @entity13 on sunday			1
@entity14 is tantelisingly close to victory at @entity16 and held a six - shot lead over @entity18 on sunday morning - a margin no - one has ever blown in the competition before			0
with it , she wrote : ' out and about in @entity45			0
it 's been three years since i have worn high heels on a normal day out			1
# feelsgood # looksgood # shopping # highheels # sun ' she later deleted the post on @entity53			0
it did n't seem to bother @entity14 in his first round on friday , as he hit a second consecutive 66 at the @entity7 to go four clear before extending that lead on saturday			0
@entity6 , who dated @entity14 for three years before they called off their engagement in may , is 5ft 10in while the @entity59 is 5ft 8in			2
difference : @entity6 was slightly taller than @entity14 in heels ( left ) so she wore flat shoes ( right ) mainly not used to heels ? shortly after the stiletto photo she posted this photo of herself being pampered leading : @entity14 made a fine start to @entity7 and was seen with model @entity67 earlier this month			2

@entity14 sets up @entity7 win after being trolled from former fiancee @entity6
@entity8 wins @entity13 on sunday after *easing* past @entity11 @entity10 in straight sets ( 6 - 1 , 6 - 1 )
@entity6 posted photo of herself in high heels earlier in week , *writing* : ' it 's been three years since i have worn high heels on a normal day out '
