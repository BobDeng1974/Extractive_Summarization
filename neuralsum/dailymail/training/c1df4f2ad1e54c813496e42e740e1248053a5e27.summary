bloggers who want to grow their online popularity can now purchase followers - at the risk of potentially ruining their credibility			1
services like @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity10 charge as little as $ 3 per every 100 new followers , a tempting way for social media users to get a jump start and set themselves apart from competitors			1
but some say that purchasing a following is equivalent to cheating in the social media world			0
' there 's respect that comes ... with letting your blog get big on its own , the organic way , ' @entity21 - based blogger @entity20 told @entity27			0
a large price to pay : bloggers who want to grow their online popularity can now purchase followers - at the potential cost of ruining their credibility ' if people would ever find out , you would lose all credibility and that is not worth it , ' she added			1
fashion blogger @entity39 , who runs what i wore , and @entity43 's @entity42 are just some of the popular @entity45 users of late who have been accused of buying followers to grow their presence			1
even political figures are jumping on the bandwagon ; just last week @entity52 mayor @entity51 and his party , @entity53 , experienced a sudden spike in @entity56 followers - a red flag to savvy internet users who suspected him of buying followers			1
in the end , a spokesperson for the mayor claimed that the increase of more than 40,000 followers within just a few days was due to a spam attack - not a bid to make the mayor appear more popular			2
still , people often point to such sudden increases in likes , follows and comments as proof that a blogger 's following is not 100per cent genuine			0
' it 's kind of depressing , ' lifestyle blogger @entity74 said of the growing trend			0
' you think these bloggers are famous because they work for it until you realize that it 's all bought			0
' popularity : services like @entity7 let you grow your following for as little as $ 3 per every 100 new followers , a tempting way for bloggers to get a jump start and set themselves apart from competitors even more depressing , however , is that it tends to work ; @entity45 accounts gain more exposure when they have more followers , so buying followers inevitably leads to more actual followers			1
indeed , a marketing associate from @entity10 - where 1,000 active @entity45 followers costs just $ 90 - explained that most of their clients come back for more on a regular basis			1
' the more active followers you have , the more exposure you are going to get , ' said the employee			2
but a blogger who buys followers can do significant damage when they are associated with big name brands			2
' those fake numbers are used by bloggers to make real money they do n't deserve - income that 's based on what amounts to falsified data , ' @entity106 , who founded blogger forum @entity108 , explains			0
@entity121 grey area : ' if that sort of practice came to light in the real world , people would probably be getting sued , but since it 's blogland , they seem to get away with anything , ' said @entity108 founder @entity124 since companies pay bloggers based on how much influence they appear to have , a lot of money can be lost if some of the bloggers ' followers do n't actually exist ' if that sort of practice came to light in the real world , people would probably be getting sued , but since it 's blogland , they seem to get away with anything , ' she said			2
however , companies have begun to combat these fake followeings with algorithms that show a blogger 's actual influence - disregarding their number of followers			0
@entity145 , for instance , ranks the top beauty bloggers on @entity147 according to their consistency , influence and momentum .			0
