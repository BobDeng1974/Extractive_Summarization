by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 01:29 est , 31 december 2012 updated : 11:45 est , 31 december 2012 over two weeks on from the @entity4 school massacre during which @entity5 massacred 26 people , it has been revealed that his father has quietly claimed his son 's body for burial			1
an anonymous spokesperson for the family who spoke to the @entity13 said that @entity14 collected his son several days ago the 20 - year - old killed 20 first - graders and six adults at the @entity19 on december 14th in a hail of assault weapon fire			1
he also killed his mother in their @entity19 home before going on the rampage and then committing suicide			2
a private funeral was held earlier this month in @entity39 for his mother , @entity42 , who was divorced from @entity14			2
@entity14 lives in @entity43 , @entity4 , and is a tax director at @entity45			2
@entity4 's chief medical examiner @entity46 told the @entity47 that the location of @entity5 's burial will not be made public			1
when asked by the paper if @entity5 's father @entity14 who claimed the body , @entity46 would not comment			1
a spokeswoman at the medical examiner 's office told @entity13 she could not release any details about the status of @entity5 's remains			1
a private funeral was held earlier this month in @entity39 for his mother , @entity42 , who was shot to death in her bed on the morning of the school shooting rampage			2

@entity14 works in financial services with @entity45 and has finally claimed the body of his son @entity5 who committed the @entity19 on december 14th pictured : @entity14 , ( centre left ) , and his new wife , @entity72 , ( centre right ) have collected the body of @entity19 shooter @entity5 police tape stretches across the front yard of the @entity79 residence in @entity19 , @entity4			1
@entity5 reportedly shot his mother @entity42 inside before beginning his killing spree on december 14th @entity19 shooter @entity5 at an unknown location in 2005 - @entity5 's @entity82 is being examined for any evidence that could shed light on his actions that day earlier this week , it was revealed that scientists have been asked to study @entity5 's dna to see if has an ' evil ' gene that led him to carry out the massacre			1
the study , which will look at any abnormalities or mutations in his individual dna , is believed to be the first of its kind ever carried out on a mass @entity97 massacre prompted president @entity98 to look into new gun controls and banning assault rifles such as @entity101 used by @entity5 in his rampage			1
the study of the killer 's dna was been ordered by @entity46 - who carried out the post-mortems on all the victims			1
he has contacted geneticists at @entity109 's to conduct the study			0
geneticists said they are likely looking at @entity5 's @entity82 to detect a mutation or abnormality that could increase the risk of aggressive or violent behavior			1
@entity42 is pictured on a cruise at @entity115 , @entity116 in this october 11 , 2008 photo - @entity79 was the mother of suspected gunman @entity5 they could analyse @entity5 's entire genome in great detail and try to find any unexpected mutations			1
@entity122 , a professor at @entity123 , said the @entity109 geneticists are most likely trying to ' detect clear abnormalities of what we would call a mutation in a gene '			0
he added : ' @entity131 gene abnormalities and there are some abnormalities that are related to aggressive behavior			0
' they might look for mutations that might be associated with mental illnesses and ones that might also increase the risk for violence			0
@entity122 , who is also the chairman of @entity123 's department of molecular and human genetics in @entity143 , @entity140 said geneticists should be doing this type of research because there are ' some mutations that are known to be associated with at least aggressive behavior if not violent behavior			0
' ' i do n't think any one of these mutations would explain all of ( the mass shooters ) , but some of them would have mutations that might be causing both schizophrenia and related schizophrenia violent behavior , ' @entity122 said			0
' i think we could learn more about it and we should learn more about it			0
' @entity4 chief medical examiner @entity163 talks to the media and answers questions the media about the elementary school shooting during a press conference state police personnel lead children from the @entity19 in this handout picture from the @entity172 , in @entity19 , @entity4 @entity122 , who is chairman of the @entity123 department of molecular and human genetics , said studying the genes of murderers is controversial because there is a risk that those with similar genetic characteristics could possibly be discriminated against or stigmatized			2
but he said the research into @entity79 would be helpful even if only a " fraction " may have the abnormality or mutation			0
' not all of these people will have identifiable genetic abnormalities , ' @entity122 told @entity188 in @entity33			0
' by studying genetic abnormalities we can learn more about conditions better and who is at risk and what might be dramatic treatments , ' @entity122 said , adding if the gene abnormality is defined the ' treatment to stop ' other mass shootings or ' decrease the risk is much approved			0
' although known to be shy and social inept @entity79 had not shown any violent streak although he was known to spend hours in the basement of his home playing violent video games			0
first - grader @entity203 and his sister , fourth - grader @entity204 , wait outside @entity19 after a shooting			2

@entity14 wished to remain anonymous when he arrived to take his son 's body several days ago
study of @entity5 's dna will be the first one of its kind and will *evaluate* any genetic evidence for the mass killing
20 first graders and six *members* of staff at @entity19 were killed in december 14 shooting , *including* his mother
