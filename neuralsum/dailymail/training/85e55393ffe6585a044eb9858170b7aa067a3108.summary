a @entity1 airline has sent a warning to its pilots to stop bringing pornographic material into the cockpit			1
in an internal bulletin to staff , @entity6 threatened to sack and / or pursue criminal charges against pilots who were caught displaying ‘ inappropriate material ’ on a flight			1
the warning was sent to employees after obscene material was discovered while an official with @entity16 , the national industry regulator , was seated in the cockpit			1
what 's going on in there ? @entity6 has warned pilots to stop displaying pornographic material in the cockpit the bulletin was issued a year ago , but has recently been obtained by @entity24			1
in the notice , @entity25 , @entity6 ’s chief pilot and director of fleet operations and training , warned pilots : ‘ i am disappointed to have to raise this issue once again but unfortunately we have some people that have yet to understand the message			2
‘ to be clear , this issue only exists on the @entity37 fleet and it must stop			0
’ he said the airline was attempting to identify pilots who were breaking the rules			2
‘ once they are identified they will be subject to discipline to the full extent of the law and our corporate policies			0
this could include termination and / or criminal charges			0
’ @entity6 management warned that pilots could be sacked or face criminal charges if they are caught it is not the first time pilots have been warned about the presence of porn in the cockpits of planes			0
the bulletin circulated last year was issued just four months after an earlier warning , following complaints about pilots ’ inappropriate behaviour			1
a female pilot first started complaining to the @entity66 - based airline around six years ago after finding pornography displayed , glued or tucked into areas within the cockpit , @entity24 reported			1
she provided photos and video of the material , including an image where a knife was drawn in the back of a woman , and an @entity6 investigation backed up her claims , but it remains a problem despite repeated warnings			2
@entity6 says more explicit material was found in february – just months after a bulletin was issued a @entity16 investigation revealed that the pilots are not violating aviation safety rules but they are creating a hazard by stuffing ‘ paper material ’ into compartments with electrical wiring , according to an internal report obtained by @entity24			1
the report ’s author wrote that a complaint that it investigated is considered workplace violence and he or she suggested that the airline did n’t take it seriously enough			2
@entity6 insists that it has responded with additional training for pilots , although it admitted that more explicit material was found in february – five months after the bulletin was issued to pilots			1
airline spokeswoman @entity103 told @entity104 that only one formal complaint has been filed and there is ongoing labour arbitration			0
she said : ‘ the material in question consisted almost entirely of inappropriate business cards and was confined mainly to one aircraft type and route , our @entity113 90s operating to @entity115			0
' it determined the frequency with which such materials were found to be limited			0
@entity6 has a strict zero tolerance policy to protect its employees against harassment of any kind , including inappropriate materials that may offend co-workers			0
