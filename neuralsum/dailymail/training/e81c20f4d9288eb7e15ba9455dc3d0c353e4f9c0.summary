@entity1 ’s decision to sell @entity2 for £ 16m is one of the most controversial transfers in @entity6 history			1
on monday night , after he scored twice in an @entity9 shirt in his first start since a deadline day transfer to @entity13 , it felt like one of the biggest mistakes they have ever made			1
one goal , against @entity19 in this @entity17 qualifier , was embarrassing enough for @entity1			1
they treated him like a son			2
he is @entity13 and @entity9 through and through now , that is for sure			1
high up in the stands , where @entity13 chief executive @entity45 was sat alongside @entity47 chairman @entity46 , they were entitled to a satisfied smile			1
@entity2 ’s double took the heat off them both			1
goals pay the rent and @entity2 , who has craved the chance to start as a centre forward for club and country , duly delivered			1
@entity2 took his chance because of the injury to @entity61 forward @entity60			2
he is the man in possession of the jersey now			2
you can like our @entity65 here three - sy does it : @entity2 finishes off fine team move as @entity9 's forwards combine for the opener crowded out : @entity73 attracts the attention of three @entity76 players his tail has been up for a week or so , eager to please after @entity13 held off the threat of @entity79 to sign him in the last moments leading up to the close of the transfer window			1
this week he will be acquainted with his new team - mates as they prepare for saturday ’s @entity86 clash with @entity87 at the @entity88			2
against @entity19 , a half decent international team ranked ninth in the world , @entity9 played with speed and purpose when they surged forward			0
most of it was down to the mesmerising touches of @entity98 , playing at the top of the diamond and an obvious supply line for @entity73 and @entity2 up top			2
tussle : @entity98 and @entity104 battle for possession at times it was hard to keep an eye on this attacking trident as they rotated positions and popped up all over the park			0
@entity98 , in particular , was an absolute joy to watch			0
when @entity98 spins off his marker , dropping deep to demand the ball off his centre - halves you know that he is comfortable playing at this level			2
these deep - lying missions are reminiscent of @entity119 or @entity120 , the little nuances that separated these two superstars of world football from the mere mortals they counted for team - mates			2
@entity98 is picking up some good habits along the way			0
not everything he does comes off , but that ’s the life of a luxury player			0
you lose the ball , you start the cycle all over again until you win it back			0
leading the line : @entity2 in action with @entity19 's @entity135 @entity98 is growing into his role , driving his team forward with those runs when the ball seems to bobble off his knees , shins and his boots			1
somehow he remains in possession			0
it seems too soon to pin our hopes on the development of this little fella , but that ’s what it has come down to			0
he looks our best bet			0
@entity98 seems unfazed by everything around him , happy to receive the ball in any position on the field			0
in possession , there is an air of expectancy			0
when he is on the ball he makes you want to believe , as he did when he latched on to @entity73 ’s pass inside the area in the second half			0
on the run : @entity73 is stopped in his tracks by @entity167 @entity2 eased off his marker at the back post and arrived in time to put @entity9 ahead			1
the work on this trio continue when they meet up again next month for the @entity173 and @entity174 , but the signs are encouraging			0
@entity2 will be a little frustrated with his failure to find @entity73 or @entity98 after he mugged @entity19 left - back @entity135 in the first half			1
he should have found one of them , but his final ball let him down			0
still , the bigger picture is his goalscoring contribution			0
relief : @entity2 is mobbed by his @entity9 team - mates after bagging the opener his second came in injury time , an emphatic finish beyond @entity190 underlined a fairly impressive @entity9 performance			1
in a couple of days ’ time van @entity1 will attempt to explain why he elected to sell @entity2 to @entity13 on deadline day			1
like @entity2 ’s performance for @entity9 , it will make compulsive viewing			2
centre stage : @entity2 flourished through the middle for @entity9 @entity201 @entity9 players stepped up - @entity202			1

@entity2 gave three lions the lead just before the hour mark in @entity26
striker wrapped up *victory* with his second in stoppage - time to seal points
@entity2 's brace comes seven days after his £ 16m move to @entity215
@entity13 chief executive @entity45 watched @entity2 from the stands
@entity1 's decision to sell striker now looks like a *massive* mistake
