a grandmother on disability benefits was pulled before the courts on fraud charges after she was accidentally overpaid £ 30,000 - because officials could n't read the handwriting of a doctor who examined her			1
driving test examiner @entity7 , 57 , had been seen by a consultant after being forced off work with a debilitating arterial disease which required surgery on her legs			1
but the senior medic ’s scribbled report was so illegible , civil servants at the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) who tried to read it mistakenly believed mrs @entity7 was entitled to the highest level of mobility and carer payments and waved through £ 500 per month in welfare handouts			1
last week mrs @entity7 , from @entity36 , @entity35 was due to face court on benefit fraud charges but the case was thrown out by a judge after civil servants admitted they had sanctioned the payments after misreading the doctor ’s report			1
today she told how she had endured a ‘ living hell ’ since her house was raided by police in june last year			2
she had been suspended from work for 15 months whilst the case was investigated			2
her peripheral vascular disease is now so severe her leg problems have become inoperable while the case has gone through the courts			2
' i could have been sent to jail simply because someone could n’t read a doctor ’s handwriting , ' she said			2
' i just assumed i was getting the right amount because the doctor filed his report and you trust a doctor ’s opinion			2
' it ’s been horrendous and a 16 - month living hell - but it seems the @entity15 do n’t care that my reputation has been completely tarnished			1
they made me feel like a criminal and it was awful			0
' the bottom line is it was the @entity15 that should be blamed for giving me the money			1
i did n’t know the criteria for how much i would get - it was all in the consultant ’s report and for whatever reason the @entity15 could n’t read it			1
' pictured are mrs @entity7 's swollen legs during a 2009 holiday			1
she suffered from a debilitating arterial disease which required surgery @entity84 's case was processed under a now outdated benefit scheme called the @entity86			2
the allowance , which was devised for adults aged 16 to 65 , could be claimed by those suffering from disabilities which affected their day - to - day lives			0
criteria for receiving the allowance was based on the disability 's effects on the individual 's life , rather than the type of condition or its symptoms			0
under this system , which continues to be slowly phased out , benefits were often granted as indefinite			1
in many cases the recipients ' conditions improved to a point where the benefit was no longer necessary - but the lack of subsequent case reviews meant they continued receiving money			0
a new scheme has since been introduced to try and provide better scrutiny around disability benefits			2
known as the @entity113 , to be granted benefits under this scheme a more objective assessment with the prospective recipient takes place which requires a face - to - face consultation with a medical professional			2
the scheme also includes regular individual case reviews so if an individual 's condition worsens or improves the amount of money they receive can be reassessed			0
the roll - out of the @entity113 began across wider @entity127 in june last year			0
mrs @entity7 , a blue badge holder , had initially been twice turned down for @entity86 but applied for a third time in october 2008 when a further operation on her leg left her unable to walk more than 100 yards unaided			1
she went to see the consultant who assessed her mobility and then filed his handwritten report with his recommendations to the @entity15 to help them decide how much benefit mrs @entity7 was entitled to			1
later she was able to return to work full - time but was able to continue claiming the benefits as benefits staff left them open - ended , rather than subject to a yearly review - a service usually reserved for those who have lost a limb or are confined to wheelchairs			1
after the @entity15 were alerted , investigators began filming her as she worked at driving test centres in @entity149 , @entity150 and as far as @entity151			1
in all she received £ 29,303 in @entity86			2
mrs @entity7 added : ' i initially applied for @entity86 because i thought i might be entitled to it			1
i applied for the right for mobility and the girl from the @entity15 phoned me and said " i do n’t think you are claiming enough "			1
she asked a couple of questions and said " leave it with me " and i got it at the highest rate			0
mrs @entity7 ( pictured ) mistakenly received a total of £ 29,303 in disability payments ' i had been refused benefits altogether before			1
they refused and i asked for a review and they refused it again			0
then i had my third major operation so i decided to apply again			0
i applied and they gave me it at the highest rate			0
as it ’s off the consultant ’s report i thought i must be even worse than i think i am			1
' they gave me it for an indefinite period but i did n’t think anything was the matter			2
the benefit claim was awarded on the premise these people knew what they were doing but apparently i ’m supposed to be psychic			0
i never saw any reason to question the doctor ’s report and had no correspondence with the @entity15 regarding my benefits apart from her annual statement			1
' i said i did n’t need any care and the consultant even put self - care is okay on the report , yet the @entity15 said i was entitled to care payments and i had no reason to question it			1
' everyone at work knew i was on benefits			1
it was n’t a secret			0
i explained what i had been through			0
why would i hide it ? it was legitimate as far as i was concerned			0
' they had been filming me at work to try and prove i could do more than i claimed			2
i had said i could n’t walk more than 100 yards and that was always the case			0
i used to come down the stairs and out to the car - about 20 yards			0
they filmed me for five or six months all over the country to try and gather some evidence			1
i did n’t have a clue this was going on			0
' what ’s really frightening is that when they arrested me they put me in the police station and searched my house , took my laptop and phone and got me in a room with just the duty solicitor and it was very intimidating			0
' they were saying i was fraudulent from the off , which i never was			0
that night i could have said " it ’s fair , you have me " , because they frighten you so much			0
' it ’s got to be the @entity15 who are to blame			1
they are saying i should never have had benefits but they could n’t prosecute me because it was their error			2
i would n’t wish this on anyone			0
innocent until proven guilty ? that ’s how i feel			0
in the police station everyone treated you as guilty right from the off			0
i do n’t know where innocent until proven guilty comes from			0
' at @entity149 magistrates court , 18 driving test centre managers from all parts of the @entity127 were due to testify against mrs @entity7			1
but when doubt was raised about the way her claim had been handled by the government , the prosecution offered no further evidence and the case was dismissed by district judge @entity254			1
mrs @entity7 now faces a tribunal on october 7 to see if the @entity15 will pursue their case further and make her repay the money			1
a @entity258 said : ' this case relates to the old system of @entity86 which is an outdated benefit with many claimants on indefinite awards without systematic on - going checks			2
' that is why we have introduced the new @entity113 with a face to face assessment and regular reviews			0
this is to ensure the benefit is more objective and support better targeted at those who need it most			0

@entity7 was seen by consultant after *undergoing* surgery on her legs
but the report was so illegible @entity15 civil servants could not read it correctly
they then mistakenly waved through £ 500 per month in indefinite benefits
it went unnoticed for five years , after which an investigation was *launched*
mrs @entity7 was *monitored* and filmed at work to build evidence against her
but a judge threw out fraud charges after the officials ' blunder was revealed
