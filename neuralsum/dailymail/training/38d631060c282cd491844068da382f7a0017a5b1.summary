by @entity0 for @entity1 follow @ @ gedbrand10 @entity5 , once the next darling of @entity4 football , has admitted he was wrong to join @entity6 in 2010 , but is happy with his career again at @entity8 and intends to see out the remainder of his career at @entity11			2
@entity5 returned to his boyhood club for a second spell in january , after two - and - a - half forgettable years at @entity14			1
and - in an interview with @entity17 fanzine cfcuk - he concedes that he made a mistake in heading for @entity19 as a free agent after seeing his contract run down at @entity17			0
off and running : @entity5 has made an impact for @entity8 since joining in january @entity5 admitted he never adapted to life at @entity6 , and says he was given no choice but to make a move as he could not bring himself to turn out for @entity26 , who offered him a five - year deal in the summer of 2011			1
' i can only play for teams that i ’m passionate about and i think that ’s what went wrong for me at @entity6 , ' said the 31 - year - old midfielder			1
' i did n’t feel a connection with the club or the place that i had at @entity17 and @entity8			0
' i had seven great years at @entity17 but the club wanted to go in a certain direction and i was n’t involved			0
so i was left with two real options - @entity6 or @entity26			2
decline : @entity5 was once tipped to be an @entity39 star , but his last game for his country came in 2010 ' @entity26 was probably the best option because they were offering me a five - year deal and it meant i could stay in familiar surroundings			1
' but i just could n’t do it , i just could n’t see myself pulling that @entity26 shirt over my head			0
with the rivalry between @entity26 and @entity8 and @entity17 , it felt a bit mercenary			2
@entity5 appeared in just 26 league games for @entity6 , and was loaned out to @entity54 side @entity53 in an attempt to regain his form			0
but the 31 - year - old , who has not played for @entity39 since 2010 , has found his feet at @entity8 under @entity59			1
pain stake : @entity5 admitted his risky move to @entity6 did not pay off			0
