by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 05:52 est , 16 august 2013 updated : 05:56 est , 16 august 2013 @entity3 bosses will not be investigated by police over claims the law was broken when huge pay - offs were given to senior managers			1
the @entity9 said there was ' insufficient evidence of dishonesty or criminal misconduct to begin a criminal investigation '			1
it comes after the @entity16 called in external auditors to widen the search for excessive severance payoffs made to its senior executives			1
questions : the @entity3 is under pressure over the scale of severance payments to senior managers director general @entity27 ordered @entity28 to look at deals made to departing staff prior to 2010 to get to the bottom of the severance pay scandal			1
the @entity33 is also investigating the files of 90 senior managers handed golden goodbyes in the past three years to see if they breached contractual limits			1
but the controversial pay - outs will not be the subject of a criminal investigation , @entity38 said			1
conservative mp @entity42 last month called on the @entity9 to investigate allegations of fraud and misconduct in public office			1
the @entity48 mp asked officers to examine the merits of a wider investigation ‘ as to the possibility of fraud , collusion in fraud , misuse of public funds , or other wrongdoing in relation to severance payments at the @entity3 in recent years ’			1
in response @entity38 said it was ' gathering information ' on cases to see if the law had been broken			1
but today a spokesman said : ' the @entity9 received allegations of misconduct in a public office and fraud in relation to severance payments and wider benefits for senior @entity3 managers			1
' these allegations have been carefully assessed by officers from the @entity75 , specialist , organised and @entity77			2
' the assessment , of available material , has concluded there is insufficient evidence of dishonesty or criminal misconduct to begin a criminal investigation , and the @entity9 will not be taking any further action			1
' police : assistant commissioner @entity87 told @entity88 mp @entity42 that fraud squad officers were gathering evidence covering @entity3 pay - offs , but now @entity38 says it has found insufficient evidence to launch a criminal probe the @entity33 's first report identified one case where a @entity3 executive was paid £ 300,000 in lieu of notice after their redundancy was agreed - despite serving their notice in full			1
the payment , equivalent to the cost of 2,062 licence fees - was agreed by then director - general @entity104 , and the unnamed figure ’s redundancy was paid even though they had found a new job			2
the report also highlighted the case of former @entity112 controller @entity111 , who was given a £ 375,000 pay - off but returned the money last month after learning it had not been properly authorised			2
its devastating report found the @entity3 handed its staff £ 369million over eight years , but only looked in detail at the most recent cases			2
the @entity28 review means even more high - profile deals could come under scrutiny , including a £ 500,000 payoff to former @entity126 controller @entity125 in 2007			0
he resigned in disgrace after he was criticised for making false claims about doctored footage of the @entity131			0
@entity27 has already asked for a ‘ detailed briefing ’ into his payoff , although the @entity3 has not yet confirmed whether it will publish what he is told			2
another historic payoff likely to come under the spotlight is a six - figure sum handed to @entity138 , a former controller of @entity139 who resigned over the ‘ @entity143 ’ scandal involving @entity141 and @entity142			0
many @entity3 staff on lower salaries are understood to be furious at the high severance payments			1
in his email to staff earlier this month , @entity27 tried to boost morale , saying : ‘ i know this issue has provoked a very strong reaction from many of you and i understand why you feel that way			0
' it is worth saying however that severance pay in general was part of an attempt to reduce senior management numbers , and in the process we did save £ 35m which went back into programme - making and will continue to do so at a rate of £ 19m a year as we move forwards			2
‘ however , it is clear this was not done in accordance with best practice – that is why we have already tightened up procedures and also why we will not contemplate this level of payoff in the future , even though senior posts will continue to decline in number			0
’ a @entity3 spokesman would not comment on which specific deals @entity28 is likely to look at			0
findings will be published on september 9			0
but this week it emerged @entity28 has spent thousands of pounds wining and dining some of the executives responsible for the most controversial payoffs			0
