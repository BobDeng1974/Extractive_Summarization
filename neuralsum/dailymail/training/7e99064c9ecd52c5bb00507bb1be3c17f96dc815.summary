the 16 - year - old girl said she was too ‘ upset , hurt and angry ’ to go back to @entity4 after it refused to allow her to wear a niqab a @entity6 teenager who was banned from taking a-levels at a leading comprehensive because she started to wear a niqab has moved schools			1
the unnamed 16 - year - old said she was too ‘ upset , hurt and angry ’ to go back to @entity4 after it refused to allow her to wear the full @entity13 veil which only reveals her eyes			1
the girl reportedly left the north @entity17 state school in tears after being told she could not wear the niqab and then decided to move to one that allows it			1
last night , an online petition had gathered more than 1,000 signatures demanding that ‘ @entity24 ’ at the school stop and that she be allowed to wear the veil			1
the school is rated ‘ outstanding ’ by @entity27 and alumnae include @entity30 ’s wife @entity29 , actress @entity31 and former spice girl @entity32			1
it has no uniform and is famous for a liberal approach to education , but it said the niqab contravened its ‘ appearance policy ’			1
the girl , who has attended @entity40 for the past five years and took her gcses there , yesterday said the niqab was not ‘ un-british ’			0
‘ i was born in @entity45			0
i know perfect @entity46 , i enjoy doing the normal , typical things like drinking tea and eating biscuits , ’ she told the @entity44			0
‘ @entity45 claims to be multicultural , meaning they accept different kinds of people			0
’ she added : ‘ i feel if people knew how friendly and social we are , they would n’t say it ’s un-british			0
’ the girl said the school told her that dress ‘ which does not allow teacher - student interactions ’ was against its rules			2
‘ the school has no uniform and i thought they were accepting and open - minded , ’ she said			0
‘ to be honest a lot of people at the school wear inappropriate clothing … very provocative and revealing clothing like extremely short shorts – so it did n’t make sense that they were refusing me to wear the niqab			2
’ she will now study for her a-levels at a different sixth - form college , even though it takes her up to an hour to get there every day			0
in support of the girl , an anonymous protester started a petition on change.org , which says : ‘ [ @entity4 ] is renowned for its individuality and strong feminist views			1
@entity4 ( pictured ) claimed its ' appearance policy ' was ‘ educational ’ and said in a statement : ' inappropriate dress which offends public decency or which does not allow interactions will be challenged ' ' however , this poorly thought out decision made by the school contradicts this			1
what happened to freedom of expression ? ’ the girl ’s sister told the @entity103 the school ’s ruling had been ‘ very upsetting ’ , adding : ‘ my sister just wants to wear the niqab for her own reasons … i do n’t feel like her education should be compromised or the way she dresses should affect the way anyone looks at her			1
’ @entity109 , a former pupil , said ‘ discriminating ’ against those who want to wear the veil was ‘ utterly disgusting ’			0
yesterday , @entity4 claimed the policy was ‘ educational ’ , saying : ‘ interactions between students and teachers take place in a number of ways , but one of the most important is through reading facial expression			2
’ in a statement , it added : ‘ inappropriate dress which offends public decency or which does not allow teacher - student interactions will be challenged			0
’ the school is thought to be the first to have imposed a bar on the niqab since @entity126 was forced to overturn a ban last september , following a petition signed by 9,000 people			2
under @entity131 guidance issued in 2007 schools can set their own uniform policies and enforce such a ban on security , safety or learning grounds			0
a landmark case at the @entity140 that year rejected a @entity143 pupil ’s claim that she should be allowed to wear the niqab in classes .			2
