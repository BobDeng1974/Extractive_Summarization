donor cartilage can be used to help delay or even prevent knee arthritis and the need for a joint replacement			1
@entity5 , 34 , a physiotherapist from @entity6 , underwent the surgery , as she tells @entity8			1
the patient as a teenager , i lived for sport			2
but my dreams of playing volleyball for @entity15 were wrecked after i twisted my left knee during team trials when i was 14			1
an mri scan revealed i had ruptured my anterior cruciate ligament , which joins two bones in the knee together			1
@entity5 could barely walk a couple of hundred yards and was starting to limp i 'd also torn my medial meniscus , a disc of rubbery cartilage on the inner side of my knee , which cushions your knee bones when you bend and straighten your leg			1
i had surgery to reconstruct my torn ligament and the torn meniscal cartilage was sewn back together			1
however , it did n't knit together properly and my knee kept swelling up afterwards			1
so three months later , i had an arthroscopy , where the surgeon uses a telescope with a camera at the end to examine inside the joint , then repairs or removes damaged tissue			1
he took out some of my torn meniscus during the procedure			1
then because bits of it still kept breaking off , i had a second arthroscopy in 2001 to remove the rest			2
this seemed to work well , and in my 20s i was running regularly and playing beach volleyball			2
but five years ago , my left leg started to become very swollen and painful after exercise			1
eventually , i had to give up sport altogether			2
i could barely walk a couple of hundred yards and was starting to limp			1
i was miserable because it was such a huge part of my life			2
i even thought about having my leg amputated and being fitted with an artificial limb - i knew people with artificial limbs who were taking part in marathons			0
at 30 , she felt like an old , disabled woman i was only 30 , but i felt like an old , disabled woman			1
i was planning to marry my fiance , @entity69 , a semi-professional rugby player , and was frightened i would n't be able to keep up with him			1
in september 2010 , my gp referred me to an orthopaedic surgeon , who suggested a meniscal transplant as my knee had started to become arthritic			1
i 'd not heard of this procedure before , but he said i 'd be given a new meniscus donated by someone who had died			0
i had to wait six months for a donor as it had to be the correct size and come from someone a similar age			0
it would come from the @entity85 because this is a relatively new procedure and the tissue available in @entity88 is limited			0
it arrived two weeks before i got married in june 2011			0
i had the operation on june 28 at the @entity91 in @entity92 , near @entity6 , ten days after my wedding			1
the procedure took four hours			0
afterwards , the pain was horrendous			0
i was given the pain - killing drug co-dydramol plus anti-inflammatories , which helped			0
the next day , though still in pain , i was out of bed on crutches			0
i also had to wear a leg brace for eight weeks to stop me from bending my knee too much			2
on the fourth day , i went home and after six weeks i no longer needed painkillers			0
after nine months , i could walk more than a mile pain - free - now it 's five or six miles and i 've also started to play a little volleyball again			2
i 'm so grateful to the person who donated the meniscus			0
the surgeon @entity110 is an orthopaedic surgeon at the @entity111 and @entity112 in @entity92			1
orthopaedic surgeons now recognise that if you replace a damaged meniscus you can delay knee arthritis - and in some cases prevent it altogether			1
this is because when your meniscus is damaged , it puts pressure on the rest of the knee and you end up needing a joint replacement			2
the meniscus is a crescent - shaped cushion of rubbery , fibrous tissue that sits on either side of your knee joint			2
it acts as a shock absorber and allows knee bones to glide smoothly over each other			2
if it gets damaged , bone starts to rub on bone and you can go on to develop arthritis			0
tears to the meniscus are common after a fall or any twisting injury			0
it also loses elasticity through wear and tear as we age			0
a meniscal transplant is best done before the surfaces of the joint have become too damaged			1
for this reason , it is most suitable for people with the signs of early arthritis - usually the under 50s			0
in the @entity85 , surgeons carry out the procedure well before the onset of arthritis and this is proving very successful			0
we also have 20 years of data from @entity162 showing that it has a 90 per cent - plus success rate			0
only 100 to 200 operations are done in the @entity88 each year , but we 're now in a position where we can start conducting our own studies			0
i 'm hopeful that by the end of this decade a meniscal transplant will have become a standard procedure			1
@entity5 had the meniscus on the inside of her left knee removed some time ago			1
she was hobbling around in a lot of pain and showing early signs of osteoarthritis			0
without a new meniscus , her symptoms would have worsened rapidly			0
the first thing we to do is ensure we get a good size - match from a donor			0
this is critical because a meniscus ca n't be stretched or squashed to fit and cutting damages it so it wo n't work as well			2
to gauge the size needed , we use an x-ray machine that incorporates a measuring device to look inside the knee			2
after nine months , @entity5 could walk more than a mile pain - free - now it 's five or six miles the donated meniscus looks rather like a horseshoe , and at either end it has tiny natural anchors of stronger tissue			1
it is these that keep it firmly fixed to the patient 's bone and stop it sliding around			0
using a camera to guide me , i implanted @entity5 's new meniscus in a keyhole procedure under general anaesthetic			1
i made four tiny ( 0.5cm ) keyhole incisions and two longer 6cm incisions over the front of her knee			2
with a motorised device that looks rather like a pen but acts like a mini-vacuum , i removed the last remaining bits of @entity5 's own meniscus			1
then i drilled two tiny tunnels into the top of her shin bone , ( the tibia ) and pulled the meniscal anchors through these and stitched them in place at the front of her knee			1
after stitching up all the incisions , i injected lots of local anaesthetic around the area to help with the pain			0
@entity5 's transplant has made a huge difference - her chances of ever needing a full knee replacement will have been delayed by at least 15 years			1
@entity235 ? the greatest risk associated with this kind of surgery is that it will fail and need to be redone			2
it is estimated this occurs in 5 to 10 per cent of cases			0
there is a very tiny risk of disease , however because donated meniscus discs are all screened for diseases such as hepatitis and @entity249 , the risk is less than with a blood transfusion , says @entity251 , consultant orthopaedic surgeon at the @entity252 in @entity253 and the @entity254 in @entity253			1
rejection of a donor meniscus is rare as there are too few cells in the tissue to excite a response			0
' the reason so few are carried out in the @entity88 is that it is a challenging procedure , so surgeons need to put in the time in order to acquire the expertise , ' adds mr @entity110			0
' but it can no longer be regarded as experimental and when undertaken makes a massive difference to people 's lives			0
' meniscal transplant surgery is available on the @entity271 and privately			1
it costs around Â£ 9,000 .			0
