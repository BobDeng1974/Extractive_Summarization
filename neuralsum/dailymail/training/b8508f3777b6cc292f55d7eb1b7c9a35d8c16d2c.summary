desperate to reduce his chest , mr @entity0 went on a strict diet - causing his weight to plummet to a dangerous nine stone when he was still at school - but it only made his chest more prominent			1
but after years of torment , he finally decided to sell his car to fund a £ 2,000 breast reduction - and is hoping his new chest will help him find love			1
mr @entity0 said : ' my moobs stuck out so much the kids called me names for the duration of high school			1
' i had n't taken my top off in public since primary school and never went topless in the house so my mum did n't even know			2
' whenever we went on holiday i always wore a t - shirt in the pool - i just told people i burnt easily to shut them up			2
' i tried everything to make them disappear but when i lost weight it just made them stand out more			1
' in the end i put weight on to cover up the disparity between my chest and stomach			2
' in an attempt to hide his embarrassment , he always wore a school jumper one size too big even if the summer sun was blazing			0
even after school , his confidence was knocked and his love life took a knock , meaning he has n't had a girlfriend since he was 13			2
mr @entity0 said : ' it 's hard to get close to somebody when you have this hang up			2
' it 's difficult to keep seeing someone when you 're constantly thinking " i 've got bigger boobs than you "			0
' excessive development of male breasts — also known as gynaecomastia — is thought to affect 40 per cent of men and it seems the proportion is rising			2
high - profile sufferers include @entity94 and @entity95			0
the condition can be provoked by an imbalance of the sex hormones oestrogen and testosterone			0
it can also be triggered by certain medication like antidepressants , heart and liver pills , some cancer drugs and illegal drugs like cannabis and anabolic steroids			0
he now has to wear a compression vest but says he already feels like ' a completely different person ' mr @entity0 's lowest point came when his previous boss mentioned he looked a bit ' mooby '			1
after that , he began to look in to surgical options			0
three years later , the 19 - year - old decided to go under the knife and had 200ml of fat and glandular tissue removed from each breast			1
the teenager sold his pride and joy - a 2003 @entity125 - to pay £ 1,750 for breast reduction and nipple inversion in @entity128 through @entity129			1
to aid the recovery process he must wear a compression vest , but says he already feels like a completely different person			1

' i looked into it and it 's about £ 5,000 over here			0
' with @entity129 they talked me through everything and even let me speak to previous patients , it really put my mind at ease			0
' @entity150 , the surgeon who performed mr @entity0 's operation , said : ' i am extremely pleased with the results of @entity0 's surgery and i am looking forward to seeing him in one of our @entity156 aftercare clinics			1
' it 's essential to remove glandular tissue as well as fat to stop the problem returning in a couple of years			1
' @entity163 ( sometimes referred to as ' man boobs ' , or moobs , is a common condition that causes boys ’ and men ’s breasts to swell and become larger than normal			1
it is most common in teenage boys and older men			0
it can be caused by an imbalance between the sex hormones testosterone and oestrogen			0
oestrogen causes breast tissue to grow			2
while all men produce some oestrogen , they usually have much higher levels of testosterone , which stops the oestrogen from causing breast tissue to grow			1
if the balance of hormones in his body changes , this can cause a man ’s breasts to grow			2
sometimes , the cause of this imbalance is unknown			0
the growth in breast tissue is not due to extra body fat from being overweight , so losing weight or doing more exercise will not improve the condition			1
during puberty , boys ’ hormone levels vary			0
if the level of testosterone drops , oestrogen can cause breast tissue to grow			2
many teenage boys have some degree of breast enlargement			0
as men get older , they produce less testosterone			0
also , older men tend to have more body fat , and this can cause more oestrogen to be produced			0
these changes in hormone levels can lead to excess breast tissue growth			1
