there were no apologies from @entity2 for claiming to be greater than @entity3			1
there was reverence for @entity6 , even though @entity7 believes the @entity8 is in his corner			1
there was an emotional remembrance of the frail old gentleman back in his tough birth - place of @entity14 , @entity15 who was his surrogate grandfather			1
@entity2 is preparing to face @entity7 at the @entity17 on may 2 in @entity18 @entity2 has defended his announcement that he feels he is @entity20 ahead of the mega-fight @entity2 built a reputation on being brash and flash but was soft - spoken during his conference call there was sympathy for @entity27 in his battle with @entity29 ' even though @entity7 's trainer has been trash - talking his claim to be @entity32			1
there were even soft - spoken words of thanks for we 200 hacks on the conference call for helping sell the half - billion - dollar richest fight of all time			1
goodbye to the brash , flash , bombastic @entity41			2
well , more or less			2
hello to the mature mr @entity2 who weighs his words carefully and respects one and all			1
he has been slammed for pronouncing himself superior to @entity3 so he said : ' i respect all the great champions of the past			1
but i 've done just as much as @entity3 did			1
' he was champion at heavyweight but i 've won world titles in five divisions			2
he fought for a helluva cause ( @entity52 ) but i 'm still sharp at age 38			2
still going strong at age 38			2
' he lost , once to man who 'd only had seven fights previously			2
he called himself @entity56 so i call myself @entity32			1
i knew there would be a back - lash but i could n't care less			1
' he said he was greater than @entity58 and someone else will come along in the future to be criticised for believing he 's the best			1
' the @entity6 question did not faze him : ' i also believe in @entity6			2
i 've been blessed in my life			2
i love @entity6 and i do n't believe @entity6 takes sides ( in fights )			2
we are all @entity6 's children and i do n't think he roots for which of us he wants to win			2
' @entity67 is down on count two after being struck by @entity3 's killer right - hander in 1974 @entity3 looks on after he knocked @entity67 to the canvas with the holy mother of all right - handers during the bout @entity3 called himself @entity56 and the @entity75 was voted the best sporting event of the century @entity27 has characterised the fight as ' good against evil ' but the barbs have not rattled @entity2 : ' i 'm not going to say anything negative about @entity27			1
not against someone who 's not 100 per cent healthy			2
he 's entitled to say what he wants to say			2
it 's better for me to say nothing at all			0
' his fighter is not talking like that and it 's only me and @entity7 who will do the fighting			1
' the new , considerate @entity2 choked up a little when asked about important influences who had inspired him to greatness			1
he took us back to @entity14 and a certain mr @entity95 , saying : ' he was important to me from the age of three , like a grandfather			0
he would drive me to fights in my amateur days ( no money back then )			1
he believed in me more than anyone			0
he told me i 'd make it			0
he took me to church			0
' he came to so many of my fights right up to @entity104			0
but he 's not doing well now			0
he 's in an old folks home			0
he 's losing his memory			0
i love the guy so much			0
i think about him every day			0
' it went quiet for a moment on the line			0
it seemed like a good time to ask why he had changed from cocksure to contemplative almost to the point of silence			1
@entity2 slips a punch from @entity104 in the eighth round at the @entity17 on may 5 , 2007 @entity2 poses with the @entity122 super welterweight belt after beating @entity104 by split decision in 2007 ' i had to be loud to get where we are today , ' he said			1
' at 17 or 18 i was saying look at me			0
the big personality was part of that game plan			0
to get to this point we 're at now			0
making seven figures in one night			0
and as you get older you mature			0
' and he welcomes the challenge which some think threatens his unbeaten legacy : ' i respect @entity7			1
to be here now he must be doing something right			0
' we reached the point where this fight had to happen			0
he 's one of the last great fighters of our time left for me to defeat			1
i 'm glad it 's happening			0
' he goes back again to a moment in his youth : ' when i was 17 or 18 @entity148 had come out of prison			0
i went to the @entity150 to watch him fight			0
busy ? i thought , man , we 'll never see the @entity17 this packed ever again			0
@entity7 says he will have to be a warrior against @entity2 but is convinced he will win @entity7 works out at a park in @entity155 , @entity156 , ahead of his $ 300million mega-fight on may 2 @entity7 is joined by supporters during training as he jogs along a city street to a park in @entity155 ' but then i started to believe i could do record numbers one day and now me and my team are making it happen			1
' two days earlier @entity7 had time for only two words at his conference call before his promoter @entity167 hung up the phone in frustration at some questions he deemed banal			1
@entity2 gave us about half - an - hour of insights which , at the end , came down to these six words of blinding simplicity : ' my game plan is to win			1
