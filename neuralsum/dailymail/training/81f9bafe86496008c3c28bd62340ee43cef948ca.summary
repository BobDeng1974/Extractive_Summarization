published : 15:03 est , 2 march 2014 updated : 07:06 est , 3 march 2014 more than 100 @entity2 executives are earning six - figure salaries , despite pledges to curb top pay and offer viewers better value for money , new figures have revealed that more than 100 of the corporation 's top earners make at least £ 100,000 a year , and 80 of them are on salaries of £ 150,000 or more			1
according to an official @entity2 register of elite staff , 13 executives were also given a pay rise of up to 10 per cent , at a time when the broadcaster is facing cuts to its spending			1
value for money : since lord @entity24 took over the post of @entity2 director general in april last year he has been trying to cut the percentage of executives from 2.5 per cent of the workforce to one per cent it also follows last year 's severance pay scandal in which the @entity32 found that the @entity2 handed over £ 1.4million more in pay - offs to senior managers than it needed to			1
since @entity24 took over the post of director general in april last year he has been trying to cut the percentage of executives from 2.5 per cent of the workforce to one per cent			1
and although more than 25 senior managers have left the broadcaster since his tenure began , the number of serving managers required to declare their income as more than £ 100,000 has risen from 100 to 102 , according to the @entity44			2
the @entity2 said that the loss of these 25 senior figures had led to savings to the pay bill of more than £ 2million between march 31 , 2013 , and january 1 of this year , and that the number of senior management earners had also fallen by two per cent			2
since taking over as director general , @entity24 has been keen to argue that the @entity2 provides value for money and in a speech to the @entity55 last week he said a @entity2 survey had shown that some viewers would happily pay between £ 15 and £ 20 a month , compared to the £ 12 currently paid			1
cost : @entity24 has suggested that viewers who watch @entity2 programmes through the @entity61 catch - up service should be forced to pay the £ 145.50 annual licence fee he also accepted the @entity2 needs to cut the amount it spends and refused to rule out making cuts to some channels such as @entity2 or @entity66 , as well as suggesting that viewers who watch @entity2 programmes through the @entity61 catch - up service should be forced to pay the £ 145.50 annual licence fee , which currently only applies to those who watch shows as they are broadcast			1
and in the wake of the severance pay scandal last year , he called for the corporation to be run like an employee - owned organisation such as @entity73 rather than a bank seeking to maximise shareholder profits			2
he said : ‘ the @entity2 is not a standard public service			0
in ethos we ’re less like the @entity79 and more like @entity73 ... we are the @entity2 , not a plc. ’ director general @entity24 £ 450,000 - a - year ( a decrease of £ 221,000 compared with @entity83 but the same as @entity84 ) managing director , finance and operations @entity88 £ 395,000 ( £ 43,000 more than former chief financial officer @entity89 ) director of news and current affairs @entity93 £ 340,000 ( the same as his predacessor @entity95 ) director , television @entity97 £ 320,000 ( £ 50,000 more than @entity84 's basic salary as director of vision in 2011/12			1
mr @entity97 did not receive a pay increase on his promotion from controller of @entity105 ) source : @entity2 / @entity44 in march 2013 the number of managers required to declare their pay stood at 103 , which has now risen to 111 , plus four non-executive directors			0
once recently departed staff and non-executive directors are removed from the tally , the figure has risen from 100 to 102 , according to the @entity44 - although the @entity2 refute this			0
staff remain on the list for one quarter after their departure			0
some 87 of them have a salary higher than that of prime minister @entity125 's £ 142,500 - a - year pay , and 82 are on more than £ 150,000 - a - year			2
' the website referenced still contains profiles of a number of individuals who have left the organisation and simply counting them does n't deliver up to date numbers - the latest figures show senior manager numbers have reduced under @entity24 by more than 25 people , reducing the pay bill by more than £ 2m , ' a @entity2 spokesman told @entity137			1
' it is also factually inaccurate to suggest 100k senior management earners are up under @entity24 - they are also down ( by two per cent )			0
' some senior figures have also received pay rises , despite many in the public sector being subject to a pay freeze			0
chief adviser @entity146 , who is responsible for running the director of television 's executive office currently is recorded as having a salary of £ 109,433 and a total remuneration of £ 114,233 - although that figure from november 2013 has risen nearly £ 10,000 from her june listing			0
and controller of entertainment commissioning @entity154 also declared a pay rise of 10 per cent , giving him a total remuneration of £ 230,000 after taking on some new responsibilities			0
the corporation reportedly needs to reduce this figure to 65 people by the end of 2015 , and the @entity162 has recommended that the senior management salary bill should be reduced by recruiting new figures who are paid less than their predecessors			0
@entity24 himself commands a £ 450,000 - a - year salary , the same as his predecessor @entity84 , who resigned after just 54 days in the job , but less than @entity172 who earned £ 671,000 a year .			2

more than 100 of the @entity2 's top earners make at least £ 100,000 a year
some 13 executives at the corporation given pay rises of up to 10 *%*
