the @entity1 ' top message man said tuesday that his party erred five years ago by putting the @entity4 law ahead of economic priorities			1
at a @entity10 news conference , @entity8 @entity7 sen. @entity6 conceded that the vast majority of @entity12 were relatively happy with their employer - provided health insurance in 2009			1
the health care overhaul 's message , @entity6 explained , was aimed at about 5 per cent of the electorate : those who lacked insurance and who voted			1
' to aim a huge change in mandate at such a small percentage of the electorate made no political sense , ' he said			1
his office later told the @entity39 that he ' expressed those concerns privately to fellow @entity1			0
' @entity6 is now urging the @entity7 to tilt leftward in the wake of crushing midterm election losses , saying ' working @entity12 ' want a robust government that will promote education access , labor bargaining rights , progressive taxes and more			1
his remarks came a few weeks after @entity48 won control of the @entity1 and boosted their @entity51 majority in the midterm elections			0
he said the way back to influence on @entity55 is to appeal to voters who support ' an active and forceful government ' to help them cope with globalization , technology and other forces keeping middle incomes stagnant			0
@entity6 said @entity1 made it easier for @entity48 to paint government as bloated and inept with ' the rollout of the @entity4 exchanges , the mishandling of the surge in border crossers , ineptitude at the @entity70 ( @entity71 ) and the government 's initial handling of the @entity75 threat			1
' @entity6 is one of the @entity76 's most senior and ambitious @entity1			1
he oversaw the party 's campaign efforts in two highly successful elections , 2006 and 2008 , and he now chairs the @entity80			0
some see him as a potential successor to @entity83 @entity34 of @entity84			0
his comments tuesday could upset those who say it was wise to make the health care overhaul the first major legislative initiative after president @entity90 's 2008 election			1
and @entity48 quickly ridiculed his call for a more robust federal government			0
' the failure of big - government liberalism is why liberals were overwhelmingly rebuked at the polls this month , ' said the conservative group @entity97			2
@entity99 reflection : in a 2007 book , @entity6 called for lower taxes and a reduction in the number of illegal immigrants in @entity12 in a lengthy speech tuesday , @entity6 repeatedly said @entity1 must not run away from an active government			2
' the 2014 election was not a repudiation of government in general , ' he said , but ' just another sign of a deep frustration that government is not doing enough to fix our country 's problems			0
' @entity6 said he and other @entity1 will propose specific policies later , but he hinted at several likely areas			2
he called for making college more affordable ; making taxes progressive , or proportionately higher on upper incomes ; spending more on infrastructure such as roads and bridges ; and ' changing labor laws so workers can demand more pay			0
' @entity6 reflected @entity7 divisions over expanded trade agreements			2
he called for ' negotiating good trade policies that prevent jobs from going overseas			0
' he said most voters feel ' trade has hurt wages significantly ' by encouraging imports from low - income countries .			2

@entity8 sen. @entity6 said going all - in on the @entity4 at the beginning on the @entity90 presidency ' made no political sense '
most *people* were happy with their medical insurance already , he said
strategy was to earn *appreciation* from those who were *n't* , and who were likely voters
that group , said @entity6 , was only about 5 per cent of the electorate
