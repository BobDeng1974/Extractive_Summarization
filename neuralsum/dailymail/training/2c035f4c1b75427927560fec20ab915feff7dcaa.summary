they set fire to the @entity6 to cover their tracks			2
but their crimes caught up with them two years later when , after news of the mutiny reached @entity36 , a ship was dispatched to arrest the mutineers			1
after rounding up 14 out of 23 of them , they were imprisoned in a makeshift cell on the deck of @entity84			0

the fascinating 80 - page document , written by lawyer @entity92 , features an appendix containing a ' @entity52 of the @entity53 , the @entity49 of which have hitherto been withheld from the @entity54 ' - which includes @entity29 's written testimony			1
in his written testimony , @entity29 ( left ) said : ' a little before sunrise , @entity96 , who was mate of the ship and officer of the watch , came into my cabin while i was asleep , and seizing me , tied my hands with a cord , assisted by the others who were also in the cabin , all armed with muskets and bayonets			1

following the trial , three of the mutineers were hanged , four were acquitted and three were pardoned			1
the front cover of the document names the defendants and the charge they face			1
it states : ' on a charge of mutiny on the 28th april 1789 , on board his majesty 's ship @entity6 , for running away with the ship , and deserting his majesty 's service ; ' @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity20 , @entity150 and @entity151			1
' the first witness account is the letter written by @entity29			1
he revealed the chilling moment @entity96 seized him and tied him to the mast			0
the 1962 film , @entity157 , starring @entity158 ( left , as @entity96 ) and @entity159 ( centre , as @entity29 ) @entity70 was discovered in in 1767 by the @entity36 and settled by the mutineers in 1790			1
@entity96 and the mutineers put @entity164 's captain @entity29 and many crewmen on a launch which eventually reached @entity167			1
the mutineers first sailed to @entity64 , dropping off 16 of their number			1
there , @entity170 shot @entity172 dead and was himself stoned to death by @entity172 's @entity64 family			1
@entity15 , eight mutineers and 18 @entity176 then set sail to avoid apprehension , landing on @entity70 in 1790			2
the @entity64 - based mutineers were recaptured in 1791			1
three were later executed after a trial			2
in 1793 , the mutineers and the male @entity176 fought a war , that killed all the male @entity176 and four of the mutineers , including @entity14			2
by the time a @entity186 ship visited in 1808 only one mutineer , @entity188 , was still alive , with nine women and some children			2
the population has dropped from 250 in the 1930s to 50			0
it is 3,300 miles away from @entity194 and has no harbour or airstrip			0
visitors must fly to an outlying @entity64 island and then travel by boat for 36 hours to get there			2
many of the men operate the island 's only boats , which are lifelines to the outside world , ferrying in essential supplies			0
it reads : ' a little before sunrise , @entity96 , who was mate of the ship and officer of the watch , came into my cabin while i was asleep , and seizing me , tied my hands with a cord , assisted by the others who were also in the cabin , all armed with muskets and bayonets			0
' i was now threatened with instant death if i spoke a word ... i was forced on deck in my shirt with my hands tied , and secured by a guard abaft the mizzen mast			0
' i now demanded of @entity14 the cause of such a violent act , but no other answer was given but " hold your tongue , sir , or you are dead this instant "			0
' holding me by the cord which tied my hands he often threatened to stab me in the breast with a bayonet he held in his right hand			0
' captain @entity29 then recalled how he was forced to get into the small rowing boat with some of his men			1
the letter continues : ' the boatswain was ordered to hoist the launch out , and while i was kept under a guard with @entity14 at their head abaft the mizzen mast , the officers and men not concerned in the mutiny were ordered into the boat			0
' this being done , i was told by @entity14 , " sir , your officers and men are now in the boat , and you must go with them "			0
' i was at last forced into the boat and we were then veered astern , in all nineteen souls			0
' once adrift , @entity29 made for nearby @entity260 but his problems were far from over			2
two days after he and his party stepped ashore on the tiny island of @entity265 , they were attacked by natives			0
@entity29 's testimony states : ' when the natives discovered we had no fire arms , they attacked with clubs and stones , in the course of which i had the misfortune to lose one very worthy man , @entity276			1
' but getting into our boat was no security , for they followed us in canoes loaded with stones , which they threw with much force and exactness			0
' happily , night saved the rest of us			0
' @entity5 , who was loyal to @entity29 , gave evidence in person at the trial			1
the minutes read : ' i was awaked out of my sleep by a confused noise ; directly after , i thought i heard the fixing of bayonets			0
' i jumped out , and put my trousers on			0
at the door i met mr @entity296 the @entity297 , who told me that the ship was taken from us			0
' mr @entity296 answered , " it is by our own people and mr @entity96 at their head "			0
' when i came upon deck i saw @entity29 , and mr @entity96 standing alongside of him with a naked bayonet			2
' then i went down into the boat ; the sentry saw me down			0
then i believe there was about ten or twelve in the boat			0
' in about four or five minutes after this , the remainder with mr @entity29 came into the boat			2
' mr @entity120 at different times asked @entity29 to cast the boat off , or cast her loose , that he was rather dubious of their firing into us			2
' i can not say the answer that @entity29 made him , but the boat was cast adrift , but by whom i ca n't tell			2
' @entity318 , book specialist at @entity320 , said : ' this document is of great historical significance and it is very rare it should come on the market			0
after having been cast adrift , @entity29 and his crew were hospitably received by the governor of @entity167 ' it is a scarce item that could be seen as the founding stone of the episode involving @entity29 and the mutiny on the @entity6			2
' it is an incident which still captures the imagination and in which there is an enormous interest			0
' this is the official account as it was first told at the time			0
' @entity29 survived the mutiny after navigating his tiny rowing boat 3,600 miles to @entity167 , an island in south - east @entity340 , before returning to @entity36			1
he later faced a court martial himself for the loss of his ship but was acquitted and eventually rose to the rank of @entity345			2
@entity15 and the surviving mutineers stayed on the @entity70 where their descendants live to this day			0
the document , measuring 10in by 7in , is tipped to fetch Â£ 30,000 when it goes under the hammer at @entity320 in @entity352 on june 19			1
the book has been listed for auction by a private seller for reasons unknown			0
it was once owned by @entity358 , 6th @entity359 .			0
