' the privilege is personal ; it can not be used to protect another person ... otherwise , the privilege could be used as a shield to protect a witness ' friends , and to deny a civil litigant probative evidence			0
' a witness may not invoke the @entity87 in order to hide knowledge of a friend 's criminal conduct			1
' after @entity84 disappeared , authorities searched the @entity139 was working at on june 4			0

' plainly and simply , @entity22 's lawsuit is a quest for information to move the criminal investigation forward and to taint any jury pool , ' according to the filing			2
civil allegations require a lower standard of proof — a preponderance of evidence — than criminal charges , which must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt			0
compelling her to testify , @entity244 wrote , could force @entity11 to invoke her constitutional right against self - incrimination , pointing out the weak spots in her case			2
happier times : @entity22 smiles and holds her son on the beach playtime : a family photo shows a smiling @entity84 enjoying the playground ' the burden on @entity11 of being required to participate in this lawsuit before the district attorney and police have completed their investigation squarely jeopardizes her constitutional rights , ' @entity244 wrote			2
