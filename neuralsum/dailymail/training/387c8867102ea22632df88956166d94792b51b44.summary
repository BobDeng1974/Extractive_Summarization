by @entity0 published : 07:33 est , 4 january 2013 updated : 11:27 est , 4 january 2013 he was @entity2 's @entity2 's spymaster , protector and the deeply - @entity5 man bent on crushing all those who supported the @entity7 in @entity8			1
but 500 years on it appears a cunning plot by a subversive @entity12 artist may have been uncovered - because below a priceless portrait of sir @entity14 lies a secret image of the @entity16 holding a baby @entity17			1
the painting , which may also contain a sketch of @entity20 or an angel , is from the 1580s and created at the height of @entity25 's powers , while he served as the @entity29 queen 's lord treasurer and secretary			1
hundreds were burned , hanged or beheaded at the fervent priest - hunter 's say - so , including @entity33 when he uncovered the plot to place her on the @entity36 throne in 1587			1
uncovered : @entity2 's @entity5 enforcer sir @entity14 's portrait has been scanned , which has uncovered a secret sketch put there by a @entity12 sympathiser hidden : running over @entity14 's face is the outline of what appears to be the @entity16 and @entity17 at the time @entity36 was openly backing a war in the @entity47 against enemy @entity48 and sir @entity14 was using his huge network of spies across the country and @entity53 to protect the @entity33 from the threat of @entity8			1
aide : @entity14 was one of @entity2 's right - hand men and also her treasurer and secretary in the 16th century however , a five - year study into @entity29 art by the @entity61 in @entity62 has found an important portrait of him contains hidden images , uncovered after it was hit with infra - red reflectography and x-rays			1
this technique has allowed the images to be seen underneath layers of paint without disturbing the main works ' he would not have been delighted , ' gallery expert dr @entity74 said , adding : ' the @entity5 spymaster with the @entity12 image of the virgin and child beneath , you do wonder if the artist might be enjoying a private joke at the expense of the sitter			2
' the @entity12 are the absolute enemy at this period so the idea that you ’ve got this wonderful devotional image underneath your portrait would probably be rather horrifying to him			1
' there is not very much that @entity25 does not know about of what ’s going on in courts across @entity53 , he has a huge network of informers , is an incredibly wily man and is someone with a public reputation			0
for somebody who is not wonderfully keen on @entity25 this would be a clever way of getting at him			0
' it is intriguing that it is under the spy - master general '			0
@entity14 was not the only victim as a version of @entity106 has been found on the canvas underneath a portrait of @entity109 , the @entity29 statesman and poet			1
the portrait of @entity109 , 1st @entity111 , is dated 1601 , by an unknown artist			2
the underlying image of the flagellation is believed to be based on an engraving of the work , which first appeared on a fresco in the @entity118 in @entity8 by @entity119 after designs by @entity121			2
recycling ? this portrait of poet @entity109 from 1601 was also looked at and it revealed an image of @entity17 below , which could be deliberate or a recycled background message : hidden below @entity128 's picture appears to be an image of @entity106 , after @entity121 , by @entity130 as 120 canvasses were scanned for secret images and only two were found to be hiding something , the gallery says it is likely the pair were targeted			1
he was @entity2 's priest - hunter who dedicated his life to protecting his country as leader of a fervent anti-catholic cause			0
known as a master spy , he infiltrated @entity12 pockets in @entity36 and abroad and built up a huge network of contacts			0
he was famous for using fear and paranoia as a weapon against @entity8 , and anyone suspected of being a threat to the country was killed , without exception			1
at the time there were several perceived threats to the @entity33 's reign , especially from @entity48 , and he killed many to stop it			2
his most famous moment came when he discovered @entity33 was being lined up in a papist plot which led to her being beheaded at @entity160 in 1587			1
there are also other famous examples of artists hiding pictures below artwork			0
@entity167 's painting of a @entity169 general was found under his drawing of @entity172 judge @entity171 at a @entity47 gallery , with experts sure that it was painted over for political reasons			0
and the 16th century @entity178 painting called @entity179 , kept in @entity180 , was x-rayed at a local hospital , which discovered there was a portrait of a man in @entity29 costume holding his own waist			2
some of these secret sketches may also be an example of the artists being thrifty and recycling canvasses or wood to form the piece of art. “ it has been really exciting to discover these images beneath portraits			0
the re-use of wooden panels is an example of @entity202 recycling , which was an essential part of life in the past			0
and yet , the people in the portraits painted over the top were perhaps unlikely to have known the panels were second - hand , ' dr @entity74 said			0
the works go on display this week in an exhibition , hidden : @entity212			0
visitors are also shown the x-ray images alongside copies of the concealed paintings .			0
