with its carefully controlled , stage managed events and blandly repetitive slogans , the election campaign so far has been just a little bit boring			2
but not if you are on @entity7 's tour , where the @entity9 leader has boarded his bright yellow ' fun bus ' for a series of bizarre and unlikely photo opportunities which today saw him try his hand at ten - pin bowling			1
aides say it is part of a deliberate strategy to get the deputy prime minister out of @entity20 to meet normal people as they go about their daily lives			1
and if that means pulling pints , sipping cocktails , hurtling down a zipwire or chatting to @entity27 or a hedgehog with a brain injury , mr @entity7 seems only to happy to oblige			1
while strategists admit they struggle to compete in the ' air war ' as @entity53 and the @entity54 dominate the tv and radio bulletins , they believe mr @entity7 's enthusiasm for getting out and meeting people is paying off			2
on the first day of the election campaign , he rushed from a meeting with the @entity61 at @entity62 to a wildlife sanctuary in @entity64			2
there he was introduced to @entity66 , a hedgehog with a head injury which means he keeps walking round in circles			1
mr @entity7 was told the animals have a lifespan of just five years , which he might be able to relate to as his party faces the prospect of being booted out of government for the first time since 2010			2
@entity7 and @entity9 candidate @entity76 were introduced to @entity66 , a hedgehog with a head injury which means he keeps walking round in circles he took a short break from campaigning to take part in @entity83 near @entity84 on wednesday the deputy prime minister tested the water , but declined to take a dip , during a visit to @entity89 on april 6 mr @entity7 faced a grilling from @entity91 star @entity27 , who seemed a little confused about the @entity9 ’ name since then he has flown down a zipwire at a @entity95 park , tested the water at @entity89 , planted flowers in @entity98 , painted a picture at a nursery in @entity101 and watched racing wheels coming off the production in @entity104			1
food and drink has played a big part in the campaign too , from pulling pints in a @entity111 pub , to sipping cocktails in the sun in @entity114			1
he was even presented with cakes with his own face printed on them during a visit to the marginal seat of @entity119 and @entity120			0
after launching the party 's @entity122 manifesto , he was grilled by @entity91 star @entity27 , who seemed a little confused about the @entity9 ’ name			1
mr @entity7 had to patiently explain that the party was not called ‘ demo - cats ’ , after @entity33 wondered why it had such a ‘ weird ’ name			0
’ ‘ i ’ve been deputy prime minister for the last five years , ’ mr @entity7 added			0
i sort of rule @entity33			0
i was going to say , someone else will be prime minister next ? are you going to be prime minister ? ' the @entity9 leader , currently on around 8 per cent in the polls , had to admit this was unlikely			1
but the pair parted amicable , but not before posing for a selfie			0
the @entity9 leader is touring the country in a bright yellow election battlebus fitted out with a radio studio to allow him to continue his regular broadcasts designed to drum up support before may 7 food and drink has never been far from the campaign , including pulling pint at the @entity147 brasserie in @entity111 , with @entity9 candidate @entity148 looking on when mr @entity7 invited the @entity151 cameras into his home for a profile , he was seen glugging on white wine while wife @entity155 spoke about the pressure of politics on family life mr @entity7 has been seen drinking real lemonade in @entity160 , @entity161 , a @entity162 as he talks in @entity114 and coffee in @entity164 and @entity165 a cupcake featuring the faces of mr @entity7 and @entity168 , the @entity9 candidate in @entity120 and @entity169 a source close to mr @entity7 said : ' @entity7 as a leader of a major political party has always tried to do things differently			1
this election campaign is no different			0
' it 's lively , it 's fun			0
he is interacting with normal people , doing things that they do every day , whether it is ten - pint bowling or going down the pub. ' the key is to get out there and get him talking to people in their ordinary environment			1
' we are lucky to have a leader in @entity7 who is up for doing anything			2
he is not afraid of a bacon sandwich			0
' labour leader @entity192 , who famously struggled to eat a bacon sandwich for the cameras , has been criticised for appearing throughout the election campaign in front of a red @entity53 backdrop			2
it was all child 's play as he tried his hand at painting at the @entity200 in @entity201 near @entity101 he watered and tended some some plants during a visit to the mental health charity @entity205 , in @entity98 on a visit to @entity208 , a specialist manufacturer of high performance racing wheels in @entity104 , @entity161 there were inevitable jokes about the wheels coming off the @entity9 campaign before setting off for an afternoon ten - pin bowling , mr @entity7 used a speech in @entity20 to warn conservative plans to raise billions of pounds from the ' grubby hands of scroungers ' will not work			1
the @entity9 leader promised to ' spread the burden ' of deficit reduction , with cuts to welfare and @entity225 budgets along with tax rises aimed at the very wealthy			1
car tax would rise by £ 25 - a - year			0
but he scaled back his plans for a mansion tax , amid concern it could cost the party support in key seats in affluent parts of @entity20			0
mr @entity7 set out plans for £ 5billion in new tax rises , £ 7billion raised from a crackdown on tax avoidance , £ 12 billion in public spending reductions and a £ 3 billion cut from welfare			0
but he mocked @entity244 's insistence that another £ 12billion can be found from the welfare budget			0
mr @entity7 warned that it was ' quite simply impossible ' to find savings on that scale without causing ' real pain to millions of families ' and some of the most vulnerable people .			0
