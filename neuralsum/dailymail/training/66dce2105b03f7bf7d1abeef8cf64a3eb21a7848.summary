scientists have made a key breakthrough in discovering how the body can destroy cancerous tumours itself			2
researchers from @entity6 have identified a molecule , known as @entity8 , which activates a protein that helps fight the disease			1
the protein , called @entity12 , suppresses tumour development during immune surveillance , the immune system 's process of patrolling the body for cancer cells			1
a key benefit of using @entity12 is that it uses the immune system , so it is not toxic to the body like chemotherapy or radiotherapy ( pictured ) this process is lost during cancer progression , which leads to uncontrolled growth and spread of tumours			1
the key benefit of using @entity12 ( tumour - necrosis - factor - related apoptosis - inducing ligand ) as a way to fight cancer is that it is already part of the immune system so it is not toxic to the body like chemotherapy or radiotherapy			1
furthermore , the small size of @entity37 also makes it more effective than past discoveries because it can cross the blood - brain barrier , which separates the main circulatory system from the brain			0
this barrier can prevent cancer treatments from entering the brain , thereby hindering the action of drugs for brain tumours			0
' we did nâ€™t actually anticipate that this molecule would be able to treat brain tumours - that was a pleasant surprise , ' said lead researcher @entity51 , an oncologist at @entity6			0
another positive is that @entity8 does not just activate the @entity12 gene in cancerous cells , but also in healthy ones			1
this is known as the ' bystander effect ' - i.e. where cells near cancerous cells are also killed			0
nearby healthy cells are also given a boost to increase the number of cancer - killing @entity12 receptors on their cell surface			2
the small size of @entity37 also means it can cross the blood - brain barrier , which many anti-cancer drugs can not do , making it effective at targeting brain cancer cells ( pictured ) although the study was limited to mice , dr @entity51 is confident that a similar approach would work in humans			0
he added : ' i was surprised and impressed that we were able to do this			0
' using a small molecule to significantly boost and overcome limitations of the @entity12 pathway appears to be a promising way to address difficult to treat cancers using a safe mechanism already used in those with a normal effective immune system			1
' the @entity12 pathway is a powerful way to suppress tumors but current approaches have limitations that we have been trying to overcome to unleash an effective and selective cancer therapy , ' he added			2
the success of @entity12 to trigger cancer cell death has led to ongoing clinical trials with artificially created versions , and early trials have shown that giving the protein in drug form is safe			2
the study is published in the journal @entity99 .			0

@entity102 researchers have identified a a molecule , known as @entity8 , which activates protein that helps fight disease
the protein , called @entity12 , helps immune system suppress tumour development
because protein is part of immune system , it is not toxic to the body like chemotherapy or radiotherapy
