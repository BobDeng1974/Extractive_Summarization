revelations : a government investigation has revealed half of all babies terminated for @entity5 's syndrome are not recorded by doctors half of all babies aborted for @entity5 are missing from official figures due to chaotic record - keeping in abortion clinics , a government investigation has revealed			1
doctors have broken the law by failing to keep proper records for the @entity16 on the reason for termination			1
many @entity5 ’s terminations are being wrongly recorded as ‘ social ’ abortions – which make up the bulk of terminations in this country – but other records are simply missing			1
the investigation , published on the @entity16 website , shows that in 2012 a total of 994 babies were aborted for @entity5 , according to the independent @entity29			1
however , @entity16 figures recorded just 496 of these – meaning that 498 cases were classed as missing			2
the investigation identified 11 of these cases as late abortions , over 24 weeks , but in a further 107 cases the gestation of the baby was not known			2
in 47 cases , abortions for @entity5 were traced in the @entity16 figures , but other reasons had been given for the termination			1
the @entity29 knows the correct figures because hospitals alert it every time a diagnosis of @entity5 ’s is made and it tracks cases to a birth or termination			1
@entity16 figures are compiled using abortion forms filled in by doctors			2
the previous year ’s data , for 2011 , showed only 410 records on @entity5 ’s termination from the @entity29 could be matched by the @entity16 ’s official records , when in fact 937 @entity5 ’s terminations took place			1
as a growing number of women aged 40 - plus become mothers , the number of @entity5 pregnancies is also increasing and better screening means the majority of cases are diagnosed before birth			2
under the @entity68 , termination of a baby with @entity5 is legal right up to the point of delivery			0
such terminations are hugely controversial because due to medical advances , children with @entity5 ’s can now expect to live until their fifties and sixties			1
@entity77 mp @entity76 , chairman of the recent independent parliamentary inquiry into abortion for disability , said it was clear doctors had broken the law			2
‘ worryingly , the department appears to have made no attempt to see that the law is properly enforced , ’ she said			0
‘ we now know that nearly half of abortions for @entity5 were incorrectly recorded			1
how many doctors were referred for investigation ? none			0
‘ health ministers must act to restore public confidence in medical practitioners in this field			0
’ probe : an investigation by the @entity98 ( @entity99 , @entity100 , headquarters pictured ) revealed doctors have broken the law by failing to properly record the reasons for terminations professor @entity106 , director of the @entity29 , said : ‘ it has been very frustrating that people could pick up the official figures from the @entity16 , yet we all knew they were so inaccurate and there was no extra guidance to anyone to point them to the correct data			1
’ under the @entity68 a form must be completed by the doctor undertaking the termination and sent to the chief medical officer within 14 days of the abortion			0
professor @entity121 said : ‘ there is a form with a box to tick and there is no envelope provided			0
the doctor has to find the envelope and write the correct address on it			0
it is not a system designed to be easy in a busy clinical setting			0
’ @entity134 , of the @entity135 , said : ‘ we oppose abortion on any grounds , but are particularly shocked by the discrepancies revealed in this @entity16 analysis			0
‘ it was horrifying to read that 11 @entity5 abortions post 24 weeks do not even appear in the official dataset			2
’ a @entity16 spokesman said : ‘ doctors have a legal duty to report all abortions , including those due to fetal anomalies , to the chief medical officer			0
’ the spokesman added that the department was working with the @entity151 to tighten up the system .			0
