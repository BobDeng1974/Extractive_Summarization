morning call : @entity1 will broadcast the first call to prayer for the 30 days of @entity5			1
there are five calls to prayer each day @entity1 ’s head of factual programming @entity22 said the channel would act as a ‘ nationwide tannoy system ’ for @entity9 ’s 2.8million muslims while they observed @entity5			1
he said almost five per cent of the @entity9 population would ‘ actively engage ’ in @entity5 this month , adding : ‘ can we say the same of other national events that have received blanket coverage on television such as the @entity32 ’s coronation anniversary ? ’ critics questioned whether the decision to transmit the call to prayer was a ‘ publicity - seeking stunt ’ by the controversial broadcaster			1
mr @entity22 said @entity5 usually received minimal coverage on @entity9 ’s main television channels and said he believed @entity1 ’s series of programmes during july and august was chance for @entity9 ’s moderate @entity26 to be heard			1
earlier this year the channel was criticised for giving militant @entity46 , the former head of banned @entity48 organisation @entity47 , a platform to air his views			1
@entity46 and radical @entity51 were given a slot of the broadcaster ’s @entity53 , a two - minute opinion show which airs immediately after @entity55 ’ nightly bulletin			0
mr @entity22 told the @entity57 that most television coverage of @entity11 was linked to terrorism or extremism			0
he said : ‘ even when moderate @entity26 do appear , it ’s often only to provide a counterpoint to these issues			0
' @entity65 tannoy system ' : @entity1 says it wants to cater to the 2.8million @entity26 who observe @entity66 are restrictions on religious programming , including a ban on seeking recruits ‘ following the horrific events in @entity73 and subsequent reprisals against @entity26 , there has surely never been a more pressing need to give a voice to the moderate mainstream majority			2
’ the call to prayer is usually delivered from a mosque and is sometimes relayed by loudspeaker			1
there are five calls to prayer a day but @entity1 said it would only broadcast the first morning call to prayer each day			1
all the daily prayers will be played on the channel ’s website			0
it will be delivered by musician @entity89 and accompanied by a three - minute video showing him outside various @entity93 landmarks , including @entity94			0
the first broadcast will be next tuesday ( july 9 ) , the first day of @entity5 , at 3am			1
muslims around the world fast between sunrise and sunset during @entity5 , the ninth month of the @entity11 calendar			2
@entity1 will also include the sunrise and sunset times during its weather reports			2
the broadcaster said it had consulted @entity3 clerics about its series of @entity5 programmes			2
mr @entity22 said : ‘ the calls to prayer prompt @entity26 to carry out quiet moments of worship , but hopefully they ’ll also make other viewers sit up and notice that this event is taking place			2
controversial : @entity1 came under fire after giving airtime to militant @entity46 ‘ no doubt @entity1 will be criticised for focusing attention on a “ minority ” religion but that ’s what we ’re here to do - provide space for the alternative and a voice to the under - represented			1
’ his comments attracted some criticism among far - right groups and commentators			0
a group called @entity131 , which describes itself as a ‘ patriotic political movement ’ , said on @entity133 : ‘ get ready for a month ’s worth of tv programmes pandering to @entity11 courtesy of @entity1			0
’ the group ’s followers expressed outrage about the decision , including calls for a boycott of @entity1			2
there are restrictions on religious programming on @entity9 television , including a ban on seeking recruits			0
religious organisations are banned from running national terrestrial stations , although there are some religious radio stations and satellite or digital channels			0
there is also a legal requirement for the @entity157 and @entity158 to broadcast a certain amount of religious programming			0
the new archbishop of @entity161 warned earlier this year that dropping religion from television schedules would have ‘ dangerous ’ consequences and would ‘ cultivate ignorance ’			0
the most reverend @entity166 praised @entity158 ’s @entity168 and @entity1 ’s show @entity11 : the @entity169 as examples of good religious programming			0
@entity172 , president of the @entity173 , questioned whether @entity1 ’s decision to broadcast the call to prayer was a ‘ publicity - seeking stunt ’			1
he said : ‘ it seems reasonable that there should be some acknowledgment on tv of the needs of the growing @entity3 population in @entity9 , although one ca n’t help wondering whether this is just another of @entity1 ’s publicity - seeking stunts			0
‘ given that the @entity157 devotes hundreds of hours a year to @entity186 , with two or three church services every day on its radio stations , and hardly any mention of minority religions , a few minutes devoted to @entity11 does n’t seem unreasonable			0

call to prayer usually delivered from a mosque and relayed by loudspeaker
five calls a day but @entity1 will only broadcast the morning call for the 30 days of @entity5
broadcaster had been criticised in the past for giving airtime to extreme @entity48 views
