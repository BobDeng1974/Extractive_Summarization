only at this @entity1 could a goal almost bring down an aircraft			1
only here , in @entity4 , could a pilot be ordering his passengers to stop celebrating			1
they have been broadcasting matches live on flights these past few weeks and one @entity10 reporter informed us how the aircraft he was aboard on saturday began to ‘ wobble ’ when @entity13 opened the scoring in this extraordinary encounter			1
the pilot , said our reporter , was more than a little concerned , barking at them all to sit down			2
one only hopes he had landed the plane before @entity22 ’s penalty bounced off a post because if it was anything like the @entity25 there ’s a chance the windows would have blown			2
the ear - splitting noise and this sense of nerve - shredding , blessed relief			2
the sight of @entity54 praying in the centre - circle during those agonising moments between the end of extra time and the shoot - out			2
the sight of @entity40 in tears before a penalty had even been kicked			0
a goalkeeper from @entity64 but currently on loan at @entity66 dedicated his man of the match award to ‘ the 200million people of @entity4 ’			1
but those 200million @entity69 are going to need therapy before the end of this @entity1			1
it might have been @entity73 and his squad who admitted to suffering from anxiety attacks			0
just as it might have been @entity80 who said that , were it not for @entity73 holding them all together , the players would have cracked up already			0
but the people @entity73 and his players speak of in almost every address they make may not be able to take much more			0
higher powers : @entity4 's @entity54 prays before the penalty shoot out @entity88 headed : @entity32 wheel away after bringing @entity29 back into the game in the first half poster boy : the weight of @entity4 's @entity1 expectation once again fell on @entity34 @entity94 ! @entity95 had a second half goal disallowed for handball as @entity4 chased a winner contested : @entity95 appeals to officials that the ball did not touch his hand from the taxi drivers to those fortunate enough to have a match ticket , they ca n’t dare to dream because they remain gripped by a collective fear of failure			1
by the idea that a tournament that has so far exceeded all our expectations might just continue without them			0
that @entity34 , their darling @entity34 , might be reduced to nothing more than a spectator while @entity117 , heaven forbid , takes centre stage			1
when you travel through the host cities before a game people do seem to be carrying on with their everyday lives			0
but when @entity4 play the country undergoes a staggering transformation			1
the roads empty , even in @entity128			0
on one journey from this ground to @entity39 ’s airport it was like having a private motorway			0
for those inside this marvellous stadium an outstanding game of football dragged them through a full spectrum of emotions			0
the ecstasy of @entity13 ’s goal ; the sense of despair when @entity95 made the mistake that enabled the brilliant @entity32 to equalise ; never mind the anger at @entity148 ’s controversial yet courageous decision to disallow @entity95 ’s goal and give him a yellow card for handball			1
it certainly blew a rather large hole in @entity29 ’s theory about favouritism			2
sloppy @entity156 ! former @entity158 striker came within inches of restoring @entity4 's lead close call : @entity29 forward @entity162 hit the crossbar in the final minute of extra-time nothing , however , compared to deafening noise when @entity34 was elevated to the position of match winner			1
what made it all the more uncomfortable for @entity4 for the 120 minutes prior to that was the quality of this @entity29 side			1
a side that boasts an impressive combination of style , sophistication and hard graft			0
extra time simply meant another 30 minutes of agony			0
the terrifying prospect of penalties too			2
on @entity69 television the commentators were said to be capturing the mood			0
they were expressing the view , in the most sombre , pessimistic tones , that @entity29 were growing in stature throughout the second half ; growing in the belief that the biggest scalp of all was here for the taking			1
‘ i believe , ’ they cried , as much in desperation as anything as the match moved towards the lottery of spot - kicks			1
when @entity162 hit the crossbar , mouths opened and hearts stopped			0
when @entity13 then ran at the ball like a long jumper and almost burst the net with his shot , the place erupted			2
but @entity211 ’s miss , indeed @entity95 ’s miss , would only add to the agony , ageing a nation by years in a matter of minutes			0
‘ i hope we do n’t have any more penalty shoot - outs going forward because i fear my friends and family will have heart attacks , ’ said @entity40			2
not to mention 200million others			0
wicked @entity148 : @entity4 players plead with the @entity10 referee during the game @entity224 : @entity73 reacts to a decision by @entity10 referee @entity148 let off ! @entity226 was fortunate to escape without a booking after a first - half foul on @entity229 ( r ) it was all yellow ! @entity4 fans celebrate their side 's opening goal against @entity29			1

@entity4 defeated @entity29 on penalties to move into the @entity1 *quarter* - finals
@entity13 claimed the opening goal for the @entity1 hosts
@entity242 winger @entity241 equalised for @entity29 in the first - half
@entity245 ended 1 - 1 after extra-time to move into penalties , which @entity4 won 3 - 2 with @entity34 scoring their final spot - kick
