on friday the company said updated settings controls will show the people , pages and groups you follow that posted the most in the past week , along with a summary			1
facebook users will then be offered the option of seeing fewer posts from particular people - without having to conspicuously ' unfollow ' or ' unfriend ' them			1
users will also be able to see a list of others they have ' unfollowed ' - meaning you can quickly add persistent posters you have cut from your @entity30 in a moment of anger , @entity33 reports			2
the company are being commended for giving more power to its users - following past criticisms that it has too much control over what people view			1
instead of a straight chronological list of posts from friends and family , the company uses algorithms to show an edited feed - with posts that are deemed more important being bumped to the top of the page			2
