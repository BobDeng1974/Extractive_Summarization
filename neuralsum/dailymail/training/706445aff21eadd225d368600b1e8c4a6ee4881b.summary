by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 09:46 est , 20 september 2012 updated : 01:33 est , 21 september 2012 the photographer who took the topless pictures of the @entity5 is @entity6 , it was claimed today			1
@entity8 paparazzo @entity7 said the the royal couple were staked out at the chateau while on their holiday by an @entity13 living in the south of @entity8			1
mr @entity7 also sensationally claimed that the photographer was spying on them on the orders of @entity8 's @entity18 , which was first to publish 13 intimate images of @entity5 and @entity20 last week			1
mr @entity7 , in his 40s , is a close friend of former @entity8 first lady @entity42 and one of @entity8 's most notorious long lens photographers			2
denial : if true , the claim would exonerate @entity8 photographer @entity47 , who claims she took bikini photos of @entity5 but not topless ones he told @entity51 newspaper in @entity52 : ' the irony of this whole thing is that the photographer who took these pictures is an @entity13 living in the south of @entity8			1
' these photos were taken on the orders of @entity18 , who asked him to sit around for several days to take them			0
' for his efforts he did not earn a lot			0
he could have sold them for 10,000 euros			0
' but in fact he was just paid his wages for going to take them			2
' he did n't put them on the open market either , where he could have earned a lot more			1
' another @entity8 photographer outside the @entity73 where the snaps were taken was a @entity8 woman named @entity47 - nicknamed the sewer because of the pronunciation of her surname			1
she has admitted taking pictures of @entity5 in her bikini , but said she does not know who took the topless photos			1
the @entity83 couple this week won a landmark injunction preventing further distribution of the images by @entity18 , under the threat of a 100,000 euro fine			0
they have also handed over all files containing the images to representatives of the couple on the orders of the judge , after they were ruled a ' brutal ' invasion of privacy			0
the court made no ruling for the magazine to name the photographer , however , and it has the right to protect his or identity under @entity8 's laws on protection of journalistic sources			1
meanwhile a criminal investigation is under way to find and prosecute the photographer - who could face a year in jail and a Â£ 36,000 fine			0
@entity111 marks the spot : the long lens pictures taken of the topless @entity114 were shot from the side of the road between trees around half a mile away from the chateau yet the photos are still being touted on the open market worldwide , with magazines in @entity122 , @entity27 and @entity25 all publishing them			1
closer published 13 grainy images of @entity5 's breasts and bottom last thursday , branded ' grotesque and unjustifiable ' by a @entity83 spokesman			1
mr @entity7 did not specifically say he knew the identity of @entity5 's photographer , but is known to be very well connected among the @entity8 paparazzi community			1
he defended the person who took them , adding : ' as a photographer , i take the pictures i want and let the publication decide whether to print them			2
@entity122 magazine @entity137 also published the pictures , while @entity139 , editor of the @entity140 , was suspended after publishing a selection that he called ' tasteful ' ' what they choose to print is not the photographer 's problem , but the editor 's			2
' there are thought to be up to 200 photos taken of @entity5 and @entity20 at the time - many of them much more explicit			1
closer magazine 's editor @entity151 defended her decision to publish 13 of the photos , insisting the images were ' joyous '			2
she said : ' these photos are not in the least shocking			0
they show a young woman sunbathing topless , like millions of women you see on beaches			0
' they were not making any special effort to conceal themselves			0
critcising our magazine is stupid			0
' ms @entity168 also warned also that @entity18 had more photos , adding : ' intimate pictures exist that we have n't published and will not publish			2
probably other newspapers will choose to publish them			0
' video : editor - in - chief calls @entity5 pic ' nothing spectacular '			0

he said photographer was ' just paid his wages ' and could have earned a lot more on the open market
magazine has caused a storm by publishing intimate images of @entity20 and @entity5 on holiday
@entity190 has banned anyone in @entity8 from republishing the photos
@entity25 magazine republished them today and @entity27 publication will do so tomorrow
