@entity2 part - timers @entity0 can look forward to a visit to the @entity4 in december but it will be strictly tourism in the capital after @entity7 all but confirmed their passage into the @entity11 quarter - finals with a convincing win in wednesday night ’s first leg			1
@entity0 ’s 27 - year - old journeyman centre forward @entity14 , whose career has taken him to 14 clubs , scored a memorable first - half goal but it was not enough to keep the tie alive			2
third - tier side cornella – led by captain and dentist @entity22 – gave a good account of themselves in the first half but conceded twice from corners scored by @entity7 ’s @entity27 centre back @entity26 and were taken apart in the second half as the @entity30 holders got into their stride			1
@entity7 defender @entity26 leaps above @entity0 's defence to score against @entity11 opponents @entity34 @entity34 striker @entity14 ( left ) scored a shock equaliser in the 20th minute but the underdogs did not stay on level terms for long @entity26 doubled his tally for the night by beating @entity0 goalkeeper @entity39 to the ball @entity0 : @entity39 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 ( @entity44 57 ) , @entity45 , @entity22 , @entity46 , @entity47 ( @entity48 58 ) , @entity49 , @entity50 ( @entity51 72 ) , @entity14			1
subs not used : @entity53 , @entity54			0
goal : @entity14 20 @entity7 : @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity26 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 ( @entity63 77 ) , @entity64 ( @entity65 61 ) , @entity66 , @entity67 ( @entity68 77 )			1
subs not used : @entity70 , @entity71			0
goals : @entity26 10 , 36 , @entity66 53 , @entity65 75 that will not take the shine off the second leg but it will be a night for swapping shirts and taking in the sights as opposed to repeating the heroics of third division side @entity79 in the 2009 season , who they knocked @entity83 ’s @entity7 out of the competition at this stage			1
real never looked in trouble here			0
they scored on 10 minutes when a corner from @entity64 was headed in by @entity26			2
@entity0 were on level terms 10 minutes later when @entity90 took advantage of indecision in the @entity7 defence to beat @entity56 for the equaliser			2
but the dream died on 36 minutes when @entity26 got on the end of another corner , this time from @entity62 , to head @entity7 in front			1
in the second half @entity66 scored @entity7 ’s third with a cross shot leaving @entity102 in the minnows ’ goal helpless			1
playing at @entity106 ’s stadium because their own ground holds only 1,500 fans , @entity0 had effectively lost home advantage and although @entity7 coach @entity110 left @entity111 resting back in the capital along with @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115 there was still enough talent on display to see off @entity0 with @entity64 controlling things in midfield			0
@entity66 could and should have got the fourth from @entity62 ’s pass but could n’t reach the midfielder ’s pass at the back post			0
@entity65 came on as a second half substitute in place of @entity64 and with a licence to play further forward took full advantage by getting on the scoresheet to make it 4 - 1			2
@entity62 ’s shot was saved by @entity102 and @entity65 fired the rebound into the roof of the keeper ’s net			0
there were somersaults in his celebration for his 20th career goal for @entity7			0
the rest of @entity143 ’s last - 16 cup games will be played in december but with @entity7 off to compete in the @entity30 later that month they have been given special dispensation to play their first leg early			0
@entity146 , who they will play in a rearranged league match when the rest of @entity143 plays its first leg ties , were also allowed to bring forward their match			0
@entity26 is mobbed by his @entity7 team - mates after putting his side in the lead with 10 minutes on the clock @entity66 , @entity64 and @entity60 all congratulate the @entity27 defender @entity7 centre back @entity26 scored his first two goals of the season against the third division outfit @entity26 's effort heads towards the goal while @entity0 's defenders look on in hope that the ball does not nestle in the back of the net @entity110 named @entity62 in a strong @entity7 side alongside the likes of @entity67 , @entity64 and @entity66 @entity66 scores @entity7 's third to put the first leg of the @entity11 encounter beyond doubt as @entity67 captained the side @entity66 receives a hug from @entity64 after the @entity177 loanee scored in the 53rd minute @entity7 's @entity178 looks to the sky after scoring his fourth goal since sealing a season - long loan move to the @entity4 @entity7 ace @entity66 celebrates his goal by raising his hand in the air @entity65 celebrates his fourth goal of the match and 20th career goal for @entity7 with an acrobatic flip the @entity190 full back , pictured celebrating his side 's fourth goal , replaced @entity64 in the 61st minute @entity193 certain @entity111 will win @entity194			1

@entity26 netted two goals in the first half of his side 's @entity11 encounter against @entity34
@entity14 cancelled out @entity26 's opener before @entity7 moved into second gear
@entity177 loanee @entity66 and substitute @entity65 *completed* the rout
