for the first time , the government 's drug regulator - the @entity0 - has approved a remedy containing a traditional @entity5 herb			1
the product , @entity7 and @entity8 , contains sigesbeckia , a herb traditionally used to treat aches and pains caused by arthritis			1
' until now many gps have been wary of recommending @entity5 herbs , but now there is one product that we know is produced safely and at the optimum dose , ' explains professor @entity21 , a complementary medicine researcher from @entity22			1
@entity23 is a herb traditionally used to treat aches and pains caused by arthritis ' @entity23 gives us another alternative to anti-inflammatory drugs which come with potential side - effects such as gastrointestinal bleeding			1
' professor @entity21 does n't use the product himself , but says that before having hip replacements for arthritis he used another herb , @entity35 , as a remedy for joint pain			1
he is n't the only orthodox doctor who recommends complementary therapies to his patients ... herbal medicine for colds and depression dr @entity44 , a gp in @entity46 , @entity47 , and chairman of the @entity49 , says he is a ' fan ' of herbal medicines because they are ' safe , help to encourage self - care by patients and , in cases such as mint and aloe vera , can be grown by the patients themselves , making them virtually free '			1
' my go - to remedy in the cold season is a herb called pelargonium , which i take as soon as i feel a cold coming as it prevents the virus replicating , ' he says			1
' i also use mint tea for indigestion and make a remedy from the lemon balm that grows in my garden to help me sleep			1
you just put five leaves in a cup of boiling water and leave it to brew			0
the remedy i most commonly suggest to patients , though , is @entity76			1
there is strong evidence that it helps in tackling mild to moderate depression			0
it is also a potential treatment for long - term tiredness			0
' it can interfere with the contraceptive pill and some other medications - but it 's definitely something that i suggest patients should consider			1
' before taking @entity76 , check with your pharmacist or gp			0
dr @entity44 says he is a ' fan ' of herbal medicines because they are ' safe ' ( posed by model ) @entity93 for @entity94 professor @entity95 , a gastroenterologist at the @entity96 in @entity97 , specialises in helping people with severe @entity99 ( @entity99 )			1
' by the time they come to me most other treatments have failed , and i recommend hypnotherapy to probably 70 to 80 per cent of them as part of a treatment package including medication , diet and lifestyle changes			0
' it works on about 80 per cent of those who try it			0
@entity99 involves abnormal muscle spasms of the gut and hypersensitivity of the gut to pain , and is aggravated by stress			0
hypnotherapy tackles all three of these causes			0
' i have been taught self - hypnosis to help me sleep when my mind is whirring			0
i think it 's a skill every doctor should learn			1
' @entity126 for aches and pains dr @entity129 , an @entity130 who also works at the @entity132 in @entity133 , explains that as a child she was always given a glass of warm milk with half a teaspoon of the spice turmeric if she fell over			1
dr @entity129 was always given a glass of warm milk with half a teaspoon of the spice turmeric if she fell over ' only now do i know why that was - turmeric contains an ingredient called curcumin which has been found to have a powerful anti-inflammatory action			1
' now , if i see patients with problems like sports injuries , back pain , whiplash , fibromyalgia or sciatica , i suggest that they add a supplement of curcumin to their treatment - or , if they ca n't take painkillers , that they use it as their primary remedy			1
' my favourite remedy is called @entity161 capsules , which contain turmeric , but you can buy turmeric / curcumin capsules in health stores - or just add more to your cooking			1
' acupuncture for @entity168 dr @entity169 , a gp at @entity171 , near @entity172 in @entity173 , has been treating his patients with acupuncture for years			1
' i mostly offer this to patients for pain relief - particularly migraine			1
if medication or lifestyle changes such as reducing stress are n't working , acupuncture will often help			0
i normally give patients one session a week for four weeks			2
the number of gps in @entity189 who practise homeopathy ' i combine @entity5 acupuncture - which works along energy lines called meridians in the body , that @entity5 practitioners believe become imbalanced during illness - and @entity197 acupuncture , which concentrates the needles where it specifically hurts			1
' so for migraine , i 'd use the needles around the face , either side of the eyebrow , the cheek and just under the ear - along with points in the hands			0
' i decided to learn acupuncture when i was a junior doctor over 20 years ago			0
the evidence is good enough that the government health watchdog , @entity211 , recommends acupuncture on the @entity130 for migraines			2
' i have had acupuncture myself for neck pain in the past			0
exactly how it works is n't known but my personal theory is that it somehow stops the nerves being as sensitive to pain signals			0
' it 's a once - a - week treatment and there are no side - effects - it could save the @entity130 a fortune if it was used more widely			2
' yoga for skin complaints every morning dr @entity226 , a dermatologist and medical director of @entity228 , does ten to 15 minutes of yoga and 20 minutes ' meditation at lunchtime			2
' both help my stress levels and also benefit my skin , ' she says			0
' the stress hormone cortisol raises levels of inflammation in the skin - and this not only triggers faster ageing but aggravates conditions such as acne , eczema and rosacea			0
the stress hormone cortisol raises levels of inflammation in the skin - yoga can alleviate this ' for this reason i also advise my patients , whether they are coming to me for skin problems or merely for cosmetic procedures , to try yoga or meditation as part of their treatment plan			2
' they are often surprised by the idea , but many have experienced their skin flaring up when they are stressed , so once i explain the science behind why that happens they are very keen to include it			0
' @entity265 for @entity266 most conventional doctors are highly sceptical of homeopathy , questioning the idea that minute amounts of a substance that triggers symptoms can also be used to treat those symptoms			2
not so dr @entity274 , a gp in @entity276 , @entity277 , who has been a gp for 25 years and a homeopath for 20			2
' i use homeopathy myself - most commonly @entity281 , which i take when i get indigestion - and i do suggest the remedies to some of my patients			2
' it is helpful when conventional medication has nothing to offer , or where it 's contra - indicated			2
' for example , if i have a menopausal woman coming to see me with hot flushes and she ca n't take @entity292 because she has had breast cancer , or has been using @entity292 for the recommended two to four years and must come off it , there are a few homeopathic remedies i can suggest - belladonna being the most common			0
' homeopathy is also useful for chilblains - there are topical orthodox treatments for this but they are n't very effective			0
' the idea behind homeopathy is that dilute forms of substances that cause the symptoms of a condition can also help to treat it			2
' in a study of 20,000 people by @entity312 , 70 per cent of them said they felt a positive benefit			0

the government 's drug regulator has approved a ' herbal remedy '
@entity7 and @entity8 , contains sigesbeckia
the traditional @entity5 herb is traditionally used to treat aches and pains
dr @entity129 advises patients with aches to take a curcumin supplement
