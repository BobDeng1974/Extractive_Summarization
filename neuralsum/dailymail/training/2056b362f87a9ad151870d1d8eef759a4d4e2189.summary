miss @entity2 told the @entity22 : ‘ despite being a business journalist at the @entity8 for 10 years , working behind the scenes on our high - profile news programmes , i was viewed by some in the organisation to be “ too common for telly ”			1
‘ i remember at the end of one @entity8 job interview being told by the manager , “ i did n't realise people like you were clever ”			0
’ the presenter added : ‘ you would think that after nearly two years in the job , people would be used to my @entity40 tones			2
' to be fair most are , but there are still some viewers who ca n't accept that someone with my accent can have a brain			2
it means that i regularly get abuse about it			0
‘ i 've had tweets questioning whether i really did go to university because surely i would have lost my accent if i did ; a letter suggesting , very politely , that i get correction therapy ; and an email saying i should get back to my council estate and leave the serious work to the clever folk			2
’ miss @entity2 said : ‘ it 's inevitable that not everyone will like me			1
all presenters deal with that			0
what 's scary is the ignorance about what having a regional accent means			2
’ the presenter 's first job at the @entity8 was as a part - time researcher on now - defunct technology programme @entity69 , which she did while studying science at @entity72			1
she first presented on @entity14 in august last year , and is one of the show 's main relief presenters , presenting over christmas 2012			1
last october she hit the headlines after saying ‘ what the * * * * is that ? ’ off - screen on breakfast without realising her microphone was still switched on			1
during an item about musicals , host @entity111 had welcomed conductor @entity114 to the studio , showing a clip of his orchestra before wishing him a ‘ good beautiful morning ’			0
miss @entity111 later apologised for the ' unfortunate ' language and blamed a microphone not being turned off for the blunder			0

' @entity2 put this picture on her @entity79 feed - it shows her and fellow presenter @entity136 @entity40 girl : she was brought up in @entity12 ( pictured ) and first worked for @entity69 wrong accent ? former today programme presenter @entity139 was forced out of his job amid suggestions his accent was ' too posh ' in the 1950s , having a ' @entity8 accent ' meant that you spoke @entity145 , or the @entity147 's @entity146 , without a trace of a regional accent			1
more recently , however , speaking this way could do you out of a job at the corporation			0
in 2008 @entity153 presenter @entity139 was sacked by the @entity8 amid suggestions he sounded ' too posh '			0
embarrassed executives insisted that the hugely experienced presenter , who was educated at @entity157 and @entity158 , and who presented the flagship news programme for a decade , was leaving to ' pursue other projects ' and that modern listeners wanted a ' more light - hearted ' style of presenting			1
however @entity139 disputed this , saying : ' i am leaving because they have removed me and there are no other projects			0
' he went on to present @entity170 and @entity171 as well as sunday , @entity96 's main religious and current affairs news programme			2
in 2010 the @entity8 nailed its colours to the mast when @entity176 , director of @entity177 , said the corporation needed to ' increase the amount of network tv content which offers distinctive voices with an authentic sense of place			0
' she said more work should be done to ensure the @entity8 's output accurately reflected the @entity188 's nations and regions , but insisted ' accents on their own ' were not enough to make people from different parts of the @entity188 feel represented			0
