by @entity0 published : 06:39 est , 27 july 2012 updated : 09:35 est , 27 july 2012 two men with longstanding hiv infections no longer have detectable @entity3 in their blood cells years after having bone marrow transplants			1
the virus was easily detected in both men in their lymphocytes - blood cells that work to defend the immune system against attack - before the operation			2
however , it became undetectable eight months after the surgery			0
the patients , who were treated at @entity15 ( @entity15 ) , have remained on anti-retroviral therapy since the transplant			0
these drugs work to suppress the virus			0
@entity3 being released into human lymphatic tissue : scientists have found no @entity3 in two patients ' cells after they had bone marrow transplants ' this gives us some important information , ' said dr @entity29			1
' it suggests that under the cover of anti-retroviral therapy , the cells that repopulated the patient 's immune system appear to be protected from becoming re-infected with @entity3			1
' one patient 's bone marrow transplant was two years ago while the other was four years ago			1
over time , as the patients ' cells were replaced by donor cells , traces of @entity3 were lost			2
the level of @entity3 antibody , a measure of exposure to @entity3 , also declined in both men			0
' we expected @entity3 to vanish from the patients ' plasma , but it is surprising that we ca n't find any traces of @entity3 in their cells , ' said dr @entity53			2
' the next step is to determine if there are any traces of @entity3 in their tissue			0
' @entity58 known as the ' @entity59 ' and the only person to have been cured of @entity61 , after having bone marrow from someone known to be resistant to @entity3 the research team is currently designing studies that would enable them to look for @entity3 in the tissues			1
researchers also plan to study additional hiv - positive patients who have undergone a bone marrow transplant			1
researchers point out that there are two key differences between the @entity15 patients and the ' @entity77 patient , ' @entity58 , who was functionally cured of @entity3 after a stem cell transplant			2
in the @entity77 patient 's case , his donor was specifically chosen because the donor had a genetic mutation that resisted @entity3			0
the @entity15 patients ' bone marrow transplants were done without any thought to selecting an @entity3 - resistant donor			1
second , the @entity77 patient ceased anti-retroviral therapy after his transplant , while the @entity15 patients have remained on anti-retroviral therapy			0
their cases will be presented at the @entity93 at the @entity15 in @entity94 .			0

one man has had no detectable @entity3 in his blood cells for two years while the other has been clear for four
study suggests stem cells from done bone marrow are protected from being re-infected by @entity3
