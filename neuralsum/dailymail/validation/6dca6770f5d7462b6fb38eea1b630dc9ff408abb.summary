@entity0 will be asked by the @entity1 to resign his position as honorary president of cycling 's world governing body after an independent report accused him of colluding with @entity8 and other riders to conceal doping offences			1
the man who stood as @entity1 president between 1991 and 2005 , and remains in a senior position in the organisation as well as an honorary member of the @entity16 , was accused of being complicit in one of the biggest cover - ups in sporting history in an independent report into cycling 's doping past			1
here at the @entity1 headquarters in @entity24 today the current president of the organisation , @entity25 , said he would be writing to @entity0 personally to call for him to stand down			1
@entity0 is being asked to resign from his position as honorary president of the @entity1 @entity0 ( left with @entity8 in march 2003 ) is alleged to have interfered in doping issues to protect his star riders such as the disgraced former @entity30 superstar @entity25 , the current @entity1 president will write to @entity32 personally calling for his resignation ' i am very concerned by what i have seen in the report and i will be writing to him asking him to consider his position as an honorary president , which was awarded to him by the @entity39 of the @entity1 when he retired as president , ' said @entity25			1
' not everything @entity42 did was bad or wrong			2
he built this organisation into a strong organisation			2
but clearly , as is shown in report , decisions were made at that time which were about protecting the reputation of the sport rather than the integrity of the sport			0
' there were serious errors of judgement and @entity42 really should consider his position now			0
' if @entity0 refuses @entity25 said it would then become a matter for the @entity39			1
' the @entity1 @entity39 was the body that awarded him that status and maybe it would be that they reconsider that in september , ' he said			1
@entity65 's exclusive scoop on the @entity8 doping scandal , @entity67 back page from november 18 @entity25 also accepts the @entity69 report is right to suggest that doping remains a serious problem for the current professional peloton			1
' one of the things it says is that things have improved substantially in terms of doping in cycling , ' said @entity25			1
' but it does still say that there is room for further improvement			0
' i think what they have said is a pretty accurate reflection			0
but there is some interpretation there			0
there are a whole range of contributions , some of which have been picked up by the media			0
for instance , one person said 90 per cent of the peloton is still doping			2
others have said the problem is much much less than that			0
i 'd like to think that it is the latter rather than the former			0
but there will always be people who will cheat			0
' reports allege that the @entity1 acted favourably to @entity8 by not target - testing him despite suspicions			2

@entity1 honorary president @entity32 has been called to stand down
