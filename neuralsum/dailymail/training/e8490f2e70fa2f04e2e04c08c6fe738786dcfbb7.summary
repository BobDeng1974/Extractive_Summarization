by @entity1 reporter published : 16:04 est , 2 august 2012 updated : 17:49 est , 2 august 2012 the mother of @entity3 said in court papers she was kept from communicating with outsiders while at a resort in @entity7 and was unaware she had been reported missing			1
@entity8 declared in the documents obtained thursday that she had no idea she was the subject of a search until she accidentally heard a television report			1
she said she was told her doctor had ordered her to rest and she was flown to @entity16			0
at a spa , her cell phone was confiscated along with her @entity19 and she said she was kept in a room with no working phone or tv service			0
cut off : @entity8 , pictured in november , said she was planning to travel by motorhome to see her sons perform in @entity25 on july 14 when she was advised to fly instead , and ended up in @entity16 she said she asked about @entity3 's children and was told they were fine			1
according to documents obtained by @entity28 , mrs @entity8 said she was planning to travel by motorhome to see her sons perform in @entity25 on july 14 when she was advised by a doctor she should fly instead			1
@entity28 reports mrs @entity8 recalled the doctor arrived to her door ' stating he had been in contact with my longtime personal physician and was coming to check on me because my personal physician was unavailable			1
' she continued : ' the doctor advised that it was better for me to fly and not drive to @entity25			1
believing that the doctor was sent at the request of my longtime personal physician , i followed what i understood to be a doctor 's orders and boarded a flight as opposed to driving in the motorhome			0
' getting her grandchildren back : mrs @entity8 is set to become a co-guardian of @entity47 , far left , @entity48 , second from left , and @entity50 , centre , after recently having her sole guardianship temporarily rescinded instead , she was flown to @entity53 in @entity7			1
however , the matriarch did not specify who accompanied her there nor did she say who sent the doctor to her home			0
sharing the load : @entity61 will share guardianship of his young cousins with his grandmother the disclosure marked the latest development in a series of events that began when @entity8 was reported missing last month but later turned up at the spa with family members			1
the documents were released after a judge reinstated @entity8 as the guardian of the children in an arrangement that also keeps their cousin as temporary co-guardian			1
superior court judge @entity79 said during a hearing that an investigator who looked into the children 's care found that the late pop star 's 82 - year - old mother was an excellent guardian and the children love her very much			2
' i think the kids are in terrific hands , ' the judge said			1
' it appears from the report that @entity8 has done a wonderful job and cares about the children very much			1
' @entity79 noted that the children , @entity50 , 15 , @entity48 , 14 and @entity47 , 10 , also have a close relationship with their 34 - year - old cousin @entity61 , who was named temporary guardian last week after working closely with @entity8 since @entity3 died			1
@entity100 is ' incredibly respectful ' of the family matriarch and she is respectful of him , the judge said			0
@entity79 said he will finalize the arrangement later in the month but for now will issue letters of co-guardianship allowing both @entity105 to make decisions about the children 's welfare			2
@entity61 's new co-guardianship status is temporary , but the judge could make it permanent when he convenes the next court hearing on august 22			1
the shared guardianship plan is apparently designed to remove pressure from @entity8 who was previously named in her son 's will as the children 's sole guardian			2
on the contrary : mrs @entity8 was surrounded last month by @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity122 's daughter - along with a manager for the resort where was staying - to quell rumours she was held against her will emotional : mrs @entity8 read a statement claiming she was ' devastated ' to lose custody and said she had been on a ' short vacation ' , contrary to her deposition @entity132 , her lawyer , has said the arrangement will allow his client to focus on the children 's upbringing and not on home or logistics issues			1
@entity79 said then that he did n't believe @entity3 had done anything wrong but suspended her guardianship duties because she had been out of contact with her grandchildren for 10 days			2
close : @entity143 was named by @entity3 in his will as a potential guardian of the children the changes in guardianship come on the heels of family dissension over @entity3 's will , which left nothing to his siblings when he died three years ago			0
several of them signed a letter that was leaked to the media alleging the will was a fake and calling on executors of the estate to resign			0
the dispute at one point led to a driveway confrontation involving several family members at the @entity165 mansion where @entity8 and the children have been living			2
on wednesday , @entity167 issued a plea for peace in the family and withdrew his support of the letter			0
' mistakes have been made and irrational things have been said on both sides in a highly charged emotional environment , ' @entity167 wrote			0
' it is time for us all to draw a line in the sand and move toward peace , co-operation , love and healing			0
' he wrote that the family is still raw from @entity3 's death , and his mother has endured incredible stress and pressures since then			0
next steps : lawyers acting on behalf of the @entity186 and estate spoke about the latest hearing in @entity194 today another party to the @entity3 family drama , singer @entity143 , who was named by @entity3 in his will as a potential guardian of the children if @entity8 was not available , issued a statement saying the recent turmoil is a private matter and should n't be playing out publicly			2
legend : @entity3 , pictured in may 2005 , left a reported $ 1billion legacy to his children @entity207 and @entity3 were longtime friends before his death in 2009			0
@entity207 , who lives on the @entity211 , came to @entity212 to visit with the @entity186 on wednesday , @entity8 's lawyer said , adding the singer supports the co-guardianship arrangement			2
she has been given notice of court proceedings , but the new agreement apparently will relieve her of any possible guardianship duties , specifying that @entity8 and @entity61 could replace each other if one or the other became unavailable to serve			1
mr @entity221 told @entity28 : ' ms @entity143 met with @entity8 , and the children yesterday			0
it was a very thoughtful and pleasant meeting			0
ms. @entity143 had no issues with signing off on the proposed new custody agreement			0
' meanwhile , mrs @entity8 's declaration directly contradicts statements she made in an @entity229 interview , in which she said she voluntarily cut off communication with the outside world			2
with her children @entity121 , @entity122 , and @entity120 - and the marketing manager of the resort where she was staying - the matriarch tried to explain : ' one reason i did n't call is i just gave up my phone and i did n't want to have any phone calls while i was here			0
