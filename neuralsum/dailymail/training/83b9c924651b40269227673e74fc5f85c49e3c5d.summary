the morning after the night of @entity0 dawned brilliant and sunny over @entity1			1
the only cloud on @entity4 ’s horizon was the @entity6 ’s insistence that the first defence of his world super-bantamweight title must be against a little - known @entity9			1
@entity11 ’s newest world champion has secured himself not only a championship belt but also a rich range of options for mouth - watering title unification fights against stellar opponents			0
@entity4 and his mentor @entity28 have a different wish list			0
after saturday near shut - out conquest of @entity23 , they arrived at a late - night press conference with @entity4 wearing a @entity34 outfit			1
the message to an @entity6 official in attendance in @entity1 ’s iconic @entity38 was that a big - money duel with @entity40 is more to their liking			1
that @entity44 - based @entity43 is @entity28 ’s preference			0
@entity4 would like to settle a score with his @entity48 rival , @entity49 ‘ regular ’ champion @entity19			1
@entity28 – the @entity0 ’s promoter and manager as well as his inspiration – says : ‘ @entity19 can only draw about 800 fans on his home turf in @entity55 but we could have another 16,000 crowd here in @entity1			1
’ bloody battle : @entity4 lands a punch on @entity23 on his way to winning the world titlte world class : @entity4 proved his quality in his unanimous points decision over @entity23 down you go : @entity4 puts @entity23 on the floor during their bout in @entity1 that gathering to see @entity4 score a landslide points victory over @entity23 marked his potential as a cross-over star			1
not only is @entity4 bridging the sectarian divide in @entity75 – the way @entity28 did before him – but he is attracting a new generation of younger , non-boxing support			0
@entity75 is united behind him and @entity28 says : ‘ @entity4 is becoming the greatest boxer in @entity81 history			0
’ many hold @entity28 in that regard but the former world featherweight champion adds : ‘ this young man is a better boxer than i ever was			0
’ a contemporary slant on @entity4 ’s prowess came from @entity88 , the @entity89 who is no relation to @entity91 ’s @entity23 but until recently the world ’s outstanding middleweight			1
crowning moment : @entity4 is awarded the win by the referee after winning the fight on points lift me up : @entity100 celebrates his victory with trainer @entity102 one of the many celebrities at the open - air ringside in a temporary arena constructed on the slipway down which the @entity107 was launched , @entity23 said : ‘ @entity4 is the most exciting young fighter in the world today			1
’ he looked just that as he pummelled the other @entity23 to comprehensive defeat by 119 points to 109 on my card , 119 - 108 in the view of two of the judges and 118 - 111 according to the third official			2
@entity4 is capable of adding further belts to his collection against @entity19 and @entity18			2
but if he must accommodate @entity120 first then at least it will give him the chance to present himself to the @entity9 audience			0
that situation has arisen because @entity23 was granted a dispensation to earn bigger bucks in @entity1 on condition that @entity27 is given his shot at the winner with 90 days of negotiating terms			2
sealed with a kiss : @entity4 celebrates winning the fight with wife @entity132 @entity28 – well aware that this has much to do with the network television rivalry here between @entity136 and @entity137 – will bide his time after reporting that @entity4 fractured his left hand on the resilient cranium of @entity23			2
he had to keep punching away for the full 12 rounds because while the @entity142 resembled a bull being stuck by a picador , @entity4 could not kill him off with a matador flourish			0
@entity23 is not lacking what the @entity146 call ‘ cajones ’ and after beating him here for the second time in 18 months @entity4 told him : ‘ i respect you more than boxer i ’ve ever fought but forgive me for saying i hope i never see you again			2
’ next up : @entity9 @entity151 ( left ) is the mandatory challenger while @entity28 wants @entity40 grudge match : @entity4 has a personal score to settle with @entity19 ( left ) , but he 'll have to wait @entity23 had recovered from his first defeat in @entity1 to win this title but @entity4 has improved even more dramatically in the interval			1
his hand speed while counter-punching was the key to keeping the aggressive @entity23 at bay and he looks close to the finished article after only 19 professional fights			0
a wariness of the @entity142 ’s power stopped him going for the knock - out which the crowd bayed for their @entity167 to deliver			0
but on an electrifying night they witnessed a very classy all - round performance			0
the world , as well as @entity1 , is now @entity4 ’s stage , whoever he fights in the coming months .			2

@entity4 beat @entity23 on points to win @entity6 title in @entity1
@entity0 targets unification bouts with @entity19 and @entity40
@entity4 maintains *unbeaten* record after win over @entity23
