by @entity0 published : 08:29 est , 11 july 2013 updated : 10:33 est , 11 july 2013 while labour is often a intense experience , few mothers can boast of such a dramatic track record as one mother - of - seven			0
sheep farmer @entity6 has had three of her babies - including her latest - in motorway laybys while en route to the hospital , and a fourth in an army garrison she was passing when the baby put in its speedy appearance			1
it is little wonder she struggles to make it to the maternity ward : @entity6 , 38 , lives on a remote sheep farm in the @entity20 which is two hours ' drive from the nearest hospital			1
the latest addition , a little 7lb girl called @entity23 , arrived at 1.25am last wednesday after the ambulance pulled over in a layby @entity6 with ( @entity28 ) @entity27 , 18 months , baby @entity23 and @entity29 , 4 , all of whom were born on road laybys after @entity6 's labour progressed suddenly add to this the fact that @entity6 often has extremely fast labours - sometimes giving birth in as little as eight minutes			1
@entity6 has been told by her doctors she ca n’t give birth at home , because she lives too far away from medical help if anything goes wrong			1
she has also been instructed not to call for an ambulance until she is certain the baby is on its way , meaning she has frequently made her own way to the hospital			2
@entity49 , seen here with baby @entity29 , has been told that she can not have home birth because she is at a higher risk and her home is too far from medical help ' it is a catch - 22 situation , ' said @entity6 , who runs the 2,000 - acre , 900 - sheep @entity56 , near @entity57 , with husband @entity58			1
' because where we live is so remote , ambulances will not come unless they are sure i am in labour and i can not have a home birth because i am deemed high risk , ' she explains			2
the latest addition to the family , a 7lb girl called @entity23 , arrived at 1.25am last wednesday after @entity6 had , in fact , been picked up in an ambulance after she woke in the night with labour pains			1
@entity72 is held by big sister @entity73 after his dramatic birth in an army garrison after rather confused soldiers found a room for @entity6 when her ambulance was forced to pull in en route to hospital the ambulance pulled over in a layby at @entity82 , just down the road from her home			1
the ambulance had come from one of the nearer ambulance stations , at @entity86 , @entity87 , 40 minutes away			0
it was on its way to the @entity90 at @entity91			0
the family live on a remote sheep farm in the @entity20 which is two hours ' drive from the nearest hospital despite her colourful history of giving birth , @entity6 has not ruled out having another child in the future @entity87 , more than 50 miles away along winding country roads			1
' i have a history of quick labour , ' she said			0
' i ’m not allowed to come into hospital by myself			0
' on tuesday i ran around after the sheep , had some pork scratchings and my contractions started without warning			0
@entity23 with her father @entity58 , who was in the ambulance when it pulled over and @entity6 gave birth ' i woke up at midnight , poked my husband and told him to get an ambulance			1
we only got as far as the layby at @entity82 three miles away			0
' it only took ten minutes from stopping to having a new baby			0
i told the ambulance to just take me home but i had to go to hospital			2
' @entity29 , four , was also born in an ambulance at a layby			1
she arrived about an hour into the journey at @entity123 , @entity87			0
and @entity27 , aged 18 months , arrived in a layby at @entity125 , about half an hour from home			1
before she was banned from driving to hospital her husband was driving her to hospital in his @entity130 when she realised she would n’t make it			2
seven - year - old @entity72 was born at the vast @entity132 , near @entity133 , @entity87 , after bemused soldiers found a room for her			1
her first child , @entity73 , 12 , was planned as a home birth because of the foot and mouth epidemic , but it was a difficult birth and in the end she had to be rushed into hospital for a c - section			2
then came @entity142 , 10 weeks premature , born at home			2
and @entity144 , three , who made her big entrance at hospital , after a super-quick eight - minute labour			0
' we had a nurse come around to show me some exercises , ' said @entity6			2
' i said i will just carry on working because it is the same movements for sheep shearing			0
' despite their already large family , @entity6 remains coy about adding to the brood			0
' we do n’t plan things like this , there may or may not be more			0
