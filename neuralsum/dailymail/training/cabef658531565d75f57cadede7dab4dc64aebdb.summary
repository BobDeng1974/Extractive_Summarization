by @entity1 reporter published : 09:45 est , 7 november 2013 updated : 10:46 est , 7 november 2013 heart - clogging trans fats have been slowly disappearing from grocery aisles and restaurant menus in the last decade			2
now , the @entity5 is finishing the job			1
the @entity5 plans to announce later thursday that it will require the food industry to gradually phase out all trans fats , saying they are a threat to people 's health			1
commissioner @entity13 said the move could prevent 20,000 heart attacks a year and 7,000 deaths			1
the @entity5 on thursday is announcing a ban on all trans fats , which will be phased out by the food industry @entity20 said that while the amount of trans fats in the country 's diet has declined dramatically in the last decade , they ' remain an area of significant public health concern			1
' the trans fats have long been criticized by nutritionists , and @entity30 and other local governments have banned them			2
the agency is n't yet setting a timeline for the phase - out , but will collect comments for two months before officials determine how long it will take			0
different foods may have different timelines , depending how easy it is to substitute			0
' we want to do it in a way that does n't unduly disrupt markets , ' says @entity44 , @entity5 's deputy commissioner for foods			1
still , he says , ' industry has demonstrated that it is by and large feasible to do			0
' to phase them out , the @entity5 said it had made a preliminary determination that trans fats no longer fall in the agency 's ' generally recognized as safe ' category , which is reserved for thousands of additives that manufacturers can add to foods without @entity5 review			1
once trans fats are off the list , anyone who wants to use them would have to petition the agency for a regulation allowing it , and that would be unlikely to be approved			2
trans fat is widely considered the worst kind for your heart , even worse than saturated fat , which can also contribute to heart disease			0
trans fats are often used in processed foods to preserve the texture and shelf life of food trans fats are used both in processed food and in restaurants , often to improve the texture , shelf life or flavor of foods			1
they are created when hydrogen is added to vegetable oil to make it more solid , which is why they are often called partially hydrogenated oils			0

many companies have already phased out trans fats , prompted by new nutrition labels introduced by @entity5 in 2006 that list trans fats and an increasing number of local laws that have banned them			1
though they have been removed from many items , the fats are still found in processed foods , including some microwave popcorns and frozen pizzas , refrigerated doughs and ready - to - use frostings			0
they are also sometimes used by restaurants that use the fats for frying			0
many larger chains have phased them out , but smaller restaurants may still get trans fats from suppliers			0
as a result of the local and federal efforts , consumers have slowly eaten fewer of the fats			0
according to the @entity5 , trans fat intake among @entity98 consumers declined from 4.6 grams per day in 2003 to around one gram per day in 2012			2
@entity5 officials say they have been working on trans fat issues for around 15 years — the first goal was to label them — and have been collecting data to justify a possible phase out since just after president @entity132 came into office in 2009			2
the advocacy group @entity134 first petitioned @entity5 to ban trans fats nine years ago			1
the group 's director , @entity136 , says the move is ' one of the most important lifesaving actions the @entity5 could take			2
' he says the agency should try and move quickly as it determines a timeline			0
' six months or a year should be more than enough time , especially considering that companies have had a decade to figure out what to do , ' @entity136 said .			0

@entity5 says artery *busting* fats are no longer considered safe
@entity5 hopes this will save 7,000 lives a year
they are used to improve texture , shelf life and flavor and have no health benefits
