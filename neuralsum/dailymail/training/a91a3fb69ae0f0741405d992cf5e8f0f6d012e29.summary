by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity2 : 12:33 est , 30 december 2013 @entity3 : 13:21 est , 30 december 2013 president @entity5 's party is nervous that he might face impeachment proceedings â € “ or at least it wants potential donors to think so			1
the @entity8 send a fundraising email on saturday , titled ' impeachment , ' that warned several @entity11 have raised the spectre of a move to bounce the president from office			1
' @entity11 are actually excited about the idea , ' the email said			2
' show these @entity11 that they are way , way off base and give president @entity5 a @entity20 that has his back			1
' the email was sent to supporters of @entity5 , the president 's political campaign organization , @entity22 reported , and sought contributions for 2014 congressional campaigns			2
it featured quotes from @entity32 sen. @entity31 , @entity34 rep. @entity33 , @entity36 rep. @entity35 , and @entity38 rep. @entity37 , all @entity11 who have openly used what @entity39 call ' the " i " word			0
' feeling the heat , but it 's just @entity43 : @entity44 is vacationing while his political party floats the threat of impeachment as a fundraising tool president @entity49 denied allegations of a sexual relationship with former @entity53 intern @entity52 in 1998 , and his similar denials in sworn testimony led to his impeachment rep. @entity37 ( @entity58 ) predicted that an impeachment vote against @entity5 would pass easily in the @entity60 , and rep. @entity35 ( r ) salivated about writing the articles of impeachment only two @entity1 presidents have been impeached : @entity65 and @entity49			1
neither was convicted of his charges in the @entity68 , a step that 's necessary before a president can be removed from office , in february 1999 , after @entity49 easily won acquittal on a perjury charge and dodged conviction for obstruction of justice by a single vote , @entity39 linked arms and sang the civil - rights anthem ' we shall overcome ' on the steps of the @entity82			1
@entity49 was impeached for lying under oath about an extramarital affair he carried on with a young @entity53 intern			1
@entity5 's troubles , by contrast , are more the stuff of political scandal than of legal jeopardy			0
his @entity92 staff altered @entity94 - approved talking points that named the terrorist group behind a 2012 attack that killed four @entity1 in @entity97 , @entity98			0
tea party groups and other conservatives were targeted for harassment by his @entity102 beginning in 2010 , a program that was later covered up			0
both of those choices , @entity11 say , were calculated efforts to secure @entity5 's re-election in 2012			0
the @entity39 sent out an email with infographics raising the spectre of an @entity5 impeachment and using the idea to raise money @entity5 ' has committed impeachable offenses , ' said rep. @entity33 , the @entity117 darling that @entity39 love to hate @entity5 is also under fire for lying to the @entity1 public with his assurances that they could keep existing health insurance plans and doctor - patient relationships under the @entity123			0
and his @entity124 repeatedly spied on journalists , including some at @entity126 and the @entity127 , in an effort to ferret out the source of national security leaks			0
as @entity5 struggles to change the subject from @entity123 to jobs and the economy , the @entity39 is focused on the 2014 congressional elections			2
they need to flip 17 @entity11 seats into their column in order to take back control of the @entity60 , an outcome that no national pollster has suggested is possible			0
but @entity11 stand a chance of taking over the @entity68 , something that would require victory in 6 of the 20 races where @entity8 incumbents are defending their seats			1
the @entity11 would also have to hang on to the 15 @entity11 - held seats that are up for grabs			0
@entity38 congressman @entity150 warned in 2013 that he would move to impeach the president if he introduced new gun ' unconstitutional ' gun - control measures conservatives have kept the idea of an @entity5 impeachment alive since his early years in office , beginning with so - called ' birthers ' who believe he is foreign - born and ineligible to be president write caption here @entity163 columnist @entity162 , a @entity164 , warned this year that the @entity97 affair is ' a potential impeachment issue as long as the @entity11 are in control of the @entity53 ' @entity126 host and former @entity170 gov. @entity169 predicted in may that the president ' will not serve out his full term			1
' at present , however , no member of @entity20 has officially filed articles of impeachment against president @entity5			1
a group of conservative lawmakers did , however , file papers to impeach attorney general @entity179 in november			2
that bill has not yet had a hearing .			0

@entity8 emailed supported with a fundraising *message* titled ' impeachment '
the @entity8 warned that ' @entity11 are actually excited about the idea '
no one in @entity20 has officially moved to impeach president @entity5 but several conservative lawmakers have raised the idea publicly
*democrats* are focused on the 2014 *midterm* elections , in which they could become an even *smaller* @entity53 *minority* and lose control of the @entity68
@entity49 and @entity65 are the only two presidents to be impeached ; both survived @entity68 votes and finished their terms in office
