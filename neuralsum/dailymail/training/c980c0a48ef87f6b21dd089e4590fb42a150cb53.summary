when you ’ve done a six - month tour of duty in the badlands of @entity6 , the prospect of an @entity2 play - off decider is n’t too frightening			1
neither , for that matter , is a test debut			0
@entity9 is pursuing two careers in tandem ; rugby player and soldier			1
last weekend , his parallel worlds collided as he made a try - scoring contribution to the @entity17 ’s victory over the @entity18 in front of 80,000 supporters at @entity21			1
the 26 - year - old @entity22 is making waves on the wing for @entity25 , putting him on course to play for @entity27 in the near future			1
but he has already served his adopted country in battle of the life - and - death variety , with bullets and bombs to contend with , rather than tackles and tries			1
national service : @entity25 winger @entity37 whie on tour with the army in @entity40 rising star : @entity22 - raised @entity9 has impressed in his first full @entity2 season for @entity25 @entity43 drew comparisons between the field of play and the field of combat , saying that ‘ sport is war minus the shooting ’ , and @entity9 agrees there are similarities between the two arenas			1
‘ out there in @entity40 , it is like when you ’re playing rugby ; you look after each other , ’ he said			1
‘ you depend on the guys around you and they depend on you			0
we all cover each other ’s backs			2
’ a military life was all but inevitable for @entity9 , who was keen to continue a long family tradition of joining the forces			1
he is a lance corporal in the @entity67 , and his younger brother is based in @entity69 with the @entity70 and is due to go to @entity40 later this year			1
his father is currently on a @entity73 peacekeeping mission in @entity74			1
front line : @entity9 runs in a try for @entity17 in their 30 - 17 defeat of @entity18 at @entity21 on may 3 having graduated from the army training centre at @entity80 in @entity81 , he was deployed as a tank driver , before being sent to @entity6 as a foot soldier			1
despite the constant dangers , he relished being able to put his combat ability to the test on the front line			2
no fear : the lance corporal will do battle harlequins in their shoot - out for a play - off spot on saturday ‘ when i went to @entity40 , i was attached to an infantry regiment , ’ he said			1
‘ i was on foot patrols four times a day in the north of the province where most of the action was going on			0
i spent six to eight months out there , patrolling day - in , day - out			2
‘ it was scary at times , but it is pretty much like rugby			2
you can practise all the time , but you can only find out how good you are when you actually do the job			0
‘ we had trained for a year or two , so it was a chance to use our skills , but you know there ’s no room for mistakes			2
‘ the risks are so much more than in rugby			2
two of my mates were shot , but they just had flesh wounds			0
a marine died on the week we arrived			0
he stepped on an @entity119 ( improvised explosive device ) , it blew off both his legs and he was gone			0
there was a lot of small - arms fire , and the threat of suicide bombers			2
’ @entity9 initially believed he would have to make a choice between a military and sporting career , but soon discovered that the @entity17 would encourage his desire to pursue both			1
having grown up in the village of @entity133 , near @entity22 ’s capital , @entity135 , he set his sights on emulating @entity137 , who played @entity139 rugby for the @entity141 island nation while serving as a soldier			2
later , the pair met and the former @entity145 back - rower convinced the younger man to chase his rugby dream			1
encouraged : rather than forcing a choice between rugby and service , the army backs his sporting dream ‘ the dream of all @entity22 guys is to play rugby , ’ he said			1
‘ kids play it everywhere			2
if they have a ball , they are lucky			0
if they do n’t have a ball , they improvise and use bottles or a shoe			0
i played with my mates and boys in the village			0
’ the hobby developed into something far more substantial within the structure of the @entity17			1
his innate talent quickly opened doors			0
first came under 23 and sevens selection , for tournaments all around the world , then @entity9 was introduced to the 15 - a - side game			1
his breakthrough came when he played for the @entity17 against @entity177 in @entity178 , catching the eye of @entity180 and @entity181			1
the coaches brought him to the @entity183 for a trial , then after moving to @entity25 , they again gave him a chance , which he took			2
when the call came to say he was being signed up , he did n’t believe it			0
‘ i thought it was a joke , ’ he said			2
‘ i was back in @entity192 , where my unit is based , after my trial			0
@entity180 called me and said , “ @entity196 , we want to offer you a one - year deal ”			2
i said , “ no. shut up			0
who is this ? ” he said it was @entity180 and i said , “ no it is n’t ” and hung up ! ’ hard yards : from the parks of @entity22 to @entity204 , @entity9 was spotted by the now @entity25 coaches in @entity192 now in his first full season for the @entity207 , he has shown sufficient prowess to interest the @entity27 management			1
@entity22 made enquiries , but after playing for the @entity211 earlier this year , @entity9 has set his sights on wearing the @entity213 in a test match			1
his chance may come as soon as next month , on the tour of @entity217			0
he added : ‘ my boss in the @entity17 said , “ you ’ve been playing really well , soon @entity27 or @entity22 will come knocking at your door ”			1
@entity22 tried to contact me , but i ’d rather wait to see if i can play for @entity27			2
there are loads of @entity22 players at home who are better than me			0
’ before @entity9 contemplates more national service , there are pressing club matters to focus on			1
on saturday , @entity25 face @entity230 at @entity231 and a place in the play - offs is on the line			1
for the soldier in the visitors ’ ranks , this is a shoot - out that will hold no fear			2
for players hoping to earn @entity139 selection , unsure if they will make the cut , the suspense must be hard to cope with			0
well , that wo n’t be an issue for @entity247 candidates later this month			0
final look : @entity249 will name his @entity247 team for @entity251 after a @entity254 v @entity253 match @entity255 is out for four to six weeks with ankle damage , says @entity145 boss @entity257 , and is likely to miss @entity27 ’s tour of @entity217 the @entity259 on thursday confirmed a @entity254 trial match at the @entity261 in @entity262 on may 30 , with @entity263 and @entity264 taking charge of the respective teams			1
many of the 46 players will be pretty certain of their selection for the @entity251 tour already , but others on the fringes wo n’t have a long wait to find out			0
@entity249 will name his tour party at the post-match press conference , so some contenders will be given good news while they ’re still getting changed			0
@entity279 is retiring , taking the game ’s most iconic , caveman beard with him			0
in his pomp , ‘ sea - bass ’ was a force of nature - giving his best years to sale as a no 8 whose swashbuckling ball - carrying feats illuminated the @entity290 game			2
@entity292 , his coach at the time , once delivered this assessment of his qualities : ‘ we use science to build rugby machines and he just smashes them			0
’ hero : @entity302 flanker @entity279 retires after an eventful career , finished by helping @entity304 to promotion best years : @entity302 legend @entity279 gave some of his greatest performances to @entity308 in the @entity27 @entity2 at the 2007 @entity309 , he became the darling of @entity302 , even when not in the starting team			1
the sight of him staring down the @entity313 before the quarter - final victory over the @entity315 in @entity316 will live in the memory , as will the surprising image of @entity279 driving to and from training in a smart car			0
occasionally prone to drifting out of games , he could be a moody character , but on his day he was majestic ; a truly @entity323 hero			1
it certainly was n’t dull , was it ? last weekend ’s round of six @entity2 matches yielded 45 tries as the elite clubs made hay in the sun. it was further proof that the notion of summer rugby - as frequently championed by this column - makes sense			1
the weather and the glorious attacking fare draw crowds and generate excitement			0
try feast : @entity344 ' @entity343 scores in their win over @entity177 , one of 45 @entity2 tries in the round free - flowing : the impressive sunshine scorelines advocate top level rugby in @entity27 being played in summer those against a calendar shift argue that it would rob the sport of variety , always producing fast - and - loose games and no attritional , forward - dominated contests			1
there is nothing to stop teams with an advantage up front from driving in scrums and mauls under blue skies			0
in fact , dry surfaces aid that facet of the game			0
studs can grip better when turf does n’t give way			0
playing when the conditions are better merely promotes strategic choice and the use of essential skills			0
those who hanker for mud and gloom are losing their footing in this perennial debate .			0

@entity9 , 26 , will line up for @entity25 in their play - off decider at @entity230
