no jail : judge @entity8 is facing calls to be removed from her position after she handed out a remarkably lenient sentence of 10 years probation to @entity2 who killed four people while on a drunken joyride last year judge @entity29 sentenced a 14 - year old boy to prison for killing one person with a powerful punch			1
the teenage suspect ’s name was never made public since he was prosecuted as a juvenile			0
' just after 10 p.m. on october 6 , the teen was riding in a @entity38 with two friends when he suddenly jumped out of the vehicle in the 1700 block of @entity42 and punched [ @entity44 ] @entity43 , who was 5 - foot - 1 and weighed 106 pounds , ' said the @entity46 district attorney ’s office in a statement			2
' @entity43 ’s head struck the pavement and he died two days later			0
' the 14 - year - old boy admitted to the crime and never expressed remorse for the murder , according to prosecutors			2
@entity43 ’s mother , @entity55 , said she remembers judge @entity29 pushing for rehabilitation , much like in the @entity2 case			1
no jail : @entity2 pictured here in december , avoided prison for killing four and injuring two more after his attorney argued that he was mollycoddled by his parents so much that he did n't understand the difference between right and wrong ' she wanted to send him to one of these special places in @entity67 , but no one would take him , ' @entity55 told @entity69			2
we just could n't believe it			0
the district attorney and i were just sitting on pins and needles			0
but , when nobody would take him , [ it was ] a sigh of relief			0
' @entity55 said she 's still disgusted at her experience with the judge			2
' she 's too easy on them , ' @entity55 said			0
' i do n't think she needs to be sitting on that bench			0
' @entity29 is expected to retire next year , but a petition has been launched at @entity85 demanding that @entity87 governor @entity86 remove her from the bench immediately			1
instead of prison , @entity2 is set to spend time at the swanky @entity93 male residential rehabilitation center in @entity94 with his parents footing the bill ' this sentence is a slap in the face [ of ] the families of those who were killed			1
he 's sent to @entity94 to a spa - type center while the families of the victims get to go to a cemetery , ' wrote a supporter of the petition , @entity106 of @entity87			1
' this is another disgusting display of the wealthy trying to change the rules when they break them			0
this judge should be removed for aiding a murderer , ' noted another supporter , @entity113 of @entity114 , @entity115 the relatives of one of the seven friends who were piled into @entity2 ’s pickup truck have spoken out about the ‘ living hell ’ they have been in since the accident six months ago			1
@entity122 was in the back of a pickup truck being driven erratically by @entity2 when he slammed into four people on the side of a road			1
those four people - a young woman whose car had broken down , a @entity131 trying to help , and a mother and daughter who also got out to see what they could do - were all killed			2
forever changed : @entity122 , now 16 , was in a coma following the june accident but now has been transferred home and has been awarded a $ 2 million settlement by a court in @entity87 heartbreaking : @entity122 now must be cared for by his mother @entity141 ( left ) and older brother @entity142 ( right ) around the clock and they have already accrued $ 1million in medical bills expensive : @entity146 ( left ) had to quit his job to help care for his brother and the family has already accrued more than a million dollars in medical bills since the accident in june 2013 @entity122 , who is now 16 , is still alive but has a completely different existence than he did before the accident as he is paralyzed , ‘ minimally conscious ’ and needs constant medical attention			1
speaking to @entity155 , @entity122 ’s older brother @entity146 said that doctors warned them of getting their hopes too high			2
‘ that ’s all we can hope for , is how he is now for the rest of his life , ’ @entity146 said			0
he attended @entity2 ’s trial in place of his brother , who can barely move without assistance			0
when the judge handed down a sentence of 10 years ’ probation and no jail time for the crash , @entity146 said that he had trouble processing his anger			1
he said he was ‘ disappointed , so outrageously angry that i could n’t say anything ’			0
his mother , @entity141 , still breaks down in tears when thinking about all of @entity122 ’s dreams that seem so far out of reach in light of the accident			2
drunk : @entity2 's blood alcohol reading was .24 and he also had a valium in his system when he killed four people and injured several more on june 15 ‘ he was the best son , he was the kind of boy who had a lot of dreams , ’ @entity146 said			1
‘ he was his first dream was to be a soccer player			0
’ @entity122 ’s family estimates that they have accrued more than $ 1million in medical bills over the past six months , and they are now suing @entity2 ’s family and his father ’s business - the car that the boys were in was owned by the company - for up to $ 20million			1
before : @entity122 had dreams of playing professional soccer before the accident ‘ that kid killed four people and crippled my little brother and does n’t even have to serve one year ? if he were poor like us , he would ’ve gotten 10 years , i bet , ’ @entity146 told the @entity204			1
they are not the first victims relatives to speak out in light of the controversial ruling , as @entity212 , who lost his wife @entity213 and 21 - year - old daughter @entity214 in the accident said he is dissatisfied with the easy sentence , and thinks @entity2 should have been tried as an adult			1
since he was tried as a juvenile , @entity2 faced a maximum of 20 years in prison but would have been eligible for parole after two years			2
' you look at 180 years of future life taken from the four individuals ... even a two year deal , a two year sentence before he 's eligible for parole , did n't seem exactly fair under those circumstances , ' @entity225 said			2
additionally upsetting to @entity225 is the fact that @entity2 will receive his counseling at a ' country club ' - style treatment center - with a pricetag of $ 450,000 per year and features equine therapy and organic menu options - in ritzy @entity237 , @entity94			1
the fatal accident occurred around 11:45pm on june 15 , @entity2 and a group his friends who were all drunk , got into a red @entity242 pick - up and were speeding 70 mph in a 40 mph zone when the truck left the road			1
as it careered out of control , it clipped a broken down @entity248 , throwing the owner and four good samaritans , who were trying to help , 60 yards in the air			0
youth pastor @entity253 , mother and daughter @entity213 and @entity255 and 24 - year - old @entity256 were all killed on impact			0
it was revealed soon after that @entity2 's blood - alcohol level was 0.24 - three times the adult limit , though minors are n't allowed any alcohol in their system - and that he was also on the prescription drug @entity265 when he started the chain reaction of crashes			1
the impact flung the four people 50 to 60 yards , authorities reported			0
speaking out : @entity212 , the father and husband of two women killed in a june drunk driving accident , is n't pleased that the teen driver got off with just a 10 year probation sentence killed : @entity277 , 52 , and her daughter , @entity255 , 21 , were helping out the driver of a broken down suv when they were struck and killed by @entity2 's out - of - control pickup victims : @entity256 , and @entity253 , 41 , were both killed in the horrific crash a psychologist called by the defense , dr @entity284 , blamed the teen 's behavior on his parents , claiming they gave him whatever he wanted including ' freedoms no young person should have '			1
dr @entity284 called @entity2 a product of ' affluenza , ' where his family felt their wealth bought privilege and there was no rational link between behavior and consequences			1
he added that the boy had an ' intellectual age ' of 18 but an ' emotional age ' of 12			0
' the teen never learned to say that you ’re sorry if you hurt someone , ' dr @entity284 said , according to the @entity308			0
' if you hurt someone , you sent him money			0
' state district judge @entity8 appeared to agree with the defense			1
she told the teen that he is responsible for what happened , but she said she did n't believe he would receive the therapy he needed in jail			0
if he violates the terms of his probation , he could be sent to prison for 10 years			1

' he 'll be feeling the hand of @entity343 , definitely , ' she told @entity69			0
' he may think he got away with something , but he has n't gotten away with anything			0
