a judge busted for sending a nearly nude picture of himself to a married court bailiff has defiantly admitted sexting the same snap to a string of other women			1
@entity6 , a specialist in sex misconduct cases on @entity9 's @entity8 , nonchalantly batted away claims the seedy semi-naked shower pictures sent by mobile phone was ' totally inappropriate '			1
when approached by @entity12 , he said : ' hot dog , yep that 's me			1
i 've got no shame in my game			0
i ai n't talking to nobody else 's wife			1
you can almost get that here and now			0
there 's nothing nude about it			2
i 'm in no more clothes than i 'll be at the y this afternoon when i swim my mile			0
' @entity6 , who 's appeared on the channel 's let it rip show preaching self - respect , has played down the incident			1
it is reminiscent of former congressman @entity44 's spectacular fall from grace and a plot - line from new spies - in - the - @entity48			1
but his seemingly arrogant stance has angered his colleague 's husband			2
the court bailiff 's spouse said : ' it 's totally inappropriate			2
it says a lot that he 's flawed			2
questions : @entity44 lost his post as @entity60 after sending nearly nude pictures of himself to women over @entity63 under fire : @entity44 initially denied the accusations but eventually admitted to sending the pictures ' he 's not what he appears to be , at least not to the general public because he has access to kids , he has access to different charitable functions			1
' he 's been looked upon as some great figure but , as you can see according to the picture , you see what he 's really all about			2
' what kind of man would send this to a married woman , knowing he 's a married man himself ? ' @entity12 legal analyst @entity82 claimed @entity6 would ' probably ' now lose his job - in echoes of former congressman @entity85 who was forced to resign in june last year			1
he said : ' if you take your cell phone and you send naked pictures to people that 's called sexting			0
echoes : a similar storyline of a congressman being busted for sexting to younger women appears in drama homeland , starring @entity98 as @entity99 ( left ) and @entity100 as @entity101 ( right ) ' high school kids do it these days , i was n't aware that judges do it too			1
i mean it 's borderline criminal ... and weird			0
' jokingly , @entity82 later admitted the judge was ' pretty fit ' but then questioned ' what exactly he was fit for '			0
@entity110 quit after it emerged he sent a lewd photograph to a 21 - year - old woman in @entity114 over @entity63			0
although he initially denied the accusations , he eventually admitted to sending the picture - and others before and after his marriage			0
his wife @entity119 , a @entity120 aide , stood by him throughout the scandal			0
the scandal recently resurfaced when it was mirrored in @entity125 's spy - drama homeland - where a politician was ousted for also texting nude pictures of himself to young women			1
the bailiff 's husband said they were now filing a complaint with the prosecutor and the @entity134 .			0
