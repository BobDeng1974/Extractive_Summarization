a simple probiotic pill that ' rewires ' the body could cure both types of diabetes , scientists claim			1
the new drug , which contains live bacteria from the human gut , has been shown to drastically lower blood sugar levels			1
the pancreas is the organ which controls glucose levels in the body in healthy individuals			1
but scientists at @entity15 in @entity16 discovered a protein secreted from a human probiotic could shift that control from the pancreas to the upper intestine			1
professor @entity39 , who led the new research , said their findings are a ' proof of principle ' which could prove the first step to developing a cure			0
he told the @entity46 : ' if it works really well in people , it could be that they just take the pill and would n't have to do anything else to control their diabetes			0
' it 's likely , though , that it will be used in conjunction with some other treatment			0
' diabetes is a life - long health condition where there is too much glucose in the blood because the body can not use it properly			2
the pancreas of a diabetes sufferer is unable to produce any insulin , or not enough			0
it can also be the case the insulin produced is unable to work properly			0
insulin is essential to the body , acting as the key that unlocks the door to the body 's cells so glucose can enter and provide energy			0
with diabetes , the body is unable to use glucose as fuel and instead glucose builds up in the blood			2
professor march 's team engineered a strain of lactobacillus , a human probiotic commonly found in the gut , to secrete a peptide - a hormone that releases insulin in response to food entering the body			1
the scientists then gave a group of diabetic rats the probiotic in pill form for a period of 90 days			1
they monitored the rats ' blood glucose levels , comparing their findings with a control group of rats , not exposed to the probiotic pill			1
the researchers found the treatment ' rewired ' the bodies of diabetic rats , shifting control of blood sugar levels from the pancreas , highlighted , to the upper intestine the team found those rats given the new drug had blood glucose levels which were up to 30 per cent lower than those rats not given the modified probiotic treatment			1
but another finding proved just as exciting			0
the scientists found the cells in the upper intestine of the diabetic rats given the treatment were converted into cells that acted similarly to pancreatic cells - which in healthy people secrete insulin to maintain and balance glucose levels			1
professor march , from the university 's @entity129 , said : ' the amount of time to reduce glucose levels following a meal is the same as in a normal rat , and it is matched to the amount of glucose in the blood			2
' it is moving the centre of glucose control from the pancreas to the upper intestine			1
' professor march said while the probiotic treatment replaced the insulin capacity in diabetic rats , in those free of the condition the researchers found no change in blood glucose levels , when the treatment was administered			1
' if the rat is managing its glucose , it does n't need more insulin , ' he added			0
professor march said the next step would be to test higher doses of the treatment to establish if the probiotic could reverse the condition altogether			1
he said if successful , the probiotic could then be made into a pill that diabetic patients would take each morning to help control their condition			0
the probiotic lactobacillus is already used and approved as a treatment for diarrhoea , irritable bowel syndrome and crohn 's disease , among other conditions			0
the study , published in the journal @entity172 , was funded by the @entity173 and the @entity174			0
@entity175 , from @entity176 , said : ' this study focused on rats , and years of further research including clinical trials in humans will be needed before we know if the probiotic used would have the same benefits in people , or if it could become a routine treatment for people living with diabetes			2
' it is especially important to note that the probiotic used in the study is different to the probiotic dairy products that are already widely available			0
' currently , the best way to manage diabetes is by taking existing medications prescribed by your doctor , and maintaining a healthy weight by following a healthy balanced diet and taking regular exercise			0
' type 1 diabetes type 1 develops when the insulin - producing cells in the body have been destroyed , leaving the body unable to produce any insulin at all			1
everyone diagnosed with type 1 is treated with insulin			2
scientists do n't know why the insulin - producing cells are destroyed in people with the condition			0
all those diagnosed with type 1 diabetes are treated with insulin , pictured it is thought to be caused by an abnormal , autoimmune , reaction to the cells , which could be triggered by a virus or other infection			1
experts believe there is a genetic element to type 1 diabetes			2
it is more common in some parts of the world than others			0
unlike type 2 , type 1 diabetes has nothing to do with lifestyle or weight			1
the condition can develop at any age , but is usually diagnosed before the age of 40 , most commonly in late childhood			0
around 10 per cent of the 2.9 million people diagnosed with diabetes in the @entity235 have type 1			1
type 2 diabetes the condition develops when the body is still able to make insulin , but not enough			1
it also develops when the insulin that is produced by the body does not work properly - known as insulin resistance			0
initially , type 2 diabetes can be controlled with a healthy diet and regular exercise			1
being obese or overweight is the biggest risk factor for developing type 2 diabetes medication is also often required and a large number of sufferers eventually progress to needing insulin			2
people who are overweight and have a large waist , are more likely to be diagnosed with type 2 diabetes - it is the biggest risk factor			2
those who have a close relative with the condition , or who are from a black or @entity262 background are also at increased risk			0
the condition usually affects those aged over 40 , but people from @entity262 are commonly affected from the age of 25			0
around 90 per cent of the 2.9 million people diagnosed with diabetes in the @entity235 have type 2			2

researchers at @entity15 discovered a probiotic , commonly found in the human gut , can ' rewire ' the body to help combat diabetes
it shifted control of blood sugar levels from pancreas to the upper intestine
pancreas controls glucose levels by secreting insulin in healthy people
in diabetics the organ produces no insulin or not enough of the hormone
treatment lowered diabetic rats ' blood glucose levels by up to 30 *%*
scientists say higher doses could reverse both type 1 and 2 diabetes
