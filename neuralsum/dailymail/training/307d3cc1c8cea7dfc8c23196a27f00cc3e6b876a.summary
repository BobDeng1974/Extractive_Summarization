a couple have revealed how they lost an incredible 280lbs combined , with the motivation of being a positive influence for their four daughters			1
in 2011 , @entity6 and @entity7 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , had long neglected their health , with @entity6 weighing 327lbs and @entity7 tipping the scales at 287lbs			1
but in march 2012 , just before @entity14 turned 30 , they decided it was finally time to make a change , both for their own well - being and for the sake of their young children			1
before ... : in 2011 , @entity6 and @entity7 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , tipped the scales at 327lbs and 287lbs respectively ( pictured )			1

and it 's all thanks to their children			1
' it got to the point where we realized it did n't matter what we fed them , ' @entity41 explained to @entity47			2
' if we were n't eating the same way or if we were overeating , they were going to follow our example			2
' for @entity41 and @entity14 , being obese was a downward spiral ; @entity14 , disheartened by the mean comments she got about her weight , would turn to food for comfort			2
and @entity41 was always too exhausted to play with his kids , so he 'd lounge around and eat instead			2
in 2012 , after they had had several fruitless conversations over the years about making a change , @entity14 finally decided that enough was enough			2
transformation : @entity41 began making small changes - like playing tennis and turning down seconds at dinner			1
( pictured left , before his weight loss , and right , after completing his first marathon in may ) a whole new woman : these days , @entity14 is down an amazing 120lbs , has shrunk from a size 24 to a size 10 and is happier than ever ' there was that point i hated myself so much			2
i was n't giving them the full me because i was disgusted , ' she said of her family			0
' you have to look in the mirror and say , " am i going to allow this to continue or am i going to stand up and make those changes ? " a light turned on upstairs			0
' ' i hated myself so much			0
i was n't giving them the full me because i was disgusted ' so in 2012 , @entity14 , who works in a bank , enrolled in @entity84 classes			0
within just weeks , she had dropped 14lbs , and she began exercising even more regularly			0
even though @entity41 was more averse to the idea of exercise , calling the idea of going for a run ' unappealing to the point of agony , ' he , too , began making small changes - like taking up tennis and turning down seconds at dinner			1
family matters : ' there was that point i hated myself so much , ' @entity14 ( pictured with @entity41 and their daughters ) said of her motivation to get healthy			0
' i was n't giving them the full me because i was disgusted ' step by step , the couple and their children began doing more and more physical activities together , taking advantage of the @entity9 outdoors with hiking trips and swimming excursions			1
the parents kept track of their diets with calorie - counting apps , and began cooking meals together rather than ordering or eating out			1
by december , @entity41 was ready for his first @entity117 race			0
although he finished way behind his wife , this first experience of physical competition motivated him to make even more changes			0
today , the father - of - four has completed a second @entity117 , a @entity124 race and a marathon , and he has shed an incredible 160lbs			1
in it together : in december 2012 , the couple ran their first race - a local @entity131 ' ( pictured )			1
@entity14 finished ahead of @entity41 , but the race motivated both of them to move forward and focus on their health what a difference a year makes : in december 2013 they ran the same race			0
@entity41 , who was down 140lbs by then , improved on the previous year 's results by an incredible 14 minutes @entity14 , who is down an amazing 120lbs , has shrunk from a size 24 to a size 10 and is happier than ever			0
' we realized if we were overeating , our kids were going to follow our example ' not only are they proud to be great role models for their kids , but they have a new appreciation for themselves and each other , too			0
i like what i 'm seeing in the mirror , ' said @entity14			0
' i know there 's some work to still be done , but i 'm such a different person than i was before , ' she added .			0

in 2011 , parents - of - four @entity6 and @entity7 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , tipped the scales at 327lbs and 287lbs respectively
today , thanks to a new passion for fitness and a vegan diet , the avid runners both weigh 167lbs
