by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 not only did @entity2 finish above @entity3 last season , they very nearly finished above everyone else			1
three points , ultimately , was the difference between second position and a first title in 24 years			0
the traditional tussle with their city rivals had long since been settled , the @entity13 running red for the first time in three seasons			2
but will @entity17 again exert @entity19 's authority over @entity20 and the @entity21 ? the departure of @entity2 's @entity23 and subsequent return of @entity25 at @entity3 has blown open the debate heading into the new season			1
@entity45 was poised to join until he failed a medical at the weekend and another striker is top of the agenda			2
but their recruitment thus far has been impressive			0
forget any argument over value for money – fees are almost an irrelevance for the top clubs – the players they have brought in have undoubtedly strengthened @entity17 ' squad			0
@entity60 is proven @entity62 quality and will add craft as well as graft to the starting @entity65 former @entity67 comrade @entity66 is a shrewd acquisition who , if used sparingly as expected , will be desperate to impact when called upon			2
another @entity70 who marched out of @entity72 's in the direction of @entity19 is @entity74 , and his influence at the back could yet prove the most telling			0
new recruit : @entity2 signed @entity67 captain @entity60 for £ 25million in july @entity78 amplifies options in the middle of the park but it is the signing of @entity83 which excites more than the others			1
fans love something of the unknown and the 20 - year - old @entity87 – blessed with a turn of foot and locker full of tricks - could well be the surprise package of the @entity62 season			1
but with that , of course , comes the risk of a settling - in period , given his tender years he would be forgiven as much			0
at @entity3 , however , the re-signing of @entity100 and @entity25 – last season 's loanees – comes with no such danger			1
@entity25 scored 16 times last year , plundering 17 the season before at @entity105			1
many have baulked at a fee which will rise to £ 28m , but do n't forget this boy only turned 21 in may			0
completing @entity3 's new arrivals is @entity110 , the 21 - year - old @entity111 midfielder who signed for £ 4m from @entity112			1
tidy , tireless and tenacious – as he showed at the @entity115 – the prospect of him , @entity100 and @entity116 forming a midfield triumvirate is an exciting one			0
back to stay : @entity100 ( centre ) has also made his move to @entity3 permanent after a loan spell the @entity122 as much as we may celebrate @entity2 's new signings , they have , of course , arrived to the backdrop of @entity23 's departure			1
and , putting aside bites and bans , to take away 31 goals leaves a huge void – just look at @entity133 and the effect @entity136 's absence had on their subsequent campaign			0
for no matter the fee received or the manner of its reinvestment , you simply can not replace @entity23			2
you can try to compensate for his loss and that is what @entity17 will do , but there will be points lost this season from matches in which @entity23 would have salvaged at least one and often three			1
@entity3 , meanwhile , have lost none of their key players			2
moreover , they have secured the long - term future of @entity156 and kept @entity157 at @entity158			0
huge blow : @entity2 will be without @entity23 next season following his £ 75million move to @entity162 young gun : @entity3 's talented midfielder @entity156 ( right ) recently signed a new four - year - deal the @entity166 new signings , naturally , will take centre stage when the action gets underway			1
but , invariably , it is those already in residence who make the difference			0
@entity3 have a stellar blue - chip brigade ; @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity157 , @entity116 and @entity179			2
likewise , however , @entity2 ; @entity180 , @entity182 @entity181 , @entity183 and @entity184 the @entity186 quintet who were central to their title tilt last term			0
in fact , it is hard to pick weakness when assessing their respective squads			0
a composite xi , you feel , would make for one helluva good side			0
repeat performance ? @entity184 ( left ) scored 21 league goals for runners - up @entity2 last season the managers there is no need to separate analysis of this pair ; young , bright , innovative , fearless , shrewd and respected			2
there you have it , both clubs should have no worries over the men at the helm			0
thumbs up : @entity20 has proven a success as @entity3 boss following his debut campaign the commitments both enter @entity218 competition at the group stage – @entity2 the @entity220 , @entity3 the @entity221			1
that means the guarantee of six midweek fixtures and – were they to make it all the way to the final – a further seven matches for @entity2 and nine for @entity3			1
it is thought that @entity2 's unlikely title shot last season was aided by their absence from @entity233			2
the addition of such strain this time around is the reason why many observers have already written off their @entity62 aspirations			2
@entity3 , of course , did not have to worry about continental distraction last year either and the @entity221 – with its thursday - sunday pattern – has historically had a worse effect on a team 's domestic season than the @entity220			1
food for thought ? @entity17 will have to balance @entity2 's domestic and @entity218 ambitions the fixtures the first two visitors to @entity158 are @entity250 and @entity40			0
daunting or a chance to put down an early marker ? they did , do not forget , beat @entity40 early last season and kicked off with a home victory over @entity256 12 months previous			0
the first @entity258 derby arrives as early as september 27 at @entity19 , and @entity3 travel to @entity259 on the back of it			1
@entity2 , meanwhile , open at home to @entity67 but are then handed away days at champions @entity263 and @entity133			0
a title can not be won in august , but a few bruising defeats can leave you licking your wounds and off the pace			0
tough start : @entity3 face @entity250 ( both pictured ) and @entity40 in their opening @entity62 fixtures the verdict twelve points was the difference between the rivals last season			1
@entity2 , minus @entity23 and with the added exertion of @entity233 , will not , you suspect , better their tally			1
@entity3 , with a settled squad and the permanent addition of @entity25 , should improve			1
still , however , you would back the @entity43 to shade it and finish on top in the battle of @entity35			2
either way , it promises to make for an intriguing season once more			0
bragging rights : @entity2 finished above @entity3 for the first time in three years last season			1

@entity28 assesses which @entity258 club will come out on top in the @entity62 next season
@entity2 finished above @entity3 for the first time in three seasons last year
