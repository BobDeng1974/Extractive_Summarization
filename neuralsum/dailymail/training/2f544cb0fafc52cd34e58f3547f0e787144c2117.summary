a 1,000 - year - old sculpture which was used in recent years as a tombstone for a cat has been bought by a museum for £ 150,000			1
the @entity5 limestone relief depicting @entity6 was originally discovered at a quarry in @entity8 by @entity9 , a stonemason			1
he took it home and used it to mark the grave of his tabby @entity16 , whom he had adopted as a stray , at the bottom of his garden			0
discovery : this @entity5 carving was used as a gravestone for a cat before its significance was realised inspiration : historian @entity26 spotted the carving and told its owner what it was worth but when mr @entity9 died , a historian examined the monument and realised that it was in fact a rare artwork dating back to the 10th or 11th century			1
it was bought by a private collector 10 years ago - but now it will go on public display after it was acquired by the @entity39 for £ 150,000 , with half of the money coming from a lottery grant			1
no one knows exactly where mr @entity9 found the stone , but it is thought to have come from a local church such as @entity45 , which is dedicated to @entity6 and @entity46			1
experts have suggested that it could have been part of the church 's architecture , perhaps mounted next to the altar			0
the work would originally have been painted , and the deep holes in the figure 's eyes imply that they would once have been filled with blue glass or a similar material			0
purchase : the monument , which shows @entity6 , has now been bought for £ 150,000 by a local museum home : for years it was located in the garden of this house , where it marked the grave of a pet cat local historian @entity26 was the first person to appreciate the carving 's value when he passed the home where mr @entity9 's widow was living			1
' i was walking past the house one day and saw it in the front garden and knew immediately i was looking at something special , ' he said			0
' i knocked on the front door , spoke to the owners and told them , " i think you 've just won the lottery			0
" ' the artwork was originally sold at @entity82 's 10 years ago for £ 175,000 to @entity83 , an @entity84 collector			2
after mr @entity83 died in 2011 , the carving came up for sale again - and this time the museum was able to raise the funds to buy it			1
snapped up : the sculpture will now live in the @entity39 , based in @entity91 , pictured @entity92 , head of museums for the @entity94 , said : ' we were keen at the time to acquire it for the museum , but the price was beyond us			2
' so when it recently came up for sale again we were determined to raise the money if we could			0
' digging around in the back garden is not just a relaxing hobby - for some lucky collectors , it can be extremely lucrative			2
two years ago , a couple from @entity107 realised that the stone trough they used to plant flowers in was in fact a @entity113 coffin ( above ) valued by experts at £ 100,000			1
more @entity113 remains were discovered in the garden of an archaeological school in @entity118 in 2012 , and turned out to be a theatre which would once have been able to hold 12,000 people			0
last year , @entity121 and @entity122 were shocked to find human skeletons ( right ) in their @entity125 garden while they were building an extension - and even more surprised to learn that they were the bodies of @entity130 pows captured during the @entity131			0
there have also been a number of 20th - century finds - in 2012 a homeowner in @entity8 found a 6ft - deep air raid shelter buried underneath his garden , and the next year a family realised that the oldest surviving garden swing in the world , dating back 90 years , was located in their back yard			1
perhaps the most bizarre discovery of all came in october 2013 , when @entity143 was told that a large bone he 'd found in @entity145 belonged to a 250million - year - old pliosaur , a sea creature related to dinosaurs			2
it will go on public display in the museum , based in @entity91 , from this saturday			0
historians say that despite the fragmentary nature of the sculpture , its high price tag is explained by the fact that few comparable carvings are in as good a condition			2
dr @entity160 , from the @entity161 , told @entity162 that the depiction of the saint was characteristically @entity165			0
' the carving is very fine , depicting a typically @entity5 image of @entity6 , in that he is beardless and tonsured - a convention paralled in many @entity5 manuscripts but unknown on the @entity170 , where he is bearded , ' she said			1
' @entity6 would usually have a key , but here he has a book - perhaps this is why his name was added to the image			2
' she suggested that the sculpture could once have been ' flanking the altar with the @entity179 on the other side ' , adding : ' his upward gaze perhaps is intended to guide the viewer 's eyes towards @entity185 in majesty			0
' dr @entity187 of the @entity188 added : ' it 's important because it 's such high quality , and because comparatively little @entity5 sculpture survives from @entity8 and the @entity192 generally - despite there having been many important @entity5 churches there			1
' at the time of the original sale , a @entity82 's spokesman said : ' the relief is made from @entity201 limestone and is incredibly rare , as few reliefs of this period have survived , time normally having worn the surface detail away			0
' the carving is believed to have originally been a section of a cross shaft , or part of a larger panel - the figure of @entity6 is clearly visible			1
' it is a rare survivor of @entity165 stone carving at its best and draws strong parallels to the ninth and 10th centuries			0
' the sculpture dates from around the time of the @entity219 invasion of @entity165 , when @entity220 was forced to hide in the @entity8 marshes before rallying his troops and taking back his kingdom .			2

a stonemason found the carving in a quarry and used it as a tombstone
after he died , a historian realised that it was in fact a rare sculpture of @entity6 dating back 1,000 years
the well - *preserved* carving may have come from a church in @entity8
it has now been bought by a local museum for £ 150,000 after a decade in private ownership
