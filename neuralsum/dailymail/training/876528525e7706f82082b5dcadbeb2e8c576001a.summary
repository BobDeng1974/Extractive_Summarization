from admiring @entity2 's intelligence to cooing over the puppies in @entity4 , experts have found that films significantly influence the popularity of dog breeds chosen as pets			1
and the effect can last for up to a decade , with the general success of the films mirroring the amount of a specific breed purchased			1
for example , the 1943 blockbuster @entity14 triggered a 40 per cent increase of collie registrations over the following two years			1
the effect of doggie films such as @entity20 and @entity2 ( pictured ) can effect the breeds of dogs that owners choose as pets for up to 10 years after their release , a study claims			1
these graphs show how @entity28 , collies , @entity4 and other breeds soared in popularity after people saw the films ( pictured right )			2
many people bought @entity35 after seeing @entity36 , but their popularity was short - lived an even more dramatic example was the 100-fold increase in @entity41 registrations following the 1959 @entity43 movie @entity20			1
the influence of films on people ’s choice of dog was strongest in the early 20th century and has since declined - but people still rushed out to buy @entity51 dogs after the 1992 film @entity36			1
researchers used data from the @entity55 - which maintains the world ’s largest dog registry totalling over 65 million dogs - for their study			1
they looked at 87 films featuring dogs , @entity20 , @entity14 , @entity4 , @entity62 and @entity36			1
the scientists found that the release of films is often associated to an increase in popularity of featured breeds over periods of one , two , five and ten years			2
however , some films bucked the trend , with the number of people choosing @entity74 , for example falling after seeing the original version of @entity77 this graph shows how the top 10 films affected the purchase of @entity81 among other breeds and how the overall influence of films lessens over the years the number of people choosing @entity4 as pets soared dramatically as shown in this graph from the study ( pictured left ) after the release of the film in 1985 ( illustration pictured right ) scinetists found the 1943 blockbuster @entity14 triggered a 40 per cent increase of @entity96 registrations over the following two years			1
a still from the 2005 @entity2 film is pictured the was the 100-fold increase in @entity41 registrations following the 1959 @entity43 movie @entity20			1
the poster for the recent re-make is pictured left and an image of the breed , right they also discovered that the trends correlated with the how many people had seen the film on its opening weekend			2
viewing a movie may cause a long - lasting preference for a breed that can be expressed years later , when the time comes to buy a new dog , the study suggests			1
the research was carried out by scientists from the @entity119 , the @entity120 , and @entity121 and published in the journal @entity123			2
the 10 films with the strongest effect over a decade saw more than 800,000 dogs in total registered in the decade after their breed starred in a popular film			1
‘ we focused on changes in trend popularity rather than on popularity itself to avoid attributing to movies trends that were already ongoing before movie release , as up - trending breeds may have been chosen more often for movies , ’ study lead author professor @entity131 explained			2
the influence of films on people ’s choice of dog was strongest in the early 20th century and has since declined , but this graph shows the effect across the 87 films studied by the researchers , demonstrating that people are swayed by which breeds are popular in the media there was a vast rise in the number of @entity51 dogs chosen as pets in the five years following the popular film , @entity36 released in 1992 ( pictured left ) - but the trend declined again afterwards with only a slight rise in popularity for the breed shown in a decade ( pictured in the graph , right ) they looked at 87 films featuring dogs , @entity20 , @entity14 , @entity4 , @entity62 and @entity36			1
after cinema goers watched the original incredible journey in 1963 , the popularity of @entity167 ( pictured centre ) soared , while they fell after seeing the more modern version ( still pictured ) the team discovered a general decrease during the century of movies ’ influence on the success of dog breeds			1
earlier movies are associated with generally larger trend changes than later films and the researchers said this might be due to an increased competition with other media , such as television , and more recently , the internet , - but also increased competition among movies			0
movies featuring dogs were released at a rate of less than one per year until about 1940 , but a rate of more than seven per year by 2005			0
the researchers had previously shown how dynamics in dog breed popularity are subject to the ‘ erratic fluctuations ’ typical of fashion and fads			0
surprisingly , @entity77 ( film poster pictured left ) was among the movies that saw the popularity of certain breeds decrease			0
less people registered @entity74 ( @entity204 's breed ) as pets than they did before watching the original 1955 film viewing a movie may cause a long - lasting preference for a breed that can be expressed years later , when the time comes to buy a new dog , the study suggests			1
there have been a number of @entity4 films since the first was released in 161 and saw a huge rise in the popularity of the breed there has been a rise in the number of ' @entity219 ' dogs such as huskies up for adoption in pet rehoming centres			0
the trend has been blamed on the @entity229 films and @entity230 as people rushed out to buy a puppy , not realising how energetic the breeds can be			2
@entity234 , which cares for ill and abandoned pets , said the number of huskies and similar breeds taken to its 12 rehoming centres across the @entity240 had increased by 700 per cent over the past five years			2
animal charity @entity241 has a total of 34 @entity243 and @entity244 at its 19 rehoming centres			0
@entity246 , its head of training and behaviour , said yesterday : ‘ these dogs are beautiful creatures and can make wonderful companions , but they need owners who understand the demands of this breed and are in a position to offer a lifetime commitment			0
’ for example , they discovered that the more rapidly puppy registrations increased , the more rapidly their popularity declined , a phenomena also found for the popularity of baby names			0
the study demonstrated that the popularity of breeds is unrelated to breed temperament and health			0
@entity271 , co-author of the paper , said : ‘ on the whole , breeds with more desirable behaviours , greater longevity , and fewer inherited genetic disorders did not become more popular than other breeds			0
‘ in short , cultural shifts in types of pets largely reflect ephemeral changes in fashion rather than selection for functional traits			0
” dr @entity285 , of @entity119 , said : ‘ if people buy en masse dogs because they appear in movies the consequences can be negative for the dogs themselves			2
‘ our previous study found that the most popular breeds had the greatest number of inherited disorders			0
it ’s not surprising that we tend to follow social cues and fashions , as this is a quite effective strategy in many situations			0
‘ however , in particular cases the outcomes can be negative			0
when choosing a new pet , we may want to act differently			0
’ there has been a rise in the number of ' @entity219 ' dogs such as huskies up for adoption in pet rehoming centres and the trend has been blamed on the twilight films ( illustrated ) as well as tv series @entity230			0

effect can last for up to a decade and is correlated with the general success of the films , a study led by the @entity119 claims
the 1943 blockbuster @entity14 triggered a 40 per cent increase of @entity96 registrations over the following two years
an even more dramatic example was the 100-fold increase in @entity41 registrations following the 1959 @entity43 movie @entity20
the influence of films on people ’s choice of dog was strongest in the early 20th century and has since declined
