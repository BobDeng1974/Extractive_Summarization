it is always revealing to see how players respond to adversity and @entity3 has reacted magnificently to being left out of last year ’s @entity4			1
i can remember players left out when i played having a moan in the dressing room and spouting nonsense about how they did not fit in			2
what @entity3 has done is have a look at himself , stay quiet and then produce hundred after hundred to ensure he will not be left out in a hurry again			1
@entity3 showed plenty of grit , as well as talent , in yet another big innings for @entity18 @entity3 has bounced back from a difficult @entity19 to prove himself as a quality test batsman around four years ago i remember sitting next to @entity22 on a bus journey and him quietly telling me that the young @entity25 batsman to watch out for was @entity3			1
he was barely heard of then			0
how right @entity22 was , for what @entity3 has done since @entity27 speaks volumes about the character of the bloke			1
do not be fooled by the boyish grin and cheeky demeanour			0
he is as steely as they come , a fierce competitor who loves playing for @entity18			1
he tells himself every day that he must enjoy the game but that takes nothing away from the quality of his magnificent performances			0
his last five hundreds have been in excess of 149 , four of them have been unbeaten and in the way he batted with @entity44 yesterday he showed he has a very good cricket brain			2
and he has n’t messed with his form either			0
it would be easy in his current run to chip up a catch on 40 or give it away as soon as he reaches a hundred , as @entity51 did in the first innings here			1
i love the way @entity3 goes big			1
before his partner was foolishly run out , @entity3 showed maturity to bat with the tail on friday in @entity59 the young batsman has been superb in his middle - order role , and should not be moved up the batting card part of me sees @entity3 as a natural no 3 , where @entity18 tried him in @entity65			1
he looks like a batsman who could come in and regain the initiative if you lose an early wicket			0
but why move him when he is going so well at five ? keep him there			2
eventually he will captain @entity18 and five is a good place to captain from			1
the only problem in seeing him as a future @entity18 captain is that do we want to put our best player in charge when his runs are so important ? look at @entity81 and just about every @entity18 captain in history			2
it wears them all down in the end and when the day eventually comes that @entity18 need a new leader they will have to think about that			1
his fabulous form should be enough to see @entity3 left to do what he does best - score runs for @entity18 @entity81 ( right ) has shown the danger of making your best player the captain of the team i have enjoyed the battle between @entity100 and @entity51 in this test and i like the way the @entity104 lad goes about his cricket			1
the fact he gave @entity108 a send - off when he got him out in @entity65 speaks volumes for him and he ’ll never take a backward step			2
i generally do n’t like send - offs			0
once a batsman is out you have done your job so why point to the dressing room or swear at someone ? but i enjoyed what @entity51 did on the third evening			0
if you are going to do it , make it humorous and non-threatening like that salute			0
@entity100 will have to take it			2
if you dish it out you have to take it back			0
@entity126 should n’t go too far , though			0
i saw @entity127 take him to one side for a chat before play yesterday and that might have been to say : ‘ be careful			0
do n’t lose your passion but do n’t do anything stupid			0

@entity3 has been terrific to bounce back from a difficult time in @entity65
@entity3 ***'s*** ***182*** *** in the first innings in @entity59 showed he is a steely competitor
he looks a natural no 3 , but @entity18 should **n't** move him from current spot
the captaincy always wears players down , and it is **n't** his time yet
@entity100 is right to be passionate , but needs to keep his cool as well
