it is the supermodel look that many people aspire too , but it seems our early ancestors may have naturally had waif - like hips and thin legs			1
scientists examining a 1.9 million year old pelvis and femur have found that a now extinct species of early human had very different bodies to our own			1
the fossil is thought to belong to either @entity14 or homo habilis , two species of human ancestor that evolved in @entity18			1
the 1.9 million year old femur and pelvis above are thought to belong to @entity15 or @entity14 while scientists have long studied the different skull shapes and facial features of these species , they are now turning their attention to their bodies			1
according to research led by anthropologists at the @entity30 , these early @entity33 species far thinner narrow pelvises and thigh bones compared to our own species , @entity39 and another extinct human species @entity37			0
55 million years ago - first primitive primates evolve 15 million years ago - @entity42 ( great apes ) evolve from the ancestors of the gibbon 8 million years ago - first gorillas evolve			0
later , chimp and human lineages diverge 5.5 million years ago - @entity49 , early ‘ proto - human ’ shares traits with chimps and gorillas 4 million years ago - @entity51 appeared			0
they had brains no larger than a chimpanzee 's 2.7 million years ago - @entity55 , lived in woods and had massive jaws for chewing 2.8 million years ago - the first members of the @entity33 family appeared in @entity18 as shown by the @entity60 350 - 1 fossil discovered in @entity62 2.3 million years ago - @entity33 habalis is first thought to have appeared in @entity18 1.8 million years ago - @entity64 begins to appear in fossil record 1.6 million years ago - @entity67 axes become the first major technological innovation 800,000 years ago - early humans control fire and create hearths			2
brain size increases rapidly 400,000 years ago - @entity73 first begin to appear and spread across @entity74 and @entity75 200,000 years ago - @entity77 - modern humans - appear in @entity18 40,0000 years ago - modern humans reach @entity74 their hip joints , however , were very similar to modern humans - unlike in chimpanzees where the hip is much flatter and higher than in humans			0
this would have given these early humans an upright posture but with narrow hips and spindly legs			1
professor @entity88 , a pathologist at the @entity30 's school of medicine who studied the remains , said : ' what these new fossils are telling us is that the early species of our genus , @entity33 , were more distinctive than we thought			0
' they differed not only in their faces and jaws , but in the rest of their bodies too			0
' the old depiction of linear evolution from ape to human with single steps in between is proving to be inaccurate			0
' we are finding that evolution seemed to be experimenting with different human physical traits in different species before ending up with homo sapiens			2
' the fossilised pelvis and femur fossils were found at the @entity117 site on the eastern shore of @entity119 , in the @entity120 of @entity121			1
originally a fragment of a femur was discovered at the site in 1980 but a later excavation in 2009 revealed a new femur fragment and a piece of pelvis			0
scientists have now found that the femur fragments are part for the same leg and belong the the same individual as the pelvis			2
scientists have dated the fossils at around 1.9 million years old			0
as the oldest fossils of @entity37 to be found are 1.8 million years old , they concluded that the fossilised bones may belong to to one to two other early human species around at the time - @entity33 habilis or @entity14			1
the site where the fossil femur and pelvis were found is shown above along with when they were discovered the site where the fossil femur and pelvis were found was in @entity117 , within the @entity120 of @entity121 there are almost no skeletal pieces in the fossil record for these two species so the discovery has provided scientists a rare glimpse at how they may have looked			1
the researchers , whose study is published in the @entity154 , used ct scans of the fossilised pelvis and femur to compare them to those of other species of primate , early human and modern humans			1
they concluded that the skeletons of early human ancestors may have quite different structures to our own			2
most studies on how early @entity33 species would have looked have focused on the skull and facial features as can be seen in the above reconstruction of @entity15 ( left ) and the skull of @entity14 ( right ) professor @entity174 said : ' this new specimen has a hip joint like all other @entity33 species , but it also has a thinner pelvis and thighbone compared to @entity37			0
' this does n’t necessarily mean that these early human ancestors moved or lived differently , but it does suggest that they were a distinct species that could have been identified not just from looking at their faces and jaws , but by seeing their body shapes as well			1
' our new fossils , along with the other new specimens reported over the past few weeks , tell us that the evolution of our genus goes back much earlier than we thought , and that many species and types of early humans coexisted for about a million years before our ancestors became the only @entity33 species left			2

fossilised pelvis and femur from early human found in @entity120 , @entity121
scientists believe they belong to either @entity14 or homo habilis
the fossil femur and pelvis are far narrower than those of modern humans
this suggests our ancestors had thinner legs and hips than homo sapiens
the fossils show early humans had varied body shapes as well as skulls
