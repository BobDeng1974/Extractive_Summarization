after a entire month of awards ceremonies , the stars are clearly reaching the bottom of their red carpet wardrobes			0
at last night 's @entity5 , the celebrities fell foul of a whole host of fashion fails , including head - to - toe red lace , bright pink vinyl and ice skater - style dresses			1
and while many of the guests at the event at @entity18 's @entity17 such as @entity19 added a rock edge to their wardrobe , others fell into the trap of overdressing			1
some stars like @entity29 ( left ) overdressed for the event , while others like @entity32 ( centre ) opted for bizarre costumes that did n't quite work , and @entity35 ( right ) the brits are usually a safer event for singers , as they can dig into their smart - casual wardrobe to attend the ceremony , but clearly , stars like @entity29 and @entity42 did n't get the memo			1
the pair looked incredibly over-dressed in comparison to their musical counterparts , with @entity29 's outfit possibly being better at home at a gala dinner than one of the music industries coolest nights of the year			1
elsewhere , popstrels like @entity54 made the faux pas of displaying too much side - boob - the star left onlookers gasping with the acreage of chest on display as she took her turn on the red carpet			0
the clothes were n't the only area to take a hit , many of the guests also got a bit too enthusiastic with the curling tongs , like ms @entity29 , once again , and @entity70			1
and others simply did not dress up enough			0
@entity72 was spotted wearing a white shirt with a black and white spotted skirt which would have been the perfect outfit had she been heading to the office			0
read on to find out who made it on to @entity79 's worst dressed brits list this year ... @entity81 's shiny pink dress was like something out of a budget space age film and the skater shape of the frock did left us unexcited @entity88 's dress was elegant , but her @entity90 curly @entity89 do let her look down as the singer piled her hair on top of her head @entity29 's head of curls and floor - length red lace number was too much when put together @entity54 's dress left little to the imagination and had the added effect of appearing frumpy from the front @entity42 swamped her petite frame with too many layers covering her white dress in an over-sized kimono @entity72 wore a skirt and white shirt combo that would have looked better in the office than on the red carpet normally stylish @entity32 arrived in a bizarre outfit which featured a long dress with a bra detailed top over a pair of wide legged trousers @entity116 spring 2015 shop the designer at @entity118 visit site she might not be everyone 's fashion cup of tea , but we think @entity32 looks amazing			1
she 's one of the most exciting performers to watch , and her style gets people talking too			2
if you thought the musician 's own off - duty fashion was edgy , her red carpet looks always knock the sartorial ball right out of the park			1
yes we have a huge girl crush on her			0
here @entity135 is doing her thang of being totally badass as she dominates the brits red carpet in this dramatic @entity116 creation			0
the bondage-esque top teamed with the intricate embellished skirt overlay make the look the perfect fusion of high fashion and down right risky			2
we lusted after this ensemble during the spring 2015 shows , which means it is n't available to buy yet , but you can browse the current @entity116 offerings at @entity118 by clicking right			0
