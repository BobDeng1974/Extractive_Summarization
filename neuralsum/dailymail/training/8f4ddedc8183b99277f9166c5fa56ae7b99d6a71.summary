video footage of @entity2 prisoner @entity1 , who has been held at @entity3 since 2002 , will now be shown in court after challenges from his lawyers and news outlets a federal judge has ordered the public release of 28 videotapes of a hunger - striking @entity3 prisoner being forcibly removed from his cell and force - fed. lawyers for the prisoner , @entity1 , have challenged his treatment as abusive			1
numerous news media outlets , including the @entity17 , had asked the court on june 20 to unseal the videotapes , which are classified ' secret			1
' @entity22 district court judge @entity21 granted the news media 's request , although @entity21 said the tapes will remain sealed until some information on them is redacted			1
the material to be removed includes identifying information of everyone on the tapes except for the prisoner			1
she said faces other than @entity1 's will be obscured , as will voices and names			1
' protection of the identities of @entity3 staff is a legitimate goal , ' @entity21 wrote			0
' @entity40 protection can be provided by appropriate audio and visual edits , for example , blurring faces and identifying portions of uniforms , and blacking - out written materials on walls			2
' the government could appeal her ruling			0
@entity1 's lawyer , @entity51 , said that ' we are very gratified by this decision , which will enable the @entity22 people to see with their own eyes the sorts of abuses that are being heaped on these peacefully hunger - striking detainees			1
' ' once the truth is fully brought to light , we believe these terrible practices will come to an end , ' @entity51 said			0
@entity17 attorney @entity64 welcomed the decision , calling it ' a strong reaffirmation of the public 's right to know what their government is up to			2
' @entity1 was told in the spring he would be resettled in @entity72 , along with five other @entity3 prisoners			1
but as the months have dragged on and the transfer put on hold , his standoff with military officials has only deteriorated , at times turning violent			0
on thursday , the judge rejected a request by the @entity82 administration to close a hearing into @entity1 's case scheduled for monday			1
@entity1 , a @entity2 prisoner , has been held at the @entity86 - run prison for terrorist suspects at @entity3 , @entity88 , since august 2002			1
the hunger - striking detainee 's lawyers claim he was removed from his cell and force fed. a file picture shows a chair in the facility that could have been used for those purposes the @entity82 administration has been in court for months seeking to limit the amount of information released in @entity1 's case			1
' the court is well aware , as the government has emphasized , that in no case involving @entity3 detainees has any court ordered disclosure of classified information over the government 's opposition , ' @entity21 wrote in a 29 - page opinion ordering release of the tapes			1
' however - to be clear - that does not mean that in a given factual situation no court has the discretion to do so if warranted , ' the judge added			2
standard protocol at penal institutions nationwide is to videotape forcible cell extractions			0
what 's unusual about these videotapes is that many of them include footage of force - feedings in addition to forcible cell extractions			1
@entity17 attorney @entity64 called the decision ' a strong reaffirmation of the public 's right to know what their government is up to			2
' hunger strikes at @entity3 have been taking place since the early days of the island facility 's use as a prison for terrorist suspects following the september 11 attacks			1
in early 2013 , as many as 100 detainees began a hunger strike to protest their uncertain fate			2
the @entity22 has long disclosed how many are refusing to eat and whether they meet military guidelines to be force fed. but late last year , the disclosure ended			0
a @entity86 spokesman said in december 2013 that peaceful protest was allowed but that reporting numbers to the public would no longer be done			0
hunger strikes at @entity3 have been taking place since the early days of the island facility 's use as a prison for terrorist suspects following the september 11 attacks ( picture taken in 2006 ) the former @entity86 commander at @entity3 , rear adm. @entity160 , said in a court declaration filed in july that even though the forced cell extraction videos are lawful , humane and appropriate , they ' are particularly susceptible to use as propaganda and to incite a public reaction because of their depiction of forcible ... guard interaction with detainees			1
' the videos that also contain footage of forced - feedings could be used ' to foment anti-american sentiment and inflame @entity179 sensitivities as it depicts ... personnel providing medical care to a detainee while he is restrained , ' @entity160 said in the declaration			2
making public a video showing a detainee receiving medical care while restrained ' would exacerbate the world 's perception of detainees in @entity22 custody , ' @entity160 added			2
' public release , in whole or in part , of videos showing forced cell extractions ' or feedings would cause ' serious damage to national security			0
' in her ruling , @entity21 disputed many of @entity200 's points			0
after viewing the government videos and analyzing @entity200 's arguments , she found that they were ' unacceptably vague , speculative , lack specificity or are just plain implausible , ' she wrote			0
the government has already released substantial information relating to the feeding process , including the layout of and equipment in the feeding space			0
' it strains credulity to conclude that release of these videos has a substantial probability of causing the harm the government predicts , ' @entity21 wrote			0
the government argues that releasing the videos would allow adversaries to reconstruct portions of the camp infrastructure , threatening the security of the camps			0
but the judge noted that much of that information already is in the public domain .			0
