by @entity0 @entity2 mountain guides have decided to abandon this year ’s climbing season on @entity4 to honour their colleagues killed in a deadly avalanche			1
after a memorial service for the victims today , one guide said it was ‘ impossible ’ for them to continue climbing following the disaster which left 13 sherpas dead and three missing			1
the news throws the plans of hundreds of foreign climbers into disarray as it is deemed almost impossible to reach the summit without the help of the @entity2 guides and porters			1
he said : ‘ it is just impossible for many of us to continue climbing			1
while there are three of our friends buried in the snow , i ca n't imagine stepping over them			0
we want to honor the members we lost and out of respect for them we just ca n't continue			2
’ last friday , several sherpa guides were hauling climbing gear between camps when a chunk of ice tore loose and triggered an avalanche			1
thirteen bodies were recovered and three @entity13 are still missing , presumed dead			1
after the avalanche , the government quickly said it would pay the family of each sherpa who died 40,000 rupees , or about £ 391			0
the @entity13 said they deserve far more — including more insurance money , more financial aid for the families of the victims and new regulations that would ensure climbers ' rights			2
earlier today , @entity2 's government appeared to have agreed to some of demands made by the @entity13 ahead of the boycott , such as setting up a relief fund for those who are killed or injured in a climbing accident - but the funding falls short of what the @entity13 wanted			2
@entity80 monks attend prayers for @entity2 mountaineers who were victims of the avalanche on april 18 the daughter of @entity61 , one of the victims of the @entity4 avalanche , collapses during a cremation ceremony at @entity87 in @entity32 , @entity2 sherpa @entity88 , of the @entity89 in @entity32 , said the group would try to negotiate with the @entity13 and the government because a total boycott would harm @entity2 's mountaineering in the long term			1
the @entity4 climbing season provides livelihoods for thousands of @entity2 guides and porters			1
climbers have long relied on @entity13 for everything from carrying gear to cooking food to high - altitude guiding			2
without them , reaching the summit would be almost impossible			0
most attempts to reach the summit are made in mid-may , when weather is most favourable			0
if the @entity13 boycott the season , many of the climbers would have to forfeit most or all of the money they have spent to go up @entity4 , which in some cases adds up to around £ 50,000			1
at least one expedition company has cancelled the 2014 attempt for its six - member team			0
‘ our team members have empathy for the @entity124 community and we wish for everyone to be able to mourn their lost family and friends in peace , ’ the @entity118 said on its website			0
relatives carry the body of one of the @entity2 climbers killed in the avalanche - the disaster which prompted the climbing boycott by @entity2 's ethnic sherpa community at least thirteen men were killed in single deadliest accident in the history of the world 's highest mountain			1
they were laid to rest on monday in a traditional @entity80 ceremony relatives of the @entity2 climbers killed in wait for the funeral procession to begin in @entity32 on monday at least 13 people were killed and a further three remain missing after the avalanche swept the @entity152 - one of the most dangerous parts of the climb to @entity4 – on friday			1
the @entity156 mountain guides were trying to fix ropes and crack snow and ice to carve out a route for foreign climbers when they were caught in the avalanche at an altitude of about 5,800m , just below @entity165 , at about 6.30am			1
@entity2 officials have now called off the search for the three missing men - saying there is no chance of finding them alive and that their rescuers are being put at risk			0
at least three other guides caught in the deadly avalanche survived , but are in intensive care and being treated for broken limbs , ribs , blood clots and other injuries in @entity32 hospitals			0
in the wake of the avalanche , the @entity13 have expressed anger that there has not been a bigger response from @entity2 's government , which profits from the permit fees charged for the climbing expeditions			2
the avalanche caused the most deadly recorded climbing accident in @entity4 history			2
it has resulted in several sherpas quitting and boycotting expeditions for the remainder of the climbing season			2
the @entity199 said in its statement the government had agreed to the following : — a relief fund to help sherpas injured in mountaineering accidents and the families of those killed , and to pay for rescue during accidents on the mountain			0
— the government said it will stock the fund every year with 5 per cent of its earnings from @entity4 climbing fees — well below the 30 per cent the @entity13 are demanding			1
@entity2 earns some £ 2million annually in @entity4 climbing fees			2
— @entity2 will increase the insurance pay - out for those killed on the mountain to 1.5 million rupees ( £ 14,600 ) , up from the current 1 million rupees			0
the offer falls short of the @entity13 ' demand for 2 million rupees ( £ 19,500 )			0
— the government will build a memorial to the men killed in friday 's avalanche			0
— the government also will pay additional money to help rehabilitate the injured			0
