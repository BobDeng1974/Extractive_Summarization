a concerned parent who saw the pictures and found them to be violent and incendiary photographed them on her cell phone and released the images to the media , setting off a firestorm that may have played a role in @entity0 ’s eventual dismissal			0
@entity41 agents visited two of the junior high students to investigate if they or their parents posed a real threat to @entity3 , and in the aftermath of the picture controversy , @entity0 was placed on paid administrative leave for six months , @entity39 reported			2
on august 6 , school superintendent @entity49 officially dismissed the eighth - grade teacher from @entity51 , where he had spent 13 years teaching			1
during a wrongful termination hearing on wednesday , @entity49 testified that @entity0 was let go for ‘ making a bad , incompetent ’ decision by posting the ‘ violent ’ pictures , as well as for dishonesty			0
lesson learned : @entity0 gave his eighth - grade class an assignment to draw political cartoons , and among the submitted works was this poster implying that it was @entity3 hunting season media firestorm : a parent who visited the school in february noticed the cartoons hanging on the wall and became concerned , snapping photos of them with her cell phone which she then released to the media but about two dozen of @entity0 ’s former colleagues at the school came to his defense , saying that political cartoons was an entirely appropriate - and even recommended - assignment for an eighth - grade class			1

‘ i saw political points of view being expressed , whether @entity83 or @entity84 , and that 's what the lesson was designed to do			0

the lawyers also pointed out that textbooks and state - mandated assessments all ‘ adopted and approved by the @entity99 ’ endorsed student learning through political cartoons			2

nobody could have missed that			0
there would have been hundreds of students saying things about that , ’ long - time @entity51 teacher @entity129 tearfully testified			0
however , the amateur artist responsible for the poster claimed that the alleged entry wound in the president ’s right temple was the result of a marker that had been inadvertently dropped			0
