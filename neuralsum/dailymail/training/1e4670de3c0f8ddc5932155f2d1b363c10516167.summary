by @entity0 archaeologists have found a meteorite fragment in a shaman 's hut dating back 9,000 years that seems to have been worshipped as a magical object			1
the talisman was found alongside other objects that were considered sacred at the time including an amulet and a stick made of antler			1
it 's thought it gained this status because the prehistoric stone age humans saw it fall from space , suggesting they may have known it came from another world			1
a meteorite fragment from 9,000 years ago has been found by archaeologists from the @entity22 ( @entity23 ) in @entity24 , @entity25			1
it 's believed humans at the time were aware that it was from out of this world and worshipped it as a magical object @entity33 attracts around one million visitors each year , but now archaeologists at the @entity36 have revealed that it was ‘ the @entity38 ’ - and even had an ancient ‘ visitor ’s centre ’			1
ancient @entity40 from far and wide were drawn to @entity33 to see the area ’s pink flint and the @entity43 acted as an ‘ a-road ’ carrying people to a nearby settlement at @entity47 where feasts and tour guides were available even before the monument was built , one archaeologist has claimed			0
it is now thought that there was an established community in the area before the monument was built and that people travelled to the settlement in log boats			0
carbon dating of bones from giant bulls and boars discarded at @entity61 , @entity47 - a settlement around a mile from the monument - prove that @entity63 is the oldest settlement in @entity40 and has been continually occupied since @entity65			0
archaeologists think that the communities that built the monument lived and worked in the area for around 3,000 years and that @entity33 was built as part of an established settlement , rather than a monument in an empty landscape			0
archaeologists from the @entity22 in @entity24 , in north west @entity25 , found the meteorite fragment inside the caveman house by lake @entity75 in @entity77 during excavations			1
the object was a natural pyrite meteorite fragment , pyrite being an iron sulfide mineral often referred to as fool 's gold owing to its yellowish appearance			2
this meteorite , which measured eight by 5.3 by 3.5 centimetres ( 3.1 x 2.1 x 1.4 inches ) has a cylindrical shape and was porous , with a corrugated surface on its side			1
of most interest , though , was that the rock appears to have been worshipped by humans at the time , and they were perhaps even aware that it did not originate on @entity94			0
' the meteorite was brought to the shelter as a special object , they seem to have recognised it was not of this world , ' said head of research for the institute , @entity104			2
' the thing became an object of belief , and maybe even shamanic magic			2
' they may have realised it was different if it was spotted as it fell to earth , and would have been identified by the crater it made , and the heat it would have had from entering the earth 's atmosphere			0
' in addition , the side profile shape suggests various associations ; the original finder millennia ago probably saw in it shapes of a mysterious world of spirits			0
' the find was made inside a caveman house by @entity128 in @entity129 , @entity77 during excavations			0

along with the meteorite , the researchers also found other objects associated with magic , including an amulet , bone spear tip with engraved ornament and a magic stick made of antler , decorated with geometric motifs			1
the meteorite was discovered last year but it is only now that the researchers have been able to determine what it was used for			2
