by @entity1 medical correspondent travellers to exotic places should use repellents containing @entity5 to protect against insect bites - as the benefits outweigh the risks , say experts			1
@entity11 experts are backing the insecticide despite safety concerns			0
they say more harm occurs when people use too little @entity5 and put themselves at greater risk of potentially harmful diseases such as malaria and dengue fever			1
experts believe that travellers to exotic locations should use insect repellent containing @entity5 as the benefits outweigh any potential side effects ( picture posed by model ) latest figures suggest the number of visits by @entity11 to tropical countries went up by two million between 2002 and 2012 – from 4.02m to 6.03m			1
previous research has questioned the safety of @entity5 , which contains @entity33 , n - diethyl - m - toluamide and was developed by the @entity36 army for jungle warfare just after @entity38 it is the active ingredient in many commercial topical repellents sold today			1
however , some governments limit its concentration after reports of a type of brain disease called encephalopathy following deet use			0
dr @entity46 , senior lecturer in medical entomology at the @entity48 , recommends using repellents containing 20 - 50 per cent @entity5 in tropical countries			1
he said ‘ if @entity5 products are restricted to just 15 per cent , it is likely that millions of people will be put at greater risk of mosquito bites which will dramatically increase their likelihood of developing a disease like malaria or dengue as a result			1
‘ there is plenty of evidence to show that low levels of @entity5 are not very effective , so it is important that travellers have access to repellents with greater levels of @entity5 that will provide the best protection			1
’ dr @entity46 said people should use repellents containing between 20 - 50 per cent @entity5 to counter the threat of mosquito bites a new review of existing studies headed by dr @entity46 concludes there is insufficient evidence to show that @entity5 is unsafe for human use			1
the review , published in the open access journal @entity83 and @entity84 ( must credit ) , found the benefits of avoiding disease - spreading insect bites outweigh any risks associated with applying @entity5 to the skin			2
it discovered only one existing human trial on the safety of @entity5 , in pregnant women in @entity93			2
this study compared women who used a @entity5 - based repellent to prevent malaria transmission to a control group			2
there was evidence of traces of @entity5 in the children , suggesting that the substance could cross the placental barrier , but , crucially , no differences in the health of the babies between the @entity5 treatment group and the control group babies			2
the review also looked at existing animal studies to assess the safest amount of @entity5 to use in repellents and found that insufficient evidence had been gained from these to justify any imposed limits on concentration of @entity5			1
based on this , the authors weigh the safety risks found in trials against the protection that @entity5 - based repellents give against transmission of diseases			1
dr @entity46 said the best protection against insect - borne illness was to avoid getting bitten , but repellent played an important part in reducing the burden of illness			2
he said ‘ our review article found very few studies that suggested any adverse effect of @entity5			0
‘ in fact , there were only 14 cases of encephalopathy associated with @entity5 since 1957 which is extremely small considering the estimated 200 million applications of @entity5 to the skin each year			0
‘ if @entity5 caused serious health problems , we would know about it by now			0
’ a spokeswoman for the @entity48 said dengue fever - a viral infection that is transmitted to humans by @entity145 mosquitoes - is present in @entity146 where football fans from around the world are due to converge for the world cup			0
it can cause life - threatening illness and there is there is no cure and no vaccine against it			0
the main protection against dengue fever is insect repellents , she said			0
‘ biting arthropods can transmit a whole range of diseases to humans and it is vital to protect ourselves ’ added dr @entity46			0
‘ vaccines and treatments are available for some diseases , but not all , and so the best way to keep as safe as possible is to use an insect repellent containing @entity5 and reapply it regularly			0
‘ we want people to enjoy their holidays and tropical trips - we do n’t want them ruined by illness so we want to do all we can to help inform and educate people about the facts rather than the many myths surrounding this issue ’ he said .			0

travellers to exotic locations should use spray containing at least 20 per cent @entity5
experts warn that 15 per cent @entity5 puts millions of people at mosquito risk
the best *defence* is to avoid getting bitten but repellents can be effective
