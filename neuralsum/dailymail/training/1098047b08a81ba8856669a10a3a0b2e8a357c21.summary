by @entity0 published : 17:07 est , 22 january 2014 updated : 17:07 est , 22 january 2014 bosoms			2
the funniest word in the @entity4 language , according to my son			2
this is a ) because he is at that age , and b ) because he is a huge fan of @entity10 , who is always making jokes about her bosoms - or the ‘ mir - udders ’ , as her on - screen mother @entity14 calls them			2
his favourite is the one about the ' bosom clap '			2
that 's when your bosoms are so large and pendulous they make a clapping sound when you turn over in bed			1
' has that ever happened to you ? ' he asked , sniggering			2
that 's the thanks i get for all those endless hours of breastfeeding			1
@entity0 admits there are times when you will want to work your cleavage - so do n't neglect it in your beauty regime i do n't imagine that the @entity38 actress @entity37 suffers from the breast clap ; nevertheless , her frontage was not much enhanced by the plunging neckline she wore at the @entity42 earlier this week			1
it was one of those dresses that , had it worked , would have broken the prim lady mary typecasting once and for all ( perhaps that ’s why she chose it )			2
except she did n't quite carry it off			2
the problem with very low cut dresses like that is they are designed either for very small , very neat breasts or for the kind of fake ones more commonly on show in @entity60			1
and since miss @entity37 has neither , the result was simply an ill - fitting outfit and an actress who looked rather uncomfortable			1
still , it got her noticed			0
taking the plunge : @entity37 wore a revealing dress to the @entity42 whatever shape and size frontage you happen to possess , there are times when you 're going to want to work it			1
and although the general ( mostly male ) consensus seems to be that bigger is better , the reality is that a shapely frontage is not only harder to dress than a more demure one ; it also requires a good deal more maintenance			1
the key thing is to treat your cleavage as you would your face			1
the skin on your chest is very delicate , and as we age and things start to slide south , it 's one of the first places to start going a bit crinkly			1
it 's also an area that gets a fair amount of uv exposure , even if you are not directly sunbathing			1
use an illuminator to give the cleavage some glow there are , of course , plenty of bust creams around , many of which make some frankly outrageous claims			1
but unless you are tackling a specific breast problem , such as stretch marks , for day - to - day use apply your normal face cream , plus a good suncream			1
for evenings and special occasions , you might want to add a little lustre			0
i find that mixing a bit of my trusty @entity112 ( i know , sorry , but i did n't name it ) with any old body cream gives a lovely subtle glow , just enough to make the skin look dewy , but not so much that you look like a glitterball			1
alternatively , you can invest in a bottle of @entity119 ( £ 21 , marksandspencer.com ) , which is also wonderful on bare legs			0
one of the least flattering things is a long cleavage , the sort of thing that looks like you might be able to park a small bicycle in it			1
this is fairly easy to remedy : you just need to choose your bra carefully			0
the secret is to make sure the bit in the middle sits snugly on your sternum ; if it does n't , it 's either the wrong size or the wrong shape for your breasts			1
also , choose a full cup style rather than a cutaway			0
until relatively recently , bras like this only came in nun - like nylon			1
lately , though , even the more matronly among us have been able to prettify our underwear drawers			0
@entity142 ( from bravissimo.com ) is an especially good range , and incredibly hard - wearing ; while @entity146 's @entity145 range expertly combines functionality with flirtatiousness			1
pink lady : @entity150 i do n't know about you , but this is the time of year when i need to make a really superhuman effort not to lose the will to live			0
it ’s dark , it ’s cold and it feels like it ’s been january for ever			0
sadly , the @entity160 is n't on the cards any time soon			0
so i shall just have to settle for sunshine in make - up form : the spring / summer collections			0
nothing like a bit of june jollity to liven up a dreary january			0
this year , it 's even more fun because , basically , it 's all about pink			1
but not anaemic pastels or sparkly fairy pink			0
strong , vibrant shades that pack a punch ; racy roses and febrile fuchsias			0
it 's one of those trends that looks great on the models ; but how do you translate it into everyday use ? first stop , @entity185			1
season after season , @entity185 somehow manages to distil the catwalks into something we can all use			0
this time it 's @entity192 in @entity193 ( £ 27 ) , a fine dusting of versatile colour ( eyes , cheeks , face ) as soft as baby 's breath , that makes tired winter skin bloom like a spring rose			1
crush ... @entity202 ( £ 32 , @entity203 )			0
treats , corrects and protects skin			1
no gluten , mineral oil , fragrance , parabens or talc — so it wo n’t irritate			0
fail ... selfies , belfies - and now beaufies			0
that 's when celebrities such as @entity217 share pictures of themselves in pampering mode , above			2
@entity219 ( @entity220 ) , guys			0
@entity223 's super luxurious @entity222 ( £ 42.50 ) is more of a shimmery , sandy desert pink , ideal for very fair skins that do n’t need a lot of colour or if you like that glossy @entity231 look			2
for lips , @entity233 ’s @entity232 ( £ 24 ) come in three great pinks of increasing intensity : powerful , infamous and @entity238 , all fortified with plumping ingredients			0
pop star @entity150 is queen of the bright lip , and her new polish collection for @entity242 is hot to trot			0
@entity243 ( £ 11 ) is the pink to have , a fluorescent fuchsia definitely not for shrinking violets			0
lastly , do n't be afraid to wear pink on your eyes : it 's surprisingly flattering , and can make you look wide awake and wonderfully fresh			2
@entity252 's @entity251 are some of the best quality eyeshadows around for the money - just £ 6.99 from @entity255			2
@entity256 is the one to get : good enough to eat .			0

@entity38 's @entity37 recently wore dress with plunging neckline
there are times when we need to show off cleavage
need to treat it as you would face to keep it looking young
skin is delicate and needs regular *moisturising*
