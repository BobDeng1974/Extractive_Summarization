as @entity2 ’s first goal went in on tuesday night , @entity0 sank back in his seat			1
it was hard to tell whether the look was one of exasperation or resignation			2
@entity0 had a year to prepare for this , a year to solve the problems that characterised his team ’s defeat against @entity13 last season			1
it took just a quarter of an hour for him to realise he had n’t managed it			2
for all that @entity18 found a way back into this game in the second half , the decisive period was the opening half - hour			1
it told us that @entity18 continue to chase their tails when it comes to finding the right template in the @entity27			1
@entity29 midfielder brings down @entity2 having struggled to control the middle of the park on tuesday @entity18 's players are stunned after @entity13 put in a magnificent first - half performance @entity34 ( right ) had a tough task in the centre of midfield as @entity13 prevailed 2 - 1 at the @entity38 they grabbed something from this game by chasing it hard			1
their energy and will found them a way and @entity48 ’s penalty save at the death means that the @entity51 champions head to @entity52 next month in better spirits than they might have mustered			2
the truth is , however , that teams do not make significant headway in this tournament by chasing games , especially at home			2
dominance comes from solid possession			2
it comes from control and method			0
city continue to invest in their squad but nights like this raise valid questions about whether the team is actually moving forward			0
if this seems unkind given the stellar nature of the opposition , so be it			0
this is the company @entity18 have made it their stated intention to keep			1
nobody expects them to dominate the ball against @entity83 ’s extraordinarily gifted team			0
the one way to make sure you fail against @entity13 is by trying to copy them			1
former @entity87 striker @entity2 whips in his first - goal for the visitors after just 16 minutes @entity2 runs away with his trademark celebration having given the @entity92 giants the lead in the first - half nevertheless , @entity18 must realise they simply must do better			1
they must find a way to dictate passages of play against the best opposition , if not the whole game			0
there remains a lack of authority to their play in @entity105			0
it is not just @entity13 who have come to the @entity38 and messed the home team around for periods			1
even @entity114 and @entity115 have done it			0
one senses that @entity0 and football director @entity118 know exactly what the problem is			1
it goes right to the heart of the team — to the centre of the @entity18 midfield			1
this is where foundations for victories at this level are built			0
this is where momentum builds			0
it comes from possession , from the rhythm of simply moving the ball			0
@entity18 keeper @entity48 ( centre ) reacts after @entity13 went 2 - 0 after just 30 minutes @entity139 ( centre ) grapples with @entity13 's @entity141 as he attempts to regain possession @entity18 have invested in the @entity29 duo @entity142 and @entity139 over the last two summers in a bid to construct a platform			1
@entity146 has added something domestically in that area this season			0
on tuesday , @entity34 began the game there with @entity139			0
still , though , @entity18 look a million miles short			1
certainly they do when compared to players like @entity13 ’s @entity153 and , for example , @entity110 ’s @entity157 , or even @entity156 ’s @entity155			1
on tuesday night , @entity18 missed @entity158 , of course			1
even @entity158 , though , has looked muddled at times in @entity105 — not knowing whether to go or hold — and that is perhaps why @entity18 ’s search has led them to the door of the @entity166 international midfielder @entity165 of @entity167			2
@entity34 ( right ) struggled to help @entity18 dictate the midfield against @entity13 the former @entity170 player will not come cheap this summer but @entity18 ’s interest is real			1
he is the right age and it is not hard to see where @entity165 ’s physicality would improve this team			0
on tuesday , @entity139 and @entity34 were humbled from the start			0
the @entity29 had a wretched night			0
his first contribution was to give the ball straight to @entity179			0
the subsequent pass almost landed on @entity141 ’s toe			2
some start that would have been			0
@entity2 ca n't hide his delight having scored his second of the night to put @entity13 2 - 0 up on the night ten minutes later the @entity18 midfielder erred again , passing the ball to @entity2 who raced through on goal			1
during a 30 - minute spell during the middle of the opening half , @entity18 were second best by a rather distressing distance			1
@entity141 was almost impossible to track , sometimes dropping so deep he could almost shake hands with his own central defenders			2
when he moved , he did so in a manner alien to those in blue			0
@entity2 was similarly difficult to follow and @entity198 , operating from a starting position on the left side , timed his forays infield with devastating instinct			1
a second goal goes in for @entity13 and @entity48 lets out a roar of frustration in the @entity18 goal mouth @entity208 fired in a delightful strike for @entity18 but with two away goals , @entity13 are in command it was in turn thrilling and demoralising to watch and @entity18 really should have been able to come up with a more convincing answer			1
everything @entity13 did was straight from the @entity216 ’s most classic playbook			2
city have invested money and thought in preparing @entity0 ’s squad for nights like this and at times here it was difficult to work out where it had all gone			2
certainly @entity18 improved in the second half but it was all rather too late			1
at the end there was a sense of relief that the damage had not been greater			0
that , however , is n’t what @entity235 football is about			0
it is not about relief or small mercies			0
it ’s about winning , it ’s about moving forward			0
@entity18 , undeniably , remain inert			2
@entity208 celebrates his second - half goal at the @entity38 as @entity0 's side looked to draw level with @entity13			1

@entity2 scored twice to put @entity13 2 - 0 up vs @entity18 at half - time
@entity208 reduced @entity0 's side 's *deficit* in the second - half
@entity250 was sent off for a second booking late on at the @entity38
@entity141 missed a *stoppage* time penalty for the visitors
