by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:58 est , 13 september 2012 updated : 07:20 est , 14 september 2012 @entity2 today shrugged off reports 14 conservative mps have launched a secret plot to oust him as @entity7 leader			1
the prime minister went ahead with a visit to a @entity11 warehouse , destroyed in last year 's riots , amid reports of a ' drip , ' drip ' process to challenge his leadership			1
it is understood the 14 have written to @entity19 , chairman of the powerful backbench @entity20 , demanding a leadership contest			0
prime minister @entity2 was today shown round the warehouse by general manager of @entity11 @entity24 @entity23 shipping out ? @entity2 today visited the @entity25 ( dadc ) warehouse in @entity27 , north @entity28 which was damaged by fire during last year 's riots under @entity7 rules a contest is automatically triggered if 15 per cent of the party ’s mps write letters to mr @entity19 calling for the leader to go			1
the 14 letters , reported in the @entity38 magazine , which has close links to the @entity40 , remain well short of the 46 needed to trigger a leadership contest			2
but , because of a quirk in the rules , the letters remain on file indefinitely , meaning that mr @entity2 could face a ‘ drip , drip ’ process of discontent			2
today the pm was shown round the newly - reopened @entity25 ( dadc ) warehouse in @entity27 , north @entity28 which was set on fire during the riots last summer			0
allies played down the significance of the revolt against the pm , noting that making spending cuts while being in coalition was always going to be unpopular with some sections of the @entity7 party			2
a source said : ' he is getting on with the job , as usual			0
' heading for the exit : the pm has shrugged off talk of a challenge to his leadership , with allies noting that making spending cuts was always going to be unpopular rebel @entity40 and loyalists alike dismissed claims that an organised coup was under way			2
one rebel mp said there was no serious threat to the prime minister ’s position for now because there was no alternative leader waiting in the wings			1
but he said the situation could change if mr @entity2 failed to turn round the party ’s fortunes before the next election , or if @entity28 mayor @entity86 , viewed by some as a possible future leader , returns to the @entity89			0
‘ there is no organised campaign against the prime minister at the moment , ’ he said			1
‘ you could easily get 46 names if there was an alternative leader , but there is n’t			0
if @entity86 was here things might be very different			0
on the up : mayor of london @entity86 's popularity has continued to rise , and should he return to the @entity89 he could be a potential @entity7 leader ‘ but if we find ourselves running towards a cliff like lemmings as the next election approaches then the party would change leadership overnight			1
’ loyalists also dismissed claims of a concerted move against the prime minister			2
mr @entity19 last night declined to comment on the report			0
but he stressed that it was impossible for anyone else to know how many , if any , letters he had received from colleagues about the prime minister			1
‘ no - one other than me could possibly know because i do not discuss it with anyone , ’ he said			0
supporters of mr @entity2 attempted to toughen up the leadership rules before the last election by raising the threshold for triggering a contest and placing a time limit on letters sent to mr @entity19			1
but the move was abandoned after the @entity40 failed to win a majority at the election .			0

up to 14 @entity131 have signed letters calling for the prime minister to go , according to reports
with no time limit on a challenge , there risks being a ' drip , drip ' processof *collecting* more signatures
allies of the @entity7 leader insist he is just getting on with the job as he returns to site of summer rioting
