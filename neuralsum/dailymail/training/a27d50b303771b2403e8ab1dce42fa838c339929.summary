by @entity0 published : 14:39 est , 4 december 2013 updated : 17:37 est , 4 december 2013 @entity1 has revealed that when he leaves the @entity2 in 2016 , he wants to take over @entity3			2
he made a joke about the prospect during a meeting with @entity7 , the chairman of @entity8 which owns @entity9 , but the ceo apparently did not take the offer seriously			1
@entity1 was in @entity12 touring the headquarters of @entity14 during the week before @entity15 when he went on a private tour of the facility and spoke with the company 's top executives			1
' at least i know what i want to do when i retire ... host @entity36 's @entity35 , ' he said while facing mr @entity7			1
joke 's on you : @entity8 chairman @entity7 reportedly laughed at the suggestion sources in the room during the closed meeting said ' everyone had a good giggle ' including mr @entity7 , but aside from the laugh , he is not believed to have made any other remarks about the issue			1
it was n't the only time he had the crowd laughing during that @entity12 trip as he went on to kid that his ears were the inspiration for that of one of @entity14 ' best - known characters : shrek			2
the president 's love of sports is well - known but he has largely kept his opinions neutral - with exceptions being made for his hometown @entity64 teams			1
the prospect of trading the @entity68 for a desk on the @entity3 set would certainly help the president de-stress after two terms in office , but he has been able to keep up with the @entity74 while in office			0
he regularly takes in basketball games at @entity78 's @entity77 and was seated in the front row alongside his wife and daughters when @entity82 played the @entity83 on november 17			2
( @entity85 's brother @entity84 is the head coach of @entity87 's team			2
) keeping up with sports : the @entity89 attended a college game in @entity91 on november 17 because @entity85 's brother @entity84 is the head coach for the @entity93 should the joke of a retirement plan come to fruition , it wo n't be the first time that he tries out such a gig			1
in january 2010 , president @entity1 joined the @entity100 commentators during the third quarter of the @entity104 - @entity103 face off			0
during that appearance , he told @entity100 ' @entity106 that he 'd better watch out because he 'll be vying to take over			0
' after retirement i â€™m coming after your job , @entity106 , just letting you know			0
you either have three more years or seven - i 'm not sure which but you need to plan accordingly , ' the president said during his first year in office			0
' i 'm going to do some play by play			0
' dropping hints : the president first suggested these retirement plans when he joined @entity100 commentators during a @entity104 - @entity103 game in the @entity77 in january 2010			0

the joke came during a meeting with @entity7 , the chairman of @entity9 's parent company
