with dazzling flashes of green , blue and white , a mysterious object lit up the @entity3 sky early this morning			1
it silently soared over the state at around 4.40am , seemingly lingering for a few seconds			1
but while some excitedly rushed to report a @entity7 , one astronomer claims it was a burning meteor that was so far away it could n't be heard			1
seconds later , neighbours took to @entity26 reporting flashes of blue and green			1
one wrote on @entity27 : ' at approximately 4:43 am i was in my back yard having a cigarette			1
' the sky was crystal clear , and as usual i was looking up at the sky , looking at the @entity35 constellation			2
' then in front of me i saw a bright green , white , blue , light with a tail			1
' reminding me of a falling star , except much larger , and slower			2
strange : the light slowly faded as the object drifted out of view slowly and steady as others saw it to be blue ' then i thought of the meteor over @entity49			1
as i watched this object , i had time to think how big it appeared , and that it was traveling silently			2
' it lasted several seconds , four to eight			0
as it moved across my field of vision the tail seemed to be sparking , or breaking off in pieces			0
' it was close enough that i expected to hear a crash , as it seemed to be traveling in a downward direction			2
' as it travelled ( sic ) behind structures and out of my sight , i thought i should go see if i could find it , thinking that it would have come down very close			0
' i did not go though			0
i do not know what it was			0
i know it was not a simple falling star			0
it was way to big , and moving way to slow			2
' @entity75 : it then inexplicably lost all its light before gradually lighting up again , which many said is like a @entity7 contradicted : an astronomer claims this behavior is typical of a bolide meteor which is about to combust according to @entity82 , the @entity85 / @entity84 solar system ambassador to @entity3 , the variety of flashing colours is typical of a bolide meteor , which combusts at the end of its flight			1
it is caused by the rock cooling down as it passes through the atmosphere			0
once the bolide explodes , it will likely send pieces hurling down to earth - which could be very valuable			0
if nearby , the sheer pace of the bolide could be so loud it could crack windows but @entity105 explained , despite shining brighter than the moon , it was lightyears away because it was silent			0

@entity3 *residents* reported flashing white , blue , green lights at 4.40am
some listed the sighting on @entity27 , object ' lingered moving slowly '
but astronomer claims it was a burning meteor too far away to hear
