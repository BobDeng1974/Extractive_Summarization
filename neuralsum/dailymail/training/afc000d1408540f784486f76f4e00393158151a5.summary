despite the individual honours and the @entity3 highs , this ranks as one of the best days in the career of @entity6			1
as @entity9 rattled in a stunning injury - time winner , the ecstatic @entity8 manager ran onto the pitch			1
think that penalty against @entity13 in @entity14 ; think typical @entity6			1
‘ @entity18 is back ’ , the @entity8 fans roared in one corner of the @entity17			2
@entity6 threw out his chest , raising an arm high in the air to let them know they are in this together			2
he has suffered a fortnight from hell but there are signs of life			0
he looked like his old self			0
@entity6 celebrates wildly after @entity9 's late winning goal as @entity8 beat rivals @entity32 2 - 1 @entity6 was under intense pressure after a poor run of results that had seen them slip to 13th in the table @entity6 spills onto the pitch after @entity9 scores his late winner at @entity40 @entity6 went wild on the touchline as his @entity8 team rallied from a goal down to win the derby @entity6 's celebrations were reminiscent of his iconic roar from @entity3 's win over @entity13 at @entity14 @entity48 leads the @entity8 celebrations at the full - time whistle @entity8 's @entity9 ( right ) celebrates after scoring his side 's winner in injury time @entity55 celebrates after equalising for @entity8 after 74 minutes @entity6 celebrates as @entity55 equalises for @entity8 in the second - half to come back from a goal down with 15 minutes remaining against a team who had conceded just two home goals since early november is one thing but to do it in your arch - rivals ’ back yard is another			1
these are only three points but the way in which they were earned is rather more important			0
it appeared more than good enough when @entity55 swivelled inside the six - yard box to scramble in an equaliser			1
@entity6 spun round to the bench to perform his legendary punching celebration and it got better when 20 - year - old @entity9 scored his first professional goal			1
what a place to get it			0
‘ all my mates are @entity32 fans , i was getting messages from them last night saying do n’t score the winner , ’ @entity9 , an academy product , beamed			1
he has bought his boss plenty more time now			2
‘ i ’m entrenched in @entity83 , ’ he said			0
‘ this is more than just a job for me , let ’s be honest			0
i enjoy football at the all - or - nothing end of it			2
‘ the players realised there ’s nothing to fear here , gentlemen			0
all that pressure we ’ve heaped upon ourselves was relieved by a touch			2
’ @entity32 manager @entity97 reacts after @entity8 left his team stunned with a comeback win @entity100 leads the celebrations after @entity48 's own goal gave @entity32 the lead on 16 minutes @entity32 's mascot even got involved with the celebrations after @entity32 took the lead in the @entity108 derby @entity109 celebrates after @entity32 took the lead thanks to @entity48 's own goal early on @entity48 ( right ) did n't know a great deal about his own goal as a @entity32 corner struck him and went in @entity32 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity115 6 ; @entity116 6.5 , @entity117 6 , @entity118 6 , @entity119 6 ; @entity120 6.5 , @entity121 6.5 ( @entity122 46 - 6 ) , @entity123 7.5 ; ward 7 ( @entity125 76 - 6 ) , @entity100 7 , @entity126 7 substitutes not used : @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 scorer : @entity134 own goal 16 booked : @entity135 , @entity120 @entity8 ( 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 ) : @entity136 6 ; @entity137 6 , @entity138 6 , @entity139 6 , @entity140 5 ; @entity141 7 ( @entity142 81 - 6 ) , @entity143 6.5 , @entity134 5 , @entity9 7.5 ; @entity144 7 ( @entity145 90 ) ; @entity146 7 substitutes not used : @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 scorers : @entity146 75 ; @entity9 90 +2 booked : @entity138 , @entity143 @entity153 man : @entity9 referee : @entity155 6 attendance : 32,705 ( 2,645 away ) a @entity32 supporter confronted @entity8 centre - back @entity138 at full time , failing to land two punches before being rugby tackled to the ground by @entity145 , but nothing could ruin @entity8 ’s day			1
oddly , it could all have been very different			0
@entity6 might have found himself staring down the barrel			2
@entity162 , who played under him at @entity163 , said yesterday morning that players are not stupid ; that they suss his faux motivation early on			0
the reply was measured : ‘ i ’m not interested in what @entity162 ’s had to say , ’ said @entity6			2
‘ i do apologise to him for putting @entity169 in his place at @entity163			0
‘ i know my limitations , as a man , i know my limitations as a coach			0
i think i ’m improving , i ’ve got a continual mentality to want to improve game by game and i ’m pretty unshakeable in terms of criticism			0
’ @entity180 was later proved wrong after @entity8 had held a pre-match @entity182 team meeting			2
it looked bad when @entity48 got them off to a torrid start by inexplicably diverting the ball into his own net unchallenged from a corner in the 16th minute			1
from then until half - time , @entity8 were a mess			1
they were nervous , the occasion clearly getting to them			0
the manager was jittery on the touchline , unable to stand still , and was angered by referee @entity155 ’s refusal to award a penalty when @entity118 held @entity198 ’s shirt at a corner			0
one supporter ran onto the pitch at the final whistle and attempted to attack the @entity8 players the supporter was quickly bundled to the ground by stewards and detained @entity32 's @entity121 fires in a shot on goal that swerved wide of the target in the first - half @entity8 manager @entity6 reacts with disappointment after a chance goes begging at @entity40 @entity32 's @entity135 comes under pressure from @entity8 's @entity144 during the keenly - contested derby @entity8 's @entity140 ( left ) slides in on @entity32 player @entity126 and wins the ball on the ground but , as so often happens in the @entity218 , the landscape changed in a flash , leaving @entity32 manager @entity97 fuming : ‘ we showed our total immaturity in this game — we got overexcited and lost our shape			1
’ @entity32 had been incapable of clearing a routine free - kick and £ 5.5miilion signing @entity146 stabbed the ball home inside the six - yard box , sparking delirium			1
@entity6 became even more excited when @entity9 waltzed untracked to smash the winner in stoppage time			1
as the manager ran onto the pitch , he might just have been thinking that this was the moment his career changes for the better			0
@entity198 attempts to spin away from @entity32 's @entity123 and take the ball with him @entity8 's @entity198 ( left ) fights for the ball with @entity32 's @entity109 during the opening minutes under - pressure @entity8 manager @entity6 pictured in his dug - out before the match @entity8 chairman @entity241 watches on from the stands at the @entity17			1

@entity8 beat @entity32 2 - 1 in the @entity108 derby
@entity9 rattled home the winner in stoppage time
@entity55 had earlier brought @entity8 level at @entity40
a @entity48 own goal had given @entity32 a 16th - minute lead
the result eases the pressure on @entity8 manager @entity6
