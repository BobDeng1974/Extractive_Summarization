@entity18 later apologised after a number of complaints			0
he said : ' nobody comes out of the @entity3 rape case with any credit – not the victim who ’d drunk so much she could barely stand , nor the two footballers who had sex with her in the most sordid of circumstances			1
’ speaking on @entity29 today , he said : ' if i gave the impression that the two issues of her being drunk and the rape for which @entity3 was convicted were some sort of moral equivalent , that would be terrible and something i would need to apologise for			1
it was not my intention			0
' he said : ' if people took from it the impression that i was blaming the victim for the rape , that was absolutely not my intention			1
' having said that , the fact that the victim was drunk was the central issue in the court case			1
in fact , it was her case that she was so drunk she was incapable of giving consent			2
' i 'm not sure we 're in the position where subsequently we should n't mention that , or perhaps i was clumsy			0
@entity1 said he was ' totally responsible ' for the content of the short trailer , which he wrote himself before it was broadcast during @entity17 's today programme yesterday			1

@entity70 had sex with the victim , before @entity3 arrived and raped her , as two others filmed it through the window			2
@entity3 apologised last night – but only to his long - suffering girlfriend for cheating on her with the teenager he was convicted of raping			1
in a halting video statement posted directly on to a website set up to try to clear his name , the 25 - year - old said he had made ‘ an incredibly foolish decision ’ by having sex with the drunken girl and ‘ learnt a valuable lesson ’			2
but he failed to use the opportunity to condemn his supporters for suggesting she had lied over the attack to cash in on his status as a wealthy footballer or illegally circulating her name online			0
the closest he came to alluding to how his victim – now 22 – had been forced to abandon her old life was an expression of regret at ‘ the damage that has been done on so many fronts ’ because of that night			2
prosecuted : @entity3 , pictured on this week with his girlfriend @entity127 , was found guilty of rape because his victim was unable to consent instead he concentrated on confirming his determination to clear his name while pushing for a return to the ‘ privilege ’ of being a professional footballer again			1

the woman is seen walking into the @entity68 in @entity149 where she was attacked by @entity3 , who was released from prison last week			2
@entity151 told @entity152 they are ' looking into ' the post named : ' too drunk to consent , too drunk to remember ? ' , which uses the footage from the night of the rape two years ago			2
the woman he attacked , 22 , continues to be targeted by trolls who support @entity3			2
she has had to start a new life away from her friends and family in @entity163 after nine people were convicted of illegally naming her in 2012			0
she was named at least 6,000 times on @entity167 alone following the conviction of @entity169 international @entity3 and was labelled a ' slag ' , ' tramp ' , ' bitch ' and ' whore '			0
police put her ' relocation package ' together after her lifelong anonymity — protection afforded to anyone who has made and allegation of a sexual assault — was breached on the internet			0
but @entity167 trolls have continued to pursue her even though illegal naming carries a maximum fine of £ 5,000 , and now claim to have revealed her new identity			0
