the impact in @entity26 , @entity5 claimed the lives of @entity28 , 32 , who was driving the @entity23 and 37 - year old sister @entity11 who was a front seat passenger			1
mrs @entity32 's two sons @entity33 and @entity34 , who are 16 and 17 - years - old , were sat in the back and were left fighting for life with serious injuries and had to be cut free from the mangled wreckage			1
they have since made a good recovery			0
police initially investigated whether @entity41 from @entity42 , @entity5 was racing a friend in a @entity44 as both cars appeared to be accelerating and slowing down apparently to avoid speed cameras			0
but they later ruled out the racing line of inquiry and freed the other driver without charge			0
it emerged the double tragedy occurred just five months after @entity54 was caught speeding at 54mph in another 30mph zone in @entity56			0
today the Â£ 1,000 - a - week defender who has been at @entity3 since 2003 and has represented @entity58 at under - 17 level pleaded guilty to two offences of causing death by careless or inconsiderate driving			1
he asked to be dealt with at @entity5 magistrates court where jail terms can not exceed six months - but the bench instead sent to him to be dealt with by a judge at crown court as they ruled the offence was too serious and bordered on dangerous driving			1
@entity72 was given an interim driving ban pending sentencing next month			1
the tragedy occurred at about 10.15pm on saturday september 1 last year on @entity75 at its junction with @entity77			0
at the time mr @entity11 's was driving his sister and her children home from a @entity81 temple and was due to return to collect his wife and their two children , aged one and three			1

he has been able to enter and plead on the very first occasion and accepts that he is responsible for this incident			0
decorated : the talented footballer has represented @entity58 and has a burgeoning career at @entity96 champions @entity3 ' his lack of driving experience contributed to a likelihood of a collision			2
he was driving in a straight line on the main road and he car had emerged unexpectedly			1
the right of way belonged with the driver on the main road but the issue arises out of the speed he was travelling at			2
' adjourning the case chairman of the bench @entity112 said : ' we believe it is not suitable for magistrates for sentence			0
we feel it was not far short of dangerous driving in addition the aggravating factors are too young people were seriously injured			2
' @entity72 was granted unconditional bail until sentencing at @entity123 on february 28			0
a 19 - year - old man who was driving the grey @entity44 at the time of the collision will face no further action			2
at the time of the crash @entity130 , 19 , a relative of mr @entity11 and mrs @entity32 spoke of the two victims having ' joy on their faces ' shortly before the tragedy			1
he said : ' we get together every saturday at the temple but this week there was a special ceremony because it was the first day of our @entity140			0
' it 's always a happy service and it 's a big day in the religious calendar			0
they had joy on their faces			2

' @entity147 's wife has been left with a one - year - old son and a three - year - old girl			0
he was a loving father - he would help anyone			0
