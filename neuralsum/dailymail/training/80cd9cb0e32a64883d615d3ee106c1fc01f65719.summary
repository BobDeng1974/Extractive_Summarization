well , this is a far cry from the tawdry scenes we 're used to seeing in porn films			0
in fact , without closer inspection you ’d be forgiven for thinking that this incredible new video was just a nature documentary			1
in fact it 's pornography filmed with a flying drone			1
as the camera pans out over rolling mountains and secluded seascapes you could blink and miss the couples who feature in the film , engaging in sexual acts in the most picturesque and remote of landscapes			1
filmed in @entity26 and with locations spanning from a luscious green corn field to some deserted steps this is a style of pornography the likes of which we have never seen before			1
fans claim that it is much more subtle in its nature and therefore far more female friendly			0
@entity38 , a filmmaker from @entity39 and one of the people behind the video told @entity43 of his creation , ‘ we wanted to explore the whole idea of drone privacy and strikes — this idea of ' make porn , not war			1

’ in two scenes from the film a lesbian couple enjoy themselves on top of a roof ( left ) , whilst an amorous pair make a pit stop at the side of the road for some fun whilst the film is pornography it also captures a series of beautiful nature shoots , for example the forest covered mountains in @entity26 an example of the type of drone camera that ghost + @entity77 would have used to film their ' @entity79 ' video			1
you can clearly see the camera attached to the front of the device @entity38 and @entity84 aka @entity85 are the men behind ' @entity79 ' the film captures a variety of straight , gay and lesbian couples having sex			1
@entity38 ’s film - making partner @entity84 said , ‘ we wanted to see the artistic value of this perspective			2
' it 's an omniscient point of view , really			0
' we did these shots in places where you could n't see much from the ground , but then you put a drone in the air and you can see what 's happening			2
’ the result is quite stunning , although the filmmakers ran into trouble when they were spotted by a woman who was walking her dog on the beach where they were filming			2
@entity38 and @entity84 own a film company named @entity77 and this is the first time either of the men have embarked on a project like this			1
