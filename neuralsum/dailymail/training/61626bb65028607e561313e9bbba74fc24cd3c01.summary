@entity0 praised his side 's " mature display " after @entity1 leapfrogged @entity2 into second place in the @entity4 following a 1 - 0 win at @entity6			1
@entity10 's 18th of the season - and 100th career goal - proved the difference , although @entity2 will look at their own role in the decider after the striker latched onto a poor back header by @entity18			1
despite enduring a nervy ending after midfielder @entity20 was sent off late on , @entity0 was delighted with his side			2
@entity1 rise to second in the @entity4 , level on points , temporarily at least , with leaders @entity26 @entity27 carries the ball forward for @entity2 , who succumb to their first defeat in 10 @entity4 games @entity2 : @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity18 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 ( @entity38 68 ) , @entity39 ( @entity40 56 ) , @entity41 ( @entity42 72 ) , @entity43 , @entity44			1

sent off : @entity67 ( 90 ) booked : @entity20 goals : @entity10 57 att : 20,861 ref : @entity69 ( @entity70 ) he said : " that was as good an away performance as we have had for a long time			1
this is a tough place to come but we put in a really mature display			0
" you need to have that maturity to win games and sometimes we have been a little naive and not got the results			2
but today we stood up to their challenge when we had to , defended well and played it around			0
" the game was n't pretty at times but this performance , and the belief and confidence it will give us , is something we can build on			0
" the hosts , largely out - of - sorts , actually started the brighter and almost took the lead after just three minutes when @entity39 took advantage of a fabulous crossfield pass by @entity43			0
the midfielder 's shot from the edge of the area was parried by @entity1 keeper @entity50 with @entity44 's rebound blocked by @entity99			1
the home side were shading the opening proceedings and @entity43 fizzed a shot just over after a sharp exchange of passes with strike partner @entity44			0
minutes later , @entity1 fashioned their first chance when @entity55 's low goalbound shot was blocked by @entity35 and @entity51 fired the rebound just over			2
@entity10 reacts quickest to slot past @entity2 keeper @entity32 and score his 100th career goal on 19 minutes , the visitors went close again as @entity58 curled a free kick just wide			1
chances were at a premium in a cagey first half although @entity44 blasted wide after finding some rare space in the visitors ' penalty area just before the interval			0
five minutes after the restart , @entity2 had the home fans off their seats			2
a neat period of passing ended with @entity41 unleashing a stinging drive from 25 yards that the diving @entity50 did well to push away			0
minutes later , the hosts had a big shout for a penalty turned down after @entity39 's cross appeared to strike the arm of @entity52			0
after an initial bright start to the second half by @entity2 , it was against the run of play that @entity1 took the lead on 57 minutes			1
@entity10 has scored 15 goals in 25 championship games for @entity1 this season @entity51 's long ball was hopeful and should have been dealt with but @entity18 's header back was woefully short and @entity10 nipped in to push the ball over the onrushing @entity141			1
on the hour mark , @entity2 almost hit back when @entity41 's cross was flicked on by @entity43 but @entity44 's header was too tame to beat @entity50			2
at the other end , @entity32 saved from @entity57 after some great work by @entity58 before the same player found room to get his shot away but the @entity151 keeper saved low down to his right			0
@entity2 offered little in the final 20 minutes , until the game came back to life in injury time			2
@entity39 strikes an effort on goal , but @entity2 fail to extend their unbeaten run @entity20 was sent off for a second yellow , after hauling down @entity43 , before @entity50 saved @entity42 's fierce drive and @entity38 just failed to turn the ball in at the far post following a goalmouth scramble			1
it was the first time @entity2 had tasted defeat at @entity6 for almost five months but @entity1 just about deserved the three points as they stretched their own unbeaten run to five games .			1

@entity1 run out 1 - 0 winners at @entity6
@entity10 scores 100th career goal to end @entity2 's unbeaten run
@entity20 sent off in stoppage time for second bookable offence
@entity1 have won seven of their last 10 games
