@entity0 thinks his 50th goal for @entity2 could prove to be his most important yet			1
coming in the 86th minute of saturday 's match it was by no means his most spectacular , a mere flick from six yards out enough to take the ball past @entity7 after a scuffed @entity8 shot			2
but it was enough to defeat @entity10 in a frenetic match and breathe life back into the side he has spent his whole career playing for			2

i ’ve had a brilliant journey with this club			2
' i ’ve been on 49 for a long time , and i ’ve been in the @entity17 for a good few months now - i was hoping it would ’ve come earlier but i ’ve ticked that milestone off now and i ’m delighted about that			0
@entity50 admits @entity2 survival is still a ' big ask ' despite win over @entity10 @entity50 congratulates goalscorer @entity53 after the final whistle of his side 's win against the @entity10 ‘ but most importantly it was about getting the three points and we have a lot of work to do between now and the end of the season to make sure we ’re a @entity17 team next season			1
‘ we ’ve played well enough to prove we can survive and we ’ve not turned it into results - this is a results business			0
that proves to everyone - not just ourselves - that we mean business			0
’ @entity2 manager @entity50 praised @entity0 , who he brought off the bench with 12 minutes to play and said his team were finally getting the results they deserved after several games this season where they have drawn or lost despite dominating			1
