stuck : two boys discovered this robin chirping in distress after getting caught in a deadly superglue trap the wildlife charity today called for a ban on the glue traps in which extra-strong adhesive is spread onto boards to catch vermin			1
it was designed not to dry or lose its stickiness so catches any animal which comes along and can cause them a slow , lingering death , an @entity15 spokesman said			1
the bird was found struggling by the side of @entity33 in @entity34 , @entity35 , by the 12 - year - old schoolboys			1
inspector @entity37 said : ' this poor little robin was a pitiful sight when i first arrived - very distressed and sticky all over			2
without the caring attitude and diligence of these two young boys who knows how much longer it would have suffered ? injured : a grass snake died in a similar trap in @entity47 in @entity48 , @entity49 , after its scales were damaged ' it just shows how cruel and indiscriminate these traps can be			0
they catch any animal which happens along and this robin was lucky - usually those caught die a long and drawn out death			0
' despite the loss of tail feathers , the robin survived and was taken to a wildlife centre where it was later released back to the wild			0
a grass snake died in a similar trap in @entity47 in @entity48 , @entity49 , after its scales were irrevocably damaged			0
the @entity15 spokesman added it was an offence under the @entity67 to set these glue boards in a place where wild birds could be caught			1
however , it is legal to use them to catch rats and mice but anyone doing so was required to take precautions to avoid death or injury to wild birds or other protected animals .			0
