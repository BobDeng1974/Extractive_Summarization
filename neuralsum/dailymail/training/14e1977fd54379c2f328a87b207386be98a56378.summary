by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 05:55 est , 25 november 2013 updated : 07:03 est , 25 november 2013 seats should be ripped out on the most overcrowded train services to create cheaper ‘ standing only ’ carriages , ministers have been urged			1
the railways should follow the model of budget airlines like @entity10 and @entity11 who offer cheap , no - frills travel in contrast to the high - end services run by the likes of @entity16 or even private jets			1
passengers in the new economy class carriages would pay up to 20 per cent less than those sitting in standard class , under plans drawn up by the @entity23			1
future : @entity24 stands on a @entity26 train , which could be used as the model for seatless economy class services it is claimed that a return to third - class travel for the first time since 1956 would be a cheaper way to ease crowding than spending billions on new lines and stations			1
transport expert @entity36 , who wrote the report for the @entity23 , argues rail commuters should be given more choice about the quality of service and the price they pay			2
‘ an additional high - density “ economy class ” section could be introduced on commuter trains , access to which would be priced during the peak at a large discount to current fares			1
‘ from the resource cost point of view , there would be more passengers on a standard - length train without the recourse to high levels of taxpayer - funded investment in expensive new infrastructure			1
’ third class travel first became an option in 1838			2
six years later an act of parliament forced train companies to provide a roof in third class			0
the @entity66 stipulated that all third - class passengers should be carried in covered accommodation			1
railway companies also began providing lighting in third - class carriages			2
however , whereas there were several oil lamps in the first class carriages , third - class carriages only had one			2
in 1844 the railways introduced @entity77 for government workers			0
the @entity80 car , introduced in @entity81 in 1874 , created a new level of comfort			0
@entity84 abolished second class travel in 1875 , upgrading third class passengers to second class standards			1
other railways followed the example			0
second class disappeared from fare tables until 1956 , when third class was renamed second			0
@entity93 later renamed this standard class			0
passengers already crowd at the front of trains arriving at the final destination , even if there are empty seats at the rear , because they want to beat the crush at ticket barriers			2
the report proposes introducing an ‘ additional high - density section to commuter trains ’ of three carriages which would be 20 per cent cheaper than the standard peak price			1
‘ a discount of this amount would place the price of “ economy class ” about mid-way between the standard class rail fare and the fare for commuter coaches , ’ the report said			1
the discount could be less for shorter journeys and more for longer commutes			0
the carriages could be modelled on @entity26 trains service , with flip - down seats running down the edge but with most room giving over to standing space			1
it would mean trains could carry more people without investing in additional rolling stock or lengthening platforms			0
it could even be cheaper to run the new trains			2
‘ stripped of seat furniture train carriages would be lighter , ’ the report said			0
it would also be ‘ substantially ’ quicker for passengers to board and get off the train , with the potential to improve service reliability			0
it is claimed all passengers would enjoy the benefits of the new third class service			0
those choosing the economy class would save money , while those opting for a seat would ‘ enjoy higher service quality not having to share their space with standing passengers ’			1
it could mark the return of the drinks trolley to standard class carriages if overcrowding in the aisles was reduced			0
the report suggests the discounted ticket should not cost train companies money , because more passengers would be able to board each service			0
crush : the @entity23 argues that too many people are already forced to stand in carriages where seats take up too much space last month the @entity170 insisted it was not planning to reintroduce third - class travel after leaked plans to re-privatise the @entity174 main line from @entity175 to @entity176 included proposals for three different classes of travel			1
ministers have suggested it could be an additional class of travel between the existing first and standard classes – broadly equivalent to a ' premium economy ' class on airlines			2
transport secretary @entity187 also proposed stripping out first class carriages from busy routes to make more room for standard ticket holders .			0

trains could *replicate* @entity10 and easjet in offering no - frills travel
removing seats would create more room for passengers to stand
plan would be cheaper than spending billions on new lines and stations
@entity23 calls for high - density ' economy class '
