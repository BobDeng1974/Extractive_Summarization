@entity0 became the 11th @entity1 to play for a foreign club in the @entity3 when he was named in @entity4 's starting @entity5 , following in some illustrious footsteps			2
the likes of @entity8 and @entity9 have won the competition with @entity12 sides , while @entity13 had a high - profile stint at @entity15			1
we defy anyone , however , to remember @entity18 and @entity19 turning out for @entity20 against @entity21 in 1998			1
here , @entity22 looks at those 10 previous englishmen abroad ... @entity4 's @entity0 tries to get in between @entity24 and @entity25 in the @entity3 clash @entity0 was back on home soil and was impressive in @entity4 's draw at @entity29 @entity8 ( @entity15 ) converted from a tricky winger to a workhorse midfielder in @entity15 , @entity8 won the @entity3 twice with @entity15 , in 2000 and 2002			1
his finest moment came in the 2000 final against @entity34 , when he scored a spectacular scissors - style volley in a 3 - 0 victory for @entity15			0
@entity8 ( front ) with his winners ' medal after the 2000 @entity3 final @entity9 ( @entity42 ) ok , ok , @entity9 was born in @entity43 but by the time he won the tournament with @entity42 in 2001 he had already played for @entity45 , which is good enough for him to make it on this list			1
he was part of one of @entity42 's many dominant sides and forced himself into the full @entity45 team			0
he would later win the @entity3 again with @entity52			0
@entity9 won the @entity3 with @entity42 in 2001 , and here runs away from @entity15 's @entity54 @entity13 ( @entity15 ) the most famous footballer on the planet when he moved to @entity15 , @entity13 did not actually have much success at the @entity58			1
he won @entity59 in his final season but the @entity61 , of which he was part , did not reach the @entity3 semi-finals while he was there - a poor return for a team with such talent			0
@entity13 can not shake off @entity68 in @entity15 's last 16 clash with @entity42 in 2007 @entity70 ( @entity15 ) the striker had a solitary season at the @entity58 in 2004 - 05 , during which he was frequently used as a substitute			2
he scored his first @entity15 goal in the @entity3 , against @entity76 , but that was the only time he netted in @entity78 that season as @entity15 failed to get past the last 16			2
@entity70 celebrates his goal against @entity76 in 2004 , while @entity81 salutes his effort against @entity83 the following season @entity81 ( @entity15 ) one of @entity15 's more bizarre signings , @entity81 was hampered by injury ( he did not play at all during his first season ) and famously scored an own goal then was sent off on his debut			1
he did have a little more success in @entity78 and scored his only @entity15 goal in the @entity3 , against @entity83			2
@entity92 ( @entity93 ) this loan move in 2011 - 12 was meant to revive @entity0 's career but it did not quite succeed			0
he was overshadowed at the then - @entity97 champions by @entity98 and had limited impact in @entity78			0
he played six times for @entity93 in the @entity3 but did not score as the club finished bottom of their group			2
@entity92 ( left ) has a shot under pressure from @entity107 defender @entity106 while on loan at @entity93 @entity18 , @entity109 and @entity19 ( @entity20 ) it 's impossible not to lump these three in together as they all moved to @entity112 at around the same time			1
@entity109 and @entity19 were signed by @entity113 , while left back @entity18 joined the @entity112 giants under the previous boss @entity115			1
none of the trio made much impact in the @entity3			0
@entity109 scored in the first round against @entity120 but @entity20 did not make it beyond the group stage and @entity18 and @entity19 both played in a humbling 2 - 0 defeat by @entity21			1
@entity109 ( left ) and @entity18 both played for @entity20 in the @entity3 @entity19 holds off @entity125 's @entity124 during the fateful @entity3 campaign @entity127 ( @entity128 ) possibly the most bizarre addition on this list , seeing as he has never managed to hold down a regular starting spot in any @entity134 team , never mind one in the @entity3			1
but with his move to @entity128 in 2009 , he was given the opportunity to play in @entity78 's elite competition			0
he had domestic success in @entity140 but less on the continent , and was sent off against @entity142 in 2010			0
he is now at @entity143 @entity127 went from a peripheral figure at @entity145 to playing in @entity78 for @entity128			0

@entity8 and @entity9 both won @entity3 with foreign clubs
@entity149 , @entity70 and @entity81 represented @entity15
@entity18 , @entity109 and @entity19 played in @entity3 for @entity20
@entity92 played for @entity93 , @entity127 for @entity128
