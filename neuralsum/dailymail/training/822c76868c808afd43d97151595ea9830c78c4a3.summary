by @entity0 as the internet begins to exert more and more control over our lives , it brings with it an increasingly destructive problem - the rise of online porn			1
the issue is perhaps most damaging when it affects the lives of teenagers , who can be at risk of ruining their adolescence with an addiction to hardcore material			0
and some parents are taking drastic steps to reform their porn - addict sons - by sending them off to a desert ' boot camp ' to help them overcome their troubling behaviour			2
pioneering : @entity23 in @entity24 aims to tackle teenage boys ' ' sexual behavioural issues ' dorms : the teens are made to sleep in military - style bunk beds during their stay at the facility @entity23 , in @entity24 , is a rehabilitation facility dedicated to teenage boys who have exhibited ' sexual behavioural issues '			1
these ' issues ' can include a wide variety of problems - some of the boys there have been accused of voyeurism or even assaulting other children			2
but perhaps the fastest - growing category of offender is the online porn fanatic - leading some to dub the academy ' @entity46 ' , according to the @entity47			1
the pioneering facility is in a converted church , with inmates sleeping in bunk beds situated in two large dormitories			0
education : @entity54 has a number of high school teachers on its staff , and the boys attending several hours of schooling each day after undergoing therapy computer access : but the teens are blocked from all websites except online encyclopaedias when parents send their sons off to the $ 9,000 - a - month facility , they are committing the teens to a tough regime designed to shake them out of their destructive habits			1
around two dozen boys are subjected to therapy , chores - and , of course , a ban on phone and internet use			2
the teens , aged between 13 and 17 , must spend their days in counselling sessions , joined once a week by their parents via @entity81 - and after a full day of therapy , the boys attend academic classes until 9pm			1
the weekends are taken up with homework and chores such as laundry , although the troubled residents also get the chance to go horse riding in the wilderness around the town of @entity93 where @entity54 is located			0
while there are computers at the school , they are modified so that the only websites accessible from them are online encyclopaedias			2
dining room : the residents are subjected to a rural and simple lifestyle in the @entity24 wilderness group therapy : music is one of the extra-curricular activities intended to help them overcome their problems the teenagers are encouraged to open up about their past problems - and are even subjected to a lie detector test to ensure they are not concealing anything from the therapists			1
@entity112 , director of @entity23 , told the @entity47 that the boys - some of whom have been convicted of sex attacks - were like drug addicts going through withdrawal			1
' most porn addicts get agitated when they 're deprived of their online sources , ' he said			2
' but one boy from @entity122 actually got the shakes , like a drug abuser			0
he was in very poor shape when he arrived			0
he 'd been on his computer 10 to 12 hours a day looking at porn			1
' he was n't eating , he was dehydrated , had poor hygiene			0
he 'd done nothing but watch porn			0
' he is adamant that his school 's regime is the best way for teenagers to begin a life without online porn , and encourages them to ' disclose the most shameful stuff ' in an effort to move on from their past			1
obsession : addiction to internet porn is a growing threat to young people ( picture posed by model ) most boys at @entity54 stay for at least a year , and they frequently graduate high school from the facility , which employs several qualified teachers			1
mr @entity112 believes that the increasing sexualisation of modern culture means that places like his will become ever more popular among desperate parents			0
' sex is everywhere , ' he said			0
' when i was growing up if someone said they were bisexual it was shocking			0
' now threesomes and depraved sexual behaviour is all over the internet , and children see those images before they develop into adolescents			0

@entity23 is dedicated to tackling ' sexual behavioural issues '
@entity24 facility subjects teenage boys to hours of daily therapy as well as *normal* high school education
one inmate spent ' 10 to 12 hours a day ' watching online porn
