' @entity22 , who has shed around four fifths of her body weight also reveals why she stuck to the story that she had killed @entity12 , even after being charged with murder			1
she said : ' i tried to protect my sister , and i was already dying so i did n't see ... like i was doing [ something ] wrong			2
' ' i knew i was not doing right , but i was willing to give up my life for her			2
' @entity22 was found innocent after doctors revealed @entity12 could only have died from a blow to the head - which could not have been struck by @entity22 because she was too big to lift her arm			1

@entity12 had agreed to be a full - time carer when @entity0 became so large she struggled to walk			1

i was the one to blame			0
but only by accident , ' she explained			0
when her two - year - old nephew later died , @entity0 was arrested and charged with capital murder			0
@entity134 : it took ten men to remove @entity0 in a removal truck from her sister 's home in 2008 at her trial , the court heard that the fatal injuries sustained by the boy were consistent with a blow to the head and could not have been caused by someone falling on him			1
' it would have required her to have to swing her arm to strike the child on the head but she could never move her arm in that manner , ’ said @entity0 ’s lawyer @entity153			2
‘ we knew that her size was her best defence because she could n’t move her arm			0
' years of treatment : @entity0 posted this image on her @entity159 after undergoing weight loss surgery earlier this month despite the physical impossibility of @entity0 committing such a crime , the authorities had to conduct a full trial , with @entity0 as chief suspect			2
