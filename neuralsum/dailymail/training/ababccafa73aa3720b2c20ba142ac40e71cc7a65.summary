@entity1 diver @entity0 has launched his first official calendar and admits that he plans to try modelling in the future			1
@entity5 bronze medallist @entity0 , 18 , appears in a variety of poses - some of them shirtless and covered in water			1
but @entity0 has said his soon - to - be - released 2013 calendar is ' almost a bit of a mick take			1
' he said : ' the one on the front cover where i ’m covered in water was really funny to do			0
someone had to pound a bucket of water over me , it was n’t cold , it was sort of lukewarm			0
it took a few takes to get to get it right through because the water needed to be in the right place			0
' @entity0 's calendar is the third biggest seller of 2012 - despite being launched less than a month ago body beautiful : @entity0 shows off his honed torso in january 's image he continued : ' i ’m going to give it to all my friends at @entity37 , it will be a funny present			1
my friends all think the calendar is really funny			2
it ’s a mick take almost			2
it ’s the first calendar i ’ve done and it was good fun			0
i really enjoyed it and i just hope people like it			0
' apparently the @entity46 said there is a lot of interest in it			0

there are a couple of @entity1 - themed pictures so it ’s a good souvenir too			1
' body beautiful : @entity0 shows off his honed torso in january 's image hot : @entity0 shows off his saucy side in these images from his 2013 calendar although the 18 - year - old might look as if butter would n't melt in his mouth , some of the shots featured in the calendar reveal that he has a saucy side			1
among the photos are several shirtless shots , including one that sees him wrestling with a turquoise fine knit jumper			0
unsurprisingly though , @entity0 , of @entity74 , @entity75 , says his favourite picture falls on his birthday month of may , which shows him receiving his bronze medal at the @entity5			1
in total , nine of the twelve photos show off his toned , tanned torso , although three are action shots			0
the remaining images show off @entity0 's conservative sense of style , including a scrubbed up shot of the diver sporting a lilac cotton shirt			1
although @entity0 has never modelled in an advertising campaign , he 's no stranger to editorial photo shoots and has posed - in varying states of undress - for numerous @entity96 magazines and newspapers			2
