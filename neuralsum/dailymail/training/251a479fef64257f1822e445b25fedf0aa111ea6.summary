by @entity0 with just 300 people , the @entity1 might be @entity4 's tiniest tribe but they certainly know how to pack a punch - as the local crocodile population is all too well aware			1
for this band of hardy men and women are the original @entity10 and survived for centuries on a diet of the flesh of two of @entity16 's most dangerous beasts - the hippo and the @entity18 crocodile			1
sadly for the @entity1 , times ( and stiff anti-poaching laws ) have changed and the tribe is now forced to make a living from fish , although as photographer @entity28 explains , occasionally , one or two of @entity27 's 10,000 - strong crocodile population do still fall prey to their harpoons			1
tough guys : the 300 - strong @entity1 tribe is @entity4 's smallest but also one of its toughest thanks to their penchant for fighting crocodiles and even hippos bleak : they live on the shores of @entity27 , a semi-salty body of water surrounded by volcanic rocks and where temperatures reach up to 45 degrees @entity44 drinking water : although salty , the @entity1 continue to drink @entity27 's water although they do now have fresh water tanks built for them by the government changing times : the @entity1 are famous for their bravery within @entity4 and many are still animists , although some ( right ) have converted to @entity54 ' unlike neighbouring tribes such as the @entity27 and the @entity57 , the @entity1 are against killing people and raiding tor cattle , ' he explains			1
' they live almost exclusively on fish and occasionally some crocodiles from the lake , as the environment is too arid to raise cattle			1
' their fishing methods , which involve using small rafts made from doum palm trunks and harpoons , are more than 3,000 years old and usually result in the capture of one of the enormous 2ft catfish that live in the lake , or smaller tilapia			1
large though the catfish are , they 're small fry compared to the beasts the tribe used to take on - hippos			0
' before @entity4 introduced anti-poaching laws , they hunted hippos , ' explains @entity28			2
' the hippo hunter used to be celebrated as a hero and was given a special earring and a necklace to wear			2
' hippos , who kill more humans each year than any other creature in @entity16 , are also one of the most dangerous to hunt and as a result , the @entity1 are famous for their bravery			1
other animals on their menu include the crocodile , a favoured food for honoured guests , and although crocodiles are also officially protected , the @entity1 still occasionally kill one or two			1
tasty : the @entity1 used to be famous for their hippo hunts but are no longer allowed dangerous : hippos are one of the most dangerous animals in @entity16 and kill many humans creative : hunting and fishing is always done by the men while women are in charge of cooking not allowed : despite having made a living from hunting hippos for centuries , the animals are now protected by law and the @entity1 are not allowed to hunt them thirsty work : with hippo eating banned , the tribe lives mostly on the 2ft catfish that lurk beneath the lake which they turn into a salty broth using lake water traditional : their fishing techniques are more than 3,000 years old and involve using canoes made from doum palm trunks and handmade harpoons ageing : @entity1 people have a maximum life expectancy of 45 and consider 40 to be old ( left )			1
they also suffer from bone problems thanks to their protein only diet @entity137 in @entity138 sits in the heart of @entity27 tribal lands between @entity27 and the @entity141			2

for more information on visiting @entity4 , contact the @entity158 on 0207 367 0931 or visit @entity159 but while their diet is high in protein , the lack of fruit , vegetables and carbohydrates has led to health problems for the tribe , as has their penchant for drinking the salty water of @entity27			1
' you see many people with bone deformities , even in the kids , ' explains @entity28			0
' some adults are unable to walk because of painful bones			0
the situation is made worse because until recently , the tribe always married among themselves , which contributed to inbreeding			0
' they also suffer from a high fluoride intake , which makes their teeth discoloured , and they wo n't go to clinics because years ago , one of their people died in one			2
' because of that , they usually only live until the age of 45			2
40 years old is considered old in the tribe and they can look about 70			1
' and it 's not just the @entity1 themselves who are under threat , but their unique culture too			2
younger members of the tribe are starting to swap traditional clothes for western ones , while their language is now extinct and has been replaced with @entity203			0
' the last man to speak it died in 1974 , ' explains @entity28			0
' they had eight words just for the wind			0
' other parts of tribal culture , such as the clan system and a taboo that says it 's bad luck to speak the name of the dead remain			0
' they mix their traditions with @entity54 , ' adds @entity28			0
' it 's not unusual to see an @entity1 women wearing a tribal necklace and a cross at the same time			2
' despite embracing @entity54 and the modern world , with oil recently discovered close to @entity27 and its salinity increasing , the outlook looks bleak for the @entity1 , once @entity16 's bravest tribe			1
@entity227 : because of the arid conditions , the @entity1 spend a lot of time removing dust from each others eyes - as demonstrated here by two friends culture : although many still embrace traditional dress , many more are starting to wear western clothing , while the @entity1 language became extinct in 1974 small : the @entity1 tribe is so small , there are now only two villages - @entity243 and @entity245 - where homes are still made from dried reeds and doum palm leaves beautiful : the @entity1 live on the shores of @entity27 in an area dotted with volcanic rocks and where the land is too poor for agriculture or cows tasty : although they are n't really allowed , one or two of the 10,000 crocodiles living on @entity27 falls prey to @entity1 fisherman each year banned : the @entity1 are no longer allowed to hunt the hippo which live in @entity27 - a feat that earned them a reputation for bravery among other @entity4 tribes			1

the @entity1 live on the shores of @entity27 in *northern* @entity4 and live exclusively on fish and the odd crocodile
used to hunt the *extremely* dangerous hippo which resulted in a reputation for bravery among other @entity4 tribes
because of their tough *lifestyles* , they usually live to a maximum of 45 years old , while 40 is considered *ancient*
