as third in line to the throne , @entity0 will have been inundated with gifts from all over the world this @entity6			1
but the young royal is proving easy to please - one of his favourite festive presents cost under £ 10			2
@entity9 bought her 17 - month - old nephew a soft toy police car from @entity12 in @entity13 for just £ 9 and he is said to be delighted with the cuddly item			1
@entity0 is said to be particularly delighted with the gift the store owner @entity18 said : ‘ she was looking for a small gift because she ’d already bought him a massive thing			1
‘ she just needed something to give him to play with			0
' the soft toy police car was a top - up to a larger offering @entity9 had purchased for her nephew although @entity9 has yet to be pictured holding the prince , she has been very vocal about her adoration of the royal toddler			1
she told @entity31 programme the @entity32 in july : ' he 's amazing , a very dear boy			2
' he has brought a lot of pleasure and fun for all of us , the whole family			0
' despite her busy schedule , @entity9 pays regular visits to @entity0 and her sister @entity41 of @entity42 at their @entity44 apartment			1
the siblings have always been extremely close and @entity9 's frequent contact with her nephew shows that the @entity9 family are continuing with their attitude to strong family ties with the next generation			2
she said earlier this year : ' we spend a lot of time together			0
' we still do a lot together as a family			0
' and i think that 's really the heart for all of us is having a really close family that we can sort of be normal with each other , treat each other normally			0
' and that 's sort of kept us all , you know , affixed to the ground			0
' although @entity9 has yet to be pictured holding the prince , she has been very vocal about her adoration of the miniature royal although @entity9 has more contact with @entity0 than most of @entity70 and @entity72 's close friends , she was n't among the seven people chosen as his godparent			1
it is thought that the royal couple believed she was struggling to cope with the amount of public attention she has received since the royal wedding and they felt the new role would pile on even more pressure			0
@entity9 is widely expected to be named as a godmother to @entity70 's second child though , which is due in april .			2
