it said : ' the severity of the turbulence created by the wind , close to the summit of @entity9 , was such that it exceeded the safe conditions for flight in the microlight			1
' this resulted in a loss of control which led to the impact close to the summit of the mountain			0
' the report said the video showed the flight path had been stable up to a point about 300 metres from the summit			0
it went on : ' at this point the aircraft started to roll rapidly from left to right and pitched nose - down			0
' the @entity39 added that the increase in engine power ' suggests the pilot was trying to arrest his rate of descent and climb out of the turbulence '			0
the report said a witness on the top of @entity9 saw the last moments of the aircraft 's flight and had described the wind at the summit as ' very strong '			2
