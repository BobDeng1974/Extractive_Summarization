@entity25 , 48 , deputy head of @entity28 's local council in @entity9 , and the man behind the new park said : ' we are building the @entity10 now , and of course there will be a chance for people who come here to see creature			1
for me having @entity2 here means something much more than the simple tourist attraction '			0

we will organise a museum , exhibiting all @entity2 - related objects , like the trees they make into arches , and many other things			1

insistence : @entity25 is the man behind the park			1
he claims that the yeti is an ' extraterrestrial creature ' that looks over things ' on @entity74 ' and when i saw the yeti 's eyes my only thought was that they are not from @entity74 - they are clearly of an extraterrestrial nature			1

i believe that it is like a controller to look over things here on @entity74			0
' mr @entity25 added that the creature - known as @entity87 by locals - could ' suddenly disappear and re-materialise ' he added : ' another extraordinary thing is that yeti 's hair is luminous at night , and also that the @entity2 can walk on water			1
' every man round here sees him when he hunts			2
it 's all right to mention the fact of meeting - but we do n't go into the details of it , like where exactly it was , what he did do , or your luck will be gone			2
tourism : the park will be located in the @entity11 ski resort in the @entity112 area of @entity113 in southern @entity9 ' the feeling is one of fear			0
it is a fear that you can not explain rationally			0
you feel yourself very scared and tense at the same time			0
' one of the closest comparisons is the feeling of looking into a wolf 's eyes			2
if you 've ever seen them - i mean a wild wolf , not a caged animal - you remember a feeling of them being something very unusual , alien			0
' like with a wolf , you can see a yeti 's eyes from a distance of some 100 - 150 metres			1
