by @entity0 divorce battle : dr @entity2 is involved in an ' acrimonious divorce ' battle with her ex-husband and his family - particularly his mother - over a £ 10million chain of dental practices a ‘ strong mutual antipathy ’ between a millionairess dentist and her former mother - in - law is at the heart of a bitter divorce battle , a court heard yesterday			1
the dispute over the family business – divided up after the couple ’s separation – involves not only the woman ’s ex-husband but his ‘ controlling ’ mother			0
@entity2 , 36 , and her 45 - year - old former husband @entity22 , worked together running their ‘ niche ’ dentistry business and are believed to have had assets worth up to £ 10million			1
they raised two children together as their empire of 12 practices spread across @entity31 and the @entity32			0
and when the couple divorced last year , mrs @entity2 took ownership of seven of them.but now mr @entity37 and his ‘ strong - willed ’ mother @entity37 have insisted that five of those surgeries belong to them			1
the fight has resulted in an atmosphere of ‘ unremitting hostility ’ between the divorcee , her ex-husband and his family – particularly the older mrs @entity2 , judges were told			2
last year @entity2 claimed she owned seven of the 12 successful dental practices , and family judge mr justice @entity50 , ruled in her favour			2
the mother - of - two said she had started a parallel company , to escape ‘ interference ’ in her commercial affairs by her ‘ dominant and highly controlling mother - in - law ’			1
@entity57 , his mother and his brother @entity59 are now asking three judges at @entity31 ’s @entity61 to return ownership to them			0
representing @entity2 , @entity63 , told the court : ‘ the wife is a dentist and it is common ground that she owns two practices			2
‘ the beneficial ownership of five other practices has , however , been the subject of dispute between the parties			0
’ businessman @entity57 , 45 , pictured left outside @entity31 's @entity61 , and his wife dr @entity2 , right , are fighting out who owns which practices the barrister said the younger mrs @entity2 acquired three practices in @entity81 , one in @entity31 and one in @entity83 , @entity84 , when she was a director of the family dental business			1
she had done that because she feared her formidable mother - in - law ‘ controlling ’ her and wanted to leave the marriage with her business interests intact , mr @entity86 added			1
referring to the initial hearing , he said : ‘ mr justice @entity50 found that , at the heart of the case , lay a strong mutual antipathy between two very strong - willed women , the husband ’s mother @entity95 , and the wife			1
dr @entity2 claims she is entitled to beneficiary ownership of five of the family 's 12 practices , on top of the two she already owns ' @entity95 had been the driving force of the @entity2 family businesses and she held a dominant and highly controlling position within the @entity2 family			1
’ he added that the older mrs sharma ‘ expected deference from her family , which she regarded as her due , both as a mother and one of the founders of the family fortune ’			0
but the court heard that @entity2 was ‘ aware of her mother - in - law ’s control ’ so obtained ‘ fully informed consent by all the joint venturers to her acquiring new dental practices for her own account ’			1
@entity123 , representing @entity57 and his family , argued that @entity2 had acted unlawfully in acquiring the five practices for her own company while still ‘ wearing the hat ’ of a director of the @entity2 family business			2
he told the judges that the family ’s ‘ financial standing ’ had allowed the practices to succeed and that she owed the business a duty of loyalty			0
adding that @entity2 was ‘ a daughter - in - law for whom [ @entity37 ] had no warm feelings , ’ mr @entity137 argued that the younger woman had breached duty of trust			1
mr @entity86 said @entity2 had ‘ acted honestly and reasonably ’ and should not be made to hand over the five practices she had worked so hard to establish			2
‘ @entity95 was in complete control of the @entity2 family businesses			0
if @entity2 fell out with @entity95 , she would be vulnerable , ’ he told the court			0
‘ @entity95 agreed that @entity2 would have full control [ of the five practices ] without any interference			0
‘ the success of the business relied entirely on @entity2 , the only qualified dentist and the driving force of the business			1
’ in last year ’s hearing , which was decided in the younger mrs @entity2 ’s favour , mr justice @entity50 said that the family had ‘ lived with this case for many months of unremitting hostility ’			0
he added : ‘ the two sides are very suspicious of each other and highly antagonistic			0
’ the @entity61 judges have reserved their judgment on the case , which will be delivered at a later date .			0
