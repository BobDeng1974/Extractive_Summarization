by @entity0 to celebrate the first birthday of the nation 's beloved @entity3 , @entity1 launched a picture competition last week , asking readers to nominate their little lookalike princes ( and princesses )			1
the response was phenomenal and we received thousands of entries , from those who looked scarily similar to @entity13 , to those who were perhaps long lost cousins			2
we even had a few parents who tried to enter themselves as @entity17 and @entity17 doppelgängers ! however , our hunt is over , and we have found a baby so alike to @entity20 that he ought to start practicing a finger painting signature			0
meet @entity22 , an 11 month - old from @entity23 , who beat hundreds of hopefuls and today claims the crown of the best @entity3 lookalike			1
the two boys are also of very similar ages meaning that their height and body stature is almost identical			0
however , the most noticeable similarity between the two babies was the prominent eyebrows that both boys have , with @entity13 taking after his father @entity51			2
@entity52 , @entity30 's mother , says that like @entity3 , @entity30 has just started to take his first steps			0
separated at birth ? the judging panel agreed that both @entity30 ( left ) and @entity3 ( right ) shared the same chubby cheeks and bold eyebrows ' he 's very energetic like the @entity41 and just starting on his feet , ' she said			1
she adds that her little prince is already a bit of a connoisseur when it comes to dinner time			0
' @entity30 is a very loveable cuddly boy but he has very picky taste already in food ! he can never get enough of cheese sandwiches ! there has to be always one in his hand			0
' when it comes to entertainment @entity30 has to do without royal tours and stuffed bilbys but has developed a taste for the high tech. drooling with delight : @entity30 pulls the perfect @entity13 pout at his baptism they could be twins ! @entity30 ( left ) and @entity13 ( right ) share the same fair hair , curious expression and cheeks ' @entity85 is a show that keeps him occupied the whole day and he 's already tech savvy enough to try and turn on the episodes on my @entity87			1
' it is n't just the @entity90 who have picked up on the identical features of the two boys , @entity52 says that friends constantly compare her son to the young prince			0
' since i have put his pictures up everyone has noticed the similarities so it would be something very special for him to be remembered as prince @entity13 's 1 year old birthday doppelgänger ! ' the competition was extremely close and although @entity30 was our clear winner we had a lot of entries from babies who will surely be practising their @entity3 pout for years to come			1
see some of our other favourite entries below ... @entity113 , 9 months old , from @entity114 @entity115 , 10 months old , from @entity116 ( left ) and @entity117 , 10 months old , from @entity118 ( right ) @entity13 , 7 months old , from @entity119 @entity120 , 8 months old , from @entity23 @entity121 , 7 months old ( left ) and @entity122 , 10 months old , from @entity23 ( right ) @entity117 , 15 months old , from @entity123 @entity124 , one year old , from @entity118 ( left ) @entity120 , 10 months old , from @entity23 ( right ) @entity125 , 9 months old , from @entity126 @entity127 , 8 months old , from @entity128 ( left ) and @entity129 , one year old , from @entity130 ( right )			2
