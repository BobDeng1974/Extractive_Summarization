' @entity35 , the @entity36 's @entity3 campaign manager labelled the statement an ' extremely manipulative and deceptive argument ' , as the @entity3 government had only recently expanded four wheel drive tracks over sacred @entity20 middens in the north - west of the area			1
@entity3 's @entity45 government provided $ 300,000 for the controversial development , which would see 90 kilometers of track upgraded and reopened , reported the @entity48			2
the move was met with outrage by the @entity20 community , as the area was home to countless rock engravings , middens , and hut depressions			0

' ' the draft plan is about achieving balanced outcomes that are genuinely respectful of cultural and natural values , while at the same time recognising that the @entity78 is an area to be used , celebrated and shared with the world , ' mr @entity90 said			0
while the official title will remain unchanged , mr @entity35 has labelled the proposal a threat to the integrity of the iconic landscape of the state			2
' doing away with the wilderness zone impacts on the credibility and integrity of the brand of @entity3 , and our state 's claim as wilderness , ' he said			1
mr @entity35 said that the state trades on the ' idea of wilderness ' , and that it was a key motivating factor for people to visit			0

' ' the label is central to @entity3 's identity			2
if the wilderness zone no longer has protection , that is an attack on the brand			0
we actively promote ourselves with that label , it 's on everything , ' he said			0

@entity172 , seen from @entity173 , @entity3 's highest mountain on the overland track in @entity75 , @entity76 swamp gums , seen above , are the tallest flowering plants in the world , seen in the @entity179 also called eucalyptus regnans , the hardwood trees live to be hundreds of years old ' the @entity3 government is seeking to facilitate sensible and appropriate recreational experiences including new tourism opportunities through the @entity186 process , ' said mr @entity90			1
' this plan is all about managing the area properly while ensuring we can use it to generate tourism and jobs , ' he said			0
several of the objectives included in the draft include ' commercial opportunities ' , ' the support of management through tourism ' , and ' the balanced use of aircraft '			0
the draft states that the @entity3 government acknowledges the ' important role tourism plays in contributing to the economic wellbeing of the @entity3 community			1
' mr @entity35 said that the changes showed a lessening of the state government 's commitment to protect the area , shown through the removal of the pledge included in the previous management plan to ' strive to maintain the property and leave it in as good or better quality than it was found '			0

the @entity36 has labelled the move as driven by development
the draft proposes tourism development , helicopter access and logging
the @entity36 has *slammed* the changes , claiming it *undermines* the identity of the state
