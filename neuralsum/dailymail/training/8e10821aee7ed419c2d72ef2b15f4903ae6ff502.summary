the @entity14 press hit back on friday morning saying : ' he scores two goals in a friendly and already they are scared of him			2
' @entity2 ’s double against an @entity19 under - 19 xi on wednesday was the highlight of his first competitive 90 minutes since the @entity21			1

his first match back will be @entity24 's @entity1 clash with @entity5 at the @entity36 on october 24 @entity2 scored twice for @entity37 in a friendly with @entity19 under 19 on wednesday the @entity14 press hit back at their @entity5 counterparts by claiming they were running scared of @entity2 under the watchful eye of fitness coach @entity42 , @entity2 has been building his fitness since july but was forced to do so far from the club ’s @entity45 training complex			1

@entity51 said in his press conference : ' @entity2 , fat ? he is a naturally stocky player			2
he is at his ideal weight and he is ready to compete			0
if you want we 'll give him liposuction but i do n't think he needs it			0
' @entity2 has worked tirelessly on his musculature – a process that started when he had to build strength around his injured left knee to make it to the @entity69 @entity21			2
now he needs to add that lightness of turn and burst of pace that only full matches can bring			0
