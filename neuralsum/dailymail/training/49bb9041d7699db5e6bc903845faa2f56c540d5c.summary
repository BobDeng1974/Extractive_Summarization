their massed ranks responded with tear gas , stun grenades — one of which was reported to have blown off a marcher ’s hand — and , fatally , shotguns			1

like a scene from hell , flames engulfed @entity5 this week as thousands of masked protesters hurled rocks and @entity9 cocktails at heavily armed riot police police have responded to the protestors with tear gas , stun grenades and , fatally , shotguns it was the most violent exchange yet , following weeks of clashes during which hundreds of thousands of protesters have thronged the streets of @entity40 ’s capital , yearning to overthrow their authoritarian , @entity42 government			1
now , as heavy snow blankets the city , they continue to defend their barricades , claiming they are ready to fight ‘ to the end ’			0
opposition leaders have issued an ultimatum to the president , @entity51 , to call early elections in the coming days and scrap new anti-protest laws , or face further violence			1
the most iconic figure to emerge as a rallying point for the uprising is the world heavyweight boxing champion @entity59 , his hulking 6ft 7in frame a steely symbol of defiance at the heart of the demonstrations			1
yet he has not been reckless in his rhetoric			0
last night , the pugilist - turned - politician — whose fans call him dr @entity59 because he has a doctorate in sports science — was reported to have urged protesters to observe an eight - hour truce ahead of talks with president @entity51			1
‘ i will return to you and inform you of the result of the talks , ’ he was quoted as telling protesters			0
‘ keep the barricades in place , but be calm until the talks finish			0
’ only a few weeks ago , his followers — who long to see true democracy flourish in this troubled nation — seemed to be winning this brutal battle of wills			1
they managed to topple a giant statue of @entity84 — hated symbol of the repressive @entity87 regime — hammering it to pieces in scenes of rage and defiance that revealed the strength of @entity94 feeling among many @entity95			2
but now , as we saw this week , the regime is determined to crush them			0
this is not merely a matter of internal @entity40 politics			1
the battle for @entity5 also symbolises @entity104 ’s latest — and most audacious — bid to regain a hold over its former empire			1
@entity107 , the @entity108 hard man in the @entity109 , has muzzled his own country ’s media , cowed its courts and turned its political institutions into shells			2
and now he wants more			0
the countries of the former empire must do things @entity104 ’s way , too			1
the most iconic figure to emerge as a rallying point for the uprising is the world heavyweight boxing champion @entity59 ( pictured ) @entity107 , the @entity108 hard man in the @entity109 , has muzzled his own country 's media , cowed its courts and turned its political institutions into shells			1
and now he wants more			0
the countries of the former empire must do things @entity104 's way , too protestors throw stones and burning tyres amid clashes between riot police and demonstrators the @entity40 regime , bailed out by the @entity109 last year with cheap gas and loans , has now passed a bundle of repressive laws to cripple protest and opposition — just as in @entity140			1
but @entity95 do not want to live in the @entity109 ’s shadow			2
desperate to escape their @entity87 past , they yearn for the same legal rights , prosperity and freedom we enjoy in @entity147			0
sadly , they have been let down by their corrupt and incompetent rulers , who , acting as @entity107 ’s puppets , refused last autumn to sign a trade agreement with the @entity153			2
the @entity153 had been negotiating for closer links with @entity40 and five other @entity156 states for a year			1
but the deal fell apart at a summit in october			0
instead , the thuggish @entity40 leader turned to @entity104			1
one great danger now is that the crackdown succeeds in @entity40 , and that its military forces effectively become integrated with @entity104 ’s resurgent army			1
that would put the @entity109 ’s advanced weapons within striking distance of @entity147 , and of vital @entity168 trade routes such as the @entity170 strait in @entity171 , which links @entity147 and @entity172			0
as the @entity175 statesman and geopolitics expert @entity173 has said : ‘ without @entity40 , @entity104 ceases to be an empire ; but with @entity40 subordinated , @entity104 automatically becomes an empire			1
’ for their part , many @entity104 people have watched @entity40 protests with awe and envy			1
their own opposition movement has fizzled out — steamrollered by the ruthless @entity104 authorities			1
yet many of them yearn for the modern , democratic life that we and 500 million others in @entity147 take for granted			0
two protesters fell dead after being hit by bullets , one of having been hit in the head , neck and chest during the protests opposition leaders have issued an ultimatum to the president , @entity51 , to call early elections in the coming days and scrap new anti-protest laws , or face further violence mr @entity107 and his cronies have looted tens of billions of dollars in the past decade from the hapless @entity104 nation			1
people who stand in their way are jailed , killed or exiled			0
but to feel truly safe at home , the @entity109 also needs to feel safe abroad			0
@entity104 joke that the definition of a secure frontier is one with @entity104 troops on both sides			1
as @entity95 ’ dreams of democracy and independence begin to perish in the blood - stained snows of @entity5 , that prospect is coming closer by the day			1
for @entity107 wants to entrench his rule not only in @entity104 but in neighbouring countries with a new @entity220			1
its name even apes that of the @entity153			0
but in mr @entity107 ’s planned union , the @entity109 ’s word will rule			0
he will deal not with ordinary voters but with men like @entity40 ’s mr @entity51 , or the strongman leader of @entity229 , @entity230 , another friend of the @entity109			1
with the right mixture of threats and inducements , such men will do his will			0
and @entity107 will not stop at @entity40			2
he has imposed arbitrary trade sanctions on other countries which dare resist him , too , including @entity239			0
others are bribed into submission			0
he has just struck a deal with @entity243 , offering its ruler , @entity244 , cheap gas in exchange for a contract to build a power station there			0
a similar deal is brewing in @entity251			0
step by step , @entity104 is using the cudgel of its vast energy resources to restore power and influence in the lands it once ruled by force			2
and the @entity94 seems powerless to resist			0
already , @entity259 can scarcely defend the brave but beleaguered allies we have in the area : @entity263 , @entity264 and @entity239			0
and @entity104 and its satellite @entity229 regularly rehearse plans for the invasion and occupation of these @entity270 countries			2
@entity104 ’s forces have even practised a nuclear attack on @entity273			1
this is not merely a matter of internal @entity40 politics			2
the battle for @entity5 also symbolises @entity104 's latest - and most audacious - bid to regain a hold over its former empire the bitter irony is that the @entity153 has huge powers to resist @entity104 — if it chooses to use them			1
it ’s humbled giant corporations such as @entity285 for mistreating @entity168 consumers , imposing huge fines when it considered the company was abusing its market position			0
it must do the same with @entity290 , @entity104 ’s gas company , which throttles countries that resist the @entity109 by extorting high prices for gas sent over its monopolised pipelines			1
a ‘ complaint ’ — @entity153 jargon for a prosecution — is imminent			0
it could lead to billions of dollars in fines for the @entity104 gas giant			1
@entity301 and other countries should applaud that — and ensure that the @entity305 lobby in @entity306 does not try to derail it			0
@entity147 should also respond to the trade sanctions @entity104 has imposed on its neighbours , which are a flagrant breach of international rules			2
but the @entity153 is instinctively unwilling to play geopolitics , and the idea of standing up to @entity104 is seen as confrontational and unnecessary			2
yet geopolitics is being played in front of our eyes in @entity40 and beyond — and we are losing			1
we need to punish mr @entity51 and his regime for their thuggish behaviour			2
we need to stand by @entity95 , who ask for nothing more than a chance to embrace the @entity323 values of liberty and justice in their own country			0
controversially , i believe that if , under a future @entity94 government , @entity40 meets our economic standards , it should have the right to join the @entity153			2
it might take a decade or more ; but only that hope will spur change — and thwart the sinister ambitions of the brooding ogre in the @entity109			0
for now , the @entity323 nations seem powerless in @entity40			2
yet we could impose sanctions on mr @entity51 and his henchmen , many of whom run murky business empires at home while also swanning around in luxury and respectability in @entity346			2
investigations of their finances , and a ban on their families gaining visas to the @entity94 , would send a powerful signal			0
@entity95 are fighting and dying for our values			0
but through our inaction , we are colluding with their oppressors			0
as @entity95 ' dreams of democracy and independence begin to perish in the blood - stained snows of @entity5			2
