the @entity0 have booked themselves a second @entity2 grand final appearance in three years with a hard fought victory against the @entity4			1
tries to @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 - with three conversations from @entity10 - were enough to see the dogs progress 18 - 12 over the men from western @entity13 and cement their place against much fancied opponents , the @entity13 , next sunday			1
captain @entity16 could be in doubt for the @entity19 blockbuster after he left the field at half time with a foot injury , however his absence only made the gutsy men in blue and white dig deeper in front of a crowd of 46,168			2
@entity4 set up a thrilling finish when flying winger @entity29 cut the margin to six with eight minutes left , but in the end were left to rue three critical @entity33 mistakes			0
inspirational @entity0 prop @entity6 proved too strong , scoring a try and leading his fellow troops around the park			0
the @entity0 made their last grand final appearance in 2012 where their premiership campaign was cut cruelly short by @entity39			2
they last tasted success a decade ago against the @entity41 , and will be hoping to deliver coach @entity42 his second win at the helm after he moved from @entity45 in 2012			0

the @entity0 won 18 - 12 against the @entity4 at @entity19 on saturday night
it was played in front of a a crowd of 46,168 , *slightly* less than last night 's blockbuster between @entity13 and @entity41
@entity0 will go in as *underdogs* against the @entity13 who *defeated* the @entity41 on *friday* night
it will be @entity0 's second grand final in two years and their third since *defeating* the @entity41 in 2004
