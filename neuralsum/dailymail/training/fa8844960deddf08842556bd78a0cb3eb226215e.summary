by @entity0 last updated at 5:57 am on 12th december 2011 the bloody drug war in @entity2 shows no sign of relenting			1
neither do calls for tighter border security amid rising fears of spillover violence			0
this hardly seems a time the @entity10 would be willing to allow people to cross the border legally from @entity2 without a customs officer in sight			1
but in this rugged , remote @entity20 terrain where wading across the shallow @entity17 undetected is all too easy , federal authorities are touting a proposal to open an unmanned port of entry as a security upgrade			1
easy crossing : @entity26 , wades into the shallow @entity17 across from @entity27 , @entity20 on october 31 by the spring , kiosks could open up in @entity27 allowing people from the tiny @entity2 town of @entity31 to scan their identity documents and talk to a customs officer in another location , at least 100 miles ( 160 kilometres ) away			1
the crossing , which would be the nation 's first such port of entry with @entity2 , has sparked opposition from some who see it as counter-intuitive in these days of heightened border security			1
supporters say the crossing would give the isolated @entity2 town long - awaited access to @entity10 commerce , improve conservation efforts and be an unlikely target for criminal operations			1
@entity53 , @entity27 's superintendent , explained : ' people that want to be engaged in illegal activities along the border , ones that are engaged in those activities now , they 're still going to do it			1
but you 'd have to be a real idiot to pick the only place with security in 300 miles ( 480 kilometres ) of the border to try to sneak across			2
' security upgrade : federal authorities are touting a proposal to open an unmanned port of entry in this @entity20 terrain where it is easy to wade across the @entity17 the proposed crossing from @entity31 leads to a vast expanse of rolling scrub , cut by sandy - floored canyons and violent volcanic rock outcroppings			1
the @entity76 desert wilderness is home to mountain lions , black bears and roadrunners , sparsely populated by an occasional camper and others visiting the 800,000 - acre ( 320,000 - hectare ) national park			0
@entity84 , which would run the port of entry , says the proposal is a safe way to allow access to the town 's residents , who currently must travel 240 road miles ( 390 road kilometres ) to the nearest legal entry point			1
it also would allow park visitors to visit the town			0
if the crossing is approved , the @entity96 would have eight agents living in the park in addition to the park 's 23 law enforcement rangers			1
' i think it 's actually going to end up making security better , ' @entity84 spokesman @entity103 said			2
' once you 've crossed you 're still not anywhere			0
you 've got a long ways to go and we 've got agents who are in the area			0
we have agents who patrol			0
we have checkpoints on the paved roads leading away from the park			0
' a public comment period runs through december 27 on the estimated $ 2.3million project , which has support at the highest levels of government from both countries			0
rugged : handicrafts made in @entity31 , @entity2 across the @entity17 await tourists at an overlook in @entity27 , @entity20 but @entity10 representative @entity125 , a @entity20 @entity126 member of the @entity127 , questioned the wisdom of using resources to make it easier to cross the border			1
' we need to use our resources to secure the border rather than making it easier to enter in locations where we already have problems with illegal crossings , ' mr @entity125 said in an email			0
' there is more to the oversight of legal entry than checking documents			1
( @entity84 ) needs to be physically present at every point of entry in order to inspect for contraband , detect suspicious behaviour and , if necessary , act on what they encounter			2
' while @entity84 will run the port of entry , the @entity150 is the driver behind the project , which it hopes will help conservation efforts on both sides of the border			1
even as the @entity150 has increased cooperation with its @entity2 counterpart , joint conservation has been limited by the inability of personnel to cross the border without making a circuitous 16 - hour drive , @entity53 said			1
so the @entity150 is building the contact station just above the @entity17			0
it will house @entity84 kiosks where crossers will scan in their documents and talk to a customs officer in @entity169 , the nearest port of entry , or another remote location			1
park service employees will staff the station , offering information about the park and guiding people through the process			2
work underway : machinery operators in @entity27 , @entity20 work on a planned remotely - operated port of entry at the @entity17 similar ports of entry are already in operation on remote parts of the border with @entity185			1
' we think we can do this without doing any damage to national security and possibly enhance security along the border by having better intelligence , better communication with people in @entity2 , ' mr @entity53 said			1
the crossing would also restore a long - running relationship between the park , its visitors and the residents of @entity31 , the town of adobe dwellings set a short distance from the river in @entity2			1
for years , @entity10 tourists added an international dimension to their park visit by wading or ferrying in a rowboat across the shallow @entity17 to the town			0
there they bought handicrafts and tacos , providing much - needed cash in the isolated community			0
but @entity10 officials discouraged such informal crossings in 2002 after the september 11 terrorist attacks prompted calls for tighter border security			0
without access to tourists or supplies on the @entity10 side , the town of just more than 100 people has seen a 42 percent drop in population from 2000 to 2010			1
@entity225 , who manages the @entity226 at a nearby park campground , recalls many @entity2 residents crossing the river to pick up groceries and other necessities			1
' we 're their supply , ' mr @entity225 said			0
' they do n't have any electricity over there			0
so they would come here and buy frozen chicken , cake mixes and things that they could n't get over there			0
' mr @entity225 tried to stock food items @entity31 residents wanted , such as eggs and big sacks of beans			1
' after the border closed , well , i got rid of most of my food and went back to gifts because i was n't making any money , ' mr @entity225 said			0
he estimated about 40 per cent of the store 's revenue came from @entity257 residents			2
few have risked crossing to the store since			2
' if they get caught over here they get shipped off , ' he said			0
' they get deported all the way to @entity264 and then they 've got to find their way home			0
it 's not really worth it			2
' still , most days some @entity31 residents wade across the river a short distance downstream of the old crossing and scramble up to a paved overlook perched high above the river			1
on boulders near the parking spots they lay out painted walking sticks , scorpions and roadrunners crafted from copper wire and colourful beads			0
each craftsman 's work occupies a different rock and operates on the honour system with the hope tourists will drop four or five dollars in their jar			2
' sometimes we do n't sell anything , ' said @entity31 resident @entity26			1
" sometimes we sell one			0
" and other times authorities confiscate everything			0
mr @entity294 , a 34 - year - old father of three , described his town as ' very sad , very hard ' and said there was no work			0
without access to the @entity226 , residents depend on a bus that runs once a week to @entity301 , a larger town about 150 miles ( 240 kilometers ) away , for supplies			2
a small military presence protects the town from the drug - related violence that has engulfed other @entity2 border towns			1
now with news of the port of entry , residents are already making plans for restaurants and shops , he said			2
' when it closed nobody crossed and everything went downhill			0
people began to leave , ' he said			2
' now people are going to return			2

kiosks could open up between @entity27 and @entity31
people would scan their identity documents and talk to nearest customs officer stationed at least 100 miles away
crossing would be the nation 's first such port of entry with @entity2
