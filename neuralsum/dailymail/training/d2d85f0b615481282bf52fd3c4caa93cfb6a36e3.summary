created : 20:03 est , 13 april 2014 @entity0 remembers the day her mother prepared her for a ritual @entity3 sacrifice , cutting her throat with a kitchen knife and preparing to roast her in the oven of the family home in the small @entity9 town of @entity10			1
it was the @entity12 weekend in january 1989 , when @entity0 was two years old and the only child of parents @entity15 and @entity16 who were @entity17			1
@entity15 knew that @entity16 had lately been praying more , but he was utterly unaware his wife was slipping into her first psychotic episode			2
survivor : @entity0 wore a tracheostomy on her neck ( above ) from the age of two until she was 13 years old after her own mother slit her throat and prepared to roast her in the family oven as a a sacrifice in an @entity3 ritual after ' voices ' told @entity16 to kill her child miraculous : @entity0 still remmebers her mother ' boiling the knives ' for her ritual sacrifice and then coming at her to slit her throat			1
father @entity32 ( pictured , above , with @entity0 in hospital ) tearfully recalls seeing her for the first time after the attack when she wrapped herself around him ' like a koala ' @entity16 had apparently been reading the @entity3 book of @entity38 , and in particular the verses in which @entity39 is instructed to sacrifice his only son , @entity42			1
' i can remember her boiling the knives , ' @entity0 , now 27 , said of the fateful day 25 years ago			1
her mother had dressed the toddler in clean pyjamas , ' anointed ' her in oil as per the @entity49 passage , and laid her out on a sheepksin rug on a tea chest in the kitchen			1
' i remember the knife coming down towards my face and i remember putting my hands up to stop it , ' @entity0 told @entity57			1
@entity16 cut right through her daughter 's laryngeal nerves which connected to her vocal cords			1
as per the @entity49 story in which @entity39 prepared to make his son @entity42 a ' burnt offering ' on a wooden altar , @entity16 was preparing to put her daughter into the oven			1
' she told me that she ’d held @entity0 ’s head till @entity0 turned blue , which was about 40 minutes , ' @entity32 said			1
the voices had told her that it was an impure sacrifice and to put her into the oven straight away			2
' [ but ] there must have been part of the sanity still there because she argued with those thoughts and said " no. she ’s not dead yet – i ca n’t put her in the oven until she ’s dead " , ' mr @entity32 said			2
' she understands that she came out of that psychotic episode and realised – but was n’t really sure – that she ’d done something wrong			2
so she rang the @entity10 police station and said , " i think i ’ve done something wrong – i ’ve just cut my daughter ’s throat " , ' he said			1
' i ... remember being on the ambulance bed outside our house , ' ' it was a very sunny day and i just have this vague memory of looking down at myself			2
' mr @entity32 rushed home to find his wife being carted off by police and his daughter to hospital in an ambulance to @entity96 where , luckily , a skilled medical team had been summoned			2
the police said ' your wife just slit your daughter 's throat			1
[ they ] asked about my religion and the @entity104 case			0
' police later ' hushed up ' the attack , fearful of attracting the storm of negative publicity which had accompanied the 1980 case in the @entity12 outback , when a dingo took the infant daughter of @entity17 couple @entity104 and @entity114 , and @entity104 was jailed ( and later exonerated ) for ' sacrificing ' her baby @entity115			1
they also wished to protect the family 's privacy			2
@entity0 's oesophagus was repaired and she was given a tracheostomy , in which an exterior tube is inserted to allow her to breathe			1
despite the excellent medical care which saved her life , @entity0 was not expected to talk again			2
@entity32 still weeps as he recalls the moment he got to see his daughter , who had been flown to @entity126 for treatment			2
' the nurse said , " look , here 's your @entity130 "			0
she shot round and her arms went straight around me and she latched on like a koala bear and would n't let go			0
she just wanted her @entity130			0
' @entity0 can still recall the blue stitches in her fingers , on the defensive wounds when she held up her hands against her mother descending with the knife			1
' six weeks later , at the nurses station , this little squeaky voice started yelling , " @entity130 , @entity130 " , ' mr @entity32 said			0
' we had no idea she as ever going to talk again			0
' for the next three months , i visited @entity16 and @entity147			0
i found that very hard , someone you 'd known and loved for years and was totally different			0
' i was called into a staff meeting and they explained schizophrenia and bipolar and whatever			0
' as a three - year - old , @entity0 began speaking with her father about the incident , saying ' @entity157 cut my neck ' and , with a psychiatrist 's encouragement , @entity32 increasingly talked with his daughter about what had happened			1
after a year in the mental hospital , @entity16 returned home			2
her husband was told she could make a full recovery			0
social services were involved in the family 's rehabilitation and @entity0 was not left unsupervised with her mother			1
' while i was growing up , i was n't allowed to talk about it , ' @entity0 said , ' i was too busy playing ... at home on my own			1
' between the ages of ten and 13 , @entity0 watched her mother slip into further psychotic episodes and gain the realisation that the attack ' could be her fault and maybe she owed me an apology '			1
when she was 13 years old , @entity0 's parents divorced and she began to open up about what had happened			1
' i began telling everyone what my mother did , ' she said			0
@entity185 even joked about it , saying , well at least she did n't roast you alive			0
' for a long time i felt i owed my mother something because she was sick and if i did n’t help her , that would make me a bad person , ' @entity0 told @entity192 of @entity193			1
' [ then ] i realised i had to look after myself , i kept repeating to myself , " there 's nothing i ca n't do "			0
' @entity0 had laser surgery to remove her tracheostomy			2
prior to that , her father would have to change the tube as often as every three days			0
the operation allowed her to go to school for the first time			0
@entity0 is now 27 years old			2
she has a faint scar across her neck and a catch in her voice , testimony to the hard won regaining of her speech , which she did using the top of her oesophagus to generate sounds			0
she became a writer , operating several blogs and @entity217 pages , advocating the right of people who live with those who have mental health issues			1
in 2005 , she met her husband , @entity222 , and they now have two young children			0
it is only now she has been able to speak out publicly about the attack which changed her life , and say that her mother 's decision not to take medication for her disorder was her own , not @entity0 's responsibility			1
. ' after 2007 , i stopped seeing her [ my mother ]			0
our paths cross , but it 's rare			0
basically all i wanted her to say sorry			0
' it was n't till i had my own children , i realised i had issues			0
' i have a knife phobia and hyper - vigilance , which is similar to paranoia			0
i 'm always looking around me for issues including knives or things close to my face			0
' one of the biggest realisations i 've had , is if you 've every suffered abuse or mistreatment at the hands of a parents , they do n't change necessarily ... but it 's the best choice for you [ to get on with your life ]			0
' i can raise my children as normal humans , something i never had in my life			0
