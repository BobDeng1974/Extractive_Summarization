@entity0 , archbishop of @entity1 , last night called for the introduction of state - run food banks after being ' shocked ' by the hungry in @entity5 the archbishop of @entity1 was warned not to become a ‘ political pawn ’ last night after calling for state - backed food banks			1
the most reverend @entity0 said he had been left more shocked by the plight of @entity5 ’s hunger - stricken poor than those suffering in @entity13 refugee camps			1
his comments came before the publication of a wide - ranging report , backed by the archbishop , that calls for the government to do more to eradicate hunger			2
but yesterday senior @entity20 criticised the clergyman for supporting the ‘ nationalisation ’ of food banks			1
in addition , the @entity25 ’ study found that families ’ lack of money was not the only problem			0
the all - party commons group on hunger warned that some parents spend far too much money on cigarettes , alcohol , takeaways and other ‘ non-essential items of expenditure ’ because they lack basic budgeting skills			1
many more can not cook even the simplest meals for their children – leaving them to go hungry			0
the mps call upon teachers to do more to report parents from chaotic households so they can receive help from ‘ troubled families ’ units			0
however , they conclude : ‘ we should not leave the duty resting with schools			0
parents have duties , and these duties are not abated by the chaos resulting from their lifestyle			0
’ the report , @entity5 , is released today			2
chaired by @entity60 mp @entity59 , the all - party group calls for : the archbishop wrote in the @entity63 how hunger ‘ stalks large parts ’ of the country			2
he added that he found the plight of a @entity69 family who resorted to using a food bank ‘ more shocking ’ than terrible suffering in @entity13 because it was so unexpected			1
last night former cabinet minister @entity73 said : ‘ he ’s fully entitled to make points about food banks			1
where they get it wrong is talking about the government having to do food banks			2
a report into hunger in @entity5 found that families ' lack of money was not the only barrier to buying food , and that many spent money on alcohol and cigarettes instead ( pictured , a woman works in a food bank ) ‘ my understanding of religion ... is it ’s about religious responsibility			1
' i do n’t remember any part of the gospel where people were told to queue up outside @entity103 ’s office and tell him to give more money to the poor			0
[ the archbishop ] should allow himself to be aware that he should n’t be used as a pawn in a political game			0
’ @entity110 business minister @entity109 stressed that food bank dependency had risen under the @entity112 in part due to greater awareness			1
‘ before we came to power , food banks were not allowed to advertise their existence , ’ he said			1
‘ one of the reasons for the increase in use is because more people know about them			0
’ @entity73 said the archbishop risked becoming a ' political pawn ' after he called for the state to intervene and run food banks @entity128 , the former immigration minister , said : ‘ we have a welfare state now , but what they ’re saying is the welfare state should take over food banks , should nationalise food banks			1
’ the all - party report also discloses the ‘ unpleasant truth ’ that some children are hungry when they get to school because of the ‘ chaotic conditions in their homes ’			2
‘ a large proportion of primary schools that submitted evidence to the inquiry said they had witnessed children arriving at school hungry because their parents could not , or would not , wake them up to make them breakfast , or bring them to the school breakfast club , ’ the report says			2
another factor behind parental poverty is the addictions that many families face			0
‘ budgeting support is terribly important , but ... is often not enough to equip families to kick their addictive habits when addiction is being fed and defended by some very powerful lobbies , ’ it warns			0
the report says some parents are so tempted by cheap alcohol in supermarkets , and the plethora of betting shops on high streets , that they spend money on these rather than food for their children			0
‘ a family earning £ 21,000 a year , for example , where both parents smoke 20 cigarettes a day will spend a quarter of their income on tobacco , ’ it adds			0
@entity185 leader @entity185 backed the report , saying he agreed with introducing ‘ yellow cards ’ for benefit claimants .			1
