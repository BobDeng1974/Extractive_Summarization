' the law has traditionally been generous in finding ways to fix errors in contracts			0
the @entity6 saw no reason why the same principles should not apply to wills			0
' @entity64 was very clear that he would go as far as the letter of the law would allow in making sure mr @entity41 ’ wishes were carried out			0
' he added : ' today ’s judgment is important because the concept of ‘ clerical error ’ has now been a given a wider meaning by the @entity6			0
' to date , it was thought only typing errors could be fixed			0
' this has now been extended to include mistakes arising from office work of a routine nature such as preparing , filing , sending , and organising the actual execution of a will			0
