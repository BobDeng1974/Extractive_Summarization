there was never any question over what @entity2 would call her daughter when she was born last month			1
it was always going to be @entity6 , the name of the specialist nurse who looked after her big brother @entity9 during his three - and - half year battle with leukaemia			1
' deciding on the name was easy , ' explains @entity2			1
' my husband @entity13 and i have never met anyone like @entity6 — it was a tiny gesture of thanks for everything she ’s done			1
' three months earlier , five - year - old @entity9 had finally finished his treatment and was declared cancer - free			1
heroic : nurse @entity22 ( right ) has been nominated for a @entity23 by @entity2 ( left ) but it was the empathy and the many extra hours @entity22 put in helping the anxious family along their journey that has earned her a nomination for the @entity29			1
' other nurses clock in and off , @entity6 is a constant			1
there ’s no one else like her , ' says @entity2 , a 34 - year - old accountant			1
the family , who live in @entity36 , in @entity37 , first met @entity6 in september 2009 , after a terrifying five days when @entity9 became suddenly and desperately ill. ' one day he was fine , playing with his twin sister @entity39 , then suddenly he stopped eating , was pale , exhausted and crying through the night for no apparent reason , ' recalls @entity2			1
' when angry purple bruises appeared all over his body we rushed him to hospital			2
'' just 12 hours after a barrage of tests at @entity50 doctors revealed the shocking diagnosis : the 19 - month - old had leukaemia			1
' you ca n’t imagine what being told your son has cancer feels like , ' says @entity2			1
' the world just stops			2
' as the hospital ’s paediatric oncology nurse , @entity6 , 56 , was there at the diagnosis			1
' for the next two hours @entity6 sat with us explaining everything in great depth , fielding our questions and laying everything out clearly and honestly			1
' i remember asking her whether @entity9 was going to die and she said : " his condition is fully treatable			1
" she could n’t say no , but she has a natural way of reassuring you			2
it was n’t until later that i realised her shift had actually finished at 5pm , six hours earlier			2
she ’d stayed to help us			2
' it was just the first of many such gestures that demonstrated @entity6 ’s extraordinary dedication to her young patients			1
' @entity6 would often call us at 9pm , hours after she should have left , with @entity9 ’s blood results			1
we ’d say : " what are you doing , go home , " but she ’d just laugh and say she had a list of patients she needed to call			2
' tragic : cancer takes a particularly grim toll on children who find chemotherapy extremely hard support : sick children , such as this little girl at @entity93 , need extra care from day one the @entity96 family had her mobile number			2
' children are n’t ill nine to five , monday to friday , ' explains @entity6			1
' i would hate to think something might happen and a family could n’t get hold of me			2
' @entity2 and @entity13 , a 37 - year - old aircraft engineer , frequently had to call @entity6 late at night when @entity9 developed croup — a fierce barking cough — because of his weak immune system			1
' i ’d be beside myself , worrying whether he needed to be rushed into hospital or not			0
knowing she was there , a phone call away , was a huge emotional support and stopped me flying into a blind panic			0
' once @entity9 accidentally pulled out his nasogastric tube — a tube inserted via the nose into the stomach to administer medication			1
unfortunately , it was on a weekend when @entity6 was n’t working , but she knew putting it back would be a traumatic experience for a child , so dropped everything and drove the 40 minutes from home to the hospital to do the procedure herself			1
' i just could n’t believe it			0
you do n’t expect a nurse to do things like that , especially on their weekend off , ' says @entity2			1
' we knew we had someone special in our corner			0
' in february 2010 , @entity9 developed an infection which meant he had to go to hospital twice a day for antibiotic treatment until it cleared			1
for a child so young , it was a horrible experience : ' i ’d lift him , asleep , from his cot and he ’d start crying pleading : ‘ no go , @entity142 , no go			0
’ it was heart breaking			0
' the next day @entity6 called to say not to take @entity9 to hospital as she was coming to their house with the equipment to teach @entity2 how to administer the intravenous antibiotics at home			1
' i could n’t believe anyone could be so kind			0
she arrived with a great crate of equipment and stayed until almost midnight , showing me exactly how it all worked ; the pump , the syringes , everything			0
' @entity9 ’s face lights up when he sees her and when he was in hospital if he heard her heels click - clacking down the corridor he would sit up in bed			1
' she ’d chase him around the ward on hands and knees , despite her dress and heels ( she does n’t ‘ do ’ trousers ) and treat him with such care and affection , explaining everything so he would n’t be scared			0
health hero : do you know any heroic healthcare workers who deserve an award ? make your nomination below ' @entity176 would always be put on the tv when she was taking blood samples and she ’d administer a bowl of @entity181 , another favourite , if he was n’t eating			0
' @entity183 said , @entity9 would do			1
@entity39 , as his twin , could have felt left out but @entity6 included her in everything , even letting her occasionally stay overnight in hospital with him as a sleepover			1
' for a parent , you ca n’t underestimate the impact of having someone like @entity6 around			1
i ’d have spent days stewing over @entity9 ’s health , endlessly worrying , but @entity6 being just a phone call away meant i was less anxious and felt more in control			1
she helped me and @entity13 to focus on the practicalities of his treatment and be better parents			0
' so what drives this kind of dedication ? ' it ’s the children , ' @entity6 explains			1
' they ’re a model to us all			0
they just get on with it , the good and the bad			0
if i can improve their lives , or their families , even a bit , i ’m happy			0
' i know in this job i can make a difference			0
i ’ve always loved children and got on with them easily and even as a little girl knew i wanted to be a nurse			2
' @entity6 , who is married to @entity218 , a solicitor , never had children of her own , a conscious decision because of her career			1
' @entity218 and i both work very hard			0
i ’ve trained and worked in healthcare , specialising in paediatrics since i was 19			2
i have a wonderful niece , two nephews and lots of children at the hospital to keep me busy			0
' @entity6 is adamant that she would n’t be able to provide such high standards of care without the help of her colleagues			2
' i could n’t be nearly so flexible without a strong team behind me			0
' one member of that team is @entity235 , a consultant paediatric oncologist who has worked with @entity6 for the last 18 years			2
she says : ' she ’s my right hand , a great friend with far too much energy and someone i trust implicitly			0
' but it ’s her knowledge and dedication to the children which is so impressive			0
she works out of hours , late into the night			0
she rarely takes a holiday , even though we try to make her			0
if she does , she writes 50 - page handover notes			0
she ’s a real inspiration			0
everyone on the ward looks up to her			0
' sentiments echoed by @entity2			2
' it will be a sad day when @entity6 retires and i feel sorry for the families who wo n’t get to meet her			2
we felt lucky every day that she was around and now we ’ll always be reminded of her kindness by @entity6			2
