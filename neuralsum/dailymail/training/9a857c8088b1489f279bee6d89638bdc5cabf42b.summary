@entity0 his trying to halt a @entity3 court challenge over alleged secret tracking of internet users who claim their privacy has been breached			1
the internet giant is challenging a decision by a high court judge in january that allowed @entity0 to be sued in the @entity3 for allegedly bypassing security settings to track the online browsing of @entity14 's @entity13 users and target them with personalised advertisements			1
the landmark case is being brought by a group of more than 100 people known as @entity19 against @entity0 ’s @entity20 , which includes editor and publisher @entity22 as well as it security company directors @entity23 and @entity25			1
campaigners : it security company director @entity25 ( left ) and editor and publisher @entity22 ( right ) are part of a group which claims @entity0 bypassed security settings to track their online browsing they say @entity0 ’s ' clandestine ' tracking and collation of internet usage between summer 2011 and spring 2012 has led to distress and embarrassment among @entity3 users			1
if they win , it potentially leaves @entity0 facing claims from millions of people who were using @entity14 devices in 2010			2
today , lawyers for @entity0 told the @entity46 that mr @entity47 in the @entity48 impermissibly failed to apply binding legal authority on two issues of law which were of general importance in the field of privacy and consequently erred in declaring that the court had jurisdiction			0
they also say that he got it wrong in several respects in his assessment of whether there were serious issues to be tried			0
' in the result , the judge wrongly dismissed the appellant 's application to set aside service of proceedings out of the jurisdiction , and his ruling should be reversed , ' @entity62 told the master of the @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74			0
challenge : @entity0 is challenging a decision by a high court judge that the @entity3 courts were the ' appropriate jurisdiction ' to try claims brought by the group , known as @entity19 against @entity0 ’s @entity20 @entity83 , for the group , said that the judge was right to hold that misuse of private information was a tort - a civil wrong - for the purposes of the rules governing service out of the jurisdiction and that the case raised important issues concerning the gathering of information by an international internet company			1
@entity0 says that dissatisfied users of the @entity98 internet browser should have launched their claims for misuse of private information in the @entity102 , where @entity0 is based			1
@entity103 , a partner at law firm @entity104 which is representing the claimants , said : ' @entity0 has already failed in the @entity48 to prevent the claimants from bringing this case in @entity108			0
' it felt that @entity110 was a better place for such a claim , a venue that would clearly be beyond the means of many @entity3 people			0
argument : @entity0 's lawyers told the @entity46 that mr @entity47 in the @entity48 failed to apply binding legal authority on two issues of law , and so erred in declaring the court had jurisdiction a group of @entity124 and @entity126 users are suing @entity0 , claiming the internet giant secretly tracking their browsing habits in order to bombard them with targeted adverts			1
the claimants , known as @entity19 against @entity0 's @entity20 , all used @entity14 's safari browser and have accused @entity0 of bypassing security settings in order to track their online browsing and target them with adverts			1
they say that cookies , small tracking files , were installed by @entity0 on the @entity14 computers and mobile devices of those using the @entity98 internet browser without their knowledge			2
cookies are used by advertisers , and owners of other websites , to target advertising based on an individual 's internet use			0
the campaigners also say that @entity0 's ' clandestine ' tracking and collation of internet usage between summer 2011 and spring 2012 has led to distress and embarrassment among @entity3 users			1
the claimants are accusing @entity0 of misuse of private information , breach of confidence and breaking data protection laws			2
the landmark case could pave the way for up to 10 million @entity3 to sue @entity0 for alleged privacy breaches			1
' this is why we argued , successfully , that the breach took place here and so the case should be brought here			0
@entity0 's now appealing against the decision			1
' it 's arguing that if people have not lost out financially from a privacy breach then they should not be allowed to sue			0
' we stand by the decision of the earlier court that declared , for the first time , that the breach of privacy is a tort thereby opening up @entity0 's transgressions to @entity108 courts			1
the regulator , it seems , agrees			0
it has asked to intervene in the case and supports our position			0
' the information commissioner , @entity190 , has intervened in the landmark case by making written submissions to the @entity46 , arguing that there is a ' serious issue ' to be tried			1
mr @entity190 has received permission by the court to make submissions on two specific elements of the claim - whether there is a serious issue to be tried as to whether the information at issue is ' personal data ' under the @entity205 ( @entity205 ) , and whether there is a serious issue to be tried as to whether the meaning of ' damages ' under section 13 @entity205 includes non-monetary loss			0
cause : ms @entity212 said the case had ' enormous relevance in that @entity3 people should have some means to hold @entity0 to account ' in his submissions , which have been handed into the court , he argued : ' there is a serious issue to be tried on the question of whether the @entity224 data amounts to ' personal data			1
' ' there is a serious issue to be tried on the question of whether ' damage ' in s.13 includes non-pecuniary damage			0
' mr @entity190 , said that the information gathered by @entity0 , regardless of whether they store people 's names , is ' personal data ' because it allows the company to target individuals with tailored advertising			2
he said : ' @entity238 ( @entity224 ) in the hands of the defendant is itself ' personal data ' for the purposes of the @entity205			0
' this is because it comprises both detailed information about websites accessed from a particular device , in other words a user 's browsing history and information derived from use of the @entity253 's @entity252 cookie			0
' he added this allows @entity0 to ' to recognise that the user of that device is present online ' and ' to target adverts at the user based on inferences about their interests derived from analysis of their browsing history			1
' he continued : ' there must be an effective remedy for breach of an individual 's data privacy , even where the breach merely gives rise to distress			0
' the claimants say that this case has ' enormous ' significance to the @entity3 public and if @entity0 are successful in its appeal they would be free to use people 's personal information for whatever commercial gain they chose			1
@entity282 mr @entity25 said : ' this is a crucial case for @entity3 internet users			2
it arose when @entity0 ignored the wishes of people using @entity14 's @entity98 web browser not to be tracked and tracking cookies were placed on their laptops			2
' we believe that if we choose not to be tracked online , @entity0 should respect our wishes			0
we feel it entirely wrong that @entity0 could track people online even when they did not seek to use @entity0 's services at all			1
' ms @entity212 , added : ' 170 people have asked to join this case			0
it clearly has enormous relevance in that @entity3 people should have some means to hold @entity0 to account			2
' unless we are successful , @entity0 will be free to use @entity3 ' personal information for whatever commercial purposes it chooses and no matter how that information was obtained			1
that would be dangerous for society and would render us second class citizens in comparison to those in the @entity102 , where @entity0 has paid a fine for the @entity98 security breach			1
' the hearing was adjourned until a date to be arranged in the new year for further argument on the remaining issues			0
after january 's ruling a @entity0 spokeswoman said : ' a case almost identical to this one was dismissed in its entirety three months ago in the @entity102			2
we still do n't think that this case meets the standards required in the @entity3 for it to go to trial			0
' but mr @entity103 said : ' the @entity46 hearing will decide whether @entity3 consumers actually have any right to hold @entity0 to account in this country			2
' this is the appropriate forum for this case - here in @entity108 where the consumers used the internet and where they have a right to privacy			0
