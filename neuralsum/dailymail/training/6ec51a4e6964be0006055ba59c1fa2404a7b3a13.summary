by @entity0 the @entity1 shows off her down - to - earth tastes – reading a rip - roaring bestseller and wearing a @entity5 swimming costume on holiday in @entity7 – even if she is relaxing on a £ 50 million yacht			1
she was spotted last week aboard the yacht ‘ @entity10 ’ , enjoying a @entity12 break with some friends			2
and the @entity14 had prepared for her trip with some high street shopping , judging by the royal - blue one - piece she was wearing			0
the simple costume with white straps , apparently from @entity5 , is from a previous season and cost about £ 20			0
relaxed : the @entity1 chats with a friend on holiday in @entity7 casting off : @entity23 devours her beach read it was one of three – including a pink polka - dot and a flowery blue number – that @entity23 wore during the day spent sunbathing and swimming with girl pals			1
the 246ft yacht is owned by car park tycoon sir @entity30			1
it can be chartered for up to £ 440,000 a week when sir @entity30 is not entertaining guests such as @entity34 and sir @entity35			1
in years gone by , @entity36 also visited			0
@entity23 ’s trip to the @entity38 was a perfect break for a woman who has long been known as a sun - lover			0
and no beach break would be complete without a book to read ( a paper book ; no kindles for the @entity46 ! )			2
@entity23 ’s choice was the appropriately titled @entity48 , by @entity49 , who was married to @entity50 and had a much - publicised affair with @entity52			1
steady how you go : @entity23 is known to be a fan of soaking up some rays head above water : @entity23 cools off in the balmy waters it is the fourth in the @entity59 , a series of novels following the lives of an upper - middle - class @entity64 family during and after the @entity66			0
the books , which are semi-autobiographical , have been called a ‘ guilty pleasure ’ but @entity23 displayed no signs of guilt , taking regular dips in the sea and chatting happily			0
perhaps her ease was in part because sir @entity30 , who was knighted in 1976 , has developed a close friendship with the @entity77 and has been discreetly lending them @entity10 since the @entity79 was decommissioned			1
he loaned the vessel to the @entity81 for her jubilee celebrations and @entity23 has stayed aboard at least three times			0
she and prince @entity84 used it for an official tour of the @entity87 in 2008 and she does n’t seem to have been deterred by the severe bout of seasickness she suffered then in choppy waters			2
this time the sea was calm when @entity23 , 66 , arrived in the @entity38 on monday for the mini-cruise with her protection officer and some lady pals			0
royal baths : @entity23 decides to do some floating as she unwinds off the @entity38 despite the glorious sunshine , however , a shadow was cast over @entity23 ’s holiday by the death of another figure from those days			2
at home , prince @entity84 is mourning his friend @entity102 , whom he met while at @entity103			1
the @entity84 was ‘ hit very hard ’ by the death of mr @entity102 , who was his confidant during the break - up of his marriage to princess @entity107			1
@entity102 ’s house , @entity110 , on the @entity108 , was where @entity84 and @entity23 discussed their future together			2
the royal couple will appear in public together on wednesday when @entity23 will join her husband hosting a reception in the gardens of @entity118 to mark 21 years of @entity119 to be sporting a suntan .			0
