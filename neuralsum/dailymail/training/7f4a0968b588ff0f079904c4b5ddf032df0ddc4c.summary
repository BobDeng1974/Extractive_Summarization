the magnetic field emitted by our @entity1 has been revealed for the first time in a stunning new image			1
taken by @entity8 ’s @entity7 satellite , it compiled from the first all - sky observations of ‘ polarised ’ light emitted by interstellar dust in the @entity12			1
the astronomical equivalent of looking through polarised sunglasses , it shows swirls , loops and arches that trace the structure of the magnetic field in our home galaxy , the @entity12			1
the @entity1 's magnetic field is revealed in a new image from @entity8 ; s @entity7 satellite			1
this image was compiled from the first all - sky observations of polarised light emitted by interstellar dust in the @entity12 , and was obtained using detectors on @entity7 that act like polarised sunglasses			1
@entity7 is @entity8 ’s time machine , looking back to the dawn of time close to the @entity31 , about 13.7 billion years ago			0
@entity7 will analyse , with the highest accuracy ever achieved , the remnants of the radiation that filled the @entity34 immediately after the @entity31 – observed today as the @entity36 ( @entity36 )			0
the results will help astronomers in deciding which theories on the birth and evolution of the @entity34 are correct , for example , did the @entity34 start its life with a rapid period of expansion ? light is a very familiar form of energy and yet some of its properties are all but hidden to everyday human experience			2
one of these – polarisation – carries a wealth of information about what happened along a light ray ’s path , and can be exploited by astronomers			0
light can be described as a series of waves of electric and magnetic fields that vibrate in directions that are at right angles to each other and to their direction of travel , according to @entity8			1
this can happen , for example , when light bounces off a reflective surface like a mirror or the sea			0
special filters can be used to absorb this polarised light , which is how polarised sunglasses eliminate glare			1
in space , the light emitted by stars , gas and dust can also be polarised in various ways			1
' by measuring the amount of polarisation in this light , astronomers can study the physical processes that caused the polarisation , ' the @entity8 says			0
' in particular , polarisation may reveal the existence and properties of magnetic fields in the medium light has travelled through			2
' the new map was obtained using detectors on @entity7 that acted as the astronomical equivalent of polarised sunglasses			0
in addition to its hundreds of billions of stars , our @entity1 is filled with a mixture of gas and dust , the raw material from which stars are born			0
the @entity8 's @entity7 satellite previously captured this microwave radiation image from the whole sky			0
in this image , the dust of the @entity12 is shown in blue , with a red band across the centre showing hot regions , while the mottled yellow area above and below represents relic radiation , otherwise known as the @entity36 , created in the fireball of the @entity31 13.7 billion years ago , which is the oldest light in the @entity34			1
even though the tiny dust grains are very cold , they do emit light but at very long wavelengths – from the infrared to the microwave domain			2
if the grains are not symmetrical , more of that light comes out vibrating parallel to the longest axis of the grain , making the light polarised			2
if the orientations of a whole cloud of dust grains were random , no net polarisation would be seen			0
however , cosmic dust grains are almost always spinning rapidly , tens of millions of times per second , due to collisions with photons and rapidly moving atoms			0
then , because interstellar clouds in the @entity12 are threaded by magnetic fields , the spinning dust grains become aligned preferentially with their long axis perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field			1
as a result , there is a net polarisation in the emitted light , which can then be measured .			2
