by @entity1 reporter published : 10:47 est , 23 july 2013 updated : 23:40 est , 23 july 2013 a businessman who raked in more than a £ 1m a year through a brothel disguised as a five - star licensed massage parlour was jailed for two years today			1
@entity6 , 32 , raked in £ 75,000 every friday night offering x-rated services at the brothel where his sister @entity9 was a receptionist			1
dozens of prostitutes earned up to £ 100,000 a year at the sex den in @entity13 , north @entity14 , which was posing as a legitimate health club			2
@entity6 got alcohol and massage licences from @entity19 for the @entity20 , and kept up to date with his taxes and national insurance contributions			2
@entity6 ( left ) was jailed for two years for running a brothel where his sister was a receptionist but in fact , he operated an 18 - hour - a - day brothel for seven years , offering as many as 27 prostitutes each night in private rooms with pole dancing and x-rated videos			1
@entity6 used the proceeds to pay off £ 8,000 - a - month credit card bills , and to fund his and his family ’s lavish lifestyle			2
when detectives raided the four - storey building , in @entity38 , @entity39 , in february last year , they found men and women having sex , 27 scantily - clad women , and £ 3,000 in cash in a jar on the bar			1
@entity6 , the owner and manager of the brothel , was convicted by a jury at @entity50 of running a brothel and money laundering			1
judge @entity53 jailed him for two years , but warned him he would have faced a longer sentence if the prostitutes had not been working in such good conditions			1
' @entity57 has been described as being as legitimate as it could be as a criminal enterprise ’ , he said			0
' it was in any view a remarkably successful one , and i think it 's right to say , mr @entity6 , that in light of all the evidence that success of that business is almost exclusively due to you			2
' i am in no position to try to calculate the profits , but they must have been very considerable , and supported an affluent lifestyle for yourself and members of your family			0
' this is a case of a long - standing , well organised , and profitable business which turned over a great deal of money			2
' the judge said many of the prostitutes interviewed by police had complemented @entity6 's style of running the brothel , running an expensive bar and legitimate sauna and steam rooms , and charging a 30 per cent credit card fee , but not taking any of the women 's earnings			1
the brothel was run at a five - star massage parlour called @entity20 and @entity95 in @entity13 , @entity14 ' you were not taking advantage of them in any way ’ , he said			0
' it has been urged upon me that i could possibly suspend the sentence , but the scale of the enterprise however renders that impossible			0
' but i will say the sentence i pass will be a good deal less than it would have been having regard to the financial success of the operation because of the conditions i ’ve referred to			0
' @entity112 , prosecuting , told the court the brothel had an ' absolutely staggering turnover ' , with @entity6 admitting himself the last ten months of business yielded £ 1.1m			1
the club 's website boasted ' international ladies ' , vip rooms and two penthouse suites , and billed itself as @entity14 's ' only five - star massage parlour '			0
@entity124 emails from @entity6 warned prostitutes to offer ' a complete service ' to customers , even if they were fat and ugly			1
' i suspect anyone looking at the website and the brochures , or read the emails could have had absolutely no doubt what the nature of the business truly was behind the scenes ' , said the judge			0
' the scale of the operation was truly remarkable , and on the occasion of the raid that were 25 or so women working			0
i have no doubt that was true on many evenings			0
' ' this is a case of a long - standing , well organised , and profitable business which turned over a great deal of money ' @entity6 , who took over the failing business from his uncle in 2005 , got valid licences from @entity19 and paid annual taxes , even registering several staff for income tax payments			2
he was joined in the dock today by his sister , @entity9 , 27 , a law graduate from the @entity157 , who worked as the brothel receptionist			1
the jury cleared her of managing the brothel after a four - week trial , but she was convicted of accepting £ 30,000 from her brother to pay off her student debts knowing it was the proceeds of crime			0
the judge told her : ‘ you are a very capable young woman when you put your energies to legitimate enterprises , this was an aberration which is unlikely to be repeated			0
’ @entity6 , from @entity173 , @entity174 , was convicted after trial of keeping a brothel and three counts of money laundering			1
he was jailed for two years for running the brothel , and sentenced to 18 months each for the other charges , to run concurrently			1
@entity181 , from @entity182 , @entity183 , was convicted of one count of money laundering and cleared of keeping a brothel			1
she was given a six month jail sentence suspended for a year , and put on a three month 9pm to 7am curfew			0
