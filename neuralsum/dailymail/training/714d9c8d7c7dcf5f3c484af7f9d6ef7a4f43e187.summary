by @entity0 @entity2 ’s government agonised over whether to demand @entity4 teams withdraw from the 1982 @entity5 amid fears they might have to play @entity7 - while @entity4 and @entity7 troops were still fighting in the @entity9			1
@entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 all qualified for the 1982 @entity5 finals held in @entity14 , with the opening game of the tournament scheduled for the middle of june			1
among the papers released by the @entity19 at @entity20 , west @entity21 , is a report by environment secretary @entity23 , written in may 1982 as the taskforce steamed towards the @entity9 , warning that @entity4 and @entity7 players could soon be facing each other on the football pitch			1
@entity28 : @entity2 's government agonised over whether to withdraw @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 from the 1982 @entity5 in case any of the teams met @entity7 , who @entity4 was fighting in the @entity32			1
@entity23 , right , wrote that a match with @entity7 would be a distasteful prospect her greatest triumph : @entity2 in @entity36 , beside a @entity32 painting ‘ in @entity4 , some footballers / administrators have already expressed concern at playing in a competition with @entity7			1
there is some feeling in our own party that this would be unacceptable , ’ he wrote			2
officials were also concerned at the heightened prospects of hooliganism at a time when it was still a big problem in the game			2
‘ whatever happens between now and the @entity58 series , the @entity9 factor can only increase the risk of hooliganism , and there is nothing we can do to lessen the risk , ’ warned @entity53 at the @entity54			2
pitching in : the final @entity10 22 who went to the @entity5 in @entity14 in 1982 tartan army : @entity11 also qualified for the 1982 @entity5 diplomatic problems : the fact that @entity12 qualified for the 1982 @entity5 , as well , further complicated matters for the @entity71 government @entity10 got off to a great start , topping their group after three victories over @entity75 ( 3 - 1 ) , @entity76 ( 2 - 0 ) and @entity77 ( 1 - 0 )			1
but their campaign faltered in a tough second round against @entity80 and @entity14 , flying home after drawing 0 - 0 against both of them			0
@entity12 also made a strong start , topping their group after beating @entity14 1 - 0 and drawing 0 - 0 and 1 - 1 with @entity86 and @entity87 respectively			0
@entity12 were eliminated in the second round after losing 1 - 4 to @entity75 and drawing 2 - 2 with @entity89			0
@entity11 were knocked out in the initial group stages			0
they got off to a flying start , beating @entity93 5 - 2 , but then lost 1 - 4 to @entity94 and drew 2 - 2 with the @entity95			0
but while mr @entity23 , as the cabinet minister responsible for sport , acknowledged that a match involving one of the home countries against @entity7 would be a distasteful prospect , he argued it would be wrong for the government to call for a boycott			1
withdrawal by the @entity4 teams would , he said , be greeted as a ‘ moral victory ’ by the @entity7 while damaging relations with @entity14 where there was strong support for the @entity7 cause			1
and then there was the cost			0
‘ the financial consequences of a withdrawal are considerable for the three @entity117 , ’ he wrote			0
‘ there could be a ban on competing in the 1986 @entity5 ; a heavy @entity122 fine ; the possibility of compensation ; the cancellation of travel and accommodation arrangements ; and players ’ contracts would have to be met			2
‘ the @entity129 and @entity130 could be bankrupted			0
whilst there might be no legal obligations on @entity133 for compensation , there could be a moral one			0
’ the government should , he concluded , stay their hand while they waited to see how events turned out on the battlefield			0
@entity142 hardened : @entity143 digging in at an @entity145 settlement during the @entity32 last - ditch effort : @entity10 's @entity147 heads the ball during the dying minutes of @entity10 's @entity150 match against @entity14 during the 1982 @entity5 so close : @entity147 is consoled by @entity151 after missing a chance to put @entity10 ahead against @entity14 in a match that ended 0 - 0 ‘ in the present international situation i believe that ministers can continue to argue strongly that @entity7 is the aggressor nation and that the onus of withdrawal lies in that direction and not with us , ’ he wrote			1
‘ my present view is that @entity133 should not yet suggest withdrawal to the football authorities , be that we should be ready to adopt that course , at short notice if the situation worsens and in the light of public opinion			0
’ in the event , the conflict ended and the @entity7 surrendered just as the tournament was starting			2
in the football , the three @entity4 sides and @entity7 were all eliminated without having to play each other .			1
