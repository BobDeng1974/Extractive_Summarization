by @entity0 published : 19:07 est , 20 november 2013 updated : 10:39 est , 21 november 2013 holding it all in : but are control pants good for mums - to - be ? the night before my third child was born sticks in my memory for all the right reasons			1
my husband and i had decided to get a babysitter and head out for a romantic dinner a deux , a last hurrah before the baby arrived			2
as he waited for me to get ready , i pulled on my comfiest pair of granny knickers and a stretchy , maternity bra			0
admiring my vast bump in the mirror , i then slipped into an empire - line dress which emphasised my full curves			0
happy with what i saw - and proud as punch of my bump - i headed out of the door , arm - in - arm with my husband , who told me , lovingly , that he thought i looked like a ship in full sail			0
i was n't remotely offended : he was right , and i felt wonderful			0
that night , in 2009 , it never occurred to me to worry about my wobbly bits			0
i never once considered whether i had a sleek silhouette or pert behind			0
i was in a blissful state , thrilled to be nurturing a new life , feeling free of all the usual constraints of fashion			0
now the cellulite police have turned their attention to pregnant women			2
where expectant mothers could once let it all hang out , they are increasingly expected to look svelte even in the latter stages of pregnancy			1
and how is this to be achieved ? with maternity shapewear , which lifts bottoms and smoothes out hips and thighs while supporting the lower back and tummy			2
pregnancy shapewear is fast becoming a maternity must - have - available in every shape and size for women who feel they need extra help from their underwear to smooth , enhance and reshape what lies beneath			1
since the most successful brand , @entity64 , was launched in the @entity65 in 2011 , sales have soared			1
@entity66 has their own lines of maternity shapewear , and @entity69 offers a budget version			2
and in online chatrooms and maternity blogs , pregnant women seem delighted that they can squeeze themselves into the human equivalent of a sausage skin			1
why is utterly beyond me			0
as someone who has carried three children , the most important thing when it comes to what to wear during pregnancy is good old - fashioned comfort			2
not so for a happy @entity85 customer , however , who wrote a glowing online review of the @entity87 , a £ 28 nylon and @entity90 body suit extending from below the breasts to the knees			0
she writes : ' they are easy to put on			0
i was worried that it 'd be a struggle			0
no tell - tale visible pant lines and no band at the bottom of the leg so you do n't get the mark under clothing where the shaper finishes			0
red carpet - endorsement : both tv presenter @entity104 ( left ) and @entity105 have extolled the virtues of control underwear ' i put them on and the effect was quite dramatic			1
i lost the saddlebag hips i seemed to gain during pregnancy and they smoothed my bottom into a rounder , perkier shape			2
you feel supported all round without feeling squashed			0
i wanted a smoother shape under a jersey maternity party dress - these do the job			0
' control underwear may be many women 's secret weapon , but should we really be expecting pregnant women to squeeze themselves into it simply for the sake of fashion ? @entity85 founder @entity128 insists she designed her maternity range to first and foremost provide comfort			1
' the fact they make your bottom and thighs look less jiggly and more toned is a side benefit , ' the @entity132 businesswoman argues			0
but the pregnant woman on the @entity85 packet looks far from comfortable			0
photographed wearing a nude pair of maternity control pants and towering stiletto heels , she looks rather like a pregnant pole dancer			2
she is also , disconcertingly , headless , since the picture is cropped just above the breasts			0
' control underwear may be many women 's secret weapon , but should we really be expecting pregnant women to squeeze themselves into it simply for the sake of fashion ? ' so how did this trend for maternity corsetry start ? as with so many other bonkers trends , it began on the red carpet			1
tv presenter @entity104 , 42 , credited @entity64 with allowing her to hide her pregnancy from photographers for six months			1
similarly , @entity105 , also 42 , extolled the virtues of control underwear , wearing it to firm up her behind when she was expecting her son , @entity165			1
in many ways , @entity104 and @entity105 may be typical of the maternity shapewear fan base - older women who need a little more help when it comes to sagging bottoms and dimpled thighs			1
however , i ca n't help but wonder if the fact that they were older when they conceived meant they felt uneasy with the appearance of a generous bump after so many years of being red - carpet ready			0
can maternity shapewear affect an unborn baby 's wellbeing ? ' babies are safely cocooned in the womb , ' says @entity188 - based consultant gynaecologist and obstetrician , dr @entity186			1
' it 's going to take a lot more than support hosiery to cause them even mild irritation			2
' however , the @entity194 takes a more cautious approach			0
@entity194 policy adviser @entity196 says : ' it is important not to restrict blood flow anywhere in the body during pregnancy , as the growing baby needs the oxygen that is supplied through the increased blood volume in expectant women			1
' any woman considering wearing tighter clothes for support is advised to talk to her midwife before investing in this kind of shapewear , ' she adds			2
the physical difficulty of removing constricting shapewear could cause other problems , according to @entity215 , a midwife and education adviser at the @entity217			2
she tells women to embrace their natural pregnancy shape instead of trying to constrict it			1
soaring sales : @entity64 is the most successful brand - but maternity shapewear could affect an unborn baby 's wellbeing ' anything that encourages pregnant women not to go to the toilet when they need to is likely to cause problems and increase the risk of urinary tract infection , ' she says			1
if a woman 's pregnancy reaches its third trimester in the summer months , she can expect to feel rather overheated in high - control underwear			1
there is also the troubling issue of muscle wastage : a garment that supports your stomach and bottom all day , every day , will take the load away from muscles and ligaments			0
@entity188 - based physiotherapist @entity246 , a spokeswoman for the @entity248 , explains : ' what i say to my patients is “ use it or lose it ”			0
' what we find is that women who wear maternity shapewear when they have no physical need can weaken muscles in their bottoms , stomachs and lower backs			1
' after the birth of their baby , they are more likely to be injured as they lift and care for their newborns ' she warns			2
it 's perplexing that so many women are relying on maternity shapewear when pregnancy fashion has never been better			1
for thanks to @entity277 trailblazers such as @entity278 and the @entity279 of @entity281 's favourite maternity clothing store @entity280 , it is perfectly possible for expectant mothers to look stylish in maternity wear			1
the trendy outfits make a feature of a bump without the need for shapewear			0
fashion stylist @entity289 , whose celebrity clients include singer @entity291 and top models @entity292 and @entity294 , says pregnant women should be confident in themselves whatever their shape - but there is one piece of maternity lingerie which she says is absolutely vital			1
' a good - fitting bra is important and needs to be resized regularly			0
i would recommend women are measured for their bras regularly over the course of their pregnancy and afterwards when they 're breastfeeding			1
' above all else , women should n't be made to feel insecure about how they look during the swingeing physical changes that come with pregnancy			1
and they certainly should n't feel some kind of imperative to be teetering around on heels in underwear that is hot , tight and uncomfortably restricting			0
i for one would be a lot happier if that @entity64 model kicked off her stilettos and shapewear and slipped into some roomy pjs and a comfy pair of slippers .			1

with celebrity endorsements , sales of pregnancy shapewear are soaring
control underwear is many women 's secret weapon
but should expectant mothers squeeze into it because it 's fashionable ?
and could @entity64 affect an unborn baby 's wellbeing ?
