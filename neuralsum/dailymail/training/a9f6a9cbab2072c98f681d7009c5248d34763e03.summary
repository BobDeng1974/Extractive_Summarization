the benefits of breastfeeding have been exaggerated , a new study has suggested			1
a comparison of siblings fed differently during infancy suggests breast milk is no better than bottled milk at improving long - term health			1
dr @entity9 , from @entity10 , said her findings are not meant to challenge established ideas , but could prevent women who can not breastfeed from feeling stigmatised			1
@entity27 leaflets given to pregnant women and new mothers claim breastfeeding protects against obesity , allergies , asthma and diabetes			0
but dr @entity36 ’s research suggests breastfed children perform no better than their siblings who are bottle - fed. it showed they are no more likely to be obese and that they do not perform better academically			1
dr @entity36 also claims that children who are breastfed are more likely to develop asthma than those who are bottle - fed. she said : ‘ many previous studies suffer from selection bias			1
they either do not or can not statistically control for factors such as race , age , family income , mother 's employment - things we know that can affect both breast - feeding and health outcomes			2
dr @entity9 says siblings who are bottle - fed perform just as well in the long - term as those who are breastfed ‘ mums with more resources - with higher levels of education and higher levels of income - and more flexibility in their daily schedules are more likely to breastfeed their children and do so for longer periods of time			1
’ the @entity27 recommends that mothers breastfeed for about six months			0
dr @entity36 said : ‘ i 'm not saying breastfeeding is not beneficial , especially for boosting nutrition and immunity in newborns			2
‘ but if we really want to improve maternal and child health , let 's also focus on things that can really do that in the long term - like subsidised day care , better maternity leave policies and more employment opportunities for low - income mothers that pay a living wage , for example			2
’ she used data from the 1979 cohort of the @entity93 , a nationally representative sample of young men and women			0
she analysed a total of 8,237 children made up of 7,319 siblings and 1,773 ‘ discordant ’ sibling pairs , where one was breastfed with the other given a bottle			1
the study measured @entity103 ( body mass index ) , obesity , asthma , hyperactivity , parental attachment and behaviour as well as scores predicting academic achievement in vocabulary , reading , maths , intelligence and scholastic competence			0
across all of the families , breastfeeding resulted in better outcomes in @entity103 , hyperactivity , maths , reading recognition , vocabulary word identification , digit recollection , scholastic competence and obesity			0
but when restricted to siblings differently fed within the same families , scores reflecting breastfeeding 's positive effects on 10 of the indicators were closer to zero and not statistically significant - meaning any differences could have occurred by chance			1
the researchers believe this means the siblings who were all breastfed probably performed better because of other factors , such as socioeconomic status			2
the most surprising finding was that children who were breastfed were at greater risk of asthma			0
however , this could be because the data relied on whether people said they had asthma , rather than whether they had been formally diagnosed with the condition			0
dr @entity36 also says children who are breastfed are more likely to develop asthma than those who are bottle - fed dr @entity36 said : ‘ instead of comparing across families we are comparing within families completely taking into account all of those characteristics - both measured and unmeasured - that differ by family such as parental education , household income and race / ethnicity			1
‘ if breastfeeding does n't have the impact we think it will have on long - term childhood outcomes then even though it 's very important in the short - term we really need to focus on other things			2
‘ we need to look at school quality , adequate housing and the type of employment parents have when their kids are growing up			0
‘ we need to take a much more careful look at what happens past that first year of life and understand breastfeeding might be very difficult , even untenable , for certain groups of women			0
‘ rather than placing the blame at their feet let 's be more realistic about what breastfeeding does and does n't do			0

dr @entity9 says the benefits of breastfeeding are exaggerated
she says comparisons of breastfed and bottle - fed siblings show the bottle - fed ones perform no worse than the breastfed ones in the long run
says studies that show benefits to breastfeeding do n't compare children from same family , so factors other than breastfeeding could be *responsible*
