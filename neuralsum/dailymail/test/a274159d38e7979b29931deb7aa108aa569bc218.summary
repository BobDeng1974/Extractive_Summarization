about 4.45 billion years ago , 150 million years after the solar system formed , @entity0 was hit by a @entity3 - size object called @entity4			1
the collision created the moon , but debate has raged exactly what happened during this event - and a mystery has persisted on why the moon and @entity0 are so similar in their composition			1
now , conflicting studies have provided two different theories - one that @entity4 was similar to @entity0 , and another that @entity0 and the moon were showered by debris following the collision			1
three studies have provided different theories for what happened after @entity0 was struck by a @entity3 - sized object called @entity4 , 4.45 billion years ago			1
what is agreed on , though , is that the impact actually happened ( artist 's illustration shown )			0
this is known as the giant impact hypothesis the two theories appear in the journal nature across three studies - two in favour of the ‘ similar to @entity0 ’ theory , and the other favouring the ‘ shower of debris ’ model			1
in the latter theory , a team of scientists at the @entity37 said the impact of @entity4 with @entity0 was so violent , the resulting debris cloud mixed thoroughly before settling down and forming the moon			1
many researchers believe the moon formed after @entity0 was hit by a planet the size of @entity3 billions of years ago			1
this is called the giant impact hypothesis			0
the hypothesis claims the moon is debris left over following an indirect collision between our planet and an astronomical body approximately 4.5 billion years ago			2
the colliding body is sometimes called @entity4 , after the mythical @entity56 who was the mother of @entity58 , the goddess of the @entity59			1
but one mystery has persisted , revealed by rocks the @entity63 astronauts brought back from the moon - why are the moon and @entity0 so similar in their composition ? several different theories have emerged over the years to explain the similar fingerprints of @entity0 and the moon			1
perhaps the impact created a huge cloud of debris that mixed thoroughly with the @entity0 and then later condensed to form the moon			2
or @entity4 could have , coincidentally , been isotopically similar to young @entity0			2
a third possibility is that the moon formed from @entity75 materials , rather than from @entity4 , although this would have been a very unusual type of impact			1
this cloud would have been composed of some @entity0 material , explaining the similarity between @entity0 and the moon , and other material			2
‘ this means that , right after the moon formed , it had exactly the same isotopic composition as @entity0 's mantle , ’ said dr @entity81 , a professor of geology at @entity37 and co-author of the study			1
both bodies have a similar isotopic ‘ fingerprint , ’ notably similar types of @entity94 , suggesting they had a similar origin			0
one difference , though , is that @entity0 has proportionally much less of a lighter isotope known as @entity97			0
the team said this is because after both bodies formed , @entity0 swept up more debris that had little @entity101			2
‘ we still need to work out the details , but it 's clear that our early solar system was a very violent place , ’ added dr @entity81			0
the team said their theory largely rules out the idea that the @entity3 - sized body @entity4 was of similar composition , or that the moon formed from only material contained in the pre-impact @entity0			1
the other studies , though , disagree			0
scientists at the @entity117 and the @entity118 in @entity119 said that @entity4 actually had a similar composition to @entity0			1
dr @entity121 and colleagues simulated collisions between protoplanets and compared the composition of each surviving planet with the composition of its last giant impactor			0
in one theory , a team of scientists at the @entity37 said that the impact of @entity4 with @entity0 was so violent , the resulting debris cloud mixed thoroughly before settling down and forming the moon			1
shown is an artist 's illustration of the young @entity0 and moon the @entity37 team examined the tungsten isotopic composition of two moon rocks collected by the @entity144 mission , including sample 68815 , seen here			1
when corrected for meteoritic additions to @entity0 and the moon after formation of the moon , the two bodies had identical @entity151 compositions supporting evidence includes the @entity0 's spin and @entity59 's orbit having similar orientations			2
moon samples indicating the surface of the moon was once molten also provide evidence , as does the moon 's relatively small iron core			0
the moon also has a lower density compared to @entity0 , while there is evidence of similar collisions in other star systems ( that result in debris disks )			2
giant collisions are also consistent with the leading theories of the formation of the solar system			0
and finally , the stable isotope ratios of lunar and terrestrial rock are identical , implying a common origin			0
they found that 20 to 40 per cent of impactors had similar compositions to the planets they impacted , whereas planets that formed in the same simulation tended to have distinct compositions			0
the authors suggest their results may explain the similarities between @entity0 and the moon - and why their compositions differ from those of other planets in the solar system			2
‘ we find that different planets formed in the same simulation have distinct compositions , but the compositions of giant impactors are statistically more similar to the planets they impact , ’ the researchers wrote			0
they said their theory has a 20 per cent probability of correct			0
whichever theory turns out to be correct though , both are in agreement that the formation of the moon remains a confusing mystery that is yet to be fully solved			0
‘ this is interesting stuff and no one has all the answers regarding the formation of the moon - we certainly do n't claim to , ’ dr @entity81 , one of the authors of the former study , told @entity211			0
however , the other theory says that @entity0 ( left ) and the moon ( right ) are so similar because the initial @entity3 - sized object , @entity4 , actually had a similar composition to @entity0			1
dr @entity121 and colleagues simulated collisions between protoplanets to make their finding			0

the moon formed when a @entity3 - sized body called @entity4 hit it early on
but no one is sure why the moon and @entity0 have a similar composition
@entity37 researchers say cloud of debris *rained* on worlds
but @entity117 says impactor was similar to @entity0
