by @entity0 published : 03:59 est , 23 september 2013 updated : 07:16 est , 23 september 2013 @entity1 today claimed she has been ' hunted ' over the murder of @entity5 student @entity3 as she defended her decision not to return to @entity7 to face retrial for the killing in her first live interview on @entity5 television			1
the 26 - year - old @entity12 said she was trying to rebuild her life after the ' ultimate nightmare ' of being wrongfully convicted and imprisoned over the killing of @entity17 student ms @entity16 in november 2007			1
ms @entity1 said she is now trying to fight back against her accusers because she was n't given the chance before and said she will take a lie detector test to prove her innocence			1
i 'm being hunted down , ' she told @entity27 ’s @entity26 , adding : ' i 'm trying to fight back now that i have the opportunity			1
' asked if she would be willing to take a lie detector test , ms @entity1 said : ' i would do anything to prove my innocence			1
i do n’t think that is necessary , but like i said , i am doing everything i can to prove my innocence			2
' i am not afraid of anything			0
i have been put through a tremendous gauntlet			0
' ms @entity1 has denied any involvement in the killing of ms @entity16 , who was found with her throat slashed in the bedroom of the house they shared in @entity45 , central @entity7			1
she was convicted along with her @entity7 former boyfriend @entity46 following a high - profile trial , but the pair were later cleared in 2011 after an appeal court found the prosecution lacking and criticised large swathes of the case against them			1
innocent : ms @entity1 today said she would take a lie detector test to prove her innocence over the murder starting again : ms @entity1 , who now lives in @entity58 , said she is trying to rebuild her life since being acquitted of the murder @entity7 ’s supreme court has ordered a new trial but miss @entity1 , who now lives in @entity58 , has said she will not attend			1
she said : ' i have plenty to fear because i was already imprisoned wrongfully , i was already convicted wrongfully and this is everything to fear , this , as an innocent person , is the ultimate nightmare , this does not make sense			0
' ms @entity1 added that she is unable to afford to travel to @entity7 and remain in the country for the duration of a retrial			1
mr @entity46 , 29 , has denied any involvement in the killing and has appealed for money to fund his new court battle			0
he is due to face a retrial next monday			2
explaining her reasons for not returning to @entity7 for the retrial , miss @entity1 said : ' there are many reasons why i have made the decision			1
loss : @entity5 student @entity3 was found killed in the apartment the girls shared in @entity45 ' one of the major reasons is because i have done this , i have given testimony ... i ca n’t financially afford to be going back and forth to @entity7			1
' i am in school , i am trying to rebuild my life			0
then there is the very real fact that i was imprisoned wrongfully and i can not reconcile that experience with the choice of going back			0
it does n’t make sense			0
' this is n’t a complicated case			2
it has been resolved and for people to hold on to circumstantial things that have been proven wrong ... at the very beginning , i never had a chance to defend myself			0
over the course of the trial , it was shown that i was n’t the monster that was being made of me			0
' she added : ' there is proof of my innocence in there being no trace of me in the room where my friend was murdered			2
' there was no reason for me to have done this , there is nothing that is a part of me that would ever do something like this			0
' it is so scary to have go to through this again , i did not expect this to happen			0
' and now i am not sure what to expect because i have two different experiences - i was wrongfully convicted and rightly acquitted for being innocent and now i have to hope that the next court is able to look at this without prejudice and realise that there is proof of my innocence here			1
' this is n’t a case about a character , this is n’t a case about a femme fatale , this is a case about my friend who was brutally murdered as she just happened to be home that night			2
' ms @entity1 said she would like ms @entity16 's family to take her to visit her grave and believes that they can help one another with the grieving			1
' the greatest closure is for them to be willing to take me to her grave			0
i never had a chance to see them before i was already called the murderer , ' she said			0
refusal : speaking on the today show , @entity1 said it was ' common sense ' that she will not return to @entity7 for the re-trial in the murder of her @entity5 roommate in 2007			1
@entity160 was freed in 2010 hitting back : @entity46 , who was accused of murdering @entity3 , says the police 's handling of his case was ' incompetent '			1
he claims he was blackmailed into framing @entity1 for the crime ms @entity1 said she understood why ms @entity16 's family might believe she was involved in her death but insisted the prosecution was wrong and asked them to consider her innocence			1
' i can understand where they 're coming from			0
i know that they think that i had some sort of involvement with @entity3 's death			2
' i would hope that they would eventually take into consideration even the possibility of my innocence			2
they need to understand that the prosecution is simply wrong and that their lawyers are wrong			0
' i also want them to understand that @entity3 really was my friend			2
she was very kind to me and i had nothing to do with her murder			0
and i am truly innocent			0
and i truly believe that the only way that any of us are going to be able to heal from all of this is if we come together and acknowledge the pain that we have all gone through			0
' ms @entity1 denied she had tried to cash in on ms @entity16 's death by writing her book , waiting to be @entity191 , which was published in the @entity12 earlier this year , and said all the proceeds had gone on paying back her parents and lawyers			1
' i am not sitting on a yacht somewhere - that 's not the case , ' she said			2
' odd behavior ' : @entity160 was pictured kissing her then - boyfriend @entity46 after the murder thanks : @entity160 acknowledges cheers of supporters while her mother comforts her after she was freed in 2010			1

ms @entity1 was acquitted of 2007 murder of her roommate @entity3
she had already served four years behind bars in @entity7 prison
a retrial of the case begins in 10 days , but @entity160 has vowed not to return
she appeared on @entity27 's @entity26 this *morning* in her only @entity5 interview
the 26 - year - old says she will take a lie detector test to prove her innocence
