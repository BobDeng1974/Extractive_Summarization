embattled @entity1 boss @entity0 today announced he will not take his bonus after late - running @entity4 track works caused chaos at the weekend			1
he had been on on track for a £ 135,000 boost on top of his £ 675,000 @entity1 salary , despite missing a series of performance targets			1
the decision to forgo the cash came less than 24 hours after he laughed at the idea that he would not take the money and was accused of trying to ' wriggle ' out of answering questions about it			1
@entity1 boss @entity0 today announced he would not take his £ 135,000 bonus mr @entity0 appeared at @entity20 today , after refusing to cut short his holiday in @entity22 to take charge to the fiasco			1
but he admitted driving to @entity25 from the @entity26 , instead of taking the train			0
during an excruciating radio interview yesterday , mr @entity0 refused five times to say whether he would take his bonus			1
in an apparent u-turn today , he revealed he would now not take the cash			1
he told @entity32 : ' i 've decided that i 'm accountable for the performance of the railway and in my view the performance over the @entity4 and @entity38 period was not acceptable and i 've decided that i should not take the bonus for this year			1
' i took this job on ten months ago knowing that the railway faced enormous challenges and i think i 've seen over the last few months that those challenges are very real – not just in terms of the reliability of the service , but in terms of the major engineering works that are required to keep the railways safe			1
' and that 's what i 'm really focused on and i 'm convinced that we 've got the plans and people now in the railway to deliver the improvements			1
' mr @entity0 had remained on holiday at this smart property in @entity22 instead of returning to @entity25 rail boss @entity0 last night returned to take charge of the railways - by car			1
the @entity1 chief executive had refused to cut short his break at his holiday home in @entity66 , @entity22 , where he is said to enjoy gardening , canoeing and sailing			1
today he insisted he had been in ' full contact ' by phone and email with staff , but admitted : ' i totally agree it would have been better if i had been there on the day , but i was n’t			1
' and he revealed that he did not let the train take the strain for his holiday , telling @entity32 : ' i drove back last night with three kids and two dogs ; it was an easier way to make it			0
' there was chaos at @entity85 on saturday when track maintenance works over-ran			2
passengers on the delayed services complained of sardine can conditions and of being forced to stand all the way to @entity92			2
there were extraordinary scenes at the station on sunday when men with flags were used to keep trains running after a signal failure			0
the continuing shambles , which has also engulfed the capital 's @entity102 and @entity103 stations , led to fresh calls from mps for heads to roll at @entity1			0
the infrastructure firm , which taxpayers fund with £ 5billion a year , was already under fire for announcing ' rip - off ' new year fare rises			2
yesterday there were also hold - ups due to signalling problems between @entity116 and @entity117 and between @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120 in south @entity25			2
emergency engineering works between @entity122 and @entity123 also meant disruption to a number of services in and out of @entity25 's @entity127			0
one of the major engineering projects over @entity4 involved the part - closure of the @entity130 between @entity132 station in @entity25 and @entity133 in @entity134			0
the line opened on time yesterday but by mid-morning passengers were enduring delays of up to 40 minutes due to a signalling problem at @entity140 in north west @entity25			2
passengers were left in tears in some cases with hundreds of journeys ruined by the overrunning works			0
the disruption caused chaos at @entity148 , @entity102 and at @entity103 where there was overcrowding yesterday mr @entity0 appeared on @entity151 down the line from @entity22 , from where he had refused to cut short his holiday to take charge of the chaos			1
he was accused by presenter @entity156 of trying to ' wriggle ' out of answering the question about whether he plans to take the pay - out , to the fury of thousands of festive passengers who faced misery on the railways at the weekend			0
in the excruciating encounter , mr @entity0 refused to speak for four - seconds , leaving the presenter to ask if he was still on the line , before he snapped back : ' i am still here and i 'm just waiting to talk about the railway			1
' @entity169 today called on the government to take responsibility for the crisis on the railways			2
@entity175 transport secretart @entity174 said : ' to be frank , in recent days ministers have done their utmost to shift the blame on to others			0
' but this happened on the government 's watch and it seems nothing was done to intervene when issues were brought to your attention in the weeks beforehand			0
it appears that ministers were asleep on the job , ' he said in a letter to transport secretary @entity193			0
' passengers deserve better than the terrible service they have suffered recently			0
as the crisis wore on last weekend and you were forced to finally issue a statement , you said lessons must be learnt and responsibility taken for mistakes			0
i hope you will agree that this should also apply to ministers			0
' @entity151 presenter @entity156 took @entity0 to task in an interview yesterday , when he refused five times to say whether he would take the bonus @entity156 : why do n't we clear up the question of whether or not you 'll take this bonus @entity0 : well @entity156 as you well know when i took this job on actually the bonus potential of this role was 160 per cent of my salary			1
one of the first things that i did in this job was to reduce this bonuses potential to only 20 per cent of the salary			0
@entity223 : which is £ 135,000 as i said			1
@entity225 : it 's a maximum of £ 135,000			1
the other thing that we have done is to make public what our performance is in every quarter so people can see how we are doing			2
as you probably know this year our performance has failed to live up to the expectations that the public would have had			2
@entity223 : catastrophically so in the judgement i suspect of those that went through the @entity4 chaos			0
so , easy question : will you or wo n't you take it , whatever it is at the end of the year ? @entity225 : first of all i want to apologise unreservedly to … @entity223 : that 's taken as read , will you or will you not take your bonus ? @entity225 : @entity249 , @entity156 , the bonus at the moment , the maximum bonus that i would be likely to get would be about 5 per cent of my salary … @entity223 : which is what ? @entity225 : … which will be a matter for the remuneration committee to consider at the appropriate time			2
@entity223 : forgive me , you earn £ 675,000 a year			2
if you are just talking about what 30 - something thousands pounds … why not just say i 'm not going to take it and get rid of that issue once and for all			0
@entity225 : i think by reducing the bonus from 160 per cent to 20 per cent we 've made some significant steps to hopefully diffuse the issue of bonuses			0
i think we have got far more important things to talk about			0
@entity223 : i can almost feel their collective temperature rising as they listen to you wriggle in the way that you are doing about the very basic question of whether you think you are worth this extra money in light of what they have been through … [ @entity279 ] @entity223 : are you still there ? @entity225 : i am still here and i 'm just waiting to talk about the railway			1
we really have had a very difficult time over the @entity4 period , the most intensive engineering safety and mamaintenance works programme ever in the history of the railway , over £ 200million worth of work that we have been trying to do , over 300 projects across the network			1
and unfortunately not all of these have gone according to plan and there has been enormous disruption for some of the passengers particularly those at @entity148 .			0

chief executive @entity0 was on track to receive a £ 135,000 bonus
asked five times yesterday by @entity151 if he planned to take the money
@entity0 fell silent and complained : ' i 'm just waiting to talk about the railway '
today he gave in to public pressure and announced he would forgo payout
