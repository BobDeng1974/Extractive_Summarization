by @entity1 reporter closing speech : jurors are almost ready to consider verdicts on veteran dj @entity5 , pictured @entity5 is the victim of a witch hunt by police who were desperate to find a scapegoat after missing @entity12 's crimes , a court has heard			1
the veteran @entity5 's defence barrister told a jury today that convicting @entity5 of 14 sex crimes would not ' right the wrongs ' of the @entity18 scandal			1
' police and the authorities missed @entity12 , ' said @entity21 in his closing speech at @entity23			1
' in any society when something goes wrong , a harvest fails , there is a reaction , an understandable reaction			0
' nobody wants sexual predators to get away with their crimes			0
' everybody wants them to be brought to justice but there is no justice whatsoever in overreaction , bringing a 68 - year - old man of impeccable character to this court and muddying his name to make us feel better about @entity12			2
' it would n't right that wrong			0
' @entity5 , a former presenter of the @entity46 's radio 1 breakfast show , is on trial under his birth name @entity5 accused of 13 indecent assaults and one sexual assault against a total of 11 women			1
the charges date back as far as 1976 when he was at the height of his fame and include periods when he was working as a @entity46 dj , as a broadcaster with @entity59 , while appearing on @entity60 and when starring in panto			0
accusing the authorities of a ' witch hunt ' , mr @entity21 said his client 's reputation was ' already finished ' despite no verdict yet being reached by the court			2
scapegoat : jurors heard today that @entity5 ( left with @entity12 in 1980 ) is the victim of a ' witch hunt ' by police who were desperate for scapegoats after missing @entity12 's sex crimes			1
both were high - profile @entity77 high - profile : @entity5 ( left ) and @entity12 were well - known @entity46 music presenters			0
@entity12 died before he could be brought to trial , and after his death hundreds of allegations of sexual abuse began to emerge he told the jury the ' person who started this ' - the first woman who went to police and said @entity5 assaulted her in the @entity88 studio - ' lied to you at length and in detail '			1
' it 's not unfair for me to say at this stage that that 's where the witch hunt begins , ' he added			0
' it began with a total lie			0
' he added : ' it 's so unfair to have an accusation made against you many years after the incident			0
' maintaining his innocence : @entity5 , 68 , arrives at @entity23 today the barrister said although the prosecution say that none of the alleged victims are motivated by money or fame , ' we just do n't know what people are going to do after this case has finished '			1
referring to the four assaults alleged to have taken place while @entity5 worked at @entity118 in the early 2000s , mr @entity21 said they had been ' blown out of all proportion '			2
of one woman , mr @entity21 said : ' mr @entity5 accepts he maybe touched her leg because he was close to her in an argument			2
' she went ballistic and went mad and people remember that happening and that 's what people remember , but not how she says			0
' nobody has given evidence of having received a complaint from her that he put his " hand up my skirt and in my knickers "			0
' he said the woman was known for particularly liking her personal space while he said of @entity5 : ' he is as has been described - a big cuddly bear who is very tactile			0
' earlier , prosecutor @entity140 presented her closing speech - in which she branded @entity5 a ' dirty old man '			1
she asked jurors to consider whether the @entity46 was a ' utopia ' when @entity5 worked there			2
she said : ' was the @entity46 a utopia where women were free from unwanted attention , where the djs behaved - apart from @entity150 ? ' where there were no rumours of untoward behaviour - apart from @entity150 ? where every complaint was dealt with properly ? ' ms @entity156 said the trial had heard from witnesses who said this was not the case and told the jury of eight women and four men to ' bring your scepticism ' to the case			2
' this utopia that was the @entity46 where no girls ever felt that they were being sexually harrassed or anything was untoward , ' she said			0
' i 'm sorry , ladies and gentlemen , but my expression to that is " oh please			0
" ' ms @entity156 told jurors not to focus on the ' morality ' of what was acceptable in the 1970s and 80s , because @entity5 has denied the assaults completely , rather than pinning them on a misogynistic industry			1
breakfast : @entity5 's beard and slot on @entity88 's prime slot led him to be nicknamed the @entity5 fame : @entity5 in 1980			1
the judge in his trial is expected to sum up the case tomorrow before the jury retires she added it was a ' criminal trial and not a feminist rant by me as to a culture that existed at a particular point of time that some of us lived through '			1
she also told jurors that although the courts regularly deal with more ' horrific cases ' , it was not their job to ' judge degrees of guilt '			1
referring to the most recent alleged assault , where it is claimed @entity5 grabbed a journalist 's breasts as if to check their size , ms @entity156 said it sounded like a @entity213 film , but this did not mean it was not serious			2
ms @entity156 told jurors to forget about @entity5 's fame and treat him as a ' normal member of the public , no more nor less '			1
' his celebrity might have given him protection in the past , ' she said			0
judge @entity222 is due to sum up the case tomorrow before the jury retires to consider its verdict			1
