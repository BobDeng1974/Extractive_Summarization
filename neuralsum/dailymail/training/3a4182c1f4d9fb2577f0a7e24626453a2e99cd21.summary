@entity3 's physique has long been coveted by women - and admired by men			0
but it seems the classic hourglass figure that the star epitomised could be on borrowed time @entity25 is famed for her curvy hourglass physique , but @entity16 women are getting further and further away from this ideal , with waist sizes increasing by 7in since the 1950s the hourglass figures of @entity32 characters @entity33 , left , @entity34 , centre , and @entity25 , right , are now largely a thing of the past in the @entity16 , with waist sizes ever increasing for a perfect hourglass figure , a woman ’s hip and bust must be of equal size , with a narrow tapered waist			1
but a study has found that this shape is becoming increasingly rare			0
in 1951 , the average woman ’s waist was 27 inches , with her bust and hips around ten inches larger			1
but researchers who surveyed 5,500 women found the average waist now measures 34 inches			2
hip and bust dimensions , meanwhile , have grown by only an inch , leaving them just four inches larger than the waist			0
as a result , almost half of @entity16 women are now classed as a ‘ rectangle ’ – with little difference between bust , waist and hip measurements			1
the data compiled for women 's sizes showed that while the average waist size has increased by more than 25 percent , women 's hips and busts have n't seen increases on the same scale			2
this has led to a change in women 's figures from svelte hourglass to a more rotund , stout shape			0
- and 38 per cent of women in @entity16 being classed as overweight			1
women in the @entity16 now weigh 7.5 lbs more than they did in 1951 - and even though they are 1.5in taller this still shows a general trend to higher @entity84 and greater levels of obesity nowadays			1
@entity87 had a figure typical of the 1950s , while @entity89 has a body typical of 2013 the changing shape of @entity16 women : as well as larger wasitlines they have grown by 1.5in and are an average of 7.5lb heavier than women in 1951 since @entity96 season six - a series based on the 1960s world of advertising - premiered on 7 april , one @entity100 clinic has reported a 40 per cent increased interest in body - sculpting waistline - reduction treatments from women wishing to emulate @entity25 ' shape			1
@entity106 , beauty director at @entity107 , said : ' our most popular treatment with our @entity111 system is the " @entity96 waistline " and since the show came back on to tv we 've been inundated with bookings			0
' the reason why it 's in such demand is because the waistline is one of the hardest areas to shift weight			0
' even with regular work - outs and a good diet this is often the last area that a women will lose fatty tissue			0
