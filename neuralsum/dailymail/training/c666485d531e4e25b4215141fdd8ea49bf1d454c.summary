by @entity0 published : 11:21 est , 29 august 2012 updated : 23:50 est , 29 august 2012 hearing : @entity1 , 37 , denied ignoring her cries for help and failing to notice she had been seriously injured a 97 - year - old woman was left crying out in agony after she broke her neck at a @entity9 care home and was given just two paracetamol tablets , a hearing was told			1
the pensioner was left in her bed for nearly two hours before an ambulance was called			1
@entity1 , 37 , denied ignoring her cries for help and failing to notice she had been seriously injured			1
the hearing also heard how he did not call an ambulance to avoid ‘ whingeing ’ paramedics			1
but giving evidence he told the @entity22 he did not call an ambulance because he could not be ‘ 100 per cent sure ’ what was wrong with her			1
after a ten minute assessment , he gave the woman two painkillers following the 6am fall and did not bother to check on her again before his shift ended at 7.30am , it was alleged			0
the woman fell in her room at the @entity9 - run @entity32 in @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , on march 20 last year			0
senior carer @entity37 took over from mr @entity1 at 7.30am , and an ambulance was called shortly afterwards when the woman 's condition was discovered			1
@entity41 , chairing the @entity22 hearing , said : ' mr @entity1 stated he did not want to call an ambulance if he was not 100 per cent certain as to the need , since the ambulance staff would be ‘ whingeing and upset ’ if they were called unnecessarily			1
‘ as a registered nurse and the senior member of staff on duty at the time , it was mr @entity1 ’s responsibility to call an ambulance			1
‘ he did not do so			0
‘ that omission is , in the panel ’s judgement , a culpable failure			0
’ @entity1 was today found guilty of five failures in the care of patient a before she was eventually taken to hospital			2
his evidence was criticised as inconsistent , at times contradicting his notes made at the time of the incident and some of his own testimony to the hearing			2
‘ according to mr @entity1 , patient a was mobilising her arms and legs but could not say whether she was in pain ’ , said ms @entity41			2
‘ he recorded that patient a was complaining of ‘ pain in neck ’			0
‘ this directly contradicts his oral evidence that she was not able to say whether she was in pain			0
’ care assistant @entity82 had told the panel resident @entity84 was ‘ screaming in pain ’ and holding her neck , but mr @entity1 had dismissed her concerns saying : ‘ she does n’t need to go , there ’s nothing broken			1
’ ‘ she had n’t any injuries , no bleeding or swelling , and she was just sat on the commode not saying anything to me ’ , mr @entity1 said			2
‘ i could n’t be sure if she was ok or not , but she was saying she wanted to get up and go to bed			0
at the time i saw her she was not crying and i did not see her in pain			0
‘ if there was any pain , there is no problem to send to hospital , but at the time i saw her she was not crying			0
’ @entity1 gave patient a two paracetamol tablets , but was found guilty of failing to document this properly			2
he was further found guilty of failing to complete paperwork following the fall , and claimed he had asked care assistants to do it for him			0
‘ mr @entity1 had an independent duty , in accordance with his responsibility as a registered nurse , to record assessments made , treatments administered and medicines given and could not delegate those responsibilities to a third party			2
’ the panel also decided @entity1 had failed to give an adequate handover at the end of his shift , further delaying the calling of an ambulance for patient a. @entity1 must now argue his fitness to practice as a nurse is not currently impaired as a result of this incident			1
if the panel decide it is , he could face being struck off the nursing register .			0

hearing was told @entity1 did not call an ambulance to avoid ' whingeing paramedics '
the pensioner was left in her bed for nearly two hours
but he said he did **n't** dial *999* as he could **n't** be ' 100 per cent ' sure what was wrong with her
