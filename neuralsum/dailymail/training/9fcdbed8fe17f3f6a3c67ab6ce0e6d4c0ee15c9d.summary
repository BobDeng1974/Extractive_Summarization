by @entity0 for @entity1 it 's a staple dairy substitute and increasingly said to be a ' superfood ' able to cure an array of ailments from heart disease to @entity7			1
and as well as coconut water , milk , yoghurt , sugar , flesh and oil , new coconut - based food and beauty products are popping up every day in supermarkets and health food shops			1
hoping to deliver simplified , science - based analysis , weight and health management website @entity23 have enlisted their expert to cautiously debunk or back up claims about this tropical ingredient			1
here , registered dietician @entity28 explains the pros and cons of including various coconut products in your shopping basket			1
it has less sugar than fruit juices and more minerals such as potassium , sodium , magnesium and calcium			1
these properties are great as a post-workout drink if you 've only been doing moderate exercise , but there is n't enough protein or carbohydrate if you 're undergoing vigorous exercise of over 1 hour			1
ultimately , coconut water contains calories - do you need these ? if you 're drinking purely for hydration , water is always the better choice			1
you can get the minerals from a well - balanced diet so i would n't drink this religiously , but if you enjoy it , have one occasionally			1
rebel @entity67 green tea mylk , £ 1.89 , one of the newest coconut - milk based health drinks this is becoming more and more popular and can be bought from supermarkets now			1
it can be used for roasting and baking			1
it has a similar nutritional profile to butter in that it has a high saturated fat content which is currently being discovered to be less harmful to health than initially thought , particularly the type of saturated fats which are found in coconut oil : lauric acid and @entity88 acid			2
coconut oil also contains some poly and mono - unsaturated fats which bring additional health benefits			2
it is still an energy - dense food so should be used in moderation			2
this can be used instead of sugar in baking			2
it has a lower gi than standard granulated sugar , however a similar kcal content per gram			2
it may be a healthier alternative to traditional granulated sugar , however it is still an energy - dense food - type which should only be used on special occasions			2
this is a fairly new dairy - free alternative , great for those who are lactose - intolerant and who fancy a change from the soya varieties ! it is much higher in fat than both natural dairy yoghurt and soya yoghurts , but also much lower in carbohydrates ; research is now beginning to find that a diet higher in fat than carbohydrate can aid weight loss efforts			1
steer clear of the flavoured varieties , as with all yoghurt types in fact , as they 're packed with lots of sugar			0
a 150g serving can provide you with a good , filling 200kcal snack which should keep you feeling full due to the high fat percentage			0
@entity132 in north @entity133 are pioneering the oil and butter - packed coffee trend , controversially said to help with weight management and raise @entity137			0
a serving costs £ 3.50 , and contains two to six tablespoons of @entity140 unsalted grass - fed butter , two tablespoons of @entity142 coconut oil , and two cups of hot coffee brewed with low - toxin beans , all blended until they are frothy like a foamy latte			0
just one cup can contain 50g of fat , ( more than 40g of that saturated ) and 450 calories			0
it 's full of brain power - boosting vitamin @entity154 - dense butter and metabolism - boosting oil - but lacks other essential nutrients			0
coconut oil contains poly and mono - unsaturated fats which bring health benefits fresh coconut flesh is delicious and full of vitamins and minerals			0
plus it goes well in smoothies fresh coconut flesh is delicious , full of vitamins and minerals and goes really well in a smoothie			0
@entity170 as a snack but go easy on your portion sizes - a typical snack pack ( 100g ) of fresh coconut pieces contains 271kcal compared to just 50kcal in a 100g fresh fruit pot. just a few pieces should be enough to get you through to the next meal			0
there are two types of coconut milk widely available - one is about 8 per cent coconut cream mixed with water , sugar and preservatives , the other is mixed with rice milk without the need for sugar and requires less preservatives			0
both have a similar kcal content to soya milk ( about 1/2 that of semi-skimmed milk ) but a much lower protein content than both soya and semi-skimmed milk			0
i would suggest going for the no added sugar option ; ensure that if opting for coconut milk you choose one with added calcium and vitamin d which can not be naturally found in this product .			0
