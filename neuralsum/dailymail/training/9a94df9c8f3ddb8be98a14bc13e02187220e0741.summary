by @entity0 follow @ @ oliver_todd @entity1 still hopes he can convince @entity4 flop @entity2 to join @entity5 - and says new @entity7 boss @entity6 has ' nothing to do ' with his move for the midfielder			1
former @entity11 and @entity12 manager @entity1 was in a bullish mood after his side 's 1 - 0 friendly win over @entity16 and was convinced that @entity2 's decision will hinge on his view of the ' project ' in @entity20			1
the @entity22 's comments seemed to hint that @entity5 would wait for the @entity24 midfielder to hand in a transfer request at @entity27 rather than wait for @entity28 to approve the loan move			1
' it did n’t depend on the coach , but on the project			0
that will be the case with @entity2 too : @entity28 has nothing to do with it , ' @entity1 said			2
the @entity4 boss is expected to make a decision soon over which players to cut from his bloated squad ahead of his first season in the @entity51 - and £ 27million flop @entity2 is prime for the chop			1
when asked if the @entity24 was close to a move @entity1 said to @entity55 : ' is he ? i do n't see him			0
' our squad is strong , but clearly we are still missing something			0
we must continue to form a strong group to recover the lost ground from @entity62 and @entity63			0
' ability : @entity1 wants @entity2 's ability from his @entity51 experience to boost his squad @entity68 wants reinforcements			2

former @entity11 and @entity12 boss is hoping to sign the @entity4 flop
@entity1 hopes his @entity5 ' project ' will *attract* the £ 27million midfielder
@entity28 is expected to decide on player 's *future* after @entity80 tour
but @entity5 boss says ' @entity28 has nothing to do with it '
@entity1 was *speaking* after 1 - 0 friendly win over @entity16
