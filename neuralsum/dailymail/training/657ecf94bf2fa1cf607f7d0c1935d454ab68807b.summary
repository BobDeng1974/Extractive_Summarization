by @entity0 @entity1 , the former secretary of health , was reportedly furious that the report on substandard care at @entity6 and @entity7 hospital in @entity8 came out @entity9 tried to block the publication of a devastating report into appalling hospital neglect before the last election			1
ministers told the @entity15 not to release its verdict on @entity6 and @entity7 hospital in @entity8 , where patients were dying from poor care			1
inspectors found blood on curtains and chairs and catheters left on the floor at the flagship foundation hospital			2
death rates in @entity28 were a third above average			1
but hours before the @entity15 was due to publish the report in november 2009 , the @entity30 told the watchdog to stop			1
newly - released emails show that the then health secretary @entity1 was furious when the report was later made public amid massive media coverage			1
they also show officials were asked to ‘ spin ’ a major @entity40 report , again in the run - up to the 2010 election			1
the revelation puts further pressure on mr @entity1 , who is widely tipped to lose his job as @entity9 health spokesman in an imminent reshuffle			1
he has been accused of failing to act over a number of failing hospitals – most notably @entity50 , where hundreds died of neglect			0
the emails were obtained from the @entity15 by @entity55 mp @entity54 under freedom of information rules			0
the commission was due to publish its ‘ state of care report ’ into hospitals and care homes in february 2010 , three months before the election			2
yet an email sent round by a senior @entity15 boss following a meeting with one of mr @entity1 ’s junior ministers instructs them that , ‘ given the political environment ’ , the report should be ‘ largely positive ’			1
the memo , sent in january 2010 , urges staff to ‘ be careful about language ’ and ensure it is ‘ hard - hitting without presenting critical data ’			0
inspectors found blood on curtains and chairs and catheters left on the floor at @entity6 and @entity81 the message from @entity83 , the @entity15 ’s director of clinical quality , to @entity84 , the deputy chief executive and @entity86 , the chief executive , concludes : ‘ it is really important that we get the tone absolutely right			0
’ another email – from @entity91 to @entity86 – refers to ‘ anxieties ’ about the publication of the report into @entity6 hospital			1
it says ‘ the secretary of state was furious ’ when the report – despite the block on it – was spotted on a government website by journalists			1
mr @entity54 , mp for @entity104 and member of the commons public accounts committee , said : ‘ mr @entity1 ’s position is now untenable			2
the longer he stays in post the more discredited his party ’s position is on the @entity40			0
mr @entity1 is widely tipped to lose his job as @entity9 health spokesman in an imminent reshuffle mr @entity114 has been accused of failing to act over a number of failing hospitals ¿ most notably @entity50 , where hundreds died of neglect ‘ he is furious when bad news comes out and his officials are saying whatever you do do n’t put anything bad in the press			1
his reputation is seriously damaged			0
’ @entity125 , who set up the campaign group cure the @entity40 after her mother @entity127 died at @entity50 , said : ‘ the whole culture within @entity9 was to keep problems hidden			0
that ’s why we lost so many lives			0
unless we address this culture we ’ll just lose more people			0
’ @entity55 health secretary @entity135 said : ‘ the care of @entity40 patients is too important for political meddling			1
’ earlier this week he announced the @entity15 would become entirely independent of the @entity30 in the hope that it will be more critical of how the @entity40 is run			2
@entity55 health secretary @entity135 said : ' the care of @entity40 patients is too important for political meddling ' eleven hospital trusts were put into special measures after a major investigation by the @entity40 ’s medical director professor sir @entity145 uncovered ‘ deep - rooted ’ failings			1
experts estimated that thousands of patients had needlessly died at these trusts over the past decade			0
professor sir @entity149 , a world expert on hospital mortality , sent mr @entity1 a list of trusts where the death rates had been very high for several years but it was ignored			1
sir @entity149 said health ministers had presided over a ‘ denial machine ’ designed to prevent criticism of the @entity40			2
but a @entity9 spokesman said : ‘ this is the latest stage of an on - going @entity55 smear campaign against the last @entity9 government			0
these old , unfounded allegations have already been answered in full			0
‘ no evidence has ever been produced to suggest anything other than that ministers acted properly at all times			0

@entity180 was also taken to improve the internal running of the @entity15			0
‘ on @entity6 , a @entity15 press officer briefed the media without authorisation and before the @entity30 was officially notified			2
this was a breach of established practice and left the @entity30 unable to respond properly to the many enquiries it was receiving , from public and press , following reports on rolling news programmes			2
’ miss @entity84 , along with @entity194 , was accused of conspiring to cover up a separate report into poor care at a maternity unit – both deny the allegations			2
