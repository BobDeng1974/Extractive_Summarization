by @entity0 last updated at 1:58 am on 23rd february 2012 the @entity1 is paying @entity2 to look after 2.5million ‘ ghost ’ patients , ministers admitted last night			0
doctors are receiving an estimated £ 162million a year – footed by the taxpayer – for non-existent patients on their books who have moved house , left the country or been dead for up to 40 years			1
the @entity13 has counted that in a single year at least 95,000 such ‘ ghost ’ patients were registered with gps and earning them annual payments			2
but the @entity18 last night admitted there are probably up to 2.5million such patients on doctors ’ lists in @entity22			1
empty : the @entity1 are paying doctors millions each year to look after ' ghost ' patients who are on their surgeries ' books but who have moved house , left the country or died every year gp surgeries are paid an average of £ 65 for each patient they have on their books , regardless of how often – or whether – they make an appointment or what treatments they receive			1
although there are currently 55million patients registered with @entity2 , there are only 52.5million actually living in @entity22			1
it means the @entity1 is potentially wasting £ 162.5million every year on ghost patients			0
outraged : @entity42 of the @entity43 wants to know why taxpayers ' money was wasted in this way @entity42 , chief executive of the @entity43 , said it was ‘ outrageous ’ that money was being wasted to treat patients ‘ that only exist within @entity1 bureaucracy ’			0
surgeries are meant to keep their lists up to date and take patients off when they die or move away , but this is frequently overlooked			1
in some cases doctors have been found to be deliberately keeping patients on their books to earn themselves extra cash			0
last year the @entity59 revealed that four doctors at a surgery in @entity62 , south @entity63 , were being investigated over a scam in which they were claimed to have 3,000 patients on their books who did not exist or had false information on their records that brought in extra @entity1 cash			0
of the latest findings , mrs @entity42 added : ‘ at a time when the @entity1 is being asked to make huge efficiency savings the government needs to provide answers as to how money was wasted in this way			0
’ in its extensive investigation the @entity13 , the government ’s spending watchdog , compared surgery lists to check patients were not registered with more than one gp if they had moved house			1
the officials also compared these lists with @entity72 records of deaths and data on failed asylum seekers who have since been deported			1
when officials came across patients registered with two surgeries , or those recorded as being dead or deported , they contacted the local @entity1 body which asked practices to check that their lists were up to date			1
health minister @entity96 , left , said that the @entity1 needed to make the best use of funds available while @entity99 said it was disappointing some areas had not followed up information provided by the investigation the investigation , called the @entity103 ( @entity104 ) , covered 2009 to 2010			0
it found there were up to 32,668 dead patients on lists – including 157 who had died more than 30 years ago			1
officials even came across one surgery which was being paid every year to treat a patient who had died in 1969			0
a further 29,416 patients had moved house and were registered with a different gp , but both their old and new surgeries were being paid for treating them			2
another 20,000 patients were removed from the lists when officials found they were not living at the address shown on the books			2
the officials also discovered 10,000 failed asylum seekers were on @entity2 ’ books even though they had since been returned to their home country			1
not all surgeries flagged up by the @entity13 for having high numbers of ghost patients bothered to check their lists			2
health minister @entity96 said : ‘ the @entity1 needs to make the best use of the funds it has available and avoid giving gps extra income for patients who have moved away or died			0
identifying ‘ ghost patients ’ will ensure that practices are fairly funded only for the patients they are responsible for			0
’ @entity99 , managing director of health at the @entity13 , said : ‘ the @entity1 and gps generally manage patient lists well – at any one time there are some 58million records and many movements on and off lists			1
‘ it is disappointing that some areas did not rigorously follow up the information provided by @entity104			0
’ @entity148 , deputy chief executive of the @entity149 , which represents @entity1 staff , said : ‘ it is important to make sure that lists of registered patients are up to date and accurate			2
‘ being able to plan and offer the most appropriate care for local people depends on accurate information			0
