with their flat caps and jackets , the crooks in these old mugshots might remind you of the @entity5 , the lovable rogue from @entity7			1
but the @entity9 boys and men , pictured in photos from a police archive , did much worse than pick a pocket or two			2
@entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 , pictured , were members of the notorious ' @entity20 ' gang which terrorised @entity21 around the turn of the 20th century - and now their exploits will be shown in a new @entity25 drama			1
the gang earned its chilling nickname through the practice of sewing razor blades into the peaks of their flat caps , so that they could blind rival gangsters by headbutting them			1
they ruled the industrialised areas of @entity47 and @entity48 from the 1880s through to the early 1900s , when the city was one of the world 's most important manufacturing hubs			2
but their gritty story will receive a @entity57 sparkle with the broadcast of the new series - simply named @entity20 - which will feature @entity60 and @entity62 star @entity61 in the leading role			1
the records of the gang members were part of a roll of old charge sheets from the @entity69 to coincide with the release of the series , @entity31 dug up the original charge sheets for some of the gang members , which are now more than 100 years old			2
the fading sheets show that , despite the reputation of the gang for terrible crimes , these men and boys had been hauled up on relatively trivial offences			2
@entity14 and @entity15 , aged just 19 in the photographs , were charged with ' bike theft ' after stealing the unattended item and attempting to sell it on			2
@entity16 , 25 when pictured , was charged with breaking into a drapers shop which was just 11 doors from his own home			2
gang members could start out as young as 13 , like @entity91 , left , and often had run - ins with @entity21 's police the @entity20 ran their crime ring in the backstreets of @entity21 ( pictured ) @entity17 , much older than the others at 38 , was arrested for the crime of ' false pretences '			1
all four gangsters are shown wearing the traditional @entity101 outfit , of donkey jackets , silk scarfs , bell - bottom trousers , steel - capped boots and a distinctive flat cap			1
court reports from the time refer to the gang members as " foul mouthed young men who stalk the streets in drunken groups , insulting and mugging passers - by			2
" @entity69 worker @entity113 , 69 , who works at the @entity69 , explained the method behind the gangsters ' signature weapon			1
the city was a vital centre of industry during the period the @entity20 were active a collection of young gang members are pictured in @entity21 's @entity122 the @entity124 area of @entity21 , pictured , was plagued by crime he said : ' it was quite a strange weapon they used to rob people , although makes sense when you think about it			1
' when they would hit someone on the nose with their cap , it would bring tears to their victim 's eyes and cause temporary blindness - that 's when they 'd thump you and rob you			1
' it is a very quick manoeuvre - that is how they worked			2
they would target anybody who looked vulnerable , the gentleman on his way to work who did n't look strong or fit , ladies , teenage girls , anyone - they would take anything they could convert into money			2

it also notes that he was given one month in prison for the offence			0
@entity15 , right , is listed as a co-prisoner - taken in for the same crime of stealing a bicycle , which was left unattended outside a factory for just four minutes when the larcenous pair laid their hands on it			1
they were spotted almost immediately afterwards trying to make easy money selling it on the street			0
the sheets show that @entity15 , born in 1885 , was also 19			0

his year of birth , listed 1866 , makes him 38 - significantly older than the other @entity20 listed on the record			1
the bald man is listed as having brown eyes and also brown hair - presumably deduced from his full moustache			0
the record says @entity17 , who said he was a fishmonger , had missing fingers and a distinctive mark on his right knee			0
he was charged on 18 october 1904 , and his crime is listed as ' false pretences ' - perhaps suggesting that he not involved with the more physical crimes like younger gang members			2
but theft and muggings was by no means the only illegal activity of the @entity20 , who built a criminal empire on illegal betting , protection rackets and @entity21 's black market			1
the were known to fight with rival gangs , and at times would even turn on the police			0
