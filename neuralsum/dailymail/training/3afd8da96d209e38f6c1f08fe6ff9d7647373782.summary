by @entity0 neanderthals are thought to have been brutish and ruthless creatures , stopping at nothing to survive their harsh environment			0
but , it turns out , we may have underestimated our distant cousins			0
new research reveals @entity9 made good parents and their children were well - cared for as part of the social group			1
happy families : archaeologists at the @entity16 have challenged the traditional view that @entity9 childhood was difficult , short and dangerous this is according to @entity21 researchers who have challenged the traditional view that @entity9 childhood was difficult , short and dangerous			2
cavemen children ‘ experienced strong emotional attachments with their immediate social group ’ according to the study			2
researchers at @entity16 also said there was evidence that @entity9 cared for their sick and injured children for months and often years			1
the traditional view of cavemen children is that they had a tough upbringing , but that is based largely on biological evidence			2
however the archaeologists , led by dr @entity35 , looked at cultural and social evidence by examining @entity9 burials			1
in research published in the @entity41 , it found that children played a particularly significant role in their society , particularly in symbolic expression			1
neanderthal groups ( skull , pictured ) are believed to have been small and relatively isolated , which meant a natural emotional focus on close internal relationships the study of child burials , meanwhile , revealed that the young may have been given particular attention when they died , with generally more elaborate graves than older individuals			1
neanderthal groups are believed to have been small and relatively isolated , which meant a natural emotional focus on close internal relationships			1
dr @entity58 said : ‘ the traditional view sees @entity9 childhood as unusually harsh , difficult and dangerous			2
‘ this accords with preconceptions about @entity9 inferiority and an inability to protect children epitomising @entity9 decline			1
‘ our research found that a close attachment and particular attention to children is a more plausible interpretation of the archaeological evidence , explaining an unusual focus on infants and children in burial , and setting @entity9 symbolism within a context which is likely to have included children			1
‘ interpretations of high activity levels and frequent periods of scarcity form part of the basis for this perceived harsh upbringing			0
‘ however , such challenges in childhood may not be distinctive from the normal experience of early palaeolithic human children , or contemporary hunter - gatherers in particularly cold environments			0
‘ there is a critical distinction to be made between a harsh childhood and a childhood lived in a harsh environment			0
’ @entity98 may be closer to their @entity9 cousins than previously thought , new research suggests			1
breeding with @entity9 has long been known to have left its traces in the dna of modern @entity98			2
scientists in @entity104 have now confirmed that the genetic similarity between the two must have arisen after interbreeding in @entity98 and @entity107 , before our ancestors spread across the globe			0
previous research speculated that modern @entity98 and @entity107 are related to @entity9 because they originated from a similar sub-population in @entity113			2
both groups evolved from a common ancestor in @entity113 before spreading to other parts of the world			0
the two groups emerged at different times with @entity9 leaving the @entity113 continent more than 200,000 years before humans did			1
now scientists at the @entity123 and @entity124 found the species mated in @entity98 and @entity107 thousands of years ago			0
the research involved dividing up the genetic code of each sub-species to calculate the statistical likelihood of distant or recent interbreeding			0
they traced the biological ties that exist between humans and the ancient species which are believed to have died out around 30,000 years ago			0
the research found that the two per cent of neanderthal dna which exists in people today came from the mating outside of @entity113 .			0

isolated @entity9 groups had a focus on close internal relationships
evidence suggests @entity9 would care for sick children for years
@entity147 played a *key* role in society , particularly in symbolic expression
study of child burials revealed young were given particular attention when they died , with more elaborate graves than older individuals
