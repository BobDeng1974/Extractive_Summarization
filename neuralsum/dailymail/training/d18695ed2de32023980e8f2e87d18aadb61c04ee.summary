after its owners decided to close the business , the club 's workers bought the club for $ 400,000 in 2003			1
the club 's landlord was @entity77 , a strip - joint magnate who was also a partner in @entity78 , a company that owns most of the adult theaters and clubs in @entity4			1
he acquired the building housing the @entity9 in 2001 and more than doubled its rent			0
@entity77 , 71 , had denied that he was evicting the @entity9 because it was a competitor to his other businesses , which number eight strip clubs just in the @entity9 's @entity13 neighborhood , and instead claimed it was because of a default on rent			1
' if i was concerned about [ the competition ] , i ’ve had that building fifteen years now , i could have found a way not to extend their lease for the last ten , ' he told @entity95			0
the venerable @entity9 first opened on @entity10 in the @entity12 strip club district of @entity13 in the 1970s employee shake hands as the @entity9 strip club prepares for closure in the early hours of tuesday morning the @entity101 disagreed , saying , ' you can say it was because you ’re delinquent on rent … but the truth is that there ’s $ 80,000 that walks through this door every month that , once you close , is likely going to go to one of [ @entity111 ’s ] other establishments in the neighborhood , ' said @entity115 ' @entity114 ' @entity113 , the @entity9 ’s general manager			1

@entity111 business partner is @entity134 , known as the ' @entity135 of @entity136 '			0
according to sfgate , @entity134 , @entity111 and their companies have recently been named in a federal lawsuit that alleges the ' leases ' they force their lap dancers to sign for their stage time are a scam designed to avoid their legal responsibility to pay minimum wage and employment taxes			0
people congregate outside the @entity9 strip club on monday - the last ever evening for the local institution forced to close @entity152 impersonators dance in the entrance lobby of the @entity9 strip club on its final night ' @entity134 and @entity111 have created an elaborate scheme of corporations , business entities , trusts , straw men , consulting agreements and licensing agreements , all for the specific purpose of concealing their ownership , operation or control of these clubs , and avoid compliance with various federal and state labor laws , ' said the suit , filed in april on behalf of five @entity78 dancers			1
many see this latest closure of a @entity4 institution as a sign the city is losing the eclectic small businesses and liberal attitude that has made it so culturally rich			0
