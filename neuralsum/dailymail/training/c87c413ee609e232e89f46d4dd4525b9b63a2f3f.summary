by @entity0 published : 13:16 est , 31 january 2013 updated : 14:49 est , 31 january 2013 @entity1 was just four months old when he died after a five - stone television fell on his head a woman whose four - month - old son died when she knocked a five - stone television set on to his head while she was high on drink and drugs has been jailed for 15 months			1
@entity9 , 25 , put her ' self - indulgent drugs lifestyle ' ahead of the welfare of her son , @entity12 , who died from ' catastrophic injuries ' , said the @entity14 , judge @entity15			1
the baby was lying on his changing mat at the family home in @entity19 , @entity20 , when the defendant attempted to move the tv to plug in a scart lead and watch a dvd			1
while giving evidence at her trial she tried to shift the blame to the boy ’s father , her ex-partner @entity28 , 41 , and said she was upstairs in bed at the time			1
she denied she had been under the influence of drugs when her son died but tests later showed she had taken heroin and valium			2
@entity28 had also taken drink and drugs and had passed out on the kitchen floor at their address in @entity43 on december 6 , 2011			2
both pleaded guilty to child cruelty on the basis of neglect during their trial at @entity49 last month			1
@entity1 , of @entity50 , @entity51 , was cleared of manslaughter by gross negligence but judge @entity54 said today that he was satisfied it was she who actually moved the television through ' foolishness '			2
@entity28 , of @entity60 , @entity61 , failed to attend for his sentencing and a warrant for his arrest was issued			2
sentencing @entity1 , the judge said : ' over the short life of your child it is apparent that both you and your partner gave priority to your selfish and self - indulgent drugs lifestyle and neglected the welfare of @entity74			1
' on the night he died , both of you were so intoxicated by drugs and alcohol that you probably forgot all about him with the tragic consequence that he died			1
' @entity9 ( left ) tried to shift the blame to the boy 's father , her ex-partner @entity28 ( right ) , claiming she was upstairs when the tv fell on @entity12 who was just four months old when he died the judge said it was clear that @entity1 had been concealing the extent of her drug addiction from @entity88 and health teams for a long time			1
she also hid her relationship with @entity28 , who was known to @entity88 for previous welfare issues with other children			0
' had you revealed the true position , it is at least a possibility that steps would have been taken to address those issues and that @entity12 ’s welfare might have been better safeguarded , ' said judge @entity54			0
' quite remarkably in your evidence , which i have re-read , you never said you were sorry for what happened			0
in reality there is no mitigation in your case			0
' @entity108 , defending , said : ' this has been a long road to recovery for this woman and it is indeed one that continues			0
' there is the expression of remorse in the plea tendered			0
it was an expression which , we submit , was one of proper remorse when free of drugs and on mature reflection she recognised she had offended in this form and recognises she needs to be punished			0
' this is a young woman who is emotionally detached			0
this emotional detachment may be long term by reason of her own life by what occurred in infancy and subsequently in adolescence			0
' he added @entity1 had made ' considerable improvement ' since descending to the ' depths of the spiral of drink and drugs ' and could see a future for herself .			2
