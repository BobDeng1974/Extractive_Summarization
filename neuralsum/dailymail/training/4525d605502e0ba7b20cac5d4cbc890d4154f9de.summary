by @entity0 a student has written a touching email thanking another teenage boy from a rival school after he fell to the ground during a ' nightmarish ' cross country competition and was helped up and supported by the boy until he completed the race			1
@entity9 , 17 , from @entity11 @entity10 in @entity12 , did n't get a chance to thank the student he knew only as ' @entity14 ' from @entity15 in southeast @entity16			1
but after @entity14 had sacrificed his place in the race and stayed with him , at times physically supporting him , @entity9 was so surprised by @entity14 's level of sportsmanship that he wrote a long email expressing his thanks to @entity15 's principal @entity23			1
@entity9 ( left ) was helped by rival student @entity14 ( right ) after he collapsed during a cross country race in @entity16 on june 4 @entity25 , from @entity15 , sacrificed his place in the race in order to stay with @entity9 , from @entity11 @entity10 , and help him get across the finish line ' i am writing to you to express my most humble and sincere gratitude and thanks to one of your year 12 students , ' @entity9 wrote about his encounter with @entity14 at the @entity37 in @entity16 on june 4			1
' i had what could probably be described as a nightmarish experience when , about 4 kilometres into the 6 kilometre race , i collapsed on the ground , due to a combination of dehydration , exhaustion and heatstroke			1
@entity9 explained that after being given the all clear from a medical team he continued on , ' desperately wanting to finish the race '			1
' very soon , towards the bottom of what we refer to as " @entity53 , i was joined by a student of your school who was also competing , ' @entity9 's email continued			1
' realising i was in distress , he began to give me encouragement , support and i believe slowed down considerably to stay with me			0
' before i crossed the line , i fell twice more – each time , he stopped and helped me get back up and continue – at times physically supporting me , holding onto my arm			2
' @entity9 first collapsed about 4 km into the 6 km race , due to a combination of dehydration , exhaustion and heatstroke ' this came to a head in the last 200 meters , when he displayed an incredible amount of selflessness and remained with me right until the finish line – evidently not concerned with finishing ahead of or faster than me			1
' @entity9 added that he hoped @entity14 's story was shared and that received the acknowledgement he deserved			1
' i ca n't help but feel that we would be much better off with more young men like him			0
' perhaps in the heat of the moment , he did n't realise the impact he had had on me , but in a time when i was at my most vulnerable , he showed myself and the crowd of onlookers that sometimes , the result is n't important - it 's about the respect and brotherhood that comes about from schoolboy sport			0
' i continue to be in awe of his actions			0
' @entity14 told @entity89 he had read the email and thought it was ' very nice but probably a bit unnecessary ' the boy , who has since been identified at 17 - year - old @entity25 , told @entity89 he had read the email and thought it was ' very nice but probably a bit unnecessary '			1
' i do n't even understand really			0
it 's very surprising , ' he said			0
@entity14 said he was a bit confused about the interest in his act of sportsmanship , after it was mentioned at school assemblies , run in the school newsletter and shared online			1
' one of my teachers at school said there 's quite a lot of competition around the gps events and it was quite nice to hear that someone had something more sportsmanlike than trying to get ahead , ' he said			1
' i saw him quite a few times he was almost falling over , we were at the bottom of what a lot of people call @entity118 and he was not looking good so i just said " hi " and wanted to give him a bit of encouragement			2
@entity9 said he hoped @entity14 's story was shared and that received the acknowledgement he deserved ' you think anyone … i hope they would do the same thing in my situation			1
' @entity14 said he had n't spoken to @entity9 since the race but he would like to			1
' my head teacher told me he was in hospital			2
i would definitely be asking about that , ' he said			0
' he had some sort of appendix problem , i do n't know if that contributed to his race issue			2
' @entity14 's principal mr @entity23 said @entity14 was a ' ripper young man '			1
' he 's very quiet and unassuming , ' he said			0
' he 's a very nice young man and he just noticed another young man being quite distressed and was keen to go to his aid			2
' dear mr @entity23 and mr @entity139 , i am writing to you to express my most humble and sincere gratitude and thanks to one of your year 12 students , in the hope that it may be passed on and his actions recognised in light of what happened between him and i at the recent @entity37 on june 4 ( last wednesday as i write )			0
as an open runner in year 12 who has represented @entity151 at the championships for the last 5 years , i had what could probably be described as a nightmarish experience when , about 4 kilometres into the 6 kilometre race , i collapsed on the ground , due to a combination of dehydration , exhaustion and heatstroke			1
i lay there for about 5 minutes ( although thankfully there were coaches on hand ) until a medical buggy arrived			0
after being cleared by the medico , and desperately wanting to finish the race , i got up and continued to complete the course			2
at this point , only 2 runners in the opens race had yet to pass where i had been			2
very soon , towards the bottom of what we refer to as ' heartbreak ' hill , i was joined by a student of your school who was also competing			2
realising i was in distress , he began to give me encouragement , support and i believe slowed down considerably to stay with me			0
this continued to the top of the hill , and right until the finish			0
before i crossed the line , i fell twice more – each time , he stopped and helped me get back up and continue – at times physically supporting me , holding onto my arm			2
this came to a head in the last 200 meters , when he displayed an incredible amount of selflessness and remained with me right until the finish line – evidently not concerned with finishing ahead of or faster than me			0
i finished with him , and unfortunately i did n't get the opportunity to express my thanks as he disappeared into the crowd			0
all i caught at the time was his name – @entity14 – but i can honestly say that his actions represented the most sportsmanlike and rare example of character i have ever witnessed in a person			1
finishing that race was probably one of the hardest things i have ever had to do , but i certainly would have failed without him			0
after a bit of searching , i found that his name was @entity25 , and that @entity211 had been his first race of the season			1
the lengths i went to make contact with him were unsuccessful in the days following			0
i simply want to express what a fine representative of @entity15 that @entity14 was – what was probably my first ever interaction with one of your students is one which i doubt i will forget for a long , long time			1
i would hope that his story is shared and that he receives the plaudits and acknowledgement he deserves , because i ca n't help but feel that we would be much better off with more young men like him			0
perhaps in the heat of the moment , he did n't realise the impact he had had on me , but in a time when i was at my most vulnerable , he showed myself and the crowd of onlookers that sometimes , the result is n't important - it 's about the respect and brotherhood that comes about from schoolboy sport			0
i continue to be in awe of his actions			0
i still would love to be able to thank @entity14 personally , but until i could do that , i simply felt compelled to retell his story to yourselves			2
