threatened with arrest : @entity1 was warned by @entity3 officials that she risked arrest for exposes flaws in the country 's judicial system @entity1 was warned by @entity3 officials that she risked being arrested for presenting a report which exposes flaws in the country 's judicial system			1
the human rights lawyer , who recently married @entity14 star @entity13 , was issued with the threat after identifying the same cracks in the system that led to the conviction of three @entity20 journalists			1
written before mrs @entity1 became involved in the @entity20 case , officials considered the report highly controversial for its criticisms of @entity3 's courts			1
speaking to @entity29 's @entity28 after the journalists ' appeal hearing this week , she said : ' when i went to launch the report , first of all they stopped us from doing it in @entity34			1
' they said " does the report criticise the army , the judiciary , or the government ? " we said " well , yes "			2
they said " well then , you 're risking arrest "			0
' the report , compiled on behalf of the @entity44 , suggested @entity3 's judicial system was insufficiently independent			1
it highlighted the fact that officials in the ministry of justice have too much power over judges and the government too much control over public prosecutors			2
mrs @entity1 and her team recommended the practice that allows @entity3 officials to handpick judges for particular cases must stop			1
she added : ' that recommendation was n't followed , and we 've seen the results of that in this particular case where you had a handpicked panel led by a judge who is known for dispensing brutal verdicts			0
' the three @entity20 journalists represented by mrs @entity1 are @entity70 , @entity71 , and @entity72			0
the group was initially sentenced to between seven and ten years in prison last june by the controversial @entity3 judge @entity75			0
a few months later he gained further infamy after sentencing 188 people to death in one mass trial			0
the three journalists launched a new appeal yesterday - but mrs @entity1 suggested she fears the flaws highlighted in her report will prevent the group from receiving a fair trial			0
the men have been held since december 2013 - with their arrests coming after the overthrow of @entity101 president @entity100 , a @entity102 member			0
' hope ' : @entity72 ( left ) , @entity70 ( centre ) and @entity71 ( right ) will face a retrial one of the defendants , @entity71 , hold an @entity3 passport - and must pin his hopes on his sentence being overturned by the @entity3 courts			2
but @entity1 's other clients , mr @entity72 , a @entity112 citizen , and his @entity114 colleague mr @entity70 , are still hoping for deportation to their home countries			0
both have applied to @entity3 's chief prosecutor to demand they be sent to @entity112 and @entity114 under the terms of a new presidential decree that gives foreign prisoners such an option			2
inside @entity3 , mr @entity72 's appeals team was led by an @entity3 lawyer with contributions from @entity1 that related to international law - but outside the country she is the one leading the efforts to win deportation			1
wedding of the year : @entity1 married @entity13 in @entity130 in september last year - seven months after her legal team produced a report exposing flaws in @entity3 's judiciary system			1

human rights lawyer produced report before taking on @entity20 clients
@entity3 officials warned she could be arrested for criticising government
she was prevented from presenting the report in @entity34 on this basis
her team 's findings suggested courts were not sufficiently independent
