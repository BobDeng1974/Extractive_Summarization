by @entity0 who should be @entity2 's next captain ? bookmakers have already installed @entity4 as favourite to be @entity2 ’s next captain in the wake of @entity9 ’s international retirement			1
as if they had much choice			0
it ’s not through @entity4 being the stand - out candidate , rather he is the best of an average bunch - as was painfully obvious with the dismal elimination from the @entity16 after just two group games			2
@entity4 at least has the benefit of previous , short - lived captaincy experience for his country and has been @entity23 ’s on - off skipper in recent years			1
that would certainly improve the 28 - year - old scouser ’s cause in the eyes of @entity2 boss @entity38			2
if it ’s good enough for @entity41 , then it should be good enough for @entity38			0
on the international front , @entity4 has played almost 100 games for his country and that sort of experience is invaluable , even if it is the experience of never winning anything			1
when he made his senior international debut at the age of just 17 in february 2003 , he was @entity2 ’s youngest international cap			1
that ’s an enviable record , although since eclipsed by @entity53			0
@entity4 has matured on and off the field since those early days wearing the @entity2 and , as an established figure for club and country , now commands respect among his peers			1
fresh start : @entity4 jokes with new @entity23 manager @entity41 on their pre-season tour of the @entity64 but his performance in @entity2 ’s @entity16 defeat by @entity67 , when cast out in an unfamiliar wide position , may have blotted his copybook in the eyes of the manager			1
a captain is expected to lead from the front , even when it does not suit , not sulk on the fringes			0
if not @entity4 , then who ? @entity78 defender @entity77 is another early front - runner to carry the armband as @entity38 ’s side look to banish the bitter memory of their dire campaign in @entity85			1
@entity38 wants to rebuild with youth ahead of @entity87 and @entity77 , like @entity4 , is at just the right time in his career for the responsibility			1
in contention : @entity91 ( centre ) has been a regular starter under @entity38 @entity38 , as a traditionalist , may prefer a defender to be barking orders as captain from the back rather than relying on a striker to get the message through on the field			2
forwards can be detached from the action further back and that will form part of @entity38 ’s thinking			0
while the late , great @entity107 is perhaps @entity2 ’s most well - known and well - loved skipper , there have been strikers who have worn the armband in the post-war years			2
@entity111 and @entity112 share the distinction			0
if @entity38 does not fancy a striker , he may fancy a goalkeeper even less			0
@entity116 is another who tops the list of early favourites , but @entity119 or @entity120 he is not			2
experienced : @entity116 has been @entity2 's established no 1 for some time the @entity123 stopper was backed for the @entity2 captaincy by fans and pundits alike as far back as 2012 , with many favouring a string of emphatic performances			1
but his form last season dipped and that leaves a question mark over his club future			0
city boss @entity135 sees £ 6million summer signing @entity136 as providing real competition for @entity116 next season and it would be a brave @entity2 manager who has as his captain a player not even guaranteed first - team football at club level			1
beyond the obvious front - runners , the strength of the @entity2 candidates tail off dramatically directly proportional to their number of caps			0
end of an era : @entity9 captained @entity2 from the @entity16 in 2010 @entity153 duo @entity152 and @entity154 have been thrown into the hat , for no other obvious reason , it appears , than they have played for their country			1
@entity159 has yet to prove his maturity and consistency beyond a good season with @entity163 last time around			0
and @entity165 ’s slender chances would appear to have gone up in smoke with that picture of him partying in @entity168 so soon after @entity2 ’s elimination from @entity85			0
@entity116 was also in that picture , which may perhaps have done his hopes even more harm than the fact he may not be playing for @entity123 next term .			0

@entity9 has retired from international football
@entity9 had been captaining @entity2 since 2010
@entity4 favourite to be next @entity2 captain
