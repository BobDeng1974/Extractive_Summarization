a school which gave out @entity1 to every pupil in hope of improving their education has admitted that just a year later half the costly devices have been broken			1
@entity6 dished out @entity8 tablets to its 1,200 pupils a year ago , at vast cost to the taxpayer			1
despite warnings that children would not be able to look after the fragile computer tablet , the school in @entity13 , @entity14 , allowed children to take the device outside the classroom , playground and street and home at evenings and weekends			2
expensive : @entity6 in @entity14 admitted that half the @entity1 given out last year have been broken it was hoped that the @entity1 would be a useful learning tool , as well as keep the school up to pace with international competitors embracing the technology in the classroom			1
but after just one year , more than four in ten of the @entity1 had been sent off for repair , after being knocked , dropped or scratched			1
figures obtained under the @entity32 reveal 489 had to be replaced after being found to be beyond repair			2
about a fifth of those sent for repair – 112 – had to be sent back more than once			0
pupils said in some of the younger classes , around half the class had broken their tablet at least once , and some as many as three times			1
despite the threat of confiscation after three tablets , ultimately none were taken away from pupils			1
the school said the @entity1 have helped improve pupil discipline and exam results the school argues that since introducing the devices , it has seen improvements in pupil discipline , attendance , and exam results			1
@entity53 , the manufacturer of @entity1 , is said to be aggressively targeting the school market and at the time headteachers were accused of ‘ falling for a gimmick ’			0
@entity6 , which gained academy status last year , giving it greater control over its budget , gave out the tablets last september , at an estimated cost of £ 500,000 , or £ 400 per @entity1			1
parents were asked only to pay £ 50 towards insuring the device			0
at the time headteacher @entity64 said the investment represented 2.3 per cent of the school ’s budget , and did not want to publicise the scheme for fear of putting the safety of pupils at risk			1
on the latest figures , he said : ‘ the breakage rate resulted from using a recommended case which was insufficiently robust			0
since replacing cases this year , breakage has fallen to 1.2 per cent			2
’ he added : ‘ exam results at the end of our first year of using tablets were the highest in the school ’s 48 - year history			2
‘ @entity84 has risen and we ’ve seen our lowest rate of fixed - term exclusions for ten years			0
’ @entity87 , a former school headmaster and a commentator on education , said the breakages were hardly surprising			0
he said : ‘ in my view you can not expect children of 11 and 12 to be responsible for a delicate gadget			0
‘ they are still running around using jumpers for goal - posts and being generally rambunctious			0
’ handing out equipment without expecting the parents to contribute financially only increases the likelihood of something being lost or damaged , he added			0
@entity103 , of the @entity104 ’ @entity102 , said : ‘ buying technology for schools has to be about educational results , not just trying to appear cutting edge for the sake of it			0
‘ not many parents would trust their 11 - year - old to look after such an expensive piece of kit so it is wrong for the school to do so just because taxpayers are picking up the bill			2
