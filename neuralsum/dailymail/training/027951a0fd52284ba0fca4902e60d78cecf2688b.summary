by @entity0 published : 08:00 est , 12 june 2013 updated : 06:15 est , 13 june 2013 an @entity2 cell was feared to be in possession of a missile launcher capable of taking down a commercial aircraft after blueprints and instructions for the weapon were discovered at a training camp in @entity10			1
the 26 - page document in @entity12 strongly suggests the group now possesses the @entity15 surface - to - air missile , known to the @entity16 , according to terrorism specialists			1
photocopies of the manual , which contained a detailed guide , diagrams and photographs , lay in heaps on the floor of a building once occupied by the terror group in the @entity27 in @entity28			1
the manual , recovered by @entity30 , also confirms that the @entity2 cell is actively training its fighters to use these weapons , also called man - portable air - defense systems , or @entity34 , which likely came from the arms depots of @entity37 dictator @entity36			1
deadly : a @entity39 soldier holds a @entity15 surface - to - air missile launcher in @entity28 , @entity10			1
the weapon is feared to be in the hands of @entity2 after a manual was found at a terror training camp in the town @entity47 analyst @entity46 , a former adviser to the @entity49 ' military command in @entity50 and an instructor to @entity52 , said : ' the existence of what apparently constitutes a " @entity55 to @entity34 " is strong circumstantial evidence of @entity57 having the missiles			1
' why else bother to write the guide if you do n't have the weapons ? if @entity57 not only has the @entity34 , but also fighters who know how to use them effectively , then the impact is significant , not only on the current conflict , but on security throughout @entity66 and @entity50 , and possibly beyond			1
' this is not the first @entity2 - linked group thought to have @entity34 : they were circulating in @entity69 and @entity70 , and a terror cell in @entity72 recently claimed to have the @entity15 in a video			1
but the @entity49 desperately wanted to keep the weapons out of the hands of @entity2 's largest affiliate on the continent , based in @entity10			1
in the spring of 2011 , before the fighting in @entity80 had even stopped , a @entity49 team flew to @entity81 to secure @entity36 's stockpile of thousands of heat - seeking , shoulder - fired missiles			1
by the time they got there , many had already been looted			0
the manual is believed to be an excerpt from a terrorist encyclopedia edited by @entity91			1
not the first time : a terror cell in @entity72 recently claimed to have a surface - to - air missile like this one			1
but the @entity49 desperately wanted to keep the weapons out of the hands of @entity2 's largest affiliate on the continent , based in @entity10 it adds to evidence for the weapon found by @entity39 forces during their land assault in @entity10 earlier this year , including the discovery of the @entity15 's battery pack and launch tube , according to military statements and an aviation official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was n't authorised to comment			1
the knowledge that the terrorists have the weapon has already changed the way the @entity39 are carrying out their five - month - old offensive in @entity10			1
they are using more fighter jets rather than helicopters to fly above its range of 1.4 miles ( 2.3km ) from the ground , even though that makes it harder to attack the jihadists			0
they are also making cargo planes land and take off more steeply to limit how long they are exposed , in line with similar practices in @entity70 after an @entity129 hit the wing of a @entity132 cargo plane in 2003			2
concerns : the knowledge that the terrorists have the weapon has already changed the way the @entity39 ( above ) are carrying out their five - month - old offensive in @entity10 in @entity28 , sa - 7 training was likely part of the curriculum at the ' @entity141 ' housed in a former police station , said @entity144 - @entity143 , director of the @entity145 , one of three experts who reviewed the manual for @entity30 it 's located less than three miles ( 5 km ) from the @entity152 's @entity151 building where the manual was found			1
first introduced in the 1960s in the @entity155 , the @entity15 was designed to be portable			2
not much larger than a poster tube , it can be packed into a duffel bag and easily carried			0
it 's also affordable , with some sa - 7s selling for as little as $ 5,000			0
since 1975 , at least 40 civilian aircraft have been hit by different types of @entity34 , causing about 28 crashes and more than 800 deaths around the world , according to the @entity49 @entity165			1
the @entity15 is an old generation model , which means most military planes now come equipped with a built - in protection mechanism against it			1
but that 's not the case for commercial planes and the threat is greatest to civilian aviation			0
in @entity177 in 2002 , suspected @entity176 extremists fired two sa - 7s at a @entity179 757 carrying 271 vacationers back to @entity181 , but missed			0
insurgents in @entity70 used the weapons , and @entity185 videos abound purporting to show @entity187 rebels using the @entity15 to shoot down regime planes			2
an @entity15 tracks a plane by directing itself toward the source of the heat , the engine			2
it takes time and practice , however , to fire it within range			0
the failure of the jihadists in @entity10 so far to hit a plane could mean that they can not position themselves near airports with commercial flights or that they are not yet fully trained to use the missile			1
@entity203 , director of the @entity204 at @entity205 , said : ' there 's a paradox here			0
on the one hand , it 's not easy to use , but against any commercial aircraft there would be no defenses against them			2
it 's impossible to protect against it			0
' neighbors say they saw foreign fighters running laps each day , carrying out target practice and inhaling and holding their breath with a pipe - like object on their shoulder			0
the drill is standard practice for shoulder - held missiles , including the @entity15			2
as the jihadists fled ahead of the arrival of @entity39 troops who liberated @entity28 on january 28 , they left the manual behind , along with other instructional material , including a spiral - bound pamphlet showing how to use the @entity235 anti-aircraft machine gun and another on how to make a bomb out of ammonium nitrate , among other documents retrieved by the @entity30 residents said the jihadists grabbed reams of paper from inside the building , doused them in fuel and set them alight			1
however , numerous buildings were still full of scattered papers			0
' they just could n't destroy everything , ' said neighbor @entity248			0
' they appeared to be in a panic when the @entity39 came			2
they left in a state of disorder			0
' the manual is illustrated with grainy images of @entity155 - looking soldiers firing the weapon			0
point - by - point instructions explain how to insert the battery , focus on the target and fire			0
the manual also explains that the missile will malfunction above @entity264 , the temperature in the deserts north of @entity28			2
and it advises the shooter to change immediately into a second set of clothes after firing to avoid detection			0
its pages are numbered 313 through 338 , suggesting they came from elsewhere			0
@entity274 , an expert on @entity176 extremists at the @entity276 , believes the excerpts are lifted from the @entity278 , an 11 - volume survey on the craft of war first compiled by the @entity282 in the 1990s and later codified by @entity91			1
@entity91 , who led a contingent of @entity285 fighters in @entity69 at the time , paid to have the encyclopedia translated into @entity12 , according to @entity274 , author of a book on @entity2 's @entity289 branch			2
however , the cover page of the manual boasts the name of @entity57			0
' it 's a way to make it their own , ' said @entity274			0
' it 's like putting a logo on something			0
it shows the historic as well as the present link between @entity2 core and @entity57			0
' from the top : the manual is believed to be an excerpt from a terrorist encyclopedia edited by @entity91 @entity91 later assembled a team of editors to update the manual , put it on cd - roms and eventually place it on the internet in a move that lay the groundwork for the globalisation of jihad , according to terrorism expert @entity316 , who was the director of research at the @entity318 when the @entity2 encyclopedia was first found			1
@entity320 , an arms expert in @entity321 , confirmed that the information in the manual in @entity28 on the missile 's engagement range , altitude and weight appeared largely correct			1
he cautions though that the history of the @entity15 is one of near - misses , specifically because it takes training to use			2
' even if you get your hands on an @entity15 , it 's no guarantee of success , ' he said			2
' however , if someone manages to take down a civilian aircraft , it 's hundreds of dead instantly			0
it 's a high impact , low - frequency event , and it sows a lot of fear			0

26 - page document found in building occupied by terror group in @entity28
contains detailed guide , photos and diagrams of @entity15 surface - to - air missile
thought to be excerpt from terror encyclopedia edited by @entity91
weapons , known as @entity34 , capable of bringing down commercial plane
terror expert : ' why bother to write guide if you do n't have the weapons ? '
likely to have come from arms depots of @entity81 dictator @entity36
@entity39 is now taking precautions with aircraft during offensive in @entity10
