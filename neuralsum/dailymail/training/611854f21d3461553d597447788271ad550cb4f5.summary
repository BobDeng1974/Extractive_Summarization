by @entity0 a second world war bomber nicknamed ' @entity2 ' which was never shot down despite flying 128 missions is to be celebrated on the 70th anniversary of its first mission			1
the @entity7 bomber got its black - humoured name after @entity9 lost seven of the same bombers in succession , all bearing the registration letter @entity15 when their newest aircraft @entity17 arrived with the registration @entity20 some crewmen refused to fly in it , so pilot officer @entity23 @entity22 gave it the unusual name , decorated it with a grim reaper 's scythe , a skull and crossbones and an upside down horseshoe in order to break the curse			1
she flew a total of 128 missions , more than any other @entity7 aircraft the unusual name was given to the plane after 158 squadron had several aircraft with the registration @entity42 shot down in succession			1
when their new aircraft arrived with the same letter on it , the flight officer decided to try and break the curse flight officer @entity23 @entity22 branded the superstition ' stuff and nonsense ' , named the plane friday the 13th , and painted a skull and crossbones , a @entity57 's scythe and an upside down horseshoe on the side @entity22 even painted an open ladder above the crew hatch so they would have to walk under it as they climbed on board , and painted over the parachute escape hatch on the belly of the plane , but these details were later removed			1
@entity22 's efforts proved successful , and on its very first mission friday the 13th saved the life of its pilot , @entity74 , who was swapped from his regular aircraft on to the new bomber at the last minute			2
@entity74 's regular plane was shot down during that raid on march 30th 1944 , along with 100 other aircraft , but friday the 13th returned to base safely			2
the plane went on to fly a total of 128 missions , more than any other @entity7 aircraft , making it one of the most successful bombers to fly during the war			1
on the bomber 's first mission on march 30 1944 it saved the life of pilot @entity92 who was swapped from his regular aircraft on to the new one at the last minute			1
his old plane was shot down , but friday returned to base unscathed the original friday the 13th was scrapped after the end of the war along with all other @entity7 aircraft , but the @entity99 have rebuilt it from spare parts			1
it is the only surviving @entity7 anywhere in the world there were more than 6,000 @entity7 aircraft built during the @entity34 to fly heavy bomber missions into @entity107 , but their role in the conflict is often overshadowed by their more well known contemporary the @entity111 which completed the famous dam - busters raid seventy years after its first outing , the story of the famous aircraft which cheated disaster time and time again is being remembered at the @entity99 with the only complete @entity118 in the world			1
the @entity99 at @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 , proudly displays an exact replica of friday the 13th , which was unceremoniously scrapped after the war , at the @entity125 at @entity126			2

however , standing as a tribute to all air and ground crews of @entity138 , it draws visitors from all over the world			0

we 've had a lot of visitors from @entity165 and @entity179 who have discovered relatives who were in service and are hoping to retrace their steps			0
' talking about the restoration work , mr @entity127 added : ' it has been a real labour of love			0
we have had lots of different people working on it over the years and some who are no longer with us , but there has always been people willing get involved with the project			0
