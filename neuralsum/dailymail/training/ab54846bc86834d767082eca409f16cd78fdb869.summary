by @entity1 reporter plain packaging for cigarettes could be the ' game changer ' in seeing long - term reductions in smoking among young people , health officials have said			1
@entity8 ( @entity9 ) said that the evidence for the benefits of introducing standardised packing for cigarettes and other tobacco products is now ' irrefutable '			1
in @entity16 , where the measure was introduced in december 2012 , there has been the fastest decline in smoking rates for over 20 years , according to @entity9 - an arm 's length body of the @entity22			1
@entity8 ( @entity9 ) said that the evidence for the benefits of introducing standardised packing for cigarettes and other tobacco products into the @entity24 is now ' irrefutable ' ( file picture ) standardised packaging increases the effect of health warnings on cigarette boxes and helps to de-normalise smoking , it said			1
responding to a consultation on the proposed measure , @entity9 said : ' as a powerful addition to the existing levers at our disposal , we believe standardised packaging could be the game changer			2
' the evidence is clear that standardised packaging increases the effectiveness of health warnings and reduces the appeal of cigarette packaging to young people and adults			1
it removes a powerful marketing tool and the ability to influence perceptions about the relative risk between cigarette brands			2
' standardised packaging influences behaviour , encouraging smokers to reduce their smoking and to quit			1
' as part of a comprehensive programme of tobacco control , standardised packaging makes a powerful contribution to the de-normalisation of smoking as a socially acceptable behaviour			1
the potential benefits to public health should not be underestimated			2
' @entity62 is one of the nation 's most serious public health challenges , with the greatest harm suffered by the least advantaged in society			2
the evidence for the benefits standardised packaging can deliver is now irrefutable			1
to delay its introduction is to delay our receipt of those benefits			2
' professor @entity76 , national director of health and wellbeing at @entity9 , added : ' smoking remains the biggest cause of premature mortality in @entity8 , accounting for 80,000 deaths every year			1
' standardised packaging is a powerful measure that would help to save lives			0
the evidence from @entity16 is adding to the substantial and irrefutable case that the absence of attractive packaging works to reduce the number of smokers , as well as encouraging others to cut down			1
' the consultation , which closes tomorrow , was put out to help @entity24 governments to decide whether or not introduce the measure			0
it was launched by the @entity22 after a recent review concluded the initiative could contribute to a ' modest but important reduction ' in smoking rates			1
in @entity16 , where the measure was introduced in december 2012 , there has been the fastest decline in smoking rates for over 20 years ( file picture ) the sir @entity105 review suggested that the measure , which would see cigarettes and other tobacco products put in drab and purposefully unattractive packaging , would contribute to a reduction in the prevalence of smoking			1
health experts have long campaigned for the measure to be introduced , saying that brightly coloured packages are the last marketing ploy that tobacco companies use to lure people to their products			0
but smoking groups claimed that stripping cigarette packets of branding would lead to an increase in illicit trade of tobacco products and job losses			2
in december 2012 , @entity16 became the first country in the world to put all tobacco products in standardised packs			1
the law banned the use of logos , brand imagery , symbols , other images , colours and promotional text			0
cigarettes and other tobacco products are now sold in packets which portray a range of gruesome images including dying cancer sufferers , diseased feet and ill babies			0
it is widely expected that if a similar measure was introduced here then packs would look similar to those used in @entity16			1
dr @entity150 , chief executive of the @entity151 , said : ' the need for legislation on standardised packaging for all tobacco products is indisputable and this latest research ( from @entity9 ) shows the wider benefits that society will reap			0
we now look forward to the government introducing standardised packaging at the soonest possible time			0
' @entity163 reiterated its opposition of the measure			0
a spokesman for the group said its petition against the measure has gained more than 100,000 signatures and more than 50,000 people have personally written to the prime minister opposing the initiative			0
group director @entity175 said : ' the response demonstrates the strong level of opposition to this ill - conceived measure			0
we urge the prime minister to think again			0
' there 's no evidence standardised packaging will have any health benefits			2
advocates base their arguments not on facts but on speculation			0
' there must be no rush to legislation			0
it 's a huge step and no government should take it lightly			0

@entity8 says evidence for benefit of plain packs is ' irrefutable '
