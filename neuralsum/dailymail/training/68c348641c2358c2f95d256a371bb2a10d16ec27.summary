@entity4 , a property tycoon who has owned the @entity5 since 1981 , has been roundly condemned after a recording of him ranting at his girlfriend for associating with black people			0
but @entity2 told @entity39 on @entity40 that he believes that @entity4 's remarks are merely the tip of the iceberg , suggesting that there is a deeper problem with race in the @entity8 that few dare to confront			1
' this is a problem , ' he told @entity48 on this week			0
' i did a little bit of research , more whites believe in ghosts than believe in racism ... ' that ’s why we have shows like @entity59 and do n’t have shows like @entity61			0
' it ’s something that ’s still part of our culture and people hold on to some of these ideas and practices just out of habit and saying that , " well , that ’s the way it always was			0
" but things have to change			0
' @entity2 admitted he never experienced any racism from @entity35 during his brief time coaching the @entity5 in 2000 but , referring to charges of racial discrimination filed against him , he said the remarks heard in the recording published by @entity78 ' certainly should not have been a surprise to anybody			1

and we are n’t doing ourselves any good by saying , “ i feel fine			0
" ' citing polls which have shown that black people in the @entity8 are far more likely to flag up racism as a ' very serious ' problem , @entity2 argues that the reason so many white people seem to think that it is ' dead ' is because it does n't target them			1
' that ’s why the best way to combat racism in the face of selective attention and situational racism is to seek it out every minute of every day and expose every instance we find , ' he goes on			2
' and not just racism , but also sexism , homophobia and every other kind of injustice that lessens the principles of inclusion that define this country			0
' @entity2 with @entity148 in a scene from @entity150 : he combined one of the greatest ever careers in basketball with work as an author and actor , and recently as a cultural ambassador for the @entity8 any attempt to force @entity35 to sell the @entity5 would require a vote of approval from at least three - fourths of team owners			1
