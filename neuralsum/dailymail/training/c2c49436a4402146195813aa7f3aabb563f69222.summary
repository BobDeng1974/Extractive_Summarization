by @entity0 published : 17:54 est , 23 may 2013 updated : 19:57 est , 24 may 2013 the @entity1 threw open its ranks thursday to gay scouts but not gay scout leaders - a fiercely contested compromise that some warned could fracture the organisation and lead to mass defections of members and donors			1
of the roughly 1,400 voting members of the @entity1 's @entity1 who cast ballots , 61 per cent supported the proposal drafted by the governing @entity13			1
the policy change is due to take effect on january 1 next year			0
' while people have different opinions about this policy , we can all agree that kids are better off when they are in @entity21 , ' the @entity1 said after announcing the results at the council 's annual meeting near @entity25			1
@entity41 @entity40 leaders - while supporting the proposal to accept gay youth - have made clear they want the ban on gay adults lifted as well			1
in contrast , conservatives with the @entity1 - including some churches that sponsor scout units - wanted to continue excluding gay youths , in some cases threatening to defect if the ban were lifted			1
' we are deeply saddened , ' said @entity52 , president of the @entity54 's executive committee after learning of the result			0
' homosexual behavior is incompatible with the principles enshrined in the @entity40 oath and @entity40 law			2
' the @entity61 of @entity62 , another conservative denomination , said the policy change ' will lead to a mass exodus from the @entity40 program			1
' @entity67 , left , who was removed from her position as a den leader in 2012 for being gay , hugs @entity27 , 16 , after a resolution passed to allow openly gay scouts in the @entity1 the result was welcomed by many gay - rights groups , which joined in the call for an end to the ban on gay adults			1
' i 'm so proud of how far we 've come , but until there 's a place for everyone in @entity21 , my work will continue , ' said @entity67 , who 's ouster as a cub scout den leader in @entity87 because she is lesbian launched a national protest movement			0
the vote followed what the @entity1 described as ' the most comprehensive listening exercise in @entity21 's history ' to gauge opinions within the community			2
the @entity1 could also take a hit financially			2
many scout units in conservative areas fear their local donors will stop giving if the ban on gay youth is lifted			0
the @entity1 executive committee suggested a plan in january to give sponsors of local @entity40 units the option of admitting gays as both youth members and adult leaders or continuing to exclude them			1
angry : the decision , which still denies adults from serving as @entity40 leaders , is anticipated to upset conservative groups who believe that gays should not be allowed in the @entity1 at all however , the plan won little praise , and the @entity1 changed course after assessing responses to surveys sent out starting in february to members of the @entity120			1
of the more than 200,000 leaders , parents and youth members who responded , 61 per cent supported the current policy of excluding gays , while 34 per cent opposed it			0
however , most parents of young scouts , as while as youth members themselves , opposed the ban			0
the proposal approved thursday was seen as a compromise , and the @entity1 stressed that they would not condone sexual conduct by any scout - gay or straight			1
' @entity1 will not sacrifice its mission , or the youth served by the movement , by allowing the organization to be consumed by a single , divisive , and unresolved societal issue , ' a @entity1 statement said			2
since the executive committee just completed a lengthy review process , ' there are no plans for further review on this matter , ' the group said			0
the @entity1 's overall ' traditional youth membership ' - @entity148 , @entity1 and @entity150 - is now about 2.6 million , compared with more than 4 million in peak years of the past			2
it also has about 1 million adult leaders and volunteers			0
@entity154 , executive director of @entity155 , a pro gay group , reacts to the news that a resolution has been passed to allow openly gay scouts in the @entity1 of the more than 100,000 scouting units in the @entity160 , 70 per cent are chartered by religious institutions			1
those include liberal churches opposed to any ban on gays , but some of the largest sponsors are relatively conservative denominations that have previously supported the broad ban - notably the @entity170 , the @entity171 and @entity54 churches			0
the @entity1 , which celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2010 , has long excluded both gays and atheists			0
protests over the no - gays policy gained momentum in 2000 , when the @entity160 @entity179 upheld the @entity1 's right to exclude gays			2
scout units lost sponsorships by public schools and other entities that adhered to nondiscrimination policies , and several local scout councils made public their displeasure with the policy			0
@entity189 , founder of @entity21 , a pro gay group , wears a neckerchief embroidered with the @entity191 while talking to supporters in @entity193			0

more than 60 *percent* of @entity1 members voted on thursday to allow openly gay boys to join
gay adults remain barred from serving as @entity40 leaders
thursday 's announcement is not expected to satisfy either the conservative or liberal wings of the organization
