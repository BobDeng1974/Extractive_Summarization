by @entity0 published : 09:40 est , 16 august 2012 updated : 10:25 est , 16 august 2012 the mother of the girl who was lost in @entity4 's second - biggest airport for four hours has revealed that @entity5 had no idea where her daughter was and even told her the ten - year - old had reached her final destination			1
@entity10 was flying from @entity11 to @entity12 where she was scheduled to make a connection and fly to @entity14 , @entity15 , for summer camp			1
the person responsible allegedly forgot to pick her up at the gate and accompany her to the next flight			1
her mother @entity21 spoke to the today show about the ordeal and revealed no one at @entity5 seemed to know where her daughter was			1
but every time i asked them they were like " hang on a minute , we are too busy " ' ' all the worst possible things go through your mind when you have no idea where your child is and she 's 2,000 miles away , ' she said			0
' they actually told me she had arrived in @entity15			2
so at that point i really knew that they had lost her at some level			0
they did n’t know where she was			0
' @entity30 's parents only found out their daughter had trouble with the airline once a camp counselor called to say the girl never showed up			0
she said she was put on hold for almost an hour and when the employee came back on the phone she was told they could not help her because her shift was ending			1
' my husband asked her if she was a mother and she said yes , ' mrs @entity10 said			2
' and then he asked her , well how would you feel if your daughter was missing ? ' @entity30 said when someone eventually came and took her to a waiting area , she asked several times if she could call her parents			0
' i knew mom would be worried about me , ' she said			0
' but every time i asked them they were like " hang on a minute , we are too busy "			0
' familiar story : like in @entity75 where the main character is lost in @entity12 's @entity78 airport , @entity10 missed her flight to summer camp multiple mistakes : a friend of the girl 's parents told how @entity5 did not contact the family until the case gained media attention the incident became public after a friend of the couple wrote about their trouble with @entity5 on his blog , bringing the plight of @entity21 and @entity95 who tried to understand how their daughter was left to fend for herself in the airport			1
after an estimated 18 hours of phone calls with @entity5 as they searched for answers , the @entity100 found out that the escorts that the company uses to collect and drop off unaccompanied minors during solo flights are actually managed by a third - party service			1
in their daughter 's case , the representative did n't show up at the gate in @entity12 because they forgot about her			1
on top of that failure , the @entity5 attendants who were on the plane were ' busy and could not help ' the confused girl as she waited for the escort			1
' she asked three times to use a phone to call us and they told her to wait			0
when she missed the flight she asked if someone had called camp to make sure they knew and they told her " yes — we will take care of it "			1
no one did , ' the parents wrote in a letter of complaint to the airline that was reposted on their friend @entity135 's blog			0
' she was sad and scared and no one helped			0
' a @entity5 spokesperson told @entity139 on tuesday that they have reached out to the @entity100 to apologize , and the airline is redepositing the miles used to purchase the ticket into @entity144 's frequent flier account			2
the airline is also refunding the $ 99 unaccompanied minor charge			1
concerned parent : @entity95 , a professor at @entity148 , wrote a letter of complaint that went unanswered and estimates that he and his wife have spent 18 hours on the phone over the issue maze : @entity30 flew from @entity11 ( left ) to @entity12 ( right ) where she was supposed to have an employee escort her to her connecting flight , but the person never showed up the @entity157 reported that eventually , @entity30 was put on a flight to @entity15 four hours later , and because of the confusion her bags were lost and they took three more days to be reconnected with her at camp			1
previous career : before becoming a professor , @entity95 apparently modeled for gap on his blog , mr @entity135 tells of how his friend and colleague @entity166 , who is a professor at @entity148 , has been continually frustrated by @entity5 's treatment and dismissal of the gravity of the situation			2
when on the phone with one customer service representative while @entity30 was still wandering around the @entity12 airport unaccompanied , the representative almost hung up saying that she could be of no more help because her shift was about to end			1
a maternal plea from mrs @entity179 eventually prompted the worker to spend 15 minutes tracking the young girl down herself			0
mr @entity135 says that @entity5 was ' completely unresponsive ' until the couple told a local reporter about the incident and she started asking questions			2
after that pressure , an airline representative contacted them directly and released a statement apologizing for their alleged actions			0
' we reached out directly to the @entity100 to apologize and we are reviewing this matter , ' @entity5 said in a statement to @entity157			2
' what the @entity100 describe is not the service we aim to deliver to our customers			0
we are redepositing the miles used to purchase the ticket back into mr. @entity95 ’s account in addition to refunding the unaccompanied minor charge			1
' @entity30 told her parents that she never wants to fly @entity5 again			2
