by @entity0 published : 19:31 est , 17 february 2014 @entity2 : 20:33 est , 17 february 2014 a couple has been stoned to death for adultery in a remote southwest region of @entity7 on the orders of an @entity10 cleric			1
@entity11 , 25 , and @entity12 , 27 , were killed by a mob led by mrs @entity12 ’s husband in the @entity16 district in @entity17			1
ms @entity12 went into hiding a week ago when the alleged affair was discovered , but then came forward when she heard that the mob had captured mr @entity11 , locals reported			1
a couple was stoned to death in @entity7 after they allegedly had an affair			2
stoning is legal in the country with permission of the courts , though in this instance the stoning occurred illegally she was forced to watch the mob stone mr @entity11 to death before they turned on her			1
the mob , led by her husband and brothers , then threw rocks and bricks at her until she died			0

‘ it is a shameful act and the people involved in stoning the man and the woman will be brought to justice , ’ said @entity55 , the home minister for @entity56			0
in @entity7 , a conviction for murder can carry the death sentence , but despite mr @entity55 ’s outrage , it is widely expected that no action will be taken against the six men police rarely intervene in cases such as this one and the federal courts have little authority in remote regions of the country , including @entity17 , meaning that it is often left to local tribal and religious leaders to mete out punishments , which are usually harsher than the law allows			2
the stoning occurred in the @entity56 region of southwest @entity7 , by a mob led by the woman 's husband and brothers even if cases of so - called ‘ honour killings ’ are brought to court , they often take years to be heard			1
the national conviction rate is between 5 and 10 percent			0
if someone is convicted , the victim 's family can forgive the killers , which is a major loophole considering the killers are often members of the victim ’s family			0
two other couples accused of adultery have been killed in @entity99 in the last two months			0
‘ honour killings ’ for adultery are not uncommon in @entity7 , but stonings are rare			0
last year a young mother of two , @entity103 , no relation to @entity12 , was stoned to death by a mob led by her uncle for carrying a mobile phone in @entity111 province of @entity7			1
