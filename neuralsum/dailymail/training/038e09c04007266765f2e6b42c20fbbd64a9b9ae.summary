@entity0 was the first state to legalize recreational marijuana sales			1
now the state 's voters may consider a ballot measure to allow pot smokers to carry a concealed firearm			1
the ' @entity7 ' is working to put a question on the november 2016 ballot to have @entity0 ignore guidelines from the @entity12 @entity11 about firearms and pot. the measure would change state law to prevent sheriffs from denying concealed carry permits because of marijuana use			1
it 's a new frontier in the marijuana wars , and one that has divided gun - rights activists			0
showing support : @entity25 is one of the organizers of an effort to have a ballot measure placed before voters in the 2016 november election to allow marijuana users to carry concealed firearms ' it 's just ridiculous , ' said @entity25 , one of the campaign organizers , who argues that firearms are n't kept from alcohol drinkers			1
' somebody can get extremely drunk — saturday , sunday , monday , and all week if they want — and they can still get a concealed carry permit			2
' he said he and his campaign partner , @entity42 , who run a firearm training business called ' @entity44 , ' are reaching out to gun rights groups for support , including those involved in last year 's recall of two state senators who supported stricter firearm laws			0
@entity0 organizers need more than 86,100 signatures to send the question to voters , and it 's unclear whether @entity25 's campaign will get enough support to launch			1
the campaign would put @entity0 again in direct conflict with federal guidelines about the drug			0
in 2011 , the @entity12 @entity11 sent states a directive to keep guns away from marijuana users			1
earlier this year , @entity67 sen. @entity66 of @entity68 tried to change that , suggesting an amendment to bar federal prosecution of medical marijuana patients who own firearms			0
the matter divides gun enthusiasts			0
the president of the @entity79 said his members would oppose letting pot users carry guns			1
divided : @entity25 argues pot smokers should be able to carry guns because drunk people can ' federal law prohibits the possession and use of marijuana and its derivatives , and therefore its possession and use is incompatible with legal , responsible firearms ownership , ' said @entity94 , president of the @entity79			1
the @entity95 of @entity0 are lining up against the idea , too			0
but it 's an open debate whether marijuana - using gun owners are more dangerous than others — or even how many people lose gun rights over pot. @entity0 keeps no data on the question			2
and the @entity105 , which runs background checks for applicants and gun buyers , does n't track how many are denied concealed carry permits because of pot. neither does the @entity95 of @entity0			1
drugs and guns : firearm trainers are staging a campaign to have a question put on the november 2016 ballot asking voters to change state law to prevent sheriffs from using marijuana use as a reason to deny a permit people are asked , under oath , 14 questions on @entity0 's concealed carry application , including whether the person has a restraining order , has been convicted of a felony , or has been treated for alcoholism within the past 10 years			1
they 're also asked if they 're ' an unlawful user of ' marijuana ' or any other controlled substance			0
' the application is processed by county sheriffs			0
the conflict has surfaced in other states that allow medical or recreational marijuana use , including @entity139 and @entity140			0
in @entity143 , forms for concealed weapons permits also ask if someone is an " unlawful user " of marijuana , without differentiating between state or federal law			2
in 2012 , the @entity12 @entity148 declined to hear an appeal from an @entity140 sheriff who had been prohibited from denying a concealed handgun license to a medical marijuana user			2
the decision meant the woman and other medical marijuana cardholders could obtain concealed handgun licenses			0
@entity25 , whose company provides the firearm training required for concealed carry applicants , said several students have told him they 've been denied a permit because they use marijuana , either medically or recreationally			1
he said it 's unjust that marijuana users are being ' punished and ca n't defend their lives			2
' he argues that marijuana users can also be responsible firearm owners			2
' it 's going to be that initial battle of educating people			0
the challenge is people thinking that we 're allowing people who are high to possess handguns , ' he said .			0
