by @entity1 reporter stunning x-men star @entity2 claims the secret of her ageless looks is never drinking water out of plastic bottles			1
many people fear chemicals can ‘ leak ’ into the water , causing a toxic build - up in the body , but there is no scientific proof of that			1
now the 48 - year - old @entity16 actress has revealed her fitness regime			1
she also hits the gym regularly , has been seen shading herself from the sun with a parasol while strolling in @entity21 and follows a strict vegan diet			1
i work out whenever i can and i do n’t eat meat or dairy			1
’ @entity2 says she quit eating meat because of her affinity with animals – especially her dog liquorice			1
she said : ‘ when you get that close to an animal , things change and it does n’t seem to matter if it ’s a dog or a chicken or a cow – they all have feelings and all have emotions			1
’ @entity52 of @entity54 women are living with chronic incontinence because they are too embarrassed to seek medical help , according to new research			1
about three - quarters of five million @entity54 women who develop the condition after giving birth fail to contact their gp , despite it being easily treatable			1
many have never spoken to anyone – even their partner – about their problem , according to the poll of 2,000 mothers commisioned by @entity70 , and carried out for the @entity71 and the @entity72			1

a further 16 per cent felt ashamed			1
simple physiotherapy exercises can solve the problem with the pelvic floor – see csp.org.uk / pregnancy			2
no clot : the @entity81 device delivers tiny electrical impulses to the back of the knee @entity86 hospital patients are to be offered a drug - free way to treat post-surgical blood clots , a condition that kills 25,000 @entity54 a year			2
the @entity81 device is a thin , 6in strip that attaches to the leg and delivers tiny electrical impulses to the back of the knee			2
it was approved by the @entity94 this month			2
developed at @entity96 and the @entity97 , it has been designed to help those who are unable to take blood - clot dissolving drugs – the first - line treatment – due to other health problems			2

doctors have discovered a way to treat an uncommon – yet distressing – condition that makes patients belch up to 20 times a minute			0
@entity118 belching is thought of affect thousands of @entity54 and is due to excessive swallowing , meaning air is taken into the oesophagus			0
digestive problems such as irritable bowel syndrome ( @entity124 ) and chronic acid reflux – or heartburn – are also thought to increase risk of developing it			0

some patients say it started with them deliberately belching to ease feelings of bloating or abdominal discomfort , but it then became a habit			0
now , @entity141 and @entity142 experts have used a combination of the muscle relaxant baclofen , and pregabalin , an anticonvulsant used to treat seizures and anxiety , to control the problem			0
the treatment resulted in a greater than 90 per cent drop in the rate of belching , and doctors believe the combination works by reducing sensitivity at the junction between the oesophagus and stomach			0

people who had therapy for fear of spiders at 8am had a greater reduction in symptoms than those treated at 6pm , in a study at @entity168 , @entity141			0

specific phobias are among the most common anxiety disorders , affecting more than one in ten of the population , with fear of spiders one of the most common			0
exposure therapy , where patients are increasingly exposed to spiders , can help , but not everyone benefits			0
drugs have been used to boost the effects of the therapy , and one of the most effective is synthetic cortisol , with a @entity189 study showing that those given it had double the reduction in symptoms seen in those prescribed a placebo .			0
