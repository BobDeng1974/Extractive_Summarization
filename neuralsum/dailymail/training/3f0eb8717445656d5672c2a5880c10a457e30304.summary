it is hard to comprehend the size our galaxy , but now @entity4 has created an incredible panoramic view of the @entity6 that you can tour by clicking a button			1
the star - studded panorama is made up of over two million infrared images taken over the last decade by the space agency ’s @entity11			1
if the image was printed out , a billboard as large as a stadium would be needed to display it , so instead the impressive collection of images can be explored online			2
the 360 - degree mosaic consists of more than 2 million snapshots taken in infrared light over 10 years , beginning in 2003 when @entity29 launched the zoomable 360 ° ‘ mosaic ’ was unveiled at the @entity31 2014 conference in @entity32 and is part of the @entity34 ( @entity36 ) project , which is mapping the plane of our galaxy from all directions			1
it captures about three per cent of our sky , but because it focuses on a band around @entity45 where the plane of the @entity6 lies , it shows more than half of all the galaxy 's stars			2
‘ if we actually printed this out , we 'd need a billboard as big as the @entity57 to display it , ’ said @entity50 , an imaging specialist at @entity4 's @entity52 in @entity53 , @entity54			1
‘ instead , we 've created a digital viewer that anyone , even astronomers , can use			0
’ the @entity11 was launched in 2003 and has spent more than 10 years studying everything from asteroids in our solar system to the most remote galaxies at the edge of the observable universe			1
the centre of the @entity6 galaxy imaged by @entity4 's @entity11 is displayed on a high - definition 23 - foot - wide ( 7metre ) lcd screen at the space agency 's @entity71 in @entity73 , @entity54 it has spent 172 days or 4,142 hours taking pictures of the plane of the @entity6 in infrared light , but this is the first time that the images have been stitched together to form a panoramic view			1
the @entity6 is a flat spiral disk and our solar system sits in the outer third of the galaxy in one of its spiral arms			0
when astronomers look towards the centre of our galaxy they see a crowded region packed full of stars and visible - light telescope can not look very far into the area because the amount of dust increases with distance , blocking visible starlight			0
infrared light , however , travels through the dust and allows @entity29 to view past the galaxy 's centre			2
‘ @entity29 is helping us determine where the edge of the galaxy lies , ’ said @entity101 , co-leader of the glimpse team at the @entity103			0
‘ we are mapping the placement of the spiral arms and tracing the shape of the galaxy			0
’ using the data from the telescope has enabled astronomers to create the most accurate map of the large central collection of stars that marks the centre of the galaxy , showing that the @entity6 is slightly larger than previously thought			0
the data has also revealed that the @entity6 is riddled with bubble structures – cavities around huge stars – which blast wind and radiation into their surroundings			0
experts at @entity4 's @entity127 explained that @entity29 can also see faint stars in the ‘ back country ’ of our galaxy - the outer , darker regions that went largely unexplored before			1
‘ there are a whole lot more lower - mass stars seen now with @entity29 on a large scale , allowing for a grand study , ’ said @entity133 of the @entity103 , co-leader of the glimpse team			0
‘ @entity29 is sensitive enough to pick these up and light up the entire ' countryside ' with star formation , ’ she added			2
the 360 degree view of the @entity6 will be used to guide @entity4 ’s upcoming @entity144 to the most interesting sites of star - formation , where it will make more detailed infrared observations			1
the glimpse data has also revealed that the @entity6 is riddled with bubble structures , which are cavities around huge stars that blast wind and radiation into their surroundings			0
this infrared image shows a striking example of what is called a hierarchical bubble structure , in which one giant bubble , carved into the dust of space by massive stars , has triggered the formation of smaller bubbles ( all circled )			2

@entity167 - studded panorama is composed of two million infrared images taken over 10 years by @entity4 's @entity11
first time the images have been stitched together to form a panoramic view
the mosaic will be used to guide @entity4 ’s upcoming @entity144 to the most interesting sites of star - formation
