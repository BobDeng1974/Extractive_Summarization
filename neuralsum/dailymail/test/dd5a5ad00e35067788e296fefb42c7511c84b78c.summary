taxes will be £ 12billion a year higher under @entity2 than the @entity3 , independent experts warned yesterday – equal to £ 1,052 for every working household			1
the @entity5 said @entity7 's ' vague ' promise to balance the books would allow @entity2 to borrow £ 90billion more than the @entity3 by 2020			1
this would rise to £ 280billion in extra debt by the end of the next decade if @entity2 remained in power			1
@entity5 said @entity7 's ' vague ' promise to balance the books would allow @entity2 to borrow £ 90billion more than the @entity3 by 2020 and this would rise to £ 280b in extra debt by the next decade @entity15 said the assessment showed @entity2 was ' a risk to our recovery , a risk to our economy , a risk to jobs ' the think - tank warned that @entity2 's failure to control borrowing would leave @entity27 ' less well placed to deal with future adverse events ' , such as another recession or the costs of an ageing population			1
but it was also highly critical of the lack of detail in the @entity36 ' plans , saying the party had failed to spell out where it would find tens of billions of pounds in cuts			0
in a withering verdict , it said all the main parties were keeping voters ' in the dark ' about what they would do , adding : ' none of the parties has provided anything like full details of their fiscal plans for each year of the coming parliament			1
' @entity5 director @entity53 said : ' all the parties have told us where they are going to increase spending on things like health , but none have said much about where the pain is going to fall			1
' he said the gap between the parties ' plans was ' bigger than any time since 1992 ' – giving voters a clear choice between more taxes , spending or borrowing			1
conservative plans require @entity72 cuts of £ 30billion , while @entity2 could get away with savings of just £ 1billion			1
@entity74 , deputy director of the @entity5 , added : ' the electorate has a real choice , although it can at best see only the broad outlines of that choice			1
' the @entity5 said @entity2 's plans were broadly compatible with those of its potential post-election partners in the @entity82			1
the @entity84 nationalists want to spend an extra £ 4billion on benefits			2
but in an unflattering assessment , the @entity5 said there was a ' significant disconnect ' between its anti-austerity rhetoric and its plans			1
@entity2 said the think - tank had made ' wrong assumptions ' about its plans			1
@entity93 said : ' the @entity5 has confirmed that the @entity3 are committed to the most extreme spending plans of any political party , with bigger cuts than any other advanced economy in the next three years ' one in ten cancer sufferers need care at home but do not get any support , figures revealed today			1
it means there are around 160,000 cancer sufferers in the @entity27 left housebound by a lack of support			0
the shocking statistics were released by @entity2 as they attacked the ' crisis ' in elderly care			1
separate figures show three - quarters of councils are subjecting vulnerable pensioners to care visits lasting only 15 minutes			0
@entity2 said it would end ' time - limited ' 15 - minute visits by changing the system of paying for care by taking into consideration all of a patient 's health needs , rather than costing them separately			1
the party is also committed to allowing the terminally ill with the ' greatest care needs ' to have the right to die in their own homes			0
the cancer figures were taken from a report by @entity129 which warned of sufferers left housebound , unable to wash or dress themselves – even at risk of soiling themselves – because of a lack of care			2
the @entity136 has highlighted the scandal of hundreds of thousands of frail , elderly people facing ' clock - watch ' care visits with its dignity for the @entity143 campaign			0
health secretary @entity144 has said he is developing new commissioning standards which will discourage 15 - minute visits			0
mr @entity7 has promised to balance day - to - day government spending by 2020 – leaving @entity2 free to continue borrowing around £ 30billion a year for ' investment '			1
by contrast , the @entity36 want to clear the deficit in three years and start paying off @entity27 's £ 1.5trillion debt mountain			2
@entity15 said the assessment showed @entity2 was ' a risk to our recovery , a risk to our economy , a risk to jobs '			1
but the @entity5 also raised major questions about the @entity3 ' spending plans			2
it said they involved ' substantial and almost entirely unspecified spending cuts and tax increases ' , and warned they could mean ' further real cuts to unprotected departments of around £ 30billion '			2
@entity36 plans for £ 12billion in welfare cuts have also not been spelled out in any detail			2
the @entity5 said the @entity170 deserved a ' small tick ' for being the most transparent – although they were also criticised for failure to spell out £ 12billion of planned spending cuts			1
chancellor @entity174 said : ' saving money means taking the difficult decisions so we reduce our debt and keep our economy out of crisis and on an even keel			0
' but mr @entity93 said : ' the @entity5 has confirmed that the @entity3 are committed to the most extreme spending plans of any political party , with bigger cuts than any other advanced economy in the next three years			1
' @entity186 said it confirmed the @entity3 plan a ' cuts bombshell ' , adding : ' we will cut substantially less than the @entity36 plan to cut many public services to the bone and borrow less than the reckless plan from @entity2			2
' all three of the main parties ' education spokesmen revealed they would have no problem with the next education secretary sending their children to private school			0
the @entity203 's @entity202 presenter @entity201 asked the trio if such a choice would be ' acceptable for an education secretary '			0
@entity2 's @entity207 , who was privately educated , said : ' yes			2
' two of his three children go to a state primary school in @entity213 , with the third expected to go to the same school			0
but he has not ruled out switching them to independent schools			0
privately educated schools minister @entity218 – who has no children – immediately said ' yes ' to the question			0
and education secretary @entity221 , who was privately educated but sends her son to a state primary school , replied : ' yes , you do what 's right for the child			0
' @entity229 's @entity228 and the @entity231 's @entity230 also agreed there was no problem with a future education secretary sending their children private – though mr @entity228 added it would be an ' indictment ' of the quality of state schools			0
only 7 per cent of children in the @entity27 are privately educated			0
@entity229 has pledged to bring back grammar schools by converting some comprehensives , but mrs @entity243 said it would be a ' step backwards '			0
the rare frankness about whether they would opt for a private education for their children is in stark contrast to the controversy sparked by @entity252 @entity251 sending her son to the exclusive fee - paying @entity253			0
miss @entity251 had previously criticised @entity254 , now @entity2 's deputy leader , for sending her children to a selective grammar school			2
many politicians on the @entity258 have managed to get their children into elite state schools			0
both @entity260 – who converted to @entity261 after standing down – and atheist @entity186 , bagged places at leading @entity263 for their children			0
both men are married to @entity266 .			0
