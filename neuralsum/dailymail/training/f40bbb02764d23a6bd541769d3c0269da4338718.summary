by @entity0 published : 11:52 est , 8 february 2013 updated : 12:31 est , 8 february 2013 a sleepy @entity2 village is set to become a tourist attraction to rival the world - famous @entity4 thanks to its titling church			1
villagers have discovered that the tower on their ancient limestone church in @entity10 leans at a greater angle than the famous @entity13 landmark			1
the people of @entity15 are hopeful that the @entity16 listed @entity17 's will bring tourists flocking to their picturesque corner of the country			1
leaning tower : @entity22 in @entity15 tilts more than its famous @entity13 counterpart mystery : unlike the people of @entity27 , the @entity10 villagers do not know why their church tower leans villagers conducted the measurements using a linear system and discovered it tilts up to 5.1 degrees to the west , compared to @entity27 's legendary tower , which leans 3.99 degrees to the south - east			1
they are keen to get independent experts to verify their findings and help solve the architectural mystery of what makes it lean			1
there are several theories as to how the tower came to lean , one of which is that the soil that was supposed to go under the building was used elsewhere instead , leaving it lop - sided			2
the tower in @entity49 was completed in the 13th century and began tilting during construction due to inadequate foundations on ground that was too soft			2
it has since been stabilised			2
@entity22 sits in view of a pub and has left many drinkers wondering if they have had one too many			2
the church dates back to the 12th century and the tower and spire were added 200 years later			0
@entity15 has only 220 inhabitants and is mentioned in the @entity62			1
rivals : the tower at @entity22 leans 5.1 degrees compared to @entity27 , which tilts 3.99 degrees among those hoping it will now attract curious sightseers from far and wide are @entity68 , 29 , and his wife @entity69 , 34 , who own the @entity71 pub , which overlooks church			1
the couple , who have a daughter @entity74 , aged one , have owned the pub for six years and held their wedding at @entity22 in 2010			0
mr @entity68 said : ' it would be fantastic if news of our leaning tower attracted lots of visitors because we have a fine view of the church from our pub. ' strangers who drop in at the pub often notice the leaning tower and then joke they must have had too much to drink			0
' the village 's older residents say the tower has always had a tilt			1
they say it is because the church was built on a mound which has shifting soil			0
' we know the ground does n't shift due to ancient burials because the land surrounding the church is non-consecrated and contains no graves			0
attraction : @entity103 landlord @entity68 ( left ) and historian @entity104 hope it will be popular with tourists double take : mr @entity68 said that many drinkers have wondered if they have had one too many ' we hold the key to the church and at the moment it gets just a few visitors , mainly from people @entity115 to see a plaque inside the church which commemorates members of an aircrew who died when their @entity122 bomber crashed nearby in the war			1
' mr @entity124 , 54 , chairman of the @entity125 , is setting up a local history society that will aim to learn more about the distinctive church 's past and shed light on how and why the tower tilts			2
he said : ' it 's an oddity and a well - kept secret , which is probably just as well because @entity15 would n't be able to accommodate all the tourists that would come to see it should it prove to leanmore than @entity27 's tower			1
' the tower in @entity27 has been altered and is now at an angle of around 3.99 degrees , and although our tower still needs to be validated by a theodolite ( an instrument for measuring angles ) we estimate it leans 4.9 to 5.1 degrees			1
' although you have other striking church towers in @entity2 such as the @entity147 and the crooked tower in @entity149 , this is a quirky tower which we are proud of			0
' anyone wanting to explore the village 's quirky tower may have to wait , however , as it is desperately in need of repairs			2
fingers crossed : villagers are planning to have their findings independently verified by experts historic : @entity22 dates back to the @entity161 , with its tower and spire added 200 years later mr @entity124 said : ' we need to raise at least Â£ 50,000 to carry out essential refurbishment			0
' we will be applying to funds and for grants , and we are holding village events we hope can raise some money			1
' we would love to get sponsorship from local businesses or organisations			0
we are also planning leaflets in the next few weeks with the information we know about the church			0
' mr @entity104 , 77 , local resident and historian , said : ' we live with the tower and we are proud of it			0
it 's a great landmark			0
i remember i could n't believe my eyes when i first saw it as i drove off the @entity184			0
' it 's a source of great conversation in the local pub. we want it to be measured properly so we are looking for someone to come forward to help us with that			0

but the reason behind why the @entity16 listed structure leans is a mystery
people of @entity15 hope it will have tourists flocking to their village
