there are a million women who would n't mind swapping places with @entity3			1
unlike the rest of the nation 's females , @entity6 's beautiful @entity5 girlfriend is lucky enough to enjoy the smouldering @entity11 star for real			1
the 29 - year - old actress may not yet be a household name but she 's also a long way off being just @entity6 's squeeze with a blossoming acting career of her own			1
they are very much a couple whose stars are in the ascendant			1
they say @entity29 has helped ... and he is clearly smitten with his girlfriend of four years			1
in an interview with the @entity34 this weekend , the 31 - year - old @entity32 says that while many couples , particularly those in the limelight , might have seen their relationship foundering under the pressure of work commitments , they did n't have that problem			1
' you meet someone , you fall in love , then you can only see them over @entity29 or phone calls or texts and emails			0
and you have this whole other side to your relationship and it 's ... it was fun			2
he continues : ' we knew we really wanted to be together			0
and knew if we could do that , we could tackle a lot more			0
it was never : @entity58 , this is hard , bloody hell , we need to review this			0
we never questioned it ; it was great			2
so we had that from the beginning ... ' early on in the couple 's relationship , @entity65 painted a similar picture , previously admitting to the @entity69 that they are both resigned to periods apart : ' well , that 's the job we do			1
we 'll always travel with work			2
@entity29 is great , and we 're getting on brilliantly			0
' it 's been actually quite easy because we 're both working			2
if i was n't working it would be a lot harder			0
' @entity5 eyes : @entity65 , who was born in @entity80 , starred opposite @entity81 in @entity82 of @entity83 and was nominated for both a @entity84 and a @entity85 for her performance so , who exactly is @entity3 and how did she successfully woo the man that is currently capturing millions of hearts while playing @entity93 legend captain @entity92 in the hit @entity95 series ? to date , the @entity80 - born actress is best known for playing opposite @entity97 star @entity81 in @entity98			1
@entity65 played the role of @entity100 in the play and trod the boards in the @entity104 production in 2013 before transferring to @entity105 the following year			1
it was a role that garnered plenty of praise from critics ; nominations for @entity111 and @entity85 followed			0
the actress is currently starring in @entity113 , a @entity116 - based @entity115 horror show about the cheap - to - buy , sensationalist books of the same name which were published in the 19th century			0
masterpiece ! @entity6 has admitted to using baby oil to make his body look perfect on screen although the @entity11 star has said he had to seriously hit the gym to perfectly hone his physique , the make - up department had another trick to ensure his body looked suitably granite - like for the hit @entity95 show			1
@entity6 says that some kind of ' baby oil ' was used to make his muscles ripple perfectly for the camera			1
and captain @entity92 's striking eyes might suggest @entity136 ' own peepers were enhanced with make - up but that 's not the case			2
he told the @entity34 that while he had to wear eyeliner for ' some scenes ' , he definitely does n't lush up his lashes with mascara			0
a role in the @entity147 - @entity5 television series @entity145 also raised the @entity5 beauty 's profile and it seems @entity150 now beckons too			1
later this year , the striking brunette is set to start work on a comedy , playing opposite @entity154 and @entity155			1
born in @entity80 , @entity65 trained in @entity116 , graduating from the @entity156 in 2006 after becoming obsessed with being an actress after going to watch a local panto			1
she said : ' my parents took myself and my sister to see the @entity164 panto @entity163 in the @entity165 and i was sold , all i wanted to do was get up on the stage ! ' the couple met after working together in the play @entity169 but it was a slow burn before a relationship developed			2
he told @entity172 in 2013 : ' i did a play with her about eight years ago @entity169 , directed by @entity175			2
' i played @entity178 , her character was n't a named character but we met on that			0
' it was all very platonic and we never hooked up or anything , but that 's how we got to know each other			2
and then years later we just met again and it just sort of took off			2
' his brooding good looks are n't always so refined either			0
the actor has confessed that he is ' inherently lazy ' and only really got in shape for @entity11 as filming start dates approached			2
' i worked hard for six weeks , killing myself in the gym , watching what i eat and staying away from bad food			0
but i would never , ever do all that if i was n't prepping for a role			0
that 's the only time it just happens , ' he explained			0
' i 'm not like that now			0
i 'm back to my usual soft self			0
' it has n't always been plain sailing on the love front either			0
speaking to the @entity206 about being hurt by a past girlfriend , the actor said : ' yes , it 's happened to me			1
i 've been upset , my heart 's been broken			1
' i do n't know anyone on the planet who has n't had their heart broken			0
' it 's the purest and rawest thing we have in life and everyone experiences it			0
' he may have found happiness with @entity65 , but talks of engagement are too hasty			1
last week , she told @entity5 entertainment websites and @entity225 and @entity226 while at an event in @entity116 : ' i 'm not engaged			1

@entity6 has been dating fellow actor @entity3 for four years
the @entity5 couple say they 've ' never questioned ' having to work apart
@entity65 won *plaudits* in @entity82 of @entity83 with @entity81
she 's set to star in a new comedy with @entity155 and @entity154
