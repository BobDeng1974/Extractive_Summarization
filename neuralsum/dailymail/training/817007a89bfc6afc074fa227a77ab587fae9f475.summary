she said : ' like every woman , i have a lot of body issues			1
i 'm really curvy , but i do n't really like my hips or love handles			0
' i 've got a really small waist - but there 's a 10 - 12 inch difference between my waist and my hips , which is huge			0
' @entity46 added to those insecurities : @entity7 put on three - and - a - half - stone when she was pregnant with daughter , @entity49 and struggled for years to get her figure back			1
to regain confidence , she had a breast enhancement			0
' when you are pregnant you can lose sight of who you are and , for me , getting a boob job was part of being me again			0
fluctuating : @entity7 explained that in the past her weight had yoyo - ed from anywhere between 9st 3lb at her heaviest to 8st 2lb at her lightest - she is finally happy with her current body ' my boobs had turned into empty sacks after my pregnancy , so i had them boosted from @entity64 to a @entity65 , ' she explained			1
but she was still left with what she calls a ' jelly belly			0
' she said : ' i was unhappy with how my stomach looked from having a baby – i had a bit of a jelly belly			0

' @entity7 has now hit her target weight thanks to her new exercise and healthy eating regime			1
she has been doing home workout sessions - quick 30 minute work - out sessions which combine squat thrusts , burpees , leg raises crunches and press ups			0
finally happy : @entity7 put on three - and - a - half - stone when she was pregnant with daughter , @entity49 - and struggled for years to get her figure back , but now , at 8st 2lbs , is happy with her body she will switch body parts on alternate days , so legs and abs monday , chest and arms wednesday , @entity92 and she takes the weekend off			1

holiday figure : @entity7 was targetted by online bullies who branded her ' fat ' in these @entity21 pictures her danger time , however , comes at around 4pm when she has cravings for snacks so her only option was to turn to diet pills to curb the cravings			1
she said : ' i 'm a snacker at heart so i 'll usually pick at anything that 's around me			0

' fans of the diet pills include @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145			1
@entity146 , a nutritionist who works with @entity145 , said : ' i think eating a wholefood diet is the most important thing			2
' adding supplements is great but if you still stuffing your face with pizza then you wo n't be able to be the healthiest version of you			0
insecure : the 26 - year - old entrepreneur has admitted that she had a range of ' body issues ' after failing to shift what she describes as her ' mummy tummy ' and ' unsightly love handles ' ' the problem with supplements is our body does n't recognise them as well , we absorb food best in its whole form			1
' @entity167 , nutritional therapist at @entity168 , added : ' raspberry ketones are a popular ingredient for weight loss – they are thought to work by increasing breakdown of fat ( lipolysis ) and the burning of fats for energy ( thermogenesis )			2
' one ingredient that may be more controversial in this product is caffeine : while it can stimulate the metabolism and assist weight loss in some individuals , it can be too stimulating for some people , causing or exacerbating anxiety and insomnia			2
' it is also thought that caffeine may exacerbate weight problems in some people , especially those who are " apple - shape "			2
