by @entity0 published : 20:38 est , 30 march 2013 updated : 20:38 est , 30 march 2013 a vicar has ordered @entity2 to quit the church headquarters they have used for 86 years – because they have failed to attend enough religious services			1

out of touch : reverend @entity7 at @entity12 in @entity13 has banned @entity2 after they failed to attend some services guide leader @entity25 , 42 , said the youngsters will hold their last meeting at the hall @entity29 said : ‘ we feel we have been treated unfairly			1
this is very sad after such a long and happy association with the church			2
‘ we have been told we simply were not attending enough services for us to continue using their hall			2
but i ca n’t press - gang the entire troop into going to church			2
‘ we have never been a scrap of trouble to the church – in fact our girls have happily helped prepare food for both the summer fair and @entity22 fair for more than 30 years			1
‘ i think the vicar is completely out of touch			1
half the girls are of a different faith and we also have a @entity48 youngster , so a high proportion of the group are not even @entity51			0
’ the group has used the hall as their base since 1927			0

off colour : the girl guides have been forced to find a new home mr @entity7 , the vicar of @entity61 ’s since 1998 , said he had asked the group to turn up for the four important church services a year			1

it is not the case that we have thrown them out			0
they have walked away from this standing agreement			1
it ’s sad that it has come to end like this			0
i really have no further comment to make			0
