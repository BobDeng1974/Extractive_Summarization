‘ the project idea comes from years of shooting			2
i have worked with an array of people , sitting for various situations from all walks of life			2
each person always had a story to tell which made them comfortable when sitting for the photo , ’ he explains			0
‘ so this led onto the idea that people when put into an uncomfortable situation always tend to reveal more than they would usually to relax themselves			2
‘ from that detail , i thought up the project and asked people to sit for a portrait but in turn they must tell me a secret that nobody else knows and the use of photo would help them release that secret to the public			1
@entity108 , 35 , reveals he gave up on a @entity109 in the history of poltergeist hauntings in the 17th and 18th centuries many of the secrets reveal inner pain , such as @entity116 , 43 , who says he tried to kill himself 25 years ago ‘ the secrets where so vast it was incredible to hear each and every one			2

the project follows the growing trend of telling , rather than repressing , our darkest innermost thoughts			2
@entity147 and the whisper app have both created a worldwide following on their ' secret sharing ' premises , with thousands combining art with revealing their secret , creating a sense of community artwork as well as lessening the feeling of solitude so many feel when holding onto a secret			0
@entity7 's project , of course , removes the anonymity that the other secret sharing projects grant , which is perhaps why it carries such an emotional weight for those who view the photographs .			1
