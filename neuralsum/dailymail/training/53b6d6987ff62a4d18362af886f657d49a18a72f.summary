@entity0 says it is an ‘ outrage ’ that he is banned from attending today ’s @entity3 ceremony , despite winning most votes in this year ’s @entity6 elections			1
traditionally , only the representatives of parties with at least six mps can attend the event			0
mr @entity0 is a @entity11 mp and although @entity12 has one mp – @entity14 defector @entity13 – that does not entitle @entity0 to join @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and leaders of a host of minor parties who will lay wreaths at the @entity3			1
some have a fraction of the 4.4 million votes won by @entity12 in the @entity11 elections , more than any other party			0
he was speaking moments after being photographed close to tears at the @entity39 ceramic poppy field			0
in an interview during which his mood swung from his trademark bravado and cheek to fury and less - familiar self - doubt , he : @entity0 , sporting @entity32 cufflinks , said he was ‘ provoked ’ into going to the poppy field by @entity49 newspaper which had attacked the ‘ toothless and fake ’ tribute			1
‘ they called it a “ @entity12 - style memorial ” and i was so bloody cross , i thought “ i ’m jolly well going there			2
” yes , the crowd did have a @entity12 feel – decent , patriotic @entity57 of every colour and creed			0
’ @entity0 ’s emotions about the @entity61 were stirred as a schoolboy when he learned how his grandfather @entity63 was injured in a @entity65 bomb ( early hand grenade ) raid in 1915 , with the @entity68 going to his grandad ’s comrade , @entity69			1
most of the 70 soldiers in the raid were killed or injured and @entity0 researched the heroics of @entity69 , who astonishingly lobbed 150 @entity65 bombs on his own			2
‘ they were so heavy they had to be bowled overarm like cricket balls , typically @entity78 , but damned dangerous			0
@entity69 had the @entity68 pinned on him by @entity79 at @entity80 , went back to the trenches and was killed weeks later			0
let the @entity49 sneer at that			2
’ the @entity12 leader , pictured here in @entity86 , admits he is ' not steady enough ' to be prime minister when @entity0 learned @entity91 ’s ‘ dead man ’s penny ’ ( a small memorial plaque issued to the next of kin of all those who died in the @entity61 ) was on sale , he bought it			1
i was n’t certain @entity0 would turn up			2
two days earlier , @entity33 ran two articles about him guaranteed to ignite his short fuse , one about alleged ex-mistress @entity99 , another about his seedy political marriage of convenience with a ragbag of @entity11 racists , neo-nazis and homophobes to get his hands on @entity11 grants			2
he forces me to put my pencil down to complain about the @entity99 story , with dark mutterings of legal issues			0
what does he say to those who say @entity12 is anti-immigrants and anti-black ? @entity0 barks : ‘ the most anti- black organisation i know is @entity118			1
they have destroyed the lives of tens of thousands of @entity120 with protectionist laws that make it impossible for them to sell produce to us			0
’ and his dodgy deals with racist @entity127 and @entity129 neo- nazis ? ‘ have you made a fuss over the @entity140 at the @entity141 having people who supported paedophilia , the @entity130 teaming up with a man with a conviction for racism or that @entity134 is in a group with screaming homophobes from @entity137 ? ’ little @entity145 ’s eyes nearly pop out with indignation ( @entity0 is said to be descended from @entity147 )			1
he says the @entity148 is close to being ‘ taken over ’ by the @entity149 but unlike @entity150 , they can never leave			1
‘ they have to back the @entity148 because it shows they are decent human beings after their nasty past			1
’ he expects more @entity14 mp defectors – and one @entity134 – but refuses to give names			0
he does n’t so much say the word ‘ @entity16 ’ as spit it on the floor			2
mr @entity0 believes prince @entity160 ( right ) should be the next @entity161 , not ' @entity162 , @entity163 ' @entity160 ‘ he has no chance of winning the election			1
he ’s beaten himself with windmills , more @entity6 , @entity168 taxes			1
’ while he regrets not being at the @entity3 , it will avoid a public spat with another posh boy he loathes – prince @entity172			2
arch global - warming sceptic @entity0 refused to join a standing ovation when @entity172 called for action to curb climate change in a speech to the @entity141			1
‘ it ’s a good job i ’m not having a brandy , or i ’d tell you what i really think , ’ he thunders			1
‘ he turned up to a foreign institution with far too much power over our country and told them they need more power to combat a problem that might not exist			0
if @entity171 had been right , the ice caps would have gone by now			0
‘ i sat there thinking , “ what is he on ? ” i ’m glad i refused to join the ovation			0
’ would @entity160 make a good @entity161 ? ‘ the younger generation are marvellous , ’ he says with a wink			1
@entity172 and give the crown to @entity160 ? ‘ judge for yourself			1
’ he turns it into a joke			0
‘ these days , @entity203 types vote @entity168 while the footmen , butler and kitchen maids vote @entity12			0
mind you , the @entity201 was more @entity12 than @entity12 ! ’ because she liked a drink ? ‘ @entity208 ! ’ how about the @entity209 and his ‘ slitty eyes @entity213 ’ - type gaffes ? ‘ yes , he ’d have to tone it down a bit to get in			1
’ but @entity217 bites his lip when asked about his own mum , @entity219 , who posed in the buff for a charity calendar			1
‘ i was a bit surprised , ’ is all he will say			2
perhaps he does n’t like the competition			0
blokes might like the idea of a beer with him , but his blazered golf club image is a turn - off to women and voters would run a million miles if he got anywhere near no 10			0
i braced myself for another @entity65 bomb			0
he more or less ran up the white flag			0
‘ perhaps they think the pm should be a @entity240 , ’ he reflected			1
‘ and maybe i ’m not a @entity240			2
i want to change things , but i ca n’t change who i am			0
