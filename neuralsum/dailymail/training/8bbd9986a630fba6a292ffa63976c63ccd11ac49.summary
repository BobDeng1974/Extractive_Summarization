the way neurons are interconnected in the brain is complicated			0
but now scientists have created a new type of computer model to make artificial networks of nerve cells found in the hippocampus region of the brain			1
the hippocampus helps us form personal memories , and it is hoped the tool will shed more light on how these memories develop as they move through the region 's different structures			1
scientists have created a new type of computer model to make artificial networks of nerve cells in the hippocampus part of the brain			1
a model of a rat 's hippocampus is pictured , with different colours denoting different regions			2
it is hoped the tool will shed more light on how the hippocampus forms memories scientists will also explore how the structure connects to the the brain , and which information arrives where and when , using models			1
the model has been created by dr @entity39 and his colleagues from the @entity41 in @entity42			2
dr @entity39 developed a method that allows the brain 's anatomic data and neurons to be reconstructed as a 3d model			0
once built , this 3d model can be manipulated on a computer			0
the hippocampus enables humans to navigate space securely and to form personal memories			1
the region is seahorse shaped and is shaded in red in this illustration researchers from the @entity41 in @entity42 , developed the method that means the brain can be constructed as a 3d model , and can be manipulated on a computer ( pictured )			1
structures that form a rat 's hippocampus , including @entity67 , @entity67 , subiculum and entorhinal cortex are pictured in blue , red , yellow and green the hippocampus is a major part of the brains of humans and other vertebrates			2
it is named after its resemblance to a seahorse , with hippos meaning horse in @entity83			0
it is located in the medial temporal lobe			0
the hippocampus belongs to the limbic system and plays important roles in the consolidation of information from the short - term memory to the long - term memory			2
rodents use the brain region for spatial memory and navigation			0
in alzheimer 's disease , the hippocampus is one of the first regions of the brain to be damaged , leading to memory loss and disorientation			1
they claim that their approach is unique because it enables automatic calculation of the neural interconnection based on their position inside the space			0
scientists can generate feasible network structures more easily than using other tools			0
they are using the models to monitor the way neural signals spread throughout the network time-wise , according to the study published in the journal frontiers in @entity119			1
dr @entity39 has , so far , found evidence that the hippocampus ' form and size could explain why neurons in those networks fire in certain frequencies			1
in future , this method may help us understand how animals , for example , combine various information to form memories within the hippocampus , in order to memorise food sources or dangers and to remember them in certain situations			1
the researchers have so far shown off a model of a rat â€™s hippocampus including its different layers such as the @entity67 and @entity67 regions , the subiculum and entorhinal cortex			0

neurons in a mouse hippocampus are pictured			0

scientists at the @entity41 creates the new models
it lets *experts* make artificial networks of nerve *endings* in the hippocampus - on a computer *screen* so they can explore how memories form
the hippocampus is thought to be one of the *oldest* regions of the brain
scientists are monitoring the way neural signals spread throughout the network time-wise using their new tool
in the *furure* they hope to show how animals memorise food and dangers
