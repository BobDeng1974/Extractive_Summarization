a map produced by @entity39 , part of @entity41 shows where all the sales have been in the last 18 years , and how the vast majority are in @entity14			2
it also reveals how rising property prices have spread out of the capital , reaching parts of the @entity49 , the @entity50 and the @entity51			2
@entity52 , head of research at @entity39 , said : ' with all this talk of @entity55 taxes the number one question on my lips was where are all these mansions ? ' our animated @entity62 clearly shows how @entity14 has been the key market for the £ 2m property over the last 18 years			2
over time though the once very rare £ 2million - plus sale has become more common			2
' there were still only 2,490 of them in @entity69 & @entity70 during 2013 versus almost 10,884 £ 1million - plus sales			1
' and they can now be seen in the super high end markets of @entity74 , @entity75 near @entity76 popular with footballers , and the @entity79 and @entity80 resorts			0
' the exclusive golf centred developments at @entity83 , @entity84 are clearly visible as is @entity86 home to the @entity88 training ground as well as some of its players			0
' @entity32 data shows a sharp rise in the number of homes selling for more than £ 1million , and almost 2,500 selling in 2013 for more than £ 2million under @entity7 's plans the mansion tax will cost about £ 250 a month for someone in a home worth between £ 2million and £ 3million			1
it is estimated that 108,000 homes – the vast majority in @entity14 and the @entity103 – will be caught by the tax			0
mr @entity19 's mansion tax plans came under fire from former pop singer @entity107 this week when she criticised the plan on television			1
the former @entity111 singer took the @entity7 leader to task in a heated tv debate and viewers praised her for ' doing a @entity116 ' and ' wiping the floor ' with him			1
she told mr @entity19 : ' for me , it 's so disturbing – the name in its own right : ' mansion tax '			1
' immediately you conjure up an image of these barbie-esque houses , but in @entity14 , which is where 80 per cent of the people who will be paying this tax actually live , have you seen what that amount of money can get you ? it 's like a garage			2
' when you do look at the people who will be suffering this tax , it 's true a lot of them are grannies who have had these houses in their families for a long , long time			0
' @entity19 was left humiliated on monday night after he was unceremoniously taken to task by @entity143 over @entity7 ’s proposed mansion tax on homes worth more than £ 2million in the @entity147 today @entity146 mocked mr @entity19 for getting a public ' pasting ' from @entity143			1
the @entity7 leader challenged the prime minister to back the policy at their weekly @entity147 face - off , complaining that the owner of a £ 140 million property in @entity155 would be paying the same as someone whose home was worth ' a fraction of that value '			1
but mr @entity146 took the opportunity to raise mr @entity19 's bruising encounter with the model and @entity111 singer this week , saying she had ' wiped the floor ' with him			2
mr @entity146 said the @entity166 had ' made sure that the richest in our country have made a contribution by putting up stamp duty '			0
' but the point about this is what we need is a growing economy that is providing the jobs , the livelihoods for our people , ' he said			0
' that is what we are getting			0
whereas what he has had in the past week is a pasting from a pop star			2
' he returned to the subject later in the exchanges , joking : ' this was the week when @entity107 wiped the floor with him in a television programme and this was the week when an opinion poll in @entity193 showed that more people believe in the @entity195 than believe in his leadership			0
' the only problem for the @entity7 is he does actually exist			0
' prime minister @entity146 today mocked @entity7 leader @entity19 over his ' pasting from a pop star ' as the two men went head to head in the @entity204 however , mr @entity19 did receive support from mr @entity146 's coalition partner , @entity207 leader @entity207			1
pointing out that all homes worth more than £ 700,000 currently pay the same council tax , the deputy prime minister told @entity211 his party had long wanted to introduce a mansion tax and @entity107 was ' wrong '			1
' she also suggested that all you can buy in @entity14 was a garage for £ 2 million			0
that 's some garage , ' he said			0
' let 's get rid of the emotion about calling it , claiming that one person 's normal home is a mansion			0
' why do n't we treat higher value properties in the same banded way of putting council tax bands as we do on lower value properties ? ' what is possibly fair about saying to a family who live in a family home in @entity231 that they pay the same council tax as an oligarch who lives in a £ 13m house ? '			0
