they were the club who openly neglected the cup competitions with a manager embarrassed by his record			2
now , however , @entity5 and @entity6 are two ties from @entity8 and are going all out for their first domestic trophy in 60 years			1
it was during a fans ’ forum meeting last season that club hierarchy upset supporters when they admitted that the @entity15 and @entity16 were not a priority			1
@entity6 vows to pick a strong team to face @entity19 in the @entity16 quarters on wednesday @entity5 are looking to bounce back after a 4 - 1 defeat by @entity22 on saturday after their win over @entity24 indeed , before this campaign @entity6 had never made it beyond the fourth round of either competition , a failure he conceded was ‘ embarrassing ’			1
on wednesday night , they face @entity19 at @entity32 in the @entity16 quarter - final with debate on @entity35 raging over which match – this or sunday ’s @entity37 – takes precedence			1
that the majority of supporters have sided with the chance of a first @entity8 appearance since 2000 and first piece of domestic silverware since the @entity15 in 1955 and their first trophy since the 1969 @entity47 , serves to highlight the significance of the trip to north @entity50			1
and that is not lost on @entity6			1
‘ it 's about grasping this opportunity , ’ said the former @entity53 midfielder , who was an @entity15 finalist in 1990			1
‘ i have played in quarter - finals before and there is just extra meaning to it			1
you are eight teams away			0
‘ it 's like going to the funfair , i guess			2
when you are young , you are really looking forward to it because it 's going to be exciting and that 's the sense you get – and there 's where we are			2
rookie keeper @entity68 is set to keep his spot with @entity70 and @entity71 still injured ‘ i can feel the squad bubbling under in terms of the excitement and looking forward to the two games			0
’ he added : ‘ look , the derby is a @entity78 game and an important one			2
we are all aware of that			0
it carries more significance in this area , and maybe in the football world because of the fixture 's history			2
‘ but a quarter - final of the @entity16 does n't come around too often for this club and there is a spring in the step			1
’ @entity6 ’s record in the @entity15 , in particular , has been a source of shame			1
@entity5 have lost to @entity94 , @entity95 ( twice ) and @entity96 during his four - year tenure			1
progression tonight , however , could represent payback to supporters who were so disgusted when a weakened team were beaten by @entity96 in january			0
to that end , @entity6 will be naming his strongest xi. ‘ this run has eased the embarrassment a little bit , ’ he said			1
‘ i do n't think it will take away the pain of @entity95 and @entity94 , and the @entity96 game which we should have won			2
that was such a disappointment and we carried that for a little while in our mood and personality			0
‘ i just hope that whatever happens that we put a performance on for our 4,000 fans			0
there are not many clubs who would go to @entity22 ( on saturday ) , come all the way back up , have a rest and then go back down to @entity50 again			0
@entity5 captain @entity124 is raised above boss @entity125 with the @entity15 in 1955 the 1955 @entity15 , brought home to @entity5 here , is the last time the club won domestic silverware ‘ i appreciate that and their support is important			1
’ he went on : ‘ we will be very strong ( in terms of selection )			0
‘ it 's an exciting few days for us , and this is what we are in football for			0
we have got ourselves here			0
we have now got this moment , so let 's grasp it			0
‘ i think this team may be more geared up for football than past ones , so that helps , but we have also played very well and the cup competition has been key to the turn - around in our season			0
‘ if we win this , we have got all the momentum we need going into the derby			0
it can work in our favour			0
