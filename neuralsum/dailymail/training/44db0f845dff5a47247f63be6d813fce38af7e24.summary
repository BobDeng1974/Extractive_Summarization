by @entity0 @entity1 , campaign manager for @entity2 when @entity4 became the subject of a @entity2 campaign last month , the world watched as a glamorous @entity8 icon became embroiled in the gritty debate on fathers ' rights			1
no place for an @entity15 - winning screen star , the 38 - year - old was unimpressed when the equal parenting group used her home life as the launch of their @entity20 ad campaign			1
the initiative , which attempts to stop women denying fathers access to their families , coincided with the birth of @entity4 's latest child - @entity27 - and followed comments she 'd made to fashion bible @entity29 , which said : ' none of this 50/50 time with the mums and dads – my children live with me ; that is it			1
' the advert , which ran in the @entity38 , criticised the @entity39 for her comments on shared parenting and re-ignited the debate on our country 's creaking custody courts			1
unsurprisingly , @entity4 - who also has a 13 - year - old daughter , @entity46 , from her first marriage to director @entity48 and a nine - year - old son , @entity49 , from her second marriage to @entity51 - objected to becoming a poster girl for sexist mothers , launching a legal threat against @entity2 along the way with high - power law firm @entity56			1
but , rather than finding angry men in @entity60 costumes at the helm , the kingpin was - perhaps surprisingly - a woman			2
@entity1 was the brains , the braun and the balls behind the controversial ad , which directly questioned a woman 's automatic , unquestioned power in family law			1
so the first question when we meet in @entity72 's @entity71 is perhaps an obvious one : why on earth would she want to swap sisterhood for a superhero suit ? after all , no matter how powerful women have become in recent years , the partnership remains an unlikely one			2
the answer , it seems , is simple			0
from 2002 to 2012 , @entity1 - a devoted mother - of - two - had her own devastating insight into what fathers experience on a regular basis			1
for ten years she endured 25 judges , 70 hearings , 54 criminal allegations , 45 court orders and over £ 120,000 in legal bills when a dispute with her ex-husband over residency of their daughter turned into a living nightmare			2
despite offering him shared residency and unlimited contact , the dispute continued for over a decade because her ex wanted sole custody at the exclusion of @entity1			1
during that time she lost her home , her job , her health and nearly her mind as she was driven to the edge of a breakdown			0
but , rather than becoming angry with men , she identified with them - and got angry with the system			2
@entity1 , left , was the brains behind the controversial @entity2 campaign which used @entity4 as their poster girl for shared parenting ' in 2005 , three years into my own battle , a girlfriend told me about @entity2			1
she said my story sounded like that of the men she 'd read about in the papers , so i went to a meeting with my @entity126 , ' she says			0
' i had second thoughts and very nearly did n't go because i was worried they 'd be hostile towards women , but i could n't have been more wrong			0
in fact , they saved me			0
' several years of activism followed - including interrupting a live @entity134 broadcast of the @entity135 - but fast - forward to the present day and @entity1 , who is fashionable and funny as well as fantastically formidable , is now the organisation 's campaign manager : uniting men who , ironically , have been disenfranchised by women			1
@entity4 , pregnant with her third baby , @entity27 , in october , has three children by three different men specifically , between 2010 - 12 , she led negotiations with both the conservatives and @entity147 on family law reform			1
but how did such an unlikely relationship blossom ? ' i came to @entity150 for help because there were no women ’s groups who could support me in the same way , ' she adds , matter - of - factly			2
' had they been hostile or campaigning to take power away from women then i would n't have got involved			0
but @entity2 have never done that			1
they simply ask that fathers be given the same power as women			2
' this message , she says , formed an integral part of her recent work with ' the @entity4 campaign ' because , socially and legally , it remains off - limits			1
even in the upper echelons of @entity171			0
but @entity1 's criticisms are n't just reserved for @entity4			1
@entity173 , @entity174 and @entity175 are all next in line for a new set of adverts which are expected to run in national newspapers , next month			1
meanwhile , rumours are abound that @entity181 is also on their hit list while another @entity4 ad , featuring comments by her ex @entity48 - who previously spoke out in defence of @entity2 - is currently in production and threatens to continue the furore			1
' @entity4 still needs to retract her comments and make a statement supporting 50/50 shared parenting			1
that 's all we ever wanted , ' @entity1 says , passionately			1
' and we 'll continue until she does '			0
clearly , as her attitude to @entity8 's leading ladies may indicate , @entity1 has no concerns about impressing her fellow females simply because they share the same xx chromosomes			1
' the only reactions from women that i need to validate what i do are those of my daughter , my mother and my closest female friends who all completely understand the importance of the campaign , ' she says			2
part of that , she confesses , includes questioning and rejecting modern feminism			0
' @entity212 said feminism was trade unionism for women and i agree with that			0
instead , i believe in equality for both sexes			0
neither gender should pursue equality at the expense of the other			0
' over the last 20 years the original feminist movement has been hijacked by radical feminism and this has profoundly damaged women 's campaign for equality , of which there are still areas that needs addressing			2
any kind of ‘ ism ’ is generally bad news and feminism has become a form of extremism , especially with the anti-father ideology they support			0
' if people think that 's controversial perhaps they should ask themselves why			2
' @entity4 and her third husband @entity239 at an event in @entity241 in december 2012 that said , this woman on a mission bristles at the suggestion that what she is doing is actually harming women 's liberation			1
she claims the opposite is true			0
' i spend much of my working day supporting women , mothers , grandmothers and sisters to help them see their children , grandchildren and nephews and nieces , ' she asserts			2
' unlike the law , i do n’t discriminate on the basis of gender			0
' this aside , she admits that being a woman in her role certainly has some advantages			0
' it should be irrelevant that i am a woman doing this job , but i would be wrong pretending it does not have an effect on how some people view the campaign			0
' one third of @entity2 ’s registered supporters are women and we have only ever had women run the @entity2 campaign office			1
the most important effect of having a woman running @entity2 is that it helps people understand family breakdown and contact denial can happen to anyone , mother or father			1
' compellingly , the facts speak for themselves			0
according to @entity286 , one in three youngsters now have no access to their father - which equates to almost four million @entity293 children nationwide			1
this is n't because men are feckless fathers - although , admittedly , countless are - but because around 200 men are denied access to their children by secret family law courts every single day			1
adding insult to injury , these men have no robust legal rights to see their offspring , despite being forced to pay for them via the @entity305			2
@entity4 with her second husband , film director @entity51 , to whom she was married between 2003 and 2010 ironically , at a time when feminists are campaigning for women to appear on @entity293 bank notes ( even though they already feature @entity315 ) men frequently spend tens of thousands of pounds to obtain court orders that are n't worth the paper they 're written on			1
meanwhile , grandparents do n't fare any better either			0
which , @entity1 says , is another reason why her work is as relevant as ever			2
' @entity2 is even more important today than it was back in 2001 because society has become so engrained with the anti-father rhetoric that children are growing up with a warped sense of self - worth and family , ' adds @entity1 , who confesses particular concern for her own son			1
in fact , she has a stark message for all men and boys : stay single and childless			0
' do n’t do it			0
do n’t get married and do n’t have children			2
as it stands you have no rights whatsoever and statistically being a father does not have a happy ending - you will be reduced to the status of a sperm bank and a cashpoint			0
' everyone knows somebody touched by the cancer of family breakdown			0
we are only looking for a cure			0
even if they are happily in a relationship and not facing family breakdown , if they have children , especially if they have a son , then statistically they could be the next person who calls our campaign group			2
' so what needs to change in order for everyone to benefit from equal parenting ? a massive , time - consuming , expensive overhaul of the legal profession and governmental child care agencies ? perhaps not			1
' it 's very simple , ' she says			0
' in fact , it may be too simple for the government to comprehend			0
all they need to do is change the law to give both parents equal rights and to make the starting point 50/50			0
' if a woman feels uncomfortable with me doing that then it says more about her than it does about me			0

mother - of - three @entity4 , 38 , was used in @entity2 's @entity20 advert
