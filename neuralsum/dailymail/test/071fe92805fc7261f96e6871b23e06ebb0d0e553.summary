whether it 's from a university or a new employer , we all know that horrible , deflated feeling that comes with getting a rejection letter			1
but 17 - year - old @entity6 hit back after being sent a rejection letter from @entity8 , by sending the admissions office a message of her own , rejecting their rejection			1
the teenager , from @entity13 , had applied to the prestigious college in her home state , but on march 26 she was sent a letter telling her she had failed to make the grade			2
mirroring the standard format of college rejection letters , she added : ' despite @entity8 's outstanding success in rejecting previous applicants , you simply did not meet my qualifications			1
' therefore , i will be attending @entity8 's 2015 freshmen class			1
i look forward to seeing you then			0
' speaking to @entity42 about the letter , she said : ' they sent me a typical college rejection letter , " this year we had an outstanding pool of applicants ... " , blah , blah , blah			1
' it made me realize how much power universities have over students			0
seniors labor over applications , stress over waiting , and sometimes cry over the answer			0
' the college has all the power			0
but what if that was n't it ? what if we got to treat the college like they treated us ? i wanted to give them a taste of their own medicine			2
' miss @entity6 's letter has attracted nearly 100,000 likes and rebolgs since she posted it to her @entity73 account , and will even feature in @entity8 's college newspaper since posting a copy of the letter to her @entity73 account , the image has gone viral , attracting nearly 100,000 likes and reblogs since first being posted			1
speaking about the popularity of the email , she said : ' i obviously was n't expecting it to get this popular , it was just meant as a joke			2
' my friends all it 's hilarious , i have n't showed my mom yet but she 'll get a good laugh out of it			2
' my only regret is not proof reading it first as a few people have pointed out the bad grammar			0
' not sharing the joke : @entity8 did respond to @entity97 's email , but clearly did n't share her sense of humour , instead telling her she could appeal their decision , but was unlikely to get it overturned while @entity97 's letter did n't earn her a place at @entity8 , it seems to have got the attention of students on campus , and is even set to feature in the college newspaper			1
@entity8 did eventually respond to her rejection letter , but did n't appear to share the joke , instead telling her that should could appeal their decision , but ' it 's very rare ' for the call to be overturned			1
however @entity97 , who also goes by her middle name of @entity119 , has no need for an appeal after being awarded a place at the @entity123			0
she said : ' i 'm going to major in biology and minor in mathematics			0
my goal is to be a pediatrician			0
i look forward to going to @entity123 this fall			0

@entity6 , 17 , had been *hoping* to get a place at @entity8
when she got a rejection email she decided not to take no for an answer
sent college email of her own , saying she could n't accept their rejection
message has gone viral and will even feature in @entity8 's campus paper
