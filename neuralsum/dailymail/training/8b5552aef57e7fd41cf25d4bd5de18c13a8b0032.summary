and so to match 64 , or the @entity0 as you and i call it			1
and the two teams are rested , recuperated , and ready for ‘ the big one ’			0
no , not the superstars of @entity6 and @entity7 , but the @entity9 and @entity10 @entity0 line - ups chosen and charged up for the occasion			1
in times past , any tactic would be used to get an edge , but now there is a reality check			0
however a very keen professional rivalry still exists			0
this is tv sport business with a capital @entity36 so here goes : @entity38 : @entity9 : @entity24 starred as an @entity40 player in the two tournaments that climaxed in the previous @entity6 v @entity7 @entity43 , heavyweight credibility			1
the @entity9 host starts airborne with a filmed panoramic flight over @entity47 but when the programme ‘ lands ’ in the studio he is seriously suited and fluted			1
landing : @entity24 was seen over @entity47 in casual wear at the start but looked smart in a suit in the studio final countdown : @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity18 in the studio @entity10 : @entity61 seems happy to work on a ‘ brilliant ’ @entity0 in @entity62 and has backed it up daily by wearing smiles and shorts			1
it ’s still beachside but he opts for full length trousers			1
' @entity69 has been our home since day one and we are going to finish where we started , ' he says			0
@entity73 / @entity72 : @entity9 : @entity59 , @entity58 , @entity57 , like @entity24 , are sharp - suited			1
@entity57 , an outstanding new addition to football punditry , underlines he has enjoyed being a member of the @entity9 team and seeing a @entity0 from a different perspective			1
and with the @entity9 , he ’ll realise , in due course , you always win the @entity0			1
beach boys : @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity61 , @entity84 and @entity85 interesting : @entity85 's hair was battered by the wind but his analysis was spot on for @entity10 @entity10 : @entity84 , @entity83 , @entity85 and @entity82 , like @entity61 , sport long trousers and spill out their theories			1
@entity85 and @entity82 have been @entity10 ’s outstanding experts and that is still the case tonight			1
@entity85 is sharp on tactics , while @entity82 is entertainingly forthright including memorably getting @entity96 into the big game 's match analysis			2
stadium presenters / experts : @entity9 : @entity101 , a group stage star for the @entity9 is in the @entity102 thinks @entity103 will play a big part in the @entity0 and that while @entity6 face their toughest match they should win			1
strike a pose : @entity107 was able to recall his memories as a @entity0 winning captain eight years ago @entity10 : on the other side , @entity107 has marveled at the magic of @entity112 , but as a @entity0 - winning captain , he gets personal : ‘ today brings back memories , very good memories ’			1
the match : it ’s @entity118 ’s second @entity0 for the @entity9 , @entity116 has fought off tough opposition to retain his place , probably on the basis he ’ll concentrate more on the quality of the football than the quips			1
both @entity118 and @entity125 , @entity10 ’s man up front , deal with @entity6 ’s late change , @entity127 out , @entity128 in			2
@entity129 scores for @entity7 but it is offside			0
both @entity118 and @entity125 catch it quickly			0
@entity10 ’s @entity85 says at half time that ‘ @entity7 need to get @entity103 in the game more ’			2
and it nearly happens two minutes after the break , @entity103 misses – unbelievably			0
‘ of all the players ’ , @entity116 says what we are all thinking			0
extra time : the tired players reach a mid-extra time break and @entity59 puts it straight on the line			0
whatever the tiredness … : ‘ this is 15 minutes which could define your life			0
’ and then it happens – @entity148 scores with a ‘ sensational finish ’ , ‘ a symbolic goal scored by one of the new batch of great @entity153 ’ , @entity116 and @entity118 respectively			0
at the final whistle @entity10 ’s @entity125 sums up the achievement of the new world - beaters : ‘ it ’s @entity6 ’s time again			2
the first @entity159 winners in @entity160			0
the reality is that @entity6 are champions of the football world			0
’ but let us leave the last word with the retiring @entity59 : ' it ’s a great way to go , ’ he says			0
the @entity0 here has been sublime			2
and the goal that won the @entity0 was extra-special			2
' champions : @entity6 , alongside the @entity9 , were the big winners on the biggest footballing night			2

@entity24 's *helicopter* ' entrance ' was *impressive*
@entity9 *inevitably* win the ratings battle , but @entity10 make good *revenue*
@entity61 moves to full length trousers but keeps smiling on the beach
both channels showed the best of their @entity0 efforts
