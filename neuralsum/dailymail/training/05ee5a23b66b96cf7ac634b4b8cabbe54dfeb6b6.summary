a ‘ very unusual ’ carving , which is thought to be of arachnids , was found on the west wall of a sandstone valley in the @entity11 in @entity12			1
it is thought to have been carved in 4,000 bc by prehistoric man , although the identification of the lines as spiders is rather tentative and no one is sure why they were drawn			1
the rock panel , which is now in two pieces , is said to show a few spiders and a web ( next to the spider on the far left ) as well as extra enigmatic lines that could be insects trapped by the spiders , plants or tubes of silk , professor @entity20 said the panel , discovered in the desert some 108 miles ( 175km ) west of @entity33 , is positioned to be illuminated by the morning sun. egyptologist @entity20 , a professor at the @entity35 who is also co-director of the @entity36 , told @entity37 the find is ‘ very unusual ’			1

interestingly , a piece of rock broken off of the main panel shows what could be a harvestman insect , which is drawn in a different style to the other ‘ spiders ’			1
the panel was discovered in the desert some 108 miles ( 175km ) west of @entity33 is positioned to be illuminated by the morning sun. it is thought to have been carved in 4,000 bc by prehistoric man while archaeologists are excited by the discovery , they are also baffled as no other examples of this kind have ever been found in @entity12 or anywhere else in the world			1
spiders are also rarely depicted in ancient @entity12 carvings , adding to the mystery			2
the only hieroglyphs showing spiders are from religious texts depicting the ‘ opening of the mouth ’ ritual , which was performed on a mummy to restore its senses for use in the afterlife , according to professor @entity20			0
archaeologists believe the spiders perhaps held religious significance to prehistoric people			0
@entity89 said @entity91 spiders that live in the western and eastern deserts of the country and bask in the sun in the middle of their orb webs , could have been the inspiration for the ancient artwork and have religious meaning to people			0
@entity89 said @entity90 ( pictured ) that live in the western and eastern deserts of the country and bask in the sun in the middle of their orb webs , could have been the inspiration for the ancient artwork and have religious meaning to people writing in the @entity41 article , she said : ‘ this would combine the force of the sun and the ability of this solar creature to survive its heat successfully , and thus be worthy of reverence or totemic allegiance			0
’ there is one theory that the artwork might have acted as a warning as some spiders are known to bite people , which would have threatened prehistoric people			0
of course , someone might just have liked spiders and carved images of them in a rock without intending it to have a meaning , professor @entity20 said .			0
