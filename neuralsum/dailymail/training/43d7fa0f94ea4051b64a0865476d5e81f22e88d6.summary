as a billionaire playboy , @entity0 revels in his reputation as one of @entity5 ’s most ­ eligible and wealthy bachelors			1
he can certainly boast of ­ having had romances with some of the most beautiful women in the world			2
but what the businessman — who has a ­ sprawling home in @entity11 — should ­ perhaps be less proud of is that he made much of his vast fortune by exploiting the poorest and most ­ vulnerable people in the country			2
today , a @entity17 investigation can reveal that he is the king of the fixed - odds betting terminals that have brought such misery to so many — the so - called crack cocaine of the gambling world			1
@entity0 ’s company , @entity23 , is behind the ­ majority of software used by @entity27 ­ bookmakers where people , often from the most deprived areas , pump billions of pounds a year into the machines			1
supermodel and the gambling king : @entity33 with @entity0 @entity34 alone took £ 1 billion on the terminals in just one month as punters addicted to the ‘ games ’ — which typically ­ simulate roulette — wagered up to £ 100 every 20 seconds on a single spin			1
as the @entity17 revealed yesterday , a new poll shows nearly half of all voters believe the terminals should be banned , while 73 per cent want the maximum bet of £ 100 dramatically reduced			1
this pernicious presence in ­ hundreds of @entity45 is a direct result of @entity47 relaxing gambling regulations in 2001 , which opened the floodgates for ­ digital roulette games to be played in betting shops			2
since then the number of fixed - odds machines has rocketed to 33,000 — with @entity23 providing the technology for more than 20,000 of them			1
they have been blamed for an increase in problem gambling , and are said to have an almost hypnotic effect that leaves players like ‘ zombies ’			2
@entity62 , from @entity63 , @entity64 , blames his addiction to these machines for him losing his six - figure salary job as a business development manager in @entity69 , as well as the collapse of his marriage			2
he ended up amassing £ 60,000 of debts , which he kept secret from his wife			2
at one point he was sleeping on a park bench			0
‘ you can try for a new “ high ” every 20 seconds , but then you find you are losing huge sums of money , ’ he says			0
‘ at its worst , i probably lost a month ’s salary in a couple of hours			2
’ this , then , can be the human cost of the betting machines — yet still @entity0 ’s company @entity87 unashamedly states its software can help book ­ makers ‘ manage your players ­ throughout the player ’s life - cycle ’ , describing how a gambler can play on a machine in a betting shop , and then ‘ when he is ready to move on , he can continue the game on his smartphone and tablet device in the comfort of his own home ’			1
while it is bad enough that @entity0 has helped turn @entity5 into a nation of gamblers , even more ­ disturbing is the fact that he learned some of the tricks of his controversial trade from the world of internet pornography			1
a fixed odds betting terminal , which are often found in @entity27 bookmakers not only that , i have established he is a convicted criminal who comes from a family with a murderous past			1
born in @entity119 in 1972 , @entity0 became accustomed to the finer things in life			1
his father ran a travel agency and his parents appeared in newspaper ­ gossip columns			0
but he and his ­ family were to find far greater notoriety for their criminal activities			0
in 1983 , @entity132 ’s older stepbrother , @entity131 , was convicted of the ­ murder of an investment consultant			0
there was little doubt about his guilt — he stole his father ’s gun , fitted a silencer and fired ten bullets at his victim after a disagreement believed to be about money			0
then in 1994 , when @entity0 was just 22 , he was arrested along with seven other businessmen on suspicion of insider trading			1
they were charged with buying and then manipulating the value of stock in a widespread banking fraud			0
@entity0 , one of the youngest among those arrested , admitted grave deceit , bribery and insider trading			1
he was jailed for nine months			0
when he was released , he became hellbent on making his fortune			0
he teamed up with his father trading on the stock market and buying and selling property			0
but he realised the internet was the means to make large sums , regardless of the ­ morality of how the money is made			0
as he said in one of his few public statements , ‘ sex and betting are the most profitable businesses on the internet ’			2
@entity132 invested in companies building pornographic websites			0
he was also eager to seek out those at the forefront of developing software			2
in 1999 , he invested in a company called @entity175 , which was involved in setting up ­ pornographic sites			2
that same year , he launched @entity23 in a bid to become the ­ biggest online gambling ­ software developer			1
he sought out the brightest mathematicians and ­ specialists who could develop games that would maximise profits			0
just seven years later , the ­ company was valued at £ 550 million when it floated on the @entity185			1
still in his early 30s , @entity0 had joined the ranks of the world ’s super-rich			1
@entity34 alone took £ 1billion on betting terminals in just one month ( file picture ) since then , the company has gone from strength to strength — two years ago its share price was 312p , but by last month it had soared to 814p			1
@entity132 announced recently that he will sell a 15.4 per cent stake in his company , giving him a payout of £ 326 million			1
today , he is estimated to be worth more than £ 1 billion , much of it from his licensing deals for ­ gambling software with the likes of @entity203 and @entity34			1
while @entity0 does not directly take a cut from gamblers pumping money into the betting machines , he is believed to have considerable financial interests in a number of @entity27 bookmakers			1
he certainly knows the importance of ­ hiring the best computer geeks to develop his software			2
crucially , fixed - odds betting ­ terminals are said to be addictive because they tempt the player back with just the right level of rewards			1
while a gambler may start off ­ winning , the odds are likely to be against him in the long term			2
also , if someone goes to a casino to play roulette , a single bet can take a few minutes to complete : on a ­ roulette game in a @entity27 ­ bookies , it ’s over in just 20 seconds			1
professor @entity229 , a specialist in the way technology is being harnessed by gambling firms , believes the machines made by the likes of @entity132 are ‘ odious ’ and should be banned			0
@entity0 was photographed arm in arm with supermodel @entity33 , pictured in 2009 ‘ the software in these machines taps into a fundamental part of human psychology , exploiting ­ people for maximum profit , ’ says the @entity240 academic and author of a book called @entity239			1
‘ essentially , people playing them are being manipulated by mathematicians who have worked out how to up the ante and keep you gambling , with just the right level of reward - to - risk ratio			2
‘ sophisticated digital technology and ­ mathematics are used to match the way the human brain and our ­ psychology work			0
’ @entity47 mp @entity259 says : ‘ these machines have turned every @entity27 into a digital casino			1
they are a menace to communities up and down the country			0
’ while fixed - odds betting ­ terminals have brought financial havoc to many lives , @entity0 has lived high on the profits of his enterprises			1
unlike the users of his games , @entity132 has received excellent returns on his penchant for risk			0
­ according to one @entity279 newspaper , he ‘ likes risk as much as he likes the good life ’			0
pressure has increased on the government to take some kind of action to curb the use of betting terminals ( file picture ) as well as that luxury home in @entity69 , he has properties in @entity290 , @entity291 , @entity292 and the @entity240 , and recently splashed out on a @entity294 luxury private jet			1
when i visited his home in @entity11 this week to request an interview , i was told by security staff at the heavily guarded ­ complex that @entity0 was a ‘ very busy and very ­ private man ’ and was probably away			1
he did not respond to a letter inviting him to talk to me , nor did his public relations ­ representatives return my calls			0
but he has not been quite so shy when it has come to pursuing some of the world ’s most beautiful women			0
in 2009 , he made gossip columns around the world when he was ­ photographed arm in arm with the @entity279 supermodel @entity33 , who had just split up with the @entity313 star @entity312			1
that same year , the couple posed for photographs at an after - show party when he took her to @entity291 to watch a concert by @entity319			2
there were also rumours that he was dating @entity321 , a model who has regularly appeared in a swimsuit in @entity325			0
he had a child , now eight , with a former beauty queen , and is now seeing a former @entity292 , with whom he ’s had a ­ second child			0
but the couple have not ­ married and @entity132 still gets listed in the media as one of the most ­ eligible bachelors around			0
according to one associate , he revels in his wealth			0
‘ he likes to have fun			0
he likes the good life			0
he takes long holidays and likes to spend his leisure time ­ watching football or films			0
he enjoys playing the piano and ping pong			0
’ recently , @entity132 raised his profile further in @entity5 with the purchase of @entity69 ’s iconic @entity346 for £ 400 million			2
whether gambling machines will continue to be such a cash cow for him remains to be seen , as pressure increases on the government to take some kind of action to curb their use			0
but then , thanks to gambling , @entity0 has already played the odds — and is a very big winner indeed .			1
