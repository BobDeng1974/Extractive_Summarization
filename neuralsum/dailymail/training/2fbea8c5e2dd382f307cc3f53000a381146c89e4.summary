striker @entity0 intends to make up for lost time after finally ending his ' annoying ' spell on the sidelines with a late cameo in @entity5 's goalless draw against @entity6			1
the 25 - year - old made his first appearance of the new season on saturday when introduced as a substitute at the start of four minutes ' stoppage time at the @entity13 - and almost snatched victory with a close - range header which was somehow clawed away by inspired @entity6 keeper @entity16			1
@entity0 , signed by the @entity17 in a club - record £ 15million deal from @entity20 in june 2013 , admits it was frustrating having to carefully manage his rehabilitation after ankle surgery , and now has regaining a regular starting place firmly in his sights			1
@entity0 's ( above ) return was the highlight for @entity5 in their 0 - 0 draw at home to @entity6 striker @entity0 replaced midfielder @entity32 at @entity13 in his comeback from torn ankle ligaments ' it is a great feeling to be back out on the pitch			1
it took a long time , a lot of hard work and i have to give credit to all of the medical staff for getting me back fit , ' he said			2
' i had to make sure it was 100 percent before i started doing anything			2
i had a couple of weeks where i could not do anything , even go to the gym			0
' with me being ( an ) active ( person ) , that was more annoying than anything			0
' ( after i came on ) i had a couple of chances and was unlucky with the one when the keeper made a great save			0
' now i am back with my first bit of football , so going forwards i am going to be champing at the bit			0
' @entity5 , who had beaten defending champions @entity59 in their last home game , dominated for long spells , but found a well - organised @entity6 side , looking to end a six - match losing streak , difficult to break down			1
@entity0 was denied twice late in the game by @entity6 goalkeeper @entity16 , as the match finished goalless when the visitors were opened up , @entity67 goalkeeper @entity16 was in good form , saving from both @entity70 and @entity71 during the first half			1
the usually reliable @entity74 striker @entity73 , fit again after a shoulder problem , dropped a header wide before the @entity17 went more direct during the closing stages , with @entity0 causing mayhem in the @entity6 penalty box , only to be denied by a brilliant reflex stop from @entity16			1
even though @entity6 - without suspended @entity82 forward @entity83 - were under pressure for long spells , they still provided a threat themselves on the counter			0
@entity0 will look to forge a strike partnership with @entity73 , who was named october 's player of the month @entity90 and @entity91 both had chances to break the deadlock			2
@entity6 boss @entity94 praised his side for the way they stood up to the physical challenge and hopes they can use the result as a platform for more positive results			0
' we are not the biggest of teams , but they put their bodies on the line , ' he said			0
' we have had an horrendous run of fixtures , that has made it tough , hopefully now we can pick things up			0
