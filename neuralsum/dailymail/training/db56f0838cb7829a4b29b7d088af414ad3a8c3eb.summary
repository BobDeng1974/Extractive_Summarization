doctors can now diagnose extremely rare genetic conditions simply using a family photo			1
this is thanks to computer software that can diagnose rare genetic diseases from snaps in just a few hours			1
the software , developed at the universities of @entity9 and @entity10 , scans ordinary photographs of patients ’ faces using facial recognition technology - similar to that used by @entity15			1
many genetic conditions are associated with changes in facial appearance			1
image above shows the typical distinct facial features of people with the following conditions ( top @entity23 ) : angelman syndrome , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 ( bottom @entity28 ) @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity35 - @entity34 syndrome this builds a description of the structure of the face by identifying corners of eyes , the nose , the mouth and other features			1
many genetic conditions such as @entity27 ’s syndrome and angelman syndrome are associated with changes in facial appearance			1
these occur because of the large number of genes that are involved in the development of the face and skull as a baby grows in the womb			0
scanning photos of different individuals who have the same genetic condition can identify distinctive facial traits that are associated with that particular disorder			1
the approach works even in very rare disorders that affect only a few people in the world			1
while genetic disorders are each individually rare , collectively these conditions are thought to affect one person in 17			1
of these , a third may have symptoms that greatly reduce quality of life			0
however , most people fail to receive a genetic diagnosis			2
genetic disorders are each individually rare , but collectively these conditions affect one person in 17			1
( image shows a dna molecule ) lead researcher dr @entity79 , of the @entity80 at the @entity10 , said : ‘ a diagnosis of a rare genetic disorder can be a very important step			2
' it can provide parents with some certainty and help with genetic counselling on risks for other children or how likely a condition is to be passed on			0
' he added : ' a diagnosis can also improve estimates of how the disease might progress , or show which symptoms are caused by the genetic disorder and which are caused by other clinical issues that can be treated			0
’ the team who developed the app say doctors should one day be able to take a smartphone picture of a patient and run the computer analysis to quickly find out which genetic disorder the person might have			2
this will be particularly helpful in countries without easy access to genetic tests			0
the programme itself was developed by software engineers at @entity10			1
experts from the @entity115 at @entity9 then provided guidance on the clinical images used to develop the software			2
professor @entity119 , of the institute , said : ' thousands of babies are born each year in the @entity122 with errors in their genetic makeup which mean that they do not develop normally			0
' getting to a firm diagnosis as quickly as possible is very important but the extremely large number of possible disorders makes this very challenging			0
' this technology will help doctors to pick up extremely rare disorders and may be able to identify new conditions			1
' it brings hope to those families living without a diagnosis and the prospect of information and tailored support to help them face the future			0
' the findings are reported in the journal @entity142			0
@entity143 this affects the nervous system , causing severe physical and intellectual disability , with symptoms becoming noticeable from early childhood			0
many children with @entity143 syndrome will have an abnormally small head by the age of two			0
some will also have the following features : a flattened skull at the back ; a tendency to stick out the tongue ; a prominent chin ; a wide mouth and wide - spaced teeth			2
@entity161 apert syndrome is a genetic disorder where some of the skull bones fuse prematurely			2
this in turn affects the shape of the head and face			0
the head is unable to grow normally , which leads to a sunken appearance in the middle of the face , bulging and wide - set eyes , a beaked nose , and an underdeveloped upper jaw leading to crowded teeth and other dental problems			1
shallow eye sockets can cause vision problems			0
@entity26 this is a a developmental disorder that causes , among other things , slow growth before and after birth and distinctive facial features			1
the facial differences include arched eyebrows that often grow together in the middle ; long eyelashes ; low - set ears ; small , widely spaced teeth ; a small , upturned nose			2
@entity27 's syndrome this genetic condition typically causes some level of learning disability and a range of physical features including : a small nose and flat nasal bridge ; a small mouth ; eyes that slant upwards and outwards			1
@entity30 @entity30 is the most common known cause of inherited learning disability , affecting one in 4,000 boys and one in 6,000 girls			0
physical features may include large ears and a long face			0
@entity31 an extremely rare genetic disease of childhood characterized by dramatic , premature aging			2
those with it develop a distinctive appearance : baldness ; aged - looking skin ; a pinched nose ; a small face and jaw relative to head size			1
@entity32 this affects the development of bones and other tissues of the face			0
most people with it have underdeveloped facial bones - cheek bones in particular - and a very small chin and jaw			0
@entity35 - @entity233 a development disorder that often causes learning problems and anxiety			0
distinctive facial features include a broad forehead , short nose with a broad tip , full cheeks , wide mouth with full lip .			1

many genetic conditions such as @entity27 's syndrome , @entity30 and @entity31 are associated a distinct facial appearance
new software uses facial recognition technology to scan photos of faces from regular family snaps
it then builds a description of the structure of the face from various features such as corner of eyes , nose , mouth
scanning photos helps identify distinctive facial traits of associated with particular conditions
software , developed by @entity10 and @entity9 *scientists* , can identify disorders that affect only a *handful* of people
