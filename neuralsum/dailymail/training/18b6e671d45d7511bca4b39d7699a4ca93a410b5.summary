captain fantastic : @entity1 has been named in @entity3 team for their @entity5 final vs @entity6 scare : @entity1 ( centre ) injured himself during @entity3 ' @entity12 semi-final win vs @entity21 in the zone : @entity3 fly - half @entity23 practices his place - kicking during their training session on friday eyes on the prize : @entity23 is looking to win his first @entity5 in saturday 's final against @entity6 pass master : @entity30 international @entity23 will face @entity32 winner @entity31 in a fly - half battle ready for action : @entity23 faces successive finals with the @entity12 showpiece vs @entity37 on may 31 but @entity3 confirmed in a team announcement on friday that he will line up in his familiar second - row position when they bid to become the fifth @entity42 @entity41 champions after @entity43 , @entity37 , @entity44 and @entity45			1
former @entity30 skipper @entity1 will retire at the end of this season , with @entity3 having two games left - the @entity5 final and an @entity12 final showdown with @entity37 at @entity51 in eight days ’ time			2
