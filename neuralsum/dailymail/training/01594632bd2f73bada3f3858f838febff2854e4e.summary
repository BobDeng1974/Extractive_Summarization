he also installed cameras in two private homes			0
a total of 31 children at the 1,300 - strong school aged between 11 and 16 were captured on camera			1
at his sentencing in may , prosecutor @entity34 said : ' this was a serious systematic abuse of trust - a devious and determined invasion of privacy of the children			0
' the effect on children , staff and parents was one of complete and utter disbelief			0
' today , three judges at the @entity48 in @entity49 upheld a sentence challenge by @entity6 , saying his jail term was ' manifestly excessive ' and cutting it to four years			1
mr @entity51 said @entity6 , of @entity52 , @entity8 , installed the recording devices to get photos of boys for his ' obsessive ' gratification			1

in may judge @entity99 branded @entity6 ' depraved ' , telling him his crimes were a ' dreadful and protracted breach of trust '			2
on appeal today , his defence barrister @entity102 argued that the sentence was ' simply too long ' , especially given his mitigation			2
@entity6 had worked as the deputy headteacher at @entity7 in @entity8 ( pictured ) the barrister said the extensive cataloguing of the voyeurism images by age supported @entity6 ' claim that he was , at least in part , interested in children 's physical development			1

mr @entity51 , sitting with sir @entity117 and mr @entity118 , said : ' we conclude that the overall sentence imposed was manifestly excessive			0
' we also conclude that insufficient weight was attached to the mitigating features , in particular the devastating impact which the appellant 's conduct has had upon his personal life			0
