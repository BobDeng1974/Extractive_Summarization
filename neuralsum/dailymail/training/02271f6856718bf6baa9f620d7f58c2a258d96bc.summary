by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 21:48 est , 12 march 2014 updated : 09:08 est , 13 march 2014 jeopardy ! champ @entity4 , who won big money while taking heat for his renegade style , has been defeated			1
@entity4 finished in third place with zero dollars on wednesday 's edition of the syndicated quiz show			1
he had reigned for 12 days			0
his total winnings were $ 297,200			1
' a great run , ' summed up host @entity14			0
@entity4 had struggled for much of the show when , in @entity19 , he risked , and lost , his entire day 's bankroll - $ 6,400 - on the question : ' he was the last male monarch who had not previously been @entity34			1
' only @entity24 had the correct response : @entity36			2
the 30 - year - old @entity4 , a resident of @entity37 , @entity38 , has described himself on @entity39 as ' mad genius , comedian , actor and freelance voiceover artist			1
' he applied a ' mad genius ' approach to @entity19 ! brinkmanship			2
he ditched the time - honored practice of polishing off each category 's questions one by one			2
instead , he took a hopscotch approach to his category choices , which tended to keep his opponents off - kilter			0
defence : mr @entity4 spoke out against outraged @entity39 users , admitting he values $ 10,000 more anyway a little bit different : @entity4 , 30 , ( right ) @entity19 's latest and greatest star , has used @entity19 game theory to become nightly must - see tv			1
but his unorthodox methods have made him a polarizing figure nice gift : @entity4 celebrated turning 30 with the announcement of his third @entity19 win his accumulated winnings going up to $ 80,000 he also concluded that the bottom rows of the game board are most likely to contain the hidden @entity64 , and he played accordingly			1
@entity4 's strategy fueled indignation from @entity19 ! traditionalists , who contended that such an aggressive style was somehow unsportsmanlike and exhibited a lack of respect for the game			1
@entity4 ' rejected the unwritten rule that the guy or gal with the most facts wins , ' said on the @entity77 host @entity78 on an episode of the public radio show last month , ' and replaced it with the appalling idea that you can outwit your opponent with the wily application of game theory			1
' it was a style much different from that of legendary know - it - all @entity90 , who a decade ago set a @entity19 ! record with 74 consecutive victories while winning $ 2.5 million			1
knowing his weakness : in his second game , @entity4 he immediately admitted that he knew very little about sports , and wagered only $ 5 @entity4 , a 30 - year - old @entity38 insurance compliance analyst , who does freelance voiceovers , spent a month studying the quiz where people guess the questions to answers that pop up on the screen			1
when he first appeared on the show earlier this year , he baffled opponents by picking squares at random and betting strange amounts on his answers , rather than moving down the board in a straight line			0
@entity4 calls the strategy , which aims to disarm his opponents , @entity114 , after successful 1980s player @entity114 who also ' bounced ' around the board			2
his controversial strategy helped him win 12 times in a row			1
the strategy sparked outrage across social media , as viewers accused mr @entity4 of ' unsportsmanship '			1
but mr @entity4 dismissed the furor , telling @entity124 : ' like any game , strategy plays a big role			2
' @entity128 : @entity4 's game - play tactics appear to delight and frustrate viewers in equal measure tactics : part of @entity4 's strategy is to pick the highest value questions first where more of the @entity64 questions are hidden he added : ' i ca n't change your impression of me but , again , we 're playing for money			1
between $ 10,000 and getting haters on @entity39 , $ 10,000 is more important to me			0
' the so - called ' evil genius ' , as dubbed by angry @entity39 users , has also received support from the show 's host @entity148 , who said @entity4 ' seems to get ' the concept of winning			1
in the game , three contestants stand behind lecterns with a buzzer , a screen and a light pen			0
they are presented with answers to questions on a range of topics - history , science , arts , popular culture , literature , and languages - and must guess what was asked to reach them			0
each category has five clues , ranked in order of difficulty			0
for every correct answer , the player wins the value of the square - the easiest is $ 200 , the hardest is $ 1,000			0
playing to win : @entity4 went out of his way and jumped around the board to find as many @entity2 doubles as possible there are also ' @entity64 ' , where a contestant can stake as much money as they want on a pot luck question in the hope of doubling it			2
@entity4 is quick and confident with his answers , darting from a $ 1,000 question to $ 200 for seemingly no reason			2
but he has received a mixed reception from viewers with some sites such as @entity192 are calling him a ' hero ' , whilst others blogs like @entity195 describe him as a ' mad genius '			0
before appearing on the show , @entity4 claims he studied the mechanics of the gameshow that has been running for 30 years			2
love him or hate him ? some of the shows ' fans admire @entity203 s game strategy ' i decided pretty early on , you know , i 'm not going to be able to learn all the things i do n't know in terms of actual knowledge , ' he says			0
' you only get a month between when they call you and when you have to go out for the show			0
so i said , ' what 's the strategy that 'll serve me best on the show ? ' it seems that people do n't actually think about the strategy of the game itself as much as they do about the knowledge			0
' ' i quickly found stories about former champions like @entity220 and @entity221 and @entity114 who 've bucked the tradition of starting at the top of each category and slowly going down and achieved great success in the game			0
' ' there 's no logical reason to do that -- if you are able to take your opponents by surprise and keep them guessing and on their toes about what the next clue is going to be , you gain a major advantage over them			0
one of the few parts of the game you actually have any control over is your power to select the next question after answering a question correctly , ' he told @entity244			0
@entity4 has been tweeting his performance each night on his @entity39 account @ arthur_effect and through @entity248			0
interesting play : wednesday 's game was a wild one , where @entity4 went down to zero during @entity19 after missing a @entity64 , only to surge back into the lead before the ultimate wager generous : @entity4 's most interesting move so far was on wednesday 's show , when he entered @entity19 in the lead and intentionally wagered so that he might tie with another player , @entity257			1

@entity4 angered @entity19 ! purists with his unconventional style of play
he opts to choose the high - stakes questions first instead of starting with easier ones
his tactics helped him win , but they have frustrated viewers who are used to the way contestants traditionally play
the new @entity19 champion is @entity24
in all , @entity4 won $ 297,200 after 12 appearances on the show
