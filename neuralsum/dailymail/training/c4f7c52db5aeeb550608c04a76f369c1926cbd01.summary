@entity0 once faced a diplomatic row about roses			1
the incident , which saw the @entity4 mediate between @entity5 and @entity6 over who could name a rose after her , stretches for more than 40 pages in her 1984 files			1
the @entity13 leader was asked by the @entity5 @entity14 if it could name a flower in her honour			1
details of the incident spans 40 pages in her 1984 files in a speech to delegates who had travelled for a ' proper tea ' at @entity30 , she remarked that she was ' deeply touched by the honour '			1
mrs @entity0 added : ' a blue rose would be too much to expect			1
' ( i am ) delighted however to note that according to the grower , mr @entity36 , the rose is robust , stands strong on stems , and is very long - lasting			2
' but she had forgotten that in 1978 she gave permission for a @entity0 rose to be created by @entity6 firm @entity39			1
the story of the @entity5 rose made international headlines and mr @entity43 wrote to the prime minister in complaint			1
amid threats of legal action , a young diplomat named @entity49 , now ambassador to @entity50 , concluded that , although legally the @entity5 's may have done nothing wrong , they had acted disingenuously			1
after a drawn - out series of memos , it was eventually decided that the @entity6 should be appeased			1
personal papers found in @entity0 's 1984 files show the correspondence sent during the ' rose ' dispute a response was sent , reading : ' the two roses are different in appearance , but if an error has been made , the prime minister very much hopes that it can be satisfactorily and easily resolved			1
' we can understand your concern , and would like to assure mr @entity43 of our high regard for the masterpiece he named			2
' the matter was quietly dropped but not without occupying hours of the prime minister 's time			0
historian @entity75 , from the @entity74 , said : ' it goes to show that yes minister really happened			0
' it took up a lot of time but all they could really do was grin and bear it			0
' perhaps what 's most surprising is they were utterly humourless about the whole thing			0
' she even cancelled her hairdo calm and unflappable in a crisis , @entity0 showed resilience worthy of her reputation as the @entity94 when the @entity96 hotel bomb struck , the files reveal			1
she was so focused on continuing as normal that she even remembered to personally write to a hairdresser after cancelling an appointment in the aftermath			0
she had taken the difficult decision that the @entity13 conference must go on in spite of the atrocity , which killed five people and injured 31 on october 12 , 1984			2
among the dead were two high - profile @entity106 , and @entity0 herself narrowly escaped injury , but she refused to allow the tragic event to get to her			2
in the aftermath of the horrific @entity112 bombing in @entity96 on october 12 , 1984 , the then prime minister @entity0 ( above ) still managed to remember to call her stylist and cancel an upcoming hair appointment she carried on as usual the following day , attending meetings and meeting ministers but she did allow less essential appointments to slip			1
the files , newly released by the @entity119 , show that she instructed a secretary to cancel a hair appointment with @entity122 in @entity123 , @entity124			0
but not content with this courtesy , @entity0 wrote a personal note to thank hairdresser @entity127 for his work earlier in the week			1
she added : ' i was very pleased with the way you did my hair , and the fact that it lasted so well through friday was the real test			0
' according to mrs @entity0 's appointments diary , her dressmaker , @entity135 , had been due to visit her at @entity137 the following day but this was also cancelled			2
the phrase ' lunch at @entity137 ' is rubbed out , suggesting she also cancelled a meal with friends			0
it was not until she attended a church service on the following monday that she was seen to publicly weep , saying on television : ' this is the day i was not meant to see			0
' the letters sent from @entity30 confirm mrs @entity0 's hair appointment for the 1984 @entity13 conference newly - released letters sent from @entity30 reveal how @entity0 wrote to her stylist , @entity127 , apologising that she had to cancel in the wake of the @entity112 @entity96 bombing and offering to pay him anyway historian @entity75 , from the @entity74 , said : ' her reaction was partly out of necessity and her instinct to carry on			1
' i think she would have also been comforted by returning to her usual schedule			0
' but also it was a natural human reaction - i 'm sure many of us are familiar with the phenomenon of being in a car crash and not realising the harm that 's been done until later			0
' she was inundated with hundreds of letters from world leaders , political rivals and friends			0
mr @entity75 said : ' the number of her responses is so abundant and the touch so personal , we can see that she must have spent many hours of her time the following week handling that correspondence			2
' in one of the personal letters , her private secretary @entity175 said : ' we shall remember - not the bomb or the ruined building - but your courage , calm and nobility in the aftermath			2
' i can imagine how much shock and sorrow you had to overcome to show those qualities so splendidly			0
you turned evil into inspiration			0
