when it comes to playing tricks on people , especially parents it 's important to know when to stop			0
however , this did not appear to cross the mind of teenager @entity6 , who lives in the @entity7 , when she decided to prank her own mother			1
rather than put a whoopie cushion on her chair or balance flower on top of a door , @entity6 decided to amuse herself by faking her own kidnapping - any parents worse fear			2
as mean - spirited as the joke appeared , @entity6 certainly took the steps in order to make the prank as convincing as possible			0
she continued : ' i thought i was guna get taken man			0
thought he was tryna trick me into getting into the house ' ( sic ) before adding , ' not happy young lady			0
' @entity6 began her prank by convincing her mother that she had allowed a stranger to enter their home she then took the prank a step further by pretending to her panicked mum that the intruder had her phone , informing her mother that the kidnapper would require £ 4000 for her return her suspicious mother replies immediately with : ' @entity49 ? what decorator ? ! ? ! ! call me			1
' @entity6 then plays on her mother 's fears by pretending that the intruder now has possession of the phone simply replying : ' she knows that now			1
' at this point @entity6 's mother is completely fooled and has become more frantic insisting that her daughter calls her immediately			1
' who knows it ! ! call me please ' she replies before adding , ' now ' after her mother reveals that she is sending the police round @entity67 reveals that it was all a trick she convinces her mother by sending a picture of herself , her mother does not find it amusing at this point many would have called their panicking parent however @entity6 decides to take it up a notch			1
' my name is @entity77 ' she replies before demanding a ransom ' i have your child			0
i want £ 4000 to get her back			0
' @entity6 's mother tries to keep calm texting back : ' sending a neighbour round now ' but @entity6 simply insights more panic in her mother when she replies : ' good luck with that			2
' at this point @entity6 's mother informs who she believes to be the intruder that she has called the police : ' ok well police will be			2
' @entity6 attempts one more cheeky text as the intruder with ' she says hello ' before revealing that it was all a trick			1
she then reassures her mum by sending a picture of herself perched on their sofa			0
predictably the mother does not take this well ending the conversation by swearing at her daughter			0
although her mother may not have found the joke funny , after posting a photo of the messages on @entity105 , @entity6 received 18,000 retweets and 25,000 favourites .			1
