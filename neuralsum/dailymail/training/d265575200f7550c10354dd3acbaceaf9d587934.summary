the 41 - year - old comedian got an a * after undertaking the paper for the @entity9 to promote his maths @entity10			1
after completing the test - a gcse higher - level paper from june 2011 - @entity1 asked : ' are you sure that 's not an ordinary - level paper and then there 's another harder one ? surely ? what do you do if you 're really bright ? ' maths and theoretical physics graduate @entity1 has lamented the standard of a maths gcse paper he told the magazine : ' i do n't believe that my generation is the point at which evolution peaked			1
' that makes no sense to me			0
but i 'd find that paper very boring			2
i 'd be racing to finish it and get out of the door			0
' he added : ' there should be an additional , challenging paper			2
i do n't mind there being a general paper to help you get some idea of what kids can do			2
' but that 's like the first 10 questions that you can just bang off before you get to the meaty stuff			2
there 's nothing unexpected or unusual there			1
' and that 's why they 're not interesting			0
that 's the most telling criticism of it all - they 're not very interesting questions			1
' @entity1 , a maths and theoretical physics graduate , added : ' @entity58 is the language in which the universe is written			1
it 's innate to the human brain and is a spectacular thing that we 've discovered / invented			0
also it permeates our lives			0
mr @entity1 got an a * after undertaking the paper for the @entity9 to promote his maths tv show @entity10 ' if you have to discuss something in terms of its utility , we 're moving increasingly to being a technological society and therefore you need to be conversant with it			1
' but in all honesty , i am over discussing things in terms of their utility , as if education is just training for jobs - it is n't			0
' i encounter the same argument in teaching obscure languages : it fires neurons in different ways , helps you with problems			0
the example i quote is if people really understood probability , they 'd save a lot of money on lottery tickets			0
' @entity1 said that a report that the strongest @entity100 maths students , while on an equal footing with their counterparts in the @entity103 at age 10 had fallen two years behind them by the age of 16 , was ' shocking '			1
