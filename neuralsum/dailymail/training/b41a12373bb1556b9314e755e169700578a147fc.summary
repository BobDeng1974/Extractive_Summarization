@entity0 may seem like an act of desperation from @entity3 , hoping to get the @entity5 franchise back on track , but this is the best @entity5 title to date and one of the finest releases we ’ve seen in 2013			1
@entity0 is what @entity11 should have been			2
players are n’t hamstrung by a four hour prologue , nor are they tirelessly waiting for their character to find his groove			2
with blunderbuss in hand , @entity18 holds the player to rights from the game ’s opening moments and holds off on pulling the trigger until the final credits roll			1
stunning : whether you play it on this generation of console or wait for the next , @entity0 looks great @entity0 takes you back to the @entity30 where a pirate ’s life seemed to be for everyone			2
as @entity18 , a native @entity35 swabbing the decks and gulleys of a large privateer vessel , players will stumble upon the infamous assassin ’s order and suddenly embark on a whirlwind journey of fame and fortune			0
chartering his own vessel , @entity18 can take to the @entity45 with reckless abandon , whether it ’s firing down navy fleets , pillaging resources , plundering gold or discovering hidden islands rich with opportunity			1
by heading out on to the open seas , @entity0 presents players with new opportunities			0
rather than the vast , bustling cities we ’ve been used to in the past , @entity0 offers smaller ports , each with unique , hidden secrets			0
there are also @entity63 contracts available with financial incentives attached			0
@entity63 forts can be overrun and used to establish a foothold on the open waters			0
but to do so , you 'll have to deal with challenging weather conditions and intimidating wildlife , such as sharks			0
fortunately , @entity72 can always keep ship - shape with a series of improvements , such as fortifying the hull , increasing the number of sails and improving weapon competency			1
@entity18 can also rescue stranded sailors and invite them onboard to increase ship productivity			1
he can even force his crew to break out into a rendition of ‘ @entity84 ’ despite that , @entity0 is n’t a radical departure			0
the game is still taking cues from its predecessors , managing to encompass the best bits of @entity92 ’s adventure last year , such as tree - hop free - running , hunting , skinning and crafting , as well as familiar series staples from previous iterations , such as assassin contracts and challenges			1
best one yet : some were let down with @entity11 but @entity0 is a stronger game in almost every single way and , of course , it would n’t be @entity5 without denizens of collectibles to find			1
whether you ’re downloading emails and historical data from @entity5 or chasing @entity109 , moving marker stones for @entity111 or digging for buried treasure , @entity0 has an enormous sandbox environment to explore			1
the biggest in the series ’ history			0
but it ’s the graphics in @entity0 that really make @entity72 ’s adventure stand out			1
whether you ’re walking along golden sands , swimming through the wavy , murky waters , or standing outside in the middle of a terrible thunderstorm , these supposedly dated systems ooze elegance that seems almost impossible from eight - year - old hardware			2
@entity3 have confidently steered the stormy seas and put @entity5 back on track			1
for the naysayers and doubters who claim the series has fatigued , @entity0 is an absolute pleasure to play ; completely refreshing , exhilarating and infinitely rewarding			0
however you choose to play , @entity0 : @entity0 is a perfect swan - song for this generation of systems , and a faultless introduction for the next			0
absolute pleasure : some may think this is just another update , but there 's so much more than meets the eye follow us on @entity144 : @ @entity145 and on @entity146 : @entity147 .			2

pirates , plunder and pillaging make this the most fun @entity5 yet
*brilliant* ship combat makes for one of the game 's best surprises
@entity158 on impossible to take your eyes off @entity72 *...* a *stellar* *performance*
sea *shanties* !
