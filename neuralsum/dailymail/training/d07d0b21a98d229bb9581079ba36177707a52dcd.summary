by @entity0 published : 10:45 est , 5 march 2014 updated : 12:06 est , 5 march 2014 a jaw - dropping video shows the moment a climber plunges 60ft after the wall of ice he is scaling shatters and falls away from the cliff face - miraculously leaving him completely unhurt			1
@entity9 solo climbed the vertical ice wall at @entity12 # @entity11 in @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15			1
using only ice axes and crampons , mr @entity9 was carefully making his ascent until a misplaced strike shattered the ice , causing the entire frozen face to cascade to the ground			1
he said : ' it was a warm day , we got a good sense , like it was a healthy piece of ice there - and we wanted to climb			2
' i walked up to the ice and it was super thin , it was n't even as wide as my soldiers , i had to climb very delicately , it was intense			0
' i could feel the climb move under me , i had never encountered that before			0
' @entity49 : the climber stops and takes a look down , giving the viewer a dizzying sense of the danger he faces sheer fear : @entity9 's view of the exact moment the ice pillar cracks as the ice axe thuds into the surface a view from the climber 's headcam in the aftermath of his fall			1
he said it happened so quickly he barely knew about it he said the actual fall happened so sharply he did n't even realise what was happening			0
' it was fast - the tool struck the ice and i immediately felt that i was moving , ' he said			2
' i could hear the ice breaking and i realised the whole thing was collapsing and there was nothing i could do about it			0
' the sharp pieces of ice were digging into my body as i was sliding along the ground and i just waited for it to stop - and i was alive			2
' amazingly , mr @entity9 went climbing the very next day			1
he says the adrenaline is what drives climbers to constantly put themselves in precarious situations			0
he added : ' we scare the heck out of ourselves and laugh about it afterwards			0
it 's what keeps us coming back for more			1
' i got away with something really lucky			0
' his friend @entity93 said : ' if you are an ice climber ( the footage ) is going to leave you pretty much speechless			1
' it 's tonnes and tonnes of ice			2
' @entity9 on the floor directly after the fall			0
a huge chunk of ice from the sheet lies to his left			0
he was incredibly fortunate to escape the incident without injury mr @entity9 said : ' i walked up to the ice and it was super thin , it was n't even as wide as my shoulers , i had to climb very delicately , it was intense '			1

experienced ice climber @entity9 was ascending in @entity15 national park when the ice fell away
both the climber and tonnes of ice plunged 60ft to the ground - but incredibly he was only winded
*undaunted* , mr @entity9 was up and climbing again the very next day : ' it 's what keeps us coming back for more '
