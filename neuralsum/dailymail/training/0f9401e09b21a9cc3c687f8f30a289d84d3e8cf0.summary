by @entity0 published : 11:34 est , 24 january 2013 updated : 19:08 est , 24 january 2013 villagers campaigning against an illegal gipsy site on green belt land opposite their homes marked the 1,000th day of their round - the - clock protest camp yesterday			2
the hardy band , many in their seventies , have huddled under a tarpaulin with little more than a fire for comfort every day and night since the @entity13 gipsies arrived in may 2010			2
the gipsies bought the eight - acre paddock in @entity15 , @entity16 , for £ 100,000 but were stopped from laying hardcore when villagers formed a human chain to turn away their diggers			0
villagers campaigning against an illegal gypsy camp on greenbelt land mark 1,000 days of their blockade of the site			2
supporters @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 are pictured @entity29 changes the tally to say ' day 1000 ' to mark a defining moment in the 24 hour vigil since then around 200 members of @entity35 have braved storms , floods , snow and torrential rain to make sure there is no further development			0
last night , as temperatures dipped towards minus @entity44 ( @entity45 ) , the group marked the 1,000 - day milestone with a warming curry			0
the ' @entity15 gypsies ' paid a local businessman £ 100,000 for the paddock and moved onto it over the @entity52 in 2010 when the council were powerless to stop them			2
since the move , the determination of villagers to preserve the @entity58 greenbelt which separates the village from @entity60 and @entity61 has been relentless			0
residents descended on the eight - acre plot and formed a human barricade to prevent a convoy of lorries from delivering 1,800 tons of hardcore rubble to the site later that evening			1
ever since , around 200 residents have manned their camp around the clock to make sure the site is not developed any further , working to a rota with shifts lasting anything from an hour to overnight			1
the determined residents even had @entity78 dinner in their protest camp in case the travellers again tried to develop the site any further			1
the caravans at the illegal gypsy encampment in leafy @entity85 , @entity15 , @entity86 the 250 members of @entity35 , @entity35 , have been defiant against the site , pictured the snow - covered development where gypsy families are living			2
there are old and disabled people living in caravans on the plot of land the entrance to the site which the caravan owners have been told they must leave by march 31 in a @entity101 order but the residents did not have planning permission for the camp - which stands on a builders ' yard driveway immediately opposite the gypsy settlement - and , last february , the @entity103 - run authority voted to issue an enforcement against it			1
a month later the travellers at the site lost a @entity101 battle and now have to leave the site by march 31 this year			1
@entity114 , chairman of @entity35 , said ‘ we have been here in temperatures of minus 17 and we will continue			0
’ he said that the gypsies now keep a ' caretaker presence ' returning only during the day to deal scrap metal			0
local protesters are pictured outside the plot of land in the @entity16 on may 2 2010 after gypsys moved into the site over the weekend enjoying a cuppa : three campaigners are stood in the cold as they protest against the site he said : ' they are n't there at night , there are n't many people there at all , they just keep a caretaker presence			1
' some of them come here every day to deal scrap metal but they do n't live on the site			1
' none of them are local people , they came from all over the place as part of this scheme , it 's just about land value , if they can get planning permission they make a £ 100,000 piece of field worth millions			0
' it 's not about need , it 's about greed			0
determined : the villagers will not celebrate nor will they go home until the gypsys have moved the estimated 200 villagers are aged between 60 and 90 and say they have survived the floods and snow a makeshift tent was erected by the villages nearby the gypsy camp but council bosses ruled they had no right to be there ' we are n't celebrating the 1,000 days here , we will be marking it , we wo n't celebrate anything until they are gone and the land returned to the former state			1
' there is an order for them to leave the site in march and within a month return the site to greenbelt land			1
' but they say they are n't leaving , it will be up to the council to make sure it does n't turn into another @entity181			2
' we have survived freezing conditions , snow and even floods , you ca n't drive to the site now because of the snow			1
' but we wo n't leave until the site returns to it 's former state from the muddy mess it is now			1
' but despite the deadline for their eviction being just nine weeks away , the defiant gypsies today stuck two fingers up at the planning process - and vowed ' we will not be moved			2
' @entity194 , spokesman for the travellers , said : ' we are living in mud and s * * * , where are we going to go ' what are they going to do with us ? are they going to take us to the gas chambers ? it did n't work for @entity202			1
' they [ the villagers ] are the biggest hypocrites on the planet			0
it 's all about the value of their homes			0
' we have old people , we have disabled people			0
' if any other ethnic group of people had to live in these conditions there would be uproar			0
it would not be allowed , but gypsies are easy targets			0
' for 18 months i have bombarded @entity220 asking for somewhere to go			0
how are you going to resolve this ? ' if the council find us somewhere else to go then we will go , how are we supposed to find somewhere to go if they ca n't with all their massive resources ? ' if they have not found anywhere for us to go then we will not be going anywhere , put simply , we will not be moved			1
' the @entity101 has given the gipsies until march 31 to leave .			1

nearby residents have been making a stand for nearly three years
protestors , many of whom are in their *70s* , *refuse* to leave their post
travellers say there is nowhere for them to go and wo n't be moved
gypsys must leave the site by march 31 this year after losing @entity101 *bid*
