a @entity1 teacher is facing suspension for calling a 14 - year - old @entity6 student ' rag - head @entity3 '			1
@entity8 - @entity7 , from @entity9 , said @entity10 first called him names in his @entity13 class at @entity14 last month when he walked in wearing a hooded sweater			1
' and she said , " oh , no , the @entity3 is here " , ' he told @entity16			2
' and at first i took it as a joke because i did n't really know what @entity3 was			0
' i raised my hand , and she said , " yes , @entity3 " , and everyone just kind of laughed			0
' over the next several days , the 64 - year - old teacher , who often nicknames her students , continued referring to @entity26 as ' @entity3 ' - even calling him ' rag - head @entity3 '			1
they have called for the teacher to be fired or suspended the teenager , who is an honor role student and a @entity36 , asked his parents what the word meant , and they were shocked when they learned where he had heard it			1
' he 's a 14 - year - old boy , ' his father @entity33 , a @entity43 immigrant whose wife is from @entity45 , told @entity46			2
' he should not have to worry about these kind of actions from a teacher in a class in a school and in a state that advertises diversity			2
' the parents contacted the assistant principal of the school , and when asked about the name - calling , mrs @entity10 admitted that she had called their son ' rag - head @entity3 ' , @entity16 reported			1
the school then told the @entity60 that their son could move into another @entity13 class			1
' seriously ! ! ' mr @entity7 wrote on a @entity64 page detailing the incident ' she does the crime and he is the one to be punished			0
' accomplished : the @entity7 family , right , said their 14 - year - old son ' dh ' is a hard - working @entity36 and honor roll student who should not have to worry about such name - calling - especially from a teacher and when mr @entity7 asked the teacher about what she had said , her response was less than reassuring , he wrote on @entity64			1
' she responded with huffing and puffing accompanied with rolling eyes and arrogance , ' he wrote			0
' she showed no remorse whatsoever ! ' he said that at first he only wanted an apology , but now he is calling for the teacher to be fired or suspended without pay for a year			2
@entity84 has launched an investigation into the incident			0
' this situation is being taken seriously , ' it said in a statement			0
' the district launched an immediate investigation into the matter and will be bringing forward to the school board in march a recommendation for disciplinary action regarding this situation			1
' taking action : administrators at @entity14 said they are investigating			0
they will reportedly not fire the teacher but could suspend her for five days - but the @entity60 say that is not enough @entity46 reported that the teacher , who has worked for the district for 11 years and has no prior disciplinary record , will not be fired but could face a suspension			2
mr @entity7 said he was told she would be suspended for five days - but he said that is not enough			1
the school district is expected to take disciplinary action during a meeting on march 17			0
in the meantime , @entity26 , who is known to friends and family as ' dh ' , has been returning to the same @entity13 class but admits it 's awkward now			0
' i am extremely disappointed with her , and i guess you could say it 's sad that someone would think like that to this day , ' the boy said .			0

@entity8 - @entity7 said his @entity13 teacher , @entity10 , 64 , called him ' @entity3 ' when he walked into class at @entity14 last month
she called him the name repeatedly , inciting laughter from other students
when he asked his parents what the word meant , they contacted the school who said the boy could *switch* classes
but the parents called for the teacher to be fired or suspended and an investigation has been launched
the school has told them mrs @entity10 could be fired for five days but the issue will be heard at a district board meeting later this month
