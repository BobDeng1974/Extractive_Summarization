flight restrictions relating to drones and national parks , military bases and near airports are clear and strict			0
but since unmanned crafts have become more popular , homeowners and businesses are increasingly concerned about the drones flying over their private property			2
to allay these fears , a pilot from @entity11 has teamed up with drone makers to create a global database that lets anyone set up no - fly zones above their homes and offices			1
this address is converted into a latitude and longitude point which is then sent to drone makers and added to a no - fly database			1
many drones have technology that automatically prevents them flying over listed regions to add a zone , users must enter their location , name and an email address to verify the request			1
this address is converted into a latitude and longitude point , as well as a series of points that accurately marks out the edges of a property			0
for the first property the site does n’t ask for proof of residence , but for subsequent addresses users need to show a form of identification or utility bill			0
the address is then sent to drone makers and added to a no - fly database used each time a drone takes off			1

people who live near a blocked property and wish to fly their own drone , for example , must provide proof of residency			2
@entity89 will unblock that airspace upon request , and people can unblock their property at any time			2

at launch , founder @entity97 has partnered with manufacturers @entity99 , @entity101 , @entity102 + , @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106			0
by partnering with mr @entity97 , these makers promise to adhere to the registered zones but are not under a legal obligation to do so			1
and the size of the zone depends on individual makers , although mr @entity97 recommends it covers 500ft ( 152 metres ) around each property			2
other drone manufacturers are not obliged to comply to the no - fly zone you have established , however			1
legally , drones ca n’t be flown over restricted airspace including national parks , military bases and within a five mile ( 8km ) radius of medium and large airports			1
commercial drones are additionally subject to stricter laws and regulation			0
‘ evolving technology is allowing drones to have a positive impact on everyday lives through many applications			0
however , drones may also affect lives in a negative way , ’ explained mr @entity97			2
‘ many people are concerned about their privacy and safety [ and ] @entity138 offers these people a method to control the airspace above their property and to prevent drones from flying over			2
‘ while the @entity146 and other similar regulatory agencies around the world struggle with implementing rules about drones , drone manufacturers and operators want to take a proactive step to self - regulate and deliver quality products and services while minimizing negative consequences			0

data analysts recently created a map of the @entity168 that plots where owners can pilot their drones , and where specifically the drones are banned ( pictured ) ‘ our service physically prevents drones from flying over opted - out property by including those areas in the drone 's no - fly database			1
’ people who live near a blocked property and wish to fly their own drone , for example , must provide proof of residency			0
@entity89 then unblocks that airspace , and people can unblock their property at any time			0
the updates to the database are n’t made automatically , however			0
the site sends the database to drone partners on a monthly basis , and any new drones produced after drone manufacturers are sent the latest database will include the latest properties			2
‘ it could take some time before all in - service drones are updated to include your property in the no - fly database ' , continued mr @entity97			1
‘ in the future , when drones are connected by internet , we plan to update your privacy settings by pushing the information to the drones over internet in near - real time			0

database was set up by pilot @entity97 from @entity213 , @entity11
it lets people place no - fly zones above their homes or businesses
site asks for the location , a name and email address to verify the request
address is sent to drone makers and added to a list of restricted airspace
