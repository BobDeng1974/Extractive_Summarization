hacking group publishes @entity2 documents about @entity3 and @entity4 hackers vow to fight governments and corporations who are their ' enemy ' international swoop on hackers leads to arrests , including a 16 - year - old male from south @entity13 by @entity15 reporter last updated at 2:15 pm on 22nd july 2011 @entity2 is investigating claims that its computer network has been infiltrated after a group of hackers boasted they had breached the organisation 's security			1
@entity22 bragged that they had ' breached ' @entity2 's security and published two classified documents to prove their claims			1
the group wrote on @entity27 : ‘ yes , @entity2 was breached			1
and we have lots of restricted material			0
in the next days , wait for interesting data			0
’ defiant : the hacking group @entity22 brazenly poked fun at @entity33 and @entity2 it added : ‘ we are sitting on about one gigabyte of data from @entity2 now , most of which we can not publish as it would be irresponsible			1
’ the hackers also posted links to two documents to prove their claims			1
the first , dated august 27 2007 and marked ‘ @entity41 ’ , is a technical document about communication systems at the @entity44 for @entity46 forces in @entity3			1
the second document , dated 2008 and also marked ‘ @entity41 ’ , covers proposals for outsourcing communications systems for @entity2 forces in @entity4			1
defiant : the hacking group have declared a war against anyone who tries to stop them infiltrating the system a @entity2 spokesman said the organisation was investigating the claims from @entity22			1
he said : ‘ @entity2 is aware that a hackers group has released what it claims to be @entity2 classified documents on the internet			1
' @entity2 security experts are investigating these claims			1
we strongly condemn any leak of classified documents , which can potentially endanger the security of @entity70 , armed forces and citizens			1
’ @entity22 then took to @entity27 to mock @entity2 , saying they had seen their security procedures , but it would appear ' nobody ever read them '			1
hackers published this document they claim they found when hacking @entity2 's computer system then they said they laughed at @entity2 's ' battleships ' in the war against hackers			1
they released a statement to the authorities telling them to expect more hacking , ' they wrote			1
' these governments and corporations are our enemy			1
' and we will continue to fight them , with all methods we have at our disposal , and that certainly includes breaking into their websites and exposing their lies			2
' the hacking group is a loosely organized group of hackers sympathetic to @entity102			1
along with its splinter group @entity104 , it has claimed responsibility for attacks against corporate and government websites worldwide			2
@entity22 claims credit for disrupting the websites of @entity112 and @entity113 in december when the credit card companies stopped processing donations to @entity102 and its founder , @entity116			0
hackers from both have attacked websites including those of the @entity121 in @entity122 and @entity123 in @entity124 , and infiltrated networks belonging to @entity126			1
earlier this week @entity104 hacked into @entity128 website and published a fake news story claiming @entity130 had died of metal poisoning			0
on tuesday @entity122 authorities announced 14 arrests in connection with december attacks on @entity138 payment service @entity136 that were claimed by @entity22			2
after the international raid two other @entity122 , four @entity139 nationals and one @entity140 were arrested on suspicion of participating in other attacks against companies and organizations , @entity122 authorities said			2
the crackdown - the biggest reaction so far by @entity122 authorities to a string of cyber attack - has so far resulted in more than 60 arrests in @entity124 , the @entity122 , the @entity139 , @entity150 and @entity151			1
the swoop , which seized computers and other records , was meant to serve as a deterrent to others who may be considering joining the cause			2
those arrested , if convicted , could face up to 10 years in prison for trying to damage a protected computer			0
the @entity33 's arrests is providing a treasure trove of information and will lead to further arrests , a @entity122 law enforcement official told @entity166 on thursday			2
the law enforcement official said : ' this is the good example of a significant event that successfully removed a number of individuals from being part of the problem and will certainly lead to information that will result in locating other subjects			0
' while attacks by @entity22 and related ' hacktivist ' groups have drawn wide attention , other cyber crimes aimed at espionage are a higher priority for the @entity33			0
the latter have included intrusions at @entity183 , @entity184 and the @entity185			0
' we did n't pull resources away from those higher priority cases to work this , ' the official said			0
yet @entity22 and @entity104 , issued a defiant statement on @entity27 saying they would continue their efforts			0
in an indication that they would increase their hacking efforts if interfered with , @entity22 tweeted to the @entity33 : ' the more you arrest , the louder we 'll roar			2
' @entity197 , a cybersecurity expert with the @entity199 think tank , said @entity122 authorities were trying to warn people that they would track down hackers			2
' i think they ( the @entity33 ) are trying to send a signal that this is n't cost - free in the hopes that it will scare off some of the others			2
if we 're lucky it will work , ' mr @entity197 said			0
the law enforcement official said that people allegedly involved in the cyber attacks might no realize just how serious the crimes were and that prosecutors would likely seek stiff sentences			0
those arrested , if convicted , could face up to 10 years in prison for trying to damage a protected computer			0
' they 're probably not the types of people who have been prepared for any time in jail			0
this is not a joke , ' the official said			0
' the reality of the fact that this is both a crime and that people will be actually doing time in jail i think really has n't sunk in to a lot of people who are getting involved in these activities			0
' @entity197 said one possible benefit from the cyber attacks is that it will lead network and website administrators to beef up their security			0
' these guys exploit poor configuration , and that 's the simplest thing to fix but there 's just so much of it out there it will take a while , ' mr @entity197 said .			0
