' @entity225 ' refers to something that causes body tissue to die , and the infection can destroy skin , muscles and fat			0
the disease develops when the bacteria enters the body , often through a minor cut or scrape			0
as the bacteria multiply , they release toxins that kill tissue and cut off blood flow to the area			0

symptoms include small , red lumps or bumps on the skin , rapidly - spreading bruising , sweating , chills , fever and nausea			0
