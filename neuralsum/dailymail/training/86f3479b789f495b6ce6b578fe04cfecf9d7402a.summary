by @entity1 reporter published : 17:54 est , 22 february 2013 updated : 18:52 est , 22 february 2013 the @entity2 has suspended the flights of all 51 f - 35 fighter planes after a routine inspection revealed a crack on a turbine blade in the jet engine of an @entity9 , the @entity10 's version of the jet , in @entity12			1
friday ’s decision marked the second grounding of the warplane in two months and marked another setback for the $ 396 billion @entity17 , the @entity2 's biggest and most expensive weapons program			1
the program has already been restructured three times in recent years and may face further cutbacks if @entity21 does not avert major budget reductions due to take effect on march 1			0
the f - 35 program office said it was too early to know if the crack was a fleet - wide issue involving all three versions - the @entity10 's @entity36 , @entity37 ' @entity9 and @entity39 's @entity38 - but said it was suspending all flights until an investigation was completed			1
a total of 51 f - 35 jets were affected , including 17 that are being used for testing and 34 in use for training in @entity48 and @entity49			0
it said it was working closely with @entity51 , the @entity53 unit that builds the engine , and @entity55 , the prime contractor for the radar - evading warplane , to ensure the integrity of the engine and return the f - 35 fleet to flight as soon as possible			2
impact : a @entity63 lands at the @entity64 in @entity65 , @entity49 last november a part of the $ 396 billion @entity67 , the @entity2 's biggest and most expensive weapons program february 19 : all f - 35s grounded after crack found on low pressure turbine blade of @entity10 variant warplane january 16 : @entity37 ' @entity73 suspended for nearly one month after single engine failed during test flight in @entity48 january , 2012 : defense secretary @entity76 took @entity37 version of warplane off probation august , 2011 : flight and ground operations suspended after electrical problems on @entity10 aircraft march , 2011 : @entity84 grounded after dual generator failure on @entity10 test aircraft january , 2011 : then defense secretary @entity87 placed probation on warplane threatening to cancel fighter jet unless costs and problems were sorted within two years the @entity2 's f - 35 program office began notifying the chiefs of the @entity10 , @entity39 and @entity37 late on thursday about the engine issue and decision to ground the planes , said @entity98 , a spokeswoman for the program office			1
she said that a routine inspection at @entity101 in @entity12 on february 19 revealed a crack on a low pressure turbine blade that is part of the @entity9 's @entity105 engine			1
the blade was on an @entity107 , or @entity10 variant , which takes off and lands from conventional runways			0
@entity51 spokesman @entity111 said the inspection showed ‘ an indication of a crack ’ on the third stage low pressure turbine airfoil			0
he said the company was working closely with the @entity2 , @entity55 and the military services to get the planes flying again			0
engineering teams are removing the turbine blade from the plane and plan to ship it to @entity51 's engine facility in @entity125 , @entity126 , for more thorough evaluation and root cause analysis , according to the @entity2 and @entity51			1
replacing : the @entity9 is intended to replace older fighters like the @entity10 @entity130 , pictured , and the @entity39 @entity131 while hoping to purchase more than 2,400 @entity98 said an initial analysis was expected next week			2
the @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 , the @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140 are scheduled to purchase versions of the @entity9			1
the grounding comes on the heels of a nearly month - long grounding of the @entity37 variant of the new warplane after a manufacturing defect caused a fuel line to detach just before a training flight in @entity48			0
the @entity37 variant of the @entity9 , which takes off from shorter runways and lands like a helicopter , was grounded for nearly a month after a fuel line detached just before a training flight at @entity156 in january			2
that issue was later found to be caused by a manufacturing defect			0
the @entity2 and the @entity39 lifted flight restrictions on the b - model of the plane on february 13			2

flight operations of @entity9 were *similarly* suspended in january after an engine failure during test flight
the @entity9 program is the @entity2 's biggest and most expensive weapons program
@entity2 envisions purchasing more than 2,400 f - 35s
the @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 , the @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140 are scheduled to buy versions of the @entity9
