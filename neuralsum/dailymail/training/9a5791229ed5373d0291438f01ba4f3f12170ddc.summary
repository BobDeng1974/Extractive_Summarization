@entity0 : @entity1 could face another decade in prison if he does not repay £ 4.3m in criminal gains a ' 24 - carat ' smuggler who brought £ 100million worth of gold into @entity6 must repay £ 4.3million of the tax he dodged - or spend an extra decade in prison			1
@entity1 , 52 , was jailed for nine years in 2012 for spearheading an international smuggling ring which took precious metals from @entity11 in the @entity12			1
using an elaborate system of couriers , he swapped bags with his fellow smugglers in @entity17 to avoid £ 9million in vat because the tax is not payable within the @entity20			1
@entity21 at @entity22 branded him a ' 24 - carat criminal ' when the scam was finally foiled two years ago			1
images from the raid showed a laptop bag stuffed with gold jewellery including hundreds of bangles and bracelets			2
the total resale value of all the gold he brought into @entity6 was estimated at £ 100million			2
his trial heard he had benefited to the tune of £ 7million - but forensic accounting later raised that figure to £ 9million , @entity22 said			1
a judge has now ruled @entity1 must repay half of that figure - and the deadline has been set at four months			1
if he does not pay it back , another ten years will be added to his sentence			2
making the order , judge @entity43 said @entity1 still denied his guilt - but had been ' a dishonest witness who was quite prepared to lie in the face of overwhelming evidence			2
' an @entity22 spokesman insisted the figure was half of @entity1 's ill - gotten gains because the law states authorities can only claim assets which a criminal actually has			1
' if in the future he comes into money we can go back to court ' , a spokesman said			0
' just because he 's only having to pay back half it does n't mean he will never have to pay the rest back			2
it 's a life - long thing			0
' during the original investigation , it was discovered @entity1 had organised 120 scam trips between january 2007 and april 2008 , importing huge quantities of gold into @entity6 without paying tax			0
a courier would leave @entity6 in the afternoon , arriving in @entity11 early the next morning			2
24 - carat criminal : some of the gold bangles and bracelets smuggled by @entity1 , who used couriers swapping bags in @entity17 to avoid vat because the tax is n't paid on imports from within the @entity20 they would collect the gold before leaving @entity11 the same evening and returning to @entity6 via @entity17 , @entity83 , where they met @entity1 in an airside lounge			1
they would then swap bags – so @entity1 would leave with the gold and the courier would leave with an ordinary bag of clothes			1
the pair would then take separate flights back to the @entity6 , passing through the @entity20 ( @entity20 ) entry channel			0
in case he was stopped by officers , @entity1 carried forged paperwork which claimed he was a legitimate vat - registered gold trader who had travelled to @entity99 with the gold in his bag			1
but as he had n’t left the @entity20 , no duty would be payable on the gold			0
@entity1 , of @entity102 , west @entity103 , denied all involvement in the scheme when his case came to court in late 2012			0
but a jury at @entity108 in south west @entity103 found him guilty of conspiracy to cheat the public revenue , and he was jailed			0
two alleged couriers were charged and stood trial , but a jury found them not guilty			0
@entity114 : the gold was worth tens of millions of pounds - as the amount of @entity78 avoided alone was around £ 7m crammed : jubilant customs officials released these photos of @entity1 's laptop bag after his conviction in 2012 @entity22 investigator @entity121 said : ' @entity1 believed he had found the perfect fraud that was beyond detection , but he was wrong			1
' our investigators uncovered the fraud and addition to his current prison term , he will have to spend an extra ten years in jail unless he repays crime profits of over £ 4.3million within the next four months			1
' our work does n't stop with sentencing - we will pursue criminal profits to reclaim them for the taxpayer and the @entity6 economy			0
' @entity136 , assistant director , @entity137 for @entity22 , said previously : ' @entity1 was a 24 - carat criminal			0
he systematically evaded millions of pounds of @entity78 in the hope of lining his pockets			0
' our officers worked tirelessly to catch him , and the sentence is the result of that hard work			0

@entity146 , 52 , was jailed for nine years in 2012 for *massive* @entity78 fraud
couriers flew @entity11 gold through @entity17 in elaborate bag - swap con
now a judge has ordered him to pay £ 4.3million profits within 4 months
but figure is still less than half what he owes as assets can not be proved
