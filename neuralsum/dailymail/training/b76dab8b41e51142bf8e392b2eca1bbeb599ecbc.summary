i ’m not bothered about compensation - this is about my son and other children			0
‘ my son has not been the same since the accident			0
he seems to have lost confidence			2
he used to be very outgoing about playing outside but ever since the attack he wo n’t go beyond the garden			0
‘ he still gets very panicky around dogs and he often sees the dog that attacked him in the park			1
often in the morning he ’s very shaky , so i think he ’s having nightmares about what happened			0
attack : the youngster was playing outside when he approached @entity28 and his dog , a @entity5 - a hunting breed			1
his mother said the first she knew was the sound of her son 's scream ‘ he talks about not wanting it to happen to other children			2

' my son has not been the same since the accident			0
he seems to have lost confidence			0
he used to be very outgoing about playing outside but ever since the attack he wo n’t go beyond the garden ' boy 's mother at the hearing , @entity28 ’s solicitor @entity102 said the dog had been on a lead and had acted completely out of character and @entity28 could not have foreseen the incident			1
the court heard that a behaviour expert described the dog as a ‘ well - balanced animal ’			0
the conditions @entity28 will have to adhere to include the dog being muzzled and on a lead in public , and muzzled in the house when children under 16 are present			1

after the hearing , mr @entity2 said : ‘ it was a horrible , horrible accident			1
the dog did not approach the child , the child approached him			2
unfortunately i was distracted at that time and was looking at my other dog , which children were petting			0
' i have apologised in person to the boy ’s mother , i accept responsibility as i was in charge of the dog			1
he ’s sweet - tempered			0
he ’s never done anything like that before or since ' @entity2 , dog owner ‘ @entity145 does n’t like being stroked when he ’s out on his lead and i did n’t see or hear the boy come up , partly because i ’m deaf in one ear			1
it was one quick snap as a warning but it got the boy ’s lip			2
it was awful and i still think about it all the time			0
‘ i have apologised in person to the boy ’s mother , i accept responsibility as i was in charge of the dog			1

’ he added : ‘ i resigned from the party on the day i pleaded guilty			2
i ’ve been involved in the @entity34 for 30 years , it was important to me but it did not seem right to still hold that position after i had pleaded guilty			0
