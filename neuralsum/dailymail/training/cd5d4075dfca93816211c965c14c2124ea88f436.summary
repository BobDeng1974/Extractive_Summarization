@entity2 , seeing @entity0 next up in the fixture list would send a shiver down the spine			0
for certain clubs , the prospect of facing the @entity6 was such a daunting prospect that the possibility of gaining three points was never even considered			0
it would be backs - to - the - wall and all hands to the pump , especially at @entity14			0
@entity15 and @entity16 ( left ) were inspired as @entity17 beat @entity0 5 - 3 on sunday @entity18 and @entity19 endured a nightmare afternoon as @entity0 threw away 2 - 0 and 3 - 1 leads few teams would get the better of @entity0 during sir @entity23 time in charge the club 's aura of invincibility started to slip under @entity28 last season , with several clubs recording their first wins over @entity0 in many years how times have changed			1
since the retirement of sir @entity23 , clubs who were previously cowed by the @entity0 fear factor have been making gains			1
@entity17 became the latest on sunday with their memorable 5 - 3 win at the @entity39 , a result that continued @entity18 's poor start as manager			1
it 's fair to say this probably would n't have happened under @entity45 lost 13 of 19 meetings in all competitions during the @entity49 's long tenure at @entity14			2
but they are just the latest club to right the wrongs of the past when facing @entity0			1
defeat was the usual story for @entity45 when they came up against @entity0			0
here , @entity55 scores in a 4 - 1 win at @entity45 in september 2003 @entity57 scores for @entity0 in a 3 - 0 win at @entity59 in october 2000 last season , as @entity28 grappled with the pressure of managing the biggest club in the world , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 all took advantage			1
prior to 2013 , these were clubs who would consider a point against @entity0 a success			0
with @entity23 gone , they were suddenly unafraid			0
in late september last year , @entity60 won 2 - 1 at @entity14 , inflicting a third league defeat on @entity28 even at such an early stage of the season			2
under @entity23 , the @entity60 had only won one of 16 meetings in all competitions , losing 12 of them			0
@entity81 celebrates scoring @entity60 's winner at @entity14 in september last season @entity83 scores @entity0 's first goal against the @entity60 in march 2012 in the first week of december , both @entity61 and @entity62 claimed 1 - 0 wins at @entity0 , boosting wretched records dating back years			1
@entity61 had been regular adversaries for @entity0 during @entity23 's reign but they seldom tasted success - losing 35 of 57 meetings and conceding 97 goals overall			1
likewise @entity62 , who had won a mere six of 48 meetings in league and cups during @entity23 's quarter - century at the helm			1
among these dreadful results had been 6 - 0 , 6 - 2 and 5 - 1 thrashings			2
of course , the poor record made results like the 5 - 0 win at @entity101 in 1996 all the more famous but the general trend was miserable			1
@entity60 beat @entity0 2 - 1 at @entity14 last season @entity0 record under @entity23 ( all competitions ) - @entity106 16 w 12 d 3 l 1 f 40 a 15 @entity61 beat @entity0 1 - 0 at @entity14 and 2 - 0 at @entity107 last season under @entity23 ( all competitions ) - @entity106 57 w 35 d 11 @entity109 97 a 50 @entity62 beat @entity0 1 - 0 at old @entity14 last season under @entity23 ( all competitions ) - @entity106 48 w 28 d 14 l 6 f 96 a 49 @entity64 beat @entity0 1 - 0 in the @entity111 and also on penalties in the @entity114 semi-finals last season under @entity23 ( all competitions ) - @entity106 29 w 20 d 6 l 3 f 57 a 20 @entity63 beat @entity0 2 - 1 in the @entity116 last season and 2 - 1 in the @entity111 this season under @entity117 4 w 3 d 1 l 0 f 6 a 2 @entity17 beat @entity0 5 - 3 this season under @entity23 ( all competitions ) - @entity106 19 w 13 d 4 l 2 f 42 a 13 @entity119 beats @entity120 to score the only goal as @entity61 win 1 - 0 at @entity14 last season @entity123 celebrates the winning goal as @entity0 beat @entity61 1 - 0 at @entity14 in january 2009 @entity125 scored @entity62 's winner at @entity14 last season @entity127 finds the net in @entity0 's 6 - 2 thrashing of @entity62 at @entity101 in april 2003 @entity64 were another long - standing victim of @entity0			1
they had triumphed in a paltry three out of 29 meetings under @entity23 , losing 20 of them			0
yet they beat @entity0 1 - 0 at @entity14 in the @entity111 during @entity19 's temporary spell following @entity28 's sacking and dumped them out at the semi-final stage of the @entity114			2
@entity63 eliminated @entity0 in the @entity116 third round , their first win over @entity0 since january 1982			0
and as if to prove that @entity139 is n't necessarily an improvement on @entity28 , the @entity138 side beat @entity0 2 - 1 on the opening day of this season			2
@entity64 's @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145 celebrate their penalty shooout win in the semi-finals of the @entity114 last season @entity149 celebrates after scoring @entity63 's winner at @entity14 on the opening weekend @entity0 also suffered a humiliating @entity114 defeat at the hands of @entity153 earlier in the season now @entity45 can be added to this list			1
more will follow if @entity0 's woeful start to the season continues			1
this is not to mention the humiliating 4 - 0 thrashing at the hands of @entity153 in the @entity114			0
while it 's true that @entity0 did suffer some giant - killings under @entity23 - notably to @entity162 in 1995 and @entity163 in 2006 - they almost always had a weakened team out			2
@entity0 now look vulnerable to any opponent , the aura of invincibility is long gone			0
their opponents are gleefully turning history on its head			0

@entity0 lost 5 - 3 at @entity45 on sunday as @entity18 's poor start as manager continues
@entity45 the latest club who had a dreadful record when sir @entity23 managed @entity0 to start turning the tables
@entity0 's aura of invincibility and fear factor has gone since @entity23 retired
@entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity64 and @entity63 all recorded wins over @entity0 when @entity28 was in charge
@entity190 had dire records against @entity0 during the @entity23 years
