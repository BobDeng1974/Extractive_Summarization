the 1965 work , called @entity5 form , sat on the headteacher 's desk at @entity8 for years and was originally used as a house prize when students performed well			1
but was revealed as ' probably the most expensive paperweight in the world ' by stunned experts on @entity15 's @entity14 on sunday			2
the £ 80,000 sculpture @entity17 , pictured , was originally used as a prize for academic achievement before it became one of the world 's most expensive paperweights @entity23 , @entity8 head , said the paperweight would not leave the school in @entity26 , despite its value			1
he said : ' it 's sitting on my desk so it 's probably the most expensive paperweight in the world			2
dame @entity3 , pictured , was a governor at @entity8 in @entity26 and gave the sculpture as a gift			1
she died in 1975 ' we have links to the art scene because we live and work in @entity38 so we knew it was valuable but we 'd not had it valued			2
we did n't know it was that valuable			2
' not that it is of any consequence because it 's the school 's and it will remain the school 's			1
it 's a fabulous piece of work and it 's something which we do treasure			2
' mr @entity23 said @entity17 was given to the school by the artist - who used to be a governor there - many years ago as a gift			1
it was used as a prize for the house that achieved the most academic merits each term			1
@entity8 librarian @entity58 took the ' paperweight ' to show experts on the popular @entity15 show in @entity62 and beamed as she was told the news			1
visibly excited @entity64 , an expert in ceramics and glass , told the show : ' it 's by @entity3			2
' this is @entity69 , you know , you can not confuse it with anything else			0
' it is very tactile and made of bronze			0
it 's worth £ 60,000 to £ 80,000			0
and it 's a very important thing			0
it 's a seriously exciting find			0
' there 's a lovely sense to it and turning it around is quite fun because it looks completely different from all angles			0
' it 's easy to forget that here in @entity26 we 're actually at the cutting edge of @entity69 really			1
@entity3 was really at the forefront of @entity88			0
' tourists flock to @entity38 to see @entity3 's large bronze @entity91 sculptures in the @entity92			0
another sculpture sits outside the @entity94 , home to @entity96 but this smaller example of her work is not widely known			1
tv antiques expert @entity64 , pictured , described the piece as a ' seriously exciting find ' and said it was worth up to £ 80,000 the staggering valuation of the bronze was a surprise to the school , who expected it to be worth considerably less			1
mr @entity23 added : ' it 's not something we let out of our sight now			0
' the guy on @entity14 said it will be in the upper reaches because it 's such a beautiful domestic piece			0
' for them it was a significant find			0
it did look lovely on the television with the light catching it			0
it is beautiful and a very tactile piece			0
' the school is now considering creating imitations of the original to hand out as school prizes			2
@entity17 is in good company at the school , which has two @entity130 paintings and a @entity132 sculpture .			1
