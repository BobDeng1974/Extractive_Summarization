dozens of asylum seekers have been put up in a hotel at a cost to the taxpayer of almost £ 2,500 a night after facing delays over their right to stay in the @entity7			1
the group has been given accommodation at a three - star hotel near @entity11 while waiting for the @entity12 to decide on whether they can remain in the country			1
around 30 people were given taxpayer - funded beds at the @entity17 in @entity18 , which sits opposite the @entity19 , home of @entity20			1
it comes after it emerged last week that around 150 asylum seekers are being put up at seaside hotels in @entity32			1
some 130 asylum seekers were also revealed to be staying at the @entity34 in @entity35 , @entity36 , close to the @entity37			1
@entity38 , the company which has a £ 120m five - year contract to find housing for asylum seeks in the @entity43 , confirmed it had made the booking at the 126 - room hotel , where rooms costs up to £ 79 a night			1
it is understood the asylum seekers were transferred from their overcrowded accommodation in @entity50 at the weekend			1
the company said the problem arose due to the number of people in the @entity7 looking for asylum , having fled from conflicts and problems around the world			2
but the move has been criticised , with one labour mp saying the @entity60 ' really needed to pull its finger out '			0
meanwhile , the @entity62 said the use of hotel rooms should be ' a last resort '			1
last week , it emerged more than 88 asylum seekers were staying at the three - star @entity68 , 10 minutes walk from @entity32 beach at least 67 were being accommodated at the three - star @entity71 in @entity32 the bill for the hotels will be picked up by @entity38 , which is paid a lump - sum to run the service on behalf of the @entity12			1
@entity79 's political director of the @entity62 said : ' the government must keep asylum seekers safe and housed , but they ca n't allow the costs to taxpayers to spiral			1
' hotels are more expensive than almost any other method of housing , so it must only be a last resort			0
' @entity89 , @entity90 mp for @entity91 , said : ' @entity92 really needs to pull its finger out and as soon as possible and process these people 's applications for asylum			2
' they should either agree they are refugees and help them start a new life , or if decided that they are not legitimate , send them back to their country of origin			0
@entity38 was awarded its five - year contract after home secretary @entity105 outsourced the asylum rehousing service to three separate companies ' these are people who have had to flee the most incredible situations and all they want is a place of security and to lead a more normal life - you ca n't do that in a hotel			1
' to live your life in a hotel is absolutely appalling			0
housing asylum seekers in hotels is n't costing the borough anything			1
we all pay through our taxes , but we are not paying through our council tax to re-house these people			2
' @entity127 of charity @entity128 said : ' the reason people are being moved into hotels is not due to an increase in numbers of asylum seekers			1
it is down to a backlog in @entity12 decision making			0
' the reality is that private providers have not found enough properties for people to be moved into			0
this is yet another example of the government 's failure to support vulnerable people			0
' the @entity12 provides accommodation and support for asylum seekers in the @entity7 who are assessed as being ' destitute '			1
@entity38 - which has been warned against the use of hotels - was awarded the contract for the private housing of asylum seekers in 2012			1
a spokesman for the @entity12 said it could not divulge the cost of the contract because of ' commercial sensitivity '			2
but , according to a response to a @entity160 request on the government website , @entity38 has a total value contract of £ 121.2m , which runs from june 2012 to may 2017			2
at the end of 2012 , the @entity164 ( @entity164 ) replaced 22 separate contracts provided by 13 different suppliers with six contracts to cover the £ 620m system			0
these were divided between @entity170 , @entity38 and @entity171			0
the move , spearheaded by home secretary @entity105 , was known as the @entity173 ( @entity174 ) project and was supposed to save public money			0
but a @entity178 report in january found that @entity38 was failing to meet targets on the standard of accommodation and waiting times			2
it said the company could be asked to pay back up to £ 4 million to the government for poor performance			0
@entity187 , @entity38 's contract director for @entity174 , said : ' @entity38 operates the contract to house asylum seekers requiring accommodation in the @entity43			1
' given international events , there are currently more people looking to the @entity7 for asylum , having fled from the many conflicts and problems around the world			0
' we are now consulting urgently with @entity199 and the @entity12 to see how people can best be looked after in line with our contract and the government 's statutory duties			2
' we fully understand both the challenges that local communities face and how vulnerable these people can be			0
our priority is at all times to make sure that they are safe and secure and are treated with dignity and respect			0
' the @entity12 said : ' the @entity7 has a proud history of offering sanctuary to those who need it			0
' we have made clear to our providers that the use of hotels is only ever acceptable as a short - term measure			0
' a spokesman for @entity17 said : ' we do have a number of people staying with us on a very short - term basis through bookings made on behalf of the government			2
' however we do not comment on the specific details regarding individual guests			0
