two - year - old @entity11 was born without retinas and has never been able to see			1

@entity11 ( left ) was born without retinas and has never been able to see , so he relies on his father @entity13 ( right ) @entity21 , 65 , who often looks after the pet for his granddaughter @entity23 , 14 , said : ' @entity11 was blind from birth and it seemed that he was always running or knocking into something and hurting himself			1
we were really worried about how he was going to cope			2
@entity21 says the pair share an ' incredible ' bond , with @entity30 leading his son around , and licking him if he bumps into something ' but we started to take @entity11 and @entity32 on walks together and it was amazing to see @entity32 starting to take charge , looking after @entity11 and checking he was okay			1
' he added : ' it is unbelievable the bond that they have			2
if @entity11 walks into something and yelps @entity13 is back like a shot licking him in the face			1
it is marvellous to see , a treat to watch			0

following discussions with @entity45 vets mr @entity21 wears bells at the bottom of his trousers to let @entity11 know where he is			1

he said : ' he lives life to the full			0
he has a great sense of smell , he can smell things from so far away , he must be compensating for having no eyes			2
he loves getting petted and made attention of			0
' he is adorable , he is a wee cutie			0
' @entity45 senior vet @entity72 said the bond between @entity11 and his father is a reminder of how dogs continually surprise us with their character and abilities			1

they 're extremely social animals and can help both pets and people in ways that never fail to amaze			0
' it 's inspiring to us all that @entity32 acts as a guide dog to his canine companion and how he looks after his son to the best of his ability			2
mr @entity21 wears bells on the bottom of his trousers so @entity11 knows where he is , and puts strong smelling liquids such as lemon or lime juice in dangerous places around the house so @entity11 knows not to go there @entity30 has not had any guide dog training and has picked up on ways to help his son by pure instinct ' it 's nice to see that all of @entity11 's family - both owner and fellow dog - are working together to make sure that he can live life to the full			1
' the charity said that while blindness in pets can be challenging for owners , with the right support it is possible to help pets adapt well to their surroundings			0
if a dog has a problem with their sight , vets can discuss treatment options and offer support and guidance in dealing with the condition			0

dogs have an extremely well - developed sense of smell which can be up to 100,000 times more sensitive than a human 's , depending on the breed .			0
