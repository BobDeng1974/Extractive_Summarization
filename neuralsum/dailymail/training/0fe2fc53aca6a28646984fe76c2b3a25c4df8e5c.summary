by @entity0 for @entity1 commuters in @entity3 have found themselves stepping into the biggest sporting stages in the world - or at least imitations of them , thanks to a subway train specially decorated to mark the 2014 @entity10			1
the @entity12 city is hosting the two - week long games , which feature 208 countries , 30 events and some of the world 's most promising young athletes			1
to mark the occasion , the floors of this subway train have been turned into football pitches , basketball courts and even swimming pools - complete with athletes motoring along underwater			1
unsurprisingly , @entity12 currently sit top of the medal table , with 10 medals including four golds			2
@entity29 are second and @entity30 are third , while the @entity31 sit just outside the top three in fourth and @entity33 and tenth , with one gold , two silvers and a bronze			0
@entity39 's gold was won by @entity40 , 15 , in the triathlon , beating @entity43 's @entity42 in a nail - biting photo finish yesterday			2

this time , 33 15 - 18 - year - olds make up the team whose star is @entity53 junior gymnastics champion @entity52			0
her sister @entity54 competed in @entity55 2008 , and @entity52 will be hoping to follow in her footsteps in @entity57 in 2016			0
making a splash : the floors of a subway train in @entity3 , @entity12 , have been decorated to resemble sporting arenas to mark the @entity61 in the city having a ball : commuters enjoy a rather sportier trip around the city , perching on the sidelines of football and basketball - themed subway carriages @entity70 : the @entity71 go for for just under two weeks , and feature many of the same sports we saw at @entity74			1
