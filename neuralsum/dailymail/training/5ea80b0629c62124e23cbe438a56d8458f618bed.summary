to @entity1 , @entity0 is a mixture of @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5			1
in @entity6 , he is considered a @entity7 – something even the @entity9 has to accept			0
at the age of 38 , the greatest @entity1 player of his generation – better than @entity14 or @entity15 – will make a rare appearance in @entity18 on tuesday night in his quest to try and win the one major trophy , the @entity10 , missing from his collection			1
and judging by his performances this season , the oldest swinger in town is n't ready to go home yet and tuck in with a nice cup of cocoa			0
@entity0 has been a pivotal player for @entity29 since his professional debut for his boyhood club in 1992			1
here is a compilation of images from each of his 23 seasons at the @entity39 club			0
top left is from his first season in 1992 - 93 to the bottom right image from the current 2014/15 campaign			2
the forward will be a major threat to @entity47 's hopes of progressing past the group stages of @entity50 's elite competition @entity0 , like @entity51 legend @entity4 , has managed to play in a top @entity53 league while in his late - 30s @entity1 football was littered with a number of world class players during @entity0 's first season in the club 's senior side			1
@entity29 's rivals @entity61 went onto win the title in 1993 with 50 points from 34 games			1
teams were awarded just two points for a win in 1993 , as compared to the three points you now collect after a victory			2
@entity73 's @entity72 finished as the league 's top scorer with 26 goals , while the likes of @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80 were also plying their trade in @entity82			2
to call @entity0 the archetypal no 10 with balance , vision , quick feet and set - piece goals does n't begin to his incredible career justice			1
like @entity3 , he is a revered local hero , always staying faithful for his hometown club @entity29 when @entity50 's biggest clubs would have taken him in an instant			2
like @entity4 , he refuses to play by the normal rules of ageing and goes on and on , scoring until now a club record 235 goals in 564 games			2
and like @entity5 , his style and private life are great sources of fascination			0
his wife is n't called @entity103 but @entity104 is a former showgirl and model , and the pair are @entity82 's premier celebrity couple			0
their wedding was screened live on @entity1 television in 2005			0
current @entity29 manager @entity112 quickly realised to succeed in @entity82 's partisan capital , you have to pay homage to @entity0			1
' for me he is one of the very best players in the history of the sport , and someone with great qualities as a man , ' he pointed out shrewdly			0
@entity0 's trophy cabinet includes @entity39 , @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125 winners ' medals despite competing against @entity128 and the two @entity61 clubs			2
the @entity10 is the one he really wants now before retirement and he has a particular axe to grind with @entity132 ahead of tuesday night 's game against @entity47			1
in 2007 , he was part of a @entity29 side humiliated 7 - 1 at @entity136 when his ego was dealt a huge blow by being completely overshadowed by @entity139 and @entity140			1
to tap into the @entity0 psyche , you have to understand his relationship with the club			2
@entity29 manager @entity112 , pictured with @entity146 ahead of his side 's clash with @entity47 , has labelled his captain one of the best players in the history of sport @entity0 is expected to start against @entity47 at the @entity152 on tuesday night - along with former @entity153 star @entity146 one of the 38 - year - old 's biggest career lowlights came in april 2007 when @entity29 were thrashed 7 - 1 by @entity51 at @entity136 as a teen , he used to ride a scooter from his home in ' authentic @entity6 ' , the @entity160 district , to watch the @entity161 play in the @entity162			1
he made his @entity29 debut way back in 1993 when @entity39 boasted great names like @entity165 , @entity79 and @entity166			1
@entity167 3 - 1 @entity47 ( march 24 1993 ) starting line - up : @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity179			1
subs : @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity183			0
it was his creativity that set him apart from other players			0
he played for @entity82 in the final of @entity187 and the following season inspired @entity29 to only the third @entity39 title win in their history , under the leadership of @entity191			1
@entity29 had some great players in that team - @entity194 , @entity78 and @entity195 among them – but @entity0 was the captain and undisputed @entity196			1
it was fitting he scored the opening goal in the 3 - 1 victory against @entity200 that clinched the league			2
@entity0 was just 24 at the time and the world was at his feet			2
@entity128 owner @entity205 would have sold @entity206 to get him to @entity207 but the player wanted to stay at home			0
@entity61 and @entity210 have also come knocking at different times			0
he might not have won as many trophies but he received an adulation among his own fans never replicated before or since			0
when he scored a key last - minute penalty for @entity82 against @entity216 on the way @entity218 becoming world champions , @entity0 said although the experience was memorable , it could n't compare to winning @entity222 with the team he supported as a boy			2
from that moment , he was as untouchable to @entity225 as one of their emperors			0
@entity80 ( left ) and @entity166 ( right ) played in @entity39 for @entity61 and @entity73 respectively during @entity0 's first season at @entity29 @entity0 was part of the @entity1 side which won the 2006 @entity125 against @entity231 at the @entity162 in @entity232 , @entity233 he and @entity104 were granted the ultimate honour , a speaking part in @entity236 , later in 2006			1
the following year , he appeared in the movie @entity238 2 as a defence attorney			0
in recent years he has been in regular demand on television , both chatshows , reality shows and dramas			0
a collection of figurines entitled ' @entity0 , the captain ' were made in his honour			1
now @entity249 ( @entity250 ) is very much the senior man , playing under his 14th manager in 20 seasons in @entity6			0
though @entity29 boast names like @entity255 , @entity146 and the rejuvenated @entity256 , @entity0 's name will be the one that will grab most attention at the @entity152 on tuesday night			1
he is the @entity6 's ultimate @entity259 , and always good for a news story ; whether it 's by celebrating a goal by shoving a ball up his jumper and simlulating childbirth , or claiming that only @entity265 is better among modern players			0
as he approaches 40 , even @entity0 must realise he wo n't have many more chances to fulfil his @entity10 ambition			1
city must be wary - this guy writes his own scripts			0
like @entity273 's facebook page .			0

@entity29 captain @entity0 is expected to line up against @entity47 on tuesday evening
like former @entity51 *midfielder* @entity4 , @entity0 has been able to compete in a top @entity53 league during his late - 30s
the 38 - year - old made his @entity29 debut in march 1993 , aged just 16
@entity0 has yet to win the @entity10 with boyhood side @entity29
