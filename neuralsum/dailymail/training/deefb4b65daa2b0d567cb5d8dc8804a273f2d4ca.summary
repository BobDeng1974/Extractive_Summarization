a beach hut is on sale for £ 225,000 despite not having mains electricity , running water , or - and some would say this one 's pretty crucial - a sea view			1
the 13ft by 13ft timber shack on @entity8 near @entity9 , @entity10 , is divided into a living area , bedroom and mezzanine and is one of the most expensive beach huts ever to go on sale			1
but although glimpses of the sea can be seen from side windows , its front porch looks out on little more than sand dunes and grass - and there 's a public toilet round the back			1
room with a loo : a beach hut on @entity10 's @entity8 is on sale for £ 225,000 despite not having mains electricity , running water or a sea view - and it 's next to a toilet the sea ? oh , it 's just over there : the hut 's furnishings are slightly dated compared to others , and it faces sand dunes , but it 's one of the largest on the peninsula it also requires a half - hour walk or a ride on a novelty tourist ' land train ' from the nearest parking space			1
at the same price as a detached house in @entity52 - which costs on average £ 218,000 - it outstrips the highest previous selling price for a hut on the spit by £ 55,000			2
sold in 2012 , the 18ft by 10ft timber retreat which held the previous record was shifted just two days after it went on sale amid bidding frenzy			0
for less than the hut now on sale , buyers could snap up a five - bedroom detached house in the south @entity66 village of @entity67 , near @entity68 , which is on sale for £ 199,950			1
or for £ 180,000 they could buy an entire church ' with conversion potential ' in almost an acre of land in the village of @entity75 , near @entity76			2
but the estate agents selling this chalet insisted it was worth the price because it is one of the largest on the peninsula - which , like nearby @entity82 , has become a premium spot for buying seaside homes			2
upstairs , downstairs : estate agent @entity87 said the hut 's value was increased by having a mezzanine level			1
it is one of the most expensive ever to go on the market kitchen : the hut has no mains electricity , but it does feature this charming gas hob , and there 's even a fridge			1
it 's claimed the chalet sleeps 10 , at a push both areas have a ' perfect storm ' of factors which push up prices , including that they are situated between harbours and the sea , have been largely owned within families and there is no room left for any new buyers to expand onto the narrow strips of land			1
the public toilet could also , in fact , come in useful - as the hut and others like it do n't have one of their own			2
at a stretch : the sea is visible by standing on the steps and craning one 's neck @entity87 , of @entity126 , said : ' the hut has been in the same family for donkey ’s years and it has got potential for people to put their own style on it			1
' it has a living space , an integral bedroom and a mezzanine level and can sleep up to 10 people			1
it features 12 volt solar electricity through solar panels on the roof and has lighting , a fridge and a cooker which is run by gas			0
' @entity146 hits at @entity8 tend to have a mezzanine floor and the value seems to increase because of it			1
this is a good size hut and i think that ’s where the value is , it ’s suitable for a larger family or for friends which much be sharing it			0
' he added : ' the hut has sea glimpses as it is set back about 30 yards from the beach			1
there is nothing in front of it but grass , sand , and a path			0
' as well as the hefty price tag , the new owners will have to pay a £ 15,000 transfer fee and more than £ 2,600 a year in ground rent to @entity173			0
in order to see the sea , the new owners of the beach hut will need to stand on the top step leading up to the decking and then look towards the left			2
if it sells for the asking price , the cabin will just fall short of becoming the most expensive beach hut ever sold in @entity184			2
another on the @entity185 in @entity186 , south @entity187 , sold for £ 245,000 in 2012 despite being just 6ft wide			0
but unlike the @entity8 huts , it was a new build with under - floor heating , a marble wet room , wireless internet , and electric windows which automatically close when it rains			2
measuring 23ft long , it also boasted a fitted kitchen , a rear patio , tv , dvd and one mezzanine bedroom			2
@entity204 , chairman of the @entity205 , said : ' back in the 1980s , the beach huts would have sold for around £ 6,000 or £ 7,000			0
' now , people are paying around £ 150,000 for one			0
compared to how house prices have changed , there ’s a significant difference			0
' beach huts have outstripped property prices over the years by several times			0
' picturesque : the quiet village of huts is on a peninsula with @entity9 harbour on one side and the @entity219 on the other , and can not be reached by cars spending a lot more than a penny : the hut , pictured in green , is right next to a public toilet block - useful if nature calls while the 10 people squeezed in are sleeping idyll : thanks to its secluded sense of calm and good sizes by beach huts standards , @entity8 has become one of @entity184 's priciest areas by cost per square foot many luxury beach huts on the market cost more than a brand new , fully - functioning home			1
in the last few months some beach huts across @entity184 have been marketed for vast amounts			0
they included a hut on @entity245 near @entity246 , which featured in the title of a novel by @entity249 , which went on the market for £ 300,000			0
in @entity9 , @entity10 , there are beach huts up for sale for £ 225,000 , with some estate agents marketing them as ' one - bedroom terraced properties '			1
but there are bargains to be had			0
in @entity261 , @entity262 , the cheapest beach huts are on the market for £ 7,000 while in @entity265 , @entity266 , one hut was recently on sale for £ 14,000			0
another , in a prime position on the seafront at @entity269 , @entity270 , was on the market two weeks ago for £ 18,000 , decorated in pastel colours with a 1950s floral interior .			0

13ft square timber shack is on desirable @entity8 near @entity9 , with living area , bedroom and mezzanine
glimpses of the sea can be seen from side windows , but the porch looks out on sand dunes and a toilet is behind it
hut has no mains electricity or running water and can only be reached by walking or catching a novelty ' land train '
but there is one *advantage* to the dated £ 225,000 shack *...* it 's one of the most expensive on the premium peninsula
