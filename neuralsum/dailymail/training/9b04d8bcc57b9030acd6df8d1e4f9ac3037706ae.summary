by @entity0 published : 08:17 est , 16 july 2012 updated : 08:17 est , 16 july 2012 a year after @entity4 ended the three - decade - long @entity6 space shuttle program , thousands of formerly well - paid engineers and other workers around the @entity3 are still struggling to find jobs to replace the careers that flourished when shuttles blasted off from the @entity11 ' @entity10 '			1
some have headed to @entity13 to build airplanes in that state 's growing industry , and others have moved as far as @entity18 to work as government contractors			1
some found lower - paying jobs beneath their technical skills that allowed them to stay			2
many are still looking for work and cutting back on things like driving and utilities to save money			2
unemployed : former space shuttle worker @entity29 poses in front of a mock space shuttle at the @entity32 in @entity33 , @entity11 ' nobody wants to hire the old guy , ' said @entity29 , a 62 - year - old former project manager who worked 33 years for the shuttle program until he was laid off after @entity37 landed last july 21			1
' there just is n't a lot of work around here			2
or if so , the wages are really small			2
' @entity29 earned more than $ 100,000 a year at the end of his career at the space center			2
the prospects of finding a job that pay anywhere near that along the @entity10 are slim			2
' i could take an $ 11 - an - hour job that is 40 miles away , ' he said ' but with gas prices and all that , it 's not really worthwhile			1
' more than 7,400 people , who once had labored on one of history 's most complicated engineering achievements , lost their jobs when the shuttle program ended last july			1
while other shuttle workers in @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 , @entity61 lost jobs , those areas had bigger economies to absorb the workers			1
in less economically diverse @entity70 , the mainly contractor positions cut by @entity4 accounted for just under 5 per cent of the county 's private sectors jobs			1
dead - end : thousands of formerly well - paid engineers and other workers around the @entity3 ( pictured ) are still struggling to find jobs the @entity3 's current workforce of 8,500 workers is the smallest in more in than 35 years			1
in the middle of the last decade , the space center employed around 15,000 workers			2
@entity82 , a 48 - year - old quality inspector for the shuttles , has applied for 50 positions with no success since he was laid off in october 2010			0
he has taken odd jobs glazing windows for a luxury hotel in @entity89 and working as a security guard			0
he has no health insurance and incurred a $ 13,000 bill when he was hospitalized for three days last may			0
' with most companies , it 's like your application goes into a black hole , ' @entity82 said			1
' we 're struggling to stay afloat			0
' jobless space workers have signed up for @entity101 's job placement and training services			1
slightly more than half of the 5,700 workers the agency has been able to track have found jobs , but more than a quarter of those positions were outside @entity11			1
those jobs have been in the fields of engineering , mechanics and security , according to the agency			0
borrowed : @entity4 is relying on the @entity117 - made @entity116 capsules to send @entity6 astronauts to the international space station @entity70 's unemployment rate spiked in the months that the shuttle program wound down , going from 10.6 per cent in april 2011 to 11.7 per cent in august 2011			1
it has since declined to 9 per cent , a result of a smaller workforce as many former shuttle workers either moved away or retired earlier than planned			1
@entity70 has added 2,700 jobs since the beginning of the year , but many are in the southern part of the 72 - mile - long county where information technology giant @entity131 and airplane - maker @entity132 are located			1
jobless space workers in the northern part of the county jokingly refer to those high - tech workers as ' their rich cousins '			0
some local employers are finding that the former space workers ' salary demands are sometimes too high			0
' stop sending former @entity3 employees , ' one employer wrote to @entity101 , the local job agency , in a comment included in its monthly committee report			1
' they have an unrealistic salary expectation			0
' taxpayer money allocated for job training programs for displaced space shuttle workers also is dwindling a year after the program ended			1
adding to the difficulties of finding a new job is the age of many of the former shuttle workers			1
many spent their entire careers working on the space shuttles and are now in their 50s and 60s			0
new roles : many of the space workers are volunteering at @entity3 , giving tours to dignitaries and providing oral histories to tourists who stop by the @entity167 in between sending out resumes and meeting at networking events , many of the space workers are volunteering at @entity3 , giving tours to dignitaries and providing oral histories to tourists who stop by the @entity167			1
even though many of the older space workers like @entity29 had years to plan for the end of the shuttle program , they stuck around , hoping to prepare the orbiters for displays in museums in @entity11 , @entity182 and @entity183 after the program ended			1
they expected younger shuttle workers to move over to the successor @entity184 whose goal was to send astronauts to the moon and then @entity190			1
but the cancellation of the @entity184 in 2010 increased the competition for those few jobs left prepping the shuttles			0
some shuttle workers , such as @entity196 , had been holding out hope that the program announced after @entity184 's demise — a heavy - lift rocket system that would launch astronauts in an @entity203 space capsule — would offer immediate widespread job opportunities			1
but the plans announced last year wo n't have unmanned test launches of the @entity207 for another five years , and the first manned mission wo n't be for about another decade			2
private - sector companies , such as @entity213 founder @entity212 's @entity211 , are starting unmanned launches from @entity3 , but their need for workers does n't come close to what was required for the shuttle program			1
last time : the shuttle @entity220 is prepared for its 25th and final spaceflight after 19 years of service ' we expected a little more action from our government , at least in figuring out what direction we 're going to go in , ' said @entity196 , 55 , who worked on the shuttles ' thermal protection system earning about $ 80,000 a year			1
' ultimately , that would inform which direction we would go in			0
a lot of us thought , since we have such deep roots in the community , we could wait it out			0
it was hopeful at first			0
now it is n't so hopeful			0
things are n't moving fast			0
' many of the former space workers find camaraderie and job tips each friday at the weekly breakfast of the @entity243 , a group created by former @entity3 workers			1
just hours before 70 members dined on eggs , biscuits and coffee at a recent meeting , three @entity246 astronauts parachuted back to @entity252 in a capsule halfway around the world			0
for the space workers , it was yet another sign of the growing competition facing the @entity6 as a leader of space exploration			0
at the moment , the @entity6 has no way of sending astronauts to space in its own vehicles , and @entity4 is relying on the @entity117 - made @entity116 capsules to send @entity6 astronauts to the international space station			0
one of the network 's founders , @entity270 , recently joined more than two dozen other colleagues working on a reconnaissance project for a contractor in @entity18 where they are earning six - figure annual incomes			2
@entity270 had been out of work for about a year from his job on the cancelled @entity184 program when he took the one - year contract to work halfway around the world			2
new home : the @entity282 , a full - size shuttle mockup that was on display at the @entity285 for nearly two decades , stands ready for transport by barge to @entity63 , @entity288 ' as the months passed , i began to realize the hard reality that things i had known and taken for granted no longer existed			2
stable work , good pay , benefits , etc. were no longer a reasonable expectation , ' @entity270 wrote in a recent email from @entity18			0
' as time went by and it was getting closer to a year without a job ... the ( @entity18 ) opportunity looked better and better			0
the money was very good due to compensation for hardship and danger			0
' those who have remained on the @entity10 without jobs are cutting back on small luxuries			0
@entity196 has trimmed back on eating out and vacations			0
@entity308 , who worked 27 years at the space center , has cut back on using his car and utilities at home to save money			2
the 60 - year - old 's unemployment benefits are running out soon , and without a new @entity6 space program offering ready - to - go jobs , he is contemplating retirement , something he does n't want to do			1
' i live day to day			0
i ca n't afford new cars or lots of groceries , ' @entity308 said			0
' from where i sit , there is nothing coming online soon enough to resolve my problem			0

@entity3 's workforce of 8,500 is the smallest in more in than 35 years
@entity70 , @entity11 's unemployment rate went from 10.6 per cent in april 2011 to 11.7 per cent in august 2011 as the shuttle program wound down
