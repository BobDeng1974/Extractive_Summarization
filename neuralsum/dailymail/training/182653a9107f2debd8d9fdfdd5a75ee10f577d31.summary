by @entity0 published : 10:09 est , 22 april 2013 @entity2 : 03:53 est , 23 april 2013 she was a healthy medical student whose parents , brother and sister were all doctors			0
but – obsessed with her weight – @entity8 , 23 , was secretly taking a banned and dangerous slimming pill			1
and just when she told her psychiatrist her bulimia was finally under control , the drug , which is linked to 62 deaths worldwide , claimed her life too			1
although banned for human consumption , @entity16 is easily available online – in capsule form – because it is also a pesticide			1
@entity8 , 23 , had complained of feeling hot and unwell and had been breathing heavily on the evening of her death at her inquest yesterday , coroner @entity22 said it was ‘ entirely ’ responsible for miss @entity8 ’s death			1
demanding a crackdown on the sale of the capsules , he said manufacturers knew they were bought for weight control			2
‘ the only motive for manufacturing a toxic substance as a slimming aid would be to profit from people who have the misfortune of having a condition such as @entity8 ’s , ’ he said			1
‘ anyone who professionally manufactures capsules to be taken as a drug has the intention of people using it as a drug			2
@entity8 ’s death is a consequence of that			1
’ @entity16 is sold as a weight loss aid , but has been described as ' extremely dangerous to human health ' by doctors			1
it is sold mostly over the internet under a number of different names but contains 2 , 4 - @entity54			2
it is marketed mainly to bodybuilders as a weight loss aid as it is thought to dramatically boost metabolism			1
the manufactured drug is yellow and odourless and was previously used as a herbicide and fungicide			0
it was launched as a slimming aid in the @entity64 in the 1930s but then banned in 1938 , due to the severe side - effects			0
depending on the amount consumed , signs of acute poisoning could include nausea , vomiting , restlessness , flushed skin , sweating , dizziness , headaches , rapid respiration and irregular heart - beat , possibly leading to coma and death			2
miss @entity79 had taken @entity16 along with a prescription anti-depressant			2
the combination of the two drugs , which both boost the metabolism , may have proved fatal , the inquest heard			0
she was found dead in her bedroom by a flatmate the day after refusing to call an ambulance when she felt hot and unwell			0
her family , who are all qualified doctors , pledged to lobby the government to make @entity16 illegal			1
her father @entity93 , 55 , said : ‘ for those who are selling it , if you have any ounce of decency you must stop			0
‘ the world has lost a bright , bubbly person who would have gone on to making people ’s lives better			0
@entity8 loved life and was passionate about helping others less fortunate than herself			2
’ investigations after her death last september indicated miss @entity79 had taken 38 capsules from a packet of 100 of @entity54 ( @entity16 ) and the drug was detected in her blood			1
there was no evidence of an overdose and she was not suicidal , the hearing at @entity112 was told			0
she had been seeing a psychiatrist for her eating disorder for three years and had improved so much that the sessions were expected to come to an end soon and she was no longer officially bulimic			2
the evening before she died miss @entity79 , a student at the @entity121 , was breathing heavily , had yellow eyes and had two cold showers to try and cool herself down after complaining of feeling unwell			0
she was encouraged to call an ambulance by her flatmate , but insisted the symptoms would pass and it was n’t unusual for her to feel like that			0
miss @entity79 texted a friend the next day but was found later by another flatmate and paramedics called to the address in @entity133 pronounced her dead at 5.15pm			0
toxicologist @entity134 said of @entity16 : ‘ because it is a banned substance , we do n’t really know what would be a safe level to have in the body			2
' the drug affects different people in different ways			0
‘ we have heard of several deaths caused by @entity16 and we know that whatever the dose , it can be life - threatening			1
it is not intended for human consumption and it is a poisonous substance			0
it therefore seems likely @entity16 consumption caused @entity8 ’s death			1
’ dr @entity152 , a forensic toxicologist , said taking @entity16 with the anti-depressant fluoxetine – also known by the trade name @entity155 – may have proved fatal as the effects could have been ‘ exacerbated ’			1
he said : ‘ we do n’t know how long @entity8 had been taking dnp but it may have accumulated in her system			1
it increases the body ’s metabolic rate			0
the side effects can be overheating and breathlessness caused by an increased heart rate and this seems to be consistent with how @entity8 was feeling that evening			1
' @entity164 ' : @entity8 had been battling bulimia but was responding well to medical treatment @entity8 ' unfairly compared self ' to other people but psychiatrist of three years said her state of mind ' had improved significantly ' @entity93 and @entity171 , the parents of @entity8 , outside @entity173 yesterday ‘ at a very high dose @entity155 can have a similar effect to @entity16 and so one can speculate that the two drugs together might have speeded up the effect			1
’ psychiatrist dr @entity178 said miss @entity79 made no secret of her bulimia : ‘ her drive to lose weight was always there and she was fearful of weight gain			1
’ ‘ she was most likely taking @entity16 to satisfy her own need to control her weight , ’ he said			1
‘ @entity8 was a healthy weight , with a body mass index of 23 , and no one knew she had been taking the drug alongside her prescribed anti-depressants			1
’ the medical student had previously been ‘ bingeing ’ twice daily and ‘ purging ’ eight times a day , but this was reduced to an average of once a fortnight			0
‘ she felt like she had the knowledge to combat her eating disorder , ’ he added			0
miss @entity79 ’s father , mother @entity171 , 55 , sister @entity200 , 27 , and brother @entity201 , 29 , are all doctors from @entity203 , @entity204			0
@entity205 , 26 , ( left ) died from a heart attack in 2008 after taking a large amount of @entity16 ( right ) that she had bought online			1
@entity208 , 28 , ( right ) is believed to have taken @entity16 after acquiring it at a local gym			2
he died shortly afterwards last october the family said after the hearing they wanted to make people aware of the drug ’s dangers ‘ so no other family suffer in this way ’			2
they said in a statement : ‘ it seems incomprehensible to us that such a toxic substance can be available in tablet form to be sold in the @entity225 for human consumption across the internet			0
‘ it is perhaps only through her death that the strongest message can come out			0
‘ if anything can be learnt from @entity8 ’s death then that might help little bit in alleviating her loss			1
’ police believe the capsules were imported from @entity239			0
detective constable @entity240 said : ‘ the website does flag up that the product is not for human consumption but by selling it in tablet form , they are knowing full well that it is going to be used for weight loss			2
‘ it will be difficult to ban it outright because it is still legitimately used as an effective pesticide			0
the way to control consumption is through education			0
’ recording a verdict of misadventure , mr @entity22 said he hoped there would be a ‘ campaign ’ to get substances such as @entity16 controlled by law			1
he said he did not believe miss @entity79 intended to harm herself .			0
