the @entity1 government has denied @entity3 's claims that he was an undercover spy and had worked for both the @entity4 and @entity5			1
national security adviser @entity6 has spoken out in the wake of @entity3 's first televised interview that aired on @entity9 wednesday night			1
when asked if @entity3 's claim was true , ms @entity6 bluntly said : ' no '			0
' @entity3 was a contractor working for the @entity5 and other elements of the intelligence community , ' she said to @entity15 's @entity14 after being prompted with another question			2
his side : @entity3 told @entity9 's @entity18 that he previously worked as an undercover operative for the @entity4 and the @entity5 , but the government has since denied those claims ' obviously he â€™s accused of sharing and disclosing , illegally , some of the most sensitive information of the @entity1 government , allegedly , and our strong view is that rather than give television interviews , he ought to come home and have his day in court where he will be treated with all of the protections and fairness that our judicial system allows			1
' speaking out : @entity6 told @entity15 that @entity3 never served in such capacities and he should come back to @entity1 to be brought to court her comments come after @entity39 's full interview with @entity3 aired , wherein he claimed to have had experience working as a government - backed undercover agent in addition to working later as an analyst and contractor for the @entity5			1
' i was trained as a spy in terms of the traditional sense of the word in that i lived and worked undercover , overseas , pretending to work in a job that i 'm not , and even being assigned a name that was not mine , ' he said to @entity9			0
' now the government might deny these things , they might frame it in certain ways and say " oh , well he 's a low - level analyst " but what they 're trying to do is they 're trying to use one position that i 've had in a career here or there to distract from the totality of my experience , which is that i 've worked for the @entity4 - undercover , overseas			1
i 've worked for the @entity5 - undercover , overseas - and i 've worked at the @entity66 as a lecturer at the joint - training academy where i developed sources and methods for keeping our people and information secure in the most hostile and dangerous environments across the world			2
' he went on to claim that before he turned over the documents to journalist @entity78 , he started to go through official channels to report his apparent concern over the @entity5 's surveillance programs			1
more evidence : @entity3 said that he sent emails to his higher ups at the @entity5 before leaking , expressing his concerns , but the government took the unprecedented step on thursday of releasing one email that went against his comments in response , the government used their new @entity91 to released one email that they had on file from @entity3			1
the email is dated april 8 , 2013 , and seems to be an inquiry about the definition of the scope of executive orders as dictated in part of his training			0
' @entity5 has now explained that they have found one email inquiry by @entity3 to the office of general counsel asking for an explanation of some material that was in a training course he had just completed , ' the ic on the @entity110 caption notes			2
' the e-mail did not raise allegations or concerns about wrongdoing or abuse , but posed a legal question that the office of general counsel addressed			0
' @entity3 's email , dated friday , april 5 , 2013 hello , i have a question regarding the mandatory @entity121 training			0
the training states the following : --- - ( @entity123 ) @entity124 is displayed from the highest authority to the lowest authority as follows : @entity1 @entity128 ( @entity127 ) @entity66 ( @entity66 ) and office of the director of national intelligence ( odni ) @entity129 --- - i 'm not entirely certain , but this does not seem correct , as it seems to imply executive orders have the same precedence as law			2
my understanding is that @entity135 may be superceded by federal statute , but @entity135 may not override statute			0
am i incorrect in this ? between eos and laws , which have precedence ? similarly , between @entity66 and @entity143 regulations , which has greater precedence ? could you please clarify ? thank you very much , @entity146 official response , sender 's name redacted , sent on monday april 8 , @entity150 , executive orders ( @entity152 ) have the " force and effect of law			0
" that said , you are correct that @entity158 can not override a @entity160 general , @entity66 and @entity143 regulations are afforded similar precedence though subject matter or date could result in one having precedence over another			0
please give me a call if you would like to discuss further			0
regards , [ name redacted ] office of general counsel full exchange : this email chain was released by a government - run blog on thursday afternoon in an effort to discredit @entity3 's claims that he sent emails showing he was concerned about @entity5 policies			1

@entity3 claimed that he worked for the @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity66 at different points in his career
national security adviser @entity6 has shot down that theory and said that he never worked as a spy for any branch of the government
in his first televised interview , he told how he tried going through official channels by emailing his boss about concerns before leaking
government released one email he sent asking a question about legal precedence - with no sense of concern
