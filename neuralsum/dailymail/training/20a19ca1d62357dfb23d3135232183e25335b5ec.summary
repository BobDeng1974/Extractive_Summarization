by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 remembers the moment he peered out into a filthy grey @entity4 day and saw a gifted young novice blossoming into a superstar			1
it was in the autumn of 2003 and training had finished at @entity12 ’s @entity11 base			1
most of sir @entity15 ’s squad had headed for sanctuary but @entity17 remained out in the elements , running with a ball at his feet , practicing and refining his repertoire of tricks			1
@entity17 may divide opinion for such things as appearing on the front of @entity26 , the manicured good looks , the rippling torso and a perceived desire to be the centre of attention but one thing beyond question is his current standing as the best footballer in the world			1
‘ from day one he had the flash and the flare but there was always something there and his work ethic was second to none , it really was , ’ @entity2 explains			1
‘ that is the one thing i tell everyone who is around him			2
' everyone sees the underwear commercials , the girlfriends and the cars but , trust me , his work ethic is incredible			0
on the ball , in the gym , eating the right food			0
you know , i just remember every day after training it was always the same			2
devotion : @entity17 on the training ground with @entity39 , fine - tuning aspects of his game trademark technique : @entity17 has always put in the extra hours on the training ground in his pursuit of perfection ‘ @entity11 is so big , there are acres and acres , so the perimeter is massive			1
but he would just go out after training and dribble the ball in the rain – doing his step - overs , the ‘ @entity95 ’ turns , all the things you see on television			1
he had n’t honed his free - kick ( style ) back then , that came later			2
‘ but he ’d run with the ball at his feet around whole the perimeter , working on his own			0
it is no secret then			0
it is no surprise that this is how he has ended up			0
’ yet he is also on the brink of elimination			0
this maybe an outstanding @entity41 but another of its headline acts is in grave danger of leaving the party early and @entity17 will be eliminated if @entity39 lose to the @entity113 and @entity44 beat @entity114			1
way back when : @entity17 ( left ) and @entity2 ( right ) along with @entity115 ( second left ) , @entity116 ( centre ) and @entity118 ( second right ) modelling a new kit when at @entity12 top stopper : @entity2 played for @entity12 between 2003 and 2007 @entity17 looked helpless as @entity39 were pummelled 4 - 0 by @entity44 in their opening game and there no doubt the feisty @entity113 , who are thriving under the guidance of one - time @entity41 winner @entity125 , have the capabilities to take advantage of any lingering hangover			1
some would have anticipated the @entity113 struggling in such a demanding group but preparations under @entity125 have been meticulous and @entity2 says the challenge of trying to emerge from what was dubbed a group of death is both invigorating and inspirational			1
perfect start : @entity136 celebrates his early goal in the @entity113 's 2 - 1 win over @entity114 in the opening @entity41 match winning moment : @entity141 ( second left ) heads the ball beyond the @entity114 goalkeeper to hand the @entity40 victory probable line - ups ‘ i think this is what you want from a @entity41 , is n’t it ? it ’s a proper group , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ if you qualify for a @entity41 and expect to get an easy group , you are in the wrong sport			1
it does n’t work like that			0
‘ the @entity113 , have got to play 100 per cent , for three perfect games , to get out of the group			0
if you are in @entity157 or @entity158 , it does n’t matter			0
expectations are high now , soccer is so much more popular in @entity113 and the fan base has got more cult like			0
‘ you used to have the casual fans and now each team has their ultras , different groups and different fan bases			2
with that the expectation on the national team has grown			2
we have gotten better players ; we have @entity125 as coach ‘ our best ever result was reaching the quarter - finals in 2002 and only just losing 1 - 0 to @entity44 , so that 's the benchmark			2
but @entity125 has so many different ideas about the game on and off the field , from having our own chef , to travel , everything			0
he ’s made everything ten times better .			0

@entity2 was a team - mate of @entity17 's at @entity12 between 2003 and 2007
@entity40 goalkeeper will be *tasked* with keeping him out in @entity41 meeting with @entity39 on sunday
@entity2 *reveals* @entity17 's *obsession* with training while at @entity12
