rangers are determined to exhaust every possible avenue in a bid to avoid paying @entity3 £ 500,000 for the five loan players sent north under the instructions of @entity6			1
the small print of the deal emerged on monday as the club posted half - yearly losses of £ 2.89million			1
the accounts also revealed the new board are still searching for a nominated advisor ( @entity14 ) to avoid being de-listed on the @entity15 - and that the club 's auditors @entity16 quit in june in a move that was not revealed by the previous regime			2
@entity23 ( left ) , @entity20 ( middle ) and @entity22 ( right ) pose after their loan moves to @entity0 interim chairman @entity26 described that as a sign of the ' staggering mismanagement ' that had gone on at @entity29			1
but fans have been left aghast at the stunning revelation that should @entity0 win promotion through the play - offs this season they will have to fork out £ 500,000 to @entity3 of the loanees , only @entity20 has seen regular first - team action while @entity36 was injured in his only top - team appearance			1
@entity38 , @entity23 and @entity39 are unlikely to ever appear as they battle back from either illness or injury			1
' it 's another kick in the teeth for @entity0 fans , ' said @entity46 , of the campaigning @entity0 supporters group sons of @entity48			2
20 - year - old defender @entity36 suffered an injury in his one and only first - team appearance for @entity0 ' i think it 's right for the board to pursue this			1
i have faith in the guys running @entity0 now and this is not the only deal they will be trying to unfold and unravel			1
' but it 's a bit of a cheek			0
@entity6 sold the idea as these five costing @entity0 no money			2
but we 've since found out there 's £ 1,000 to be paid each per week , and it 's my belief the club is paying for rental property , too			2
now we find out about this lump sum if we are promoted			0
' the night the transfers went through , we saw the players leaving @entity3 but nobody saw them arrive at @entity74 prior to signing			1
' we 've been questioning for a while the ridiculous decision to not give them medicals			0
had they done that , it would show two were injured and would probably never pull on a blue jersey and a third was ill and could n't play football			0
' the controversial deal was struck by the club 's previous board led by chief executive @entity86 – a cohort of @entity3 owner @entity88			2
@entity89 understands however that the new board are now set to approach the @entity91 and their @entity93 counterpart as they seek advice on whether there are grounds for quashing the £ 500,000 payment clause			1
the bombshell that @entity0 – who would earn just £ 342,000 for finishing second in the league – would have to shell out the cash to @entity3 if they are promoted emerged as the @entity29 club released ' disappointing ' financial results			1
interim chairman @entity26 railed against the previous regime after announcing the near £ 3m loss for the six months to december last year			2
@entity20 is the only one of the five @entity3 loanees to have held down a regular starting spot at @entity109 the 22 - year - old @entity111 midfielder has scored four goals in just eight league games for @entity0 despite promotion to the @entity116 , @entity0 ' revenue fell £ 100,000 to £ 13.1m , though the club earned £ 1.3m from hosting the @entity119 rugby sevens			1
sponsorship revenue also dropped , falling by £ 0.3m to £ 0.4m			0
rangers have until saturday to appoint a new nominated advisor ( @entity14 ) or face being de-listed from the stock market although it 's believed an extension will be sought to that deadline			0
@entity26 , who along with @entity127 and @entity128 ousted the previous board led by @entity6 , said he was confident @entity0 can overcome their difficulties			0
he said : ' the new directors have been in place only a matter of weeks but have already started to repair the damage caused through recent years of neglect and disrespect for this club , its people and its history			0
' the mismanagement of the club in recent years has been simply staggering			0
' as the @entity143 prove , the new board has inherited major problems but while campaigning for change we all knew the club would be in need of major restructuring and repair on all fronts			0
' we can and we will return this club to a strong and profitable footing through strategic planning , investment and re-engagement with all of our stakeholders			0
' too many of them have been lost or disenfranchised because of successive failings by a series of directors over the last four years in particular			0
but they are gone now and this is a new era for this great and special club which must be regenerated , not only for its own good but for the greater good of @entity166 football			0
' defensive midfielder @entity23 has been ruled out of action for @entity0 with a mystery illness			1

@entity0 will try to avoid paying out the £ 500,000 *fee* for the five players loaned from @entity3 earlier this year
the small print of the deal emerged on monday as @entity0 posted six - month losses of £ 2.89 million
of the loanees , only @entity20 has seen regular first - team action while @entity36 was injured in his only senior appearance
@entity38 , @entity23 and @entity39 are unlikely to ever appear as they battle back from either illness or injury
