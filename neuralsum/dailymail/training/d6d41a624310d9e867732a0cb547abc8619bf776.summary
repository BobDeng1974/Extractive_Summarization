by @entity0 published : 19:41 est , 30 december 2012 updated : 19:46 est , 30 december 2012 sex advice : dr @entity2 , the author of @entity3 which published in 1918 , was an instant bestseller and reprinted 39 times in the next seven years deeply embarrassed yet clearly keen to make a success of his marriage , the anonymous correspondent plucked up the courage to ask for advice on a delicate matter : how to make love to his wife			1
‘ for the first four months of our married life i did not know that it was necessary to move my body in any way , ’ he wrote			1
‘ we only know of the one positions [ sic ] in which my wife is underneath			2
now can you tell me of alternate positions and also is my wife supposed to move about ? ’ the letter was one of many sent to @entity2 , the birth - control pioneer and author of @entity3 , a manual with information on physical intimacy that emphasised how husbands should endeavour to satisfy their wives rather than merely expecting them to put up with ‘ it ’			1
the book , published in 1918 , was an instant bestseller and reprinted 39 times in the next seven years			1
young couples and those who had been married for years devoured it			1
though erotic novels had long been in circulation , practical advice for ‘ normal ’ couples was non-existent			1
brides went into marriage woefully ignorant of what to expect , while their bridegrooms were very often equally naive			2
when @entity2 asked her readers to write to her with evidence to support her theory that women had a ‘ cycle ’ of desire — feeling more amorous at certain times of the month than others — she was inundated with thousands of letters from men and women desperate for information about sex			1
the act of ‘ married love ’ did not come naturally for many , and they were acutely aware of their failings			1
some of the letters are touchingly naive , others heart - breaking			2
other men and women were writing letters sharing their sexual experiences , fantasies and bizarre proclivities to magazines such as @entity74			1
these were published alongside racy pictures of chorus girls disrobing			2
an @entity78 academic has unearthed these letters to @entity2 and the risqué magazines , drawing on them for an intriguing new book about @entity84 sex lives between the wars and how people communicated their sexual problems and desires			1
while @entity90 marriages had been largely about wives submitting to husbands — in the bedroom and elsewhere — by the @entity95 many men and women ( at least among the middle classes ) wanted a more equal relationship			1
but they ’d been raised by @entity90 parents reluctant to broach such a distasteful subject , so often had no idea how to do it			2
this was where @entity2 stepped in			1
she had been entirely ignorant about sex before she married			1
highly educated though she was ( she had a doctorate in botany ) , it was not until several years into her marriage that she stumbled across a description of sex in a library book and realised she had never experienced it			1
in 1916 she obtained a divorce on the grounds her marriage had not been consummated — a claim her husband furiously denied — and set about trying to dispel the ignorance that had led her and , she surmised , many others to miss out on this vital part of marriage			2
the reception of @entity3 proved her right			2
though the @entity125 , press and medical establishment were outraged ( couched though it was in coy euphemisms ) , ordinary couples fell on it eagerly , using it as a guide to navigate their way through territory as bewildering as another planet			2
cheeky : edwardian magazines printed revealing shots , left , while @entity2 book , published in 1918 , revolutionised sex for married couples , right one woman wrote that her husband , despite having a biology degree from @entity142 , was clueless as to the geography of the female body , and they ’d been unable to achieve ‘ union ’			1
after studying the book , they pinpointed the vital location and ‘ eventually were successful ’			1
not all sexual impasses could be resolved so happily			2
the war had left many men with physical injuries that made sex impossible			1
others suffered mental trauma that inhibited them			0
one young man wrote to @entity2 that he had been wounded three times during the war , the last time in both legs			1
he had suffered shell shock and two nervous breakdowns but had recovered — or so he thought — sufficiently to get married in 1925			1
sadly , he had been unable to consummate the marriage on honeymoon , and the experience was so off - putting for his wife that she lost all desire for him			0
other men with disabilities worried that their inadequacy would cause the wives to have nervous breakdowns			1
they were mortified and felt ‘ selfish and mean ’ or ‘ like a cad ’ for being unable to fulfil their role			0
perhaps some feared their wives would seek sex elsewhere , like @entity179 in @entity181 ’s novel @entity180			2
for other men , the war had provided an outlet for sexual preferences they had n’t been aware of			2
a sapper wrote to @entity74 of how , while taking part in morale - boosting theatrical performances , he ’d discovered he loved dressing in women ’s clothes			0
one man claimed happy memories of cross-dressing sustained him during a long recuperation from war wounds			0
most refused to see their penchant as effeminate			0
one man who liked wearing female underwear wrote robustly : ‘ nothing namby - pamby in that ! ’ the era also saw the rise of the sporty girl , who cast off the corsets and stays worn by her mother ’s generation and enjoyed hiking and tennis			0
some saw the rise of these modern women as deeply worrying , but for others the image of girls wrestling or boxing was a source of admiration and titillation			0
magazines such as @entity74 obliged by running reports of such matches accompanied by photos of semi-naked girls in the wrestling or boxing ring			0
one woman , calling herself @entity228 , wrote many letters to @entity74 , sending readers ’ pulses racing with descriptions of her underwear			0
in response to multiple requests , she sent in her photo and it was printed			0
but her fans were disappointed by the disparity between the curvaceous figure she had described and the reality			0
one wrote in describing himself as ‘ sadly disillusioned ’			0
in need of help : some men turned to @entity2 's book because they were worried that their wife might take a lover like @entity179 in @entity180 magazines with deceptively anodyne titles catered to more risqué tastes			1
@entity253 ’s @entity252 , for instance , was all about whipping			0
novels were a source of information and titillation			0
in 1919 , nearly a century before suburban housewife @entity258 wrote @entity259 , @entity260 , a pig farmer ’s wife from @entity262 , published @entity263 — a romantic novel about an @entity253 who is kidnapped in the desert by a sheik and spends months being sexually dominated by him until they fall in love			0
the bestseller was made into a hit film starring @entity273			0
people who wanted something more raunchy could visit certain bookshops in @entity277 , though the @entity278 and @entity279 would alert the police if the material being sold was too explicit			0
( presumably , these moral guardians had to read them thoroughly first in order to make such a judgment			0
) many people preferred to get erotic literature from mail - order companies that would deliver it in brown paper			0
most consumers were middle class , as were @entity2 ’ correspondents — at least those concerned about sexual pleasure			1
the working classes , if they could write , tended to have more practical concerns : they wanted information about birth control			1
their mothers were equally reluctant to enlighten them about the facts of life as those in the middle classes			0
one young woman from @entity306 believed that ‘ if a lad kissed yer , you ’d be having a baby ’			0
such innocence seems a world away from our own , rather more sexually confident age			0
making @entity315 — sexual narratives and identities in @entity318 by @entity319 ( @entity320 , £ 18.99 ) .			0
