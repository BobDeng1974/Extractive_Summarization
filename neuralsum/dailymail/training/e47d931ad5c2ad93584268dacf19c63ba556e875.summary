instead it uses a laser to make thousands of tiny holes in the face using the world 's most powerful carbon dioxide laser , through which plasma from the patient 's own blood is pushed using an ultrasound probe			0
and @entity17 , a 42 - year - old beauty therapist from @entity18 has become the world 's first person to undergo the procedure - termed the needle - free ' vampire facelift ' - in @entity23			1
before and after : @entity17 , 42 , before the ' vampire facelift ' , left , and afterwards , right the non-surgical operation was invented and carried out by @entity27 plastic surgeon dr @entity26 at his @entity29 clinic			1
the treatment is so - called because it uses the patient 's own blood - taken from the arm - to make improvements to the skin			0
the plasma from the blood is then extracted and used in the non-invasive procedure , with the aim of rejuvenating the skin			1
the technique is an updated version of the traditional ' vampire facelift ' , which involves a series of painful injections into the face			1
@entity17 , who lives in @entity18 , said : ' i 'm very happy with it - it 's a brilliant result and i would definitely recommend it			1
the procedure makes such a great improvement to your skin in terms of pigmentation , texture and in other ways			2
' @entity56 creates thousands of perforations deep into the skin using the worlds most powerful @entity61 laser on @entity17 she added : ' the laser part was a little uncomfortable but it was very quick , it only took a few minutes			1
some people wo n't like the discomfort but it 's worth it			0
after you 've had a bit of downtime your skin just looks amazing			0
' i decided to have the procedure done because i knew that it would be rejuvenating and i knew i would see results			2
it 's actually a really good procedure to have because its all working in tune with the skin			2
i wanted my skin to be more youthful			0
' @entity17 , who is originally from @entity80 , said : ' quite a few people have noticed a real difference			2
they think i look fresh or that i 've been on holiday			0
it 's a great treatment			0
' @entity26 pushing the blood plasma into the prepared skin of @entity17 , who has had thousands of tiny holes lasered into her face mr @entity26 , who lectures and trains other plastic surgeons all over the world on facial plastic surgery , said : ' the needle - free vampire facelift removes deep surface lines and wrinkles			1
it then keeps on working in various ways under the surface to enable the skin to produce collagen , its own youth serum			0
' these non-invasive treatments are the future and as technology improves , so do the results			0
i wanted to get away from using artificial chemicals and by using a patient 's own fat or blood plasma there wo n't be any adverse reactions and the results look and feel very natural			0
' the results have been great so far and i 'm delighted to have created a new procedure which will push the boundaries of non-invasive cosmetic treatments			2
' mr @entity26 's treatment , which costs around Â£ 750 , offers a less painful alternative to the traditional needle - based procedure .			1
