by @entity0 published : 11:43 est , 30 august 2012 updated : 02:27 est , 31 august 2012 two conmen jailed for a total of 20 years for running @entity4 ’s biggest ever mortgage fraud were ordered to pay back more than £ 30 million today			1
@entity5 , 50 , fleeced banks out of £ 49 million by buying cheap properties , including a cowshed and an abandoned air base , and paid crooked chartered surveyor @entity10 , 43 , to provide false valuations			1
in june 2011 @entity5 was jailed for 13 years and @entity10 was locked up for seven years			1
today they were ordered to pay back a total of £ 30,826,013.86 in one of the largest confiscation orders ever made in the @entity4 or spend a further 16 years behind bars			1
scam artists : @entity5 and @entity10 have been ordered to pay back £ 30m or spend even longer in jail between 2004 and 2006 companies controlled by @entity20 - based fraudster @entity5 and his brother @entity21 , 54 , bought six commercial properties for just £ 5,688,125			1
@entity10 , a director at @entity23 , then provided false valuations in order for the @entity25 to deceive lenders into loaning £ 49,287,000			1
the @entity5 brothers - who sent £ 26m to @entity28 - bribed @entity10 with lavish overseas holidays in @entity30 , an @entity32 car , cash in brown paper envelopes , and the purchase of three properties in @entity37 , valued collectively at more than £ 1m , to aid the massive scam			1
@entity5 continues to deny involvement in the scam and refused to take part in proceedings today			2
anger : @entity5 denies any involvement in the scam and refused to take part in proceedings at @entity46 today judge @entity47 said : ‘ he informs me that he was wholly unaware of the fraud and he was the dupe of two men			2
’ he said that as a result he had ‘ simply no idea ’ where the bulk of the money has gone			0
‘ by me trying to determine what he now has available to him is really trying to pin the tail on the donkey , for all i know mr @entity5 now , as a result of good investment , has assets worth £ 60m , ’ said the judge			1
‘ but , on the basis he shared the profit of this fraud [ with his brother ] i have to conclude that that is unlikely			0
’ the judge ordered that @entity5 pay back £ 29,276,565.91p within six months or face another ten years in jail			1
the court heard @entity5 ’s @entity72 assets are believed to include property in @entity20 , @entity28 , the @entity74 , and @entity75 , and the £ 26m that was sent to @entity28 @entity10 was told he must pay back £ 1,549.447.95 within six months or spend another six years behind bars			1
historic : judge @entity47 laid down one of the biggest confisation orders in history today he was gifted two properties in @entity83 , central @entity37 , valued at almost £ 800,000 , and a third property in @entity85 , north @entity37 , worth £ 326,000 , by the @entity87 on which he earned around £ 50,000 in rent			2
the court heard that after his arrest he had attempted to hide large chunks of his criminal earnings			0
judge @entity47 said : ‘ he did his best to minimalise his offending			0
‘ he was determined to hold on to as much of those dishonest gains as he can time and again since this enquiry began			0
‘ on his first arrest he attempted to move the £ 86,000 he had hidden in @entity37 ’s @entity98			2
‘ second he quickly sold the @entity99 for £ 58,000 and hid the money by transferring it into a bank account set up for the purpose in his wife ’s name			0
‘ after the restraint order was made he diverted money he made as a surveyor into a company ostensibly under the control of his wife			0
’ he said @entity10 ’s benefit was £ 2,792,401.29 , but stated that the realisable assets were just over £ 1.5m			1
jailing @entity5 and @entity10 last summer judge @entity47 described the fraud as a ‘ massive and carefully orchestrated confidence trick ’			1
prosecutor @entity118 said @entity119 had the ‘ productive entrepreneurial role ’ , while @entity5 was involved in the ‘ day - to - day management of banking and other financial matters ’			2
@entity10 abused his position to provide the false valuations which persuaded the banks that the sites were a good investment			2
one 183 - acre site was a former @entity74 airforce base in @entity131 , @entity132 , now known as @entity133			0
it was purchased for £ 2.75million before a mortgage of £ 9.1 million was raised from @entity137 bank @entity136 through a series of front companies			0
the bank ‘ relied on the property valuation provided by @entity141 ’ , while the fraudsters also created bogus leases suggesting the site was accruing significant income from commercial tenants			0
in reality the site was near derelict and home to several families of gipsies			0
the @entity151 was conned when it lent £ 26m against a former @entity153 dairy in @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 ; offices known as @entity158 in @entity159 , @entity160 and the @entity161 in @entity20			0
@entity10 helped raise a £ 6.563m loan on @entity163 , which was later repossessed and sold for £ 650,000			2
the value of @entity153 was inflated to £ 14.25m when it was really worth £ 750,000 , while the £ 700,000 @entity167 premises generated a £ 6.15m mortgage			0
the fraudsters also used @entity10 ’s valuations to obtain £ 11.5m of loans from @entity172 for @entity173 , a 3.5acre site made up of workshop and office units dating back to the 1930s in @entity178 , @entity20 , and worth nearer £ 1m			1
mr @entity179 said the scam had a ‘ very significant impact of the financial health of that building society ’			0
‘ @entity172 had to make provision for a loss of £ 10m which reduced its profit for 2005 from £ 11.7m to £ 1.7 , ’ he told the court			2
@entity5 , of @entity189 , @entity20 , and @entity10 , of @entity190 , @entity191 , admitted two charges of conspiracy to obtain money transfers by deception and four counts of obtaining money transfers by deception			1
@entity119 is thought to be in @entity28 and is still wanted by the @entity199 for his alleged role in the fraud .			0

@entity5 and @entity10 , jailed last year for a total of 20 years , have been told to pay back £ 30m
if they do *n't* do it in six months their sentences will be *increased* by a further of 16 years
