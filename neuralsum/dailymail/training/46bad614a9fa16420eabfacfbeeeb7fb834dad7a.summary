two soldiers were ‘ marched to death ’ in a gruelling @entity3 selection exercise on the hottest day of the year			1
the @entity5 pair were among six men to collapse with heat exhaustion in the @entity9 mountain range			1
all six were flown to hospital where two were pronounced dead and a third was fighting for his life			1
two soldiers died in the @entity9 during a training exercise on what was the hottest day of the year , the @entity16 has said ( file picture ) around 100 @entity5 troops took part in saturday ’s exercise in rugged terrain 2,900ft above sea level , close to @entity23 , the highest peak in @entity25			1
commanders put them through brutal physical trials , including long runs in body armour while carrying weapons , ammunition and battlefield equipment weighing more than 100lbs			2
but , as temperatures hit @entity35 , the casualties started to pile up			0
an @entity37 sea king helicopter was deployed immediately along with a civilian air ambulance to ferry the victims to hospital at @entity41			1
expertise : colonel @entity43 , who commanded @entity45 troops in @entity46 , said the gruelling @entity3 tryout ' push soldiers to the extreme ' last night the tragedy was being investigated by the @entity16 and @entity50			1
the families have been informed			0
an @entity16 spokeswoman said they will not cancel any exercises as a result of the deaths , but would not say whether any extra safety measures had been implemented in the wake of the tragedy			1
she said : ' routine exercises will continue			0
' one @entity5 officer said : ‘ the troops are desperate to prove they are up to joining the @entity3 and push themselves harder and harder			0
they are encouraged to by the instructors who are unforgiving			0
‘ there is going to be a huge inquiry into what happened because on the face of it these lads look like they ’ve been marched to death			0
‘ more should be done to ensure these needless tragedies do n’t occur			0
’ the men , who were seeking entry to an @entity3 reserve unit , collapsed in hills near the town of @entity9			1
a defence source said : ‘ it is a case of the people succumbing to the training that they were doing			1
' we have health and safety procedures in place for everything but that must be balanced against the fact we are training people to go into extremely challenging environments			1
‘ we do n’t go out of our way to kill people but we have to put them in tough situations because that is what they will be facing on operations			2
’ the @entity9 are a notoriously inhospitable area for army training operations and are used by both regular units and the special forces			1
sources indicated the tragedy was caused by heat exhaustion			0
a third soldier remains in hospital the men became ill close to @entity23 , which at 2,900 feet is the highest mountain in @entity25 @entity109 beauty spot : army chiefs say the rugged and sprawling terrain helps prepare soldiers physically and mentally for war @entity115 , mayor of @entity9 , said the town was reeling from the tragedy			1
he said : ' there is a historic link between @entity9 and the armed forces and we 're proud of that			1
in fact , various regiments have the freedom of the county and @entity9 and news like this shakes us to our core			1
' more or less everyone in @entity9 knows someone who has served and the community is shocked by what 's happened , and deeply moved			1
' colonel @entity43 , who commanded @entity45 troops in @entity46 , writes : many times during my military service i have seen just how treacherous the @entity9 can be , especially on the rare occasions of soaring heat			1
this is the ultimate testing ground for @entity45 troops preparing for battle and it is no coincidence that selection for the @entity3 – the toughest training in the world – takes place in these rugged @entity109 hills			2
military combat demands extreme levels of physical fitness and endurance , and nowhere is this truer than in the blistering heat of @entity46 ’s deserts			0
@entity45 troops have fought with enormous success there and to a great extent this is due to arduous training in areas such as @entity9 where fitness , navigation , combat survival and teamwork are tested in near battle conditions			1
soldiers are pushed to the extreme , marching for hours by day and night , carrying weapons , ammunition , battle equipment and a rucksack weighing more than 50lb			2
commanders and soldiers are all taught about the potentially lethal hazards of operating in the heat , which is equally dangerous in training and in actual combat			2
although we do n’t know exactly what went wrong in the @entity9 on saturday , the awful reality is that when troops train for war , tragedy can sometimes strike , however well prepared they might be			1
in january , captain @entity183 was found dead on the mountain range ’s snow - covered @entity185 peak			0
he was taking part in a gruelling 40 - mile march in freezing conditions as part of a selection process for the @entity3 when he collapsed			0
army chiefs say the rugged and sprawling terrain helps prepare soldiers physically and mentally for warfare , as well as putting their logistic , survival and map - reading skills to the test			0
but the uplands can prove dangerous even to the most hardened service personnel			0
major @entity203 , who was involved in contingency planning during the first @entity206 , said it is one of the most challenging terrains military personnel can encounter			0
‘ on one end of the spectrum you have cadets being taken for mountain walking and at the other end of the spectrum the @entity3 use it , ’ he said			0
@entity219 said the dead men , who have not been named , would have been carrying heavy equipment and pushing themselves hard to a deadline			0
@entity224 mp @entity223 , a former member of the @entity5 , said : ‘ nobody should jump to any conclusions here about what may have caused this , but obviously we all know that , for example , people who take part in marathons run a small risk of dying of heat stroke and all sorts of other things , and the @entity239 does train its soldiers very , very hard indeed			2
the training is there for a purpose , and it is arduous training at any level , and sometimes things tragically go wrong			2
’ the @entity5 ’s website says of the @entity9 : ‘ training for high - intensity , light - role war fighting is the way soldiers and officers are prepared for any operational situation they may face – conventional war , counter insurgency , security sector reform , peacekeeping or supporting civil authorities			1
‘ this ensures that the training is as close to current operations and pre-deployment training as possible , whilst maintaining the ability to train for high intensity war fighting			2
’ an @entity16 spokesman said : ‘ the @entity16 can confirm that it is working with @entity50 to investigate an incident during a training exercise on the @entity9 on saturday in which two members of military personnel died			1
‘ more information will be released in due course but it would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage			0
’ the three other men who were taken to hospital were discharged after being checked over by doctors			2

@entity298 , pictured with his step - son , had only recently been stationed in @entity300 when he was shot he had been sent on the grueling exercise with a group of soldiers as punishment for littering			0
on friday , a @entity306 and a corporal were given lengthy military jail sentences after a soldier died when he was shot in the neck during a training exercise , in @entity312 corporal @entity313 and staff sergeant @entity314 have also been thrown out of the army following fusilier @entity317 's death			1
@entity298 , 21 , and a fellow serviceman were manning a general purpose machine gun for more than 100 troops			0

the court heard that @entity313 , 29 , and @entity314 had failed to follow procedure by failing to call an armourer to fix the weapon			0
a judge ruled that the death of the serviceman from the 2nd battalion of the @entity333 had been ' wholly and utterly avoidable ' .			0
