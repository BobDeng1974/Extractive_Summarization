by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 12:15 est , 24 july 2012 updated : 03:00 est , 25 july 2012 each one has poured his heart out to her in their weekly chats at the @entity7			2
but as four of her prime ministers greeted the @entity11 for lunch at @entity13 yesterday there was only one topic of conversation – their delight at helping her celebrate her @entity19			1
as she lined up with @entity21 , sir @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 , the @entity11 ’s smile hinted at secrets kept and confidences held			2
only @entity42 , who is in frail health , was unable to attend yesterday ’s extraordinary gathering at @entity45			1
political rivalries and intrigues may have been put aside for the day but officials still muttered darkly of a ‘ seating plan from hell ’			2
cabinet secretary sir @entity51 and deputy pm @entity52 were expediently placed to provide ‘ buffer zones ’ to limit any tensions across the table			1
@entity24 , who was making his first visit to @entity13 since leaving office , has had awkward relations with both mr @entity23 and mr @entity52 , and was seated between dame @entity59 and sir @entity51			1
the @entity11 was flanked by mr @entity21 and sir @entity22			0
mr @entity21 ’s wife @entity62 and mr @entity52 ’s wife @entity63 were the other guests			1
mr @entity21 meets mr @entity23 at the door to 10 @entity13 mr @entity24 and his wife @entity66 pose with the @entity31 at the door before going inside for lunch mr @entity21 welcomes mr @entity22 , the last @entity68 pm before him , to @entity45 the @entity31 pose with mr @entity22 and his wife @entity69 at the door to @entity45 after drinks in the @entity13 study , they tucked into a starter of salmon , main course of roast duck breast with potatoes and seasonal vegetables , and a dessert of trifle			1
her majesty ’s blue patterned dress and hat were the height of fashion			0
@entity89 ’s £ 495 dress , by cutting - edge designer @entity90 , was exactly the same shade			0
the rather public fashion faux pas was unlike the prime minister 's wife who , as a member of the @entity96 , rarely puts a well - clad foot wrong when it comes to matters of style			1
as their husbands mr @entity21 and prince @entity32 stood awkwardly by their side the two women posed together in the sunshine , and while @entity62 smiled happily for the photographers the @entity11 's stony face told a very different story and it was clear that the monarch was not amused			0
a spokesman from @entity111 confirmed today that there are no rules when it comes to choosing an outfit when meeting the @entity11 , and the @entity116 never makes the colour of her clothing known before an event			0
but the wardrobe clash will be an embarrassment for the brunette who is known for her immaculate styling			0
as well as being startlingly similar in colour both outfits featured a digital style blue and white print			0
the @entity128 rarely sets foot inside @entity45			0
mr @entity21 is thought to be only the sixth of her 12 prime ministers to invite her to such a gathering			2
mr @entity23 threw a dinner to mark the @entity136 , attended by sir @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity42 , and sir @entity22 .			1

guests ate salmon to start , then a main course of duck , and trifle for dessert
deputy prime minister @entity52 and wife @entity63 attend , but @entity42 unable to make it *due* to ill health
