by @entity0 that @entity1 was a paedophile is known			1
but in a devastating book - serialised in the @entity4 this week - labour mp @entity0 exposes the industrial scale of his debauchery and how the @entity7 , @entity8 , police chiefs and even @entity10 covered it up			1
@entity12 , mp for @entity1 ’s old @entity14 seat , reveals how the 29 - stone monster was saved from prosecution time after time ... after spending many months wading through abuse , despair and wretched politics in pursuit of @entity1 , i had just about gone as far as i thought possible			1
i was n’t sure if i had the stomach to deal with much more — when a key piece of the jigsaw i ’d almost given up on finally turned up			2
i got access to the police files on @entity1			1
no more lies : in his new book , @entity27 mp @entity0 exposes how the @entity7 , @entity8 , police chiefs and even @entity10 covered up @entity1 's sexual abuse i was in a restaurant in @entity31 when i first got sight of them			1
they were placed in front of me by a journalist , and i put the menu down and started to devour every word			0
there was plenty there that i already knew , having pieced it together from other sources ; but there was one section that quickly grabbed my attention			2
@entity47 had succeeded @entity1 as mayor of @entity14 in 1967 and was the leader of the @entity50			1
during the police investigation into @entity1 at the end of the 1960s , he was interviewed by detective sergeant @entity55			1
@entity47 offered some robust advice to the police regarding the prospect of charging @entity58 with child abuse			2
protected : @entity1 , pictured with fellow @entity61 @entity60 , @entity62 and @entity63 , was ' allowed ' to continue his abuse despite police trying to investigate ‘ may i offer a personal opinion , ’ he began			1
‘ i sincerely hope that this matter is not prosecuted before the court			0
in my opinion , as a @entity70 , it is not court worthy			0
‘ the prosecution can do no good at all , and the backlash will have unfortunate repercussions for the police force and the town of @entity14			1
it is no secret that @entity1 and i are buddies , and not only politically			1
’ in other words , the leader of the local @entity8 was threatening the police			2
notes from detective sergeant @entity55 underneath this account acknowledge as much			0
‘ the veiled threats and innuendoes contained therein , ’ he remarks , ‘ reflect @entity47 ’s general attitude to this inquiry			0
’ i ’d already known that @entity1 was leaning hard on the police , but i did n’t know that the local @entity8 was doing the same			1
what ‘ unfortunate repercussions ’ for the police could @entity47 possibly have had in mind as he tried to bully them into dropping their investigation ? ' the door was open ' : his victim says he will never forget how @entity1 , pictured with then @entity8 leader @entity62 in 1977 , abused him in the @entity101 reading on , it quickly becomes apparent that @entity55 has doubts about @entity14 police			1
referring to evidence of @entity1 ’s abuse given by the council ’s children ’s officer , @entity107 , @entity55 casts doubt on whether @entity14 ’s chief constable @entity110 ever acted on it			1
‘ it is quite feasible , ’ he notes , ‘ that mr @entity110 would keep it to himself because of the status of the man involved			0
’ as he found he could get away with his abuse , @entity1 began to take more risks , as @entity117 testified			1
a member of the @entity119 based at @entity120 in @entity121 in the @entity122 , @entity117 got in touch to share what was an open secret at the time			0
‘ @entity1 was into young boys , we all knew that , ’ he said			1
‘ we heard plenty of stories about him			0
’ these stories would be shared at the @entity132 bar where @entity117 and his fellow @entity119 officers socialised with the @entity134 , whose police station was in @entity136			2
‘ the @entity138 officers explained how they carried out observations and arrests in the male public toilets in the park , close to the junction of @entity144 and the @entity145 , ’ he said			0
‘ these toilets were a regular meeting place for homosexuals and young male prostitutes after dark			0
’ on a number of occasions police officers had detained @entity1 after he was caught ‘ in acts of gross indecency with young lads ’ at these toilets			1
on each occasion , they ’d been told by those higher up the chain of command to discontinue their inquiries due to the status of the individual concerned			0
how many times had @entity1 been arrested or pulled in by police only to be released as soon as the phone call from high office was made ? i wondered if he actually got a thrill out of being caught — knowing they could n’t pin anything on him because he was a protected man			1
the files also offered clues to the defence that @entity1 was prepared to give if the matter went to court			1
under questioning , he tried to claim he was in loco parentis where the boys abused at local schools and hostels were concerned			1
they were on his property , and in all matters medical and relating to general discipline , @entity1 claimed the boys had signed off legal responsibility for him to care for them			1
in other words , he could do whatever he wanted			0
detective inspector @entity55 knew only too well that no court in the land would buy this			2
‘ in my opinion , ’ he wrote , ‘ it is without merit			0
it will not withstand even superficial examination			0
’ concluding , @entity55 seemed confident of a prosecution			0
under questioning , @entity1 ‘ had difficulty articulating , and even the stock answers he offered could only be obtained after repeated promptings by his solicitor ’			1
unfortunately , the @entity206 did not share the same confidence			0
in a letter to @entity210 in 1970 , @entity206 sir @entity208 said he did not consider there to be a reasonable prospect of a conviction			0
referring to the statements by @entity1 ’s victims , he said : ‘ the characters of some of these young men would be likely to render their evidence suspect			2
’ it may as well have said that as long as a high - profile politician decides to abuse boys of lowly social status , then there is zero chance of him being prosecuted			2
it more or less outlined a code of conduct for abusers			0
stick to vulnerable people from broken homes and the law will give you a wide berth			0
the injustice contained in these words is as strong now as it was then			0
it was a loophole so huge that even someone as gargantuan as @entity1 could skip through			2
