a couple who refused to let a gay couple share a bedroom at their seaside guest house have won permission to take their case to the @entity9			0
@entity11 judges earlier this year dismissed a challenge brought by the couple who run a guest house in @entity16 , against a ruling that they breached equality legislation when they turned away a gay couple			0
the appeal court had upheld the january 2011 verdict of judge @entity24 at @entity25 that @entity26 and @entity27 , who run @entity29 in @entity30 , @entity16 , had directly discriminated against the couple , who were awarded a total of £ 3,600 damages			1
@entity26 and @entity27 from @entity30 , @entity16 , run @entity29 ( pictured ) @entity26 and @entity27 ( pictured left ) refused to let @entity36 and his civil partner @entity35 ( pictured right ) share a double room in the hotel that they run			1
the case is to be heard by the @entity9 the @entity9 , the highest court in the land , has now decided to hear the @entity27 ’s case			2
mr @entity43 , 72 , and mrs bull , who is in her late 60s , are @entity46 who regard any sex outside marriage as a ‘ sin ’			2
consequently , they would not let @entity36 and his civil partner @entity35 share a double - bedded room			1
the @entity52 denied that they had discriminated against the couple , arguing that their policy of only allowing married couples to sleep in a double bed , in accordance with their religious beliefs , was applied to everyone , regardless of sexual orientation			1
they said they had also prevented unmarried heterosexual couples from sharing double rooms since they opened 25 years ago			2
in february this year , sir @entity64 , @entity65 , sitting with @entity66 and @entity67 , dismissed the case and said the restriction was ‘ absolute ’ when it came to homosexuals but not heterosexuals			0
@entity26 and @entity27 said they refuse to let unmarried couples share double rooms , in accordance with their @entity46 beliefs he said : ' in those circumstances it must constitute discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation			1
such discrimination is direct '			0
lady justice @entity67 said a homosexual couple ' can not comply with the restriction because each party is of the same sex and therefore can not marry '			0
the @entity52 had accepted an £ 80 - a - night double room booking , believing @entity35 , 38 , would be staying with his wife			1
when mr @entity35 arrived with his 46 - year - old civil partner @entity36 , the men , from @entity25 , were told they would not be able to share one room and instead had to sleep separately			1
@entity36 ( right ) and his civil partner @entity35 ( left ) were awarded £ 3,600 in damages in january 2011 @entity26 and @entity93 say they did not discriminate against the couple because they were homosexuals in january last year judge @entity24 ruled at @entity25 that the @entity52 had breached equality legislation and ordered them to pay the couple a total of £ 3,600 damages			1
in the @entity103 ruling earlier this year , @entity67 said : ' whilst the appellants ' beliefs about sexual practice may not find the acceptance that once they did , nevertheless a democratic society must ensure that their espousal and expression remain open to those who hold them			0
' however , in a pluralist society it is inevitable that from time to time , as here , views , beliefs and rights of some are not compatible with those of others			0
' as i have made plain , i do not consider that the appellants face any difficulty in manifesting their religious beliefs , they are merely prohibited from so doing in the commercial context they have chosen			0
' the @entity127 , had backed mr @entity35 and mr @entity36 in their action			1
@entity129 of the @entity127 said “ we believe that this case will help people to better understand the law around freedom of religion			0
' when offering a service , people can not use their beliefs , religious or otherwise , to discriminate against others			0
' but @entity138 , of the @entity139 , which funded @entity35 and mrs @entity52 ’s appeal , said : ' something has gone badly wrong with our equality laws when good , decent people like @entity26 and @entity145 are penalised but extremist hate preachers are protected			2

@entity26 and @entity27 said that they did not discriminate on the grounds of sexual orientation
they claim they do not let any unmarried couples share a room , in accordance with their @entity46 beliefs
when @entity35 *initially* booked the £ 80 a night room , the @entity52 believed that he would be sharing with his wife
