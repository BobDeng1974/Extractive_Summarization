journalist @entity0 who , after being profoundly deaf for several years , regained her hearing thanks to a cochlear implant my hands were shaking as i dialled my husband 's number			1
it had , after all , been almost ten years since i 'd last heard @entity9 's voice			1
' @entity11 , ' he said , sounding just as he had the first time we met , at a party in 2000			0
we both started to laugh with joy , so loudly that i nearly missed hearing him say : ' i love you			1
' those words usually passed between us in sign language			0
i had been profoundly deaf for several years , and we had come to rely on signing to communicate			1
@entity9 's voice was n't the only sound i 'd missed desperately in that time			1
i missed hearing my dad play his violin , the splashing of water in a shower , even hearing myself sing			1
i could hear when i was born but began to go deaf in my teens			1
as i approached my 40th birthday last summer , i was somewhere between profoundly and totally deaf			1
but the flick of a techno - switch on the cochlear implant fitted in my skull finally transported me back to a lost world ; a place where cats purred , sirens screeched and pebbles clinked on the beach			1
although my deafness is genetic and runs through generations of my family , in my 20s i remained in denial			0
i had a degree , friends , boyfriends and a career as a journalist , scriptwriter and actress			1
audiology tests were an advance warning but i refused hearing aids ; i just wanted someone to turn up the volume			1
by my late 20s , denial had turned to despair			0
like all deafened people i would bluff when i could n't hear and swiftly change the subject of conversations i could n't follow			1
as a journalist , i was winging my way through interviews with a tape recorder customised for my failing ears			1
at night i performed my own material in nightclubs , and at literary events that were noisy i reckoned no one else could hear much either			1
but i sensed impending doom and clung to friends , fearful that soon i 'd be unable to hear them			1
romance was hard , too			0
you ca n't go on a casual date when small talk is impossible			0
when i met @entity9 , an engineer , through friends , he had to learn sign language to get to know me			1
even in the early days when we still communicated verbally , whispered sweet nothings were tricky			0
@entity0 said : ' my implant bleeped and squeaked as it began finding the right frequencies , but i did n't care			1
i was overawed ' i hated weddings because i was surrounded by people i loved but could n't understand			1
so when it came to my own wedding , we ' eloped ' to a register office in @entity88			1
we 've left it a bit late to have children			0
if we ever do , there is a 50 - 50 chance our son or daughter will go deaf when they grow up			1
but at least they will have the chance to hear again , thanks to cochlear implants			1
it was around the time our relationship became serious that i stopped being able to use a phone			0
hearing aids saved me for a while , making the most of the dwindling sound i could pick up , but i had to lip - read in tandem with them , which i found crushingly exhausting			2
by 2008 i was in shock , feeling the last remnants of my hearing self slipping away			2
even with hearing aids , the only sounds i could discern were muffled , as if i were under water			2
inside my head was a cacophony of small noises from tinnitus , the result of my brain making up sounds of its own			0
it is a common misunderstanding that deaf people live in silence			2
about dating when deaf @entity0 said : ' romance was hard , too			1
you ca n't go on a casual date when small talk is impossible ' i often felt isolated and moody , and focused on my career			0
i toured with my plays , wrote scripts , even founded a theatre company			0
i had radio plays broadcast and played @entity136 in the @entity138 series @entity139			0
it was in 2011 that my audiologist suggested i might be eligible for a cochlear implant			1
this would mean inserting electrodes into my cochlea - part of the inner ear - to send signals to my brain , enabling me to hear again			2
i would have a small headpiece and a processor over my ear , the receiver a tiny computer set into my skull			2
but there was a risk : if the implant failed , it would destroy any tiny bit of hearing i had left			1
the biggest terror , however , was daring to hope			0
i had the 90 - minute operation in july this year			2
i had to wait 30 days before the implant could be switched on to give the wound time to heal and the device a chance to settle in			2
@entity9 was working on the day i had to go back to hospital , so my mum and sister came with me			1
they are both deaf and do n't have implants			2
a doctor once told my mum she should get sterilised to avoid passing on the deaf gene			2
@entity0 's mother @entity173 , who also went deaf as a teenager because we grow up hearing and then go deaf , my family are proud of both parts of ourselves			1
none of us expected to hear again , so what has happened to me in the past month has been an incredible journey for us all			2
when the doctor turned on the implant , i felt like a radio being tuned			2
at first all i could hear were computer noises			2
then i heard my own voice , followed by my mother 's ; the sound of my childhood			2
' i was so excited at the idea of being an ordinary wife on the phone to her husband , i thought i might burst with joy ' my implant bleeped and squeaked as it began finding the right frequencies , but i did n't care			1
@entity9 had taken two weeks off to care for me after surgery but then had to go away for work			1
as soon as i left the hospital after my switch - on , i called him			0
i was so excited at the idea of being an ordinary wife on the phone to her husband , i thought i might burst with joy			1
those first few days were far from perfect			0
people 's voices veered from @entity206 to @entity207 , with special effects by @entity209			0
but i gorged myself on sound : everything from @entity213 's @entity212 to synthesiser music			0
it was everyday sounds that made the most difference			0
i could telephone my friends			0
i could hear the radio , tannoy announcements , the doorbell ringing , my own footsteps			2
after just ten days i was at the stage most people reach at six weeks , and was delighted when an audiology test gave me slightly below - normal hearing			0
i thanked my specialist , then burst into tears			0
in the pyramid of human need , communication comes first and music is a luxury , but i had rediscovered both and it has been life - changing			0
in the three weeks since then , my sense of reawakening has grown exponentially			0
i 've been stunned at how chatty people are			0
i love talking to strangers			0
i have music on my ipod - friends have given me their playlists from the past decade or more , so i can catch up			0
people say things as they walk away , with their backs turned - and i hear			0
life feels faster , warmer , more connected			0
people ask me if a cochlear implant is a cure			1
when i take my headset off at night , i return to total deafness			0
in fact , my brain has stopped making noise for itself so my quiet is quieter than it has ever been - for which i am very grateful			0
when i was deaf , i used to have dreams in which i could hear			1
now , if i have such a dream tonight , i will wake tomorrow knowing that it has come true .			0
