if i were the @entity2 manager there would n’t be a moment ’s doubt about what to do next with @entity6			1
leave aside , just for a moment , questions of morality or whether his ban is long enough and what is going on is his head to make him do these extraordinarily bad things			2
purely and simply from a football perspective , what he does for you on the pitch — and i do n’t mean biting people - makes him indispensable			1
and with the season @entity2 have ahead of them , that ’s truer than ever			1
they had a brilliant 2013 - 14 , pushing for the title when many people thought they might struggle to get into the top four			2
although they did n’t win it , they were superb , with @entity6 the single most significant reason for that			1
so that ’s the football decision			2
it ’s an easy one to make			2
but if i were the chief executive or the money man at @entity2 , i ’d have him up for sale already			1
the issue is one of risk and what might happen in the future given a pattern of behaviour			2
keeping @entity6 may potentially cost @entity2 tens of millions of pounds			1
perhaps £ 70million or more			1
how so ? if he went somewhere else this summer — @entity62 , i guess , with @entity63 and @entity64 showing recent interest and having the money — @entity2 cash in on their biggest asset			1
yes , it will be a tough ask to replace such quality , but if all the proceeds and more were re-invested in a proven striker , it might make sense			2
if @entity2 do n’t sell him and he bites someone else after his ban ends , he could he thrown out for years			1
madness : @entity6 was charged with biting someone for the third time in his career tooth ache : @entity6 goes down holding his front teeth @entity6 certainly made his mark on this @entity83 , albeit in regrettable fashion			1
unfortunately this tournament will now be remembered as the one where @entity6 bit someone			1
amid all his goals and game - winning performances , the statistic that stands out in his career is being banned for dozens of games in total for biting people			2
speaking to @entity32 fans here after the incident , the general feeling is of support and love for @entity6 because he gives so much for the team on the pitch and is a great player			1
family time : @entity6 holds his children as he greets fans from their home 's balcony on the outskirts of @entity109 in @entity32 support : @entity32 have backed @entity6 and will appeal the decision the solution to the @entity6 situation could be that if @entity63 do want him , i ’d demand @entity115 in a swap deal			1
i was n’t watching the @entity32 - @entity118 match but saw a mention on social media as soon as the incident happened			2
for a few moments , i could n’t believe he ’d done it again			0
i thought it must be an old joke or a wind - up			0
then the videos and photographs started flowing online			0
it ’s just incredible behaviour , baffling			0
i was just about at the point where not only did i think of @entity6 as a fantastic player but that he ’d rid himself of the devil inside and left all the rubbish behind			1
but one chomp later it ’s obvious he ’s still @entity136			0
playing for keeps : @entity137 says @entity138 should try and keep hold of @entity6 @entity140 man : @entity6 helped @entity2 almost win the title last season key man : @entity6 was named player of the year by both the players and the football writers within a fortnight he ’s gone from a hero who can barely run but still manages to mastermind the beating of @entity149 , to a pariah banned from all football for four months			1
the punishment , like the man himself , will polarise opinion			0
he had to be punished			0
he has n’t got off lightly			0
neither would i argue with those who sincerely feel he should have been banned for longer			0
what he did is just inexplicable			0
i have three young kids and they asked me about what happened			0
‘ @entity161 , why did he bite that other player ? ’ we do n’t know , do we ? he evidently has some demons to handle when he ’s on the pitch , sometimes			2
by all accounts he is a good team - mate and decent bloke away from it			0
tough battle : @entity137 says @entity6 is one of the best players in the @entity40 ‘ he did a really bad thing , he was naughty , ’ is how i explained it to my children			1
‘ he ’s going to be punished			0
he wo n’t be allowed to play football or even go to games for a while			0
’ but of course they already know it ’s bad to bite people			0
is his problem surmountable ? nobody can say			0
we all thought after last season that he was a changed man			0
he ’s created a huge dilemma now for @entity2 and i do n’t envy them the decisions ahead			1
@entity137 is an interviewer , programme - maker and football expert for @entity191			0

@entity6 is indispensable for what he does on the pitch
@entity6 could be sold for up to £ 70m and that could be too big to resist
if @entity63 want to *buy* @entity6 then @entity2 should try and get @entity115 as part of the deal
