the 21 - year - old came in for some criticism after favourite @entity7 hit the front in the @entity9 at @entity10 on saturday but was ultimately beaten a head by the rallying @entity12 , who was winning the race for the third year			1
there was an irony in the outcome as the winner was ridden by @entity18 , who operated as @entity0 ' main jockey last season			1
@entity0 has called for patience around jockey @entity2 @entity2 was beaten tiding @entity7 in the @entity9 at @entity10 on saturday the win was @entity18 's most important since deciding to go freelance rather than revert to the @entity26 jockey job he had previously held behind former @entity0 ' stable jockey @entity27			1
@entity0 said : ' if @entity2 rode @entity7 again , he would do things differently			1
it is the first time he has ridden him in that situation and you never stop learning			1
it wo n't be happening next time			1
' he has n't got that much experience riding in those very big races			1
when you appoint a young jockey you have to accept these things			2
he is a good lad			2
' we are all competitive and do n't like giving races away but he will learn from it			2
@entity27 made plenty of mistakes when he was riding			2
' sometimes these talented horses are n't straightforward			2
@entity7 wants a more competitive field where he can get a bit of cover			2
he is a monkey but a very talented monkey			0
' @entity7 will now be freshened up for the @entity50			0
@entity0 added : ' he will not run before the @entity51			1
that is the only race i am aiming him at			0
' @entity7 is 12 - 1 for the @entity51 with sponsors @entity54			0
the @entity56 - trained 7 - 2 favourite and last season 's winner @entity59 could run in february after undergoing a breathing operation in the aftermath of his disappointing comeback third in @entity64 's @entity63			0
@entity18 ( left ) took @entity12 to victory ahead of @entity7 at @entity10 on saturday @entity18 was the main jockey under @entity0 last season , before @entity2 had the role meanwhile , @entity0 has three of the 10 possibles for the @entity70 @entity69 at @entity71 on @entity72 with @entity2 on @entity73 and @entity74 on favourite and his 2013 winner @entity76			1
if the going continues to dry , they could be joined by @entity79 ( @entity80 )			0
@entity81 says he hopes to be fit to ride @entity83 ' @entity82			0
@entity81 has not ridden since a fall on @entity84 in the big handicap chase at @entity50 on december 13			0

i have been having physio and fingers crossed i will be there			0

@entity0 *understands* @entity2 needs time as main jockey
