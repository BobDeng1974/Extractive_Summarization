the ' pinch - and - zoom ' feature now used on most smartphones and tablets is particularly under threat following the patent infringement battle			0
scorched earth : @entity79 was said to promise ' thermonuclear war ' against @entity39 after then - ceo @entity76 ( right ) was on @entity0 's board when @entity39 released their @entity70 software but it was unclear whether @entity38 and @entity40 were discussing a broad settlement of the various disputes between the two companies , most of which involve the burgeoning mobile computing area , or are focused on a more limited set of issues			1
competition between @entity39 and @entity0 has heated up in recent years with the shift from pcs to mobile devices			0
