click here for all the statistics , heat maps and goals with @entity5 's @entity4 there was an air of nostalgia at @entity9 on sunday			2
by the end of a disappointing loss against @entity14 , @entity11 supporters were yearning for bygone glory days			1
sadly , though , it ’s crystal clear the club ’s current crop are some distance away from embarking upon a glory era of their own			0
in short : @entity11 threw this match away in six seconds			2

their supporters taunted @entity14 manager @entity23 with chants of ‘ you ’re getting sacked in the morning ’ after @entity53 handed the home side a first - half lead			1
but @entity23 had the last laugh as both his half - time changes — @entity70 and @entity68 — played crucial roles in a stunning @entity14 comeback			1
@entity70 equalised , just six seconds after the restart , while @entity68 laid on @entity27 ’s winner , all before the hour mark			1
‘ to start the second half by conceding in the first action — a stupid goal , ’ lamented @entity11 manager @entity115			2
‘ it was a shock because after that , it all changed in this moment			0
' seven or six seconds before , all was happiness and there was good energy in the stadium			0
‘ in this moment , i think it was difficult to manage in our head			0
our heads had gone and we started to take rash decisions on the pitch			0
’ it was @entity23 ’s astute decision making that turned this game on its head			0
substitutions change football matches but in this case , they may have saved @entity23 ’s job			0
@entity53 scores the game 's first goal at @entity9 to give @entity11 a 1 - 0 lead against @entity14 @entity11 's @entity53 's header finds its way towards the goal with @entity14 goalkeeper @entity62 looking on @entity53 's header gave @entity11 the lead but they could n't hold on to the advantage at home on sunday where did @entity27 come from ? @entity14 beat a host of @entity154 clubs to sign the 21 - year - old from @entity156 for £ 1.5m			1
why was there so much interest ? sixteen goals in @entity154 ’s second tier alerted the @entity161 and others			0
how has he done at @entity14 ? his headed winner broke a goalscoring duck after seven substitute appearances			2
and that won him a start ? well , he was at the front of the queue when @entity172 failed a fitness test before the game			0
@entity23 must have been delighted with him ... he was , and here ’s what he said : ‘ he ’s a really great individual talent			0
the players love him so they were really made up he scored the winner			0
’ after issuing a half - time rollicking to his side for their inept opening 45 minutes at @entity9 , the under - pressure manager threw on @entity70 and @entity68 in an attempt to stir a revival			1
‘ we were giving too much possession to @entity11 , too much space , ’ said @entity23			2
‘ we never made a challenge			0
and we were fortunate to come in at 1 - 0 , so i reminded them about the fundamentals of a @entity37 game and we came out with a much stronger attitude			1
‘ there were a few strong words			0
it ’s not nice as a manager to go in and bark out orders but sometimes it ’s necessary just to shake people up because we needed shaking up			0
’ and it all started so well for the home side , as they dominated the opening exchanges , in terms of possession at least			0
@entity51 ’s half - volley from distance proved the highlight of a drab opening 15 minutes , as @entity11 failed to turn their possession into goalscoring opportunities			1
it took 18 minutes for them to fashion a clear - cut chance — and with it came the opening goal			1
@entity64 did well to block @entity52 ’s fierce shot , but he was helpless to prevent @entity48 pouncing on the rebound to stand - up an inviting back - post cross that @entity53 nodded past goalkeeper @entity62			1
@entity70 of @entity14 scores his side 's first goal to equalise against @entity11 on sunday @entity70 had been told to step up by manager @entity23 and the striker replied with a goal to make it 1 - 1 at @entity9 it took @entity70 only six seconds to equalise for @entity14 after coming on as a half time substitute @entity70 and @entity14 team - mate @entity68 celebrate as the @entity233 club got themselves back into the game in the second half @entity70 and his team - mates celebrate equalising against @entity11 as @entity14 made it 1 - 1 after half - time mins @entity239 @entity11 total 122.3 76.0 @entity51 90 13.0 8.1 @entity48 90 12.3 7.7 @entity43 90 11.8 7.4 @entity14 total 122.4 76.0 @entity29 90 12.8 8.0 @entity63 90 11.7 7.2 @entity71 90 11.6 6.2 data courtesy of the @entity241 , the @entity242 of the @entity37 @entity243 fired wildly over the bar after @entity51 and @entity49 combined to set - up the left back , as @entity11 put their foot down			1
@entity45 then thought he should have been awarded a penalty as he crossed paths with @entity69 , but referee @entity82 dismissed @entity11 protests , and rightly so after replays showed contact — if any — was made outside the box			2
@entity52 wasted a good chance in the final moments of the first half — volleying @entity51 ’s free kick over the bar when he had ample time to take a touch			2
@entity115 would have been satisfied with his side ’s first - half display , if not overjoyed			2
with more cutting edge and creativity , @entity11 should have been out of sight			2
@entity23 knew it too , as @entity68 and @entity70 replaced the ineffective @entity69 and @entity265			0
straight from the kick - off , @entity29 found @entity70 , who steamed past @entity42 down the left , and then neatly finished across @entity41			1
@entity115 showed little emotion on the home bench , but he must have been furious			0
his side , who had looked so comfortable in the first - half , were now firmly on the ropes			0
so goodness knows what he was thinking when @entity14 took a 58th - minute lead when @entity68 ’s cross from the left was glanced home by @entity27 , who was making his first league start for @entity14 after seven appearances from the bench			1

@entity115 threw on midweek hat - trick hero @entity47 and @entity50 in the hope of salvaging something from the game			0
