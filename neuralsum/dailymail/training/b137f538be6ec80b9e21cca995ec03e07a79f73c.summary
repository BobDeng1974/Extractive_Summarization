by @entity0 published : 04:32 est , 30 september 2013 updated : 03:28 est , 4 october 2013 @entity1 has released a total of eight @entity4 handsets since 2007 and each one has been released with the promise of faster speeds and improved performance			1
but how different is the original model to the current @entity10 ? fan site @entity11 has created a video test of all eight handsets , from the original to the new model , plus the @entity16 , @entity17 , 4 , @entity18 , 5 and @entity19			1
each of the handsets were ' freshly restored and not jailbroken ' meaning they each had the same default settings and all applications were force closed beforehand			0
@entity1 's new software has been slammed for causing users to feel sick			0
features on software including zooming screens and app windows , full - screen slide transitions , a ' faux - @entity33 parallax effect ' on the home screen			0
as the phone is tilted , the icons appear to move independently from the wallpaper			0
stuff magazine investigated the effects these motion - based features had on users and discovered claims of nausea , motion sickness and even vertigo			0
in the first test , all the phones were powered off simultaneously and the @entity17 shut down fastest , followed by @entity16 , then the 4 , then the original model			1
the newer handsets all took noticeably longer than the older models , but took exactly the same amount of time as each other , to the second			0
the voiceover explained during the video that @entity57 had a much faster shut down time than @entity58 and this was highlighted in the test			1
each of the phones booted up at different times , but @entity11 highlights that the models differ in the amount of processing power and @entity67 and software between the newest and oldest phones , meaning this was not unexpected			1
the newer models all booted up first , and at almost the same time , yet the original phone booted up faster than the @entity4			1
@entity1 's @entity16 was the slowest to boost			2
fan site @entity11 has created a video test of all eight handsets , from the original to the new @entity10 model , plus the @entity16 , @entity17 , 4 , @entity18 , 5 and @entity19 , pictured			1
each of the handsets were ' freshly restored and not jailbroken ' meaning they each had the same default settings and all applications were force closed in the final tests , @entity11 launched the @entity83 , and @entity1 websites			2
the male voiceover explained that the @entity10 loads sites ' instantaneously ' adding : ' the extra processing power and the new @entity89 capabilities , its an amazing device '			2
when launching @entity83 , the @entity91 beat the 5 and the voiceover continued the loading times go ' downhill ' from there			0
in conclusion , the video maker claimed : ' i learnt that the amount of processing power is greater as the generation goes on , but it 's marginally less noticeable the higher you go , so if you have a 5 i would n't really recommend upgrading to a @entity10 just based on the fact you want extra amount of power , because it has an amazing amount of power as it is			1
' in the final tests , @entity11 launched the @entity83 , and @entity1 websites , pictured			0
during the video , the voiceover explained the @entity10 loads sites ' instantaneously '			2
when launching @entity83 , the @entity91 beat the @entity19 but the rest of the handsets loaded the page slower than its successor in a separate test , @entity116 , a provider of protection plans for gadgets , compared five smartphones , including @entity1 's new iphones , to see if they could withstand drops , dunks and other common hazards			2
it found that while the @entity19 and @entity10 scored similar on the ' @entity128 ' scale , the latest models are n't as durable as last year 's @entity91			1
the biggest loser , however , was @entity131 's @entity130 , which failed to work after being submerged in water and being dropped 5 feet off the ground , according to @entity134 - based @entity116			0
the phone that withstood @entity116 's torture test best was @entity138 's @entity137 new research by @entity116 reveals that the @entity10 & 5c were outshone by their predecessor , the @entity91 , and the @entity130 .			0

@entity11 tested the @entity142 , @entity16 , @entity17 , 4 , @entity18 , 5 , @entity19 and @entity10
all handsets were tested based on shut down and boot up times
the video shows the original model booted faster than the @entity4
