shock : mourners gather to leave flowers at the spot in @entity11 , @entity5 , where @entity2 was stabbed ' but what has n’t changed is the attitude which is still prevalent , where you get to a stage where it ’s quite okay to actually kill somebody			1
' it ’s about changing people ’s attitudes			0
we need to stand together and say " this is n’t good enough , we do n’t want to live in a society where people kill each other - we do n’t want to live in communities which are blighted by violence "			0
' this latest death make me even more determined			0
we have achieved great things and the actual figures have gone down , for whatever reason			0
