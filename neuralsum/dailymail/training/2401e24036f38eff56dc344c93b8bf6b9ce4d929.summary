a village school which has six members of staff on its payroll despite having no pupils has been branded a ' fiasco '			1
all the children have now left the small , rural @entity7 in @entity8 following an ' inadequate ' @entity10 inspection in april yet a cook , two teaching assistants , a cleaner and a secretary – all being paid a full - salary – join the headmistress @entity15 every day			1
@entity16 of the @entity17 called the situation a ' complete fiasco ' and said that taxpayers would be ' baffled '			0
@entity21 in @entity8 has no pupils but six members of staff he added : ' it does n't take a rocket scientist to work out that a school without pupils does n't need any staff			1
' the process of closing the school , and reassigning these staff to places where they can actually contribute to a child 's education , must be sped up			2
' adding to the odd situation , @entity39 , who took over the running of @entity7 , have suggested in a ' consultation on closure ' document , that that the school may stay open for another seven months			2
trouble started at the small school near @entity48 , @entity8 , when it was put under ' special measures ' after inspectors who arrived on april 30 at half a day 's notice found ' there are too many incidents of racist and homophobic bullying , together with some serious instances of violence towards one another '			1
@entity39 , who took over the running of @entity7 , have suggested in a ' consultation on closure ' document , that that the school may stay open for another seven months the news shocked and confused the quiet community because there were only 13 pupils at the school and they were all white			1
but the chairman of governors at @entity7 , has claimed the report was based on a single incident of children using the word ' gay ' as a throwaway comment and not knowing what it meant			0
she said she believed that @entity10 had an agenda against small schools and suspected they 'd been unfairly labelled racist because racism and homophobia were treated as one category by @entity10			1
since the damning report every one of the pupils enrolled has now been taken out of the school			2
by september there were just two pupils left , and within the past month that number has dwindled to zero			2
parents of children at @entity7 have described the @entity10 report as ' ludicrous ' a @entity39 spokesman said : ' despite a positive recent @entity10 monitoring visit , unfortunately the school now has no pupils attending			1
' as a result the council will begin a consultation on the future of the school from october 27 which runs until 21 november			1
' we 're exploring options with staff about how we might be able to deploy them to other schools when close - down procedures have been completed			0
' in doing this , we have to follow @entity109 law and their employment rights by consulting with staff and working with them to look at what their options might be			0
' @entity7 is centred on a single main street , though there are many scattered dwellings on the periphery			0
there are two pubs in the village although the school has no pupils , there are still people in the area who would prefer it to stay open			2
@entity129 , the 63 - year - old owner of the @entity130 , @entity7 is one of them although he chose to send his children , now in their thirties , to a different school			0
he said : ' it would be a real shame if the school ceased to exist completely as it was once at the very centre of village life			0
' however i agree that they should n't be paying all six members of staff to keep it open			0
' it probably only needs the headmistress to complete whatever tasks still need to be dealt with even without any pupils			0

@entity21 put under special measures after @entity10 observed ' racist and homophobic *behaviour* '
at the time of @entity10 visit @entity21 in @entity8 had 13 pupils
all of the pupils have been subsequently removed , last leaving in september
council begun a consultation on the future of the school on october 27 and it will run until 21 november
