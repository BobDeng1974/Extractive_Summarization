' the 17 - year - old was spotted on hospital wards at the @entity18 in @entity11 wearing a name badge and a stethoscope , and even reading patient notes			1
there have also been numerous sightings of him on the grounds of @entity26 in the city wearing scrubs , an identity lanyard and stethoscope			1
he has also been seen in the city posing as a doctor and offering first aid to the general public but police are currently refusing to identify him because of his age			2
although it is not believed he has come into contact with any patients , police said they are anxious to speak to him			2
the state health department has now circulated a situation report to some hospital staff warning them about the ' bogus clinician , ' who was expelled as a @entity51 volunteer earlier this year for inappropriate behaviour			1
the memo said he had been spotted on wards at the @entity5 on at least three occasions since october			1
he was reported to be confident , versed in medical language and terminology and thus highly plausible unless pressed about his identity			2
the memo notes that he has ' not to date committed substantive offences , but should he make physical contact with a patient , posing as a clinician , this would constitute criminal assault '			2
the @entity69 first warned @entity26 about his activity in late november and the information was subsequently circulated to nursing directors and security			0
spotted : the teen was recognised on hospital wards at the @entity18 in @entity11 wearing a name badge and a stethoscope , and even reading patient notes on that same day a staff member reported seeing him walking away from the hospital , wearing scrubs , an @entity26 lanyard and a stethoscope			1
the following day two more reports of possible sightings were made , one passing the level two pain clinic and one at the main entrance passing admissions			0
security staff have been ordered to apprehend the youth and escort him to the hospital 's executive suite should he be sighted again			0
hospital security is liaising with @entity69 investigations and providing cctv and statements where necessary			0
because the youth is under the age of 18 , he has not been named for legal reasons			0
@entity15 is a 2002 biographical crime film in which @entity14 plays @entity105 , who , before his 19th birthday , successfully performed cons worth millions of dollars by posing as a pilot , a doctor , and a parish prosecutor			0
charlatan : parallels are being drawn between the teen and conman @entity105 , played by @entity14 in film ' @entity15 '			0
