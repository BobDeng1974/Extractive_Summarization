by @entity1 reporter published : 12:17 est , 4 january 2013 updated : 13:38 est , 4 january 2013 a number of leading @entity4 artists including @entity5 have lost tens of thousands of pounds after investing in a failed @entity7 restaurant and hotel			1
the @entity9 was launched in a blaze of publicity by celebrity offal chef @entity12 , but went into administration after a series of high - profile misfortunes			1
while the premises has remained open under a new owner , its ' ambassador shareholders ' such as ms @entity5 and fellow artists @entity20 and @entity22 have lost their investments in the venture			1
failure : the @entity9 was founded by offal chef @entity12 , left , and @entity5 , right , was one of many well - known investors in the venture the 15 - room hotel was spearheaded by mr @entity12 , known as the ' king of offal ' , and its restaurant was so well - regarded that it was awarded a @entity33 star in the autumn			1
but a delay in the opening date , ongoing building work outside its @entity40 building , and the slump in the hospitality industry during the @entity43 meant that it was forced into administration in october , the @entity35 has reported			1
the company that owned the hotel , @entity47 , sold the business to a @entity50 tycoon , and the hotel and restaurant are both still open			1
full details of the saga emerged for the first time in a report to creditors drawn up by administrators @entity59 and @entity60 , of corporate restructuring firm @entity61			2
the document shows that shareholders — many of them ' well known ' friends of the founders — stumped up a total of £ 2.25million to back the development , on what was the site of fish restaurant @entity70 ’s			2
loss - making venture : @entity73 in @entity40 , @entity74 , has gone into administration @entity12 , founder of @entity77 restaurant in @entity78 , is famed for his ' nose to tail ' style of cooking			1
when the hotel opened he described it as ' cheeky in a nice way ' , with a bar that would serve all night and a kitchen ' like an 18th century man o ’ war ' , adding : ' the spirit of the place is " yes "			0
' but the administrators ’ report reveals that the owners had already suffered a disastrous catalogue of setbacks since first drawing up their plans in 2007			0
they hired staff and took guest bookings for christmas 2010 after the builders said the hotel would be ready in time			0
@entity33 star : but the well - regarded restaurant was not enough to stop the company going into administration in fact it was not fit to open until april 2011 , and even then , further ' snagging ' problems meant that only half of the rooms could be used			1
as a result the hotel lost £ 1.4million in its first trading year			0
in addition , @entity114 council ’s lengthy makeover of @entity40 meant that ' builders ' materials and site waste was regularly found outside of the premises , and at times the only view from the restaurant windows was that of the construction works			2
' the restaurant was also unable to use its outdoor seating terrace			0
tough economic conditions , exacerbated by the ' negative impact ' on restaurants caused by the @entity43 , pushed the hotel into insolvency on 19 october , after the directors decided they did not want to provide any extra funding			2
involved : @entity22 , left , and @entity20 , right , also invested in the venture before its failure the hotel is now out of administration under its new ownership			1
it has remained open and traded profitably since october , with occupancy rates close to 90 per cent			1
however , a £ 2.98million shortfall at @entity140 means the original shareholders are unlikely to get their money back			2
they also included gallery owner @entity143 , ceramicist @entity145 , @entity147 painter @entity146 , @entity149 heir and art collector @entity148 , and writer @entity151			0
@entity152 said they were being ' very supportive ' despite the probable loss of their investments			0
he added : ' they are all grown ups , no one put in millions or hundreds of thousands			0
' the rest of the @entity77 restaurant group was unaffected by the administration , he said			2
' everyone is quietly working through what has been a very difficult process to protect jobs and suppliers			0
the restaurant is still cooking well and the hotel is busy			0
it has improved the streetscape and it will still be a happy and successful building in 10 , 20 , 30 years time			0
' the new owner is @entity172 , a @entity50 hotelier who also owns a venue converted from @entity174			0
he bought @entity9 for an undisclosed sum .			1
