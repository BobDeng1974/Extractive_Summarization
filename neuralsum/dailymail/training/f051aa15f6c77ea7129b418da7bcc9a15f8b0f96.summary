the riddle surrounding the woman who was discovered in @entity2 nine years after going missing took a bizarre twist today after police cast doubt on claims she 'd ever been kidnapped			1
@entity7 and friends of @entity9 â€“ now 25 - have repeatedly told how their loved one was abducted by her abusive @entity2 boyfriend , drugged and smuggled across the border , aged just 15			1
they say they have had absolutely no contact with her until she finally got in touch in mid-september , revealed she had split up with the older man she had gone to @entity2 with and was now married with three children and was working on a farm in an undisclosed location			1
@entity21 : @entity23 police today said @entity9 never told them when she was found in september that she had been drugged and smuggled across the @entity2 border by an abusive boyfriend contradiction : @entity27 of the @entity28 wipes a tear from her eye as she and @entity31 talk about raising funds to bring @entity9 back			1
they are hurt by claims doubting @entity9 's story of her ordeal aided by the local church , her aunt @entity37 has launched a $ 5,000 fundraising campaign to help bring @entity9 , her husband and the three young girls back to her home in @entity43 , @entity44			1
they hope to have her back in weeks after filling out all the necessary paperwork			0
she has been in regular @entity48 contact with @entity9 for the last seven weeks - when her long - lost niece first made contact			1
yesterday she described the moment she saw her niece on a computer screen for the first time in nine years			0
she said : ' i cried for an hour			0
' but @entity23 police force seemed to contradict the family 's version of events , saying @entity9 left with her older boyfriend @entity62 voluntarily - or at least that is what she told them at first			1
they added @entity9 had spoken to her mother @entity66 days after she was ' kidnapped ' and told her she was ' fine '			1
she also apparently told her mother she was not going to reveal where she was going			2
@entity66 then apparently indicated to police the pair were probably going to ' flee to @entity2 ' , according to the statement			1
her mother is believed to now be living in @entity70 and has had no contact with her daughter since her re-emergence			0
detective captain @entity74 said : ' for the past several years @entity75 have heard rumors that @entity9 was in @entity2 , was married and had three children with her husband , who was not the boyfriend she left with			1
' @entity74 added : ' this week the @entity80 was made aware of a fundraiser that will take place at @entity83 in @entity43			0
' we were told that the fliers being passed out articulated that @entity9 had been kidnapped , drugged and abused in @entity2 with her first husband			1
' this was not the information @entity9 related to law enforcement when we talked to her in september of this year			1
the statement went on to explain police also made contact with @entity9 on @entity48 yesterday to ask her about the allegations			1
memories : @entity9 , center , with her brother @entity96 , left , sister @entity97 , and mother @entity66 , back			1
@entity9 has yet to speak to her mother since being discovered by a missionary in september call for help : police say they issued the statement questioning the version of events after they saw fliers for a soup drive spelling out @entity9 's shocking ordeal it said : ' we asked her about the information being reported ... that @entity9 told officers that in 2004 she left @entity23 voluntarily with @entity62 and ended up at a party somewhere in the @entity115 / @entity114 area			1
' she said while at the party she thinks someone may have drugged her as the next day she woke up in @entity2			1
' @entity9 offered no explanation why she did not tell us this several months ago when we skyped with her			1
' the @entity119 will work with the @entity120 and family in an attempt to return @entity9 and her family safely to the @entity124 once she returns to the @entity124 we will discuss with @entity9 the circumstances of her leaving @entity23 with @entity62			2
' today 's statement came just hours after the two @entity9 family friends championing @entity9 's safe return told @entity129 how they believed @entity62 had spiked a bottle of @entity131 , drugged @entity9 and smuggled her across the border			1
the family say @entity9 texted her elder sister @entity97 on the night of the party , saying , ' he wo n't let me come home '			1
there is still a warrant out for @entity62 's arrest relating to an alleged sexual assault on a minor , which happened just weeks before the pair disappeared			0
the police and the family and their friends are at odds over another claim			2
@entity27 and @entity31 , of the @entity148 , also told how @entity9 had reached out to police in @entity23 five years ago , but officers dismissed it as a hoax			1
family : @entity9 , left , with her siblings @entity97 and @entity96			2
they had recently moved to @entity23 when she disappeared after their father 's tragic death from cancer vanished : @entity9 and her family lived above this bakery in @entity43 when she struck up a relationship with @entity62 , described by her friends as a ' sexual predator ' , who claim he should have been arrested when social services became aware of the relationship in 2004 @entity27 said : ' @entity62 was a sexual predator and @entity9 was kidnapped			1
people ask why she did n't escape sooner considering she was in three different relationships and escaped @entity62 , then another abusive man , but no one knows the real situation			0
' she was only a child when she was kidnapped and after years of mental and physical abuse , maybe she did n't have the strength to try to get away			0
' also , she did contact the police five years ago , but they thought it was a hoax			1
i do n't know what the circumstances were			0
maybe the man she was with found out and pressured her into not going through with it			0
' but the fact she tried to reach out and failed will have knocked her confidence as well			0
the family are obviously very frustrated that the police did n't believe @entity9			1
' when asked about the people in the community who doubt @entity9 's story , both @entity27 and fellow fundraiser @entity31 are obviously extremely upset			2
@entity27 said : ' @entity9 's childhood was n't perfect and @entity66 did n't have all the assets that maybe she needed , but it is very frustrating that we have to deal with all these sharks who are trying to doubt what happened			2
' all we want is to get @entity9 back where she belongs , back in @entity43 with her family			2
we appreciate anyone who wants to help , but we are not begging			0
' she added : ' we all warned her about @entity62 , but he was older and was probably telling her everything a 15 - year - old girl wanted to hear			1
but the authorities should have stopped it			0
when social services got involved they told the family to move half an hour away to @entity23			2
' that does not seem like good advice to me			0
what they should have done is arrested @entity62			0
' @entity9 was always a little girl , but she was a fighter and when she realized something was wrong that night in @entity115 she would have put up a struggle , that is when we believe @entity62 drugged her			2
' but it is not just the police who are skeptical about @entity9 's abduction story			2
@entity222 , who owns the bakery below the @entity9 's family apartment in @entity43 said she knew the family very well			2
and she is in no doubt that @entity9 left of her own accord			2
she also said @entity66 struggled to look after @entity9 , @entity97 and their younger brother @entity96 , after her husband died of cancer when @entity9 was five			2
@entity222 said : ' her husband had died and @entity66 was n't really a great mother			0
the town pretty much took care of them			0
people in the town think she just took off with @entity62			0
' most people do n't think she was kidnapped			0
i personally did n't think she had been			0
i talked to her all the time because she helped out here after school and she was n't happy with the situation with her mother			0
reunited : @entity9 , pictured with her siblings and uncle , has completed the paperwork and hopes to be back with her family in @entity44 by @entity248 ' her mother had a boyfriend at the time , a younger guy who came to live with them			1
for a while he was n't working at all and she did n't like that			0
also , her mother did n't like @entity62			0
i thought he seemed nice and it seemed to me he gave her more stability than she got at home			0
' @entity9 made contact with her family after a church missionary told the @entity259 that she had been spotted			1
the honor - roll student at @entity261 weighed just 98lb at the time and had been working as a field laborer in @entity2 under a new name , after escaping two abusive relationships			1
miss @entity9 apparently escaped from @entity62 but ended up with another violent man who fathered her first child			0
at one point he beat her so badly that she was taken to hospital , where someone helped her get a new identity , ms @entity31 , who works for @entity28 in @entity43 , said			0
her aunt @entity274 said that with no proof of her identity , and unable to speak @entity277 , miss @entity9 struggled to contact her family			2
she worked in fields and later married and had two more children			0
since making contact with her family she has barely left her home in @entity2 , because she is apparently scared of reprisals from @entity62			1
that is also the reason why her relatives will not reveal her exact location .			0

@entity9 was found by church missionary three months ago in @entity2 with three children and a husband
family and friends told @entity129 she was drugged with a spiked bottle of @entity131 at a party and taken against her will nine years ago
she was aged just 15 and fell for ' abusive ' 22 - year - old boyfriend
but police today said she went there *freely* and even called her mother two days after going on the run to tell her ' she was fine '
she contacted police and family over @entity48 in september saying she wanted to go home
