normally picking a united @entity2 team is tough because so many players have compelling claims for inclusion			0
ahead of the 223rd derby , though , that certainly is n't the case			1
with @entity9 admitting @entity11 's play has been ' a little bit broken ' and @entity12 accepting @entity14 's defending has been ' poor ' both managers have issues to address ahead of the crucial game			1
it also means @entity18 has a job trying to come up with the best combined 11 from the players who are expected to be available on saturday – you will not see those in the treatment room figuring below – but it wo n't stop us			1
our formation is 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ... @entity14 shot - stopper @entity26 makes a flying save during their @entity29 clash against @entity30 goalkeeper - @entity26 this has not been the @entity33 's finest week , with errors against @entity35 and @entity36 , but eight days ago he was outstanding in the @entity29 win over @entity30 and is generally in better form than @entity39 , who has looked short of confidence too often of late			1
@entity42 international @entity41 has proved one of the signings of recent years for @entity14 , offering an oustanding threat going forward and helping his side out defensively whenever he is needed right - back - @entity41 @entity12 said he will give the @entity42 international every chance to prove he is able to play and his faith is unlikely to be misplaced			1
@entity41 offers a persistent outlet down the flank and defends as though his life depends on it			1
he gives more going forward than @entity11 's @entity54			2
@entity56 's injury means he ca n't be considered			0
@entity57 , left , has been thrown in at the deep end for club and country but has not looked fazed for either central defenders - @entity57 and @entity62 an unexpected pairing , perhaps , but valid reasons for their selection			2
@entity66 has caught the eye playing for @entity68 and would not be flustered by the big game atmosphere			0
@entity62 , meanwhile , remains @entity11 's best central defender and his importance to the team has been shown in his absence			1
he also provides a goal threat at set pieces			0
others who play in this position at @entity78 and @entity79 simply have n't been good enough so far			0
@entity80 captain @entity62 is @entity11 's best option at centre - back and also chips in with a few goals left - back - @entity84 @entity86 would undoubtedly have his backers but you know what you are getting with @entity84 ; reliability at the back and going forward , terrific dead ball delivery and experience			1
@entity86 is still adjusting to @entity96 football and does n't defend as well as @entity84 yet			2
@entity84 , left , is the obvious choice at left - back in our @entity99 after excelling for @entity12 's side since joining the club from @entity103 for a fee of £ 5million in the summer of 2007 holding midfield - @entity105 and @entity106 @entity105 is a player that every team needs , a 7 out of 10 performance , almost every week and he has been one of @entity14 's top performers so far			1
the questions , here , will come over @entity106 , whom @entity9 staunchly defended on monday			2
some will ask why he gets in , so here are the reasons : if , say , you want a last minute penalty converting or a pass delivering at the right moment , @entity106 remains the man to do it			2
@entity105 , right , shows his mettle during a midfield battle with @entity124 's @entity123 last year despite coming under fire recently @entity106 remains the man @entity11 will turn to in a time of need right midfield - @entity129 one of the first names on this teamsheet			1
growing in stature with each week , a crucial cog in the engine room and the @entity68 international 's progress is showing no signs of stopping			0
he is versatile , too , and can operate in other roles if required			0
the versatile @entity129 , centre , has established himself as a key part of @entity9 's midfield attacking midfield - @entity143 the most improved player at @entity79 in the last 12 months , @entity14 are better when he is in the team			1
works relentlessly , uses the ball intelligently and has the knack of popping up in the right areas at the right moment to score goals			0
@entity14 may have started the campaign slowly but that is not something you could level at him			2
@entity158 attacker @entity143 has started the season superbly with three goals in the @entity161 left midfield - @entity163 when this @entity165 international gets in the mood , he is exciting to watch , his speed and skill can befuddle defenders			0
in his first @entity2 derby , he terrorised @entity11 for 45 minutes until he was the victim of reckless tackle from @entity172			2
good from set pieces and scores goals , does n't appear to showing any lingering fatigue from his @entity177 exertions			0
@entity163 has been a thorn in @entity11 's side when he has played in @entity2 derbies in recent years centre - forward - @entity182 the most unusual pick ? you may have anticipated @entity182 getting into this team but not as a centre forward			1
needs must , however , and this why he would fulfil the role			0
for starters , @entity190 may not be fit after his thigh problem			0
secondly , @entity193 has not been good enough , ditto @entity194			0
then , with @entity14 , @entity195 has not yet done enough , while @entity196 has had fitness problems			1
that is why @entity182 , with his explosive pace , dazzling skill and three goals to his name already , has to lead this line			0
it might be an unorthodox position but it is one in which he has the tools to thrive			0
@entity182 , left , gets the nod ahead of the likes of @entity193 , right , @entity190 and @entity14 forward @entity195 following a series of stunning displays for @entity11 and at international level @entity217 's a star anywhere in the world - @entity9			1

@entity11 host @entity14 on saturday *afternoon* for the 223rd derby
@entity182 starts *upfront* in a 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 as @entity193 , @entity195 and @entity190 fail to make the cut for our combined @entity99
@entity26 gets the nod over @entity39 to play between the sticks
@entity105 joins @entity11 skipper @entity106 in central midfield
the full - back positions are an all - @entity14 affair as @entity41 and @entity84 *occupy* either flank in defence
@entity14 win the *pre-match* battle with seven of their players in starting @entity99
