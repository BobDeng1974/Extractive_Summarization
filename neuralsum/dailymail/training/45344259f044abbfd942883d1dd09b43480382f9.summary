a growing number of stores across the nation are stocking their shelves with an unusual item – @entity5			1
after the recent stream of disturbing news reports of people eating others ' flesh , @entity6 has released bullets that promise to ‘ make dead permanent			0
’ the ammunition , branded as @entity14 offers @entity16 bullets , is live ammunition , but is actually only intended for use on targets – not people			1
the ' bath salts ' sold under the name @entity46 are likely to be stimulant drugs such @entity48 or ephedrine			0
' @entity51 salts ' does not refer to a single chemical , but instead to a range of synthetic drugs that can be sold legally in the @entity55 as long as they are not marked for human consumption – hence the misleading name			1
drugs such as @entity48 are highly potent stimulants , similar to some amphetamines , and in @entity48 's case particularly , cause a strong compulsion to ' redose ' with more of the drug			1
in high doses , such drugs can cause violent and unpredictable behaviour , and terrifying hallucinations – and the compulsion to take more of the drug continues , even once the ' high ' has begun to make the user feel bad			1
various different compounds use the name ' cloud nine ' , and it 's still not confirmed which exact chemical was in the drug reported to have caused these attacks , but some reports have pointed the finger at @entity48			1
the chemical is already illegal in @entity79 – although other ' bath salts ' remain perfectly legal in the state			0
‘ we decided just to have some fun with a marketing plan that would allow us to create some ammunition designed for that … fictional world , ’ he told the radio station			1
mr @entity34 noted that the bullets are some of the ammunition company ’s most popular products			1
the news comes as two more cannibal attacks have been reported in the @entity55 as police warn of a dangerous new mind - altering drug called @entity46			1
last week @entity96 - who is believed to have taken the over-the - counter ecstasy - like drug - growled at officers as he chewed off most of a homeless man 's face before being shot dead by @entity104 police			1
since then two further incidents have been linked to the substance , which is part of a new line of ' bath salts '			0
the second occurred on saturday when a snarling homeless man , identified as @entity32 , threatened to eat two officers , echoing the @entity104 attack			1
a third incident took place in @entity115 where @entity29 , 43 , bit off a chunk of his victim 's face			1
@entity104 police have issued a warning about @entity46 and told their officers to exercise extreme caution when dealing with homeless men who appear to be acting unusually			2
police investigating the case of @entity96 , who ate the face off a homeless man , say as well as being naked , he was carrying a bible			1
some pages had been ripped out of the book and were found close by , according to @entity131			0
a preliminary toxicology examination has also found that the 31 - year - old had been smoked cannabis shortly before the incident			2
they were forced to fit 21 - year - old @entity136 with a @entity138 - style mask after he was arrested for disturbing the peace in @entity141			2
when put in a police cruiser @entity136 slammed his head against the plexiglass divider and shouted at officers , ' i 'm going to eat you ' , @entity142 reported			2
he then growled , gnashed his teeth and tried to bite the hand of an officer attempting to treat his head wounds			0
' @entity32 growled and opened and closed his jaw , slamming his teeth like an animal would , ' the report said			0
@entity104 police said they believe he was on a cocktail of drugs , including @entity46			2
in a second case @entity29 , 43 , is accused of attacking @entity162 at his home in @entity164 , @entity115 , over the weekend after he became upset following a domestic issue			0
victim : @entity162 , though in shock , managed to spray his attacker in the face with wasp spray to stop him from eating any more of his face scene : @entity173 was attacked while working on the yard outside his home in @entity164 , @entity115 @entity176 reported that mr @entity162 was working in his front yard when he was attacked			2
@entity164 assistant police chief @entity178 said : ' during the attack , the suspect bit a chunk of the victim 's face off			1
' mr @entity162 reportedly managed to spray @entity29 in the face with wasp spray to stop him from eating any more of his face			2
@entity29 then allegedly left the home and went to another man 's home where he held him at knife point and stole a hand gun			1
this is where police found him and arrested him			2
a friend of the victim said she believes @entity29 was under the influence of @entity46 , which is the same drug which is believed to have been taken by the ' @entity96 ' @entity96			2
@entity199 ate the face of homeless man @entity96 in @entity104 last week and a police memo to officers has highlighted the dangers surrounding the drug 's use			1
it warned the @entity136 case ' bears resemblance to an incident that occurred in the city of @entity104 last week , when a male ate another man 's face '			1
' please be careful when dealing with the homeless population during your patrols			0
' police have suggested @entity199 was under the influence of the synthetic stimulant usually sold in drug paraphanelia shops			1

the drug , which is also as @entity230 in the @entity55 , comes in harmless - looking packets , police said , adding that it is illegal in @entity233 and @entity234			1

the series of shocking incidents began on may 26 when a naked @entity199 encountered his victim , 65 - year - old @entity96 , who was sleeping in the shade on elevated train tracks			2
in surveillance footage from the nearby @entity255 building , @entity199 was seen struggling with the naked homeless man , throwing him to the ground and then tearing into his face with his teeth as cars and bicycles sped by			1
about 18 minutes into the attack , an officer appeared on the scene and yelled at @entity199 to stop , but the 31 - year - old just growled at him and continued chewing @entity267 ’s face			1
the officer then opened fire on @entity199 , shooting him to death			0
