a photographer has lifted the lid on a famously unexplained light phenomenon that appears in an area of the @entity4 known as the @entity6 's @entity5 locals in the @entity9 hills say they have seen the light and heard the tales of it all their lives			1
the name of the area is the title of the series , created by artists @entity18 and @entity20 , - but the mysterious apparition itself is known to the townspeople in southwest @entity4 as the @entity24			1
@entity24 appears as a basketball - sized orb of light , but only every so often and only by chance on a road called @entity30 , where the rolling @entity32 hills disappear into the endless flatness of @entity34 and @entity35			1
meanwhile , the cause of the light -- which hovers in the sky and is seen to change colors as it moves towards and away from the viewer -- remains a mystery			1
even the @entity78 once tried to pinpoint the cause of the floating orb			1
they traveled to the area outside @entity66 , a town now known as the 2011 site of a devastating @entity85 tornado , to study the @entity24 in the early 1940s			1
they were unable to come to any conclusions			0
guesses as to its origins run from everyday expulsions of gas from the areas abundant shale deposits to ufos			0
denizens : the area where the @entity24 is colorful even without the lore			1
some locals believe its the ghost of a @entity101 soldier , while others say it is an @entity104 spook isolated : the isolated locals manage a living in rural @entity107 , where everyone seems have a version of the @entity24 story @entity111 : the series points toward parallels between the @entity116 area 's haunting anomaly and its denizens ' struggles to remain in the light , here on @entity121 and beyond ' an authentic guide by @entity123 ' : called the @entity125 by this guide , the phenomenon occurs on a rural stretch where the @entity9 flow into the endless , flat stretches of @entity34 and @entity35 many names the @entity24 can be found south of @entity66 , @entity4 , a town now better known as the site of a devastating @entity85 tornado in 2011			1
the anomaly is variously called the @entity24 , @entity24 , @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity6 's @entity24 , @entity134 , and others			1
many legends like folklore anywhere , the legend of the @entity24 and its origins varies each time its told			1
some maintain the light is the torch of a beheaded @entity143 or @entity104 in search of his lost head			2
according to another origin tale , the orbs are the spectral remains of the mutual murder of a native man and a white farmer in the woods			2
others legends say the light is the ghost of a @entity156 soldier or that of a decapitated miner			2
no explanations despite an attempt in the 1940s by the @entity78 to study the @entity24 , it 's true origins remain a mystery			1
some say the lights are the result of gases emerging from the abundant shales in the area			2
others blame reflected car headlights , though official reports date back to an 1881 publication called @entity133 , well before motor vehicles began passing through the area			2
luminescence from rotting organic matter has also been fingered , as have @entity178			0
one form while the name and explanations vary , all those who see the @entity24 report it as an orb or several orbs that float on the horizon and can appear to move quite quickly			1
it is described as being able to change colors from blue to red to gold			1
' its very spooky , ' said local @entity190			0
' it looks like a light way far off , and then its right on you			2
' @entity190 said she saw the light as a kid when she and her parents were lured to @entity30 out of curiosity			2
' my heart was just pounding and it was up in my throat and i thought my head was going to explode and my hands got all cold , ' she said			0
local legend has it that the first to see the lights were the local @entity143 , and some stories saw the light is actually the tormented spirits of two quapaw lovers run off a cliff by an angry chieftan			1
other folklore says the light is the torch of a @entity143 or @entity104 who was beheaded and is searching for his head			2
still others maintain it 's the spirit of a decapitated miner or @entity156 soldier in search of his lost head			0
and for every story behind the lights , there 's another name for them			2
it has been referred to as the @entity134 , @entity6 's @entity24 , @entity133 , and @entity132			1
regardless of the tale behind it or its proper name , the locals who 've seen the phenomenon are adamant it is real			2
@entity232 from @entity233 , @entity4 has seen the light and told her story to @entity236			1
cabin in the woods : everyone in @entity107 has a tale about the light , which some insist is a brilliant red , while others say its a bright blue tattooed : a local shows off his devil tattoos			1
artists @entity20 and @entity18 portray a haunting landscape and the indelible mark it leaves on its inhabitants ‘ it was before midnight , ’ she said			0
‘ it was like a big , huge ball with a yellow glow and it went right straight through our car			0
’ @entity190 , a local historian , told @entity258 she 's seen the light , too			0
' its very spooky , ' she said			0
' it looks like a light way far off , and then its right on you			0
' @entity190 said she saw the light as a kid when she and her parents were lured to @entity30 out of curiosity			0
' my heart was just pounding and it was up in my throat and i thought my head was going to explode and my hands got all cold , ' she said			0
and like almost everyone else whose seen the bobbing orb , she has her own variation of the tale that 's behind it			0
according to @entity190 , a old @entity104 man came across some dead bodies in the woods where the @entity281 now appears			0
after he buried them , a white farmer came by carrying a lantern			0
the two killed one another but the light of the lantern still hangs there as an apparition			0
the @entity6 ’s @entity5 is as dedicated to the the inhabitants of the rural , impoverished area as it is to the @entity24			1
the series paints a vivid picture of both the haunting landscape and the fascinating people who populate it			0
' we feel the frequent and mysterious appearance of the @entity24 has come to represent for the people we meet a desire for redemption and the fear of slipping into darkness , ' write @entity18 and @entity20			1
' our aim is not to provide documentation , but to suggest a narrative that , in the spirit of the light , is part fixed in this unique region and part afloat in a mysterious , otherworldly realm			0
' ' we feel the frequent and mysterious appearance of the @entity24 has come to represent for the people we meet a desire for redemption and the fear of slipping into darkness , ' write @entity18 and @entity20 artist @entity316 is based in @entity317 , @entity34 where she teaches photography			1
@entity20 is a @entity319 - based artist and writer who primarily focuses on the @entity322 social landscape .			0
