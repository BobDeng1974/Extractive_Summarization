a 13 - year - old boy , whose mystery illness bound him to a wheelchair with a feeding tube , has made a miraculous recovery after years of suffering thanks to his determined mother who scoured the internet for answers as to why he was in excruciating pain			1
according to the today show , @entity13 , from @entity14 , @entity15 , was originally diagnosed with dysautonomia , a malfunction in the autonomic nervous system , and @entity19 , a tissue disorder - but the conditions did n't account for all of his ailments , which included stomach afflictions , loss of vision and agonizing neck pain			1
refusing to accept her son ’s initial diagnosis , @entity13 's mom , @entity30 , began researching his symptoms online , and came across the work of dr. @entity33 , a neurosurgeon at the @entity34 in @entity35 , who soon discovered her son had a @entity39 malformation , a treatable , yet rare condition that affects the cerebellum , the part of the brain that controls balance			1
three months later , @entity13 recalled the days after his surgery , saying he ' could n't believe ' his unbearable pain was gone after years of suffering			1
the teen 's health problems seemingly came out of nowhere when he was only nine years old , when the once - active child began to experience crippling stomach pain , prompting his parents to start limiting his food to the point that he was only consuming blueberries and chicken			1
but despite their best efforts , his ailments continued			0
@entity79 came headaches , tremors and an inability to control his body temperature or regulate his blood pressure			0
but even after @entity13 was diagnosed with dysautonomia and @entity19 , his physical suffering continued			2
difficult prognosis : @entity13 , who was active as a boy , found himself bound to a wheelchair after his condition worsened ' it was really horrendous pain and i could n't hold my head up for more than 10 minutes at a time , ' @entity13 explained			1
as his condition worsened , his worried mom began doing research on the internet and contacted other parents whose children had similar issues			1
chiari malformations are caused by structural defects in the brain and spinal cord			0
symptoms include dizziness , muscle weakness , numbness , vision problems , headaches and problems with balance and coordination			0
chiari malformations mostly occur during fetal development , although they may develop later in life after injury , infection or exposure to toxic substances it was once believed that @entity124 malformations occurred in only one in every 1,000 births , but research shows that they appear to be more common			0
babies who are born with @entity124 malformations do n't develop symptoms until adolescence or adulthood - if they develop them at all ' i started putting the pieces of the puzzles together , ' she said			0
her husband @entity136 noted that because their son 's issues started with severe abdominal pain , they found themselves focused on the wrong area of his body			2
' the whole time we were looking at stomach pain , never imagining that the problem could be in another part of his body , like the brain , ' he said			1
mrs @entity30 's determination to cure her son eventually brought her family to dr. @entity33			1
as soon as the neurosurgeon saw scans of the boy 's skull and spine , he immediately knew what was wrong			0
the scan revealed that @entity13 's skull and spine were not held together properly because the ligaments were too loose			2
the misalignment was causing his brain to be squeezed from the front and the back			0
' i knew that he could be helped by surgery , ' dr @entity33 said			2
' i knew that the chronic pain that he was in , that the inability to exercise could be helped , that we could change his life			0
' @entity13 is now walking again , and his chronic pain and headaches are gone as expected			2
but what is even more surprising is that the issues associated with his autonomic nervous system suddenly started to get better as well			0
' to me , it 's a miracle			0
it really is a miracle , ' mr @entity13 said			2
magical surgeon : dr @entity33 explained that @entity13 's skull and spine were n't hooked together properly , which caused his spine to push into his brain fast recovery : three months ago , @entity13 had surgery to properly align his skull and his spine , which improved all of his ailments and allowed him to start walking again			1

@entity13 , from @entity14 , @entity15 , started experiencing crippling stomach pain when he was only nine years old
as his *mysterious* condition worsened , he was put in a wheelchair , given a feeding tube and started experiencing vision loss in addition to his pain
his mom @entity55 ’s research led the family to dr. @entity33 , a neurosurgeon in @entity35 who diagnosed the teen with a rare brain condition
three months after surgery , @entity13 is making a full recovery
