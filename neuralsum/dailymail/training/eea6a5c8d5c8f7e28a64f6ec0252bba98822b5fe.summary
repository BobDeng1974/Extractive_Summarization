by @entity0 in @entity2 on tuesday , with just 12 minutes to go between @entity3 and @entity4 , @entity1 appeared to sink his teeth into the should of @entity6			1
at the time the referee failed to spot the incident , but @entity9 have now got involved , stating on their official website that they are set to investigate the 27 - year - old 's actions			1
@entity3 and @entity1 have until 5pm local time ( 9pm bst ) on wednesday to provide evidence , and @entity9 could ban the forward for up to two years			1
but what should his punishment be ? here , @entity21 experts off their opinions on how they think @entity1 should be disciplined ... shocking : he appeared to bite @entity25 's shoulder during @entity3 's win over @entity4 exhibit a : @entity28 pulls down his shirt to show teeth marks to the referee @entity32 @entity34 suspension from all football world - wide and to serve a minimum of six months			1
@entity37 only to be lifted after mandatory counselling and an independent psychological evaluation that he is mentally fit to return			2
@entity40 needs a 10 - match international ban as an absolute minimum but , more importantly , there must be a rehabilitative element to his punishment			1
tuesday night 's incident scarred the game , the @entity49 and @entity3 , but also @entity1 's club , @entity50 , and the @entity51 and can not be allowed to happen again			1
bans and fines clearly have little impact , so something else must be done to get through to this brilliantly talented but ultimately flawed @entity61 's hard to say how long his ban should be - but it should certainly be a suspension that applies to both international and club football			2
a suspension for solely international fixtures would n't be suffice			2
if his ban for biting @entity67 was 10 games - then his forthcoming punishment should certainly be double that			1
painful : @entity1 holds his teeth in pain while @entity6 rolls around the floor in agony following the incident the tooth hurts ! @entity1 appeared to bite @entity4 defender @entity6 at the @entity49 @entity76 is clear @entity1 should play no further part in this @entity49 or any football for a long @entity79 at another person on three separate occasions shows a mental problem that will only be recognised as such by @entity1 if the world governing body show their teeth			1
a year - long ban would n't be too much in my opinion , while a permanent gum shield on his return should be considered			2
i would also question those who have condoned his behaviour			2
manager @entity95 , captain @entity96 , and @entity97 ( who tried to cover up @entity6 's bite marks ) should face a grilling			1
until the turn of the year			2
not sure he 'll ever take responsibility for anything he does but i 'd throw the book at him			2
needs to be properly punished			0
@entity101 barlowwhat a shame it will be to see @entity1 removed from this thrilling tournament ; to take the edge from what promises to be a fabulous last 16 tie between @entity3 and @entity115			1
but @entity9 must deliver a heavy punishment , a ban of 10 international games say			1
it is akin to assault and he has previous but he has not badly injured anyone			0
i do n't see any reason to ban him from all football			0
that would not occur with any other type of on - field assault			0
controversy : @entity1 ( top left ) is captured biting @entity131 defender @entity67 in april 2013 previous : @entity1 received a seven game ban for biting @entity134 's @entity133 while playing for @entity135 , 2010 @entity136 's a difficult one , because the disciplinary precedents for this involve the same man			1
this strange , gifted man			0
by using what has been ruled before , it needs to be more than 10 games			0
but how many ? is it worse than kicking a fan ( @entity146 , nine months ) ? i do n't think it is			0
is it worse than @entity151 's rampage against @entity152 in 2012 ( 12 matches ) ? i 'd say so			0
and this is a repeat offender			0
he clearly needs more effective psychological help than he has so far received			0
but with it should come a significant action - a six - month ban from competitive football at any level			0
a @entity163 mask might also help			0
@entity165 incident should be judged on its merits			0
the hysteria that has surrounded it is natural but fifa should follow their own rules and ban him for three games - no more - for violent @entity173 will happen ? three or four match @entity9 ban			1
it 's a first offence - the other two occasions took place under different jurisdictions so are irrelevant			0
what should happen ? psychiatric counselling for what i would imagine is a serious condition which seems to manifest itself in stressful situations			0
and a worldwide 15 - match ban to impress on @entity1 the seriousness of the situation			1

@entity1 set to be disciplined by @entity9 for alleged bite on @entity6
he and @entity3 have until 5pm ( 9pm bst ) on wednesday to respond
