this weekend i ’ve been watching four midfielders from what might be considered ' unfashionable ' clubs , who are currently not involved in @entity6 ’s squad			1
three of them would not look out of place in @entity11 ’s diamond right now , the other is miles away from that level of football			2
anchoring that @entity11 midfield , i can see the @entity17 midfielder fitting in nicely			1
he ’s not the toughest tackler , and he ’s not the quickest , but his reading of the game suggests he could anticipate the play so well he would n’t need to rely on speed or last - gasp challenges			0
@entity14 ( left ) , @entity25 ( centre ) and @entity27 ( right ) deserve an @entity11 call - up @entity29 ( right ) of @entity30 is not good enough on the ball to be considered for an @entity11 call - up @entity11 manager @entity6 should look at some midfielders from ' unfashionable ' clubs for his squad one significant aspect of his game is his ability to ping a pass 40 or 50 yards to a lone striker to relieve any pressure			1
he can do that with accuracy and that is something @entity11 have n’t always had			2
i ’ve always had concerns about @entity14 ’s lack of mobility			2
his former team - mate @entity50 pointed out to me that neither @entity51 nor @entity52 are renowned for their running , and in @entity11 ’s qualification group we wo n’t need to do a huge amount of defending so why not have a look at what @entity14 can do ? we have been crying out for years for footballers with technical ability - @entity14 has it in abundance			1
he could challenge @entity63 for that place in the starting line - up in my opinion			1
what might count against him , though , is his last appearance for @entity11			2
@entity6 called him up for the friendly in @entity71 two years ago			0
along with @entity73 ’s @entity72 , @entity14 came on with the team 2 - 1 up and 16 minutes remaining ; @entity11 lost 4 - 2			1
that will have stuck in the manager ’s mind			0
@entity14 ( left ) could challenge @entity63 ( right ) for a place at the base of @entity11 's diamond @entity17 midfielder @entity14 ( right ) is technically brilliant and can direct long - distance paces perfectly @entity52 ( left ) and @entity51 ( right ) do not have much pace but have thrived on the international scene another name is @entity85 's @entity25			1
he was the @entity11 under 21 captain , leading them to the final of the @entity88 in 2009			0
he has n’t had a look in since then at international level and at the age of 27 time is running out			0
i do n’t see him at the base of a diamond for @entity11 , but i do see him as one of the two in the middle			1
he is industrious and has more recently started to add consistent quality to his distribution of the ball			1
@entity25 can also take a penalty - very few englishmen can confidently say that			0
indeed he once scored twice from the spot in an epic shoot - out against @entity105 for the @entity106			0
like @entity14 , i ’ve had my reservations about @entity25 for @entity11 , but i now think he ’s good enough			1
however i doubt he would be first choice when all of @entity6 ’s options are fit			0
@entity25 could easily play as one of the middle two for @entity11 in @entity6 's diamond formation the midfielder has captained @entity11 's @entity114 but is now 27 and has not had a full international cap @entity85 's @entity25 ( left ) is industrious and can take a penalty , which not many @entity118 players can i ’ve been an admirer of @entity119 ’s @entity27 for a long time and i definitely see him as an option at the base of a diamond for @entity11			1
his ability from set - pieces is one of his main strengths , but he has so much more			0
he can read the game , his defensive work off the ball is n’t always obvious on tv but is a stand - out feature when you watch him live , and he keeps things simple			0
he gets the ball , and gives it to a team - mate - keeping possession is his main objective , and once again that is something @entity11 have n’t always been good at			1
i ’m amazed a player so good on the ball has not had any international recognition at any level			0
he admits he bases his style on what @entity144 has been doing for @entity146 for many successful years			2
i just hope that @entity27 does n’t suffer the same fate at international level where @entity144 was shamefully ignored during his peak years			2
@entity119 's @entity27 is good on the ball and can play at the base of @entity11 's diamond formation @entity27 ( left ) has similar qualities to @entity146 's @entity144 ( right ) during his prime @entity14 , @entity25 and @entity154			1
but @entity29 ? no , not for me			0
i was at the @entity155 on saturday , @entity29 made a crucial error for @entity30 before @entity158 ’ second goal , but that was n’t the main reason i would have misgivings about him at @entity11 level			1
@entity29 went lunging into challenges , getting very tight to opponents , and being very physical with them			0
there was nothing subtle in his approach			0
this sometimes gets him into trouble in the @entity173 , as is well documented			0
his reputation goes before him but that reputation has been well and truly earned			0
@entity29 is not good enough on the ball for @entity11 and should not be given a call - up by @entity6 @entity30 's @entity29 ( left ) is extremely physical and this makes him a yellow card waiting to happen at international level , with referees more likely to buy the claims of players going to ground easily under a physical challenge , @entity29 is a yellow card waiting to happen			1
and when on a yellow , can he be trusted not to get another ? it ’s too big a risk for @entity6 to take in my view			2
on top of that @entity29 ’s quality on the ball is not exceptional , and certainly inferior to a lot of others challenging for the same position at the base of an @entity11 midfield diamond			1
@entity6 certainly took note when i labelled @entity200 the ' @entity201 ; in this column before his recent call - up			0
@entity14 , @entity25 and @entity27 will be hoping the @entity11 boss is reading this too			1
i ’m confident he will be			0
@entity200 was labelled the ' @entity201 ' in this column and @entity6 gave him an @entity11 call - up			2

four midfielders from ' unfashionable ' clubs , three deserve @entity11 chance
@entity17 's @entity14 could anchor @entity6 's diamond
@entity14 is technically brilliant and his lack of pace will not be caught out in qualification for the *euros* so he could challenge @entity63
@entity85 's @entity25 could play as one of two in middle of diamond
@entity25 is industrious and has *excellent* distribution of the ball
@entity119 's @entity27 definitely an option at base of diamond
@entity27 is similar to @entity144 at his best for @entity146
@entity30 's @entity29 quality on ball not good enough for @entity11
@entity29 is a yellow card waiting to happen *due* to his physicality
