shocking : @entity0 speaks from the balcony of the @entity3 embassy in @entity4 in 2012 and police say guarding the building has now cost £ 6m guarding the @entity3 embassy in @entity9 where @entity0 has claimed asylum has now cost taxpayers almost £ 6million , it was revealed today			1
@entity13 officers have been standing outside the @entity4 building since the @entity16 founder took refuge there in june 2012 - a vigil costing £ 11,000 per day			1
the 42 - year - old is wanted in @entity20 after allegedly sexually assaulting two women in @entity22 in 2010			2
for almost two years he lived in the embassy because he fears he will be extradited to @entity24 after he enraged the @entity25 by releasing thousands of its secrets in 2010			0
at all times there are three @entity31 officers waiting outside the embassy to arrest him			1
at least one stands on the steps and others will question visitors leaving in case it is @entity0 in disguise			0
all this has cost £ 5.9million so far , including £ 1million in overtime costs			1
baroness @entity41 , deputy chair of the @entity13 and @entity42 at the @entity43 , condemned the huge cost as ' ludicrous			2
' she said : ' it is absolute madness			0
i have been asking the @entity13 questions about this because clearly at the moment the cost is falling on the @entity9 taxpayers as a net police cost			1
' i have been asking if the government is going to pay			0
the @entity13 is apparently trying to claim back some of the money , but of course it is still the taxpayer who is paying for it			2
' it is complete madness when we are struggling to keep police officers on the beat			2
' costly exercise : police must stand guard outside the building in case the hacker leaves , but almost two years since he entered @entity0 has shown no sign of leaving she said that perhaps the @entity13 should just ' walk away ' from the situation			1
she said : ' i do understand the legal ramifications of the case , but the fact is this is a complete nonsense			0
' he could stay there for years			0
it is a terrible thought , i guess			0
' what he did with @entity16 was extremely valuable but at the same time evading justice just is not right and either somebody else has to pay - that is , the @entity20 authorities - or we just have to back off and stop guarding the embassy			1
' the hacker has endured a self - imposed imprisonment in a single room after being given diplomatic asylum at the @entity3 embassy in @entity9 ’s @entity4			1
@entity0 is still unapologetic about his role in helping to disclose government secrets			0
the embassy — strewn with red , yellow and blue @entity3 flags — takes up a single floor of an imposing block behind @entity100			0
initially , @entity0 slept on an inflatable mattress donated by embassy staff , who are described as having become ‘ like family ’ to him			0
but when it became clear his stay was not going to be temporary , a small room was transformed into his living quarters and a bed installed			1
life inside : since june 2012 , when he took refuge in the embassy to avoid extradition to @entity20 on sex charges , @entity0 has been living a stiflingly claustrophobic existence in a 15ft by 13ft room he is thought to have stood in direct sunlight for only about 20 minutes during his incarceration , when he emerged on the balcony to address his supporters in august 2012			1
he has a specially adapted lamp to mimic sunlight in his room — which measures just 15ft by 13ft			0
near a @entity124 fireplace he has a treadmill donated by the left - wing film - maker @entity127 and in his first year at the embassy he notched up 744 miles on the running machine			2
revealing the £ 5.9million cost in a @entity132 request , @entity31 said the costs included £ 1million in overtime costs .			2

guarding @entity9 building has cost £ 5.9m , including £ 1m overtime bill
@entity13 has stationed officers outside embassy since he entered in june 2012
police would arrest him if he left and then have him sent to @entity20 for trial
he lives in small room in the embassy containing a bed and a treadmill
