by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 is confident @entity3 can be a regular match - winner for the @entity5 after watching him do just that in @entity7			1
the 28 - year - old @entity9 winger chose @entity12 's tricky @entity11 opener in @entity13 as the perfect moment to display his undoubted talent on a sustained basis and fire his country to a precious victory			1
@entity3 's double , the second of which arrived inside the final minute of normal time at the @entity24 @entity23 , clinched a 2 - 1 win and fulfilled team - mate @entity2 's pre-match prediction			1
match winner : @entity3 scored @entity12 's winning goal in the 90th minute against @entity7 what a strike ! @entity3 's late strike ensured @entity12 won their opening @entity31 qualifier the full - back said : ' he [ @entity3 ] was brilliant , fantastic			1
i said to him before the game , " you can win us this match " because he 's got that ability to beat players and his confidence is up at the minute , and i 'm delighted to see it			2
' to be fair , i thought a lot of people would have snatched at it - @entity46 [ @entity47 ] actually played him in rather than shoot , which was great composure in his behalf			2
it was a good @entity9 goal			1
' we were delighted - he won us the game			2
moments of magic win games and @entity56 definitely did that tonight			0
' we all know that 's what he is capable of week - in , week - out and as long as he believes it , he can be a top , top player			2
' @entity3 's brace took his tally for @entity12 to five goals either side of @entity68 's 38th - minute equaliser , although the fact that it arrived in his 70th senior appearance is a stick that has often been used to beat him in the past			1
however , he is thriving on @entity73 after forcing his way into the team following his january arrival from @entity77 , and @entity2 and his team - mates at both domestic and international level will hope there is more to come			1
confidence boost : @entity2 believes @entity3 has benefited from a move to @entity9 the former @entity84 defender said : ' it 's difficult because he was playing in @entity86 and maybe not a lot of people follow the @entity86 league			1
he might have been doing brilliantly out there and you just do n't notice it			0
' but since he has come to us , the manager believes in him a lot			2
he has started the season very well and he showed tonight that he 's on top form			0
' it 's brilliant for him			0
his confidence is up - the move to @entity9 could have done him the world of good			1
we saw the best of @entity3 on sunday night			1
' left back @entity103 , who lined up behind @entity3 for much of the game , was equally thrilled by his contribution , but far from surprised			1
@entity103 said : ' we see him every day and we know how good a player he is			0
he has done fantastically well for our country and tonight showed just how big a player he is because he was outstanding			0
he scored two and came bitterly close to getting a third as well			2
' to score that late is important and gives us a good start , but throughout the game , i thought we fully deserved it			0
high praise : @entity12 manager @entity116 lavished praise on @entity9 star @entity3 ' when they got their goal , it was a bit of a setback , but i did n't think we panicked at all			1
we kept playing our football , we kept the ball really well and thankfully @entity56 came up with a piece of absolute brilliance and won us the game			0
' something like that , we see every day in training and when you have got a player like that in your team , you have got every chance all the time			0
' the @entity5 will now welcome minnows @entity133 to the @entity135 next month knowing victory there would send them into their toughest game of the campaign in @entity140 with maximum points and brimming with confidence			0
' we wo n't look too far ahead of the next game - the manager and the staff here wo n't let us , ' added @entity103			0
but if we can continue and get another positive result , we will go to @entity140 full of confidence			0
' that 's the minimum to go there with now , and hopefully we can do that			0
