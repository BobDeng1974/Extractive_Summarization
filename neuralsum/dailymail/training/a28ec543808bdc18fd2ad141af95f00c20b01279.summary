by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 11:00 est , 11 june 2013 updated : 13:46 est , 11 june 2013 @entity5 - born aviation pioneer @entity4 is finally getting recognition after @entity8 legislators have passed a bill insisting he flew two years before the @entity10 @entity8 legislators have passed a bill insisting that a @entity8 aviator flew two years before the @entity10 at @entity13 , @entity14 the measure is the latest twist in an effort to credit the first successful airplane flight to @entity5 - born aviator and @entity21 resident @entity4			1
he was born in @entity23 , @entity24 as @entity25			1
as a boy , he showed an interest in flight , experimenting with kites and earning the nickname ' the flyer '			2
his parents died in 1886 and 1887 , when he was still a boy			0
he then trained as a mechanic and traveled to @entity34 , where in 1888 he was forced to join the crew of a sailing ship			0
after several years at sea he arrived in the @entity38 in 1893 and anglicized his name to @entity4			1
the bill honors what it calls the first powered flight by @entity4 in 1901 , ‘ rather than the @entity10			1
’ @entity4 is credited by some for the first flight in august 1901			1
the @entity10 lifted off from @entity14 in december 1903			2
‘ we want to correct something that should have been corrected long ago , ’ said state rep. @entity46 , @entity47 , who spearheaded the legislation			0
‘ all we 're trying to do is correct history			0
there 's nothing in it for us			0
’ @entity54 , senior curator for aeronautics at the @entity56 , which displays @entity58 and @entity10 's plane at the @entity59 , said @entity4 's backers are ‘ absolutely wrong			1
’ @entity61 : this undated picture shows @entity4 with daughter @entity63 in front of his ' no. 21 ' , which reportedly sailed more than a mile two years before the @entity10 took off ‘ @entity4 's legend has spawned much speculation and hearsay , ’ he said			1
‘ people who have looked at this over the years ... almost unanimously reject the claim			0
’ gov. @entity73 has not committed to signing the legislation , but will review it when it reaches his desk , a spokesman said			0
@entity4 's wife @entity78 was n’t a big fan of his obsession with flying			1
in 1940 she gave an interview to the @entity82 in which she said her husband 's first words upon returning home from @entity86 on 14 august 1901 , were an excited , ' @entity88 , we went up ! ' mrs. @entity89 said her husband was always busy with motors and flying machines when he was not working in coal yards or factories			1
the interview quoted her as saying , ' i hated to see him put so much time and money into that work			0
' history rewritten : @entity58 and @entity10 face being written out of history now that the @entity4 story has been given credability @entity4 designed an aircraft in the early 1900s that could be driven like a car , but was fitted with wings that could be unfolded , turning the car into a plane			1
he envisaged owners being able to drive the car to a field , or suitable runway and then unfold wings on the side of the vehicle that would then turn the car into a plane			0
@entity4 then built his condor aircraft , also known as @entity120 , based on this flying car model			1
the aircraft had two engines ; a 20 horsepower engine used to fly the vehicle , and a 10 horsepower engine used for driving			0
the idea was that the pilot could switch between engines depending on whether they wanted to drive or fly the vehicle			0
@entity132 was also fitted with two propellers that were controlled and powered when the plane engine was selected			2
reports in the @entity136 in august 1901 claim @entity4 drove the @entity132 to a field outside @entity8 , unfolded the wings and made two demonstration flights			1
during the second flight , @entity4 is said to have flown for a mile and a half and reached a height of 50 feet			1
further reports claim he updated the model , called @entity145 , and made another demonstration flight on 22 january 1902 in front of 17 witnesses			0
mrs. @entity89 said her husband 's aviation efforts took their toll on the family budget and she had to work to help meet expenses			2
she said she never saw any of her husband 's reported flights			0
@entity8 has a long and storied history in aviation			1
aircraft engines were made at @entity159 in @entity160 beginning in 1925 , and a desk used by @entity162 is still on display at the jet engine manufacturer			0
and famed helicopter maker @entity165 set up shop in @entity47 in 1929 to make seaplanes			0
a recent burst of interest in @entity4 followed a documentary by an @entity173 historian , @entity172			2
in addition , @entity174 in the @entity38 and @entity5 have stoked interest			0
@entity177 , an influential industry publication , recently cited contemporary news accounts in concluding that @entity4 beat the brothers from @entity181 , @entity182 , into the air			1
@entity184 , a high school science teacher in @entity185 , said he has been working 30 years to promote @entity4 's achievement			1
he lobbied the legislature and even persuaded @entity189 's @entity188 in @entity86 to name an omelet the no. 21 , for the plane @entity4 flew			1
a report in the @entity136 on 18 august 1901 details eyewitness accounts of @entity4 's flight , which took place in @entity8 four days earlier			1
the journalist confirms that the flight took off from @entity86 , flew for about a mile and a half , made two turns and then landed safely he said the aviator is well - known in @entity8 for flying before the @entity10 and the world now needs to know it			1
‘ how can you prove someone did n't fly ? that 's what the @entity56 is trying to do , ’ @entity184 said			2
he and @entity46 said the @entity56 is forbidden by a contract with the executors of the @entity10 ' estate to admit that anyone else was the first to fly			2
@entity54 said the @entity56 signed a contract with two heirs of the @entity10 ' estate in 1948 , after the brothers ' deaths			2
the heirs insisted on the provision , he said , because they fought a fraudulent claim of early flights for 20 years			0
it does n't change what he said is the fact that @entity58 and @entity10 operated the first heavier - than - air machine			1
‘ what they achieved changed the face of the world , ’ he said			2
‘ they were the ones who took those final steps			0
they deserve the credit for it			0
’ @entity184 will not be persuaded to reject @entity4			2
‘ i do everything i can to keep the story alive , ’ he said .			0

@entity24 - born @entity4 is belatedly winning recognition as the original aviation pioneer
the @entity8 senate has passed a bill recognizing his achievement , months after an influential industry publication *acclaimed* him
@entity4 is *believed* to have flown his @entity132 plane in august 1901
the @entity10 - who first achieved flight two years later - now face being written out of the history books
@entity4 's wife was a big fan of his obsession with flying and did n't attend his *monumental* *breakthrough*
