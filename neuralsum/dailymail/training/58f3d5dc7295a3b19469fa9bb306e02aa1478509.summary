so spare a thought for @entity7 , 25 , who has had to cope with the upheaval all without being able to use her arms or legs			2
despite the challenges she faces , @entity12 , who suffers from a rare condition called arthrogryposis , is determined to prove the critics who thought she would n't be able to cope wrong			1
everybody assumed i would n't be able to manage , ' reveals @entity7			1
' you learn to cope in different ways			0
' ' from being a baby , everything went in my mouth , ' she adds			0
' it might be hard , you might have to try loads of different ways round it but there is a way of doing absolutely everything			0
' for @entity7 , who lives in @entity40 with husband @entity21 , 33 and children @entity19 , four , and @entity17 , two , this means doing everything from preparing breakfast to changing a nappy using her teeth			2
the amount of times i 've tasted poo , ' she grimaces			0
it 's so much easier to do a newborn 's nappy because they ca n't move - they ca n't run off from you ! ' retail therapy : @entity7 takes @entity17 and @entity19 for a trip to the shops using her mobility scooter impressive : @entity7 can even change a nappy using her teeth , and confesses she has tasted poo more than once also defying the doubters is 26 - year - old single mum , @entity65 , who has pseudoachondroplasia - the rarest form of dwarfism			1
just 3ft 6in tall , @entity65 's two - year - old son @entity69 is almost as big and strong as she is , which means she 's forced to hold on to him using reins when they go out			1
despite the difficulties , @entity65 is just as determined as @entity7 to make motherhood work in spite of her disabilities			1
' you find ways round everything , ' adds @entity7 , who has just had a third child			2
' it 's problem solving			0
i find it [ motherhood ] harder but it 's rewarding			0
it 's more rewarding than it is challenging			0
' i can do more for the children than i can do for myself			0
' see more in a special kind of @entity90 , tonight at 9pm on @entity91 difficult : @entity65 's two - year - old son @entity69 is almost as tall as she is , making him hard to control work : because @entity65 has a rare form of dwarfism , little @entity69 is nearly as strong as she is coping : @entity7 has had to find ways to do absolutely everything using her teeth , including brushing the children 's breakfast : according to @entity7 , she finds it easier to do things for her children than for herself			1
