by @entity0 published : 20:57 est , 18 march 2013 updated : 20:58 est , 18 march 2013 low - cost airlines , estate agents and gyms are among businesses that face being taken to court over the fairness of hidden charges under proposals put forward by the bodies which recommend law reform			1
@entity13 courts should be empowered to scrutinise the fairness of costs tucked away in small print , the @entity10 and the @entity11 said			1
under current laws , courts have the power to assess the fairness of a contract but are unable to look at the price			0
hidden charges : law reforms could mean future challenges to unfair extra costs in contracts to support customers against nasty surprises the commissions recommend that courts should not interfere with prices which are ' transparent and prominent ' - but when charges are hidden in small print , they should be given the power to assess them for fairness			1
@entity36 , the law commissioner leading on the project for @entity39 and @entity40 , said : ' the current law is baffling - so much so that consumers and regulators are reluctant to challenge unfair charges			1
' both traders and consumers need clearer law			2
if a price is transparent and prominent , the courts should not interfere - but other charges need to be fair			0
' he added : ' our approach gives traders control over what charges are exempt from review - provided they put them upfront			0
' the @entity29 said that the rise of price - comparison websites has piled pressure on traders to advertise low headline prices , while earning profits through other charges			0
angry customers : budget airline @entity64 is well - known for hitting consumers with charges outside the headline price , such as last minute baggage penalities they said small print is not ' just about font size ' - it also includes poor layout , densely phrased paragraphs and legal jargon			1
@entity74 - based @entity64 is among companies well - known for hitting consumers with charges outside the headline price , such as for excess baggage , while mobile phone contracts and payday loans also face increased scrutiny under the proposals			2
the @entity29 said the current law was ' unacceptably uncertain ' , which risks damaging businesses as well as consumers			2
businesses face reputational damage and substantial legal costs if a charge is later found to be unfair , they said			0
transparency : companies offering payday loans , often at huge levels of interest , would also be scrutinised if the proposals were accepted other recommendations from the @entity29 include more powers to remove legal jargon from the contracts entered by consumers when they purchase computer software , designed to limit the product 's use			1
the so - called end user licence agreements ( @entity103 ) should be expressed in ' plain , intelligible language '			2
professor @entity105 , @entity106 , said : ' the software industry has argued that consumer legislation does not apply to some @entity109 as they are ' licences ' rather than ' contracts '			0
our recommendations close this supposed loophole			0

law reform may bring an end to nasty surprises in small print of contracts
@entity10 wants to *tackle* poor layout , densely phrasing and jargon
