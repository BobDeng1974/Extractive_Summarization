a @entity1 court today ordered @entity2 to hand over the identities of racist and anti-semitic users to the police			1
in a test case which will have widespread implications for the millions who tweet every day , the @entity6 ruled it unacceptable for people to post hateful material anonymously			1
this was despite lawyers for the hugely popular micro-blogging site refusing to assist detectives			0
offensive : a @entity1 court has ordered @entity2 to hand over the identities of racist and anti-semitic users after the hashtag @entity20 ( # agoodjew ) went viral in @entity1 last year @entity23 students brought the case , saying @entity2 had a moral duty to name and shame hateful posters			1
it follows a massive increase in the number of anti-semitic tweets appearing across @entity1			1
in october , the student bodies asked @entity2 to remove a number of messages which appeared under the hashtag @entity20 ( # agoodjew ) , with vicious examples including : ' # agoodjew is a dead jew			1
’ the hashtag became the third most popular in @entity1 , with thousands attacking the religion			1
@entity1 , which has a shameful history of @entity41 behind it , now has a number of strict laws aimed at combatting hate crimes			2
precedent : in a test case which will have widespread implications for the millions who tweet every day , the @entity6 ( above ) ruled it unacceptable for people to post hateful material anonymously the @entity52 of @entity1 ( @entity53 ) and three other similar groups now want @entity2 to hand over the names of all those responsible so they can be prosecuted			1
@entity56 , @entity2 ’s @entity1 barrister , had told the court that @entity2 ' data is collected and stored in the @entity59 ’ – namely in @entity60 , where the site is based			2
ms @entity62 said that @entity2 was accordingly ' subject to @entity59 law ’ , adding : ' should i submit myself to the law of a different country to where i work ? i do n’t know			0
’ suggesting that there was a ' huge void , a question mark ’ in the law , ms @entity62 suggested that only an @entity59 judge could decide whether a @entity59 company should hand over data to the @entity1 authorities			2
@entity76 , counsel for the @entity23 groups , in turn said @entity2 had a ' commerical interest ’ in protecting the anonymity of its users			0
' @entity2 is playing a commercial game by raising a number of legal hurdles to not having to comply with its legal obligations , ’ said mr @entity76			0
