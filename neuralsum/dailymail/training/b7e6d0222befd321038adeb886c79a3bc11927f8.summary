by @entity0 published : 16:42 est , 26 november 2012 updated : 17:02 est , 26 november 2012 a horrified dog walker discovered the bodies of 11 puppies who had been skinned and then dumped in a public park			1
the dead animals were found in a bag that had been tossed along the side of the road in a @entity11 suburb			1
the incident is the second time that skinned animals were found in the state			1
dna tests will be done to determine if the puppies are dogs , coyotes or some other domestic or wild animal , while necropsies will be conducted to learn how they died			2
outraged : animal rights advocates at the @entity24 are concerned after a bag of 11 skinned puppy corpses was found ditched near a park a woman walking found the bodies friday in woods near a park in @entity32 , outside @entity33 , the @entity24 said			1
the bodies were in or near a bag that had been torn open , perhaps by an animal			2
unless a witness comes forward , it 's usually difficult to make arrests in animal cruelty cases , authorities said , meaning that both the culprit and the motive will remain at large			2
victims : the dead pups were either coyotes ( like the ones pictured here ) or some breed of dog but it is difficult to tell post-mortum ' it could have been kids or some whacked - out person who found an abandoned litter of puppies or coyotes and just thought they 'd have some fun , ' said @entity60 , the county humane society 's shelter manager			1
' that 's what 's so scary about not being able to ( solve ) these cases , and find out what happened , because you do n't know who 's out there			0
because , unfortunately , animal abuse is a precursor to harming ( people )			0
' the discovery came the same week another animal was found skinned , with its feet cut off and rope tied to one leg , about 20 miles away in @entity77			1
that involved a larger animal , perhaps one sought for its pelt , according to humane society officer @entity82			0
two pairs of thin latex gloves were found beside that animal , and will be sent to a forensics lab. if it proves to be a coyote , the case may amount to little more than a citation for improper disposal , since it is legal to hunt coyotes in @entity11			1
but investigators think legitimate hunters would have disposed of the body properly			0
ms @entity82 believes the two cases might be related , given that the animals were skinned			1
the puppies appeared to be a few months old , weighing less than 10 pounds , according to ms @entity100 , who added that it 's hard to know their age without knowing the breed			0
an animal advocacy group has offered a reward for tips that lead to an arrest and conviction			0
' somebody purposely took time and precision and skinned animals , over and over			1
it 's really disgustingly gruesome			0
i ca n't imagine what 's going through somebody 's head when this happens , ' said @entity120 of the @entity121			0
scene : police are still searching for any clue over who killed the pups or why , as little was known when a woman found the dead bodies while walking her own dog in @entity32 neighbors and friends are often reluctant to report animal cruelty , fearing retribution , animal welfare officials said			1
this has proven true even in notorious cases in which animals are set on fire , the @entity135 said			2
' someone usually knows but is afraid to come forward			0
often there are multiple witnesses who maybe feel intimidated to not ` snitch , ' said spokeswoman @entity144			0
' these are disturbing cases - not only are helpless animals suffering cruel fates , but it 's unsettling to know that people capable of these kinds of depraved acts are members of our own communities			2
' coyotes are now more common in @entity11 than black bear or bobcats , according to state game officials			1
the @entity158 now allows them to be hunted and trapped to reduce their population			0
more than 43,000 coyotes were bagged in 2010 , according to commission data .			0
