the free web app ( above ) lets people search for information about people who own different phones , eat different foods , shop in various supermarkets and live in certain areas , among other data the app does not show the typical fan or customer , because as @entity10 explained : ‘ if it did , most groups would look very similar , and you would n't learn a lot about the specifics of particular thing			1
’ instead , it shows what is particularly true about a group			2
@entity10 compares the group to their natural ' comparison set '			2
for example , it compares fans of @entity50 to anyone who has rated any tv shows , and detemines which of the thousands of datapoints most ' overscore ' in the target group			2
if something is only true of 1 per cent of the overall population , but is true of 6 per cent of @entity10 ’s target group , it might score very highly , but this does n't mean it is true of all of them			1

another example that @entity10 gives is if many of the football teams show a female character , it does n’t mean that most of the fans are female , but simply that compared to other football teams , there are more female fans than you would expect			2
the @entity10 panel only includes adults of 18 years or older , and if the sample shows 52 people , @entity10 explained that it does n’t mean they only surveyed 52 people			2
instead , it means that , of the tens of thousands of people who took part , 52 have identified themselves as fans or customers of that particular brand of item			0
