by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent published : 19:41 est , 13 august 2013 updated : 03:26 est , 14 august 2013 reforms : justice minister @entity3 magsitrates are to be given the power to overrule police officers who give ‘ soft ’ spot - fines and cautions to violent thugs and thieves			1
the ‘ scrutiny ’ powers will allow victims to challenge officers who let criminals off with out - of - court penalties			2
it could result in offenders who were originally handed a caution or other penalty being called to court to receive a tougher sentence			1
justice minister @entity3 will announce the reforms today as part of a speech on criminal justice			1
he will say : ‘ there is definitely a place for out - of - court disposals in ensuring justice is brought in cases which may otherwise not have come to court and as a proportionate response to some low - level offending			1
‘ but we need to make sure that it is only these cases which are getting out - of - court disposals , and that all cases which should properly be brought before a court are brought to court			2
’ the use of cautions is currently the subject of a major review ordered by justice secretary @entity42 , which is expected to report within weeks			2
huge disparities between forces in how cautions are used have raised concerns about ‘ postcode justice ’			2
overall , the police handed out 205,700 cautions in the year to september 2012 , according to the latest @entity51 figures			0
more than ten per cent were for violent attacks , one in three were for theft and handling stolen goods , and a third were for drug offences			0
tens of thousands more are dealt with using only ‘ restorative justice ’ programmes , which critics say amount to little more than an apology			0
the new measure is likely to appeal to shopkeepers infuriated by failures to prosecute thieves who are let off with an £ 80 spot - fine			0
the new measure is likely to appeal to shopkeepers infuriated by failures to prosecute thieves who are let off with an £ 80 spot - fine it could also be used by those who confront drunken yobs only to see them avoid going to @entity76 plan is part of a wider move to redefine magistrates ’ responsibilities			0
mr @entity3 will warn that thousands of cases they could deal with end up in the crown court unnecessarily			1
some 4,000 offenders sent before a crown court were given a sentence of six months in prison or less – which magistrates could have dispensed			1
but mr @entity3 will say that the government needs ‘ to get the balance right at the lower end of the spectrum as well ’			1
he will float plans to take thousands of low - level driving offences out of the courtroom			0
instead of facing a full hearing before a panel of three magistrates , those who jump red lights , drive without valid documents or commit parking offences would be dealt with by a single magistrate ‘ sitting in an office ’			0
the new process would apply only in cases where the driver pleaded guilty – around nine in ten of the half - million such cases handled annually by the courts			0
mr @entity3 will say : ‘ the time magistrates spend in court should be focused on those cases where they make a real difference to their communities			1
‘ their core skills of deciding on bail , fact - finding and sentencing should be put to best effect			0
