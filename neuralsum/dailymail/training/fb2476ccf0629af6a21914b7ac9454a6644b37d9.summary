by @entity0 published : 11:29 est , 6 october 2013 updated : 11:31 est , 6 october 2013 @entity2 would be more vulnerable to a catastrophic terrorist attack if @entity4 succeeds with his bid to break up @entity6 , a new report from the @entity8 will claim this week			1
@entity6 ’s top defence officials have produced a damning 86 - page assessment of the impact that separation would have on @entity2 ’s security , which warns of the terrifying threat to the everyday lives of @entity2			2
the devastating dossier will show that the tiny defence budget proposed by the @entity18 could heighten the risk of a terror attack which could close down the water , gas or electricity supplies to every home and business in the country			1
@entity28 risk : @entity2 would be more vulnerable to a catastrophic terrorist attack if @entity4 succeeds with his bid to break up @entity6 , the report will claim			1
above , mr @entity4 addresses a rally of pro-independence campaigners in @entity33 last month it is expected to say that a separate @entity2 may also be unable to protect itself from a ‘ cyber attack ’ which could see criminals or rogue states raid the bank accounts of hard - working people across the country			2
and it will also warn that the country would face a defence jobs @entity43 , including the shutdown of @entity2 ’s shipyards and the mass withdrawal of private firms in the defence sector , leading to the loss of tens of thousands of vital jobs			1
the report will attempt to highlight the risks to a separate @entity2 by showing the huge efforts already carried out to protect @entity2 as part of the @entity6 , including defence against the threat from foreign nations and terrorists and from attacks on the country ’s everyday infrastructure , such as water and electricity supplies and phone and computer connections			1
debate : speaking exclusively to the @entity69 , defence secretary @entity68 claimed the @entity18 's plans are a ' dagger poised at the heart of @entity2 's industrial infrastructure ' speaking exclusively to the @entity74 ahead of publication of the report on tuesday , defence secretary @entity68 evoked the language of the battlefield by claiming that the @entity18 ’s plans are a ‘ dagger poised at the heart of @entity2 ’s industrial infrastructure ’			1
he revealed that @entity6 networks are under constant attack , with 400,000 attacks on the government ’s internal systems in the last year alone			0
he said : ‘ everything that i ’ve seen says to me that the @entity86 is n’t really interested in defence			0
what it has said on defence looks like it has been made up on the back of a fag packet			0
‘ those who are promoting the case for @entity2 independence owe the @entity2 people a proper explanation of how they would be kept safe as they go about their daily business , how their families would be kept safe and how their jobs would be protected , because the defence industry is going to be decimated by what the @entity86 is proposing			1
‘ the report will show the challenge of providing security for @entity2 people ; security in the sense of defence but also about securing the everyday infrastructure they use in their daily lives , making sure the water supply and utilities are safe from attack , that computer networks used in the workplace are not compromised and their details vulnerable			1
‘ it is about the impact on @entity2 industry and the @entity2 industrial base and the impact on jobs and employment - and the impact on prosperity and ordinary domestic security for people across @entity2			2
’ the report will warn that 9000 direct jobs would be at risk at the @entity133 and @entity134 naval bases by the end of the decade as a result of the @entity18 ’s intention to remove @entity138 from @entity2 if it secures a yes vote in next year ’s referendum			1
rally : thousands of pro-independence campaigners marched through @entity33 on september 21 pro-independence : the rally was the second of three large marches held in the run up to next year 's referendum it will also suggest that @entity2 ’s shipyards could lose all of their vital orders from the @entity8 , because it does not hand contracts to foreign countries , which could lead to the decimation of the vital shipbuilding industry			1
and it will say that independence could result in the mass withdrawal of private defence firms from @entity2 , as they will not want to be at risk of losing @entity8 work			1
that could prove to be disastrous for the 16,000 defence jobs based in @entity2			2
no major defence firms have publicly stated their concerns about separation , but they have raised their concerns privately			0
mr @entity68 said he has urged company bosses to speak up on the risks and expects some to do so in the next year			0
it is a real dagger poised at the heart of @entity2 's industrial infrastructure @entity68 ‘ we have been making the case to the defence industry that they need to speak up , ’ he said			1
‘ i hope that as we move through next year towards the referendum they will at least be frank with their own workforces about these issues			0
‘ it is thousands and thousands of jobs across @entity2 at risk			0
it is the shipbuilding industry , it is the hi - tech industrial base – people like @entity188 – it is the 9000 direct jobs in @entity133 and @entity134 by the end of the decade that are at risk because of the @entity86 ’s threat to @entity134			0
' then of course there are the thousands and thousands of jobs in the supply chain			0
‘ it is a real dagger poised at the heart of @entity2 ’s industrial infrastructure			1
’ last week , the @entity201 revealed that mr @entity68 is building a new offensive ‘ cyber strike force ’ costing up to £ 500 million to stave off the threat of attacks on @entity6 ’s systems			1
the spending is in addition to hundreds of millions of pounds spent every year on defensive systems			0
mr @entity68 said building the whole cyber defensive system from scratch in an independent @entity2 would need ‘ huge fixed cost investment ’			2
he said : ‘ there are significant economies of scale and it is clear that the @entity6 is able to deliver a level of cyber protection for all the people of the @entity6 as they go about their business and daily lives in a way that an independent @entity2 would find very difficult to do , especially within the budgets that have been set out already			0
cyber force : mr @entity68 poses in the top - secret bunker beneath the @entity8 , from where the cyber wars of the future will be fought to starve off the threat of attacks on @entity6 's systems ‘ we have to be able to defend that it infrastructure against attacks , whether from state actors , terrorists , criminal hackers , and that will become increasingly important in the future			1
the financial system is a regular target of cyber attackers			0
’ the new @entity8 report will be the fifth in a series of ‘ @entity248 ’ papers produced by the @entity6 government to assess the implications of independence			0
it is will cover all areas of defence in the @entity6 and highlight the economic and employment benefits of the industry to @entity2 , as well as the damage that independence could do			2
it will also show how @entity2 members of the armed forces can enjoy ‘ varied and interesting ’ careers in one of the world ’s most highly - regarded forces – and warn that they might not want to leave the @entity6 ’s forces for a smaller standalone @entity263			0
significantly , it will also highlight that existing units based in @entity2 are part of the @entity266 – meaning a separate @entity2 could not simply ‘ co-opt ’ them			0
the report will say : ‘ @entity269 might very well not wish to leave the @entity266 to join much smaller forces , not least because of strong bonds of loyalty			0
‘ from a defence perspective , the transition to independence would therefore be extremely complex , raising serious questions over how an operational capability for an independent @entity2 state could be managed			2

@entity281 would be more vulnerable to terrorist attacks , a new report will claim this week
attacks could shut down water , gas and electricity supplies across country
next year , four million @entity2 will vote in independence referendum
@entity18 's plans are a ' dagger poised at the heart of @entity2 's industrial infrastructure ' , says defence secretary @entity68
