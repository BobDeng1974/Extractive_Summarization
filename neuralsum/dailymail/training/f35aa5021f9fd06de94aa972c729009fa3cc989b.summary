by @entity0 @entity3 approved ignition switches for cars that have been linked to 13 deaths , even though the parts did not appear to meet the company 's specifications , officials of @entity2 told @entity11 congressional investigators			1
in a memo released on sunday by the @entity15 , documents provided by @entity3 and a federal regulator provided ' unsettling ' information , according to @entity18 representative @entity17 , who leads a subcommittee of the panel			0
the memo was released ahead of tuesday 's testimony from @entity3 chief executive @entity23 , who will appear at the committee 's first public hearing on the recalls			2
she is likely to be asked why it took @entity3 so long to identify and address the ignition switch problem			2
during a crash test by the @entity11 government - ignition switches in the car were approved despite being faulty , part supplier @entity2 says the information from @entity2 officials was detailed in the memo , which is mainly a chronology of actions taken by @entity3 and the @entity41 since the late 1990s and through friday , when @entity3 expanded its global recall of cars with defective ignition switches to 2.6 million			1
@entity3 switches in @entity46 and other models were prone to being bumped or jostled into accessory mode while cars were moving , which would shut off engines and disable power steering , power brakes and airbags , leading to dozens of crashes			2
@entity2 told @entity11 congressional investigators last week that @entity3 approved the original part in 2002 , despite the fact it did not meet @entity3 specifications congressional investigators also want to know what led @entity41 , as long ago as 2007 and 2010 , to determine that there was not a safety defect trend with airbags that were failing to deploy in @entity46			1
' what did @entity41 do to investigate whether a trend existed ? what data did it consider , ' the committee asked			0
the @entity67 said @entity3 had submitted more than 200,000 documents on the ignition switches			1
the panel said the @entity41 submitted about 6,000 documents			0
mixup : consulting materials engineer @entity73 shows the serial numbers are the same for the 2006 ignition switch and a newer one			0
@entity78 helped to conduct the engineering investigations and failure analysis that resulted in the recall of 1.65 million @entity3 vehicles @entity17 , a @entity83 @entity18 , did not give details on what was ' unsettling ' about the information the panel received			0
his statement was accompanied by the memo , prepared by @entity18 investigators			0
' fragile ' switch according to one entry of the chronology in the memo , officials of @entity2 , which supplied the ignition switches to the recalled @entity3 cars , told committee investigators that @entity3 had approved the part , even though sample testing of the ignition switch torque was below the original specifications set by the automaker			1
the committee , according to aides , does not know @entity3 's thinking on why it may have approved a part that did not meet all specifications			1
one aide , who asked not to be identified , noted that there were 60 specifications for the switch and it is not clear what the significance is of one specification being below - standard			0
that is one of the questions the committee intends to ask in hearings			0
@entity3 knew as early as 2001 that it was facing problems with its ignition switch , but no auto recalls were ordered until earlier this year			1
a february 2005 entry in the congressional committee 's chronology illustrates that engineers were grappling with what to do about the defective ignition switches			1
' engineers considered increasing or changing the ignition switch ' torque effort , ' but were advised by the ignition switch engineer that it is ' close to impossible to modify the present ignition switch ' as the switch is ' very fragile and doing any further changes will lead to mechanical and / or electrical problems			0
' the committee 's memo concludes with a series of questions , which likely will dominate tuesday 's hearing with @entity23			0
' why did @entity3 approve ignition switches that did not meet its specifications for torque performance ? what was @entity3 's assessment of the implications for performance and safety , ' the memo asked			1
it is also not clear yet which @entity3 engineer approved a revision to the ignition switch in 2006 , and why the change did not lead to an earlier recall of older model cars to fix the problem .			2

parts manufacturer @entity2 says it raised *concerns* about the ignition switches but @entity3 approved them
more than z dozen deaths linked to the part have *sparked* global recalls numbering in the millions
