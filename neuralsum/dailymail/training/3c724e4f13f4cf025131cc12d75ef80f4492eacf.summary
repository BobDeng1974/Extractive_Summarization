by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 11:34 est , 8 august 2012 updated : 03:05 est , 10 august 2012 a candidate has criticised ‘ ridiculous ’ rules that bar him from standing for election as a police commissioner because he was fined £ 5 for two minor offences 46 years ago when he was just 13			1
@entity7 , a father - of - four , who has @entity9 security clearance , stepped down from his £ 90,000 - a - year job as director of strategy for the @entity13 partly to run for the role			1
but he has had to step down as @entity16 candidate from the contest to become @entity18 ( @entity18 ) for @entity19 and @entity20 after the @entity21 and @entity22 ruled that the way the law was drafted means there is no room for manoeuvre , even though his conviction would be considered ‘ spent ’ under the @entity29			1
unable to escape his past : @entity7 holds a photo of himself aged 13 in the running : @entity33 is also a candidate however , there is no bar on police being recruited or keeping their jobs if they have a minor conviction			1
meanwhile , a string of mps who were heavily criticised during the expenses scandal continue to be free to stand in the november elections across the country			1
@entity33 , who earned the nickname two jabs when he thumped a protester during the 2001 election campaign but was never charged , is also a candidate			1
@entity48 will have the power to set priorities for chief constables and decide their local force ’s budget			1
the rules had already led the @entity56 veteran @entity55 to pull out because he feared that his £ 30 fine at the age of 14 for being a passenger in a stolen car would have disqualified him			1
home secretary @entity61 then said the rules were not meant to cover such historic convictions			2
inspiring career : mr @entity64 , pictured with sons @entity66 ( on the right ) , @entity0 and grandson @entity68 , wanted to make a contribution and stop ageing politicians taking commissioner roles but mr @entity7 has now been told that , because he was convicted in 1966 of trespass on the railway and possession of an offensive weapon , he would also be forced to withdraw			1
@entity16 is now canvassing its other candidates to check that none have an undisclosed juvenile conviction			1
last night , mr @entity7 , of @entity79 , @entity20 , said the legislation was ‘ absolutely ridiculous ’ , adding : ‘ this was a flawed policy idea from the beginning and it ’s now proving to be absolutely and fatally flawed			1
’ he said he had received hundreds of emails of support , and would be seeking legal advice on whether there were grounds for him to challenge the legislation			2
in a second development , it emerged magistrates will also be banned from standing			2
the @entity21 had intended to ban only judges but @entity95 , the senior presiding judge in @entity96 and @entity97 , has issued guidance that , in order to protect judicial independence , magistrates would have to quit the bench just to take part in the contest			2
this is despite the fact that the police authorities which are being replaced by elected commissioners have long had magistrates among their membership			2
the @entity110 suffered horrific burns to 46 per cent of his body during the @entity56 conflict in 1982			2
as a teenager he was arrested when he was in a stolen car with two or three other males aged between 18 and 27			2
mr @entity64 always said he was not aware the care was stolen , but on advice , pleased guilty at the subsequent trial			2
he was fined £ 30 and put on probation for three months			0
' these are the details of the offence			0
at the time i was 13 years of age in 1966 and living on a council estate in @entity127			1
' i had no previous involvement with the police and came from a good and caring family			0
' i remember very well the knock on the door from a group of lads i knew from school			0
' they persuaded me to go out with them and i felt i had little choice			1
' i also knew from what they said that if i refused they could make my life difficult at school			0
we went to the railway embankment and i felt very uncomfortable about this			1
' one of the lads pulled out an air gun and started shooting at cans			0
i never touched the air gun and felt unable to leave , as i was frightened at what might happen at school			1
' a goods train passed and presumably the guard reported our presence to the police who arrived a short time later			1
the lads with the air gun ran away whilst i and two others froze and were arrested			0
' my next memory is of the police coming to my house and talking to my parents in a separate room			0
' the police never questioned me to my knowledge			0
i then went to court and was to the best of my knowledge charged with trespass on the railway and possession of an offensive weapon			0
' i was told to plead guilty to the two charges even though i had never touched the air gun			0
' i was fined £ 2 and 10 shillings on both counts			0
both of these offences are to the best of my knowledge “ imprisonable ” offences			0
' i carried on at school , attended @entity186 and put the offence behind me			0
i have never been convicted of any other offence			0
' it was only when i qualified as a social worker and started applying for jobs that i realised i would have to disclose this previous offence			0

@entity7 was just 13 when the *incident* happened over *40* years ago
he was living on a council estate at the time and felt too ' frightened ' to leave
' i intend to fight this ruling to the *highest* level , ' says the @entity16 candidate
