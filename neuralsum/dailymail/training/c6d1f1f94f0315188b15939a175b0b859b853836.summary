guilty : @entity7 , shown as her verdict was handed down on tuesday , has been found guilty on tuesday of murder in the explosive death of her ex-husband @entity18 haunting past : @entity12 smirks as the verdict settles in on tuesday in a @entity29 , @entity31 court but prosecutors described @entity12 as a gold digger who hired a former boyfriend to kill @entity18 to collect on a $ 2million life insurance policy in order to maintain her extravagant taste for the good life			1
it 's been nearly two decades since @entity18 died when his car exploded as he was leaving a @entity3 - area country club after playing golf			2
authorities said @entity12 paid ex-boyfriend @entity46 $ 400,000 to carry out the hit			1

' the state went after the easy marks , ' defense attorney @entity54 told jurors during closing arguments , indicating that @entity18 had plenty of other enemies with better motives to kill him			0
' you have to tell the state : " you made a mistake			0
" ' prosecutors presented a portrait of a woman who grew accustomed to the high life and found herself struggling financially with an easy $ 2million way out			1
the state 's case against her hinged largely on the purported secret arrangement between @entity12 and @entity46 , who the defendant dated while working as a real estate broker in @entity76 , @entity77 , after she divorced @entity18			1
while @entity12 claimed she had paid @entity46 the $ 400,000 for assistance with business ventures and financial planning , prosecutors argued the money was clearly payment for the hit			1
scene : the prosecution contends that while @entity12 was not at the @entity3 - area country club when her ex husband @entity18 was killed in 1996 , she paid @entity46 to plant the bomb plot : @entity12 had entered a plea of not guilty but jurors were convinced by voicemails she left for her ex-boyfriend - turned - hitman who was convicted in 2010 ( seen in court last week ) ' he 's not getting paid for business advice that she never takes â € ” he 's getting paid for murder , ' prosecutor @entity100 said in closing arguments			1
during the trial , in addition to witnesses , prosecutors used financial records and telephone conversations that @entity46 secretly recorded during talks with @entity12			2

' defense lawyers said the calls were merely the ramblings of a con man			0
one prosecution witness , a longtime friend of @entity12 , testified that @entity12 once told her how easy it would be to hire someone to kill her husband			0
back in the day : the prosecution painted @entity12 , seen left in an undated photo , as a gold digger who left her real estate developer husband @entity18 ( right ) after he lost much of his fortune the defense downplayed the testimony , noting @entity12 was distraught at the time after having a fight with @entity18 during which he threatened her			2
@entity12 ' lawyers also called into question the witness ' memory			0
@entity18 was a developer who made millions investing in @entity141 bingo halls and slot - machine parlors in @entity31 and @entity143 before @entity144 authorized tribes to open full - blown casinos			0
but after the real estate market declined and he lost control of his gambling interests , @entity18 went broke			0
upset : on thursday , the @entity31 court heard recordings that @entity12 ' ex boyfriend @entity152 ( pictured ) made when he was calling her about payments for the bombing that 's around the time @entity12 filed for divorce , prosecutors said			1
the couple , who had two children together , separated , but @entity12 remained the beneficiary of @entity18 's insurance policy , paying the premiums herself			1
she eventually moved to @entity76 and worked in real estate before meeting @entity46 , and prosecutors said the two would later hatch a plan to kill @entity18 and collect on the policy			1
after the killing , @entity46 was on the run from a warrant for his arrest in @entity77 on fraud charges while @entity12 was sending him money for the hit , eventually adding up to $ 400,000 , prosecutors told jurors			1
the investigation into @entity18 's killing stalled until @entity46 's arrest in 2005 in @entity181 on the fraud charges			0
that 's when both @entity12 and @entity46 became the key suspects in the killing			0
authorities say he kept detailed records of his financial transactions with @entity12 , including recorded telephone conversations and invoices			0

her case was delayed after a judge ruled she was mentally unfit to stand trial at the time			0
@entity12 ' attorneys argued throughout the trial that the evidence against her was flimsy , and that @entity12 was already wealthy with her own money			0
