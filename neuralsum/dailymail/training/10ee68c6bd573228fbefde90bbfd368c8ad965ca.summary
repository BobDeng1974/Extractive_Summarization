not many people would turn to a sat nav , a photograph or a pendulum to find a lost pet			1
but that 's exactly what one cat lover did , using powers of the supernatural to find missing moggies and reunite them with their owners			1
' dowsing ' is the dangling of a pendulum and using the direction in which it moves to find a lost object			1
@entity18 from @entity19 uses the anciant method of @entity12 to find missing cats although some may think this slightly strange , @entity18 , 48 , says that the ancient art of dowsing should n't be knocked after he found four cats using his pendulum which he bought on @entity28 and is made out of crystal			1
the father of two from @entity32 , @entity33 , is regularly contacted by panic - stricken owners asking to help find their missing pet and explained that the process of finding the stray tabbies has been proven to work			1
mr @entity18 believes his work can help owners be reunited with their lost cats ( file photo ) he said : ' people contact me through @entity45 , and send me a picture of their lost cat , its name and the area where it went missing			1
i keep a picture of the cat on the laptop next to me with a sat nav map on my phone			2
' first i have to clear my head of absolutely everything so my mind is completely empty			0
' then i hold the pendulum above the map on my phone and ask questions , such as : ' is the cat alive ? is it injured ? is it being kept in a house ? ' the pendulum will move clockwise for yes and anti-clockwise for no. ' when i ask it to show me where the cat is , the pendulum will then sway to a certain area on the map			2
' i keep zooming in on the area until i can zoom in no more and i get to a street name			0
in total it usually takes about half an hour for me to find where the cat might be , and i contact the owner to let them know			2
' where i 've been successful i usually get within 50 metres of where the cat was found , which is good considering i only started to do this seriously a few months ago			1
' @entity18 , who delivers catalogues for a living , also used his psychic powers to find his own pet cat @entity89 nearly four years ago when she went missing			1
he said : ' this was the first time i decided to use a sat nav map instead of a map in a book , and the pendulum guided me to an area not too far away from where i live			0
' i put up leaflets straightaway and on that same day , someone got in touch to say she was sleeping in their shed - in the same place that the pendulum guided me to			0
' but this was n't the last time the method of dowsing would come to the rescue when another of @entity18 's cats went missing a year later			1
this time , merry the cat was found stuck in a tree close to home but thankfully @entity18 , who now has five cats , has n't needed the pendulum again for his own pets			1
but the dowsing enthusiast is clearly in high demand as up to three or four people a day contact him for his help			0
he said : ' i saw some owners putting pleas for help on the @entity125 charity @entity126 after their cats went missing			2
i thought i could help these people out , and in october i posted an offer to dowse for cats on the charity 's lost and found @entity45 page			2
' so far i have done it thirty times - for some owners i 've done it once or twice , and for others i have done it for them many times			0
' up until now i 've managed to find a missing cat in @entity140 and another in the @entity142 area			1
the owners were absolutely over the moon , they could n't believe it			0
' the owner of the cat found in @entity142 went exactly to the estate where i told her to go and at first there was no luck			2
' but when she went back a second time , she shouted for her and the cat just walked up to her from out of nowhere			0
mr @entity18 used his psychic powers to find his own pet cat @entity89 nearly four years ago when it went missing mr @entity18 is confident his methods can be most effective to help owners find their lost pets ' that was really spooky			1
' after that it has just sort of snowballed from there			0
i 've even had people messaging me to help find their dogs			0
' i do try to help people as often as i can but it 's usually no more than a few times a week after work in my spare time			0
' he added : ' i had heard of dowsing rods but the first time i heard about dowsing using a pendulum was when i saw someone on the tv using one to find a lost child			1
' i decided to try it for myself and at first , i got my son to hide a push pop around the house			0
using a map of the house that i drew and the pendulum i bought on @entity28 , i managed to find where he had hidden it			2
' although @entity18 admits that dowsing is a more unconventional way of finding lost pets , he tells sceptics to give it a try first			1
he said : ' it is unusual			0
if i had never heard of it before i would think that i 'm losing the plot ! ' i 've been dowsing for four years now and finding the cats has totally proved to me that it does work			1
it could be a ghost pushing the pendulum for all i know			0
' i ca n't explain it and i do n't know how it actually works , but it does , and i 'm going to keep on doing it as long as i 'm helping people			0
' give it a go and see for yourself			0

@entity18 , 48 , says he found four cats using his pendulum and a photo

mr @entity18 used *technique* to find his own missing cat four years ago
