by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 21:14 est , 7 november 2012 updated : 21:14 est , 7 november 2012 the election may be over but contest continues to drag on in @entity5 , where the presidential race between @entity7 and @entity8 was still too close to call - a full day after polls opened			1
more than 24 hours after polls closed in @entity5 , election officials said votes were still being counted in a handful of counties and final results may not be known before this weekend			1
' every county must report their unofficial results to us by saturday at noon , ' said @entity19 , a spokesman for @entity5 's secretary of state , who is responsible for elections			1
twelve years ago , when the key battleground state was a toss - up that left the presidential race unsettled , @entity5 was the cause of electoral gridlock			2
this time , it hardly seemed to matter			0
president @entity7 handily won re-election without @entity5 's 29 @entity48 votes , which was the biggest prize up for grabs in any of the @entity40 swing states			1
as of wednesday evening , @entity7 had 49.87 per cent of the statewide vote versus 49.27 per cent for @entity8 , with just 49,963 votes separating them , according to the @entity5 @entity54			1
waiting game : @entity5 officials could not predict when the votes would be counted , but some suggest results would not be revealed until this weekend long lines : @entity5 election law says that anyone who was in line when the polls closed at 7pm could still have their votes counted frustration : hundred of voters waited in long lines to cast their ballots on @entity70 in @entity71 on tuesday night officials throughout the state blamed an unexpectedly high number of absentee ballots and the length of the ballots , which included 11 proposed state constitutional amendments , for long lines at polling places and delays in tallying final results			1
but @entity84 governor @entity84 's decision not to extend early voting ahead of @entity70 , after it was cut back from 14 to eight days by @entity84 and the @entity86 - controlled @entity85 , was also cited as causing exceedingly long voter lines at many precincts on tuesday			2
@entity89 have said repeatedly that the cutback was a part of an unsuccessful attempt to blunt turnout in @entity5 by @entity7 supporters			1
@entity96 mayor @entity95 apologized for the long lines in his county on wednesday , after acknowledging that some voters had been forced to wait up to six hours to cast their ballots			1
chaos : an aerial view above a polling place in @entity71 shows the line of voters that extended into the parking lot queues : in @entity5 , polling places that closed at 7pm remained open , as hundreds of people lined the streets in some areas , waiting to get in ' that should not have happened , ' said @entity95 , whose county accounts for about 10 percent of @entity5 's nearly 12 million registered voters			2
as for the glacially pace of the vote count , @entity95 said : ' we had a very long ballot			2
it was the longest ballot in @entity5 history			0
' the final margin of victory in @entity5 may be less than a percentage point			0
some political pundits say the delays highlight @entity5 's seeming inability to hold elections that are free of controversy and public mockery			0
' there are so many different potential sources of interference and conscious efforts to muck it up , we wo n't know for a while yet who to point the finger at , ' said @entity139 , a former political consultant based in @entity71			0
' we could have been there in the bulls - eye of the whole works looking idiotic just like last time , ' he said , referring to 2000 , when @entity143 won @entity5 by 537 and captured the @entity144			0
' we may be just as idiotic this time , but it does n't matter because no one is watching , ' @entity139 said			0
' last time , we held up the entire country			0

official results may not be known until the weekend
@entity5 vote marred by long lines and waits of up to six hours
@entity7 was handily re-elected without *needing* any of the 29 votes up for grabs in the @entity5
