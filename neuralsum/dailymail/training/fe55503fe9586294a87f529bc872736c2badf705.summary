by @entity0 geologists believe they have found the youngest remains of the oldest and largest impact crater on the planet			1
the discovery was made in @entity8 ’s @entity7 impact crater which was formed when a 6 mile ( 10 km ) meteorite slammed into it 2 billion years ago			1
until now , scientists had thought all of the ‘ impact melt ’ rocks had been eroded away as 6 miles ( 10km ) of @entity7 has already disappeared since it formed			1
geologists believe they have found the youngest remains of the oldest and largest impact crater on the planet			2
the discovery was made in @entity8 's @entity7 impact crater which was formed when a 6 miles ( 10 km ) meteorite slammed into it 2 billion years ago but researchers at the @entity21 in @entity22 , @entity23 , claim they have found ‘ definitive evidence ’ that dikes in the centre of the crater were as young as the crater itself			1
scientists hope the finding of @entity7 's impact melt could help researchers search for even older impact craters to reveal more secrets about the @entity35 's history			1
the impact crater was once thought to be much bigger at about 185 miles ( 300 km ) across , according to a report by @entity38 writing in @entity39			2
when the meteorite hit , it caused a thousand - megaton blast of energy			0
the heat from impact was enough to melt the @entity35 ’s crust creating a magma lake			1

the interrupted line circle , 300 km in diameter , marks the extent of the original crater two billion years ago a huge meteorite hit the @entity35 about 100km southwest of @entity56 creating the @entity7 impact crater			1
the meteorite , larger than @entity59 , caused a thousand - megaton blast of energy			0
the impact would have vaporised about 70 cubic kilometres of rock			0
the heat from impact was enough to melt the @entity35 ’s crust creating a magma lake			2
the world has about 130 crater structures of possible impact origin			0
the @entity50 is among the top three , and is the oldest and largest clearly visible meteorite impact site in the world			0
what remains of the event are impact - related rocks composed of broken fragments of minerals formed just after impact			2
what remains of the event are impact - related rocks composed of broken fragments of minerals formed just after impact			0
in the 1990s , professor @entity81 of @entity21 accidently discovered 2 - billion - year - old zircons — tiny minerals – which had no signs of violent shocks			1
but immediately after its discovery , geologists came out to disprove that the minerals found in the dikes were remains of @entity7 's impact melt			1
professor @entity81 recently returned to @entity8 to provide concrete evidence that the magma dikes were as young as the crater itself			2
the geologist and his team found that the zircons were intertwined with their surrounding materials , which means they could n’t have formed from the heat of impact			0
they also found levels of the element hafnium , which suggests that the magma melted from the 3 - billion - year - old rocks originally on top of the crater			1
professor @entity81 told live science : ‘ what @entity7 teaches us is that we have n't been looking with the right set of eyes at some of these ancient rocks			0
’ the world has about 130 crater structures of possible impact origin			0
the @entity50 ( pictured ) is among the top three , and is the oldest and largest clearly visible meteorite impact site in the world			0
