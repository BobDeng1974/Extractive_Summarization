residents of @entity1 have lashed out at their local council after they erected a less than spectacular christmas tree on the middle of a roundabout			1
standing on the corner of @entity7 and @entity8 is what locals have dubbed the @entity11 of @entity1			1
the lopsided tree , which is stripped of its branches on the lower half and adorned with crude decorations , was decorated by @entity1 council workers last week			1

' very difficult to do a street party here			0
the tree is on a roundabout at the busiest cbd intersection on an @entity40 road , ' they said			0
meanwhile , mayor @entity41 told @entity42 : ' it 's a bit @entity43 - like @entity1 itself ' a huge christmas tree stands in @entity46 in @entity47			1
by comparison , it 's a little kinder on the eyes @entity52 parks co-ordinator @entity51 told @entity53 the lopsided tree was chosen on purpose			2
' the tree is a @entity58 pine @entity60 columnaris and they all actually have a slightly natural screw or 's ' shape , so they naturally tend to lean , ' he said			2
' it is likely a lot of effort was put into selecting this species , as it would grow tall but it would not spread , which was important due to the power lines it grows within , ' @entity52 reportedly has a $ 15,000 yearly budget for @entity72 decorations , while many comparable outer suburban metropolitan councils in have budgets 10 times that amount .			0
