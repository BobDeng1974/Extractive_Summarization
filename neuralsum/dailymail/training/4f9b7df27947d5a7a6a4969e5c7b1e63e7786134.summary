by @entity0 one is almost black and has an afro			0
the other is a blonde with the palest skin			2
yet remarkably , @entity4 and @entity5 , from @entity6 , @entity7 , are twins , born six minutes apart			1
the pair , who could hardly look less alike , owe their appearance to a one in a million combination of their parents ’ genes			2
@entity4 , left , and @entity5 , right , from @entity6 in @entity7 , are twins , but have completely different skin tones and colour hair the chances of having a set of twins like @entity5 and @entity4 , who were born just six minutes apart in october 2005 , are a million to one mother @entity20 has white parents and father @entity22 has a black father and white mother			1
the staggering result is a two - tone set of little boys			2
now aged eight , the boys have the same cheeky smile and like to dress in the same clothes			2
they can not spend a night without each other and are rarely seen apart			0
their parents , both 50 , said they were blessed with the boys , who are both beautiful in their different ways			2
mrs @entity20 , a full - time carer , said : ‘ when @entity5 popped out after @entity4 the midwife and the nurses were utterly shocked			1
the doctor said he had never seen anything like it			0
‘ we ’ve been told it is very unusual , and people are always amazed when we tell them they are both twins			2
‘ after they popped out , @entity43 just shouted to me , ' we ’ve got one of each ' , and i could n’t believe it			0
@entity5 was so dark and @entity4 was lily white			1
@entity4 , left , was born ' lily white ' while @entity5 , right , was born ' so dark ' , their parents say they might look different - but their mother mrs @entity20 said it 's easy to tell the boys are brothers when they play together the two boys have looked different since they were born and have spent their childhood being questioned over the way they look each year , around 12,000 sets of twins are born in @entity56			1
of these , 385 of them are black or mixed race			0
the odds of a mixed race couple having twins of dramatically different colour are a million to one			1
skin colour is believed to be determined by up to seven different genes working together			2
if a woman is of mixed race , her eggs will usually contain a mixture of genes coding for both black and white skin			2
similarly , a man of mixed race will have a variety of different genes in his sperm			0
when these eggs and sperm come together , they will create a baby of mixed race			0
but , very occasionally , the egg or sperm might contain genes coding for one skin colour			2
if both the egg and sperm contain all white genes , the baby will be white			0
and if both contain just the versions necessary for black skin , the baby will be black			2
for a mixed - race couple , the odds of either of these scenarios is around 100 to one			0
but both scenarios can occur at the same time if the woman conceives non-identical twins - another 100 to one chance			1
this involves two eggs being fertilised by two sperm at the same time , which also has odds of around 100 to one			0
if a sperm containing all - white genes fuses with a similar egg , and a sperm coding for purely black skin fuses with a similar egg , two babies of dramatically different skin colours are born			1
‘ it ’s when they play together that you can tell they are brothers			0
’ the couple , who have been together since they were 12 - years - old , have five other children , @entity119 , 34 , @entity120 , 18 , @entity121 , 15 , @entity20 , 13 and @entity122 , 11			1
@entity119 , @entity120 and @entity122 are almost black , whereas @entity121 and @entity20 are pale white			1
the twins , their youngest children , were born six minutes apart in october 2005			1
@entity4 was born first and weighed two pounds heavier than @entity5			1
now @entity5 is quite a bit bigger than @entity4 and likes to take care of him			1
but while they watch out for one another , they enjoy doing different things , explained @entity4			1
he said : ‘ i ’m white , i ’m like me mam			0
i like watching @entity135 but @entity5 does n’t like it , he likes playing football			1
i like tennis and he likes playing with his friends			0
’ mr @entity5 , who is currently not working after suffering a stroke , said : ‘ we were chuffed , shocked and so surprised when they came out			1
i was completely made up			2
‘ it was hard getting them back off the nurses			0
’ mr @entity5 said the younger of the two was very protective of his brother			1
he said : ' @entity4 has learning difficulties so @entity5 is very protective of him			1
‘ @entity5 has been bullied in the past for the colour of his skin , but we tell him to just walk away			1
‘ people have asked whether @entity4 is my adopted son , they would say ' he ca n’t be yours '			1
' it is when they hear him shout ' @entity156 ' and then people just ask and they find it unbelievable			0
‘ i think it is better they are different , they get on so well and they ca n’t be separated			0
they curl up in bed together like they are still in their mother ’s womb			0
’ ' one of each ' : the eight - year - old twins owe their unusual appearance to a combination of their parents ' genes their parents @entity20 , pictured left , and @entity22 , pictured right , both 50 , said the boys are both ' beautiful in their different ways ' each year , around 12,000 sets of twins are born in @entity56			1
the odds of a mixed race couple having twins of dramatically different colour - just like @entity4 and @entity5 - are a million to one			1
skin colour is believed to be determined by up to seven different genes working together			2
if a woman or man is of mixed race , their eggs or sperm will usually contain possible genes coding for black and white skin which , if they come together , will create a baby of mixed race			0
happy families : 8 - year - old twins @entity5 and @entity199 pictured with their parents @entity20 , left , and @entity200 , right , and their sister @entity20 , 13 , centre			1
the couple have seven children in total but , on rare occasions , the egg or sperm might just have coding for one skin colour			0
if this is the case in both the egg and the sperm , the baby will be white , or all black - depending on what coding the egg or sperm had			0
the odds of either of these scenarios is around 100 to one for a mixed - race couple			0
but , if the woman conceives non-identical twins , both scenarios can occur at the same time			0
there is about another 100 to one chance of this happening			0
this involves two eggs being fertilised by two sperm at the same time - which also has odds of around 100 to one			0
if a sperm containing all - white genes then fuses with a similar egg , while a sperm coding for purely black skin fuses with a similar egg , two babies of dramatically different skin colours will be born .			1

@entity4 and @entity5 were born six minutes apart in october 2005
the boys , from @entity6 , @entity7 , have completely different skin
the chance of having two twins who look so different is one in a million
@entity20 and @entity247 said midwives were ' utterly shocked '
