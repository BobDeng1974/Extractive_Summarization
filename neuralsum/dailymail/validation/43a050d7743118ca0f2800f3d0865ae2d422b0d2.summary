if you 've ever given blood , you 'll know that even the most skilled nurses and doctors can struggle to locate the vein first time			1
so hospitals in the @entity6 are trialling a device that can locate veins inside a person ’s arm using harmless near - infrared light			1
called @entity12 , the device detects veins and then projects the image of them in real - time on top of the arm to help the medical worker know where to put the needle			1
called @entity26 ( shown ) it uses infrared light to look ' under ' the skin			1
it can then project a high - definition image of the veins onto the surface of the skin			1
the device enables doctors and nurses to find a vein immediately the medical system was designed by @entity23 - based company @entity39			1
it shows a picture of your veins directly on your skin ’s surface , ‘ hopefully saving you from the unnecessary pain of multiple needle stings , ’ said the company			2
the device attaches to a movable arm that can be wheeled into position , to keep it steady while observing a patient ’s arm			0
it works by emitting near - infrared light , which is absorbed by hemoglobin in the blood and then reflected by surrounding tissue			1
the information is processed digitally by the unit , and projected in real - time onto the skin			2

a fine detail mode also increases the contrast in the image , bringing out more detailed vein formations			2
this can allow a clinician to find turns in a person 's veins , called bifurcations , and valves			1
the user can also take up to 200 static images of patient vasculature - the arrangement of blood vessels in the body			0
‘ only @entity26 can provide pre , during and post-access benefits throughout the entire vascular access procedure , ’ said @entity12 ’s president , @entity118			0
‘ it is also the only device of its kind that has been shown through clinical studies to increase both first - stick success and patient satisfaction by up to 100 per cent while reducing medically unnecessary [ catheter ] lines by over 30 percent			0

it has a cub - like face but packs enough strength to transfer patients from a wheelchair or a floor - level bed to a bath , for example			0
it weighs 309lb ( 140kg ) with extending legs that stop the ' bear ' from falling over and it moves slowly and smoothly thanks to advance actuators in its mechanical arms			0
@entity142 was developed by the @entity157 in @entity158 , @entity159 .			0

a @entity23 - based company has released a system to observe veins
called @entity26 it uses infrared light to look under skin
it can then project an @entity171 image of the veins onto the surface of the skin
device enables doctors and nurses to find a vein immediately
it also *highlights* *features* such as bifurcations and valves
