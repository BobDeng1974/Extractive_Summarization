police bail will be capped at 28 days to end people languishing in legal limbo			2
@entity3 ( pictured ) was held on pre-charge bail for 12 months before being told he would face no further action police bail is to be capped at 28 days to end the ' scandal ' of people languishing in a legal limbo			1
ministers will today set out plans to reform the law which means there is currently no restriction on the amount of time that police can keep someone on pre-charge bail			1
lawyers and campaigners have warned that innocent people are being waiting for years before seeing their cases being dropped or thrown out of court			1
deputy prime minister @entity23 has led demands for a change in the law in @entity28 talks			0
the @entity29 will today set out two options for reform , both of which will mean a magistrate having to approve bail of more than three months and a judge in a @entity37 having to agree to it being extended beyond a year			1
there is a coalition split over how to reform shorter bail periods , however			0
conservative ministers are understood to be arguing that after a police inspector puts someone on bail up to 28 days , a chief superintendent should then be able to extend it to three months			2
@entity48 , however , say the power to keep people on bail beyond 28 days should be removed from police altogether and a magistrate should have to sign off an extension to a period up to three months			1
pre-charge bail was introduced in the @entity57 , which gave police the power to put someone who has been arrested under bail while they gather additional evidence			1
before the change , people suspected of crimes had to be held in prison while officers investigated allegations against them			2
however , there is no time limit on pre-charge bail as the law stands â€“ meaning police can roll it on for months or even years while they determine whether they can gather enough evidence to persuade prosecutors to bring charges			1
civil liberty campaigners say the law has increasingly been abused , leaving people in limbo for months and undermining the principle that they are ' innocent until proven guilty '			2
people caught up in long - running police bail can lose their careers and have the fear of potential charges hanging over them with no known decision date			2
of around 70,000 people are currently on pre-charge bail in @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93 , more than 5,000 are thought to have been on bail for more than six months			1
the issue has gained prominence because of a number of high - profile cases including that of dj @entity3 , who was held on pre-charge bail for 12 months over alleged historical sex offences before being told that there was no basis for further action			1
deputy prime minister @entity23 ( left ) has led demands for a change in the law in @entity28 talks , and senior @entity109 including former home office minister @entity110 ( right ) have backed the campaign some journalists accused of phone hacking , meanwhile , have been left on police bail for more than two years			0
@entity109 have backed the calls for a change in the law , including @entity110 , a former @entity29 minister , @entity119 , the former shadow home secretary , and sir @entity121 , the former solicitor general			0
they signed a campaign letter earlier this month which warned : ' innocent people have been left on pre-charge bail for years before their cases have been dropped or thrown out of court			1
' this is a scandal			0
those on it have their careers put on hold			0
the mental anguish of not knowing what will happen to them is in itself a form of punishment without trial : the weight of suspicion grows heavier with each day			0
' all these individuals are innocent until proven guilty			0
it is a fundamental axiom that justice delayed is justice denied			0
' the @entity29 will today announce a consultation on bringing in a 28 - day cap on the amount of time someone can be held on police bail without approval from the authorities , a @entity145 source said			1
' there is going to be a statutory limit , ' the source added			0
' there are going to be two models : either a chief superintendent or a magistrate will have to sign off bail up to three months , and then a magistrate will have to be persuaded of the case up to 12 months and a @entity37 judge beyond that			1
' there may have to be exemptions for complex fraud cases , tax evasion or historical sex abuse cases which can take a long time to investigate			1
' but it ca n't be right that people are spending months and years waiting to find out they are never going to be charged			2
' @entity174 president @entity173 said people are often left ' in the wilderness ' while police decide whether they should be charged with a crime			0
' @entity179 has been calling for a statutory limit on length of time the police are able to keep suspects on bail , often with conditions , before they are charged with a criminal offence , ' he said			0
' not only does keeping someone on police bail interfere with their liberty ; it also means that police investigations can be protracted and slow , making the justice system less efficient and with a negative effect on complainants and witnesses			0
we support there being a statutory limit of 28 days , after which the police should apply to a magistrate for an extension where this can be shown to be necessary			0

campaigners have warned people can be on pre-charge bail for years
the @entity29 will today set out two options for reforming the system
in both a magistrate would have to approve bail of more than three months
@entity37 judge would do the same to extend it beyond a year
