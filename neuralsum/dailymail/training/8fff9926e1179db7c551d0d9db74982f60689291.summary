a real life @entity1 father of three started a cannabis factory to support his family after losing his home and livelihood following a tumour operation			1
@entity8 , a 40 - year - old father of three , was hoping to copy @entity10 crime drama chemistry teacher @entity9 , who builds a @entity12 drug crystal meth empire after he is diagnosed with cancer			1
however @entity8 , who had been forced to leave the car - valeting business he part - owned when an operation to remove a golf - ball sized lump in his neck left him unable to work , did n't have a clue about cannabis			1
the former glass factory worker , who lives in the small former coal - mining town of @entity22 in @entity23 with children @entity25 , six , @entity26 , 11 , @entity27 , 16 , and wife @entity28 , did n't even know how he was going to sell his crop			1
' it was not something i had ever done before			2
i was going on the net to see when it was ready and i was just playing it by ear			1
' he added : ' i do n't like the stuff			1
i do n't smoke fags or anything			1
apparently that went against me in court			2
if i smoked it i could have said it was for personal use			2
' he pleaded guilty in @entity51 last week - and faces sentence on october 10 after police found 23 plants in the property			1
@entity8 was caught when a friend rang police in front of him after an argument			1
' i do n't why he did it , ' he said			1
' it was spur of the moment and he was sorry after			0
' at the time , his debt had spiralled to £ 50,000 and he was hoping to make thousands from the drugs venture			0
his life had fallen apart after his operation , which left him unable to work			1
' the lump turned out to be benign , ' he said			0
' but i had to have an operation that lasted seven or eight hours to have it removed			1
i still can not feel part of my neck because it went so deep			0
' i never went back to work because i was recovering from that			0
at the time i had a mortgage and everything was great			0
' by 2008 he had lost his home in @entity80 , @entity81 - which was valued at about £ 80,000 - and later moved to @entity82 , near @entity22			1
he had only initially been to the doctors to get medication for his sinuses			0
a police photo shows the cannabis plants that were confiscated from @entity8 ' property in the drug raid ' the doctor said to me : " what is that lump on your neck ? '' @entity8 said			1
' it was by my ear , on the side of my neck by my ear			0
on the side of my cheek basically			0
' i said i had been there twice and had been told there was nothing wrong with it			0
but it had grown in size			0
' he then began growing his cannabis from seeds he bought over the internet			1
' i paid £ 50 for the tents and the lights were about £ 50 each			0
it cost me about £ 250 in total			0
i borrowed that off a mate			0
it must have been going on for about three or four months			0
' there must have been about three or four weeks ( to go ) until they were ready			1
' the former glass factory worker was inspired by @entity124 cop show @entity122 and when officers raided his home , they were overwhelmed by the smell			2
the cannabis plants pictured as they were growing in @entity8 ' attic			1
officers said the smell was overpowering ' i managed to get five or six in the car , ' he said			2
' as i walked downstairs the police were there at the front and the back			2
i went back in the bedroom and did n't answer the door			1
' they found the plants in the bedroom and the attic and the six in the car			1
they could have seized the car			2
i had to get everything out and put it all in the police vans			2
' there were 23 in total			2
fifteen in the attic , two in the bedroom and six in the car			1
' his wife was terrified after hearing what had happened			0
he said : ' we have been together for 16 years			0
she was in bits because she was in work at the time it happened			0
she said , " @entity163 , we could lose the kids ! " ' the solicitor said they will not jail me under the circumstances because i 've no previous at all for anything			0
he thought it would be a suspended sentence for a year or community service or a fine or whatever			0
' not seeing my kids and the rest of the family - i do n't know how i would cope			2
' @entity8 now insisted his criminal career was over			1
' i would never do this again , ' he said			0
no way in the whole wide world			0
the thing is , how many other people are out there in my position , with no money and on the edge of doing something like this ? ' or if they have got to take two or three jobs to survive and they have got debt collectors on the door , ' @entity8 said			1
' how many people are doing this and have not been caught ? '			2
