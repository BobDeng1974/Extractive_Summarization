@entity5 and @entity6 captured the nation 's emotions with their news that she was pregnant with quadruplets after spending eight years trying to conceive - a one in 70 million chance			2
but on monday , it emerged that one set of twins had contracted twin - to - twin transfusion syndrome ( @entity16 ) - a condition which affects identical twins , causing an unequal flow of blood between the twins			1
tonight , after hours of surgery , the couple revealed on @entity40 that doctors have recorded steady heartbeats for all four of the unborn babies			2
they added : ' @entity44 is good ! prayers have been answered ! ! miracles continue to take place			0
all the babies survived the surgery , they heard 4 heartbeats today ! we want to thank all of you for being part of our miracle ! ! we do n't know how to say thank you enough ! ! xoxo ' ' we have n't slept much the past few days , ' @entity6 told @entity58			2
he said doctors told his wife she needed immediate surgery after it appeared her cervix had started to open and she could be going into early labor			2
on wednesday , doctors performed the emergency surgery to more equally divert blood flow between one set of the @entity6 twins			1

' @entity69 , a @entity70 woman ( pictured here recently ) who captured the nation with her news that she was pregnant with quadruplets after spending eight years trying to conceive has been rushed to hospital for emergency surgery - it was a success according to the family @entity5 pictured in a photo last week at 19 weeks			1
according to a @entity40 page which updates their followers @entity5 and @entity6 , from @entity70 , flew to see a specialist surgeon in @entity83 yesterday following a meeting with their doctor about their two sets of identical twins the family posted this message to their @entity40 today after the successful surgery the couple also found out that @entity5 's cervix is opening prematurely as a result of the condition			1
@entity5 underwent surgery today and was given ' meds to halt any contraction that might occur			1
' a few hours later the anxious family revealed the surgery went well			0
they posted on @entity40 : ' it went great			0
dr. @entity104 smiled and said , ' this has been a good day ! ' our tears have been replaced with relief and continue to pray for the babies safety and continued ' baking ' for a good long time ! ! stunned : this is the moment @entity5 and @entity6 , for @entity70 , found out they were having quadruplets in the summer after spending eight years trying to conceive			2
above , mrs @entity69 stares at the screen in the ultrasound 70 - million - to - one odds : the couple were delighted to learn their first round of @entity120 was successful in july following a long battle with infertility			1
but they were later stunned to discover they were having four babies caught on camera : their incredible reaction to the news was captured in hospital by friend @entity131 twin to twin transfusion is caused by an abnormal connecting of blood vessels in the twins ' shared placenta which results in an imbalance of blood flow from one twin to the other			1
it affects approximately 15 % of identical twins who share the same placenta			1
one twin is often larger than the other twin and receives more blood than usual from the placenta			2
this can put a strain on the baby 's heart and makes this twin produce more urine than normal , resulting in extra fluid around the baby , within the amniotic sac			0
this can be uncomfortable for the mother and also increases the risk to the pregnancy by causingpremature labour due to the extra pressure on the neck of the womb ( cervix )			0
the other twin is usually smaller and may become anaemic due to receiving less blood from the placenta			2
the treatments for @entity16 pregnancies depend , in part , on when in pregnancy the twins become affected			1
if the twins are mature enough to survive outside the womb ( beyond 25 weeks ) , immediate delivery is an option for @entity16 babies			1
fetal laser surgery may be done to stop the flow of blood from one twin to the other			1
another treatment is amnioreduction - a procedure whereby fluid is taken from around the twin with polyhydramnios to try and prevent premature delivery			2
a needle is passed through the abdomen into the sac of the recipient twin and fluid removed			0
