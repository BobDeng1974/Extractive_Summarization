by @entity0 a boy who grew up on the land in country @entity4 and went on to serve in @entity6 's @entity5 for nearly four decades , @entity1 recalled the moment that would the set the course for the rest of his life			1
he remembers watching the planes flying high and low across his parent 's farm but admitted ' i never imagined i could be a pilot or even that it was within reach			0
' then one day , ' i was out in the paddocks just on the tractor and this @entity20 ( aircraft ) nearly took my wheel stack off			0
and i thought you know , that 's really exciting ' , mr @entity1 told @entity24			2
retired air commodore @entity1 has penned a novel detailing his experiences after nearly four decades in the @entity6 @entity5 ' that person has made a decision and i have not , i 'm sitting here annoyed with my life and that person has clearly made a decision to do something about theirs ' , he said speaking of the plane 's pilot			1
from there , with the mentality that ' normal human beings do this , i 'm a normal being , i can do it ' a young mr @entity1 - barely into his 20s - put in an application to join the @entity43 , an application which he says ' changed his life '			2
in his new book @entity48 , retired air commodore mr @entity1 puts on paper his 35 year career in the military and then the @entity52 , but also tells of the emotional impact war has on not just individuals , but their families too			1
' the key point here is the families , when we go off we know what we 're doing , ( but ) they 've got no idea because we either do n't have the time to tell them , or ca n't tell them , or we just do n't think to tell them ' , mr @entity1 revealed			1
mr @entity1 , pictured in sunglasses , commanded the first @entity6 response team to the @entity68 in @entity69 , the worst affected city on the northwest coast of @entity72 in the book , flight command , mr @entity1 recalls the horrific devastation that swept the country after the natural disaster ' i 'm hoping this is the story of the feelings that arise when you do interesting things in remarkable places ... and certainly my goal is to enrich the dialogue in society about defence and military people			1
' mr @entity1 said he hopes his book will bring greater understanding about the @entity6 military and defence forces from the tough call mr @entity1 made one night when he decided to go to the @entity94 , to the complete and utter devastation which came in the wake of the @entity68 in @entity72 , flight command is an exploration of the full experience of serving on the front line			1
he was in command of the first @entity6 team to touch down and offer aid after the natural disaster , and said there was no other way to describe the tsunami other than totally and utterly destructive			0
' we saw rivers of corpses , bloated blackened corpses , all mixed into the detritus , with new cars and old , building materials and humans			0
children , men , women , everything all mixed up ' , mr @entity1 recalled			2
' we saw , and smelt the ugliness and the consequence of this dragon coming out of the sea and destroying everything in front of it			0
' and i truly use the word dragon because when you look at it , you think there 's only one thing that could have done that and that 's a dragon that came out of the water and just ate the land , ' he said			0
scenes like this can be overwhelming and just as destructive for those who are there providing relief , and the retired @entity1 told of the heartbreaking moment one of his fellow servicemen was unable to cope when confronted with such a horrific situation			2
from never even daring to dream he could be a pilot to serving in two wars , mr @entity1 says applying for the military at age 20 changed his life the novel also reveals the heartbreak of losing mates in battle , and the emotional toll war takes on all those who come into contact with it ' when we went to the tsunami one of my colleagues was in a moment of intense personal stress and ended up taking his own life , and we found out while we were in the middle of it			1
' we had such high regard for our colleague and we were so hurt by the fact that he made this choice and we were n't given the chance to help him through it			0
' this emotional toll is one that anyone who serves in the @entity5 has no choice but to live with - and one that mr @entity1 said can be an enormous burden , and many of the psychological injuries sustained in battle can last a lifetime			1
' in every moment , you leave the moment damaged in some way			0
and then of that , let 's say you walk away with a lump of damage of 100 percent , 80 percent of that will get fixed over time and goes away			0
mr @entity1 , pictured second from left , tells of the impact that being forced into an early retirement had on his life mr @entity1 served in the @entity94 , in the conflict in the middle east during a career which spanned 35 years ' but there 'll be a little bit that 's left , that last 20 percent which is left and sort of stays in the background			1
you ca n't ever put that back in the bank , it 's damage which goes on forever			0
' over time however , mr @entity1 learned to deal with the burden of this , despite the many pressures it put on his family			2
and through the horror of war and disaster mr @entity1 said human joy in it 's most raw and deep form is always there			1
' in the middle of the most dire disaster is always the most beautiful human experiences			0
always you will see the absolute best and absolute worst in those dire moments			0
' they 're not shallow moments of joy , they 're truly deep and meaningful moment ' , he revealed			0
