by @entity0 published : 19:43 est , 12 november 2013 updated : 03:28 est , 13 november 2013 the report by @entity3 medical director professor sir @entity2 , above , was commissioned by the government in a bid to ward off fears of an @entity8 crisis a huge shake - up of health care provision was heralded last night by the @entity3 ’s top doctor			1
professor sir @entity2 announced plans for a ‘ two - tier ’ casualty service with ‘ super a&es ’ dealing with life - threatening conditions			1
but fears are growing that his reforms will only lead to confusion among patients , who will not know which hospital to attend			2
the three key planks of his reforms will set up distinction between super a&es and standard a&es , ask @entity26 to provide more same - day appointments as well as opening surgeries in the evenings and at weekends and bolster the 111 helpline with more doctors , nurses and pharmacists answering the phone			1
sir @entity2 ’s vision is set out in a report , published today , on how to improve @entity8 and other ‘ urgent care ’ such as gp services			0
the government asked him last winter to draw it up			0
in the biggest shake - up in @entity8 departments for 40 years , up to half of the 140 units in @entity43 will be transformed into ‘ major emergency centres ’			2
they will provide specialised care for the victims of strokes , heart attacks , suspected brain haemorrhages and other life - threatening conditions			1
the rest will stay as standard casualty units mainly treating the elderly , broken bones , drunks and less critical patients			1
but @entity61 , co-director of @entity62 , said : ‘ this will just confuse patients even more			0
patients do n’t know whether they are suffering from a heart attack or a bout of indigestion			0
‘ a healthcare professional should be telling them , but if they ca n’t get an appointment with their gp how will they know ? the reason there is huge demand in @entity8 is that gps have been allowed to operate a nine - to - five service			0
‘ it strikes me that this report is all about how to provide care at the lowest possible costs rather than being about what ’s best for patients			1
’ health secretary @entity84 , above , said he would not shy away from making ' difficult decisions ' where the @entity3 is concerned and the @entity86 , which represents casualty doctors , said that critically - ill patients would have to travel further to super a&es , potentially delaying their treatment			1
the shake - up – overseen by sir @entity2 , the @entity3 ’s medical director – has been announced at a time of growing problems for @entity8 units , which are grappling with soaring numbers of patients and shortages of senior doctors			1
within the next three to five years , they will be designated as either ‘ emergency centres ’ – meaning that essentially they will stay the same – or ‘ major emergency centres ’ , which will deal with the most seriously ill patients			0
sir @entity2 , who said ‘ doing nothing was not an option ’ , estimates that there will be between 40 and 70 super a&es			1
they are most likely to be in hospitals which already have specialised stroke and heart attack centres with top doctors on hand			0
the report prompted speculation that dozens of the lower - tier @entity8 units will be downgraded			1
but sir @entity2 insisted this would not be the case , although patients suffering from life - threatening conditions would be transferred to super a&es			1
he added that at this stage there were no plans to close @entity8 units			0
‘ @entity8 is creaking at the seams , ’ said sir @entity2			0
‘ it ’s not broken but it is struggling			0
‘ in many senses , our a&es have become victims of their own success because they function as a safety net for people who are worried , frightened , anxious or in pain and therefore have problems that concern them			0
when a&es become very busy it means other parts of the system are creaking as well , they are under stress			2
‘ it ’s against that background that there ’s a feeling this winter will be difficult			0
’ sir @entity2 hopes that @entity26 , paramedics and @entity3 staff will ensure patients are sent to the most appropriate @entity8 unit			1
he also wants to reduce the numbers of patients turning up in casualty by making it easier for them to get a @entity71 appointment and making surgeries stay open during the evening and at weekends			0
shadow health secretary @entity158 , above , said the report does not address the impending crisis it is not yet clear how he will encourage @entity26 to work out - of - hours without changing their contracts			1
the government is currently holding talks with senior family doctors over changes to their contract , which could see them having to take back responsibility for patients during the evening and at weekends			2
sir @entity2 also plans to beef - up the @entity3 helpline and recruit more doctors , nurses and pharmacists to offer expert advice to patients rather than untrained call centre staff			1
when the helpline started operating in the spring there were concerns it led to more patients turning up in @entity8 because they were given the wrong advice by staff or gave up in frustration			2
at present , most patients phoning the number speak to a call - centre worker with limited experience and training who reads through a script			2
@entity3 officials want to improve the helpline drastically so that when patients ring it they are given medical guidance that is good enough to mean they do not have to go to hospital			1
in his report , sir @entity2 says he wants @entity3 111 to be ‘ the smart call to make ’			1
he also wants to give paramedics more training so they are capable of diagnosing patients on the scene and taking them to a specialist stroke or heart attack centre or just treating them at home			0
other plans would see gps being allowed to admit frail elderly patients straight to care homes rather than sending them to @entity8			0
health secretary @entity84 told the @entity212 yesterday that the government would not shy away from making ‘ difficult decisions ’			0
he said : ‘ we all know that the @entity3 needs to change to meet the needs of an ageing population			2
the reforms will set up distinction between super a&es , sir @entity2 said ‘ we know that change will not happen overnight and we ’ll work with @entity43 [ which runs the health service ] to ensure the @entity3 offers world - class standards of patient care			1
’ labour health spokesman @entity158 said the plans did not address the impending crisis facing many @entity8 units , which have too few doctors to deal with soaring numbers of patients			2
‘ ministers said this report would have lessons for the immediate winter as well as the longer term , ’ he said			0
‘ but they are failing to act and their response remains , “ crisis , what crisis ? ”			0
they are forcing @entity240 to go into winter with too few nurses , doctors and beds			2

two - tier system will define ' super a&es ' and ' standard a&es '
@entity26 are told to provide more same - day appointments for patients
@entity3 111 helpline will have more doctors , nurses and pharmacists
