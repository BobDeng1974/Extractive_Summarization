eerie photos have emerged of hundreds of retired aircraft parked in rows and set formations in aviation graveyards across @entity5			1
the ' boneyards ' in @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 are home to hundreds of retired commercial and military aircraft that are stored in the dry desert conditions to prevent them from going rusty			1
@entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 store planes at these bases , with the hope the planes will fly again			1
however many are eventually scrapped or used for spare parts			1
in the aftermath of the september 11th terrorist attacks , the airline industry suffered a drop in revenue which resulted in many older airplanes being taken out of service and grounded there are 11 major bases across the @entity5 that are used to store retired planes , yet these images are taken from largest and most densely populated bases			2
these are the @entity43 in @entity44 and the @entity45 ( @entity45 ) at @entity46 in @entity47 , @entity7 , @entity8 's @entity48 in @entity29 and the @entity49 , and the @entity50 in @entity51 , @entity9			1
the @entity43 is a public - use airport in @entity53 , @entity7 , around seven miles from the central business district of @entity44			2
the airpark is mainly used as a ' boneyard ' for commercial planes , and old airplanes are stored there with the hope that the desert climate will stop them from rusting			1
@entity43 covers an area of 2,080 acres and has single runway measuring 6,849 by 150 feet			0
the @entity28 is a public airport located in the city of @entity29 in @entity66			0
the facility was @entity68 between 1941 to 1992 and was used as a front - line @entity70 base an intact @entity72 aircraft sits in the shadows of a dismantled @entity75 aircraft at the @entity45 in @entity47 , @entity7			1
more than 2,500 aircraft from all services are stored at the centre			2
most of the aircraft are used for parts , returned to service , sold to foreign governments or donated to federal and state agencies the @entity55 is used as a parachute testing and training facility and in march @entity88 @entity87 was killed during parachute training at the facility , and another seal was injured			1
at the @entity45 at @entity46 there are more than $ 35billion ( £ 22billion ) worth of outdated planes kept as spare parts for current models			1
the base was named after @entity97 and @entity98 who died in military aircraft accidents during the @entity100			0
this shot is an aerial image of the @entity45 ( @entity45 ) located on the @entity46 in @entity7			2
@entity45 has approximately $ 35 billion ( £ 22 billion ) worth of aircraft , totalling around 4,500 planes , from all of various commercial and military companies the planes in @entity45 are used to replace more than 350,000 spare parts for active planes including engines , munitions , wiring and electronics			1
some planes are stored at the base between deployments but for more than 80 per cent of the 4,500 aircraft kept there are for parts			1
current military planes stored at the base include an intact @entity72 aircraft and dismantled @entity75 aircraft			1
staff at the facility recycle , on average , more than 19,000 parts worth $ 568million ( £ 366million ) and the @entity5 government allows the military in other countries to buy parts and planes from the site			2
major aircraft carriers in the @entity5 store dozens of passenger planes at the 5,000 - acre former air force base in @entity29 , @entity8			1
the planes are mix of retired planes and planes that have been temporarily discontinued due to budget constraints			2
the airport was used in films such as @entity143 ( 2002 ) and @entity144 ( 2003 ) the facility is the size of 1,300 football pitches and it was used in films such as @entity143 from 2002 and @entity144 in 2003			0

the @entity43 is a public - use airport in @entity53 , @entity7			0
it 's mainly used as a ' boneyard ' for commercial planes			1
old airplanes are stored there with the hope that the desert climate will stop them from rusting in case the aircraft is needed to fly again			1
however , the majority of aircraft taken to @entity43 are scrapped			0

aerial imagery taken from the @entity88 , @entity70 and @entity256 show retired airplane ' boneyards ' in @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9
the planes are stored in the dry conditions of the desert to stop them rusting in the hope that some may fly again whereas others are used for spare parts
large commercial planes including @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 aircraft are all pictured
