@entity12 explains : ' we started this work after observing the behaviour of people close to us and how they reacted to images			1
transformation : @entity12 and @entity24 use tears from magazines to create their work identity : the duo say that the works are intended to show how much people are influenced by the media bizarre : while some subjects are rendered beautiful , others are made strange by the cut out images ' magazines , cinema and television keep creating and imposing codes that become social references [ that dictate ] what you must look like , how you must do your make - up , what clothes you should wear , how you should behave and so on			1
' we are fascinated by the power of media to influence people 's identities			0
' to create their wonderfully bizarre photographs , the duo asked people to pose in their studio with eyes , lips and other facial features cut from magazines applied to their faces - an essential part of production , according to @entity62			0
' we worked directly with material coming from the media and magazines for this series , ' he explains			0
' we cut into [ photographed ] faces to tape them onto other faces , creating something strangely beautiful which makes you question your own identity			0
' challenging : the series of photographs makes you reconsider the way you see yourself for everyone : according to @entity62 , anyone who wants to can be part of series two of their project although the first set of photographs in the series is complete , the duo are currently working on the second set , entitled @entity89 , and are on the look out for models			2
' we do n't choose our models , ' says @entity12			2
' everybody can participate in this experience as far as we are concerned			0
