a primary school with more than 400 pupils has become the first in the country where no children speak @entity5 as their mother tongue			2
@entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and several @entity13 dialects are among the 20 foreign languages spoken at @entity15			1
but it has thrived in the face of adversity			2
only 14 months ago the school was rated ‘ inadequate ’ by @entity20 , the lowest of four ratings			2
last month it was upgraded to ‘ good ’ , the second highest			2
lesson in diversity : @entity25 with some of her pupils , who between them speak 20 foreign languages @entity15 headteacher @entity25 chats with her pupils			1
she oversees what is the most multi-cultural school in @entity30 , with not one of the 440 pupils listing @entity5 as their first language the school , in @entity34 , has adopted a string of measures to cope			1
teachers give ‘ running commentaries ’ , explaining everything they are doing so that pupils associate objects and actions with the words that describe them			2
a ‘ buddy system ’ is also in place with children in schools over the border in @entity50 so that pupils can benefit from having friends who are native @entity5 speakers			2
pupils study and play together at each other ’s schools once a fortnight			2
teachers are motivated by salaries that are linked to their performance , something education secretary @entity58 is introducing across the country from september in an attempt to drive up standards			1
@entity15 is believed to be the first in @entity30 where every single one of its pupils does not speak @entity5 as a first language , but more and more pupils across the country are now from foreign backgrounds			1
in a 2012 census of 1,600 schools , it was found @entity5 - speaking children are now in a minority , with the figures particularly startling in the 14 inner @entity80 boroughs , where there were 98,000 non-native @entity5 speakers compared to 78,000 who could list the language as their number one			1
nationwide , there were 97 schools where the number of pupils speaking @entity5 as a mother tongue was fewer than one in 20 of the school population			0
after @entity80 , @entity93 had the highest concentration of ' foreign ' pupils , followed by @entity96 and then @entity97			0
@entity98 was the most widely - spoken first language			1
head @entity25 , 54 , said : ‘ more and more of the world is going bilingual			0
the culture at our school is not to see bilingualism as a difficulty			0
’ often , she added , it is preferable for children to speak no @entity5 at all , rather than turn up with a mixture of @entity5 and their parents ’ language			1
‘ sometimes parents have tried to help their children learn @entity5 but their own is n’t too good , ’ she said			0
‘ the outcome is the children are n’t fluent in their own language			1
if they have n’t got a good foundation [ in their own language ] it can be very difficult to build on that			1
’ some 358 of the 440 pupils were raised speaking @entity7 , according to @entity121 figures			0
the language is used in parts of @entity124 and @entity125			1
another 23 are fluent in @entity126 , which is used in @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129			0
there are 15 @entity131 and 11 @entity132 , while other languages include @entity8 , @entity10 , @entity134 , @entity9 , @entity135 , @entity11 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 and four @entity13 dialects			0
the different language groups are accommodated using 28 teaching assistants , ten of whom speak @entity145 , who speaks some @entity7 after living in @entity124 with her teacher husband @entity147 in the 1990s plus some @entity138 and @entity136 , said : ‘ some children like to start trying out what they have learned straight away			1
‘ others have a silent period of up to six months while they are taking things in			0
then they start to talk with some fluency			0
it ’s lovely to hear			0
’ @entity155 , which is also in @entity34 , has 23 native languages spoken among its 592 pupils			1
only 24 children have @entity5 as a first language			1
despite the language barrier , @entity15 has been rated ' good ' by inspectors just a year after it was deemed ' inadequate ' several nationalities migrated to @entity34 in the last century , including @entity124 and @entity163			1
the city also saw a huge influx of @entity166 from 2004 when the @entity167 expanded and is now believed to be the fastest growing multi-ethnic community in @entity30			1
by 2007 there were 16,000 eastern @entity170 estimated to be living there , one in ten of the population			0
many of them arrived to work on farms and in food processing plants in the agricultural heartland			0
@entity178 said more than 100 languages are spoken in the area			0
more than a third of pupils speak @entity5 as a second language , up from one in five in 2008			2
the city ’s @entity185 mp , @entity184 , has warned that it is struggling to cope with the new arrivals			0
more are expected as families leave @entity80 because of the government ’s cap on housing benefits .			0

@entity15 in @entity34 most multi-cultural in @entity30
but language barrier has *n't* stopped major *improvement* in standards
