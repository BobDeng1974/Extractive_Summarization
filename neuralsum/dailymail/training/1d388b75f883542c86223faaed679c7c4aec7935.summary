by @entity0 @entity1 have fought off stiff competition from @entity3 to land the @entity5 midfielder @entity4 on a five - year deal			1
@entity3 had put together a £ 10 million package that would have put the 24 - year - old on a £ 50,000 - per - week package			1
that represented a huge wage rise from the basic £ 6,000 - a - week @entity4 was earning at @entity5 , where he has been since he was 10			2
decision : @entity4 has decided to sign with @entity1 rather than @entity3 got him : @entity13 beat off fierce competition to secure his man however the @entity1 fan is keen to stay in the @entity17 and that appears to have been a huge factor , with @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 all tracking the player			0
@entity4 's move to @entity25 from fierce rivals @entity5 , who were also keen to keep the player , is expected to be confirmed next week			0
he will become the first permanent signing made by @entity1 since january 2013 , but they will not have to pay a fee with @entity4 having run down his contract at the @entity32			0
disappointment : @entity33 's @entity3 was one of a number of teams who had been chasing the midfielder pay rise : @entity4 was paid just £ 6,000 - per - week at the @entity5			2

@entity4 has signed with @entity1
@entity3 offered the 24 - year - old £ 50,000 - per - week
huge *increase* on the £ 6,000 - per - week he was earning at @entity5
however @entity4 , a @entity1 fan , is keen to stay in the @entity17
