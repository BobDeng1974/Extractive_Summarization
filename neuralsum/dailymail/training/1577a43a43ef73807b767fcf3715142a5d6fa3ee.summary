by @entity0 published : 12:06 est , 31 december 2012 updated : 12:06 est , 31 december 2012 the initial k is synonymous with the @entity3 clan			0
so following news that @entity3 is expecting her first baby with @entity6 , the world is already imagining what name the couple will choose			1
@entity11 baby name expert , @entity10 , says that though @entity3 's sister @entity13 bucked the family trend , it is hard to imagine that she and @entity6 will be able to resist a k name for their unborn child			1
indeed , on @entity18 last year , @entity3 even admitted she was calling dibs on her favorite k names			0
will it be another k name ? @entity3 and @entity6 are expecting their first child younger sister @entity24 said in the episode : ' @entity3 is the only crazy person that would actually like , reserve			0
@entity28 and i like baby names , but i 'm not going to say , " no one else can have this name ! " ' with @entity3 's leaning towards that letter in mind , @entity11 has compiled a list of suggested monikers , based on current baby name trends and the various worlds from which the couple may take inspiration			1
@entity3 tradition : @entity13 ( left ) may have bucked the k name trend with @entity43 and @entity44 ( pictured ) , but @entity3 is unlikely to be able to resist by @entity10 @entity45 or @entity46 @entity6 ’s former fashion stylist was a 19 - year - old @entity48 undergrad named @entity49 - the white @entity49 - which might inspire the respelling of this @entity52 classic			1
@entity49 means hollow and recently reentered the top 1000 for the first time since 1895 ; the similar girls ’ name @entity46 means cinnamon , which makes it perfect for this spicy couple			1
@entity59 , @entity60 , or @entity61 @entity62 and @entity6 are both place - names , and so the couple might want to consider another off - the - map place name , such as the @entity59 , the @entity65 , or the @entity66 @entity61			2
@entity67 or @entity68 @entity6 is an @entity70 name , so it may make sense for the couple to look for another name of that origin			2
@entity67 is a @entity77 girls ’ name that means ' born after twins ' , while @entity68 is @entity79 for ' precious jewel '			0
@entity81 or @entity82 the @entity84 baby is sure to be gorgeous , and so one logical choice would be these female and male versions of the @entity88 name meaning ' beautiful '			2
while the k versions of the name modernize it @entity3 - style , there were three popes named @entity94 and a mythological nymph as well as the name of actress @entity97 giving weight to the trend			0
@entity100 , @entity101 or @entity102 music names ! @entity6 might want to wrap while @entity3 dances along to songs with musical names @entity106 , @entity101 , or @entity102 .			0
