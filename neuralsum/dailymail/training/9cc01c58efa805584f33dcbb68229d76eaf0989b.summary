by @entity0 besieged theme park @entity1 has launched its first major @entity3 attack against @entity4 in an attempt to offset almost 12 months of damage caused by the chilling documentary , which chronicled the aquarium 's 39 - year treatment of killer whales in captivity			1
hit with cancellations from high - profile performers and school field trips , coupled with aggressive animal activist campaigns and a tarnished image , the @entity13 - based marine park has placed full - page ads in eight of the country 's largest newspapers , rationalizing their whale practices			1
the ' @entity23 from @entity1 's animal advocates ' — which appears in today 's @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 , among other papers — defends the way @entity1 cares for the 29 whales in its corporate collection			1
although it does n't identify @entity4 , the ad is the first step in the company 's move to rebut the wide - spread criticisms raised by the film , such as allegations that captivity turned @entity41 - the world 's largest whale held in captivity - into a killer , according to the @entity25			1
tragedy : @entity4 focuses on a 12,000lb orca named @entity41 - the world 's largest killer whale held in captivity - who in 2010 dragged trainer @entity51 ( pictured with @entity52 ) underwater to her death at @entity1 in @entity13 , @entity55			1
@entity1 has staged a new campaign to react to the documentary 's allegations pr to the rescue : an excerpt of the letter @entity1 released as part of a new ad campaign in response to the negative criticism spawned by insightful documentary @entity4 @entity1 has previously dismissed the doco as propagandist and inaccurate			1
' @entity68 ' was responsible for the deaths of three people , most notably that of trainer @entity51 , who he grabbed and dragged underwater until she drowned during a 2010 training session in @entity55			1
the @entity76 - buzzing documentary - which details @entity41 's life , starting with being forcibly removed from his family in 1983 near @entity79 - claims the whale 's living conditions effectively turned him into an aggressive killer			2
it also includes scientific data saying there has never been one reported case of whales attacking humans in the wild			0
after watching the critically - acclaimed film , rock star @entity91 sent a cease and desist letter to @entity95 asking them to stop playing her song , @entity90 , as part of their @entity99 shows			0
then eight of the 10 acts scheduled to headline @entity1 's annual bands , @entity110 & bbq concert series - including @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104 - pulled out of the show citing the concerns raised by @entity4			1
@entity104 wrote on @entity111 to her fans : ' given all the issues that have been aired recently , the time is n't right for me to play at @entity1			0
' also this week , @entity116 in @entity117 , @entity118 , dropped a long - scheduled field trip to the park , according to @entity121			0
out : after watching @entity4 , rocker @entity91 wrote a letter to @entity1 asking them to remove her song , @entity90 , from their @entity126 water shows cancelled : country singer @entity104 is the latest of many high - profile artists to withdraw from the annual bands , @entity110 and @entity1 festival in light of the theme park 's negative criticisms for at least a decade the school has held an overnight excursion at @entity1 for fifth - graders , however principal @entity133 told @entity137 both parents and students had asked to go elsewhere this year			1
@entity1 president and chief executive officer @entity140 said in an interview thursday that the company decided to make statements regarding @entity4 only after losing their musical line - up			2
' that ended up getting more coverage and became a story of its own , and , accordingly , what we wanted to do is to make sure that some of the misconceptions that were floating around related to that coverage were put to bed , ' he told the @entity25			0
@entity1 would not say how much it spent on the newspaper ads , which could soon be followed by an online campaign			0
but the move suggests the company , whose 11 theme parks drew a combined 24.4 million visitors last year , is concerned about potential long - term brand damage from the small - budget film , which was just shortlisted for an @entity76			2
in its open letter , @entity1 says it has invested $ 70 million improving its killer - whale habitats in the past three years			2
swimming killer : @entity41 continues to perform at @entity1 , despite being responsible for the deaths of three people @entity1 's open letters ads , which appeared in newspaper around the country today , are on behalf of the marine park 's 1,500 employees , it says much of that has been spent on safety upgrades implemented after @entity51 's death , which remains the subject of a legal battle between @entity1 and the @entity182 @entity181			1
@entity1 says in its ad that the life spans of its killer whales are equivalent to those living in the wild , which contradicts claims by animal - rights groups			1
a widely cited 1995 study found that the mortality rate of killer whales in captivity was about two and half times that of killer whales in the wild			2
@entity4 claims whales in captivity live for about 25 years , while whales in the wild live to an age comparable to that of humans			0
@entity204 , @entity205 's vice president of veterinary services , said the rate of survival for @entity1 's whales is just as high as that of whales in the wild			1
regulations : following @entity51 's death , trainers were banned from going into the water with the performing animals and now have to be separated from the whales by glass			2
@entity1 is appealing the decision the @entity95 ad also says that it does not separate killer - whale calves from their mothers , aside from rare occasions when the mother can not care for the calf herself			2
but activists have compiled a long list of young killer whales separated from their mothers at @entity1 parks			1
the difference is one of definition : when @entity1 says ' calf , ' it is typically referring to whales still nursing , which can last until about two years of age			0
@entity236 of orcas known to be kept in captivity @entity238 of captive orcas owned by @entity1 , according to public @entity242 filings $ 538 @entity244 revenue reported by @entity1 in the third quarter of 2013 $ 9 @entity247 amount of money the @entity249 has spent on conservation , rescue and rehabilitation efforts over the past decade , according to its 2011 - 2012 annual report activists generally include juvenile and adolescent whales , which can be a decade or so older			1
' they 're just trying to take advantage of the difficulties in finding absolute numbers to compare , ' @entity256 , director of the @entity257 , an advocacy group in @entity258 and a researcher who participated in the making of @entity4 , told @entity264			0
despite its high - profile pr response , @entity140 insisted that @entity4 and the negative publicity it has spawned has not hurt @entity1 's business			1
the company says it is on track to post core earnings of almost $ 440 million on sales of nearly $ 1.5 billion , both of which would be company records			0
' as much data as we have and as much as we look , i ca n't connect anything really between the attention that the film has gotten and any effect on our business , ' he said			0
@entity4 grossed only about $ 2.1 million during limited theatrical , but has repeatedly aired on @entity137 and this week debuted on @entity286			0
a representative for @entity4 distributor @entity288 said thursday that the film 's performance on @entity292 's @entity291 and video - on - demand channels has been ' through the roof ' , though the company would not provide figures			2
@entity286 also would not disclose viewership data for the film			0
blackfish director @entity4 , who says she was n’t a marine mammal activist before making the film , calls the news encouraging			0
' if you tell people the truth , they ’ll change the way they do things , ' she said			0
' they ’ll make powerful and dignified decisions			0
' @entity4 writer - director @entity4 , who admits to not being a marine expert before making the film and rather just a worried @entity1 patron , says the backlash her movie has caused is ' encouraging '			1
