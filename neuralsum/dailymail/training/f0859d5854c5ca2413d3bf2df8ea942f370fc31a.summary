by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 he tried to enjoy it all , he really did			2
@entity4 was a picture of serene fulfilment as he raised the @entity7 alongside his jubilant @entity9 team - mates , but the personal acclaim still jarred			1
as the iconic @entity11 was buried under an avalanche of goodwill and adulation , he struggled - as ever - to cope with all the individual recognition			2
not only that , but the 34 - year - old could not just relax and savour his triumph because he had already started fretting over the next challenge			2
that will be the last challenge of his career - the @entity23 top 14 final in @entity24 on saturday			1
only once that is over can @entity4 finally try to turn off the tap of obsessive , competitive intensity			1
until then , tributes will just bounce off his protective super-hero ’s shield			2
hero : @entity4 lifted the trophy , but , as ever , praised the players around him for the success in the closing stages of this @entity38 showpiece , the @entity35 staged an epic love - in in @entity4 ’s name			1
banners around the stadium hailed ‘ sir @entity4 ’ and even nominated him as a potential president of @entity45			1
his last goal - kicks in this country , complete with familiar crouch and clasped hands , brought flashes from thousands of camera - phones			2
his words of praise for his team ’s collective effort after the final whistle were drowned out by chants of ‘ @entity4 ’			1
as ever , @entity4 found the hero - worship distinctly uncomfortable			1
scorer : the former @entity61 fly - half kicked 13 points as @entity9 comfortably saw off @entity63 ‘ i make no secret of the fact that i have been over-supported , ’ said @entity4			1
‘ i have been given way too much respect			2
i am a bit of a fraud in that respect			2
' i am lucky enough to be around great individuals and great teams			1
these are the guys who make the difference , yet it is not they who get cheered at the end like i did			0
‘ it has been amazing			0
there are too many people who have given too much to me in my life			0
if i thought about it , emotionally it would be too difficult to take			0
' just add to that list today , guys being so generous and kind to me			0
when guys go out of the way to cheer for you it ’s humbling			0
’ for @entity4 , the climax of this final soon gave way to thoughts about the next one - against @entity94 at the @entity45 five days from now			1
even during the lap of honour , @entity4 was wrestling with the nagging dread that another all - consuming ordeal lay ahead			1
after that , he must come to terms with an end to the draining weekly ritual			0
fraud : @entity4 claims he has always been over-supported and sees himself as a fraud having joked that the world of celebrity reality tv was not for him , @entity61 ’s @entity105 - winning fly - half said : ‘ i ’d like to take a little time out to realise where i am			1
maybe i ’ll have the opportunity just to relax a little and say , “ look , it ’s not do - or - die from now on ”			2
‘ i ’ve lived for 17 years where every weekend of your life hangs in the @entity113 might be nice that that ’s no longer the case			0
' maybe i can wake up on saturday mornings and not have that horrible feeling in your stomach and not have to worry about all the what - ifs			2
’ solid : @entity4 's brilliance throughout his career came not just from the tee , but also from his rock - solid tackling @entity4 gave the crowd what they craved with 13 points courtesy of two penalties , a drop goal and two touchline conversions , after tries by @entity133 and @entity134			1
in reality , those two , along with @entity135 , had a greater impact on the result than @entity4 did			1
saracens were pounded into submission and all attempts to match the brute force of their opponents foundered on the breakdown - spoiling work of @entity147			1
his man - of - the - match exploits once again revived the debate about @entity61 ’s policy to ignore him as an overseas exile			1
delight : @entity134 , who scored @entity9 's second try , was instrumental in their win @entity155 argued that his team - mate ’s continuing @entity157 omission was a major mistake : ‘ i think ( @entity61 coach ) @entity160 and the selectors are ruing their decision not to pick overseas - based players			1
he has really been phenomenal for us			0
‘ he gets vital turnovers			0
we also scored a try with his hands involved			0
people look at his body shape and his height and write him off at their own peril			0
he has been absolutely wonderful			0
' after the season he has had , @entity135 probably deserves to be playing international rugby			2
’ ' there were tributes , too , from @entity63			0
@entity177 said : ‘ he was an absolute menace			0
so many times we were on the front foot and he somehow got his good frame into a good shape to steal the ball			0
’ call - up : armitage powers through a tackle in a performance that @entity155 says should earn him an @entity61 call @entity189 added : ‘ he deserved to be man of the match			1
we could have done better to stop him but fair play to him			0
’ fair play to him , to @entity4 and to @entity9			1
what they did was not pretty but it was mighty effective in ensuring they retained their title			0
one more almighty effort and they can cap their playmaker ’s glittering career with a glorious @entity203			2
on the way : @entity133 scored the first try after a brilliant switch pass by @entity4 as for @entity63 , they will go to @entity208 for saturday ’s @entity210 final in ‘ wounded - beasts ’ mode to face a @entity213 team on a roll after their @entity216 success			1
they want something to show for an impressive campaign			0
‘ we will take a day or two to digest this defeat and hurt from it , then we will prepare to fight , ’ said @entity177			0
‘ we are desperate to finish the season with a trophy			0

@entity4 finishes his @entity228 career with win
fly - half claims he has been ' over-supported ' and praises ' great teams '
@entity155 says @entity9 *no.* 8 @entity135 should get @entity61 call
