even when @entity0 put what looks like a challenging score on the board they are still brushed aside with contemptuous ease			1
not for the first time in this @entity7 they seemed like boys in the men ’s world of modern one - day cricket			0
@entity12 , with the imperious @entity13 to the fore , cruised to their target of 310 here in such a ridiculously easy manner that @entity0 appeared just as far away from competing in this tournament as they did when they were thrashed by @entity20 and @entity21			1
it is frightening how far away @entity0 seem from the real challengers in this @entity7 , astonishing how far they have been left behind in 50 - over cricket since they should have won the @entity24 less than two years ago			1
the stark reality is that they need to beat @entity53 and @entity54 in their last two group games to advance to the last eight and while they should still do that it is fanciful to expect them to defeat anyone of note			1
@entity0 now need to win their next five games to lift the @entity7 when they have won just seven of their last 24 one - day internationals			2
even winning two on the bounce has proved beyond them in that time , let alone five			0
as ever it is the hope that gets you			0
when @entity0 had scored 309 for six they looked favourites at a @entity68 where @entity69 had destroyed them with swing when they were last here just nine days ago			1
but that was to overlook the sheer quality and experience of the @entity77 batting			0
they defeated @entity0 in all formats last summer and thrashed them in a one - day series before @entity80			2
here they confirmed their superiority with a masterful display of one - day batting to romp home with 16 balls and nine wickets to spare			0
@entity0 simply never looked like containing nor dismissing them			2
@entity0 , desperate not to be seen to be chopping and changing again , kept faith with @entity88 but he looked even more rusty and nervy than in his three previous failures and it was no surprise when he fell cheaply again			2
@entity0 are adamant that @entity88 , who averages over 50 in domestic one - day cricket , can be just as effective in the 50 - over game as he is in test cricket but the trouble is that he is trying to establish himself during a @entity7			2
@entity30 drops a catch on the boundary as @entity0 failed to build on their score in @entity99 @entity0 captain @entity27 was left with plenty to ponder after suffering his third defeat of the @entity7 @entity102 and team - mate @entity35 shake hands with @entity27 after @entity12 's nine - wicket wi it is another indictment of @entity0 ’s long - term one - day strategy that they threw @entity88 into this side on the eve of the @entity7 and it would appear they have no choice but to throw him out again			1
if @entity110 , who @entity0 seem so reluctant to pick , does not play next week against @entity53 in @entity111 then he really should despair about ever breaking into the 50 - over side			1
@entity0 made a great start , reaching 62 after nine overs , but they ran into trouble when they resorted to their old - fashioned habit of consolidating in the middle overs when they lost @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120 within 11 overs			1
it may seem harsh to criticise @entity0 when they have ended up scoring more than 300 but the one - day game has progressed so rapidly that you just can not afford to score at four an over for 10 overs as @entity0 did here			1
the pace was picked up by the impressive @entity128 , who has that knack of compiling run a ball hundreds in one - day cricket before stepping it up with the sort of improvised , expansive shots that have became simply integral			0
it was when @entity30 joined @entity128 , and then when @entity136 was finally let loose for the last four overs , that it was possible to see a future where @entity0 really could compete with the big boys			2
@entity128 , dropped on 17 at slip by @entity142 , was superb in reaching 121 off 108 balls , with two sixes , as @entity0 accelerated against some indisciplined bowling , 164 coming off the last 20 overs , 106 off the last 10			2
@entity128 was at least one bright spot for @entity0 as he hit 121 off 108 balls including two sixes @entity128 celebrates with his team - mate @entity30 after reaching a century against @entity12 the impressive @entity149 is the youngest @entity150 , at 24 , to score a @entity7 century and upon him rest so many hopes over the next 10 years in all forms of cricket			1
he will be captain in all three forms before too long			0
the hapless @entity157 disappeared for 25 off the 45th over and was then hit for another boundary when he had to complete an over for @entity160 when he was struck on the finger by @entity136			0
@entity136 was struck himself first ball when a nasty bouncer from @entity164 thudded into his helmet but he recovered his poise to hit a quite brilliant unbeaten 39 from 19 balls			0
one of the many things that @entity0 need to improve in one - day cricket is making sure @entity136 gets to the crease much earlier			0
when @entity171 was banished from the attack after bowling two high full tosses in the last over @entity12 speared to be wilting and they had been forced to use five bowlers to deliver the last 13 balls of the innings			0
@entity12 fans were in full voice as they watched their side ease to victory over @entity0 @entity27 talks to bowlers @entity29 and @entity28 as @entity0 struggled against @entity12 fat chance			1
@entity0 perhaps had their opportunity when @entity128 dropped @entity35 on three off @entity185 but from then on , with @entity0 failing to locate the swing that @entity69 gained here at the @entity68 to take seven @entity150 wickets , it was all one - day traffic			1
once @entity13 joined @entity35 the game was effectively over as the pair put on an unbeaten 210 after the loss of @entity192 and only faltered when @entity35 offered what looked like a simple chance on 98 but @entity118 did not even get a hand on it			1
it said everything about @entity0 ’s plight			0
when @entity13 , in his 401st one - day international , reached his 23rd century off just 70 balls @entity12 ’s triumph was almost complete and @entity0 ’s misery was acute			1
he really is a true great of the game and @entity208 ’s gain next summer will be @entity12 ’s loss			0
@entity0 now slope off to @entity111 and face a long week of soul - searching before they meet @entity53			2
there is much to contemplate			0
both in the immediate future and in the long - term in this form of the game .			0

@entity0 made 309 for 6 in their 50 overs which looked a good score
but @entity12 lost just one wicket as they won with something to spare
@entity35 and @entity13 both scored centuries
@entity0 must now beat @entity54 and @entity53 to progress
