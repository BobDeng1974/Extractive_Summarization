health secretary @entity0 has called for better online information for patients the health secretary has pledged to reduce pressure on doctors and nurses by getting people to diagnose themselves at home using their computers			1
@entity0 blamed the surge in patients going to @entity13 departments on the rise of a ‘ here and now society ’ created by 24/7 supermarkets and online banking , which means people want ailments treated immediately			1
he revealed plans for people to get an instant diagnosis for illnesses from a computer without the help of a doctor			2
but the online system could actually lead to increased pressure on hospitals if it replicates the round - the - clock 111 helpline , which has been blamed for wrongly sending people to seek urgent help			1
the current telephone helpline is manned by staff with six weeks ' training who read off a series of questions from a computer screen that generates medical advice based on their answers			0
flaws in the system mean the advice tends to be cautious and staff are often told to send patients to @entity13 or summon an ambulance for trivial complaints			2
mr @entity0 tonight said that expected people to be diagnosed online using algorithms without contacting a doctor or nurse within a couple of years			1
he told @entity55 that the long - term solution to problems at @entity13 was ‘ to make it easier for people to get medical advice fast because that ’s what they expect in our 24/7 society ’			1
‘ i actually think improving 111 is a very big part of that and i have to say there ’s one thing that i think is really missing from 111 now that i ’d like to see happen is an online version of it so you could actually go on to a website and not have to go through those questions with someone in a call centre but actually answer them online , ’ he said			1
‘ for example , i remember when one of my children had a rash , i think you would have been better able to get a very good diagnosis very quickly if you had a computer screen that said , “ which of these rashes does your child ’s rash most look like ? ” and that ’s something that is very difficult to do if you are talking to someone on the phone			0
‘ we have got plans to do it , we definitely want in the next couple of years to have an online version of 11 ’ ‘ in the end if we are going to crack this @entity13 issue , we have to find ways of helping people get medical advice that are easier than simply turning up at your local @entity13			1
’ mr @entity0 said the system would be mostly run without the need for a doctor or nurse on the other end			1
he said : ‘ if you look at the way online banking has worked , we are now able to bank 24/7			0
‘ the majority of the @entity109 population now do online banking and we can do that at 2 o’clock in the morning because we do n’t actually interact with any human beings , we ’re just using the computer programmes the banks have set up on their websites			0
‘ the more pressure we can take off the human beings who are manning the 111 service , whether it is the call centre handlers or the doctors or nurses , the more information we can provide to people electronically , the less pressure there will be on the health service			1
‘ i think what will happen , the algorithms would get you to a certain point where if it had n’t solved the problem they ’d say you need to speak to a doctor or nurse or whatever so it would be a combined approach			0
’ @entity138 hospitals are struggling to cope with a surge in people going to @entity13 , but the government has insisted there is no ' crisis ' mr @entity0 denied that there was a ‘ crisis ’ in the health service			1
he said : ‘ i do n’t use the word crisis because i think crisis is a situation where you do n’t have a solution and we have very good plans in place			0
’ he said one of the reasons for extra pressure had been because the health service had not been good at predicting change in ‘ consumer expectations ’			2
he said : ‘ younger people now , all of us , are part of a here and now society where when we have a problem with our healthcare , we want it sorted out in hours , we do n’t want to wait even a day to get it sorted out			0
‘ we can shop 24/7 , we can bank 24/7 , and the @entity138 has to change to respond to that			0
‘ essentially at the moment @entity13 is the quickest way to be seen by a doctor and we need to give people alternatives online to get that advice more quickly			1
’ last year , mr @entity0 admitted taking his children to @entity13 because he did not want to wait for a @entity176 appointment			1
speaking in the @entity177 , he said : ‘ i took my own children to an @entity13 department at the weekend precisely because i did not want to wait until later on to take them to see a gp			2
’ the @entity138 helpline has been dogged by problems since it was launched in spring 2013			0
whistleblowers have claimed the computer system that generates advice is so flawed it frequently prompts staff to summon ambulances for drunks or broken finger nails			0
some patients are thought to have waited as long as eight hours to speak to a nurse			0
the @entity138 website already includes an online symptom checker , although the new version is expected to be more advanced and more similar to the system used by the 111 helpline call handlers			2
a @entity197 spokesman said : ‘ this is yet more evidence that ministers have no plan to deal with the @entity202 @entity13 crisis			1
we always warned @entity204 that scrapping the reliable @entity206 - replacing nurses with call handlers - would pile pressure on @entity210 's a&es			0
‘ even now , ministers are complacent and putting patient safety at risk			0
they should adopt @entity197 's plan to help @entity209 , including more nurses handling 111 calls to give patients reassuring advice			2
‎ @entity219 of @entity220 said : ' the internet can be a great source of information but while progress has been made helping older people get online not there are still almost 5 million aged 65 and over have never used the internet			2
' if older people are feeling really unwell they need to be able to seek and receive help from a a professional			0

health secretary wants to improve online information for families
mr @entity0 says people should be able to check symptoms on trusted website
he hopes the new service will cut the number of people going to @entity13
the @entity202 minister blamed the 111 service for sending too many to hospital
@entity197 has blamed cuts to care in the *community* for surge in @entity13 visits
