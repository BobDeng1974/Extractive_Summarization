the demand by @entity18 , the information commissioner , means the @entity20 will be forced to release to him a pile of private correspondence relating to the £ 12 million government grant received by @entity24 last year			1
the @entity25 revealed in december that the charity received the money after one of mr @entity4 ’s aides lobbied for it			1
this meant the grant could be given direct – rather than having to compete with other charities			0
this newspaper then made a freedom of information request to the government for the release of emails sent between officials relating to the deal			0
but this was blocked by the @entity20 on the grounds that their publication would ‘ prejudice the effective conduct of public affairs ’			0
it is understood that the emails show senior civil servants expressed concern about the way the bidding process had apparently been manipulated to benefit @entity24 , which gives away books to promote reading among children			2
sources in mr @entity4 ’s @entity20 have claimed the aide , @entity56 , had referred in conversation to the fact @entity59 had hosted a lavish function for @entity24 weeks earlier			1
mrs @entity59 , who uses her professional name @entity59 , hosted the event in october at one of @entity65 ’s most grandiose venues , historic @entity66			0
at the charity ’s 20th anniversary party , @entity67 - born mrs @entity59 said she fell in love with @entity16 through reading @entity72 ’s stories and was keen to encourage her three sons to read			0
she quoted @entity76 ’s @entity75 song , from @entity77 , ‘ so please , oh please , we beg , we pray , go throw your tv set away , and in its place you can install , a lovely bookshelf on the wall			0
’ lavish reception : as a prominent supporter of the charity , @entity5 addressed @entity24 's 20th anniversary event in october now , after an appeal by @entity25 to mr @entity18 , a £ 140,000 - a-year former @entity91 employee who previously ran the @entity92 , the information commissioner said : ‘ i have written to the @entity20 and asked it to provide me with a copy of the [ requested information ] along with detailed submissions to support its position that this information is exempt from disclosure			1
’ mr @entity4 ’s office maintains that the decision on @entity24 ’s funding was taken ‘ in an entirely proper way by the secretary of state for education ’			1
there is no suggestion of any wrongdoing by @entity24 , which has given away 40 million books to schoolchildren in the past 20 years			2
it has received @entity36 grants since 2004 .			2

@entity24 received £ 12 million after *lobbying* from one of @entity4 's aides
@entity115 have demanded an *inquiry* into how the *payment* was secured
