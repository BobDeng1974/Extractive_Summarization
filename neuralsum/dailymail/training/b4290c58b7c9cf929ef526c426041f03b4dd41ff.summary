in his speech , @entity0 said @entity1 stays in @entity44 's imagination not because he was assassinated , but because he embodied the character of the people he led			2
he said @entity1 was defiant in the face of impossible odds and determined to make the world anew			0
' in his idealism - sober , squared jawed idealism - we are reminded that the power to change this country is ours , ' @entity0 said			2

sailing sometimes against the wind , sometimes with it			0
' the president and first lady @entity64 hosted the dinner in @entity78 on wednesday			1

they then stood together , with hands on hearts , as a bugler played the @entity44 military lament ' taps ' before observing a moment of silence			0
present , past , and future : presidents @entity0 and @entity82 were accompanied by their wives at the @entity1 gravesite , and @entity93 is thought to be the party 's presidential frontrunner big day : the memorial ceremony was held just over an hour after president @entity0 awarded president @entity82 the @entity13 - an honor first established by president @entity1 in 1963 support : @entity64 and @entity0 laid the wreath at the eternal flame that was established at president @entity1 's grave in @entity142 extended members of the @entity1 clan looked on at the tableau of presidential power , past , present , and possibly future			1

later today , @entity0 will pay tribute to @entity1 's legacy at a speech at the @entity10 in @entity78 honoring medal awardees			1
the @entity1 grave and eternal flame is in @entity142 outside @entity78 in a hillside with a paved area fashioned from @entity160 granite quarried from near @entity1 's ancestral home in @entity162			0
@entity1 clan : @entity165 's widow @entity164 ( center ) was on hand for the @entity78 memorial ceremony on wednesday at @entity142 , as well as @entity1 's grandson - @entity8 's son - @entity6 ( right ) holding hands : at the @entity13 ceremony wednesday morning , president @entity0 called @entity172 ' one of my favorite people ' and she was accompanied by both mr @entity0 and mr @entity82 as they headed to the grave surviving member : @entity172 is one of three spouses from the older generation of @entity1 relatives who is still alive , as her husband @entity183 ' @entity182 was killed in 1968 , just five years after @entity1 the @entity1 look : @entity6 is @entity8 's 20 - year - old son who is currently studying at @entity28 the eternal flame was lit by @entity1 's wife @entity186 during his funeral in 1963 and she was buried beside her husband after her own death in 1994			1
the poignant moment of remembrance came two days before the official half century anniversary of the death of @entity1 , who was gunned down in an open top limousine in @entity121 , @entity195 , in a crime which traumatized the world			0
the ceremonies have sparked a prolonged period of national and media reflection on the unfinished legacy of @entity1 , his tragedy - crossed family and of the evocative period in the early 1960s when his political star illuminated the world			0
@entity1 's closest living relative , his daughter @entity8 however , was not at wednesday 's ceremony			0
an early supporter of @entity0 's presidential ambitions , she has just set off on a new chapter of her life as the @entity44 ambassador to @entity214			2
@entity1 connection : @entity82 has often cited his meeting with president @entity1 in 1963 as one of the moments when he decided he wanted to become a politician wave of approval : @entity8 's endorsement of @entity0 over @entity93 in 2008 was deemed a turning point in the highly contentious @entity226 primary contest that year he was busy : former president @entity227 made an appearance on @entity230 's talk show in @entity231 tuesday night and did not attend the wreath - laying ceremony			1
former presidents @entity227 and @entity235 were also missing the joint @entity0 - @entity82 appearance at the grave site represented the latest show of unity between two political power families who waged a bitter 2008 @entity226 presidential nominating duel			2
@entity93 is now the favorite to land the @entity226 nomination for the 2016 election -- but has not said whether she will make another run for the @entity246			0
presidents @entity82 and @entity0 , both of whom were elected to second terms , laid claim to the legacy of @entity1 in their own @entity246 runs			2
next generation : president @entity0 held a newborn @entity1 under the watchful eye of the child 's mother @entity254 , whose mother @entity256 was one of @entity165 's 13 children relaxed moment : the ceremony was serious at the beginning but the attendees spent time chatting after the wreath was laid @entity82 was famously pictured meeting @entity1 at an event in the @entity265 in july 1963 , and has reminisced about how he set eyes on the presidency himself after shaking @entity1 's hand			2
@entity0 , who was two years old when the 35th @entity44 president was killed , accepted @entity1 's torch of @entity226 idealism in a key moment of the 2008 campaign -- which irked the @entity274 -- from president @entity1 's late brother , senator @entity275 , at @entity277 in @entity78			2
the two presidents stood together at a painful political moment for @entity0 after being brought low by the botched implementation of his signature health care law			0
in the @entity13 ceremony , @entity0 said that @entity82 's presidency proved that it was possible to grow the economy , cut the deficit and invest in science , technology and education -- remarks which mirrored his own core political argument to @entity44 voters			1
@entity1 's killing was blamed on a gunman , @entity293 , who the government concluded to be acting alone			0
but the 50 years since have been replete with conspiracy theories centering on whether @entity293 was the true culprit and if he was acting on his own initiative or was part of a wider plot			0
paying respects : though president @entity1 's family initially wanted him to be buried by the family plot in @entity162 , @entity301 insisted he be buried in @entity78 tributes : this week has been filled with ceremonies in honor of the 50th anniversary of @entity1 's death on november 22 , 1963 back to the district : @entity142 is just across the @entity310 , a short drive from the @entity246			0
