by @entity1 reporter published : 08:49 est , 25 october 2013 updated : 09:23 est , 25 october 2013 the parents of a five - year - old @entity4 boy have had to teach him to learn when he may be hurt because he can not feel pain			1
@entity6 was born with a congenital insensitivity to pain , which means he rarely feels anything even when he breaks a bone			1
' the toddler years were an absolute nightmare , ' @entity6 's mother , @entity11 , said			1
' he would just drop to the ground and smack his face on the table			1
he thought the fall was fun			1
' growing pains : @entity6 with his parents @entity11 and @entity20 , who had to teach him how to know he had been hurt like most toddlers @entity6 has had his fair share of cuts and scrapes			1
he has stuck his hand in hot coffee and on a hot stove , cut himself on a shard of glass and broken his pelvis - all without shedding a tear			1
because he ca n't feel when he is hurt , @entity6 's parents have to keep a constant watch on their active son , and try to teach him to understand when he may have injured himself			1
' we 're doing the best we can to just teach him ; he knows blood is bad , ' mrs @entity35 told @entity38			1
' we taught him even when he was little to say " ow "			1
' you do n't have to tell normal kids to say " ow "			2
' @entity6 's condition , @entity43 to pain with @entity44 , affects fewer than 100 people in the @entity46 as well as not feeling pain , the untreatable disorder makes @entity6 unable to sweat or feel extreme heat and cold			1
cautious : @entity6 plays on a trampoline with two of his brothers			2
his parents want him to have as normal a childhood as possible but have to keep a close watch on him keeping cool : in the summer @entity6 , who ca n't sweat , wears this specially made vest to control his temperature although his parents sought medical help , there is little doctors can do to treat the condition			1
when she first took her son to a specialist , mrs @entity35 was told to just watch him carefully and bring him in if he appears to be injured			1
the couple found more practical help through online support group @entity70 , where parents whose children have the same disorder shared their experiences			1
' we got a ton of ideas of people who have gone through it , ' mrs @entity35 said			2
' they have been a gift to us			2
' hope : dr @entity81 is trying to identify the gene mutation that causes the condition next month the family will attend @entity85 but @entity86 , set up by the family of 13 - year - old @entity88 who has the same disorder			2
the camp will give the @entity91 the chance to learn more about the condition and spend time with families in a similar situation			2
@entity85 is held in @entity97 in november so children with the condition can do the same fun activities others their age do over the summer			2
because the condition prevents sufferers from controlling their temperature , children with it often have to stay indoors when it is hot , or wear cooling vests when they go outside			2
dr @entity81 , of @entity110 's @entity109 , said because the disease is so rare it made sense that parents might turn to others in the same situation for advice			1
' there 's not guidelines , ' he said			0
' i think we doctors need to work with [ these patients ] and educate them and we need to learn more about this disorder			0
' for the @entity6 family , having a child with @entity43 to pain with @entity44 has been a learning curve			1
when @entity6 's father , @entity128 , accidentally stepped on his child , the five - year - old giggled because he thought it was funny			0
mr @entity6 had to explain that being stepped on was a bad thing , and that @entity6 should say ' @entity132 ' and tell an adult he was hurt			0
a few hours later , @entity6 yelled ' @entity132 ' as the family cat delicately stepped on him , believing it would hurt as much as being stepped on by an adult			0
a more serious injury however came when @entity6 fell from some playground equipment and broke his pelvis			0
he knew something was wrong but it took a couple of x-rays and scans to spot the break			0
' he does feel [ something ] , but the pain has to be 20 to 30 times greater to what we would feel , ' mrs @entity35 said			0
' he thought his ankle hurt			0
' play time : @entity6 is an active five - year - old who often has to have an x-ray when he takes a tumble her husband added : ' we consider him pretty normal			0
' ' other kids have had all their teeth removed because they would self - mutilate , bite their tongues , chew their fingers off , ' he told the @entity161			0
the family are currently working with researches at the @entity164 who are examining @entity6 's dna in the hope of uncovering the gene mutation that leads to the disorder			0
it could take up to eight years to find the mutation , and even when it has been found researchers still wo n't have a cure for @entity6			0
but , by finding the gene , doctors could find a way to simulate the mutation to ease suffering for patients with chronic pain			0
' we could fill our clinics five times over with patients in chronic pain , ' dr @entity81 said			0
help : the @entity91 have found support from families who are also caring for children who ca n't feel pain ' if researchers could disrupt a specific channel that only transfers pain messages it could possibly mean alleviating pain for those suffering debilitating and chronic conditions			0
' mrs @entity35 said the possibility that her son 's condition could be used to help others has been a silver lining for the family			1
' when he was diagnosed , [ doctors said ] there 's nothing we can do for @entity6 , not yet anyway , ' mrs @entity35 said ' but the fact that they can take his mutated gene and cause people with chronic pain to feel less pain			0
the thought of that is unreal			0
