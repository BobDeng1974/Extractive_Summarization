the mother of a dying four - year - old girl has spoken of her heartbreaking wish to give her daughter the gift money can not buy – a cuddle with her unborn baby sister			1
@entity7 , from @entity8 in @entity9 , dreams of being a big sister but was given less than a year to live in october 2013			1
now her mother , @entity11 , 33 , is hoping that little @entity7 , who was diagnosed with a brain tumour aged two , will live long enough to meet her new sister			1
tragic : @entity7 , four , is dying from a terminal brain tumour diagnosed when she was two excited : @entity7 is desperate to live long enough to meet her new baby sister , who is due in april @entity7 was having chemotherapy until last october but the treatment was stopped to enable her to enjoy what remained of her life - and what her parents thought would be her last @entity22			1
but , much to the surprise of doctors , @entity7 outlived the initial prediction of six to 12 months and is likely to celebrate this @entity22 as well			1
last year , @entity27 readers were among the well - wishers to rally round and raise funds to make @entity7 's dream trip to @entity31 come true			1
but this year there are no big presents on her list because all @entity7 wants for @entity22 is to be a big sister to the new baby , which is due in april			1
' i ’m sure some people will criticise me for falling pregnant while my daughter is dying but i can honestly say @entity7 has never been more excited or happy since i told her there was a new baby coming , ' explains miss @entity11			2
‘ i believe it ’s given her something to live for and i pray that they get to meet			0
the pregnancy has brought us all a lot of joy during this time and i have always tried to keep life as normal as possible for @entity7 and her sisters			0
involved : @entity7 's mother @entity53 says her daughter has been with her at every scan exhausting : @entity7 was given just one year to live in october 2013 too much : her parents agreed to stop her chemotherapy to make her final months easier to bear ' it 's heartbreaking to think they will not grow up together but i just pray they can at least meet			1
' sadly , @entity7 's tumour is thought to have grown since treatment was stopped , and her mother is expecting a scan later this month to confirm her grim prognosis			1
' there will never be good news because @entity7 is incurable , ' adds miss @entity11 , ' but all we can hope for is time as a family so @entity7 can enjoy being a big sister to the new baby			2
’ @entity7 's illness was diagnosed in november 2011 when she was just two after her mother noticed she was failing to meet milestones like her older sister @entity75 , now eight			1
she was already pregnant with her third child , @entity76 , now two , when a scan revealed @entity7 had a brain tumour and she underwent emergency surgery followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy			1
unfortunately the stress led to the breakdown of her relationship with the girls ’ father and they separated in 2012			0
then tragically last year they were told nothing more could be done to save @entity7 and the family set about making her wishes come true			2
thanks to an appeal on @entity27 , enough was raised to take the youngster and her sisters to @entity31			1
extraordinary : @entity7 , with sister @entity75 , eight , has outlived the original prediction of 12 months biggest wish : her mother @entity53 now hopes the little girl will live until april when her sister is born and more happiness followed when miss @entity11 found love for a second time , this time with a former school friend			1
' i asked him if he was totally mad when he told me he wanted to take me out , ' she says			0
' after all , as a single mother - of - three caring for my terminally ill daughter i ’m not exactly a great catch			0
’ but love blossomed and in february this year , she was shocked to discover that she was pregnant for the fourth time			2
' contraception failed and i questioned how i would cope looking after @entity7 and a new baby			0
’ weeks later she miscarried			0
' it was a lesson to me that any new life is a blessing no matter what the circumstances			0
’ the couple tried again and in august , miss @entity11 discovered that she was pregnant again , breaking the news to a delighted @entity7 at 12 weeks			2
all three accompanied their mother and her partner for the first scan to ‘ meet ’ the new baby and were also there for the 20 - week scan which revealed that another sister was on the way			2
close : isabella with her mother @entity53 and sisters @entity75 , eight , and @entity76 , two ' @entity7 was beaming from ear to ear , ' says miss @entity11			1
' she was delighted to hear she was going to have another sister			0
' but the truth is nobody knows if @entity7 will be here when the baby is born			0
all we can do is pray that she will be and until then i want her to be as involved as possible			0
' all she talks about is the baby			0
she is always rubbing my tummy and talking to her sister			0
the scans have been bittersweet because i do n’t know if they are the only time @entity7 will ever see her sister on the screen			2
' thanks to the generosity of people we have made all her wishes come true but this one is out of our hands			0
‘ it feels like a race against the clock but at the same time i do n’t want to wish this time away			0
we are fundraising to make magical memories as we always have been but @entity7 ’s dream is to hold her baby sister and i pray it comes true			2
