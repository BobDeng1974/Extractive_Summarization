@entity1 's son @entity0 has proven that the apple does not fall far from the tree in a new campaign for @entity5			1
in the black - and - white images , the 17 - year - old strikes a pose in the designer label 's suits and tailored menswear , cutting a dapper figure as he emulates his father 's smoldering stare			2
the handsome teen is not the only celebrity offspring to front the brand			1
@entity19 's son @entity18 , 19 , is also a star of the new campaign by creative director @entity21			1
according to @entity34 , he was discovered by mr @entity21 last summer in @entity35 , where he and his 13 - year - old brother @entity37 live with their parents			0
the film student and musician also has a half - brother , @entity42 , whose mother was @entity1 's late first wife @entity43			2
apart from his good looks , @entity0 has also evidently inherited his father 's ability to look great in a suit			0
offspring : considerably more freckly than his 61 - year - old famous father , @entity0 is a film student and musician who lives in @entity35 with his 13 - year - old brother @entity37 and their parents runs in the family : though his brown hair is longer than his father 's , they share the same high cheekbones , piercing stare and bone structure wild child : @entity0 displays his punk rock side in a leather jacket and skinny jeans from @entity5 's menswear collection in one image from the campaign , he looks coyly at the camera in a black suit jacket , black skinny tie and white shirt , his hands resting on his knees			1
in another , he displays his impossibly long legs - likely another gift from his 6ft 2in father - in an edgy black leather jacket and skinny jeans			0
though his brown hair is longer than his father 's , a photo of @entity1 from 1982 shows just how similar they are , with the same high cheekbones , piercing stare and bone structure			0
@entity32 , is that you ? apart from good looks , @entity0 also evidently inherited his father 's ability to look good in a suit same style : @entity1 is pictured in a scene from 1995 's @entity87 , wearing a very sharp tuxe on the horizon : while he has stayed mostly out of the limelight up until now , it seems big things are in store for @entity0 , especially after this high - profile campaign model in the making : @entity0 was discovered by @entity5 creative director @entity21 last summer in @entity35 while he has stayed mostly out of the limelight up until now , it seems big things are in store for @entity0 , especially after this high - profile campaign			1
it 's possible he may go into politics , judging by the internship he did last summer in @entity104 the teen spent the season interning in the office of @entity109 senator @entity108			2
happy couple : @entity1 pictured with his wife at an event in @entity113 in 2010 good - looking family : @entity0 's older half - brother @entity42 , 31 , ( left , in 2013 with his dad ) is also an actor			0
