this incredible image shows man - made clouds released into the sky by @entity5 rocket as part of an experiment to study the behaviour of wind in the ionosphere , 60 miles above the @entity11			1
the white ' tracer cloud ' , comprised of trimethyl aluminum , and the red cloud , comprised of lithium vapour , were dropped over the @entity16 in the @entity17 by a @entity18 sounding rocket and a @entity20 sounding rocket on tuesday at 3.39am local time			0
the mission , called @entity24 , for the @entity25 , allowed scientists on the ground from various locations in the @entity16 to observe the neutral winds in the ionosphere			1
@entity32 sky : red and white vapor clouds fill the skies over the @entity16 as part of @entity5 's @entity25 the ionosphere is a crucial layer of charged particles surrounding our planet			1
this layer serves as the medium through which high frequency radio waves – such as those sent down to the ground by global positioning system ( gps ) satellites or , indeed , any satellite communicating with @entity11 – travel			1
the ionosphere begins about 60 miles above the ground and is filled with electrons and ions			0
it will help scientists better understand and predict the electrical storms in @entity11 's upper atmosphere			1
these storms can interfere with satellite communication and global positioning signals			2
preliminary reports from @entity5 state that both rockets released their payloads , which were observed from various locations in the area , and all science instruments on the rockets worked as planned			2
such information could ultimately lead to the ability to accurately forecast this important aspect of space weather			0
the ionosphere is a layer of charged particles surrounding our planet			0
it serves as the medium through which high frequency radio waves , including those sent down to the ground by global positioning system satellites , travel			2
the ionosphere begins about 60 miles above the ground and is governed by @entity11 ’s magnetic field , high - altitude winds , and incoming material and energy from the sun. it can be calm in certain places or times of day , and quite turbulent at others			2
when high frequency radio waves , such as those used for the @entity99 ( gps ) travel through a disturbed layer of @entity11 's electrically charged atmosphere , the ionosphere , they can be disrupted			1
' this area of the ionosphere is known for calm days and tempestuous nights , times when the ionosphere becomes rippled like a funhouse mirror , disturbing radio signals , and introducing gps errors of a half mile or more , ' said @entity5			1
the two rockets will measure events in two separate regions of the ionosphere to see how they work together to drive the ionosphere from placid and smooth to violently disturbed			0
such information could ultimately lead to the ability to accurately forecast this important aspect of space weather			0
the @entity122 sounding rocket leaves the launch pad at @entity124 in the @entity16 ' we ’re looking at the two highest regions of the equatorial ionosphere , called the e- and f - regions , ' said @entity130 , the principal investigator for the mission at the @entity132 in @entity132			0
' violent ionospheric storms can occur in the equatorial f - region a few hours after sunset and if we can better understand what causes these storms , we ’ll be able to better mitigate their effects on communication and navigation systems			0

@entity5 's experiment will allow scientists to chart winds in the high atmosphere
winds can interfere with gps signals , introducing errors of up to half a mile
the rockets release clouds that can be tracked from the ground
it will allow a better understanding of why satellite signals are disrupted
