now this is unusual - a politician defending smoking			1
@entity2 senator @entity2 stood up in @entity3 today and thanked @entity5 smokers for contributing so much to the ' pile of money that other people then spend '			1
in a startling address - rubbished by doctors - mr @entity2 argued that smokers pay 17 times more money to the government each year than they cost the health system			1
mr @entity2 said politicians had ' an even filthier habit ' - spending people 's money on things ' that are often sillier than spending too much on cigarettes and booze '			1
puff : the senator came to the defence of smokers			2
deadly habit : as many as 15,000 @entity5 die from causes related to smoking every year			1
' ladies and gentleman , thank you for smoking ... ' he said			1
' your generosity to the nation 's treasury is truly staggering			1
' he continued : ' the government collects around $ 8 billion in tobacco excise each year			0
that 's a lot of cash			2
' ' last year , smokers imposed $ 318.4 million in net costs on @entity5 's healthcare system			1
depending on rainfall , smokers also cost the taxpayer about $ 150 million a year in bushfire control			2
' if you do even basic arithmetic , these figures disclose that you wonderful , generous smokers , pay 17 times as much as you cost '			1
he argued that the true intention of smoking taxes was for the government to raise money , not to help people improve their health			1
dr @entity66 , vice president of the @entity67 , told @entity68 the medical community was ' profoundly disappointed ' with the address			1
' i think it 's profoundly disappointing that an elected member of the federal parliament can make such ridiculous statements , ' dr @entity66 said			1
' this is a case of ideology before reality , ' he said			0
' the fact remains that smoking kills			2
it 's the biggest cause of preventable death amongst @entity5 '			1
he rubbished the senator 's claims , telling @entity68 that the cost of smoking on the health system far outweighs the money the government rakes in with the tobacco excise			1
according to health authorities , around 15,000 @entity5 die as a result of smoking each year			1
dr @entity66 , who said he sees the human impacts of smoking in his ward each day , said it would be profoundly beneficial to @entity5 's economy for smoking rates to continue to drop			1
senator @entity2 was elected to the @entity101 last year			1
his ascension drew fire from some critics who claimed many voters mistook his @entity106 for prime minister @entity108 's @entity107 on the ballot paper			2
@entity5 was the first nation in the world to introduce plain cigarette packaging in 2012			1
i 'd like to address my comments to the roughly 18 per cent of the @entity5 population that engages in a despised activity			1
ladies and gentlemen , thank - you for smoking			1
@entity5 smokers contribute significantly to the pile of money that – as i noted in this place recently – other people then spend			1
as you well know there are many such big spenders in this parliament , as are many of the people who malign you			2
they do n't like your habit , but in my view they have an even filthier habit : spending your money – and other people 's money – on things that are often even sillier than spending too much on cigarettes and booze			1
your generosity to the nation 's treasury is truly staggering			1
the government collects around 8 billion dollars in tobacco excise each year			0
that 's a lot of cash			2
last year , smokers imposed $ 318.4 million in net costs on @entity5 's healthcare system			1
depending on rainfall , smokers also cost the taxpayer about $ 150 million a year in bushfire control			2
if you do even basic arithmetic , these figures disclose that you wonderful , generous smokers pay 17 times as much as you cost			1
of course , i 'm aware that the justification for making you pay so much for your smoking is borne of a desire to help you quit and to improve your health			1
however , every now and again the mask slips			0
@entity108 – in one of those ' unguarded moments ' while in @entity169 – made the following comment in relation to the then @entity173 's tax hikes : ' it would only be raising $ 5 billion dollars or so if people are to continue to smoke , so let 's not listen to this palaver about health			1
this is all about revenue , it 's all about tax , it 's all about a government that ca n't control its spending – that 's why it hits you in the hip pocket			2
' those who would tell us how to live , back this flagrant theft , not because they 're prone to agree with @entity108 , but because they are troubled by the worrying thought that someone , somewhere , may be having a good time			0
those havers of good times , smokers of @entity5 , are you			1
this is why , having banished cigarette advertising from everything from television to cinema to motorsport and even the internet , and ended the commercial cultivation of tobacco in @entity5 , the health mandarins have moved on to banning smoking in prisons and insane asylums			1
that 's right , people in cages who have lost most or all of their rights are denied even this small thing			2
yes , prison is meant to be punishment			0
but the widespread tendency to see prisons as comfortable budget hotels bespeaks a fundamental failure to grasp just what gaol means			0
rehabilitation means not committing further crime , not being trained to live according to somebody else 's values			0
the same people worry and worry about @entity233 and @entity234 smoking rates , with about half of @entity5 's indigenous population being daily smokers			1
aborigines on income management , like prisoners , are also denied this small consolation			0
because the revenues versus costs figure is so lopsided , those who would tell you how to live have tried to add ' social costs ' to the healthcare costs i discussed earlier			0
' social costs ' take in things like smokers ' spending on tobacco , and the lost productivity represented by smokers ' earlier mortality			2
these , allegedly , represent income foregone			0
by that logic , deciding to work part time to increase your leisure time is a social cost , as is going on holiday			0
arguments like that suggest to me the anti-smoking lobby is running out of ideas			0
but when powerful , well - funded lobby groups run out of ideas and arguments , unfortunately they do n't fold up their lobbying tents and head home			0
they keep lobbying , and we 've now reached the point where , thanks to their efforts , the government is about to kill the goose that lays the golden egg , handing all the lovely tax money it extorts from you over to organised crime			0
@entity5 is set to have the most expensive ciggies in the world once @entity108 's extraordinary 12.5 per cent a year tobacco tax hikes – taken over from @entity290 – kick in			2
already , in 2012 , the @entity291 found that a pack of cigarettes cost @entity294 in @entity5			2
only @entity295 had higher prices , at @entity297			0
following the unprecedented 25 per cent tobacco excise increase in april 2010 , @entity299 's post implementation review observed that : ' the availability of illicit tobacco products ( products on which taxes have been avoided ) undermines the effectiveness of taxation in many countries in reducing affordability to prevent uptake and promote quitting , particularly among low income groups			0
' this should come as no surprise			0
here 's a little basic maths : if you spend $ 5,000 a year on tobacco , it 's a bigger proportion of your income if you earn $ 30,000 per annum than if you earn $ 100,000 per annum			0
in the trade , that 's what 's known as a ' regressive tax '			0
and if – along with @entity326 's mr @entity325 – we can agree that ' drugs are bad , mmmkay ' , it 's probably also fair to say that ' regressive taxes are bad , mmmkay			0
' calling regressive taxes ' sin taxes ' does n't hide the scale of the problem			0
smokers are typically poor , which makes this vast tax - take all the more perverse			2
it means , for example , that social planners who want to redistribute money from the rich to the poor need to increase both welfare payments and income tax rates to achieve their goals			0
when the 25 per cent excise increase was imposed , the @entity344 noticed an increase in seizures of illicit tobacco			0
in 2013 , it rose to 183 tonnes , representing forgone customs duties of $ 150 million			0
remember , that 's the annual cost of putting out bushfires due to cigarettes			2
and it 's also entirely to be expected : tobacco ca n't even be commercially grown in @entity5			2
smokers of @entity5 , despite your generosity , i need to apologise on behalf of the short - sighted pickers of your pockets in this place			1
maybe they have n't studied any history , because if they did , they would learn that the regime controlling cigarettes is no longer one of ' legalise , regulate , and tax			0
' instead , it now resembles two other regimes , regimes that were and are catastrophic failures			0
i 'm thinking here of @entity372 and the @entity373			0
in a world where cannabis is in the process of legalisation – because illegality simply does n't work – and where @entity372 enriched @entity379 but beggared the @entity173 , i think people like me need to do better by you , the smokers of @entity5			1
i am put in mind of a constituent 's comment , made to me last week			0
he pointed out that he valued the e-cigarettes now available because they meant he did n't smoke during the day , and also meant he did n't inflict his smoke or smell on others			0
however , he said he was still going to sit on his balcony of an evening , drink a glass of wine , and smoke a cigarette			0
he was going to continue to do this because he enjoys smoking			0
and that , mr president , is his choice .			0

' i think people like me need to do better by you , smokers of @entity5 '
