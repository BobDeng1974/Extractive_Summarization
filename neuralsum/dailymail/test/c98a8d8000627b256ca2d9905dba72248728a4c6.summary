@entity1 bomber @entity0 has been thrown another lifeline by two of his victims			2
@entity5 and @entity6 , who lost limbs in the 2013 marathon , today opposed the death penalty as a means of punishment for their attacker , urging others to ' overcome the impulse for vengeance			1
' the couple 's statement of compassion follows a similar appeal made by the family of an eight - year - old boy , @entity22 , who was killed in the blast			1
his seven - year - old sister , @entity24 , lost a leg			1
this week , after finding @entity27 guilty on all 30 counts related to the april 15 , 2013 , attack , a jury will decide whether to sentence @entity0 to death or life in prison without parole			1
' we must overcome the impulse for vengeance ' : married couple @entity5 and @entity6 have joined the appeals calling for @entity0 to be sentenced to life in prison rather than death emotional : the couple who lost a leg each in the blast said their position is highly emotional and practical moving on : here they are pictured completing the @entity1 in wheelchairs on the one - year anniversary in a statement to the @entity48 , @entity5 and @entity6 said : ' if there is anyone who deserves the ultimate punishment , it is the defendant			1
however , we must overcome the impulse for vengeance			0
' they call their position ' intensely emotional and profoundly practical			2
' the victims are n't the first to speak out against the death penalty in @entity0 's high - profile trial			1
the @entity48 editorial board issued similar sentiments and last week @entity62 senator @entity61 said @entity0 should ' die in prison '			0
like the @entity65 , @entity5 and @entity6 call for life in prison without parole or appeals to ensure @entity0 ' disappears from our collective consciousness as soon as possible			1
' the @entity65 made their appeal in a moving op - ed for the @entity48 , published last tuesday , just a day after the two - year anniversary of their son @entity76 's death			1
while the @entity79 say they are thankful to the government prosecutors for their ' tireless and committed ' work to bring justice , they are now asking them to drop the fight for execution and sign a plea deal to send the 21 - year - old to jail for the rest of his life			1
no to execution : the family of bombing victim @entity22 wrote an op - ed in the @entity48 , saying they oppose the death penalty for terrorist @entity95			1
the family is pictured on the two - year anniversary of the attack			2
clockwise from top left : @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103 moments before : @entity22 is seen circled in blue on the day of the @entity1			0
behind him walks @entity0 , carrying a backpack believed to have held one of the two bombs brothers : @entity0 's ( right ) defense attorneys have tried to paint him as secondary in a plot orchestrated by his extreme older brother @entity112 ( left )			0
@entity112 died a few days after the bombing in a shootout with police ' we know that the government has its reasons for seeking the death penalty , but the continued pursuit of that punishment could bring years of appeals and prolong reliving the most painful day of our lives , ' the @entity65 wrote			2
' we hope our two remaining children do not have to grow up with the lingering , painful reminder of what the defendant took from them , which years of appeals would undoubtedly bring			0
' they say sentencing @entity0 to death will only bring continued pain for themselves and the other hundreds of bombing victims			2
victim : @entity22 died at the finish line of the @entity1 on april 15 , 2013 ' as long as the defendant is in the spotlight , we have no choice but to live a story told on his terms , not ours			0
' the minute the defendant fades from our newspapers and tv screens is the minute we begin the process of rebuilding our lives and our family , ' they wrote			0
the @entity65 brought their three kids out to watch the @entity1 two years ago , and were standing just steps away from where @entity0 and his brother @entity112 ( who died in a shootout with police a few days later ) dropped off two pressure cooker bombs			0
@entity76 died in the blasts and his sister @entity24 lost a leg			1
during the course of @entity0 's trial , photos were shown in court of the moments before he dropped off a bomb in a backpack , strolling just behind the @entity149 lined up against a gate at the finish line			0
on the day the op - ed was published , the @entity149 revisited the finish line to take part in a memorial			0
the family were pictured hugging and crying at the emotional ceremony			0
the death penalty is outlawed in @entity62 , where the trial is taking place , but since @entity0 is being judged in federal court , execution is still a sentencing option			2
however , experts say that the jurors may sway towards life in prison , considering the state 's generally liberally view on the controversial issue			0
@entity0 's lead defense attorney is @entity188 , a woman who specializes in helping high - profile clients like the @entity190 escape the death penalty			1
@entity192 and the rest of @entity0 's legal team have been trying to paint their client as a gullible young man who was a secondary player in her older brother 's terrorist plot			0

@entity5 and @entity6 call their view ' emotional and practical '
their words come after similar statement from family of eight - year - old @entity212 , who was killed in the blast , and his sister @entity24 who lost a leg
jury will decide on tuesday whether @entity0 gets death penalty
two weeks ago he was found guilty on all 30 counts relating to the bombing
