for once , the focus of @entity1 did not fall on @entity2 on sunday			1
after the week they 've had , @entity3 was happy to shun the limelight this time			1
ask @entity7 fans prior to kick - off if they 'd rather three points or a @entity11 defeat in the @entity13 final and you 'd have been greeted with differing opinions			1
as it happened , they all got their wish			0
their arch - rivals lost to @entity20 at @entity21 and @entity2 got their win — by the same scoreline , — courtesy of goals from @entity26 and @entity27 , to move four points behind second - placed @entity29			1
@entity26 points to the sky after scoring the opener against @entity32 at the @entity33 on sunday @entity26 had a less than enjoyable time in his side 's @entity36 defeat against @entity38 on wednesday the @entity40 striker congratulates team - mate @entity27 after he doubled the @entity7 ' lead on sunday but much like their demoralising @entity36 loss to @entity38 on wednesday night , this did n't make for comfortable viewing			1
the 2 - 0 score does n't tell the full story			1
this was unconvincing from @entity2 ; the @entity33 a bag of nerves until @entity27 's last - minute goal			1
nevertheless , while their participation in this year 's @entity36 is under huge threat , their qualification for next year 's competition remains on course			0
despite their lack of fluency , @entity3 would have been pleased with the response shown by his wounded players following the midweek loss			1
@entity26 , barracked by his own supporters on wednesday , did not hide ; likewise @entity65 , who played on after breaking his nose			2
this was n't the @entity2 we 're accustomed to , but after the @entity38 monstrosity that did n't concern @entity3			1
' i think what was really important was the mentally united response , ' he said			0
@entity27 had been on the pitch for a matter of minutes when he doubled @entity2 's lead at the @entity33 @entity2 boss @entity3 said he was proud of his side 's response to the loss against @entity38 ' i am very proud of the response we have shown			1
our defensive concentration was at a much higher level than on wednesday			0
' we know with the ball we can do better but overall what was important for us was to respond with a win			0
not everyone can produce that after such a disappointment and it was vital for us to win			0
' @entity3 's comments , particularly regarding his side 's defensive stability , will have resonated with @entity94			1
the @entity40 rang the changes following wednesday 's loss			1
vice-captain @entity94 and @entity97 were axed and replaced by @entity98 and @entity99			0
for @entity98 , in particular , this was a huge opportunity			0
per @entity94 ( right ) was demoted to the bench following @entity2 's @entity36 loss to @entity38 @entity26 shows his strength in an impressive display to hold the challenge from @entity32 defender @entity106 @entity94 's role in the starting xi has been called into huge question this season following a string of below - par displays , including against @entity38			1
on reflection , it was n't the most convincing of performances from the 24 - year - old on his first @entity117 start since arriving for £ 13.5million from @entity118 in january			0
a clean sheet is a clean sheet , though			0
mertesacker knows that more than most			0
@entity98 very nearly gifted the visitors an early lead , failing to deal with a long - ball to allow @entity125 a free run at @entity126			0
thankfully for the @entity128 , his fellow @entity127 bailed him out with some fine goalkeeping			0
a goal would not have flattered @entity32 , who started brightly			2
@entity2 , though , were lethargic			2
@entity26 , unmarked from six yards , headed wide in the 28th minute after escaping the attentions of @entity106 inside the penalty area			2
it was the last thing the striker needed after his wasteful display on wednesday			2
but this time supporters did n't get on his back , responding to the miss by chanting his name			0
@entity2 's @entity98 ( right ) did not have the most convincing performance but managed to keep a clean sheet @entity65 was forced off after initially clashing heads with a team - mate before being hit in the face this certainly had the desired effect , as the @entity40 international nipped in front of @entity150 to flick home @entity153 's corner in the 39th minute			1
@entity154 tried , spectacularly , to put @entity32 level but his acrobatic bicycle kick flew over			2
@entity157 then saw a penalty appeal rejected by @entity159 , after claiming @entity99 had handled			0
much like the first half , @entity161 's side made a positive start after the break — @entity166 's dead - ball delivery causing @entity2 's defence problems			1
@entity169 , given his @entity11 connections , was afforded a horrendous welcome when introduced in the 62nd minute			0
there would have been greater boos three minutes later had @entity126 not tipped over @entity125 's first - time shot from a @entity175 cross			2
it was even more uncomfortable for @entity65 ( below ) , who was left with a broken nose following an accidental collision with @entity26			2
@entity166 attempts to drive down the win but his progress is stalled by @entity2 defender @entity182 @entity169 missed a glorious chance to ram @entity2 supporters ' insults down their throats , firing straight at @entity187 after great work from @entity189			2
the stadium was a bag of nerves by this point			0
@entity153 should have eased the tension in the 80th minute after being sent clean through on goal by @entity99 but the @entity197 's shot was blocked by @entity106 , before substitute @entity27 struck in the final minute to ensure @entity3 could finally relax .			1

@entity2 striker @entity26 scored the opener versus @entity32 on sunday
@entity40 responded well following his wasteful show against @entity38
@entity27 's finish helped the @entity7 to go on to beat the @entity32 2 - 0
