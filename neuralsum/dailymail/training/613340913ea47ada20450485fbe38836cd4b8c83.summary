by @entity0 published : 07:24 est , 28 february 2014 updated : 04:04 est , 4 march 2014 @entity2 , a two - time breast cancer survivor , has just been diagnosed with cancer for the third time in three years			1
the 35 - year - old - who inspired millions of women when she posed naked in @entity8 following her mastectomy - thought she was finally in the clear until she received the devastating news two weeks ago			1
' to go from believing that i was fighting fit and healthy to now realising that i am in a lot of trouble is a huge shock and something that i am struggling to come to terms with , ' she told @entity18			2
' it was like being hit by a train			0
it did n’t feel real			0
like most young women , i thought i was invincible , ' she said			2
she had a lumpectomy and eight cycles of gruelling chemotherapy			1
then , a week before her treatment was due to end , she found a second cancerous lump			1
she had a mastectomy , followed by five weeks of radiotherapy			1
the treatment was successful , however , she was rushed into hospital last monday with severe abdominal pain and remained in excruciating pain for the rest of the week			1
tests showed that she has advanced stage liver cancer and that it has spread to her lung			1
fight : after believing she was finally in the clear , @entity2 was rushed into hospital last week and discovered the cancer had n't gone away at all ' it turns out that the cancer spread in the first place but it was never picked up and it has been growing ever since			1
so while i have been working to inspire others , all the time the cancer was taking over my liver , ' she said			2
@entity2 started chemo on thursday and says she is ' up for the fight '			1
she has already changed to a plant - based diet , which provides an alkaline environment which some say helps in the fight against cancer			2
she said : ' i started chemo last week and my oncologist has told me that i do not have the luxury of time to explore other options , i must start immediately			1
' the cancer is inoperable as it has spread too far and radiotherapy is not an option			1
i have therefore begun exploring how i can heal naturally alongside the chemo			0
' one of the key factors in healing is diet			0
i need to get my body into an alkaline state as quickly as possible and the way to do this is a plant - based diet			0
support : @entity2 , who ploughed all of her resources into her business , is crowfunding to help her pay for her treatment ' i have read many stories of people who have survived cancer by switching to a plant - based diet and i have done this immediately			1
it is a big change and i have to completely re-learn how to provide my body with all of the nutrients it needs			0
' the other form of healing is emotional			0
this is also key as many serious illnesses can stem from toxic emotions that we have not been able to express			0
this is true for me			0
so i am on a journey of healing both naturally and with conventional medicine			0
' @entity2 has made the decision to try treatment in an @entity106 clinic where they use homeopathic remedies			1
however she does n’t have the funds necessary after pouring her savings into a fledgling company two years ago			0
' what i really need is financial support			2
i started my fledgling business 18 months ago and ploughed all of my resources into that			0
i now have nothing to help me through this , ' she said			0
documenting her journey : @entity2 has been photographed immediately post mastectomy , left , and coming to terms with it , right first fight : these images aim to capture the loneliness of cancer treatment , left , and being told the cancer had come back , right so in an unusual move , @entity2 is crowdfunding online to pay for her treatments			1
explaining her decision , she said : ' the biggest worry for me is financial security			2
after my second bout of cancer , i decided to leave my job and set up my business , @entity139 , a fee based financial planning business that specialises in working with divorced and divorcing women			1
' i ploughed all of my resources into getting the business set up and now find myself with no financial back up at all			2
' in order to give myself the best possible chance of healing and surviving this , i need to be able to pay for treatment , which is not available on the @entity151 as my options are so limited			1
i also need to be able to keep the roof over my head , which is the biggest fear			0
' in order to cover my basic needs and pay for the treatment that i need to survive , i have set up a crowd funding page on @entity158			1
touching : @entity2 can be seen being comforted by her mother as she comes to term with , what she describes as , ' losing a key part of her femininity ' ' i have already had an overwhelming response but am asking for people to donate something , no matter how large or small to help me recover			1
' any donations from companies for organic vegetables , or anything else that will help me with my plant - based diet are gratefully received			0
' if i do not survive this , or if i do and do not need all of the money , i will pay it forward by donating it to someone else who is in my position , or i will donate it to @entity179 as i am an ambassador for them			2
' fighting on : this image , titled ' looking grey and very ill and fed up of being pumped full of drugs ' , captures @entity2 during her chemo beauty : ' beauty beyond scars ' shows the scars of the first lot of operations			1
this image was used on a phd thesis on breast cancer , left , and , right , shows the scars of losing her breast @entity2 wants to raise £ 25,000 and it seems that her story has touched the nation - in just over a week she has raised more than £ 14,000			1
today , her funds stand at £ 16,000			0
keeping her supporters updated , she writes : ' thanks to your generosity , i have today been able to pay for my first round of functional testing and a block of appointments with my homeopathic doctor			2
' i have also been able to pay for a block of sessions to work on my emotional issues as well as pay for all of the nutrients and food that i require to start to repair my body			0
' all of this costs thousands of pounds and i just could not have done it without your help			0
thank you so much for helping me with this journey			0
' while she has never met them , an @entity106 financial expert has donated £ 120 with the message : ' after browsing your website it appears we have much in common			0
please stay strong ( both physically and mentally ) and please let me know if i can help in any way			0
' @entity2 , who is touched by the overwhelming support , added : ' i have to accept the fact that although i am incredibly strong - willed and positive and have everything to live for , i may not survive this			1
that 's a really difficult thing to sit with			0
' to donate to @entity2 , please visit her crowdfunding page ‘ let ’s kick this s * * ’ and keep up - to - date with her progress on her blog			1
