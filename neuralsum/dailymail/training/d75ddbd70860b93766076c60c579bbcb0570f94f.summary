pressure : former @entity2 human rights envoy @entity1 said she felt ' considerable revulsion ' more senior @entity2 figures came forward last night to heap pressure on @entity6 , demanding a judge - led inquiry into allegations that @entity10 was complicit in torture			1
mps and peers , including @entity15 ’s former envoy to @entity16 , insisted a formal probe led by a judge was needed to get to the truth and ensure public trust in its conclusions			1
the @entity2 leader continues to back a probe by @entity25 ’s @entity24 ( @entity24 ) , despite it having already cleared the security services of involvement in extraordinary rendition in an earlier probe which was condemned as a whitewash			0
on monday several mps insisted a judge - led investigation was the only way to clear up the questions posed by an explosive @entity39 @entity38 report into torture by the @entity41			1
the report was redacted to remove any mention of @entity43 , @entity44 or @entity45 , the @entity10 base used by at least two rendition flights			0
critics say the @entity24 does not have the power to uncover the extent of the involvement and knowledge of the security and intelligence agencies and what former @entity2 ministers including @entity15 , @entity56 and @entity57 knew			2
@entity1 , who was mr @entity15 ’s human rights envoy to @entity16 and now chairs the @entity60 on @entity61 , said she felt ‘ considerable revulsion ’ at the @entity38 report ’s conclusions			1
she said : ‘ i felt so angry and repelled			0
this has been rumbling on for some time and we are still none the wiser about @entity10 ’s alleged role			0
it seems to me the @entity24 does n’t have sufficient powers			2
‘ somebody in @entity10 read the report to get the redactions and we need to find out who that was			0
we need a judge - led inquiry to take evidence on oath and get to the bottom of what ’s happened			1
’ former labour minister @entity82 , who sat on the @entity84 when it investigated allegations of @entity10 complicity in torture in 2009 , said a judge - led inquiry was ‘ almost inevitable ’ , adding : ‘ the @entity24 is limited in what it can do , what documents it can see or who it can call to give evidence			1
a judge - led inquiry would be a better way of doing things and gain more public acceptance			1
questions : former @entity2 mps do not know what discussions @entity15 ( above ) had with the @entity39 during the height of the @entity39 ' activities at @entity104 , which were laid bare in a report last week ‘ on the human rights committee , we investigated this issue and we simply could not pin anything down and did not have the authority to demand answers			1
‘ in the end , the allegations of complicity in torture are so serious , so appalling , that an inquiry has to be seen to be done properly with no hint of a cover - up , and this can only be done by a judge			2
’ shadow attorney general @entity119 asked whether the @entity24 had the ‘ capacity and resources ’ to investigate , while @entity2 mp @entity122 said : ‘ there should be a judicial inquiry into this			2
it ’s something that i feel the whole country should be assured of and an inquiry is the only way to do that given the mistrust of all parliamentarians			0
’ @entity15 could refuse to give evidence to a judge - led inquiry into @entity10 complicity in torture			1
mr @entity15 , who was prime minister when the @entity10 territory of @entity45 was used for at least two rendition flights , has signalled he would be willing to appear before the @entity24 ( @entity24 )			0
but there are concerns that the @entity24 , which can allow witnesses to testify in secret , has insufficient powers to get to the truth			1
his spokesman declined to speculate on whether he would be prepared to face a grilling by a judge - led inquiry , raising the possibility that he would decline to testify in public unless compelled			1
mr @entity15 has been accused of trying to cover up the @entity10 ’s involvement in @entity41 wrongdoing			2
but a spokesman said : ‘ @entity15 has always been opposed to the use of torture , has always said so publicly and privately , and thinks it is totally unacceptable			0
’ @entity2 backbencher @entity158 said it was ‘ vital ’ the inquiry into what @entity10 knew about abuse of detainees was run by a judge			2
in 2010 , @entity165 ordered sir @entity166 to head the @entity167 to look into the claims that the intelligence services were complicit in torture			0
but it was suspended after two years while police investigated claims @entity44 was involved in the extraordinary rendition of two @entity175			0
politicians from all sides and human rights campaigners have insisted the @entity24 probe , which replaced @entity166 , is inadequate			1
but ministers say it should be allowed to complete the task			0
on sunday , shadow home secretary @entity183 said she doubted the @entity24 had the capacity and the scope to carry out an inquiry and her ‘ instinct ’ was that a judge - led process was needed			1
but she stopped short of backing a full judicial investigation			0
mr @entity6 ’s aides said on monday that the @entity2 leader agreed with miss @entity183 and had ‘ some concerns ’ about the @entity24 ‘ but we need to see the way the government sets that out ’			0
yesterday a @entity2 spokesman said the party ’s position had not changed , adding : ‘ as @entity183 said at the weekend , there continues to be a case for an independent inquiry			0

former human rights envoy @entity1 spoke of ' revulsion ' at @entity41 files
she said @entity208 intelligence committee has insufficient powers
