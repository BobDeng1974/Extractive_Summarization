it may appear to be a barren , hostile world today , but soon @entity2 could be host to blooming flowers and hanging fruit , if @entity6 has its way			1
the space agency is planning to send seeds on its next @entity2 rover , which is scheduled to launch in mid- 2020 and land on the red planet in 2021			1
the mission , known as the @entity13 ( @entity14 ) , aims to create a small @entity2 greenhouse which , if successful , could pave the way for humans living on the planet			1
@entity6 is planning to send seeds on its next @entity2 rover , which is scheduled to launch in mid- 2020 and land on the red planet in 2021			1
the mission , known as the @entity13 ( @entity14 ) , aims to create a small @entity2 greenhouse which , if successful , could pave the way for humans living on the planet at nearly £ 14,000 ( $ 23,000 ) to send a kilogram of food into space , cosmic cuisine does n’t come cheap			1
but @entity6 hopes that in the future it can grow vast quantities of its own food in space			2
as well as cutting costs , @entity6 is hoping a ' space farm ' will deliver a lasting supply of food for astronauts on deep space missions			2
it could also provide something called ‘ horticultural therapy ’ for astronauts to reduce stress , alleviate depression and improve their overall general health			0
the work is part of the @entity43 ( veggie ) to grow six romaine lettuce plants under pink led lamps			0
@entity6 claims that after extensive testing on plants on @entity48 , it does n’t expect zero - gravity conditions to affect the growth of the plants ‘ in order to do a long - term , sustainable base on @entity2 , you would want to be able to establish that plants can at least grow on @entity2 , ’ mpx deputy principal investigator @entity52 told the ‘ humans 2 @entity2 ’ conference in @entity54			1
‘ this would be the first step in that … we just send the seeds there and watch them grow			2
’ @entity14 would use a cubesat box – a case used for smaller and cheaper satellites — which would be attached to the outer body of the 2020 rover			0
this box would hold @entity48 air and about 200 seeds of @entity72 , a small flowering plant that is widely used as a model organism in plant biology			0
seeds would receive water when the rover touched down on the red planet , and would then be allowed to grow for two weeks or so			1
in around 15 days , the scientists expect to have a small greenhouse with signs of life @entity14 would use a @entity84 which would be attached to the outer body of the 2020 rover			1
this box would hold @entity48 air and about 200 seeds of @entity72 ( right ) , a small flowering plant that is widely used as a model organism in plant biology			0
the mission could lead to larger greenhouses on @entity2 ( left ) in the future the mpx is designed to be entirely self - contained to avoid any possibility that @entity48 life could escape and flourish on @entity2 , according to a report in @entity95			1
the seeds would receive water when the rover touched down on the red planet , and would then be allowed to grow for two weeks			1
in around 15 days , the scientists expect to have a small greenhouse with signs of life			1
the hope is the alien garden would allow researchers to see how @entity48 life can cope with the red planet ’s high radiation levels and low gravity			0
the hope is the alien garden would allow researchers to see how @entity48 life can cope with the red planet 's high radiation levels and low gravity compared to @entity48 , the environmental conditions on @entity2 are extreme with a non-breathable thin , low pressure carbon dioxide - rich atmosphere , extremely strong radiation from the sun. temperatures are on average -63 ° c and it has 38 per cent of the gravity that we have on the @entity48			2
with plans underway for a manned - mission to @entity2 , any possibility of humans growing their own food on this hostile planet would mean a smaller launch cost and a higher chance of survival			1
‘ we would go from this simple experiment to the greenhouses on @entity2 for a sustainable base , ’ ms @entity52 said			2
‘ that would be the goal			0
’ ‘ it also would be the first multicellular organism to grow , live and die on another planet			0
’ @entity142 bugs from @entity48 could soon hitch a ride into space , arrive on the red planet and trick scientists into thinking they are @entity147			0
this is according to @entity6 researcher , dr @entity149 , who has expressed serious concern that microbes may beat humans in the race to colonise @entity2			1
dr @entity149 highlights recent research that shows some bugs are more resilient than first thought and could use protective mechanisms to survive deep space flights			0
currently , spacecraft landing on @entity2 or other planets where life might exist must meet requirements for a maximum allowable level of microbial life			2
these acceptable levels were based on studies of how various life forms survive exposure to the challenges associated with space travel			0
‘ if you are able to reduce the numbers to acceptable levels , a proxy for cleanliness , the assumption is that the life forms will not survive under harsh space conditions , ’ dr @entity149 said			0
however , spores of @entity180 have shown high resistance to techniques used to clean spacecraft , such as ultraviolet radiation and peroxide treatment			0
when researchers exposed this hardy organism to a simulated @entity2 environment that kills standard spores in 30 seconds , it survived 30 minutes .			0

@entity6 has *announced* plans to send flower seeds on its next @entity2 rover
seeds will be contained in a greenhouse to avoid *contaminating* planet
in 15 days after landing on the *surface* , the plants are expected to thrive
if successful , mission could pave the way for humans colonising @entity2
