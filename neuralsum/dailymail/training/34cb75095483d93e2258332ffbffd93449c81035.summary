the body of an elderly woman who was mysteriously murdered along with her husband last year was weighed down with cement blocks before it was thrown into a @entity6 lake , it has emerged			1
@entity7 and @entity8 , who had been married 62 years , were both killed at their @entity10 home the weekend of may 2 , 2014 - but police still do not know who was responsible			1
neighbors , concerned they had not seen the couple , went to their home on may 6 and found mr @entity8 's decapitated body in their garage			1
his wife was nowhere to be seen			0
her body was eventually found on may 16 by fishermen at a lake , about five miles away by water from their waterfront home			1
killed : @entity7 and @entity8 were killed at their @entity10 , @entity6 home last may and their killer has still not been found			1
mr @entity8 was decapitated while mrs @entity32 's body was dumped in a lake police have long said they do not believe the killer or killers wanted mrs @entity32 's body to be found and , speaking to @entity38 , they said it is because her body had been weighed down by the blocks			1
she had two four - inch cap blocks on her body , but the killers must not have anticipated the effect of decomposing gases beneath the skin , which make a body more buoyant			1
police have tried to find where the blocks were bought but unfortunately they 're ' as common as ketchup , ' @entity49 sheriff @entity48 told @entity38			2
still , the body has given them potentially significant evidence that can be checked against a suspect when one is found			2
heartbreaking : the body of mrs @entity32 was weighed down with cement blocks before it was dumped ' ( there 's ) a lot more to work with when you have the body , ' said @entity65 special agent @entity64			1
' @entity66 feels that they need from the @entity65 , we will be there for them			0
' the case has baffled police , relatives and members of the quiet community			2
autopsies showed that the couple died of head wounds , but it is not known how they were attacked , by whom or why			0
mr @entity80 's head remains missing			0
no one reported hearing any commotion over the weekend they are believed to have died			0
nothing was taken from their $ 1 million home and their car keys and cellphones were left behind			0
video cameras at the guard house at the entrance to the subdivision were n't working , and it is possible the killer came by boat			0
the 19,000 - acre lake offered countless entry and escape routes			0
bizarre : nothing had been stolen from the couple 's $ 1 million waterfront home and no commotion was heard escape route : the killer or killers likely escaped on the water after the may 2014 attack while investigators scoured the @entity111 house and areas around it for evidence in the days after the grisly discovery , whatever they collected has yet to render a clue			1
@entity8 , 88 , had retired from corporate life - much of it with clockmaking companies - in the late 1980s to run a chain of @entity122 - area @entity121 's restaurants			2
about 15 years ago , he and his wife , @entity7 , 87 , moved to @entity10 to live out their years in the golf - course community in a waterfront home			0
the 3,200 - square - foot , $ 1 million home sits in a tree - shrouded @entity128 in the @entity131 subdivision , a dozen or so miles northeast of @entity132			0

@entity8 and @entity32 , who had been married 62 years , were *savagely* murdered at their @entity6 *lakefront* home last may
neighbors found mr @entity8 's decapitated body inside the garage and 10 days later , mrs @entity32 's body was found in the lake five miles away
*authorities* have revealed that her body was weighed down by cement blocks but she started *floating* as her body decomposed
police say it shows the killer or killers did not want her body to be found but wanted her husband 's to be discovered
police are still baffled by the case and have no suspects
