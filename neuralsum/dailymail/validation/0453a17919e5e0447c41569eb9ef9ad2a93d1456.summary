a man who walked off a @entity2 flight after he realised an asylum seeker was on board being deported is taking the airline to a tribunal because the airline banned him from flying after the incident			1
@entity9 , 51 , decided to leave the february 2 flight from @entity11 to @entity12 before the flight took off , after an asylum seeker advocate on the plane began protesting the deportation			1
mr @entity9 learned he was on the same flight as a 25 - year - old @entity19 asylum seeker , known as @entity20 , when he arrived at @entity21 to see advocates handing out flyers , and when the female protester refused to sit down as the plane prepared for take - off			1
' his female colleague decided she was not comfortable being on the plane and mr @entity9 stood by her and also decided not to fly			1
‘ we could n’t have been politer			0
we were travelling for business , we ’ve both got executive roles in the organisation we work for … we were not aggravating or inciting other people , ’ mr @entity9 told @entity34			2
‘ the protester was probably 20 seats behind us			0
’ mr @entity9 and his colleague pressed the assistance light above their seats and a @entity2 stewardess came over to speak with them			1
‘ my colleague courageously and in a polite gesture stood up and pressed the call button			0
when the @entity2 steward came over she indicated she was not comfortable with what was going on , ’ mr @entity9 explained			1
they were told to wait and eventually a federal police officer came aboard the aircraft			0
mr @entity9 ’s colleague told the stewardess she wanted to leave			1
‘ i stood up and said “ can you explain what ’s going on ? ” and they said the woman is protesting and we are going to have a discussion and i said “ look i think i ’ll get off too ” , ’ mr @entity9 said			2
when he and his colleague were back inside the airport the federal police took their details but no one from @entity2 informed them at that point of any kind of flight ban			2
it was n’t until mr @entity9 was returning from @entity12 four days later after catching a flight with a different airline that he attempted to return to @entity11 with @entity2 and was told he was subject to a no - fly ban			1
@entity9 was issued with this ' no fly notification ' after he walked off a flight from @entity11 to @entity12 which was carrying an asylum seeker thought to have been taken for deportation ‘ a manager came over and said “ you are involved in a security review and wo n’t be flying today ” , ’ mr @entity9 recalled			1
he was told to email @entity2 security to find out more but when he did that straight away he claims he did not hear anything back			0
after six hours he managed to catch a flight with a different airline			0
‘ i still did n't hear anything by monday and the only response i got was to submit a customer care complaint , ’ he added			0
after mr @entity9 submitted his complaint he then received a formal letter on february 16 informing him of his ban			2
‘ as a result of your actions on board @entity97 from @entity98 on 2nd february , we have decided to issue you a no fly notification - until further notice while the incident is investigated , ’ @entity2 wrote			2
‘ your actions are unacceptable and will not be tolerated by the @entity2 or the @entity102			0
‘ a @entity104 will make contact with you upon completion of the investigation to advise you of the outcome , ’ the airline said			0
mr @entity9 said he has not been able to find out what the review process entails or if @entity2 are going to refund the cost of his flights to his employer			1
mr @entity9 and his colleague have also been banned from flying with @entity102 and @entity2 affiliates flyers were handed out at @entity11 airport asking the public to save asylum seeker @entity20 from torture ‘ it ’s like a kafkaesque situation where you just find out the result at the end , ’ he said			1
the letter spells out how mr @entity9 can not ‘ travel on any flight operated by a member of the @entity2 or the @entity102 or travel on any codeshare flight operated by another airline ( including @entity133 ) that has a @entity2 or @entity102 flight number , such as “ @entity97 ” or “ @entity135 ” , on your ticket ’			1
mr @entity9 has complained to the @entity139 's human rights division that the ban discriminates against him on the basis of his political belief			2
his female colleague is also in the process of filing a complaint			0
‘ myself and my colleague did n't want to do anything , we thought @entity2 are a big company with a good reputation i ’ll find out the facts and it will all go away but it has n’t			0
‘ if alternatively there was no asylum seeker on the plane and i decided to accompany my colleague off the plane because she was ill i do n’t think i ’d be banned			2
‘ so the only reason i can see for this ban is my political beliefs … i ’m not a known activist , i never have been			0
i ’m in my fifties , i ’m not a radical			0
’ a @entity2 spokesperson told @entity34 there was a delay in issuing the no fly notification to mr @entity9 which is why he did not receive it prior to his next flight			1
' a number of passengers were identified as being involved in the on board incident , causing the flight to be delayed by almost an hour , ' @entity2 said			1
' a ‘ no fly notification ’ has been issued by @entity2 to those passengers while the incident is investigated by the @entity173			0
as the incident is under investigation , it is not appropriate to comment further			0
