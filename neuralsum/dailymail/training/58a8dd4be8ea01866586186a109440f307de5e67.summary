when president @entity1 flew to @entity2 to cast his vote early in @entity2 on thursday , he became one of over eight million @entity5 to have already made their decision for the november election			1
and now with the election just ten days away , early results from registered voters in those polls are giving both the president and @entity13 cause for encouragement - despite neither campaign having established a distinct advantage			1
president @entity1 appears to be matching his 2008 presidential victory totals across the country , but @entity13 is exceeding senator @entity20 's efforts and appears to be already ahead in key state @entity21			1
a map of state 's who have declared the results so far of early voting shows success in @entity21 for @entity13 but encouragement for @entity1 in @entity28 @entity5 president @entity1 waves as he walks to @entity31 for a trip to @entity33 , today while @entity13 gets out of his vehicle to board his campaign plane in @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 this morning early voters arrive and depart from a polling station in @entity41 , @entity42 this morning @entity5 @entity43 presidential candidate @entity13 reads a document while flying from @entity37 , @entity38 to @entity45 , @entity21 today ' i think the early vote tells us the same story that we 're seeing in the polls , which is that @entity1 's not going to win by the same margin he did in 2008 , ' said @entity52 , a professor at @entity53 who runs the @entity54			1
' we see it tightening			0
' while the most hotly contested battleground is @entity38 , unfortunately election officials do not break down early voters by party			2
however , both @entity59 and @entity43 in the state are exceptionally happy with the voter turnout , which has dramatically increased from 2008			2

' notwithstanding the voter suppression , we 're doing great , ' said @entity77 , chairman of the @entity59 in @entity74 , which includes @entity79 , which the @entity1 and @entity13 camps see as key to claiming victory on tuesday november 6th			1
' if you look at 2008 as a watershed year , ' he said , ' we are actually up			0
we have exceeded all of those numbers so far to date , which is really just remarkable			0
' but with the turnout higher , @entity43 believe that they will benefit from early voting this time around because of the higher profile campaign operated by @entity13			1
' president @entity1 outspent us in 2008 , ' said @entity90 , the @entity43 chairman of @entity91 , which includes @entity92			1
but now ' our effort has the resources to compete â€¦ this is a different race			0
' ' we think the early voting program is working in our favor , ' he said , calling @entity13 a strong candidate and ' a terrific and an organized @entity99 '			2
indeed , other 's believe that the early voting results point to a strong showing in the general election in november for a resurgent @entity13			1
' my belief is let the data do the talking , ' said @entity108 who served as national voter contact director for the @entity111 campaign in 2004			0
@entity108 , who is not working on the @entity43 campaign this year said , ' i think in most states that i 've looked at and analyzed , i 'd say that @entity13 is in a pretty good position , probably looks a lot closer to 2004 than 2008			1
' analysts point to the fact that @entity13 has mobilised a larger portion of the early vote than @entity20 and analysts have noted that @entity43 are making up a larger share of the early voters than in 2008			1
starting a two - day bus tour of @entity38 's small towns and cities , @entity43 vice presidential nominee @entity126 told voters saturday that president @entity1 has n't made the case he deserves a second term			1
@entity126 planned stops at a factory and a bakery , a couple of high schools and a dairy on his first day of this campaign swing through @entity38 , a state that has become the lynchpin of @entity43 @entity13 's presidential bid			1
@entity13 and @entity126 appeared together on friday night at a high school sports field , and @entity126 planned to be in the state alone until monday , trying to connect with working class voters the @entity43 needs if it is to deny @entity1 a second term on nov. 6			1
' we can not afford four more years like these last four years , ' @entity126 told 1,000 supporters who huddled on the cold factory floor of @entity146 in eastern @entity38			0
' and we do n't have to			0
' @entity126 set out on his 400 - mile tour of @entity38 under gray skies and rain , beginning a swing where he would lay the blame for the nation 's struggling economy solely at @entity1 's doorstep			2
while @entity38 has an unemployment rate lower than the national average , @entity126 has argued that the state 's relative fortunes are despite @entity1 , not because of him			2

@entity126 , a congressman from @entity175 and the top @entity43 budget writer in the @entity177 , said voters need to consider how they want to feel when they wake up the day after the election			2
' think about nov. 7			0
think about how you will feel the next morning when you wake up and turn on the tv , ' @entity126 said			0
' are we going to have four more years like the last four years ? are we going to wait four years before we have real change ? ' @entity43 presidential nominee @entity13 , vice-presidential nominee @entity126 ( left ) and his wife @entity184 ( centre ) wait as they are introduced at a campaign rally in @entity37 @entity187 , for sure , is ticking for @entity13 and @entity126			1
polls show the race close here and both campaigns ' internal polls show @entity13 's uptick slowing or stalled			2
the @entity43 ticket needs another boost if it is to overtake @entity1 , who has an advantage in the number of staffers in this state and his efforts to bank thousands of votes early			1
to that end , @entity126 is appealing in purely parochial terms , promising a revived economy if the @entity43 ticket prevails			0

' we were kind of a one - factory town			0
' early voters wait in line to vote in the presidential election on the first day of early voting at a polling station setup at the @entity238 today then , the @entity240 plant there closed and residents who counted on good - paying jobs to always be available had to take lower - paying jobs			0
he cited a friend who went from making $ 25 an hour with benefits to $ 9 an hour without			0
