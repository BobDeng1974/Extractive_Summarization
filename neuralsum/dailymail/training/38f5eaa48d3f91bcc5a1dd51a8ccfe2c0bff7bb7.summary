a training - ground injury to @entity3 ’s @entity2 defender @entity1 prompted manager @entity4 to bring @entity5 back into the team for the first time since the october draw with @entity9			1
in doing so , @entity10 flew in the face of one of his principles , that a player must train for two weeks before being considered for the first team			0
@entity5 actually only returned to training on thursday			1
@entity3 defender @entity5 ( right ) challenges @entity18 's @entity17 at @entity19 a reprieve for @entity21 @entity18 boss @entity22 spoke recently about how much his team needed @entity24 , while just this week the @entity25 was given the club ’s @entity26			1
all very strange given that the ex-arsenal and @entity30 defender was about to be sold to @entity32 team @entity31 for £ 1.5m last summer			0
ultimately , @entity24 rejected the move			0
@entity18 's @entity24 ( centre ) runs with the ball as @entity3 's @entity36 ( left ) chases @entity37 , @entity38 ? the differences between @entity3 manager @entity4 and his former @entity41 colleague @entity40 are well known			2
however , somebody should have told the current @entity44 manager that directors ’ box guests at @entity19 are entitled to a cup of tea and a sandwich at half - time			1
for some reason , the former @entity52 defender spent the whole of the break sitting on his own while everyone else went inside			0
@entity44 manager @entity40 watches the match from the stands at @entity19 on sunday former @entity3 boss @entity59 is trying to rebuild his reputation in @entity61 and got his first experience of the @entity64 derby on sunday night			2
his @entity70 side , playing their first game since a 4 - 0 defeat by @entity68 , earned a point with a 1 - 1 draw at home to @entity74			2
former @entity76 striker @entity75 put @entity70 in front with a header in the third minute but they were pegged back by @entity74 ’s @entity79			0
@entity70 manager @entity59 ( right ) watches his side take on @entity74 on sunday @entity22 no doubt sent on @entity81 at half - time with instructions to make an impact			1
his first three contributions were to fire a 30 - yard pass out of play , push @entity88 in the face and then fall over holding his knee			0
somehow , i doubt that was what @entity22 had in mind			0
@entity18 's @entity81 on the pitch during the 3 - 0 defeat by @entity3 at @entity19			1

@entity5 only returned to @entity3 training on thursday
@entity5 *replaced* @entity1 who suffered an injury on the training ground
@entity81 failed to make an impact after coming on at half time
@entity3 beat @entity18 3 - 0 at @entity19 on sunday
