by @entity0 when you go clothes shopping , what do you look for ? most of us , if we ’re honest , would say that an item ’s price trumps ethical concerns about where , how and by whom it was made			2
indeed , across the @entity14 , sales of ethical clothing have fallen thanks to their perceived high cost — @entity18 cotton sales fell from 18 million items to 12 million between 2009 and 2010			1
but ethics were thrust into the spotlight again last week when a customer found a ‘ hidden ’ message sewn into a £ 10 @entity25 dress by what appeared to be a factory worker , reading : ‘ forced to work exhausting hours ’			1
troubling : @entity28 , 25 , discovered the hand - stitched protest sewn in next to the washing instructions of a @entity25 sundress hidden message : the hand - stitched note reads ' forced to work exhausting hours ' @entity28 , 25 , discovered the hand - stitched protest sewn in next to the washing instructions of a floral sundress she bought in @entity37			1
@entity25 claims ignorance of how it got there , saying there have been ‘ no other incidents ’ , but it raises troubling questions			1
so , where can you buy clothes without abandoning your morals , harming the environment or paying a fortune ? while numerous small companies sell genuinely @entity18 and ethical fashion , such as fashion - conscience.com , ethicalsuperstore.com and stylewithheart.com , it is @entity14 stores that have the real power to make a change			1
no knowledge : @entity25 claims ignorance of how the got onto @entity28 's dress , saying there have been ' no other incidents ' you will find buzzwords such as ‘ sustainability ’ , ‘ fair practice ’ and ‘ ethical ’ scattered liberally across store websites			1
but finding out which companies live up to their promises is difficult , says @entity67 , managing director and founder of the @entity69 , the main industry organisation for sustainable fashion			0
‘ certain companies are getting pretty serious about the supply chain , ’ she says			0
‘ but every company tends to have its own standard			0
’ still , if you know where to look — and what to look for — there are places where you can buy clothes with a clear conscience			2
on the @entity14 : many of us do n't consider ethical concerns when shopping at chains such as @entity25 @entity14 giant @entity85 is one of the best , despite its cheap prices			1
its conscious collection offers affordable basics in eco-friendly fabrics , such as a shirt dress for £ 29.99 in @entity91 ( made of wood pulp ) , organic cotton - blend vests for £ 4.99 and jeans made from partly recycled material for £ 29.99			1
@entity85 regularly comes top of industry surveys on sustainability , and has pioneered the use of fabrics such as organic leather and recycled wool			1
it also features @entity104 labels , encouraging the customer to save energy by washing clothes at lower temperatures , and offers to recycle old clothes			0
online giant @entity110 is another pioneer with @entity112 , an ethical line made in @entity114 which uses local fabrics : this season ’s standouts include a £ 35 mesh maxi - dress and a beautiful £ 12 zebra - print scarf			1
@entity120 is another good bet , as it has signed up to the @entity123			0
the campaign group @entity124 ( @entity125 ) also found in a report that @entity120 was in the process of raising workers ’ wages to meet a ‘ living wage ’ benchmark			2
@entity125 spokeswoman @entity132 says : ‘ most people making our clothes have to choose between buying shoes for their children and having dinner			0
doubling the wage of workers who make a t - shirt can cost as little as 20p per shirt — but most brands are n’t prepared to forgo even a fraction of their enormous profits			1
’ the report gives a very low ethical rating to brands including @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 and @entity152 , based on lack of transparency and the number of subcontractors and indirect employees , who may not have as many workers ’ rights			0
@entity160 is another winner , though			0
it aims for workers in @entity164 , @entity165 and @entity166 to be paid a living wage by 2015 , and has strict animal welfare rules in its tanneries , refusing to sell wool from sheep that have been mulesed ( a technique to prevent maggot infestation by cutting away skin near the tail , often without anaesthetic )			0
it uses organic and @entity18 cotton and wool in many items , from £ 5 vests to wool men ’s suits at £ 349			2
@entity184 hit : dress by @entity85 and its @entity160 initiative with @entity187 aims to reduce the number of clothes going to landfill — a billion items a year in the @entity192			1
while some stores quietly offer small lines of organic or @entity18 t - shirts — including @entity196 , from about £ 20 , and @entity198 , which has organic cotton childrenswear — it is at department stores that you may be most able to make informed choices			2
@entity203 is aiming to increase its @entity192 suppliers by 15 per cent next year and stocks brands such as @entity207 , a @entity209 company that specialises in @entity211 - certified organic cotton , with @entity213 - worthy @entity212 tops for £ 29.95			2
@entity222 , meanwhile , stocks @entity215 , the @entity18 fashion pioneer beloved by @entity217 and @entity218 , which has dresses from about £ 45 , with @entity221 - designed frocks from £ 75			0
even without the labels of ‘ organic ’ and @entity18 , you can buy more responsibly on the @entity14			1
take jeans : producing a single pair uses 11,000 litres of water during manufacture , according to the @entity228 , polluting rivers in countries such as @entity231 with mercury , cadmium and lead			0
that makes @entity236 ’s a good buy : they have signed up to the @entity239 and come up with a technique for washing denim in recycled water			0
buying ethical does mean savvy shopping and sometimes paying a little more			0
but surely it ’s worth it — after all , for every bargain basement dress someone , somewhere , might be paying a heavy price .			0
