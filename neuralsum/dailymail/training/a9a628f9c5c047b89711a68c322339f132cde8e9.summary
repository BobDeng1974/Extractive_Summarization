those of us caught in downpours in our shorts or left peeling soggy sausages off the barbecue could probably have told them all along			0
the @entity7 finally admitted yesterday that the forecasts it gave of ‘ dry ’ weather last year were ‘ not helpful ’			2
but the organisation ’s chief scientist still insisted two - thirds of its long - term forecasts are ‘ very helpful ’ – without specifying quite what that means for the other third			1
error : the @entity7 predicted that last april would be a dry month			2
but a later report sent to @entity18 said the advice was ' not helpful ' as the month was ' the wettest since detailed records began ' in its official guidance to the @entity18 , the @entity7 said that last april was likely to be ‘ drier than usual ’			1
instead , of course , it turned into a washout that spilled over into the rest of 2012 – which became the wettest year since records began			1
so while the long - term forecast suggested a national drought that was going to get worse , tens of thousands actually found themselves facing widespread flooding			1
the embarrassing admission came to light thanks to a @entity34 request			0
an internal document revealed that forecasters had said at the end of march that they expected ‘ drier than average conditions for april to june , with april driest ’			2
but in a report sent later to @entity18 ’s chief scientist , the @entity7 admitted : ‘ given that april was the wettest since detailed records began in 1910 , and the april may june quarter was also the wettest , this advice was not helpful			1
’ the @entity7 has been so embarrassed by its errors in the past that it stopped issuing long - term forecasts to the public			1
instead , it continues to give ‘ probability ’ guidance for coming months to @entity51 departments such as @entity18 which need to plan			1
but last year , it seems , its forecast did nothing to help anyone			0
yesterday , @entity7 chief scientist @entity55 insisted that in almost two - thirds of cases their long term ‘ probabilistic ’ predictions were ‘ very helpful ’			1
she said of last year ’s forecast : ‘ in march we were facing really very serious pressures on water resources – a major drought that had been going on for a couple of years			0
i thought i was right to emphasise the risk of dry conditions continuing as a precautionary principle			0
’ washout : @entity70 in @entity71 , the home of @entity73 , after the record rainfall no more predictions : the @entity7 has been so embarrassed by its errors in the past that it stopped issuing long - term forecasts to the public still , professor @entity80 was not deterred from making a few predictions for those shivering their way through the @entity85 weekend			1
she suggested better weather would arrive – but not until may			0
she said : ‘ we certainly see the cold weather continuing at least for the next few days , and potentially into the middle of april			0
our monthly forecast looking at april slightly favours cold conditions continuing			0
‘ beyond that , i think , into the summer , it ’s much more difficult to predict			0
i think we ’re expecting a return to normal conditions into may and then june			0
’ in the short - term , forecasters say most parts of the country can expect dry and bright spells until tuesday , although temperatures will remain very low .			2

@entity7 said that last april was likely to be ' drier than usual '
but it turned out to the wettest since detailed records began in 1910
so embarrassed by long - term forecasts it has stopped issuing them
it now gives ‘ probability ’ guidance to @entity51 departments
