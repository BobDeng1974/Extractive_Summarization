while we share 99 per cent of our genes with chimpanzees , our brains are still three times as big			0
scientists believe that during evolution our genome must have changed in order to trigger such a massive brain growth			2
now , for the first time , researchers in @entity11 have identified a gene that is only present in humans , making our minds far more complex than other species			2
scientists in @entity18 have found a single single gene that may be responsible for the large number of neurons found uniquely in the human brain			1
when this gene was inserted in the brain of a mouse embryo ( pictured ) , it caused the formation of many more neurons ( stained red ) scientists believe the gene arose in humans after our ancient ancestors and those of chimps split from the same evolutionary path more than five million years ago			1
known as @entity38 , the gene contributes to the reproduction of basal brain stem cells , triggering an increase in the number of neurons in the neocortex			1
this is a brain region that is central to reasoning , language and sensory perception			1
the researchers at the @entity51 isolated different subpopulations of human brain stem cells and identified , which genes are active in which cell type			0
scientists believe the gene arose on the humans after our ancient ancestors and those of chimps split from the same evolutionary path more than five million years @entity64 as @entity38 , the gene contributes to the reproduction of basal brain stem cells , triggering an increase in the number of neurons in the neocortex			1
they noticed the gene @entity38 , which is also found in our closest relatives , the @entity71 and @entity72 , but not in chimpanzees			2
around 3.8 million ago , our ancestors @entity75 , had a brain that was 30 cubic inches ( 500 cubic centimeters ) in volume			1
about 1.8 million years ago , @entity78 had a brain twice the size of @entity75			1
when @entity71 and @entity82 arrived , the brain had grown to 85 cubic inches ( 1.4 litres ) in volume			0
despite this increase in size , scientists believe human 's intelligence may have more to do with how brain cells form that how large the brain grows			2
tests on mouse embryos revealed that the gene can have a huge impact on brain development			0
embryos injected with the gene grew larger brain regions and some developed the wrinkled surface characteristic of the human brain , allowing more tissue to fit into the skull			0
' it is so cool that one tiny gene alone may suffice to affect the phenotype of the stem cells , which contributed the most to the expansion of the neocortex , ' study lead author @entity103 at the @entity104 and @entity105 told @entity112			0
but it is likely this gene is just one of a large number of genetic changes that make human intelligence unique , she added			0
around 3.8 million ago , our ancestors @entity75 , had a brain that was less than 30 cubic inches ( 500 cubic centimeters ) in volume			1
about 1.8 million years ago , @entity78 had a brain twice the size of @entity75			1
when @entity71 and @entity82 arrived , the brain had grown to 85 cubic inches ( 1.4 litres ) in volume			0
despite this increase in size , scientists believe human 's intelligence may have more to do with how brain cells form that how large the brain grows			0
the team now wants the mice to grow into adults while carrying the gene to see if it improves their intelligence .			0

the @entity38 gene increases the number of neurons in neocortex
this is a brain region that is key to reasoning , language and perception
scientists believe the gene arose in humans after our ancient ancestors and those of chimps split more than five million years ago
