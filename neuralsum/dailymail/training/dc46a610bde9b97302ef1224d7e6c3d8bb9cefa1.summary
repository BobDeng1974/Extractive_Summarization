a report on sunday in the daily @entity8 quotes the deputy head of @entity1 's space agency , @entity11 , as saying the planned launch is part of the country 's plans to send a human to space in 2018			1
mr @entity11 added that animals with a similar weight as monkeys are under consideration as future space test subjects			2
earlier this year , @entity1 said it launched a monkey out of the @entity30 's atmosphere six national space programs have so far flown animals into space : the @entity34 , the @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity1			1
they were used as surrogates to test the suitability of the space environment for human habitation			0
fruit flies were the first animals to be sent into orbit when they were put on board a @entity35 - launched v - 2 rocket on february 20 , 1947			2
two years later , @entity49 , a @entity50 , became the first monkey to go into space			0
in november 1957 @entity53 sent @entity54 the dog into orbit aboard the @entity34 @entity58 spacecraft			0
then , on january 31 , 1961 , @entity59 became the first chimpanzee launched into outer space as part of the @entity64 space programme			0

one of over a dozen chimpanzees trained by the @entity35 to beat the @entity34 ’s attempt to win the space race , @entity59 made history as the @entity102 extended into orbit			1
as the @entity53 moved closer to sending a human into space , the @entity35 decided to use three - year - old @entity59 — in a style reminiscent of a gas - detecting canary in a mine — to find out whether humans would be able to survive in such conditions			2
in september , @entity1 suggested it may also launch @entity88 cats into space			1
