president @entity0 will sign legislation imposing new economic sanctions on @entity3 , as the @entity4 claims some credit for sparking @entity7 's roiling currency crisis and moves to deepen the pain			1
the @entity3 economy has been in a downward spiral for months , but president @entity11 has managed to maintain political support at home			2
however , @entity15 officials acknowledged there were no guarantees @entity3 's economic woes and another round of sanctions would compel @entity11 to curtail aggressive actions in @entity22			1
it comes as @entity25 chancellor @entity24 pursues a policy of engagement and has spoken with @entity11 how he could go about imposing a comprehensive ceasefire in war torn @entity22			0
following president @entity0 's ( pictured ) decision to sign - off the bill , a @entity15 spokesman said it was hoped the latest round of sanctions would ' sharpen the choices ' @entity11 faces in @entity22 ' the aim is to sharpen the choice he faces , ' @entity15 spokesman @entity37 said of the sanctions			1
he said @entity0 was likely to sign the bill this week after the measure cleared @entity43 late saturday			1
@entity0 's support came as the @entity3 ruble continued its precipitous fall			1
the impact of the @entity49 sanctions has been compounded by plummeting oil prices , leading @entity3 's @entity51 to announce a massive middle - of - the - night interest rate increase tuesday in an unsuccessful bid to stabilize the currency			1
@entity0 economic adviser @entity55 said @entity3 was grappling with a crisis of its own making			1
' the combination of our sanctions , the uncertainty they 've created for themselves with their international actions and the falling price of oil has put their economy on the brink of crisis , ' mr @entity55 said			2
' that gives you only bad choices			0
' mr @entity37 said the president had concerns about the measure but felt it gave him ' flexibility ' in carrying out lawmakers ' stipulations			0
the legislation includes a waiver allowing @entity0 to forgo the penalties if doing so was in @entity4 national security interests			2
administration officials would n't say whether @entity0 planned to exercise the waiver			0
the legislation has widespread bipartisan support on @entity88 but has worried @entity89 , where leaders fear unilateral @entity4 action will undermine the @entity93 's united front against @entity7			2
president @entity0 will sign the legislation following its approval in @entity43 on saturday			1
file image used for months , the @entity4 and @entity98 have sought to enact sanctions against @entity3 in tandem			2
but @entity89 , which has a far more extensive economic relationship with @entity3 than does the @entity4 , has largely reached its limit for enacting broad sanctions against the @entity3 energy industry and other key economic sectors unless the @entity106 ramps up its actions in @entity22			1
however , in an apparent attempt to maintain some @entity49 unity as @entity0 signs the legislation , a @entity49 diplomat said the @entity4 and @entity98 were preparing similar packages of trade and investment bans in @entity115 , the strategically important peninsula @entity3 annexed from @entity22 earlier this year			1
those penalties could be announced in the coming days , according to the diplomat , who was not authorized to discuss the pending action publicly and insisted on anonymity			0
following the takeover of @entity115 , @entity106 - backed rebels began occupying cities in eastern @entity22 , near @entity3 's border			0
the @entity93 has accused @entity3 of supplying and supporting the rebels			0
@entity22 officials have been pressing the @entity4 to supply its military with weapons and ammunition to fight the @entity3 - backed forces			0
@entity0 has resisted those requests because he fears lethal assistance would antagonize @entity3 and perhaps spur @entity7 to launch a full - scale invasion			1
the legislation gives the president the authority to send @entity22 anti-tank weapons , counter-artillery radar and tactical surveillance drones			0
administration officials said @entity0 was not expected to act on that authority			0
@entity25 chancellor @entity24 ( left ) has called @entity11 ( right ) to discuss steps for a ceasefire in @entity22 the bill does require the president to impose penalties on state - owned arms dealer @entity144 and other @entity3 defense companies tied to unrest in @entity22 , @entity148 , @entity149 and @entity150 , unless the president invokes his waiver authority			2
the sanctions would be extended to people and entities helping the companies			0
meanwhile , @entity25 chancellor @entity24 has called @entity11 to discuss possible steps to secure a comprehensive cease - fire in eastern @entity22			0
the call late tuesday came as @entity3 grappled with a sudden drop in its currency , the ruble			1
@entity7 has accused the @entity93 of trying to inflict economic pain on @entity3 for political ends			1
@entity24 's office said wednesday that the two leaders were joined by @entity168 president @entity167 and @entity22 president @entity169 in the discussion			0
it said they agreed on the need for increased humanitarian aid , including by @entity22 , to separatist - controlled parts of the east .			0
