by @entity0 published : 16:10 est , 10 december 2012 updated : 16:10 est , 10 december 2012 social services and mental health workers made ' serious and cumulative failings ' that contributed to the deaths of two children who were killed by their mentally - ill mother , a coroner ruled today			1
paranoid schizophrenic @entity8 killed ten - year - old @entity9 and his sister @entity10 , three , when the children were allowed to stay with her unsupervised overnight in january 2007			1
she was allowed to have the children without supervision on three separate visits and on the third bludgeoned @entity9 to death with a hammer and suffocated @entity10 with cling film at her flat in @entity21 , @entity22 , east @entity23			1
tragic : ten - year - old @entity24 ( left ) and his sister @entity25 , three , were killed by their mother during an unsupervised visit assistant deputy coroner for @entity30 said today their mother probably would not have been given unsupervised access if the risks to the children had been ' properly recognised and managed '			1
the inquest heard social services told the children 's father @entity37 there was nothing he could do to stop @entity8 seeing them			1
this was despite her having been sectioned under the @entity44 in the past for threatening a relative with a knife and believing her children had been swapped at birth			0
she also had not had contact with the pair for several months before she asked to see them			0
loving father mr @entity9 told the inquest at @entity55 last month he was told he could not stop contact between the children and @entity8 , who had parental responsibility			1
he said he had told social worker @entity59 that his former partner had requested overnight contact with the children after one brief supervised day visit and was not comfortable with increased access			2
he said : ' @entity59 told me that there is nothing to stop her from seeing the children as i do n't have parental responsibility			2
i did n't have a leg to stand on			0
' he said he was getting advice from lawyers about seeking parental responsibility at the time but allowed two overnight visits which seemed to have gone well			0
however , @entity8 killed the children on the third			2
the court heard that the couple 's relationship deteriorated around 2002 and two years later she started denying the two children were hers			0
by january 2006 , mr @entity9 was in contact with social services and @entity8 had stopped seeing the children			1
@entity8 , a paranoid schizophrenic , was sectioned under the @entity44 after threatening a relative with a knife in 2006 , when a referral was made to @entity89			1
but after her condition apparently improved , she was allowed unsupervised access to her children , who were in the care of mr @entity9			2
mrs @entity94 said their father was not told there was any risk to his children			1
she said : ' the children wanted to see their mother , and the father was led to believe that he could not prevent the mother from having contact			2
' he was not made aware that there was any risk to the children			2
in the absence of any word from social services , the parents made their own arrangements for contact			1
' when mental health and social services learned that further contact had taken place without their supervision , they acquiesced in the arrangement , and social services decided to close the file and take no further part in safeguarding the children			1
' after the short period of supervised contact , there was a total failure to carry out any risk assessment , the coroner said			0
an inquiry was launched when @entity8 was detained indefinitely after admitting two counts of manslaughter at the @entity131 in august 2007			0
the coroner said that mr @entity9 was a loving father and was not to blame for what happened to his children			1
' heartfelt condolences ' : @entity136 , director of children 's services at @entity139 , said social service work has since been ' transformed ' ' i hope he is able to make a good life for himself notwithstanding the terrible and enduring grief he must suffer , ' she added			2
in her narrative conclusions , she said the mother had delusions about her children , believing they had been swapped for her children who were stillborn			0
' she was prescribed medication but had probably stopped taking it for some days prior to the killings , ' the coroner said			0
mrs @entity94 said ' insufficient thought ' had been given to the possibility that @entity8 's condition was not fully controlled or that she may relapse			0
she said : ' there were serious and cumulative failures by social service and mental health workers to collaborate and liaise with each other , to fully share or request information from the other , and to inform and support the father			1
' mental health services focused on the mother 's condition and failed to assess the risk she might pose to the children			1
' social workers failed to carry out important tasks in a timely fashion or at all , partly because they had too much to do and were not adequately supported			1
' their managers failed to supervise or manage them in spite of obvious performance issues , poor working relationships , and staff absences and shortages			0
' the coroner said that because of various changes which have been made since , she would not be making any report to the authorities			0
@entity136 , director of children 's services at @entity139 , said the deaths were a ' terrible tragedy '			0
he said : ' our heartfelt condolences go out to mr @entity9 and his family			0
' as the coroner has identified , the social work service for children in @entity22 has been transformed over the last six years			2
we can never be complacent about our work to keep children safe and our social workers have studied carefully the issues in this tragic case			2
' in close partnership with colleagues in other services , we continue our vigilance to ensure we are together doing all that we possibly can to keep children safe			0
' inquest : social services and mental health workers made ' serious and cumulative failures ' the hearing at @entity55 , pictured , was told dr @entity209 , chief executive , @entity210 , said : ' we offer our deepest and most sincere condolences to the children 's father , grandparents and other family members			1
' we have worked very closely with our partners in the local authority , community services and the police to strengthen and improve our care and management of the whole family when the person with a mental illness is also a parent			0
' he said training is now mandatory to all staff that emphasise the importance of assessing needs to all children whose parent has a mental illness , even if they are not living together			0
he added : ' following this incident , the @entity234 issued guidance to all @entity238 trusts which has been embedded in our training			0
' @entity240 acknowledges that people with mental health problems should not be denied a relationship with their children			1
we recognise that they may pose a risk of emotional or physical harm to their children and this risk needs to be assessed and managed appropriately			0
' since 2007 , we have reviewed and improved practice in all our community mental health teams across the @entity210 and will continue to prioritise the needs of the whole family , including children			1
