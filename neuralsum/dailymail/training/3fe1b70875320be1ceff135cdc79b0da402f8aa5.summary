prison guard @entity1 filed the lawsuit after his wife , @entity3 , died of a heart attack at @entity6 hospital in @entity7 , @entity8 , along with her unborn twin boys in 2006			1
the heavily pregnant 31 - year - old was brought into the hospital 's emergency room on @entity24 , vomiting and with shortness of breath			1
by the time mr @entity1 parked his car and returned to the @entity28 , she 'd lost consciousness			0
less than an hour later , she suffered a fatal heart attack and her twins died with her , having been left inside her womb			1
but mr @entity1 is arguing the twins could have been saved if doctors had performed a perimortem cesarean section			0
despite being paged by the hospital , the on - call obstetrician , dr @entity36 , who was also @entity3 's personal obstetrician , never arrived			1
mr @entity1 recalls speaking to him on the phone			0
' he said , " well , what do you want to do ? take the babies ? take the babies ? " ' @entity1 told @entity43			0
' i kept responding , " i 'm not a doctor ! " ' a nurse listened for fetal heartbeats but did n't hear any so the @entity28 doctor @entity49 decided against a cesarean section			0
eventually all three were pronounced dead			0
two years later , mr @entity1 sued the hospital , dr @entity36 and dr @entity49 for the wrongful deaths of his wife and twins			2
the hospital , and the healthcare provider that runs it , @entity59 , which operated 78 @entity11 hospitals in 17 states , have argued that nothing could have been done to save ms @entity63			0
but despite claiming to follow the directives of the @entity66 of @entity67 that states the sanctity of life begins ' from the moment of conception until death , ' @entity59 's lawyers have turned the teachings of the @entity74 on their head in their defense against the twins ' deaths			2
hospital : @entity63 died of a heart attack at @entity6 hospital in @entity7 , @entity8 , pictured they are arguing that a fetus is not a person and ' unborn persons ' can not be the subject of a wrongful death case because they do not have the same rights as those born alive			1
one of the defense attorneys , @entity91 , argued in documents filed with the @entity93 that the judge ' should not overturn the long - standing rule in @entity8 that the term " person , " as is used in the @entity98 , encompasses only individuals born alive			1
@entity8 state courts define " person " under the @entity98 to include only those born alive			1
therefore @entity103 can not maintain wrongful death claims based on two unborn fetuses			2
' many @entity106 are supporting the @entity107 over the church in the court battle because they believe a win for the plaintiffs would be a win for pro-life advocates			2
the @entity59 attorneys have so far won decisions from @entity115 and the @entity116 based on this argument but in september , the @entity1 's appealed the case to the state @entity93			0
it is not yet clear whether the high court will hear the case or send it back to the appellate court .			0

@entity1 filed the lawsuit after his wife , @entity3 , died of a heart attack at @entity6 hospital in @entity7 , @entity8 , along with her unborn twin boys in 2006
the hospital 's lawyers claim ' the term " person , " as is used in the @entity98 , encompasses only individuals born alive *...* not unborn fetuses '
many @entity106 are *outraged* , believing the stance goes against the pro-life cause
