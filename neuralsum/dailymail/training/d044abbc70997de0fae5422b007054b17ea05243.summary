@entity1 striker @entity0 believes plenty of goals in a victory against @entity5 this weekend will be the perfect way to lift the club			1
the @entity9 champions appear to have lost their sparkle in recent games , with a shock @entity14 defeat by @entity15 on wednesday following a loss to @entity17 and a @entity18 draw at @entity19			1
@entity0 said : ' we need to be more determined and we need to score goals , because we are a team that scores more goals than everybody and when we do n't score we have problems			1
@entity0 fights off @entity26 in @entity1 's @entity14 tie with @entity15 ' it happened last night			1
i hope the next game we will score again			2
' we won this cup ( the @entity14 ) last year and we wanted to win it again			1
' unfortunately we did n't make it but now we must forget , recover well and think about the next game			2
' the next week could be critical to @entity1 's campaign			1
they already trail impressive leaders @entity36 by six points in the @entity9 and another loss to @entity5 could seriously damage their title defence			1
that game is quickly followed by a visit from @entity19 and anything less than victory in that game could leave them struggling to maintain interest in the @entity18			2
that in turn could put @entity50 under the spotlight			0
@entity0 is keen to fight for the @entity1 cause as he tries to stop @entity53 getting past him city manager @entity50 had a night to forget against @entity15			1
he made seven changes but two of the stars who did start , @entity55 and @entity57 , suffered injuries			0
@entity55 is now a doubt for the derby after limping out of the action with a knee problem after just nine minutes			0
toure was later withdrawn as a precaution due to a groin injury			0
asked what went wrong against @entity15 , @entity0 said : ' i think maybe the goal - they scored early			1
after that we tried , we played , we had some chances but we could n't score			0
' at the end they scored a second goal			0
' @entity55 is an injury worry for @entity15 and went off in the first - half of his side 's @entity14 loss like @entity0 , goalkeeper @entity82 also believes the @entity5 clash could offer the perfect opportunity to restore confidence			1
the @entity86 , signed in the summer from @entity50 's former club @entity87 , said : ' it 's a big opportunity for us to change this			0
we need to recover , forget about this match and only think about @entity5			2
' it 's always a really , really big match			0
when i have watched these games from my house you can tell how big it is			0
' for us it is a big opportunity , but we need a best performance from every player to win this game			2
' @entity105 derby games special - @entity103			0
