@entity0 has fought just four low - key rounds in the last 18 months after seeing prospective bouts against both @entity3 and @entity8 scrapped or postponed due to late - notice injuries to his opponents			1
but , far from fearing another disappointment as he enters the final build - up to their @entity15 and @entity16 heavyweight title showdown , @entity0 is intent on seeking out positives			2

' i usually start off two or three stones over the limit and am killing myself to get the weight off , but for this camp i was actually five pounds under my normal fighting weight			0
' this camp has been different and we will see on the night if it pays off but i 'm looking forward to getting in there and getting the win that will move me towards some world title fights			0
' @entity3 is gearing up for his eagerly - anticipated bout with @entity0 at @entity5 's @entity4 in november @entity0 shrugged off suggestions his previous crushing disappointments could have any negative impact on his career as he looks to close in on the likes of @entity52			1

' there is no question of not being focused , whatever happens			0
