by @entity0 published : 06:45 est , 10 may 2012 updated : 09:42 est , 10 may 2012 two of @entity3 's biggest contractors are teaming up with a @entity5 agency to create a ' space taxi ' for when astronauts need a quick lift away from this planet			1
currently , @entity3 must ' catch a ride ' from the @entity4 when astronauts want to visit the @entity11 , following the retirement of the space shuttle last year			1
exactly what fare @entity15 charges @entity3 for the 260 - mile trip is unknown , but @entity3 will certainly want to be less reliant on another nation for space jaunts			1
so now @entity3 is funding space taxi research with four separate companies - @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , and @entity24 , a startup owned by @entity26 founder @entity25			1
the @entity27 , taking a quick trip through @entity29 last month as it prepares for retirement at the @entity31 in @entity29 @entity3 is reviewing bids for at least two design contracts , valued at $ 300 million to $ 500 million apiece			2
the taxi service will be composed of recycled space shuttle parts along with a new @entity3 prototype spaceship			1
the contracts for @entity3 's so - called commercial crew program , is scheduled to be awarded this summer			2
@entity39 , which built the space shuttle booster rockets , teamed with @entity41 , a company that is one of the manufacturers of @entity5 's @entity45 rockets , to bid for @entity3 space taxi development funds last year but was not selected			1
the company continued to work on the project with its own funding , said @entity50 , a five - time shuttle astronaut who now serves as an @entity39 vice president and @entity53 program manager			2
@entity39 's new proposal adds a composite seven - person capsule , a launch escape system , propulsion module , avionics , an operations plan and other components for a complete space launch system			2
@entity50 said @entity53 could be ready to fly crew to the station in 2015 for less than what @entity15 charges for rides in its @entity67 capsules			0
@entity50 said : ' as a taxpayer , i want to get the best value out of what i 've invested into our government			0
for example , @entity74 1 ( rocket program ) was canceled , so to now pick up where the government left off is a very smart thing to do			0
it brings us the best value as a nation			0
' the @entity11 ( front ) says goodbye to the @entity85 as it heads back to @entity86 taxi driver : this is the pilot 's seat of the recently - retired @entity85 , as @entity3 looks around for a new company to get a lift from the @entity53 rocket 's first stage would be an extended space shuttle booster rocket , a design originally developed under @entity3 's now - canceled @entity74 1 rocket program			1
@entity53 's second - stage engine would be provided by @entity41			0
the newly announced capsule , also named @entity53 , is a composite spaceship developed by @entity3 as a potential alternative to the @entity102 deep - space capsule			2
@entity53 would fly from one of the space shuttle launch pads at the @entity105 in @entity106			1
depending on funding , test flights could begin in 2014			0
@entity50 said the capsules , which would parachute to a water landing , are designed to fly up to 10 times			0
in addition to carrying seven astronauts , the rocket and capsule could carry cargo to and from the space station , as well as be used for satellite launches and other missions			0
@entity50 declined to say how much @entity39 and its partners have spent developing the @entity53 system so far .			0
