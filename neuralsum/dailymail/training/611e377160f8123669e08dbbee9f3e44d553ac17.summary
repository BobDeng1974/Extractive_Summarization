she might have been flanked by some of the biggest names in world cinema but as @entity6 star @entity5 stepped onto the red carpet outside @entity9 's @entity8 , all eyes were on her			2
the reason ? a stunning quilted white gown by what has become her go - to label for big events , be they premieres , fashion shows or the @entity18 , @entity21 fashion house , @entity19			1
her polished red carpet look is a far cry from the early years of her career , which saw the gauche starlet suffer a series of wardrobe malfunctions and the odd fashion faux pas			0
she also managed a faux pas , quickly laughed off , when the plunging custom made @entity59 gown she wore to the @entity60 for the @entity6 afterparty in @entity9 last night slipped down to reveal a flash of nipple to gleeful photographers			0
nip slips notwithstanding , the last three years have seen ms @entity66 into a serious fashion player - and most of it is down to a series of well - chosen gowns by @entity19 , a label that also boasts @entity74 and @entity75 among its well - dressed legion of fans			2
indeed , so devoted to @entity19 is @entity46 , she has become a regular sight on the front row at the label 's shows and viewed the brand 's most recent couture outing from a perch beside @entity19 ceo @entity85			1
' some of the greatest red carpet moments in the last couple of years have come from @entity5 in @entity19 , ' comments fashion expert and blogger , @entity90			2
' it 's a very clever partnership on the brand 's side - they knew they were tapping into an actress who would " make it "			0
different style : in @entity19 at the @entity100 premiere of @entity101 last year , at a 2012 premiere in @entity103 and in @entity104 last november glamorous : the 24 - year - old in @entity19 at the @entity107 premiere of @entity108 , at the 2013 baftas and at a party in @entity100 last year impressive : @entity46 in a show - stopping white tiered creation on the red carpet at the @entity113 in @entity107 ' @entity5 fits the @entity19 aesthetic perfectly , ' he continues			1
' she favours the strapless gowns , and always the bigger , voluminous shapes which in turn make her stand out every time			0
' although @entity46 undoubtedly enjoys the perks of a close relationship with the fashion house - not least of which is a lucrative contract that has seen her become the face of @entity19 - some would argue that it is @entity19 that has benefited most			1
after all , how many actresses would have the guts to take to the red carpet at the @entity131 sporting a star - spangled tie - dye gown or would manage to pull off a sheer grey gown last seen fluttering down the catwalk during a premiere ? but while @entity46 has won plaudits for her sleek look , things have n't always gone to plan , not least when the actress managed to rip her dark blue @entity19 gown during the @entity142 in 2013 and tripped over the skirts of her voluminous frock during the @entity18 of the same year			1
nevertheless , as last night 's glamorous quilted frock proved , @entity46 is now a style icon to be reckoned with and left co-stars @entity45 , @entity148 and @entity149 looking dowdy in comparison as she appeared on the red carpet beside them			0
for that , there 's only one label to thank - the ever glamorous @entity155			0
ooops ! @entity46 's partnership with @entity19 has n't always gone to plan , not least when she tripped on her skirt at the 2013 @entity18 swift recovery : despite her fall , @entity5 was soon back on her feet and showed off her best actress @entity18 with pride @entity164 again ! despite her fall , @entity5 plumped for the same label - albeit a less voluminous design - for the 2014 @entity18 ringing the changes : the 24 - year - old chose a streamlined - and considerably less voluminous - scarlet dress for this year 's @entity18 support : @entity5 , who was - of course - wearing @entity19 , sat next to @entity19 ceo @entity85 on the @entity171 at @entity172 daring : not all of @entity5 's @entity19 gowns have been the safe option as this tie dye number ( left ) and sheer gown ( centre ) demonstrate sparkling : @entity5 chose sequinned @entity19 for the @entity142 in january this year and right , in the label for a @entity182 premiere last year			1

@entity5 , 24 , has a marked *preference* for gowns by @entity21 fashion house @entity19
wore a striking quilted white gown by the label for @entity190 premiere last night
also wore the label for this year 's @entity18 and @entity194 *ceremonies* and at scores of premieres
was *spotted* sitting next to @entity19 ceo @entity85 during @entity172 show in july
