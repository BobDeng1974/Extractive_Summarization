responding to the murder of @entity13 , the @entity14 of @entity1 in @entity15 , @entity16 , said those responsible must face ' killing , crucifixion and chopping of the limbs			0
' his judgement came as a @entity25 account linked to @entity26 , the @entity27 branch of the terror group , denounced the killing as ' conclusive proof of @entity32 ' deviance '			0
gruesome : @entity13 stands inside the cage where he was burned to death , in a frame taken from the video circulated by @entity5 militants yesterday showing the killing of the @entity8 fighter pilot barbaric : an @entity32 extremist lights a trail of petrol leading to the cage in which the 26 - year - old stands the so - called @entity5 showed the gruesome killing of @entity46 in a video on tuesday			1
he was captured in @entity49 in december when his plane went down during a bombing mission			0
footage circulated online showed the 26 - year - old locked in a cage , doused with fuel and torched			0
@entity8 immediately executed two @entity5 - linked death row prisoners in revenge for the killing			2
@entity61 clerics widely condemned @entity46 's burning , saying such a form of killing was considered despicable by @entity2 , no matter the context			1
the 1,000 - year - old @entity1 , which is revered by @entity2 around the world , issued a statement expressing ' deep anger over the lowly terrorist act ' by what it called a ' @entity72 ' group			1
grand sheikh @entity16 said the act ' requires the punishment mentioned in the @entity75 for these corrupt oppressors who fight against @entity78 and his prophet : killing , crucifixion or chopping of the limbs			1
' in @entity87 , the @entity82 , headed by prominent cleric @entity83 and linked to the @entity84 that has influence across the region , called the burning of @entity13 a criminal act			2
' @entity91 asserts that this extremist organisation does not represent @entity2 in any way and its actions always harm @entity2 , ' it said			1
condemnation : responding to @entity46 's murder , the @entity14 of @entity1 , pictured , in @entity15 , @entity16 , said those responsible must face ' killing , crucifixion and chopping of the limbs ' @entity102 : @entity8 executed two is - linked prisoners including @entity104 ( left ) hours after militants released the video that showed @entity13 ( right ) being burned alive @entity108 cleric @entity107 wrote on his @entity25 account : ' burning is an abominable crime rejected by @entity113 law regardless of its causes			1
' born as an offshoot of @entity10 , @entity5 was cast out of the international terror network last year in response to its brutality			2
@entity120 , @entity10 's chief , last february issued a statement dissociating his group from @entity5 , which it accused of ' forbidden bloodshed ' directed at fellow fighters			1
he said : ' we were n't informed about its creation , nor counselled			0
nor are we satisfied with it : rather we ordered it to stop ... nor is al â€“ @entity10 responsible for its actions and behaviour			0
' @entity5 is the successor of the @entity10 affiliate set up in @entity136 in 2004 by @entity137 to attack @entity139 occupation forces and @entity141 targets			2
@entity137 was , in fact , reprimanded for his sectarian violence by @entity144 and @entity120 , who feared @entity61 opinion would be alienated from @entity10 - advice that @entity137 ignored			0
after @entity137 was killed in 2006 , his successor , @entity147 , set up the @entity5 in @entity136 ( @entity148 ) and continued his mentor 's legacy of violence			1
it reemerged in 2011 as a jihadi fighting force in the civil war in @entity49 , now re-named as @entity32 , and earned a reputation for its rampant and gruesome violence , including beheadings and amputations			0
since then it has overrun vast swathes of both @entity136 and @entity49 , massacring those it deems ' infidels ' and controlling local @entity2 populations with its brutal interpretation of @entity163 law			1
' it is rejected whether it falls on an individual or a group or a people			2
only @entity78 tortures by fire , ' he added			0
in reply , @entity5 posted its own religious edict on @entity25 , which ruled that it is permissible in @entity2 to burn an infidel to death			1
however , senior clerics across the @entity113 world argued that inflicting death by fire was always banned under @entity2			1
' @entity181 , peace be upon him , advised against burning people with fire , ' @entity178 , head of the religious affairs department in southern @entity27 , told @entity184 in @entity185			0
and even @entity61 leaders sympathetic to the jihadist cause said the act of burning a man alive and filming the killing would damage @entity5 , which controls swathes of @entity49 and @entity136			1
@entity192 , a @entity8 @entity194 cleric who spent almost ten years in @entity8 prisons for militant activity , including a plot to attack @entity139 troops , said : ' this weakens the popularity of @entity5 because we look at @entity2 as a religion of mercy and tolerance			1
even in the heat of battle , a prisoner of war is given good treatment			0
' ' even if the @entity5 says @entity209 had bombed and burned and killed us , and we punished him in the way he did to us , we say , ok but why film the video in this shocking way ? ' @entity208 told @entity184			2
' this method has turned society against them			1
' @entity217 , a @entity139 - based monitoring service , quoted @entity219 , whom it described as a @entity108 jihadi , as saying on @entity25 it would have been better if @entity46 's captors had swapped him for ' @entity61 captives '			1
the killing would make ordinary people sympathetic to @entity13 , he said			0
of course , admirers of @entity5 cheered the killing			2
in a @entity25 message , a user called @entity228 said : ' to any pilot participating in the crusader coalition against the holy warriors - know that your plane might fall in the next mission			0
sleep well ! ' inconsolable : @entity236 ( centre ) , the father of @entity8 pilot @entity13 , is seen at the headquarters of the family 's tribe in the city of @entity244 today as he mourns the loss of his son clean cut : @entity8 officials have told the devastated family of the 26 - year - old ( pictured ) that they believed the footage to be genuine and that the man branded a ' hero ' in his homeland was dead many ordinary people across the @entity256 expressed disgust			0
' this a criminal , barbaric act which has no place in @entity2 or humanity			2
@entity2 bears no responsibility for them and their claim to be an @entity5 is ridiculous , ' said @entity263 , 43 , an engineer from @entity264 in the @entity265			1
' there should be a joint @entity268 force to go in and destroy these killers and be rid of them once and for all , ' he added			0
' i have never heard of any group that claims to be @entity61 and commits such atrocities , ' said @entity273 , a 22 - year - old university student in @entity274 , @entity27 's capital			2
the video circulated yesterday , titled ' healing the @entity276 ' , shows @entity46 in an orange jumpsuit doused in fuel , before militants set light to a trail of petrol leading up to the cage where he is held			0
flames quickly engulf the helpless pilot - images that are far too distressing to publish			0
extremists then pour debris , including broken masonry , over the cage , before it is flattened by a bulldozer .			0
