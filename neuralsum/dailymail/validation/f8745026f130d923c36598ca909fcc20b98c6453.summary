@entity0 has been challenged on live tv over whether he regrets ' stabbing his brother in the back ' to win the @entity5 leadership			1
he insisted that although the contest was ' bruising ' he thought he would make a better leader than brother @entity8 , and still does			1
it came as he was grilled by young voters on @entity11 , who questioned him about trust , drugs and being weird			1
the surprise decision by @entity0 , his less experienced younger brother , to stand against sent shock waves through @entity24 and plunged their relationship into the deep freeze			1
@entity0 proved victorious , narrowly securing the leadership with the support of the trade unions			2
but his decision to stand against his brother has proved to be one of the most potent aspects of his leadership remembered by voters , almost five years on			1
taking part in @entity11 's @entity39 programme , audience member @entity36 asked to applause : ' do you think the @entity42 would be in a better position if your brother was leader ? ' mr @entity0 replied : ' look i thought i was the best person for the job when i ran for leader , and i think that now			1
look , let me try to explain to you why i thought that			1
' it was obviously really tough for me to be in a contest with my brother , tough for him as well			1
i thought we needed to move on from @entity5			1
because i thought we 'd been a good government but on issues like @entity56 , inequality we got it wrong and we needed to move on			1
' i thought i was the best party to move the @entity42 on			1
and sure it was bruising and sure it was difficult but i thought that then and i think that now as well			1
' he was asked if he thought the @entity42 would be better off if his brother @entity8 had won the leadership election taking part in @entity11 's @entity39 programme , audience member @entity36 ( right ) asked mr @entity0 : ' so do you regret stabbing him in the back or not ? ' @entity18 had been seen as a frontrunner for the @entity5 leadership after @entity20 lost the election in 2010 but was narrowly beaten by younger brother @entity0 audience member @entity72 asked mr @entity0 what he would do if he found cannabis in his son 's bedroom @entity0 would not call the police if he found cannabis in his son 's bedroom			1
he was challenged by audience member @entity72 over whether he would support the decriminalisation of cannabis			1
he rejected the idea , insisting : ' we know that there are harmful effects			2
' i think the signal government sends is important			2
if the government sends a signal that cannabis use is somehow ok , and we know there ’s harder forms of cannabis and softer forms of cannabis , i think it ’s sending the wrong signal			1
' @entity72 responded : ' in a few years ’ time when your sons are teenagers and you find a bag of cannabis in your bedroom , will you be going to a doctor or will you be going to the police ? ' but the @entity5 leader insisted : ' i ’ll be going to neither			1
i ’d be discouraging from using it , absolutely i would			2
challenged on the issue again , mr @entity0 replied : ‘ i hope i ’d stop it happening in the first place			0
’ but @entity109 hit back with the stinging question : ' so do you regret stabbing him in the back or not ? ' while there was laughter from some in the audience , mr @entity0 appeared stony faced			0
that 's not the way i 'd describe it , ' he said			0
' that 's not the way i 'd describe it			0
look we both stood in this contest and we both offered different things to the @entity42			0
' it was a narrow victory for me , but i won the election , i won the contest			0
it was tough at the time and it 's obviously healed since then			1
' but you know i think the thing people are focussed on for the next 55 days is the choice between me and @entity135 , not me and @entity18			0
that 's obviously the contest at this election			0
' during the programme mr @entity0 was also tackled about whether his policies add , the lack of women in politics , rent controls and drugs policies			2
an audience member called @entity147 told the @entity5 leader : ' you are often portrayed as a bit strange , a bit weird			1
' ' i had n't heard that @entity147 , ' mr @entity0 said			0
' and you look like @entity153 , ' @entity147 added			0
' i had heard that , ' the @entity5 leader laughed			1
asked if any of that matters , mr @entity0 insisted it did not			2
' if you want this to be a beauty contest or a photo opp contest , then i 'm not going to win it			0
' ' i think there are other things that matter in a leader			2
i think ideas matter , to change the country , decency matters , and whtehr you hear the voices of people across the country			0
' i think you need someone in @entity172 who stands up for what they believe in			0
' awkwardly for mr @entity0 , his comments about being against photo opportunities came after he was pistured posing with his wife @entity178 in his kitchen			0
it has since emerged that it is the couple 's second kitchen in their smart @entity183 home			0
mr @entity0 was cheered when he promised to abolish the bedroom tax , telling the audience : ' it is mean , its unfair , two thirds of the people it hits are disabled people			0
' he also warned that people were being ' totally ripped off ' in the private rented sector , and promised three - year tenancies , with rents controlled so they ' ca n't just be jacked up by 10 per cent without warning ' , and letting agents will be banned from charging fees to tenants			0
he admitted the last @entity5 government did not do enough on rented housing			1
during the programme , mr @entity0 was grilled by young voters on @entity11 , who questioned him about trust , drugs and being weird an audience member called @entity147 told the @entity5 leader : ' you are often portrayed as a bit strange , a bit weird			1
' mr @entity0 also admitted that a lack of trust in politics remains an issue for all parties			2
' people know that politicians have broken their promises in the past			0
it 's not just @entity223			0
' my mission and what i 've tried to do is make sure everything i promise is funded , credible and deliverable			2
' judge me in government			0
i 've made sure that the promises i make are the promises i 'll keep			2
' my manifesto will be my contract with you			0
you will have to judge me on how i keep those promises			0
' some people in my party say why do n't you make bigger promises , and i say it 's because i want to be the first politician to under - promise and over-deliver , instead of over-promise and under - deliver			2
