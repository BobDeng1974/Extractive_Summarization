a huge fire has brought to end a mock @entity2 mission being held in the middle of the @entity5 desert			1
the mission involved four ' astronauts ' living in isolation for two weeks in the hope of recreating the psychological effects of life on @entity2			1
but instead , they were dealt with a real - life emergency when an accidental fire destroyed part of the @entity17 , with flames reaching 10ft ( 3 metres ) high			1

the mission involved four ' astronauts ' living in isolation in the hope of recreating the psychological effects of life on @entity2 the @entity25 , who runs the missions , said that no one was hurt among the crew who attempted to battle the flames on their own for over an hour			1
according to @entity33 , crew commander @entity32 , spotted smoke billowing from the greenhouse and ran outside to take a look			2
' this is a moment where instinct took over , the instinct of fight or flight , and we had fight , ' @entity32 told @entity33			2
' there really was n't a question at the moment			2

@entity32 's crew stayed in @entity65 , four miles from the habitat , and commuted back and forth to @entity17 and coordinated with emergency officials before deciding to end the simulation on december 31			0
the @entity55 that was destroyed was the second greenhouse built at @entity17 , after the first one collapsed under heavy winds			0
' the @entity55 fire was very unfortunate , and the crew that bravely dealt with the incident ended their simulation early , ' @entity72 , the @entity25 's director of media told @entity78			2
during their stay , the astronaut 's home is the @entity83 , a two storey silo - shaped building with lab areas and living spaces , eight metres in diameter ' but the @entity17 is up and running , albeit temporarily without greenhouse experiments , which is just one aspect of the important research being done at the facility			2
' another crew arrived at the @entity5 station a week or so after the fire to begin their two week @entity2 field simulation			1
we 're back to preparing for @entity2 exploration and settlement			1
' a volunteer for the mock mission , @entity104 , had previously told @entity78 that the mission can be overwhelming			0

the @entity25 said they will aim to have a replacement structure ready in time for next batch of ' astronauts ' to live at the @entity5 station sending a manned mission to @entity2 is ' necessary if the human race is to survive ' , @entity125 chiefs have said			1
speaking at the humans to @entity2 summit in @entity130 , head of the @entity133 space programme @entity134 , said last year : ' if this species is to survive indefinitely we need to become a multi-planet species , we need to go to @entity2 , and @entity2 is a stepping stone to other solar systems			1
' mr @entity134 revealed plans for the series of ' stepping stones ' to the red planet , which included ' lassoing ' an @entity144 also included growing plants in space , and using 3d printers for onboard repairs			0
@entity125 plans to capture an asteroid by 2015 and take it into the moon 's orbit , send a spaceship to it and collect samples before returning home in less than a month round trip			0
the experiments being conducted in @entity5 and a sister station in the @entity158 are designed to help scientists learn more about what astronauts would endure on such a trip leaving the @entity163 requires a request to @entity165 a day in advance			1
even then , they have to put on an unwieldy spacesuit			0
the suits worn by the scientists come with their own air - conditioning , radio units , heavy helmets , and boots			0
contact with the outside world is strictly limited , with a very slow internet connection restricted to allow just a few emails in and out each day			0
most communication is with ' mission control ' , who asked the crew for reports on every aspect of their lives during their two - week shifts			0
that includes details on their food intake , exercise , and psychological status			2

the shortest possible journey to @entity2 is 140 million miles , a trip that is thought to take around seven months			1
