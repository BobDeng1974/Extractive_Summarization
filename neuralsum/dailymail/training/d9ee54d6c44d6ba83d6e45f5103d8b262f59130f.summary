by @entity0 published : 10:07 est , 30 april 2013 updated : 10:47 est , 30 april 2013 she made her name with we need to take about @entity4 , a book about a mass - murderer 's mother 's struggle to accept her son 's killings			1
the novel that was turned down by 30 publishers before @entity13 launched it to cult status was adapted to a hit film starring @entity17			0
and now edgy writer @entity18 is back with another shocking book , but this one is a lot closer to home			1
@entity18 poses after winning the @entity23 for @entity24 in 2005 2011 film @entity24 by @entity27 director @entity26 starred @entity28 actress @entity17 @entity29 tells the story of @entity31 , a middle - aged woman who moves in with her obese older brother , @entity34 , to help him lose weight on an extreme liquid diet			1
her very own older sibling @entity37 was obese , weighing 24 stone at his heaviest			1
he suffered from diabetes , was reliant on a portable oxygen tank , and died of cardiac arrest in 2002			0
despite the apparent similarities @entity18 professes the family in @entity29 bears no resemblance to her own			1
unsurprisingly for someone who has experienced such tragedy , @entity18 is in unbelievably good shape for her 55 years - the same age her brother was when he died			1
she admits to embarking on a torturous diet and exercise regime in an interview with @entity53 , and reveals some eccentric views on life and health			2
' we are meant to be hungry , ' she says			1
' it 's more exciting and enjoyable to be striving for something than to actually get it			0
' @entity18 , pictured with husband @entity61 , says we are meant to be hungry			1
obesity was an issue in her family she cycles everywhere and has a meticulous daily exercise regime consisting of 130 press - ups , 200 side crunches , 500 sit - ups and 3,000 star jumps			0
even with all this exercise to consider @entity18 still does n't eat anywhere near enough food to actually put weight on , skipping lunch entirely in favour of a bowl of popcorn			2
somewhat haunted by obesity , @entity18 wards the disease away from herself while indulging in voyeuristic television on the topic			2
' over the years i 've watched an appalling number of tv shows like half @entity89 and @entity90 - i 'm a real sucker for all that			2
' while she puts pressure on herself to stay slim , she does n't believe women should be pushed to extremes by the media			0
' i would rather see models weigh a little more , ' she tells @entity53			0
i 'm especially antagonistic to computer - fiddling			0
' so not only do you take women who are improbably thin to begin with but then you start shaving away bits of them until there 's not even room for their intestines anymore			0
' @entity29 is out 9 may ( Â£ 16.99 , @entity106 )			0
