ice in @entity1 is melting partly because of heat from the @entity4 's mantle , according to a team of international researchers			1
the group claims that they are the first to find a connection between melting of the @entity1 ice sheet and the high heat flow from the @entity4 ’s mantle			1
the findings , they suggest , could have implications for future predictions on climate change and the reasons behind ice melt in the region			1
in total , the @entity21 ice sheet contains an amount of ice that would lead to a rise of global sea level by more than seven metres , if completely melted the @entity1 ice sheet is often considered an important contributor to future global sea - level rise over the next century or longer			0

the ice loss from the ice sheet has been increasing over the last decade , with half of it attributed to changes in surface conditions with the remainder due to increased iceberg calving - the process by which ice detaches from the glacier to become an iceberg			2
the international research initiative @entity47 , led by the @entity49 , said that the effect of the @entity4 's crust and upper mantle in current climate modelling are too simplistic			1
they modelled the @entity4 ’s mantle against the ice sheet and found that melting occurs in a given area due to the composition of the mantle underneath it			1
the team modelled the @entity4 's mantle against the ice sheet and found that melting occurs in a given area due to the composition of the mantle underneath it writing in the current online issue of @entity68 , the group argues that this effect can not be neglected when putting together data on climate change			1
the @entity1 ice sheet loses about 227 gigatonnes of ice per year and contributes about 0.7 millimeters to the currently observed mean sea level change of about 3 mm per year			2
the team point out , however , that existing model calculations were based on a consideration of the ice cap			2
@entity49 scientists @entity78 and @entity80 have now combined earlier ice and climate models with their new thermo - mechanical model for the @entity1 lithosphere			1
‘ we have run the model over a simulated period of three million years , and taken into account measurements from ice cores and independent magnetic and seismic data ’ , said @entity78			0
the researchers believe that the coupling of models of ice dynamics with thermo - mechanical models of the solid earth allows a more accurate view of the processes that are melting the @entity1 ice ‘ the temperature at the base of the ice , and therefore the current dynamics of the @entity1 ice sheet is the result of the interaction between the heat flow from the earth 's interior and the temperature changes associated with glacial cycles , ’ said @entity80 who initiated @entity100			1
‘ we found areas where the ice melts at the base next to other areas where the base is extremely cold			0
’ the current climate is influenced by processes that go far back into the history of @entity4 : the @entity1 lithosphere is 2.8 to 1.7 billion years old and is only about 70 to 80 km thick under @entity1			2

we could refreeze the @entity124 , and it would n't even cost that much , a scientist claims			0
two published studies explore the possibility that a technological solution could be found to the problem of global warming melting the ice caps on the @entity132			0
the scientist who is lead author on both claims that ' any significant nation ' could find the resources to carry out the operation			0
the only significant question , he says , is whether we should			0
@entity139 , professor of applied physics at @entity141 , is lead author on papers published in @entity143 and @entity144 which speculate as to how we could restore the polar ice			0
he used climate models to suggest injecting reflective particles into the atmosphere could reduce the amount of sunlight reaching the @entity4 , engineering a regional effect that could bring ice back to the @entity124			1
his paper claims that by reducing the penetration of sunlight by just 0.5 per cent is could be possible to restore the sea - ice around the @entity132 back to pre-industrial era levels			0
his second paper suggests the whole operation could be accomplished with just a few modified @entity162 jets , costing somewhere in the region of $ 8billion a year			0
however , while he believes action must be taken to tackle the amount of pollution spewed into the @entity4 's atmosphere , he does n't yet advocate the kind of action his papers suggest			1

study suggests melting in an area is due to composition of @entity4 's mantle
the @entity100 team claims they produced more accurate forecasts by adding their new findings to earlier models on climate change
