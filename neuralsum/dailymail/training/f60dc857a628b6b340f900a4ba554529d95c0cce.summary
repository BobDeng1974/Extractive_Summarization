there is a lot of grumbling on the way here - and not just from me			1
my wife 's grievance is that , having given up alcohol for january , why on earth do we need to starve for a week in a remote part of @entity11 where we 're bound to be confined to barracks because the weather will be foul			1
i do n't have the nerve to tell her we 'll be pretty much confined to barracks whatever the weather , with an exhaustive timetable of treatments and deprivations			1
my main worry is how to survive without coffee			1
but a friend had said we should ' throw ourselves into it ' and throw ourselves into it we do			1
@entity26 is the latest offering in homage to @entity29 ( 1875 - 1965 ) , the @entity30 physician who believed that health is centred in the gut			1
@entity26 : more a sanatorium than a spa resort , albeit the most glamorous in the world ... in other words , get the plumbing right and everything flows nicely			1
this outpost near @entity40 in @entity41 , about an hour south of @entity42 , has been open just over a year			1
it 's a modernist monastery - all glass and wood and acres of calm space - built in a square around an outside courtyard with views of snow - capped mountains			1
the 70 huge rooms are immaculately white , with more cupboards than in most one - bedroom flats			1
ours has two bathrooms - or , at least , two loos - which is a brilliant idea given the circumstances			1
my loo seat opens automatically when i stand in front of it			1
when we arrive at 8pm on a saturday most guests already have repaired to their rooms			1
dinner , such as it is , starts at 5pm			1
but because we have not yet met the doctor and been given our programme , we are allowed soup and tender lamb chops for our first meal			2
@entity40 in @entity41 , about an hour south of @entity42 , is the location of the newest @entity29 clinic a member of staff quietly explains that we are not allowed to drink with our food and that we must chew everything 40 times before swallowing			1
that pretty much rules out conversation - which is no bad thing , either , occasionally			2
she also tells us to pick up our @entity86 salts on the way to bed , which are to be drunk as soon as we wake up and at least half an hour before breakfast			1
we 're given a copy of the bible - dr @entity91 's @entity92 : the @entity93			2
not the sexiest of titles			2
our first morning does not start well			2
we sleep through breakfast ( served from 7am to 8.30am ) and have to ask for special dispensation to have our tiny bowl of spelt porridge			2
then we are measured and weighed			2
i 'm nearly a stone and a half overweight , but am quickly told it 's not a matter of burning more calories and that the doctor will see me shortly			2
he thinks i could do with a liver detox ( there 's a surprise ) , some deep tissue massages ( yes , please ) , plus a couple of intravenous ( i hate needles ) ' infusions ' and various other treatments , including one called the ' hay pack '			1
then he gives us detoxifying drops and acid - based capsules to be taken before meals and wishes us well			2
a modernist monastery : all glass and wood and acres of calm space , with views of snow - capped mountains my wife and i are put on the @entity130 diet for the first two days			2
level 1 is harsh : yoghurt and stale bread for breakfast ( good for chewing ) , same again at lunch and a pot of herbal tea for dinner			2
a buzz phrase here is ' the luxury of austerity '			0
the stale bread is crucial			0
it means you have to chew , and the more you chew , the better			0
saliva already gets to work breaking the food down so the gut has a much easier time further along the food chain , as it were			0
' but where will the energy come from ? ' i had asked the doc. ' the detox , ' he had said in that @entity157 way that you do not question			0
there 's a gorgeous outdoor saltwater pool near the gym , but i have n't the energy to try it for the first four days			0
i have n't the energy for very much , actually			0
this is not a spa resort , more a sanatorium , albeit the most glamorous sanatorium in the world			0
we are patients , not guests			1
the word ' therapy ' is used a lot			0
' go with it , ' a member of staff tells my wife , who , when not being treated , is in bed , the low point coming on day three when she hisses : ' thanks so much for bringing me on this lovely holiday			0
' the ' hay pack ' is a packet of straw that is placed round your liver , with a hot compress wrapped over it ; ' energy island ' involves lying on hot sand and staring up at lights that change colour ; something called @entity190 is to do with the mind taking control of your muscles - at least i think that 's right			0
in the gym , fit young things come up with all kinds of exercises to improve balance , tone tummies and increase flexibility			0
@entity26 is all magnificently professional , discreet , caring , supportive			1
i turn native on day three and my big break - through comes on day four , when i bounce out of bed at 6.15am and join the communal 7am ' awakening in the forest ' session , where i imagine we 'll be chanting ' the person i want to be is me ! ' but in fact we just do some gentle warm - ups and watch the sky turn red behind the mountains			0
i 've hardly eaten a thing , but i 'm a bundle of energy			0
i want to get things done			0
my skin is softer and less drawn			0
my eyes have rediscovered their sparkle ( my wife assures me ) and my belt has tightened by two notches			0
seeing the doctor the day before our departure is like an audience with the headmistress			0
she is pleased with me			1
my abdomen has less gas and air in it and if i keep going once back in the real world , my life ' could change for ever '			0
i 've also lost nearly 7lb			0
more importantly , i feel better than i have for years			0
@entity235 's seven - night basic programme ( 0049 8022 18800 , www.lanserhof.com ) costs from £ 2,824 pp , including all meals			0
@entity238 ( www.easyjet.com ) flies from @entity239 to @entity42 from £ 60 return			1
one week 's @entity242 parking at @entity243 with @entity244 ( 0844 871 7521 , www.aph.com ) costs from £ 89.95 .			1

@entity26 sits around an hour south of @entity42 in rural @entity41

@entity253 *writer* was pleased with the results after a week of restraint
