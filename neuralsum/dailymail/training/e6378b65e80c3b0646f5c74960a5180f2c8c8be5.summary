when in @entity1 , it 's tempting to try the city 's world - famous ice cream			2
but some @entity6 tourists were left with a nasty aftertaste – a £ 54 bill			1
following their complaints over being charged £ 13.50 each for their take - away cones , an @entity10 politician has called for a clampdown on such extortionate prices			1
outraged : holidaymakers @entity16 , his brother @entity16 and their wives @entity20 and @entity21 with the receipt for their ice cream @entity16 and @entity24 , 58 and 68 , and their wives @entity20 , 61 , and @entity21 , 69 , all from @entity27 in the @entity28 , were landed with the astonishing bill on sunday , the last day of their holiday			1
the group had stopped at the @entity34 ice cream parlour and bar close to the famous @entity36 in the city centre			2
although they requested three scoops of ice cream each , they avoided numerous toppings and extras , wary of mounting costs , so they were shocked when they were charged so much			2
@entity16 said : ' how can they get away with charging £ 50 for four ice cream cones ? ripped off : the scandal is reigniting a row in the country about tourists being ' ripped off ' by local businesses ' the cones had three flavours and a couple of wafers but if we wanted whipped cream that was another three euros on top each			1
we knew prices were expensive if you sat down , but we took the ice creams away – how much would it have cost us if we had sat down ? ' mr @entity16 , a company executive , said the group had been on a six - day trip to @entity1 , adding : ' up until then we 'd had a brilliant time , but that left a bad taste in the mouth – quite literally			1
to be honest the ice cream was n't that nice either			2
we 'd had better ones earlier on in the holiday			0
' i felt i had been ripped off but what could i do ? ' @entity72 , a local councillor , said of the tourists ' ordeal : ' they were justifiably outraged at what they had been asked to pay , and it should not be allowed			1
there needs to be a clampdown on places like this that charge extortionate prices to unsuspecting tourists			1
' it does nothing for the image of the city and will probably put people off coming here			0
' mr @entity72 added that he had personally offered to refund the money to the group but they had told him donate it to a charity			0
the ice cream parlour in question gave a chilly response			0
a staff member who refused to give her name said : ' the prices are clearly on display			0
they got what they asked for – four ice creams			0
' @entity105 cost : the family were horrified by the high price after buying ice creams at the @entity34 bar ( left of picture ) in @entity1 she said the gelateria 's most expensive cone is 25 euros ( £ 21 ) and added : ' they got 16 euros ' worth of ice cream each – almost a kilo			1
what more did they want ? ' we get this all the time … but the prices are there in black and white			0
if they do n't want the ice cream they can go somewhere else			0
' @entity126 , president of @entity10 's @entity128 consumer group , said it had officially requested ' an immediate investigation into this fraud '			0
have you been ripped off on holiday in a similar way to the @entity135 ? tell us what happened to you by emailing editorial@dailymailonline.co.uk tourist spot : the bar is near the @entity36 , one of the most popular attractions in the @entity10 capital			2

@entity16 , brother @entity144 , and wives ordered four cones
they cost a staggering 16 euros a piece
reignited a row in country about tourists being ' ripped off ' by businesses
