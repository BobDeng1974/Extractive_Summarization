unravelling : while being interviewed about the robbery , @entity0 revealed to detectives she had witnessed the murder of her sister @entity4 the father who murdered his teenage daughter @entity7 was prepared to flee the country with a briefcase of gold bars in order to escape justice , it was claimed today			1
@entity14 , 51 , and his wife @entity13 , 49 , were jailed for life last week after they were found guilty of killing the 17 - year - old			1

@entity4 disappeared from the family home in @entity24 in 2003 and her body was later found in the @entity26 , in @entity27			1
she ’d become known to social workers shortly before she vanished after being abused by her parents			0
solicitor @entity30 , who worked as head of law at @entity33 at the time , revealed that when officials visited the home @entity37 had prepared a briefcase so he and his family could leave the country at the ' drop of a hat '			1
she told the @entity43 : ' when she disappeared , we had a child protection conference with the various agencies , like the police and social services			0
' a social worker had been round to the house and we knew there was a briefcase in the hall which had gold bars and his children ’s passports in it , just in case he had to leave the country at the drop of a hat			1
he was ready to flee the country if it came to it			0
' ms @entity30 , now an expert in honour violence and forced marriages , said the couple had shown little concern about @entity4 ’s disappearance			2
she said : ' the parents did n’t report her missing and they refused to cooperate			0
all the information we had came from social services			0
' there was no remorse or regret			0
there was no urgency or panic that their daughter had vanished			0
' there was no ‘ oh @entity83 , where is she ? ’ , or ‘ we ’re really worried about her ’ , ‘ where is she sleeping tonight ? ’ she added that officials had known @entity4 ' was n’t coming back ' and the ' gut feeling ' was her parents were responsible			2
honour killing : @entity94 , 52 , and his wife @entity13 , 49 , of @entity24 , @entity96 , suffocated their 17 - year - old daughter @entity4 with a plastic bag because she refused an arranged marriage inside the courtroom : @entity94 stood impassively as the verdicts were given while his spouse wiped tears from her eyes with a tissue crucial evidence : the arrest of @entity0 ultimately led to the conviction of her parents @entity94 and @entity7 ( pictured ) as @entity112 and mrs @entity7 were jailed for life , social services were accused of missing several key warning signs in the run - up to @entity4 's death			1
the killers were exposed only after @entity4 's younger sister plucked up the courage to tell how she and her siblings watched them suffocate her in 2003			1
mr justice @entity121 said ' westernised ' @entity122 simply wanted a normal life but found herself ' squeezed between two cultures '			1
he then made a thunderous attack on the morals of the parents standing in front of him at @entity131			0
' what was it that brought you two , her parents , the people who had given her life , to the point of killing her ? ' he asked them			0
' you chose to bring up your family in @entity24 but your social and cultural attitudes were those of rural @entity146			2
victim : @entity4 as a child with her mother at the family 's @entity151 home ' @entity4 was a determined , able and ambitious girl who wanted to live a life which was normal in the country in which you had chosen to live and bring up your children			1
however , you could not tolerate the life that @entity4 wanted to live			1
' you wanted your family to live in @entity146 in @entity24			2
' although she went to local schools , you objected to her socialising with girls from what has been referred to as the white community			0
you objected to her wearing @entity164 clothes and you objected to her having contact with boys			0
' she was being squeezed between two cultures , the culture and way of life that she saw around her and wanted to embrace , and the culture and way of life you wanted to impose on her			1
' he said the fact her siblings witnessed the murder was ' a truly horrifying feature ' of the case which had ' blighted ' their lives too			0
he ordered both @entity94 , 52 , and his 49 - year - old wife to serve a minimum of 25 years in prison			1
@entity4 's efforts to escape her parents ' iron grip were thwarted by what criminologist dr @entity188 called a ' catastrophic ' communication breakdown as social workers took her reluctance to make allegations of abuse at face value			1
dr @entity188 , an expert in ' honour killings ' who appeared for the prosecution , said that but for that @entity4 may still have been alive today			2
born and raised in @entity151 , @entity4 's aspirations forced her to lead a ' secret life ' , spending money from her evening job on buying ' @entity164 ' clothes and a mobile phone and enjoying flirtatious chats with young @entity21 men			1
those aspirations clashed with her parents , who expected a compliant , demure future bride fit to marry a cousin she had never met in @entity146			0
@entity4 was subjected to regular beatings			2
in her own words , found in an application for housing help , she wrote : ' regular incidents since i was 15 - 16 years			2
one parent would hold me while the other hit me			0
' as the eldest daughter , her fate had already been determined 4,000 miles away in the village of @entity225 in @entity146 's north - eastern frontier			2
suspected family figurehead @entity227 had proposed marriage on behalf of his son , whom @entity4 had never met			0
the siblings : @entity231 , left , and @entity232 , right , and the youngest sister , who can not be named for legal reasons , all broke down in tears as the verdict was read out led away : @entity94 and @entity7 were two traditionalist disciplinarians who had very fixed ideas about how their children , particularly their daughters , should behave several times she fled the family home , but aged 16 she was packed off to @entity146			1
in desperation she drank bleach , known locally as ' scrub ' , causing horrific injuries			0
her aunt @entity246 said : ' i still believe it was a mistake she took scrub and did not intend to kill herself , but what happened was very bad … ' she was in great , great pain and we rushed her to hospital where they washed her stomach and saved her			0
she was kept under treatment for three days but her throat was badly damaged – she struggled to swallow even liquid			0
' astonishingly , the family recalls , the incident merely served to fuel mrs @entity7 's anger because @entity4 had ' made a scene '			2
after months in hospital back home in @entity151 , @entity4 set about resuming a westernised lifestyle			0
crucially , however , she had now lost her ' value ' as a potential bride , her body ravaged by the effects of poor medical treatment in @entity146			0
on september 11 , 2003 , another – fatal – row began after @entity4 was picked up from her evening job wearing a short - sleeved top and white stiletto boots			2
her body was found beside a river in @entity27 in february 2004 but the breakthrough in the case did not come until 2010 when @entity4 's sister @entity279 – only 15 at the time of the murder – was arrested over a mysterious robbery at the family home and finally told police she had witnessed the killing			1
now 24 , she said their mother began the attack with the words ' just finish it here ' , before her father stuffed a plastic bag in @entity4 's mouth , holding it there until she stopped breathing			1
their brother @entity232 , then 13 , later told his sisters ' she deserved it ' , @entity279 said , telling of watching her parents wrap @entity4 's body in bin bags before her father carried it to a car			1
yesterday , at the end of the ten - week trial , mrs @entity7 wept as she was found guilty , while her taxi driver husband grimaced then uttered an obscenity at detectives			0
police suspect someone helped dispose of @entity4 's body , and further prosecutions could follow			1
scouring for clues : forensic officers comb the riverbank next to the @entity26 in in @entity316 , near @entity317 , @entity27 , where where @entity4 's body was found @entity319 discovery : @entity4 disappeared in september 2003 and her body was found on the bank of the @entity26 in @entity27 the following february			1

@entity94 , 52 , and wife @entity13 , 49 , of @entity24 , @entity96 , suffocated the 17 - year - old with a plastic bag
judge : ' @entity4 was squeezed between two cultures - the culture she wanted to embrace and the one you wanted to impose on her '
their children @entity232 , @entity333 and the youngest , who can not be named for legal reasons , all broke down in tears as the verdict was read out
@entity4 's close friend , @entity338 : ' we have waited for this day for many years as her killers roamed free '
her father @entity94 was prepared to leave country with stash of gold bars to evade justice
