by @entity0 , @entity1 published : 10:07 est , 29 november 2012 updated : 09:52 est , 30 november 2012 budget airline @entity2 has imposed a new blanket £ 6 a head ‘ website administration fee ’ on its customers - plus a 2 per cent booking fee on those who pay by credit card			1
customers who pay by credit card face the double - whammy of having to pay @entity14 charges , the no - frills airline confirmed			1
but @entity2 flew into a major row by claiming that the moves had been forced on it by @entity19 competition watchdogs at the @entity20 ( @entity20 ) - a charge which they vociferously denied			2
@entity22 , @entity2 's chief executive , will impose a new 2 per cent credit card processing fee on all new bookings made from friday ( file picture ) the @entity20 criticised @entity2 for ' springing ' on extra charges			1
pictured , @entity2 fees before the fee change until now , passengers booking @entity2 tickets with either a credit card or a debit card faced a £ 6 ‘ admin fee ’ unless they paid with the airline ’s special pre-paid ‘ @entity33 ’			1
but the @entity20 ruled in july that this was unfair and that debit card customers should not pay an admin fee unless it is shown in the headline price			1
there should be no extra charge for paying debit card			2
so in retaliation , @entity2 says everyone will now pay the £ 6 admin fee – and credit card customers will in addition pay a new 2 % booking charge			1
and it sought to blame the @entity20 for the added costs			2
it means a family booking by credit card faces its costs soar			2
the row erupted when the @entity55 no - frills carrier announced it was bringing in a new 2 per cent credit card processing fee on all new credit card bookings made from friday			1
it also announced that from friday its passengers would also have to pay a £ 6 administration fee to cover the airline 's ‘ website costs ’			1
the airline claimed it was making the announcement ’ in order to comply with the @entity19 @entity20 's recent ruling on credit card fees ’			2
@entity2 said later it was ‘ disappointed , but not surprised ’ by the @entity20 ’s ‘ attempt to distance themselves from their anti-consumer rulings			0
’ it then cheekily ‘ invited the @entity20 to pay these increases on the passengers ’ behalf			0
’ @entity2 ’s @entity76 said : ’ @entity2 is disappointed , but not surprised , by the @entity20 ’s attempt to distance themselves from their anti-consumer rulings			0
' before the @entity20 imposed these baseless changes , airlines could partner with card providers to allow their cardholders the exclusive advantage of avoiding such fees			0
‘ as the @entity20 has removed our ability to help passengers avoid fees through exclusive partnerships perhaps they may wish to pay these fees on the consumers ’ behalf			0
’ but a furious @entity20 ( @entity20 ) issued a strong denial saying this was absolutely not the case and that the extra charge was totally unnecessary			0
however , the move came as @entity2 was forced by the competition watchdogs to scrap unfair charges on debit cards and to remove a lack of transparency in the booking process which saw unfair charges ‘ sprung ’ on passengers at the last minute			0
but the @entity20 insisted : ‘ we have not required any airline to introduce new payment charges , increase their credit card charges or scrap any discounts they wish to offer			1
’ the @entity20 added : ‘ we took action to make sure that debit card charges are included in the headline price and credit card charges are transparent and not sprung on shoppers towards the end of the booking process			1
’ @entity2 will also introduce an across the board £ 6 administration fee ( file picture ) those using @entity2 's ‘ cash passport ’ scheme in @entity55 , @entity122 and @entity123 will be able to avoid administration fees until february 1 , february 15 and march 21 2013 respectively			1
in july the @entity20 told 12 airlines , including @entity2 that they could not charge a fee to customers paying with debit cards , which were considered the same as cash			1
at the time @entity2 charged a £ 6 card fee per person per booking , it said			2
nor could they allow only their own debit cards to be used			0
@entity2 defended its actions and said it was continuing to ‘ deliver the lowest fares and a no - fuel surcharges guarantee to all our passengers ' , and that ‘ passengers could avoid credit card fees by paying with a debit card			1
’ @entity2 ’s @entity76 , said : ‘ to cover our credit card processing costs and to comply with the @entity19 @entity20 ’s recent ruling , we are introducing a 2 % credit card handling fee from 30 november 2012			1
‘ he said @entity2 ’s ‘ avoidable ’ 2 % credit card fee can be avoided by using debit cards ( including @entity33 cards ) or @entity122 @entity148 transfer			1
a @entity2 statement noted : ’ in addition , @entity2 ’s € 6 / £ 6 admin fee ( which covers costs associated with @entity2 ’s website , www.ryanair.com ) will apply to all new bookings made from 30 november , except those bookings made using a @entity33 in @entity55 , @entity122 and @entity123 , where admin fees can be avoided until 1 february , 15 february and 21 march 2013 , respectively			1
‘ to rub in the message , @entity2 insisted : ‘ this will bring all of @entity2 ’s @entity161 operations in line with its @entity19 procedures , following the @entity20 ’s ruling			2
' @entity2 and its outspoken chief executive @entity165 has already come under fire from consumer groups and aviation watchdogs for luring customers in with low fares then charging sky - high fees for ‘ the extras ’ - and has even threatened to charge for use of the toilets			2
mr @entity165 admitted to @entity177 magazine : ' of course i fly @entity2 , but it costs me a fortune in excess baggage			0
’ in july this year @entity2 and 11 other airline companies were told they could not charge a fee to customer paying by debit card ( file picture ) but the opinionated airline chief has no sympathy for other passengers who fall foul of his tightly drawn rules			1
recalling the recent case of passenger and mother - of - two @entity192 , who received backing from nearly half a million @entity195 users when she was forced to pay £ 236 to print boarding passes for her family so they could fly home to @entity19 from @entity199 , @entity123			0
mr @entity165 told ‘ @entity177 : ‘ recently a customer turned up at @entity199 with no boarding passes for her family			0
' she was fined € 60 for each reissue			0
so she gets on ' the @entity203 ' to complain			0
' emboldened by the rising tide of support , mrs @entity192 asks for compensation , to which we replied politely but firmly , thank you , mrs @entity192 , but it was your f * * * up			0
we 're not changing our policy			0
’ the mother - of - two , from @entity215 , @entity213 had criticised @entity2 ’s rule that travellers must print boarding passes up to two weeks before flying , or face a £ 60 per ticket charge at the airport			2
at the time of the boarding card row mr @entity165 launched an astonishing rant against his own customers - branding those who do n’t like paying for their boarding cards as ' idiots ' who should ‘ b * * * * * off ’			0
passengers who arrive for flights without a boarding pass are ‘ stupid ’ and should pay a penalty to have one printed at the check - in desk because it is their ‘ f * * * up ’			0
on its website the airline carries a table of what it terms ‘ optional ’ fees and another saying ‘ click here to see how to avoid paying optional fees			0

@entity2 will bring in a new 2 per cent credit card processing fee *tomorrow*
no - frills airline will also introduce an across the board £ 6 admin fee to cover ' website costs '
in july company was told by @entity20 it could not charge a fee to debit card customers
flight bosses blame the new charges on the @entity20 - a claim the watchdog denies
