by @entity0 published : 05:19 est , 20 december 2012 updated : 07:02 est , 20 december 2012 this year 's @entity2 lectures are set to wow audiences with a trio of explosive experiments			1
the lectures will explore the theme of @entity8 , unpicking the chemistry of @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity13 - three ancient ' elements ' that puzzled science for centuries			1
the @entity16 has been given an exclusive first look at some of the incredible alchemist - style experiments the institution has planned to stun audiences			1
going off with a bang : dr @entity23 igniting gun cotton in front of a live audience at the @entity2 as part of this year 's @entity28 ' when medieval alchemists staged spectacular stunts in front of royalty they never revealed the secrets of their mystical potions and fire - breathing creations , ' the @entity2 says			1
' today ’s chemists can perform equally impressive feats , but they do so to explain and explore the extreme frontiers of our material world			1
' three experiments will show how chemical reactions can have dramatic consequences , with explosions , jets of flame , and stone crumbling amid clouds of steam			1
stunned audiences will watch as researchers make apparently solid stone blocks melt with just a watering can , detonate volatile nitrogen triiodide , and throw caution to the wind as they tip water onto an oil fire			1
video of these experiments , too dangerous to carry out in front of a studio audience , has been provided to @entity16 to give our readers an exclusive first look			1
apparatus : dr @entity23 will play the role of @entity8 to show how dramatic chemical reactions can teach us about the world around us illuminating : dr @entity23 burns @entity72 in air			1
the name @entity75 was derived from the @entity77 ‘ phosphoros ’ meaning bringer of light this year 's lectures will be given by dr @entity23 , a @entity81 in the @entity82 , @entity83 and a @entity84			1
he will give three talks on three of the @entity77 ' elements ' - air , water and earth - to explain the chemistry of the world around us			1
the @entity16 has had a preview of some of the experiments that dr @entity23 has demonstrated - and we can assure readers there will also be plenty of fire to complete the set			1
‘ it 's such an honour to be selected to give the 2012 @entity28 , ' dr @entity23 said			1
' i first became interested in chemistry at the age of eight with my first chemistry set			2
' the spark that first ignited my interest has never faded , the only difference now is my chemistry set is much bigger			2
' i look forward to sharing my work and love for chemistry with the audience at home and in the @entity2 's famous theatre			1
' dr @entity23 burns magnesium in carbon dioxide , producing a bright white light hot ticket for an electrifying show : dr @entity23 channels close to 1 million volts from a @entity122 coil , combining nitrogen and oxygen from the air			1
right , he ignites a christmas tree made from gun cotton some of the topics dr @entity23 will tackle include the chemicals in favourite coffee shop 's festive blend , whether you are worth your weight in gold , and whether your house could be devastated by an ice bomb			1
the @entity28 are the @entity2 ’s biggest and most famous , demonstration based science events for young people			1
broadcast on television every @entity141 , they have formed part of the festive tradition for generations – often compared to the @entity141 message and the carols from @entity147			2
the lectures were begun by @entity149 in 1825 , a time when organised education for young people was scarce			2
he presented 19 series himself , establishing an exciting new way of presenting science			2
since then they have continued annually , stopping only during the @entity156			2
the first of the @entity2 's lectures will be broadcast on wednesday , december 26 , and will tackle the chemistry of air - the mixture of highly reactive and incredibly stable gases inside all our lungs			1
oxygen is the most reactive constituent			2
when we eat it ’s these @entity170 molecules that seize electrons from our food to give our bodies the energy to live , the @entity2 says			2
add a third oxygen atom and we make ozone , a gas so reactive that it ’s toxic if we breathe it in , but high up in the stratosphere this gas protects us from the sun ’s radiation			2
add a carbon atom and we produce carbon dioxide , a greenhouse gas responsible for warming the planet			2
the lecture will unravel the puzzle of how and why these compounds of oxygen hold the key to the viability of life on the planet			2
nitrogen , the most common element in air , is an unreactive gas , but a key atom in every cell in every living thing on @entity13			2
how can we imitate nature to bring this suffocating gas alive ? even less reactive are the @entity206 or inert gases			2
they ’re so stable they are the only elements that exist naturally as individual atoms – but what is it about them that make them so inert ? and how can we excite these gases enough to join the chemical party ? we ’ve come a long way from the days when alchemists thought air was a single element			2
the second of the lectures , to be broadcast thursday , december 27 , will investigate water - essential to life since every reaction in our bodies takes place in it			0
but what makes this fluid so special ? what happens when you add a lighted splint to a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen ? kaboom ! but why ? what makes this particular rearrangement of atoms to form water so explosive ? can we tap this energy release to provide environmentally friendly solution to our energy problems ? plants have the ability to reverse this reaction by using the energy from sunlight to release oxygen from water			0
we are starting to learn how to do the same			0
in this lecture dr @entity23 will unpack how energy lies at the heart of chemistry			1
we ’ll also look at the salts contained in water			0
once again we will see the startling difference between a compound and its constituent elements			0
take sodium chloride – aka table salt			0
sodium is a soft silvery metal that explodes with water ; chlorine a deadly poisonous , choking green gas			0
both elements are lethal to us , but after they have met , a dramatic change takes place			1
the sodium and chloride ions that form are essential components in our bodies			0
they help generate the electrical impulses that make our brains and nerves work			0
the rocks that form planet earth have always fascinated alchemists , and they will be the topic of the final @entity281 , which will be broadcast on friday , december 28			1
deep in the bowels of the @entity13 they thought the metals literally grew in the rocks and that one metal over time matured into another			0
they dreamed of replicating these natural processes turning ‘ base metals ’ into gold			0
today the extraction of minerals and metals from rocks has made fortunes , but not quite in the way the alchemists imagined			0
we now know many rocks are the result of oxygen combining with different elements – each with individual properties			0
breaking the strong bonds between oxygen and these elements has always been a challenge			0
@entity310 learned how to release copper in the @entity312 , and iron in the @entity314 , through smelting			0
now we can extract even more exotic materials			0
by understanding the properties of materials , such as the silicon present in computers , or the rare earth magnets generating our electricity in wind turbines , we are entering a new era of chemistry in which we can engineer electrons in new configurations for future technologies			0
we can now put together the unique cluster of protons , neutrons and electrons that form each of the 80 elements in exciting new ways			0
if the ancient alchemists were alive today they ’d be dazzled by the wonders created by the @entity8			1
many world - famous scientists have given them , including @entity343 winners @entity341 and @entity344 , sir @entity345 , @entity346 , lord @entity347 and dame @entity348			0
the @entity28 have been broadcast on television since 1966 , first on the @entity350 and then on @entity351 , @entity352 and more4			1
in 2010 , the @entity28 returned to @entity354 and in 2011 the combined broadcast reached over 4million viewers			1
the @entity2 will also this year broadcast online its own chemistry @entity358 calendar , featuring famous faces as they talk about their favourite elements from the periodic table			1
each day a short film reveals a different person – from @entity365 and @entity366 to @entity367 – answering the simple question ‘ what ’s your favourite element ? ’			0
by opening the calendar ’s doors you can find out which of the participants remembers dropping lithium and sodium into water , who ’s a fan of life - sustaining choices like carbon and oxygen and view enlightening and entertaining films each day			0
' the @entity2 hopes that the calendar and the lectures inspire the next generation of chemists : people who are fascinated by the way that elements combine to make up the world around us , ' a spokesman said			0
' even if you just watch the films it will prove to be a much more enriching experience than a small , ultimately unsatisfying piece of chocolate ( and have a less detrimental impact on your waistline ! )			0
' this year ’s @entity28 will be running on the 26 , 27 and 28 december on @entity354			1
they will be available to view on the @entity2 's own video channel after they are broadcast			1
1 ) contact explosive : detonating nitrogen triiodide to illustrate a point in the @entity405 , the @entity2 have used a very sensitive , but very powerful explosive , which detonates with the slightest touch			0
when it detonates it releases a beautiful plume of purple smoke and a very ( ! ) loud bang			0
2 ) water on an oil fire in lecture two , we see why you should never use water to put out an oil fire			0
even a small amount of water added to this small beaker of oil that has caught fire causes a huge jet of flame			0
3 ) disintegrating quicklime blocks for the final lecture , we see how water from a watering can dissolve apparently solid rock / @entity429 ( treated limescale blocks ) reacts with water to form calcium hydroxide , releasing clouds of steam into the air .			0

the topic for this year 's @entity28 is the @entity8
@entity83 chemist dr @entity23 will show off dramatic reactions
@entity16 has first look at some of the incredible experiments
