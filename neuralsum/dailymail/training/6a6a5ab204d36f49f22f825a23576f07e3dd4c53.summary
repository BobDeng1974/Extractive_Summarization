@entity0 have cleared @entity1 and @entity2 to fly out to @entity3 , despite the two @entity5 players limping off during saturday ’s @entity7 final			1
head coach @entity8 and his assistants watched the match at their @entity12 hotel and would have been alarmed by the sight of their leading fly - half and no 8 struggling with injuries			2
however , following urgent assessments , the pair were deemed fit to join the squad ahead of the three - @entity21 series against the @entity3			1
@entity1 was withdrawn from the fray in some discomfort after kicking the ball into the crowd to celebrate scoring a try which was subsequently ruled out			1
@entity2 was limping and holding his ankle before being replaced , but @entity8 played down the double scare			1
down : @entity1 injured himself after kicking the ball away in celebration of a try that was disallowed ‘ we left a medical team in @entity34 , ’ he said			1
‘ they assessed the players and everyone has come through unscathed , give or take bumps and bruises			0
it was cramp for @entity2 rather than anything more serious			1
@entity1 was cramp as well			2
’ the build - up to the tour has been blighted by injury setbacks and the fixture clash which means those players who took part in the @entity7 final can not be considered for the first test			1
as the series approaches , the condition of several players remains a worry			2
‘ @entity60 will be fine to train , ’ said @entity8 , in reference to the @entity58 prop who was nursing a hip injury			0
‘ @entity61 picked up a bit of an ankle injury			0
@entity64 still has n’t trained fully			0
we ’ll see how he progresses			0
i would n’t say he ’s doubtful yet , but the clock is ticking			0
’ on the plane : @entity2 has been cleared to join up with the @entity0 squad in @entity3 the front row has been an area of particular concern to the coaches , who will be without their first - choice props , @entity74 and @entity75 , against @entity3			1
many of the obvious understudies have been sidelined too and @entity8 added : ‘ @entity78 has had surgery , so is out of the tour			0
@entity82 ’s knee is good and he will train			0
‘ @entity83 got on at around 60 minutes in the final and played the extra-time as well			2
he seemed to come through fine and he ’ll be on the plane			0
’ the opening clash with the world champions at @entity90 is shaping up as a major examination of @entity0 ’s resources below the first - choice xv , as so many of those men will be unavailable			1
defeat : an understrength @entity95 side were beaten by the @entity96 at @entity97 on sunday but after naming a powerful 31 - man squad featuring recalled back - rowers @entity99 and @entity101 , @entity3 coach @entity102 warned @entity0 pose a serious threat			1
‘ they have been the most improved side in world rugby in the last two years , ’ he said			0
‘ those who think @entity0 will be fielding a weak side in the first @entity21 are completely underestimating the depth in the @entity0 squad			2
they have a very strong belief that they can win this series			0
‘ having said that , so do the @entity3			2
