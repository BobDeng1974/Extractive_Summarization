@entity0 eased past @entity1 in their opening game of the @entity3 but their match on monday evening is at the opposite end of the scale			1
the @entity7 face the might of @entity9 , a formidable challenge at any level of international football			1
manager @entity13 insists they are not in @entity15 to make up the numbers , and @entity17 takes a look at who could be lining up for both sides			0
@entity0 ( probable , 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) @entity21 age 21 , goalkeeper , @entity24 ( previously at @entity25 , loan spells at @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 ) , @entity30 4 , @entity31 19 , @entity0 caps 1			1
the high - rated keeper has been tipped as @entity0 ’s future no 1 ever since he made his @entity25 debut in 2010 but , after a move to @entity24 in 2013 , has yet to establish himself in the full squad despite making a senior appearance against			1
that 's mine ! @entity21 is set to keep goal for @entity41 against @entity9 on monday night @entity42 age 21 , right - back , @entity43 ( loan spells at @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 ) , @entity30 1 , @entity49 0 , @entity31 0 , @entity44 0			1
the nephew of @entity43 chairman @entity53 , @entity42 is a versatile defender who can operate at centre - back or full - back			2
he was a key member of the 2010 @entity58 @entity57 - winning side			2
@entity59 age 21 , @entity61 , @entity62 ( loan spells at @entity64 and @entity65 ) , @entity30 1 , @entity49 0 , @entity31 4 , @entity44 0			0
this has been a real breakthrough year for @entity59 as the commanding centre - back established himself in the championship - winning @entity62 side , making 30 appearances			2
looks every bit a future full international			2
@entity72 age 21 , @entity61 , @entity76 ( loan spells at @entity62 , @entity74 , @entity75 ) , @entity30 0 , @entity49 0 , @entity31 3 , @entity44 3			0
switched allegiance from the @entity78 to @entity0 and the @entity76 product impressed on loan at @entity75 this season before @entity82 placed him on the bench against @entity85 in the last game of the season			1
measured : @entity72 has impressed both at centre - half and right - back in recent seasons @entity91 age 21 , @entity61 , @entity93 ( loan spells at @entity27 , @entity95 ) , @entity30 3 , @entity96 0 , @entity31 1 , @entity44 0			0
part of the 2010 @entity58 @entity57 winning side , the @entity93 left - back has only made two first team appearances for the club , with @entity102 keeping him out of the side			2
@entity104 ( c ) age 19 , @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity30 5 , @entity49 0 , @entity31 7 , @entity44 2			1
yet another player to come from @entity107 ’s conveyor belt of youth talent , @entity108 has already made 49 first team appearances and is a key member of the @entity107 ’ side , as well as being @entity13 ’s trusted skipper			1
captain fantastic : @entity107 midfielder @entity104 is expected to skipper the side @entity118 age 19 , @entity106 , @entity119 ( loan spells at @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity43 ) , @entity30 0 , @entity49 0 , @entity31 18 , @entity44 1			1
an extremely versatile and hard - working midfielder , @entity124 has lots of energy and uses his size and athleticism to dominate midfield			0
a player very much in the @entity132 mould			2
@entity133 age 20 , @entity106 , @entity134 ( previously at @entity25 ) , @entity30 0 , @entity49 0 , @entity31 10 , @entity44 5			0
@entity133 seems to have been around for an age			0
he is lightning quick and extremely dangerous on the counter			0
could be crucial to @entity0 ’s success on monday night			1
@entity139 age 21 , attacking midfielder , @entity119 ( loan spells at @entity143 , @entity43 , @entity121 , @entity144 ) , @entity30 1 , @entity49 0 , @entity31 13 , @entity44 1			1
he really has not lived up to the early hype at @entity119 , yet @entity139 dictates the tempo of @entity0 ’s play with his short , sharp passing			1
tricky : winger @entity133 really impressed for @entity134 in the @entity151 last season @entity152 age 20 , @entity106 , @entity154 ( loan spells at @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 ) , @entity30 1 , @entity49 1 , @entity31 0 , @entity44 0			0
scored a debut goal in the 3 - 0 win over @entity1 to continue a fantastic year for the youngster after he was named @entity154 ’s player of the season			0
can operate at left - wing or left - back and is supposedly interesting @entity165			0
@entity168 age 20 , striker , @entity170 ( loan spells at @entity172 , @entity65 , @entity173 ) , @entity30 5 , @entity96 0 , @entity31 5 , @entity44 6			0
the @entity170 forward scored the winner at @entity176 earlier in the season and , although not prolific , he is a good finisher and he will be tasked with scoring @entity0 ’s goals on monday night			1
@entity9 ( probable , 4 - 5 - 1 ) @entity180 age 18 , goalkeeper , @entity183 5 , @entity184 1 , @entity185 ( played in @entity3 tournament twice ) the @entity188 goalkeeper has yet to make a first - team appearance for his club side but is highly - rated within the @entity192 national set - up			1
@entity193 age 21 , right - back , @entity30 2 , @entity196 ( on loan from @entity198 ) a tough - tackling right back who has enjoyed spells at @entity196 and @entity198			0
will have to deal with the raw pace of @entity152 and @entity133 on @entity0 ’s flanks			1
driving forward : twenty - one - year - old @entity193 is strong in the tackle and helps @entity9 in attack @entity207 age 20 , @entity61 , @entity30 14 , @entity209 1 , @entity210 already has a full international cap and is one of the hottest prospects in @entity214 – which is exactly why @entity210 forked out a staggering £ 25.4m to sign him from @entity216 last summer , and why @entity217 are trying to prize him away from the @entity15 capital			1
@entity220 ( c ) age 19 , @entity61 , @entity30 8 , @entity209 1 , @entity198 @entity9 ’s captain forms a commanding centre - back partnership with @entity207			1
has been linked with @entity119 in the past and is considered to be the next @entity224			2
@entity225 age 20 , @entity61 , @entity30 2 , @entity227 yet another @entity192 import into @entity214 , the left - back signed a five - year contract at @entity227 in february			0
has bags of energy and loves to get forward whenever he can			0
@entity234 age 20 , defensive midfielder , @entity30 2 , @entity235 normally a centre - back , @entity238 operates at defensive midfield for the national side			0
has won plaudits for his discipline and his man - marking abilities			0
hot property : @entity247 has had trials at @entity76 and a tricky customer in midfield @entity247 age 19 , midfielder , @entity30 3 , @entity235 an attacking midfielder who had trials at @entity76 before opting to stay in his native @entity9 , he is quick and extremely skilful on the ball			1
will punish @entity0 if they give him time and space			2
@entity257 age 21 , @entity106 , @entity30 3 , @entity184 1 , @entity209 1 , @entity259 @entity257 is used to leading from the front at @entity259 , but has slotted into the midfield for @entity9 in @entity3 so far			2
the attacking winger even scored when @entity263 handed him his full international debut in a friendly against @entity266			0
@entity267 age 20 , @entity106 , @entity268 7 , @entity183 15 , @entity30 2 , @entity119 the attacking midfielder spent last season on loan at @entity271 from @entity119 , having made just one league appearance under @entity273 in the 8 - 0 win over @entity275			1
the 20 - year - old can play in various attacking roles , and is likely to sit behind @entity278			0
familiar : @entity267 - who was on loan at @entity271 in @entity280 - will be nothing new to @entity119 fans @entity283 age 20 , attacking midfielder , @entity31 5 , @entity30 3 , @entity183 3 , @entity284 ( not to be confused with @entity287 ) @entity283 has the ability to create something from nothing , and @entity284 ’s attacking midfielder should line up as partner to @entity267			1
the 20 - year - old spent time on loan at @entity295 in 2013 so knows striker @entity278 well			0
not to be confused with @entity9 ’s defensive midfielder @entity287			2
@entity278 age 19 , striker , @entity30 2 , @entity295 @entity278 can physically impose himself on his opponents , and is unlike the usual slick forwards @entity9 are known for			2
he scored the first in the win over @entity305 and should lead from the front again .			0

@entity104 expected to skipper the side
@entity119 's @entity267 could prove a tricky customer from @entity9
keeper @entity21 only @entity0 player in expected xi with a full cap
three of @entity9 possible starting xi have been capped at senior level
