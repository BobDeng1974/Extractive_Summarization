@entity1 ’s spring / summer 2015 collection for @entity2 caused an insta - stampede , nearly breaking the internet when he sent human @entity5 dolls down the catwalk			1
the creative head , who is famed for making kitsch cool , sent his models down the runway in @entity11 in @entity5 doll inspired dresses to the sound of @entity16 's iconic 90s hit , i 'm a @entity18			1
as the ultimate dictator of trends , it seems that we may all be wearing bright pink leathers and super girly dresses this season			2
but does the look work in real life ? and will you garner attention for the right reasons ? weighed down by eyelashes , @entity31 , 30 , a journalist at @entity32 , decided to find out by taking to the streets of @entity35 dressed like the iconic doll			1
weighed down by eyelashes , @entity31 took to the streets ( and supermarkets ) of @entity35 dressed as the iconic doll i ’m like a vampire barbie ; i only come out at night			1
daylight hours , on the other hand , are a very different story , with me championing a pretty consistent , low - fi uniform of skinny jeans , biker jackets and a scruffy bun			1
my nocturnal counterpart , however , stands in almost unrecognisable contrast ; her heels are high and her hair even higher			2
so although donning @entity1 ’s @entity5 - inspired @entity2 collection was n’t as much of an almighty leap for me as it would be for , say , the rest of the world , it still required a certain amount of chutzpah to take it to the streets			1
still , i located my audacity and got out there to see exactly how the looks would translate to real life			2
it only took one @entity75 search to reveal exactly how popular @entity5 still is - but a far more entertaining barometer was watching the office ’s reaction when a giant box from @entity2 arrived at my desk			1
with the same fervour usually reserved for a @entity83 delivery , i was suddenly surrounded by a cluster of excited , giggling women on the edge			2
@entity31 explained that literally everyone smiled at her			1
doors opened for her , small animals and children stared , she got a hand with her shopping and a wink with her @entity94 @entity31 wore the spray - on leather skirt suit to do the weekly shop			1
navigating the supermarket aisles , she admits she felt like a saucy @entity98 everyone had a story to share – from the doll they had in the 1980s wearing the exact same dress , to the toy dreamhouse they used to play in with their sister			1
that powerful sense of nostalgia , and that unifying , almost categorical common ground , is something not many things could manage			2
@entity2 seems to have achieved it to the next level , creating a collection overflowing with universal happy memories			1
indeed , @entity1 said of the collection : ' i approach everything with so much humour			2
' and as gimmicky as some naysayers may have accused it of being , i now have first - hand experience of its mood - enhancing capabilities – for me , and for literally everyone who had my very pink person cross their path			1
for a start , it turns previously mute colleagues into your new best friend in the office bathroom			2
people you have literally never laid eyes on before want to have a good old chinwag , all - pink leather acting as some kind of conversational lubricant			1
everyone , and i mean everyone , smiles			2
small animals and children stare			2
you get a hand with your shopping and a wink with your @entity94			1
and when you post a selfie onto @entity153 you get 93 likes and 28 comments and it makes you feel a little bit important			0
at the end of the day , she changed into the piece de résistance ; a very short , very wide and very sequinned mini dress and made her way to meet a blissfully unaware friend			0
' what in the name of @entity165 are you wearing ? you look like a cake ! do n’t stand so close to me , ' he said you also get people who you have n’t heard from in three years sending you dubious private messages , but that ’s a small price to pay for becoming a social media sensation for three and a half minutes			1
such is the power of pink , people			1
practicality , then , becomes almost superfluous			0
it might be a glorious 30 - degree desert day , but i ’ll be damned if i ’m not going to wear my spray - on leather skirt suit to do the weekly shop			1
navigating the supermarket aisles , i felt like a saucy @entity98			1
a cupcake tray ended up in my basket			0
i did , on the other hand , get unwittingly , and worryingly , into character			0
i forgot a pair of my louboutins in the toilets after changing outfits			0
i , when wearing an enormous puffball dress , tried to answer my office phone whilst standing and ricocheted off my desk			0
and when being photographed having a meeting in @entity198 , i shoved a fake macaron in my mouth after being told in no uncertain terms that it was display only			0
walking through the streets , the looks were plentiful but surreptitious			0
bar a few spectators who stopped to take pictures ( thank - you for restoring my faith in shamelessness – i was briefly convinced that everyone had been castrated by manners ) , people would stare , but only when they thought i could n’t see			1
also : not one person sang @entity16 ’s @entity18 at me			0
i mean , come on			0
frankly , i was disappointed at the lack of clichés			0
' it might be obvious , brash even - but it fits our current filtered , @entity221 - existence perfectly - there 's no denying the collection looks great in a picture , ' she said of the experience it raised that age - old question of whether you dress for yourself or others , as however cheerful my ensemble made me , i still felt the small need for validation from others			1
it ’s kind of the sartorial equivalent of if a tree falls in the forest and there ’s no one around to hear it			0
if you ’re outrageously attired and no one bats an eyelid , it kind of takes the fun out of it , no ? ' @entity249 , this is @entity35 , ' a straight - shooting friend told me after i had a little moan about it on the ( vanity mirror ) phone			1
' @entity255 is expected , remember ? ' satisfied with this , i changed into the piece de résistance ; a very short , very wide and very sequinned mini dress straight outta 1983 , and made my merry way to @entity35 to meet a blissfully unaware friend			0
' what in the name of @entity165 are you wearing ? you look like a cake ! do n’t stand so close to me , ' he said			2
i ’m falling at the last hurdle so decide to rapidly explain myself			0
' i ’m doing a road test ! ' i shout over the music			0
' a protest ? what the hell are you protesting against ? ! rational clothing ? ' well , two out of three workable outfits ai n’t bad			0
i drag my mortified friend to @entity275 and then back to change into my civvies which , i wo n’t lie , now seem really sad in comparison			0
if @entity1 has tapped into anything , it ’s unadulterated whimsy			0
it might be obvious , brash even - but it fits our current filtered , @entity221 - existence perfectly - there ’s no denying the collection looks great in a picture			2
a very wise person once told me life was too short to wear boring clothes			0
and as long as @entity1 ’s around , there ’s really not much danger of that			0
after completing the challenge , pictured , she changed back into her normal clothes , which she says felt ' sad in comparison '			0

@entity31 , 30 , *rocked* head - to - *toe* @entity2
went to the supermarket and an art event - and got lots of attention
people stared , helped her with her shopping and said she looked like a cake
