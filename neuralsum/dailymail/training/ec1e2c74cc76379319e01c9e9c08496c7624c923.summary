@entity0 runs you through what we learned from the weekend 's football ... @entity6 was one of two @entity8 players to run faster than 20mph during the @entity10 ' defeat by @entity11 , @entity5 is closing in on 100 career yellow cards while @entity14 has looks to have changed his style at @entity16			1
@entity18 ’s top priority in the transfer market will be to inject pace into @entity8 ’s team			2
apart from @entity25 all the @entity23 sides who played on saturday had a player who produced a swifter sprint than @entity29 ’s top speed of 20.7mph			2
top speed : @entity6 was one of two @entity8 players to get over 20mph against @entity11 at @entity32 the only other @entity8 player to get above 20mph in the @entity35 ratings was defender @entity6 - not all that encouraging when you think the 3 - 5 - 2 system that @entity18 has brought from the @entity38 relied on the searing sprints of @entity40			1
his fastest sprint was recorded at more than 22mph			0
@entity5 looks stitched on to become the @entity23 ’s all - time most booked player , and the first to reach a century , by the end of this season – if not sooner			1
the former @entity46 midfielder was lucky not to get sent off for a clumsy challenge on @entity49 ’s @entity48 a few minutes after getting carded for blocking @entity50			2
the yellow he did get was the 95th of his career , now just two behind @entity55 and four off joint record holders @entity57 and @entity58			0
in the book : @entity60 midfielder @entity5 ( left ) is close to picking up a century of yellow cards 3			1
@entity62 has spent the last four years of his career at either left back or on the left of midfield but @entity66 manager @entity65 found a new job for him at @entity68			1
the 29 - year - old played just behind the centre forward , and not only blotted @entity71 out of the game but set up a chance that @entity74 should have put away			2
@entity62 has n’t played in a central role since he first moved from @entity8 to @entity76 – when @entity65 ’s new no 2 @entity77 was the boss			1
middle man : @entity62 played just behind the centre forward for @entity66 against @entity68 4			1
@entity14 is under instructions to deliver a less direct style of play at @entity16 and he ’s clearly following orders – despite the disappointment of losing to @entity86			1
hammers attempted 483 passes against @entity86 , 150 more than they did in the same fixture at @entity90 last season			2
their average number of passes per game last term was just 325			0
following orders : @entity14 's @entity16 attempted 483 passes against @entity86 on saturday 5			1
@entity98 continues to be linked with @entity86 and made little secret of his desire to follow former @entity102 boss @entity101 to @entity103			1
but the @entity106 midfielder ’s performance at @entity107 made sure that , in the meantime , he could n’t be accused of failing to give his all to @entity102			1
@entity98 ran 7.7 miles in the game , more than half a mile more than any other player involved at @entity111			1
going the extra mile : @entity102 midfielder @entity98 ran further than any other player during @entity102 's defeat at @entity111 6			1
@entity115 was @entity116 ’s key defender away from home last season and it does n’t look as if this year will be too much different			0
the @entity120 skipper made a series of blocks and tackles to help @entity116 keep a clean sheet at @entity125 as around him @entity126 and @entity127 did n’t always look comfortable			0
@entity116 will worry that a hangover from the @entity38 gives @entity115 no fitness issues			0
last season they took just four points from five away games he missed , compared with 30 from the 14 in which he played			0
brave : captain @entity115 dives in to deny @entity125 frontman @entity138 at @entity139 @entity140 happy to escape with three points 7			0
@entity142 could be a bargain replacement for £ 11million @entity144 at @entity145 after marking his debut following a £ 450,000 move from @entity102 with the winner against @entity149			2
@entity142 could feel hard done by for never getting a chance at @entity102 despite scoring nine in 11 starts after a £ 1.8m move from @entity153 in 2012			1
the 28 - year - old still scored an average of a goal every three games in loan spells at @entity159 , @entity160 and back at @entity153 and his career record remains a goal in every two starts			2
easy does it : @entity142 slides the ball home to give @entity145 a 1 - 0 victory over @entity149 at @entity169 8			2
when @entity172 took @entity160 into the @entity23 for the first time in 2006 the club ’s chairman sir @entity170 insisted that a large chunk of the tv cash was invested in building the club ’s @entity177 facilities			0
eight years later the decision is paying dividends			0
@entity181 , who got the winner against @entity183 , was one of 12 players in manager @entity185 ’ 18 - man squad who have come through the system			0
striker @entity189 has been struggling to reach agreement over a new contract at @entity192 despite top scoring last year with 24 goals			0
with a year to go on his current deal , and other clubs monitoring the situation , he did his case for a pay rise no harm by scoring twice in the 4 - 0 victory at @entity201			0
that already takes him to three goals in two @entity205 matches , as his agent will no doubt be pointing out to @entity208 chairman @entity207			0
earning his money : @entity189 ( right ) celebrates after scoring during @entity192 's 4 - 0 win over @entity201 10			1
@entity213 ’s @entity212 players need to learn that the game lasts longer than 90 minutes these days			0
@entity217 ’ injury time free kick that snatched a point for @entity219 was the third time in as many games in a week that @entity212 had thrown away a game by conceding late on .			0

@entity6 one of only two @entity8 player to run faster than 20mph during 2 - 1 defeat to @entity11
@entity60 midfielder @entity5 closes in on century of bookings
@entity62 *deployed* behind striker for @entity66 's win over @entity68
@entity14 had @entity16 playing less direct football against @entity86
@entity98 put in the hard yards for @entity102 at @entity111
