‘ my consultant said that in her 30 years as a gynaecologist she had never seen a natural reversal in anyone diagnosed with premature menopause as a teenager , ’ @entity16 said			1
the first signs that she might be recovering came in 2012 when she experienced some bleeding			2
miss @entity2 was told she had undergone early menopause but then went on to give birth early menopause is rare in younger women , affecting around one in 1,000 under 30s			1
it occurs when the ovaries fail , which can be caused by genetic problems or infections such as mumps or malaria			2

dr @entity88 , patron of the @entity89 , a support group for women having premature menopause , said : ‘ although women are informed that [ the condition ] is irreversible , occasionally there can be recovery of ovarian functioning due to some eggs still being present in the ovaries			2
this can lead to periods restarting and even pregnancy			0
‘ it is because of cases such as this we have recommended that the condition should be renamed @entity107			0
‘ there is some evidence that @entity50 might help and we offer our patients the option of short ‘ hormone holidays ’ as a test of whether their ovaries are showing any signs of recovery			0
