but behind his back , his ' trusted ' finance chief @entity16 was fleecing his bank account in 20 electronic raids after being given the ' keys to the safe '			1
she was jailed at @entity20 for two and a half years for her ' cunning and devious ' thefts			1
leading @entity11 @entity2 , whose former employee @entity16 was jailed after admitting five charges the court heard how @entity16 was given her position within @entity2 's @entity4 - based empire - but then plundered tens of thousands of pounds from behind mr @entity2 's back in a slick crime spree			1
@entity16 , from @entity29 , @entity4 , helped herself to the cash in a series of more than 20 ' electronic ' raids on one of her boss ' many accounts			1
she chose the account deliberately because she knew it was the only one not checked by an outside auditor			2
and after spiriting the money away , @entity16 created a smokescreen of false entries to cover her tracks			1
jailing her for two - and - a - half years , judge @entity43 told her : ' you were so greedy you may have surprised yourself with the amount you took			2
' you were a highly valued employee effectively running the finances , and in part , the private life of the victim and his family			2
' he was a multi-millionaire who you decided to soak			0
' he added : ' moreover , he was a public figure and my guess is you took a gamble that if you were found out it would all somehow be smoothed over			0
' i have now seen how capable you are of being cunning and devious			0
' @entity2 was appointed a cbe in the 2012 @entity57 for political and charitable services - and made headlines in 2011 by moving into the house used for the @entity62 programme			1
@entity16 , a mother - of - two , told police she was innocent when she was arrested in april last year , and then she lied from the witness box during an aborted trial earlier this year , the court heard			1
but only as a new trial was about to begin did @entity16 finally admit five charges of theft , totalling £ 97,347 , between august 2008 and july 2009			1
judge @entity71 said : ' you sought to bluster your way out of this			0
' you gave lying evidence and you cast aspersions on an employer who had been nothing but kind and supportive of you			0
' even after the ' gross ' deceit he suffered at her hands , mr @entity2 ' bears no malice ' , the court heard			1
and references , including one in person from another successful businessman , showed a different side to her character			0
@entity91 , mitigating said : ' she was a woman of good character			0
' clearly that has been shattered and given this conviction her further employment prospects have been devastated as well			0
' she knows she made a dreadful mistake			0
she is extremely remorseful and it is clear she is absolutely petrified at the prospect of custody			0
' investigators will now seek to recover any of @entity16 available assets under a @entity105 application .			2
