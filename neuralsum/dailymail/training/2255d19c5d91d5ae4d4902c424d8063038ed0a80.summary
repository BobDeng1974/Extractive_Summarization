by @entity0 published : 08:28 est , 15 may 2012 updated : 09:13 est , 15 may 2012 a new piece of stencilled graffiti , possibly by @entity3 , has appeared overnight on the wall of a @entity6 shop in @entity7			1
it shows a young @entity10 boy hunched over a sewing machine with real @entity16 bunting attached - and given the artist 's controversial past works , it could be a dark reflection on the imminent @entity17 or the @entity19 celebrations			1
however , as the pictures below show , someone later removed the bunting , which had been attached high across the wall			1
residents near @entity26 in @entity27 , north @entity7 , noticed the artwork this morning on the side of the nearby bargain store - which sells similar bunting - and has itself been at the centre of controversy			1

the child , known as @entity59 , was reportedly earning just 7p a hour to make napkin rings for the cut - price chain			2
the company severed ties with the supplier and issued a statement saying it ' did not tolerate child labour under any circumstances '			2
all @entity3 works can be found on his official website but , as this is not yet the case with the latest piece , it is unknown whether the artist created it			1
the artist , who has amassed a fortune selling his work at auction , appeared to have secretly painted the wall in the early hours of yesterday morning with the help of two collaborators			1
@entity83 , 14 , who lives on the road , told the @entity85 : ' i came down here at about four in the morning and there were three guys who looked homeless with their backs to the wall			2
in july 2010 , @entity6 launched an inquiry into the ' @entity49 sweatshop ' claims concerning @entity59			1
the boy was found to be working and sleeping in the factory in @entity97			2
his ‘ wages ’ of under £ 7 a week were sent to his widowed mother in a poverty - stricken rural village hundreds of miles away in the east ­ ern state of @entity102			0
the cheap trinkets he decorated were bought by @entity106 , a @entity97 company which supplied the cut - price chain			0
the bargain store was founded by @entity111 @entity110 and @entity112 in 1990 , but was sold in may 2010 to @entity114 private equity firm @entity113 for £ 200million			0
@entity6 has more than 250 outlets across @entity111 , and employs about 7,000 people			1
the company confirmed at the time that it had placed orders with @entity106 , but said it was a new sup ­ plier and they had not yet received any of the goods			0
‘ @entity6 does not tolerate child labour under any circum ­ stances and will not work with companies that employ children , ’ a spokesman said			1
' they must have been painting it on the wall somehow because i came back past at six o’clock and it was there in the exact same spot			2
' excited locals gathered round to take photos of the artwork , which could b e worth thousands of pounds			2
@entity138 , 16 , who lives nearby , told the paper : ' it ’s inspiring to see graffiti on the streets of @entity7 which is actually good art and not vandalism			0
' @entity144 , 42 , who works in new media , said : ' it ’s a work of art , so of course i enjoy it			0
it will probably put house prices up in the area – that ’s what has happened in areas where he has been before			0
' i do n’t see why anyone should object - all it means is the area has arrived			0
he is n’t attacking the area , he is attacking businesses in the area which exploit people in sweatshops			0
' @entity3 is promoting an issue by painting this but i do n’t think a lot of people will know what it means – they might think it is just any graffiti			1
' in the past , graffiti by the elusive artist has caused house prices to skyrocket			0
in 2008 , a @entity175 wall adorned with his name fetched £ 200,000 on @entity178			2
his work is known for its strident anti-establishment message , which has done nothing to damage his popularity among celebrities and the super-rich – his 2010 film @entity181 was nominated for an @entity188			0
@entity3 ’s famous work includes a vandalised phone box crumpled in half with a pickaxe in its side			1
he once climbed into the penguin enclosure at @entity195 and painted ' we ’re bored of fish ' in 7ft high letters			0
at the 2004 @entity200 , the prankster handed out spoof @entity111 £ 10 notes substituting the picture of the @entity205 ’s head with @entity206 , princess of wales head and changing the text ' @entity207 ' to ' @entity3 of @entity209 '			1
the mystery of @entity3 the prankster @entity3 is perhaps the most famous , or infamous , artist alive			1
to some a genius , to others a vandal			0
always controversial , he inspires admiration and provokes outrage in equal measure			0
since making his name with his trademark art in public spaces - on walls in @entity7 , @entity223 , @entity224 and even on the @entity226 barrier separating @entity227 and @entity228 - his works have sold for hundreds of thousands of pounds			0
@entity205 ( left ) , worth £ 7,950 ; and another simian piece by the artist a saucy stencil of a lover caught with his trousers down on the side of a building in @entity237 in @entity238 he is also known for his headline - making stunts , such as leaving an inflatable doll dressed as a @entity243 prisoner in @entity244 , @entity245 , and hanging a version of the @entity247 - but with a smiley face - in the @entity249 , @entity250			0
and as the value of his work rocketed – @entity253 and @entity254 are collectors – an urban myth emerged that @entity3 was a talented tearaway from an underprivileged background on an inner - city estate			1
for years , he dumbfounded the art world by keeping his identity a secret			2
but four years ago @entity263 is believed to have finally unmasked @entity3 as @entity264 , a former public schoolboy who grew up in middle - class suburbia			1
according to a source close to the artist , mr @entity264 , understood to be 37 , ' lives [ with his wife ] in an isolated community '			0
