the @entity20 last night slumped to their lowest - ever poll rating in the wake of the sexual harassment allegations against their former chief executive @entity24			0
a @entity26 survey for @entity27 put the party on just eight per cent , in fourth place behind @entity5 for the first time			2
however , a separate survey by former @entity6 deputy chairman @entity32 suggested that in the @entity34 seat of @entity2 , where voters go the polls on thursday , the @entity20 are clinging on to a five - point lead over their coalition partners			1
the @entity2 by - election , triggered by the resignation from @entity40 of the disgraced former cabinet minister @entity41 , has become a high - stakes battle for @entity44 and mr @entity9			1
defeat to the @entity7 in what has been a traditional stronghold would be a shattering blow for the deputy prime minister and mark the first time a prime minister has taken a seat in a by - election since @entity53 in her @entity52 pomp in 1982			0
while a @entity26 poll shows the @entity20 down to just 8 per cent nationally , a separate survey by @entity32 puts the party five points ahead in the @entity2 by - election but mr @entity44 will face questions about his own chances of securing a majority in 2015 if the @entity6 fail to take the constituency against the backdrop of mr @entity41 ’s resignation and the deepening scandal over the allegations against @entity24			2
mrs @entity1 , who was @entity66 for the south - east region and the party ’s only female representative in @entity70 , said she had been persuaded to join the @entity7 by mr @entity44 ’s pledge of an @entity73 referendum last month			2

‘ the fact that @entity75 ducked - out of fighting the @entity2 by - election made it crystal clear to me that @entity5 just is n’t serious about offering real leadership , ’ she said			2
‘ it was a golden opportunity to try and return an mp to @entity92 and he shirked it			0
selecting a relative nobody underlined what i had started to fear for some time : that @entity5 is a pressure group with no real political ambitions or aspirations			0
‘ in this context i have to ask what do you get if you vote @entity5 ? we have a perfect answer this week in the @entity2 by - election			1
‘ only two parties have a real chance of winning in @entity2 - the @entity20 , and the @entity6			2
that ’s the party that wants to take us into the @entity11 or the party that wants to give us an in / out referendum			0
‘ @entity5 can not win , but it could still affect the result - @entity5 votes could help the @entity110 get in			0
a vote for @entity5 in @entity2 is simply a vote to give @entity9 another @entity19 mp			1
that is the cold reality of a @entity5 vote			1
’ mrs @entity1 said the @entity6 candidate in @entity2 , @entity115 , was a ‘ eurosceptic like me ’ who ‘ really cares about her community ’			1
‘ she will stand square behind @entity44 in fighting for a better deal for @entity122 in @entity123			0
she is the candidate for a party with serious plans to cap immigration			0
we need her and more of her calibre in @entity92 , ’ she added			0
lord @entity32 ’s poll in @entity2 suggests @entity5 could indeed cost the @entity7 the seat - putting them on 21 per cent , with the @entity7 on 28 per cent and the @entity20 on 33 per cent			2
in the running : mrs @entity1 said the @entity6 candidate in @entity2 , @entity115 ( pictured centre with @entity134 mayor @entity133 last week ) , was a ' eurosceptic like me ' who ' really cares about her community ' it found that mr @entity44 and chancellor @entity139 retain a clear lead over @entity141 and @entity142 when it comes to trust on the economy , but the @entity20 are well ahead of the other parties on ‘ understanding the @entity2 constituency and representing local people in parliament ’			1
two thirds of voters in the constituency - including two thirds of @entity20 - are either satisfied with mr @entity44 ’s performance as prime minister or would prefer him to mr @entity141			0
' @entity5 can not win , but it could still affect the result - @entity5 votes could help the @entity110 get in			0
a vote for @entity5 in @entity2 is simply a vote to give @entity9 another @entity19 mp			1
