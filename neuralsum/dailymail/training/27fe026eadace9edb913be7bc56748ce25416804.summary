by @entity0 , @entity1 caretaker @entity2 admits the new @entity5 manager could quickly opt to dismantle the team built by former boss @entity7			1
the @entity5 were stunned on thursday night by the abrupt exit of the man who had guided them to @entity12 safety last season , with @entity7 reportedly unhappy with the way the south @entity16 club had done their transfer business in the summer			1
@entity2 took temporary charge against @entity19 , just as he had done when @entity20 left last year , but could not gain a positive result as @entity5 were beaten 2 - 1 at the @entity22 by a stoppage - time goal from @entity24			1
@entity26 words : @entity2 has warned @entity5 's current crop of stars that they could be shipped out @entity29 : @entity5 were beaten by a late goal from @entity19 's @entity24 at the @entity22 @entity31 lauds late @entity24 goal @entity5 co-chairman @entity33 indicated the board are looking for someone with experience of the @entity38 top flight , with former @entity40 boss @entity39 and @entity42 manager @entity41 thought to be the leading candidates			1
@entity2 will hold further talks with the board on monday , but understands all too well what a complete change in football philosophy could bring			1
he said : ' this is the problem with changing managers			2
you bring in players to suit the system you play and if you are bringing in a different manager with different philosophies , then maybe they wo n't suit that			1
' with the window shutting at the end of this month , the appointment is important so they have a little bit of time to bring in new players			2
' @entity65 decision : co-chairman @entity33 is expected to appoint a successor to @entity7 later this week favourites : @entity41 ( left ) and @entity39 ( right ) are leading the race to replace @entity7 whatever happens , @entity2 believes a quick resolution is needed for everyone to look forwards			1
' the players will want to know on monday which direction the club is going			2
there is a good group there , but they do need leadership , ' he said			2
' whoever comes in , it needs to be pretty quick			2
the longer you leave it then it can start drifting			0
' we do n't want to be like that and get off to a poor start like last season			0
' @entity2 , who served his apprenticeship as a young player at @entity5 in the 1980s , hopes he will be considered for the job full - time			1
' the circumstances are different now			0
i felt then ( last season ) that the situation was n't right for me , ' the 47 - year - old former @entity95 boss said			0
' i know i can manage - i have done it before			0
i want to speak to the chairman and see which direction he wants to go in			0
' if he has got belief in me , i will speak to him where we want to go with it			0
' if he says to me that he 's definitely bringing someone else in you get on with it			0
hopefully i will be a part of it , so we will just have to wait and see			0
