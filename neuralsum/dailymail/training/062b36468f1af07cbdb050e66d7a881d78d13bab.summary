by @entity1 reporter published : 04:28 est , 28 november 2013 @entity3 : 05:45 est , 28 november 2013 the @entity4 is based on the fasts of the @entity7 prophet @entity6 there are diets that involve substituting food for air and others that see slimmers consume alcohol instead of a meal			1
now , there is also the so - called @entity18 diet			0
officially known as the @entity4 , the diet sees people eat nothing but fruit , vegetables and whole grains			1
followers only drink water and avoid eating meat , fish , bread and any sweetened or processed foods			1
the eating plan is based on that followed by the @entity7 prophet , @entity6			1
it is fasting in the sense that followers cut back , rather than stop eating food altogether - in a similar vein to the the 5:2 plan ( where followers eat a restricted diet two days a week )			1
@entity42 , author of the @entity4 , explained that the plan is based on his recorded fasting experiences			1
in a video , she explains that @entity6 was among a group of men captured by @entity48 and that @entity49 of @entity48 wanted the men to be in top condition - so insisted they eat the same food as he ate			1
but when @entity6 was served this food , he refused it , as he was committed to @entity18 and felt the food had not been prepared according to @entity56 standards			2
he also believed it had been sacrificed to false gods			0
@entity59 states : ' but @entity6 purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king 's meat , nor with the wine which he drank			1
' instead , ms @entity42 says , he vowed to eat nothing but foods grown from seeds and drink only water			2
later , @entity6 fasted again while seeking @entity18 's word on the future of @entity72 and described this fast as involving no meat , wine or leavened bread			1
@entity77 states : ' i ate no delicacies , no meat or wine entered my mouth , nor did i anoint myself at all , for the full three weeks			0
' these biblical descriptions of @entity85 € ™ s fasts form the basis of the new eating plan			2
ms @entity42 , who described the @entity4 as a ' vegan diet with even more restrictions ' , says following the diet involves avoiding caffeine , chemicals and sugar and , as a result , it can ease headaches , leg cramps and fatigue			1
she added it can also cause people 's cholesterol levels to fall and their blood sugar levels to balance out			0
the author adds that the diet often leads to weight loss and ' a general feeling of wellbeing '			0
however she adds that , while the diet is a very healthy way to eat , people with health problems might need to modify it			2
it sees people eat nothing other than fruit , vegetables and whole grains			1
followers also drink nothing other than water and avoid sweetened and processed foods for example , she accepts that people with diabetes might need to eat more carbohydrates and that pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers might need to add fish , chicken and cheese			1
@entity132 , from @entity133 , tried the @entity4 as a religious exercise and without considering the weight loss that could go with it			2
she told the @entity137 that she initially struggled with it when eating in restaurants or with friends			0
however , she says she lost weight while on the diet and she still has a healthier diet as a result			0
' since the experience i 've lost a lot of weight just from learning how to have more self - control , ' she said			0
but nutritionist @entity149 is unconvinced by the health benefits of following the diet			0
she explained to @entity152 that the health impacts it would depend on how long someone follows it for			0
nutritionists say there are some benefits to the diet as it sees people cut out junk food , white flour , sugar and processed foods			2
however , they also say it could lead to shortages in many vital vitamins she said that if they only follow it for a few days , it would not cause too many problems			1
but longer than that could cause them to become deficient in numerous vitamins - especially those found in animal products			1
she said the diet is good in the sense that it involves cutting out junk food , sugar , white flour and processed foods			2
this reduces the chance of obesity and lowers a person 's risk of some cancers , heart disease and diabetes			0
but , she added that followers would miss out on @entity193 , @entity194 , @entity195 and @entity196			0
a lack of @entity193 can , in extreme cases , lead to blindness , a shortage of @entity194 can cause muscle weakness and bone pain and a deficiency of @entity195 could cause the immune system to be weakened			1
she explained that , as a result , anyone following the diet for longer than a few days would need to take vitamin supplements to avoid health problems			2
