by @entity0 @entity1 has been relaxing in @entity2 this week before meeting up with the @entity4 squad ahead of the @entity5			1
the @entity7 striker was named in @entity9 's 23 - man squad for the tournament in @entity11 and will be crucial if they are to progress into the latter stages			2
and the 24 - year - old , who finished his club season on sunday , chose to have a break in @entity17 with his girlfriend - despite @entity4 flying over to @entity2 to play two friendlies in just over a fortnight 's time			1
' if i ’m not careful , i will be treating all the players like children and telling them what they can and ca n’t do in their spare time , ' @entity9 said in february			2
' but i certainly would n’t encourage them to go that far away , no. ' my advice will be if you are going to go away with your family , keep it much closer to home and avoid the very , very long journeys			0
' but whether or not i go as far as to say " if you ’ve booked a holiday to @entity49 , then you can forget a place in my 23 " , i ’m not sure i ’ll go that far			0
' @entity4 face @entity51 and @entity53 over in @entity2 on june 4 and 7 respectively before flying to @entity54			1
@entity1 was also captured watching @entity56 's 96 - 94 win against the @entity57			0
watching brief : @entity1 was close to the action as @entity56 beat the @entity57 96 - 94 i pity the fool ! @entity1 was wearing almost as many gold chains as mr @entity61 during his jaunt abroad			0

@entity1 is on holiday with his girlfriend in @entity17
@entity9 had hoped that @entity4 players would n't travel far for a break
three @entity70 are over in @entity2 for two friendlies next month
