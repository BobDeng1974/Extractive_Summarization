@entity0 have made no move to register goalkeeper @entity2 with the @entity3 this week , effectively ruling him out of saturday ’s game at @entity5			1
@entity0 are in the grip of a deepening injury crisis with midfielders @entity8 and @entity10 and goalkeeper @entity11 returning from the international break with injuries			1
@entity15 ’s finger dislocation makes him a doubt for the weekend – although that has n’t been confirmed yet – and there has been speculation that @entity0 manager @entity20 may overlook regular no 2 @entity21 at the @entity22 this weekend and try and push the experienced former @entity24 keeper @entity2 in to emergency service			1
@entity0 goalkeeper @entity11 leaves @entity28 training on friday to get a dislocated finger looked at the 32 - year - old is a free agent and has been training at @entity0 while he recovers from a knee injury			1
@entity2 is close to fitness now but @entity0 would have to officially add him to their @entity3 squad in order for him to play and it is understood that has not happened			1
there is room in @entity0 ’s official list for @entity2 as they are not currently up to their 25 - man maximum permitted by the league			2
however , an application to add the 32 - year - old would take a number of days and the fact @entity0 have not even started the process would appear to suggest @entity21 will play this weekend if @entity15 is not fit			2
@entity2 ( centre ) watches from the stands as @entity0 draw 1 - 1 with @entity50 at @entity51 @entity52 goalkeeper @entity21 ( second left ) looks set to start against @entity5 on saturday @entity2 was in @entity53 as @entity24 beat @entity54 in the @entity55 in february this year as regards @entity15 , the @entity56 1 sat on the bench as @entity28 beat @entity58 over the weekend , rather than being sent home to his club as would usually be the case when a player is seriously injured			1
the 24 - year - old - who has been linked with a move to @entity65 - told the @entity67 press that @entity2 is not being signed as a replacement for him			2
' yes , my contract runs out in 2016			0
but they did n't sign him for that , ' @entity15 told @entity67 newspaper as			0
' @entity2 had a difficult injury , he had a bad time and the boss knows him well and has given him the opportunity to recover			2
@entity15 - seen here celebrating with @entity78 after @entity0 beat @entity79 - has been in fine form this season @entity81 dislocates finger ' yes , @entity2 is training over in @entity53 , he 's still not 100 per cent after his injury			1
when he is fully fit he will start to train with us			0
he 's still not training in goal with us			0
from time to time he comes out with the goalkeeping coach but very little still			0
' @entity88 knows him well because he gave @entity89 his debut at @entity24 and has a special affection for him and whenever possible we have to help where we can			0
' football is cruel at times , it 's difficult			0
when things go well you 're very good and when they go badly , well it 's awful			0

goalkeeper @entity2 has been training with @entity0
the former @entity24 ace is close to recovering from a serious knee injury
@entity0 will register the @entity28 international in their squad
but they will not do so in time for @entity2 to face @entity5 on saturday
regular no 1 @entity11 likely to miss the game with a dislocated finger
@entity114 's @entity113 has *argued* that the @entity5 vs @entity0 fixture should be *postponed* *due* to injuries
