tests revealed that cells appeared biologically older in people who were severely depressed or who had suffered from the condition in the past			0
@entity4 researchers compared cell structures called telomeres in more than 2,400 people with and without depression			1
telomeres bracket the ends of chromosomes to protect cell 's dna being damaged , but they are shortened when cells divide and can indicate ageing			1
on average people naturally lose between 14 to 20 base pairs of @entity25 in the telomeres each year , @entity29 reported			2
telomeres of people who had ever suffered depression were significantly shorter by about 83 to 84 base pairs of dna , than those of people who had never suffered from the condition			1
scientists said the difference indicates approximately four to six years of advanced ageing			0
the differences in a measure of cell ageing called telomere length could n't be explained by other harmful lifestyle factors , such as alcohol or smoking , the @entity43 reported			2
the differences in a measure of cell ageing called telomere length could n't be explained by other harmful lifestyle factors study author @entity55 from the @entity56 , in the @entity4 , and @entity58 colleagues , found that the most severely and chronically depressed patients had the shortest telomeres			1
the results were published in @entity62			0
the findings come after a new study has shown that not only can light activity treat depression , it can actually prevent it			0
researchers looking at 26 - years ' worth of data have shown that people who exercise when they 're young are less likely to become depressed as they get older			2
the project , which analysed data from 30 previous studies , found that in 25 of them there was a link between lack of activity and being diagnosed with depression in later life			0
the study , published in the @entity80 , recommends around 20 - 30 minutes of light activity , such as walking or gardening , every day .			0
