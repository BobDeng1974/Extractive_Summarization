a third of children are now officially considered overweight , worrying figures have revealed			1
the crisis is at its worst among those aged 11 to 15 , with almost four in ten at risk from damaging levels of fat			1
a 20 - year study of electronic health records lays bare the problem among children in @entity12			1
it shows the numbers classed as overweight or obese jumped by about 8 per cent a year in the late 1990s			1
but experts warned there was no room for complacency and extra efforts must be made to rescue the ‘ lost generation ’ of overweight teenagers			1
the figures are particularly concerning as obese children have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes and heart disease in later life			1
they are also more likely to experience bullying , low self - esteem and depression			0
obesity costs the @entity45 £ 5billion a year			0
researchers from @entity17 used the anonymised electronic health care records of more than 370,500 children aged two to 15 between 1993 and 2013			0
they found the number who were overweight or obese increased by around 8 per cent a year during the first decade of the study			2
but between 2004 and 2013 rates slowed substantially to 0.4 per cent a year , suggesting the growth in obesity may have levelled off			0
the group most affected were those aged 11 to 15 , with 38 per cent of boys in this age range found to be overweight or obese in 2013			1
the pattern is similar among girls , says an online report in the @entity62			0
among both sexes and all age groups , the proportion of children judged too heavy was around a third in 2013			0
the researchers said the fact obesity rates had stabilised suggested public health campaigns may be starting to work			0
but other experts are concerned that strategies to deal with child obesity are not proving effective			0
these include the government ’s flagship ‘ responsibility deal ’ , under which food and drinks manufacturers set their own targets for cutting sugar and fat			2
professor @entity82 , of @entity83 , said telling children to eat less and exercise did nothing to address the amount of time they spent looking at computer , television or smartphone screens			0
@entity93 , of the @entity94 , said : ‘ the real problem is among children aged 11 to 15 who are really getting fatter			1
’ he added that efforts should be made to reduce the number of women who start off their pregnancies overweight and obese			1
‘ this starts the whole cycle in children , ’ he said			2
‘ fat women produce fat babies who are at greater risk of many health problems from the beginning of life			2
’ dr @entity111 , chairman of the nutrition committee of the @entity113 , said young teenagers ‘ are likely to be easily influenced by the world around them , through advertising and access to pocket money - priced fast food ’			2
he added : ‘ the result – heavier children mean higher rates of serious obesity - related health conditions like type 2 diabetes			0
' if we are to make inroads we need to create a healthy environment by ensuring that children are not exposed to junk food advertising before the 9pm watershed , licences for fast food restaurants are not granted to restaurants close to schools or colleges , a taxation on foods high in salt , sugar and fat is explored and young people are taught how to cook healthy meals in school much earlier			0
’ @entity12 ’s @entity145 said : ‘ overall childhood obesity rates have remained stable since 2010			1
' however , for children from the poorest households , levels have continued to worsen , so there is no room for complacency			0
’ professor @entity82 , a paediatrician and diabetes specialist , said : ‘ the childhood obesity crisis in @entity12 is far from over and our current weapons in the war against fat seem unlikely to provide the answer			1

almost four in ten 11 to 15 - year - olds at risk from damaging levels of fat
new figures reveal that a third of children in @entity12 are now overweight
experts say effort must be made to rescue ‘ lost generation ’ of obese teens
