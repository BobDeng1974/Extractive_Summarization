it could be worth up to $ 2million , make 2,875 sandwiches , and has been hailed a ' @entity2 ' ... but @entity3 wants to stuff her record - breaking tuna catch and hang it on her wall			1
the game fisherwoman battled for more than four hours the 411.6kg ( 64 stone ) @entity8 bluefin before finally reeling in the high - speed leviathan - thought to be the largest ever caught with a rod and line			1
she hooked the fish - which is twice the size of a tuna sold at a @entity17 auction last year for $ 1.09million - using a 60lb line near the @entity19 off @entity20 of @entity21			1
' the line was peeling out like it was attached to a freight train , ' said @entity3 , of @entity32 , @entity21			1
' as usual , i was pretty nervous that i might get spooled			0
thankfully , the fish stopped running and i was able to get a bit of line back in			0
' unaware of the scale of her catch , @entity3 and her four - strong team battled for over four hours to drag the gargantuan 8ft 9 ' tuna onto her boat			1
' it was a very stubborn fish , but i 'm stubborn as well , ' said @entity3			1
huge haul : after the 4 hour and 11 minute long battle , the fish was lifted on to the boat , with the help of the anchor winch big surprise : at 411.6kg , the fish weighs twice as much as a baby elephant and could fill 3162 cans of tuna ' the wind had got up to gusts of 36 knots and i was getting drenched from the waves coming over the back of the boat			1
' but i was determined to win this one			0
i knew we had to get the tuna on board before a shark came and bit a chunk out of it			0
weight : 411.6kg length : 8ft 9ins edible meat ( once filleted ) : 230kg approximate wholesale value : $ 13,200 ( £ 8,000 ) approximate retail value : $ 83,000 ( £ 50,000 ) potential auction value : $ 2million ( £ 1.2million ) number of tins of tuna ( 160g , drained ) : 1,769 dishes of tuna sashimi : 511 tuna sandwiches : 2,875 ' we were all speculating what it was			2
no way did i think it was a tuna			0
' after the 4 hour and 11 minute long battle , the fish was lifted on to the boat , with the help of the anchor winch			2
she said : ' once we got it on board , everybody 's mouth dropped open			0
' i was so excited that my arms and legs could have fallen off and i would n't have noticed			0
i think adrenalin is a great thing and it certainly kept me going			0
' at 411.6kg , the fish weighs twice as much as a baby elephant and could fill 3162 cans of tuna			1
it blows the current world record for a fish caught on a rod of 335kg out of the water			2
@entity113 , chairman of @entity114 , the largest online fish retailer in @entity116 , told @entity117 : ' the wholesale value of a bluefin tuna that size would be in the realm of $ 8,300 ( £ 5,000 ) to $ 16,500 ( £ 10,000 ) - that 's about four times the value of an ordinary tuna			1
the retail value , of course , would be much higher - somewhere around $ 83,000 ( £ 50,000 ) or more			0
' last year , however , a 222kg bluefin tuna sold for $ 1.09 million at a @entity129 auction			0
by that standard , @entity3 's fish could be worth up to $ 2 million at auction			1
titanic tussle : unaware of the scale of her catch , @entity3 and her four - strong team battled for over four hours to drag the gargantuan 8ft 9 ' tuna onto her boat storm brewing : the rough seas made landing the leviathan even tougher ' people would be willing to pay a lot for a record - breaking fish , ' added mr @entity113			1
' if you have got a bit of that fish to serve at your banquet then you 've got something pretty boast - worthy			0
' so this would appeal only to people who are billionaires			0
it 's the fish equivalent of buying a @entity156 painting			2
' he added that a whole bluefin tuna contains around 55 per cent of edible meat			0
that means it could make 1,769 tins of tuna ( 160g , brine drained ) , 2,875 tuna sandwiches or 511 dishes of tuna sashimi			0
@entity3 , however , is unable to sell it because the fish was n't caught on a commercial vessel			1
instead , she plans to have it mounted by a taxidermist at the @entity173 in @entity21			1
world record : @entity3 is now awaiting certification from the @entity176 so she can claim the world record built for speed : @entity178 are the world 's largest tuna and can live for up to 40 years			1
built for speed , they can dive up to 4,000 feet and have retractable fins so they can seek out schools of herring , mackerel and eels @entity3 explained : ' we were originally going to have it smoked and shared around our friends , but then we were talked out of this as it was so monumental			2
' usually a fish is either stuffed with filler material like firmly packed sawdust or it is stretched over a mold and shaped into the desired pose			2
@entity3 has chosen to make a mold , but the pose , she says , is yet to be decided			2
the enormous catch put @entity3 in first place in the tuna section for the @entity21 @entity202			1
she is now awaiting certification from the @entity176 so she can claim the world record			2
