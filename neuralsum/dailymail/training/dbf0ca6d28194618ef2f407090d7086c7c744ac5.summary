by @entity0 published : 11:24 est , 27 february 2014 @entity2 : 12:42 est , 27 february 2014 @entity4 's new music video has been edited to remove a pendant which read ' @entity6 ' after an outraged @entity8 man launched a petition			1
@entity10 , from @entity11 , claimed the video ' promoted blasphemy ' as it showed the necklace being disintegrated along with the man wearing it , and asked @entity17 to take it down			1
while the clip has not been removed , it has been edited to remove the necklace after the petition attracted 65,000 signatures in three days			1
however it has now been removed ( right ) after an outraged @entity8 man set up a petition in the video @entity32 plays an @entity35 princess looking for a suitor but disintegrates each one when they displease her the first man , who is wearing the @entity6 pendant , presents @entity32 with a giant diamond but is disintegrated however it is not clear whether it was @entity17 or @entity32 's record label which removed the offending item			1
calls from @entity47 to the record label have not been returned			0
compared to raunchy videos by the likes of @entity52 and @entity53 , @entity32 's offering could have been considered tame , if it were n't for the @entity28 symbol for @entity6 around the man 's neck			1
in his complaint , mr @entity10 said : ' the video is considered as highly controversial to its viewers as a result of its portrayal of blasphemy			2
' @entity64 is clearly conveyed in the video , since @entity4 ( who appears to be representing an opposition of @entity67 ) engulfs the believer and the word @entity67 in flames			2
' this is the reason for lodging the petition so that people from different walks of life , different religions and from different parts of the world , agree that the video promotes blasphemy			2
the petition claimed that the video ' promotes blasphemy ' and urges people from around the world to sign , arguing that no religion would tolerate the name @entity67 being used in a ' disrespectful manner ' the petition collected 65,000 signatures from countries including @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92 ' using the name of @entity67 in an irrelevant and distasteful manner would be considered inappropriate by any religion ' the video currently has more than 38million views though has more than 100,000 ' dislikes ' and several negative comments mentioning the pendant			0
after signing the petition , @entity101 , from @entity102 , said : ' absolutely disgusted at the music industry for allowing this to happen , music should be about spreading love not hate			0
it 's shameful that you allow stupidity , you need to look up the meaning of the word explicit			0
' fellow signatory @entity112 , from @entity114 , @entity115 , added : ' this video is really offensive to [ the ] @entity8 faith ! ' @entity25 is @entity32 's third single off her new album ' @entity121 ' and features @entity124 rapper @entity122 the hip - hop infused pop song is currently sitting at number one on the @entity124 @entity129 list			1
the international pop star released the music video on february 20 on her official @entity133 page to her more than 50 million followers			0
it currently has almost 30 million views .			0
