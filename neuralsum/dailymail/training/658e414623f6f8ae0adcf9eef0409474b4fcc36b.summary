straight talk : @entity13 ( left ) has given his crying sister @entity20 ( right ) some practical advice in a funny new video ' i did n't ! ' she responds , sobbing			1

' @entity20 remains unimpressed with @entity13 's advice , grabbing his arm while insisting : ' no , i do n't ! ' important question : ' did you have a nap today ?
