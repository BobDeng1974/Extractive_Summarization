@entity1 was named @entity10 on sunday night in recognition of his astonishing 30 @entity13 goals this season , which have helped catapult @entity2 into the title race			1
the award caps a remarkable turnaround for the striker , who was banned for 10 games at the end of the last campaign after biting @entity5 defender @entity23			2
however , having missed the first six matches of this season , @entity1 returned to the @entity2 side at the end of september and formed an incredible partnership with @entity30 - the pair have hit 50 @entity13 goals so far			1
well - deserved : @entity2 striker @entity1 scooped the @entity10 award on sunday night all smiles : @entity1 poses with @entity5 's @entity4 who scooped the award for @entity3 danger man : @entity1 celebrates the latest of his 30 @entity13 goals for @entity2 this season upset : the @entity37 did n't have the best of times against @entity40 's @entity5 on sunday afternoon @entity1 , who played as @entity2 lost 2 - 0 to @entity5 at @entity41 hours before the ceremony , said : ' the @entity13 is full of really great players and so it is a great honour when these players recognise your work on the pitch			1
' i always try my best for the team and it is nice to get awards but really this is for my team - mates and the staff at @entity2 because without their help i would n't have this prize			0
' @entity5 forward @entity4 , who scooped the @entity60 award , came second in the main vote , while @entity63 talisman @entity62 came third			1
@entity1 , who becomes the first @entity2 player to win the award since @entity66 in 2006 , was the overwhelming favourite for the top award			2
the @entity37 has put behind him a troublesome year which saw him agitating for a move in the summer , even at one stage claiming manager @entity71 had reneged on a deal to allow him to leave for a @entity74 club			0
man in form : @entity1 has been in breathtaking form in front of goal all season long for the @entity80 bang in form : @entity1 has somehow managed to net a staggering 30 goals for the @entity13 title chasers @entity83 : @entity84 ( @entity5 ) @entity85 : @entity86 ( @entity87 ) @entity88 : @entity89 ( @entity63 ) @entity88 : @entity90 ( @entity5 ) lb : @entity91 ( @entity92 ) @entity93 : @entity94 ( @entity92 ) @entity88 : @entity66 ( @entity2 ) @entity88 : @entity62 ( @entity63 ) @entity88 : @entity4 ( @entity5 ) @entity95 : @entity1 ( @entity2 ) @entity95 : @entity30 ( @entity2 ) @entity71 ' handling of the situation has been impressive but the @entity2 boss insisted all of the credit should be with the player			1
' he is a brilliant talent			0
i think the supporters have seen him mature over the course of the last season , ' @entity71 said of @entity1 on friday			2
' i think he was in a real low moment after that game ( against @entity5 last year ) but he has gone away and probably looked in the mirror and reflected on himself because he is not that type of guy and it probably just spilled over			2
' he is a really intelligent man who fits the values of this club , which is all about humility , class and he has all of that			0
' he is a sheer winner and that probably overspilled last year but his development over the last year has been remarkable both on and off the field and @entity2 have benefited from that			0
' for me he is the consistently outstanding player over the course of the last year			0
' trouble : @entity1 was banned for eight games after @entity124 claimed he was racially abused by the striker 2013 april 21 - bites @entity23 on the arm but escapes punishment on the pitch as the referee fails to see it , and scores @entity2 's equaliser seven minutes into stoppage time as they draw 2 - 2 with @entity5 at @entity41			1

december 15 - @entity151 twice in @entity2 's emphatic 5 - 0 victory over @entity153 at @entity154			0
december 20 - after scoring 17 goals since his return , signs a new long - term contract with the @entity80			0
december 29 - @entity40 accuses @entity1 of ' doing an acrobatic swimming pool jump to try get a penalty ' during @entity2 's 2 - 1 defeat to @entity5 at @entity161			1
2014 february 16 - powerless to prevent @entity2 exiting the @entity162 in fifth round defeat to @entity140			0
march 30 - scores in the @entity80 ' 4 - 0 humiliation of @entity153 at @entity41			0
the win sees @entity2 move to the top of the @entity13 table			2
back of the net : @entity1 fired @entity2 to the top of the @entity13 as he scored against @entity153 april 18 - nominated alongside @entity2 team - mates @entity66 and @entity30 for @entity10 award			1
april 20 - becomes the first @entity2 player since @entity174 to score 30 goals in a @entity13 season			1
goal comes in @entity2 's 3 - 2 victory over @entity179 at @entity180 , a result which sends his side five points clear at the top of the league			0
april 27 - hours after @entity2 suffer a painful @entity13 defeat by @entity5 , @entity1 is named winner of the @entity10 award			1
close : @entity2 captain @entity66 , whose mistake proved costly against @entity5 , was on the shortlist knows where the net is : @entity30 has scored 20 goals for @entity71 ' side this year @entity1 , who has terrorised @entity13 defences all season , topped a six - man shortlist which also included his strike partner @entity30 , @entity2 captain @entity66 , @entity62 , @entity4 and @entity92 midfielder @entity94			1
rather amusingly , @entity1 walked into the room during comedian @entity201 's set before the award was announced			2
the funnyman appeared to let @entity1 off though , joking : ' are you confident @entity1 ? ' all six nominees were named in the @entity10 's @entity206 of the year , alongside @entity5 pair @entity84 and @entity90 , @entity63 captain @entity89 and full backs @entity86 and @entity91 of @entity87 and @entity92 respectively			1
however , having seen four players named in last year 's selection , not one @entity150 star made this year 's xi following a disastrous campaign which saw manager @entity213 lose his job last week			1
it 's the first time a @entity150 player has failed to make the @entity217 since 1990			1
meanwhile , @entity2 had more reason to celebrate as defender @entity7 won the women 's @entity10 prize while team - mate @entity9 scooped the @entity3 award			0
