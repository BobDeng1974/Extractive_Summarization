by @entity0 published : 04:29 est , 23 june 2013 updated : 16:53 est , 23 june 2013 @entity1 has attacked @entity3 legend @entity2 for criticising his appointment as the club ’s director of football , saying the former @entity10 striker ‘ has n’t got a clue about coaching ’			1
@entity2 , who failed to save @entity3 from relegation in 2009 as caretaker manager while @entity1 recovered from heart surgery , said last week the 66 - year - old ’s return has undermined manager @entity15 and turned the club into a ‘ laughing stock ’			1
@entity1 told @entity18 : ‘ what @entity2 says is diabolical			1
this is a guy who has n’t got a clue about coaching			2
defence : @entity3 's new director of football @entity1 came out swinging in a @entity18 interview ‘ the last game of the season , he came up with the master idea of playing @entity30 at left back			1
@entity30 is one of the best left wingers around but ca n’t tackle			0
and we went down with an own goal from @entity30			0
@entity2 keeps slagging me off			2
i ’m entitled to fight back			0
’ @entity1 has been ridiculed over a radio interview with @entity36 in which he mispronounced the names of players , referring to @entity39 as ‘ @entity40 ’			1
he claimed he had been duped into thinking he would be reminiscing with co-host @entity41 about their days at @entity43 rather than discussing @entity3 with presenter @entity44			1
rubbish : @entity1 labelled @entity2 's comments ' diabolical ' and said he ' has n't got a clue ' about coaching ‘ i did it as a favour and i ’m so disappointed , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ i was on air and he switched me to the other presenter			0
i thought i was going to speak to @entity41 about the old days			0
@entity40 is a brilliant player and i did n’t pronounce his name right			0
but i did n’t say “ kebab ”			2
i said “ @entity57 ” ; they put the ‘ b ’ on it			0
they made a meal of it , no pun intended			0
’ audio scroll down for @entity1 talking to @entity36 farce : @entity1 admitted mangling @entity39 's name but says he called him ' @entity66 ' not ' kebab ' stitched up ? @entity1 says he thought he was going to talk to @entity41 about the good old days owner @entity69 ’s decision to bring @entity1 back has put a question mark over @entity15 , but @entity1 said : ‘ i am not after his job			1
@entity2 knew there was a director of football coming in			1
he felt a little isolated ; @entity69 sussed that			0
‘ if things are going wrong at the club , i am accountable and he will be coming through me , not anybody else			0
‘ everybody thinks @entity15 is under pressure			2
’ natural progression : @entity1 said he has the experience for the job after playing and managing in some of the top stadiums in the world gone : @entity86 ( right ) walked out after @entity69 's appointment of @entity1			2

he labelled @entity2 's comments ' diabolical ' and said he ' has n't got a clue '
claimed @entity36 interview was a stitch - up and he did n't call @entity39 ' kebab '
*apologised* to @entity3 fans for saying he knew more about football than them
said he could be sacked and is under more pressure than @entity15
*insists* he is not after the manager 's job
defended his record for winning *trophies* and claimed the media are liars
