the @entity3 ruled that the scheme was lawful and rejected @entity2 ’s claim that the @entity14 had infringed her rights by forcing her to work for free at the discount store			1
miss @entity2 , 23 , had alleged that a scheme designed to encourage the long - term unemployed back to work had breached @entity19 of the @entity20 , which bans forced labour and slavery			1
but mr @entity23 said : ‘ characterising such a scheme as involving or being analogous to “ slavery ” or “ forced labour ” seems to me to be a long way from contemporary thinking			1
’ he added that the scheme was ‘ a very long way removed from the kind of colonial exploitation of labour that led to the formulation of @entity19 ’			0
miss @entity2 graduated from @entity34 with a degree in geology in june 2010 and began to claim jobseeker ’s allowance that august while volunteering at a local museum , @entity38 , in the hope of getting a job			1
but when she made a second claim for the unemployment benefit in july last year she was told she must undergo six weeks of training , effectively forcing her to abandon her voluntary work placement and her hopes of it leading to a career			2
when she told her @entity48 adviser she did not want to participate she was told it was ‘ mandatory ’ and that she risked losing her £ 53.45 - a - week jobseeker ’s allowance if she refused			0
miss @entity2 said she could not afford to lose her only source of income			2
she was sent for a week ’s training and then to the @entity5 store in @entity56 , @entity57			0
she was required to sweep floors and stack shelves for five hours a day , five days a week for no pay as part of her ‘ training ’ , it was claimed			0

’ legal challenge : @entity2 , pictured , was ' forced ' to leave her voluntary work at a museum to stack shelves at @entity5 or risk losing her benefits she believes the placement allowed @entity5 to use her and five other claimants as ‘ free labour ’ in the run - up to @entity78			1
at the @entity3 in @entity80 , the judge dismissed her claim for breach of human rights but said the @entity84 had broken jobseekers ’ regulations			2
she should not have been told it was mandatory to participate in the @entity88 , but once she agreed to take part her benefits were at risk , he said			0
miss @entity2 , who has since returned to her voluntary role at the museum , refused to comment on the judge ’s ruling			2
but work and pensions secretary @entity95 said : ‘ comparing our initiatives to slave labour is not only ridiculous but insulting to people facing real oppression			0
’ the programme was designed to help 250,000 young people gain skills through training and unpaid work experience in the public , private and charity sectors			0
but it attracted criticism when it emerged that the jobless were effectively working for free – or for expenses .			0

@entity2 said @entity14 programme breached @entity113 of the @entity20 , *prohibiting* slavery and forced labour
