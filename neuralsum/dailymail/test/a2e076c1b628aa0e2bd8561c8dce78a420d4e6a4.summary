it took @entity1 less than a minute of his weekly press conference to burst @entity4 's bubble and re-open some of the more troubling issues of his time in charge at @entity9			1
the @entity10 wasted no time in revealing that @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 will miss the much - anticipated clash with @entity16 at @entity17 through injury			1
four players capable of filling two key positions			1
' the worst scenario , ' @entity21 called it			0
@entity24 arrives in @entity25 ahead of the @entity16 clash while @entity27 ( right ) poses with a fan @entity4 captain @entity24 could be dropped further back into midfield against @entity16 @entity24 had been impressing for the @entity30 in his favoured striking role but @entity4 have players out @entity11 ( left ) limped off against @entity33 while @entity14 ( right ) picked up an injury too @entity12 ( left ) and @entity13 ( right ) are also out injured for @entity4 ahead of their game with @entity16 @entity4 midfielder @entity36 posts a picture on his official @entity38 of the squad 's journey to @entity25 @entity4 boss @entity1 ( left ) and assistant @entity41 ( right ) carry their luggage on friday @entity21 puts his arm around @entity24 during a training session earlier this week ahead of saturday 's game the uplifting victory in last weekend 's @entity48 derby has come at a price			1
all of a sudden , @entity4 's chances of extending an impressive run of six straight @entity52 wins by becoming the first top - flight team to win away at @entity16 this season look decidedly slimmer			1
@entity21 must take on his old apprentice @entity55 without either of his two first - choice holding midfielders , @entity11 and @entity57 , and two senior centre - backs in @entity13 and @entity14			1
@entity12 was hurt in the @entity48 derby by a challenge from @entity33 skipper @entity61			2
it means that captain @entity24 is likely to be asked to sacrifice himself for the team once again by dropping into midfield — an issue that both player and manager must have hoped was behind them			1
with @entity71 not ready to return from injury , that in turn raises the old question about whether @entity74 has the necessary match sharpness to replace @entity24 and lead @entity4 's attack having not started a game since february			1
@entity4 striker @entity71 has not yet been passed fit enough to return to first - team action there remain doubts over @entity74 's ability to fill the void in @entity4 's attack against @entity16 @entity84 is set to take over from @entity12 at left back despite fitness concerns that have plagued him since his £ 28million move from @entity88 last summer and led to him being hooked at half - time in the @entity91 defeat by @entity92 last month , not to be seen since			1
and then there 's the likely choice of replacement for @entity14 between @entity96 and @entity97 , two young defenders who have not featured since january and february respectively			2
both figured more prominently in the first half of the season when persistent injury problems and experimental formations slowed @entity21 's progress			0
we were back on familiar ground on friday , the fragility of @entity4 's squad all too apparent			2
was he concerned by the lack of playing time among the players he may turn to ? the @entity4 boss answered with one of his @entity10 sayings			1
' yes , but that 's also a truth like a cow , ' he said			0
' it means a rhetorical question			0
you know the answer already			0
' there is more balance in the team because i have played the same line - up more			0
@entity84 ( left ) looks set to return to the @entity4 first - team , while @entity24 will drop into midfield ' i did n't have injuries anymore and now , coincidentally , we have four in two positions where we do n't have any other players			1
' it 's the worst scenario because @entity14 and @entity13 are good players at the left central defender position			1
@entity138 is suspended so we do n't have many choices			0
' @entity84 has already had more than four or five weeks with no match and i do n't like that			0
but we train and i think he is fit enough			0
' @entity57 and @entity11 could play the midfield holding position and i do n't have any other option , or i have to play @entity24 in that position again			1
i have to puzzle a lot			0
' with @entity16 holding an eight - point lead and a game in hand over @entity4 , @entity21 is experienced enough to know that even victory is unlikely to make any difference in the title race			1
' it 's still possible , i 've said that before , but it is not logical , ' he added			0
' it 's more when and if , and i do n't believe in when and if			0
the fact is that we are behind @entity16			2
' but , all right , we have to play against them and so do @entity92 so we can lay pressure on @entity16 's shoulders			1
you never know , you 've seen it in previous @entity52 seasons			2
' they play at home but i think that @entity16 will be satisfied with a draw			1
' @entity4 midfielder @entity36 ( right ) gets ready to play a pass during a club training session on friday @entity21 , meanwhile , will be satisfied if @entity4 hold on to third place and fulfil his primary aim of qualification for the @entity174			2
but he made it clear that first place is ultimately all that matters and what drives him on at the age of 63 when financial security is no longer an issue			0
' we live for these titles , ' he said			0
' we are doing this for that			0
the only satisfaction you have as a manager is when you win a title			2
' when you are second or third you can play @entity174 , but a title is more fixed and you have your name on it			2
that 's why managers are fixated on titles			0
when you reach that goal you are happy			0
' to be involved in the game with young people to reach a goal , that is why i 'm still a manager because i do n't have to work any more — you can count on that			2

@entity4 are missing four players in key positions ahead of the *crucial* @entity52 game with title rivals @entity16 at @entity17
@entity12 , @entity11 , @entity13 and @entity14 are all out injured
@entity24 could be dropped *deeper* into midfield to compensate
the *decision* to play @entity24 in midfield has been an *unpopular* one before
