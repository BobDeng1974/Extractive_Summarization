by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity3 and @entity4 striker @entity2 looks poised to join his boyhood club @entity5 , who released him as a 15 - year - old			1
we asked @entity0 of fan website saintsweb whether the deal represents good business for the south coast club			0
is it any wonder that many clubs appear to not actually be trying to achieve genuine success when the end result is either bankruptcy ( in the case of our near neighbours @entity21 ) or a circling of vultures from the upper echelons of the league eager to stop you in your tracks and acquire the fruits of your own hard labour ? at the time of writing , of course , not a single player has yet been sold , but the writing appears very much on the wall , and a whole host of talent looks likely to be leaving @entity39 's this summer , along with manager @entity40			0
on the move : @entity3 striker @entity2 is on the brink of a £ 4million move to @entity5 @entity44 bound : @entity2 is currently training with @entity4 ahead of the @entity45 next month while the majority of the fans are disappointed with @entity40 's departure to @entity50 , we also realise that we held a broadly similar outlook when he first arrived on these shores			1
what i do n't think any of us were expecting , though , was such a feeding frenzy on the playing squad			0
as a club we have always tended to drive a hard bargain when pressured into selling players , even when @entity60 was chairman , and the one major sale under @entity63 's reign ( @entity64 to @entity65 ) was also a deal where everyone believed we 'd done pretty well			0
all of this is in stark contrast to what appears to be a done deal to take @entity2 back to where it all began at @entity5			1
@entity2 , along with @entity74 and @entity75 , represent the progress we have made as a club from being in the doldrums in @entity79 , and his departure may even hurt more than a home - grown talent like @entity74 leaving			1
he embodies all that is good about our club , and yet whoever is in charge of these decisions in the absence of a manager appears to have been played by one of the oldest negotiating tricks in the book , with the club now likely to be taken for a ride			0
@entity94 : @entity5 are still in talks with @entity3 for £ 30million - rated @entity74 gone : @entity40 left @entity3 to take charge at @entity39 's this week £ 4million plus add - ons ( what exactly are they ? ) for a 32 - year - old with no pace may seem like a good deal on the face of it , but he has been the figurehead of the system that has been so widely and rightly showered with praise over the course of this season , and i challenge anybody to find a player who can contribute 10 plus goals and 10 plus assists a season in the top flight for that amount of money			1
@entity5 have played our board like a fiddle with empty ultimatums to get the deal done before the @entity45			1
there is n't another player like @entity2 , @entity5 are n't suddenly going to run out of money or change their transfer approach over the space of a month , and yet we 've danced to their tune			2
danger man : @entity2 celebrates scoring against @entity130 with team - mate @entity131 all of that wonders who is actually making the decisions			2
the chairman stated barely 48 hours ago that no players would be bought or sold until a new manager was appointed , and yet either he or @entity138 , the only club director with any experience in the game , fell for @entity5 's game hook , line and sinker			2
somebody needs to let the fans know what 's going on			0
it even sounds like somebody needs to let the players know what 's going on as well ! while it 's never been plain sailing for @entity3 , i do n't think we 've ever shot ourselves in the foot to this degree before			2
it 's time for answers ... read more of @entity0 's opinions at @entity158 and on @entity159 @ @entity158			0
