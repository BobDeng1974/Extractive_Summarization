@entity0 , left , with @entity2 party leader @entity1 , right , before his defection to the @entity4 @entity1 was rocked last night as one of his @entity6 defected to the @entity4 , saying : ‘ @entity2 is pointless			1
’ in a major coup for @entity8 , @entity0 jumped ship less than a year after he was elected as a @entity10			1
but last night , @entity0 ’s decision descended into a tit - for - tat battle between the parties			2
just hours before news of his defection was due to be made public , @entity2 announced they were ‘ suspending ’ him pending investigations into ‘ extremely serious ’ allegations			1
@entity0 , a @entity19 - born businessman , has been one of the few non-white faces in the senior ranks of @entity2 and was used to rebut allegations of racism in the party			1
his defection comes four months after two conservative mps – @entity27 and @entity28 – quit to join @entity2			2
now @entity8 has turned the tables			0
it was one of several blows delivered to @entity1 ’s election hopes last night			0
first , a senior @entity2 official admitted the party was chasing the votes of ‘ bigots ’			2
party secretary @entity37 – who , ironically , was hired to stamp out negative media stories about @entity2 – said : ‘ people talk about @entity2 being bigots but there are hundreds of thousands of bigots in the @entity42 and they deserve representation			2
’ mr @entity37 admitted making the remarks , but defended them as ‘ the sort of chat people have with their mates while having a drink ’			0
then @entity50 learned that @entity2 ’s economic spokesman , @entity51 , told a meeting in @entity53 that right - wingers in @entity2 are ‘ away with the fairies ’ – and that many egos in the party were ‘ slightly out of control ’			1
the comments by the pair , both close to @entity1 , will be seized upon as proof that the party is dominated by extremists			0
but it is the row over @entity0 ’s switch that could prove the most damaging			0
@entity2 immediately went on the offensive against the @entity67 , making allegations of unanswered financial and employment questions , and interference with the candidate selection process			1
@entity0 dismissed the claims as ‘ a crude attempt to smear me ’			2
writing in @entity50 , he said : ‘ there is not a shred of truth in any of the claims but it has made me more convinced than ever that i made the right decision			0
’ mr @entity0 was suspended by @entity2 over unanswered financial employment questions , it emerged on saturday announcing his ‘ suspension ’ , @entity2 said : ‘ the @entity42 @entity2 has a zero - tolerance policy and takes the matters at hand extremely seriously			1
the allegations against mr @entity0 are of a grave nature and we will be forwarding our evidence obtained so far to the police			1
‘ @entity2 will not tolerate anyone abusing their positions in the party as we have a firm commitment to differing ourselves from the existing political classes			2
as a result , mr @entity0 ’s involvement with the party was suspended today with immediate effect pending further investigations			1
’ the news came after @entity0 said he was defecting as he agreed with @entity8 that a vote for @entity2 could put @entity103 in @entity104			1
@entity0 said @entity8 ’s promises on immigration and an in - out referendum on @entity42 ’s @entity109 membership meant there was no longer a need for @entity2 – and he suggested the party was essentially a platform for promoting @entity1 ’s personal ambitions			1
@entity0 , who has represented @entity115 and the @entity116 since last may , told @entity50 : ‘ i entered public life to campaign for a referendum on @entity119 and a controlled immigration system			1
mr @entity0 , pictured centre to the right of party leader @entity1 , at the @entity2 annual party conference			1
a party spokesman said evidence obtained by @entity2 in its investigations had been forwarded to the police ‘ i joined @entity2 because i thought it was dedicated to those goals			1
but i now realise that @entity2 is more concerned with furthering its own interests as a political party than delivering for the @entity42 people			2
‘ i have come to the conclusion that it is only with @entity8 and the @entity136 that we can achieve a referendum on @entity119 , and an immigration system that works for @entity42			1
a vote for @entity2 will only deliver a @entity141 , which will deny people a referendum and control over our borders			2
i have done this with a heavy heart , but i feel i must do right by my country			0
’ the defection deal was brokered by @entity136 mep @entity150 and sealed when @entity0 met @entity8 in the prime minister ’s constituency office in @entity153 on friday			1
@entity0 , 62 , was @entity2 ’s spokesman on small businesses			1
he moved to @entity155 aged eight and spent 15 years as a member of the @entity136 before switching to @entity2 two years ago in protest at @entity8 ’s ‘ modernising agenda ’			1
he said of gay marriage in 2013 : ‘ it is a big mistake to meddle in an age - old institution			0
’ he also wanted to cut @entity109 red tape and tighten border controls , saying : ‘ we have to seriously restrict immigration to the people who can add value to our country			0
’ last year it was revealed that a @entity171 curry house run by mr @entity0 ’s sons , @entity173 and @entity174 , had been fined an undisclosed amount for employing illegal immigrants			1
a @entity2 party source said mr @entity0 had been aware for some time that he was being investigated and suggested that the suspension was the reason for his defection @entity0 : ' i have decided to leave @entity2 because it has become a vanity project for @entity1 ' i have decided to leave @entity2 because it has become a vanity project for @entity1 and because many of the criticisms made of the party are true			1
@entity8 famously said that @entity2 was a party of ‘ fruitcakes , loonies and closet racists ’			1
certainly , i have experienced racism in @entity2			0
i have been racially abused on social media by other @entity2 members who ask offensive questions like : ‘ are you a @entity199 ? ’ i was angry when i was the only @entity2 politician who was cut out of a video of speeches at a party event			2
i complained that it was because of my ethnic minority background , but was fobbed off			0
some of the antics of @entity2 @entity67 are appalling			0
they make childish remarks during debates and are abusive towards meps from other countries when there is no call for it			0
i was outraged when i heard mr @entity1 talk of a ‘ fifth column ’ of immigrants in @entity42			0
i have worked hard all my life , and when my father came to this country he worked his socks off to provide for his family			0
it is an insult for him to talk in this way			0
i joined @entity2 because i wanted a referendum on the @entity109 and wanted better controls on immigration			2
but now i have no doubt that mr @entity8 will deliver on this , so , in my view , @entity2 has outlived its usefulness			1
mr @entity1 wants to use @entity2 as a means for getting power for himself , and that is not what the party was set up to achieve			1
he has created a popularist image for himself as the jolly chap at the bar with a pint in his hand , but the reality is different			0
he runs the party like a dictator , employs people who are totally inappropriate for party positions and gets rid of anybody who stands in his way			0
@entity2 is guided more by dogma than common sense			0
since i became an mep , i have been amazed that @entity2 often votes against @entity42 ’s national interest in the @entity252			0
for example , we were told to vote against @entity109 money for flood relief schemes in the @entity42 because the money had come from @entity258			0
i protested that this was ridiculous because much of the @entity109 money was @entity42 in the first place , but i was ignored			0
and @entity2 ’s reaction on finding out that i was going to join the @entity136 sums up what is wrong with them			2
they made a crude attempt to smear me with false allegations of irregularities in the recruitment of @entity271 members in @entity155			0
there is not a shred of truth in any of the claims but it has made me more convinced than ever that i made the right decision			0
there is no escaping one simple fact : when mr @entity8 said : ‘ if you go to bed with @entity1 on election night , you will wake with @entity103 the next day , ’ he was telling the truth .			2

@entity285 said ' @entity2 is pointless ' before defecting to @entity136 party
he said @entity2 was ' pretty amateur ' and had a ' ridiculous ' lack of policies
mr @entity0 *believes* only @entity8 can give us @entity119 referendum
came as party said he was suspended over ' extremely serious ' allegations
they include claims of interference with the candidate selection process
@entity2 spokesman said evidence obtained has been forwarded to police
