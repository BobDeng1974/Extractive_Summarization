they used to say that when @entity2 sneezed , the world caught a cold , but this year , in the world of beauty at least , we ’re all going to be catching the @entity7 bug			1
because the newest , most exciting products all have a distinctly eastern flavour			1
the @entity7 craze all began with @entity11 — technically short for @entity12 , but essentially rebranded tinted moisturisers			1
‘ bb creams were big in @entity20 because the girls liked the cuteness of saying “ @entity23 ” , ’ explains @entity14 , international beauty director for publisher @entity17 ’s @entity16 division			1
‘ there was nothing special about them , it was just another way of selling an existing product			1
’ the @entity7 cosmetic craze began with @entity11 ( @entity12 ) , which quickly became popular in @entity31 thanks to online promotions ( pictured posed by model ) but thanks to the internet , the trend quickly spread , and as soon as @entity31 brands saw an appetite for @entity11 , they started bringing out their own			1
they also started to keep a close eye on what was happening in @entity20			1
because while @entity11 were not much more than clever marketing , some genuine innovation is emerging			2
‘ there ’s a big pharmaceutical industry there which the government has ploughed money into , ’ says @entity14			2
‘ cosmetic developments have come alongside it			2
’ so , among this year ’s slew of @entity7 - influenced new products , which ones are worth looking out for ? @entity54 @entity55 £ 29.50 , nationwide these cushion cosmetics are a huge hit in @entity20 , and @entity58 is the first @entity59 brand to launch a version			1
essentially a sponge saturated with a light foundation , it comes inside a compact with a mirror and pad - style applicator			1
verdict : a brilliantly easy way to carry a liquid foundation around with you			2
it comes in six shades with refills costing £ 19.50			2
@entity73 @entity74 £ 12.50 for 50 sheets , thisisbeautymart.com these papers , infused with a powder blush , come in three shades , from a golden apricot to sun - kissed bronze			1
just pat the paper against your face — one sheet does both cheeks			2
verdict : if you ’ve ever found your blusher in pieces after carting it around in your handbag , you ’ll appreciate these			2
they make it incredibly simple to top up your blusher on the go			2
@entity93 masks @entity94 £ 9.99 for three , boots masks are a huge @entity7 trend — from gel and fabric ones that make you look like @entity102 to conventional mud and cream varieties			1
these have give skin a serious dose of hydration			0
verdict : they really do boost hydration , temporarily erasing fine lines			0
@entity112 30 % @entity113 30 % £ 22.50 , @entity114 a collaboration between a @entity7 scientist and a @entity119 beauty obsessive , @entity115 has been a beauty insider secret in the @entity31 for a while			1
this lotion , based on @entity16 herbs , is designed to be used either as a toner , or with the cotton mask provided to create a mask			0
verdict : delicately scented but not overpowering , if you ’re looking for a new toner , this leaves skin soft , and hydrated			0
ideal for those who do n’t like the dewy finish			0
it also comes in six shades			0
@entity135 £ 29.99 , skinpep.com hi - tech beauty gadgets are big news in @entity16 , so it ’s no surprise that this @entity7 brand offers a vibrating puff that promises a flawless finish for foundation			1
verdict : if you ’re prone to ending up blotchy through applying foundation unevenly , this is a bit of a godsend			0
the puff is anti-microbial and vibrates around 12,000 times a minute to really work foundation into the skin , giving a dewy , natural and even result that a regular sponge or brush simply ca n’t compete with			0
this works no @entity154 essence this works no @entity156 £ 30 , thisworks.com this is inspired by @entity7 ‘ essences ’ — water - based formulas that combine the properties of a toner , serum and moisturiser			1
just pat a couple of drops on your face after cleansing			0
verdict : many toners are alcohol - heavy and leave skin dry			1
it also contains hyaluronic acid , which attracts moisture to the skin			0
@entity174 egg white bubble @entity175 @entity176 £ 19 , cultbeauty.co.uk this quirky brand offers a range of off - beat products boasting ingredients as curious as starfish extract and snail secretion			1
in that context , the eggshell membrane extract in this foaming cleanser seems pretty pedestrian			0
verdict : weird ingredients aside , this has a clean , soapy scent			0
it removes grime without leaving skin tight or dry			0
@entity193 from around £ 1 , ebay.co.uk these simple but quirky hair accessories — basically the hook side of velcro , cut into heart or bow shapes — are used to hold hair off your face when washing or applying make up			0
you can also find them on @entity204			0
verdict : they might look like they ’re designed for teenagers , but they ’re quicker and easier than using a hairband or clip , and much less likely to mess up a blow dry .			0
