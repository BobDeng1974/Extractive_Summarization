one 12 - year - old , @entity80 , said : ' it 's worse on @entity79 , i say , because there are groups , and then say i went for dinner there ’d be like 100 messages and you just ca n’t be bothered to read them , and then you miss something			0

' while @entity6 children embrace smartphones more , and are more positive about their benefits ( especially for keeping in touch with friends ) , smartphones clearly have their downsides too ; forexample , a third of children felt the pressure to be available for contact through these devices , andmore children in the @entity6 than across @entity4 are also now reporting a range of negative consequences			0

@entity221 , head of safeguarding at @entity222 , said : ' young people 's increasing exposure to negative user - generated content , such as bullying via social media or sites about self - harming , is a sobering reminder of the potential risks to children online			2
' increased smartphone and tablet usage means parents and teachers can not always supervise young people 's activity , however talking to young people about internet use can effectively build resilience and protect against potentially damaging or disturbing content			0
