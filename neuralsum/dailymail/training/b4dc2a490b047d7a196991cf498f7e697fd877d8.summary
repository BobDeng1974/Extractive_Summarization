@entity0 said modern parenting styles , and particularly a reluctance to say ' no ' to children , were harming their offspring parents are increasingly adopting a ‘ spreadsheet ’ approach to family life and treating their children as friends instead of asserting their authority , according to a leading psychologist and broadcaster			1
in a speech to head teachers , professor @entity0 spelled out how modern parenting styles – including an unwillingness to say ‘ no ’ to children - may be doing more harm than good			1
some parents project their own ideas about success onto their children and force them to lead over-scheduled lives filled with activities , she said			1
this ‘ spreadsheet ’ approach leads to children being pushed in directions that ‘ bear no resemblance to what they feel or want for themselves ’			2
parents also increasingly struggle to say ‘ no ’ to their children and try to act as their equal rather than their boss , she added			1
these ‘ friend - parents ’ are leaving youngsters ill - equipped for the real world and forcing schools to step in to lay down boundaries			1
addressing the @entity41 ’ @entity40 , professor @entity42 said : ‘ a lot of parents feel completely disabled to parent			1
i see the friend - parent phenomenon			0
i see it when they ’re very young			0
’ but she added : ‘ this idea that i have to be my child ’s friend is a really dangerous one			0
you need to say no and give them containment and structure			0
‘ i remember when my parents said no. you sucked it up			2
‘ the problem for a lot of children is that their parents have n’t said no since they were little so by the time they get to be a teenager they ’re b * * * ered			1
' i do n’t get what the issue is			0
why ca n’t parents say no ? what ’s the problem ? ’ professor @entity42 , who has been a clinical psychologist for 25 years and featured on the @entity73 series @entity74 , added : ‘ the problem for schools is that not only do you have to educate kids and help them eat a healthy diet , you ’ve kind of got to parent them as well			1
' it is a systemic approach [ that is required ] and looking at how parents need to establish boundaries			2
’ she had also observed how ‘ some families have an almost spreadsheet approach to parenting ’			0
‘ we all want the best for our children but there are parents where the best is a huge projection , so that the child reflects something about them as parents , ’ she told the @entity89 , which represents independent girls ’ schools			1
‘ there ’s nothing wrong with being ambitious but i meet a number of children who have been pushed and crafted into something that bears no resemblance to what they feel about or want for themselves			2
’ professor @entity42 also said parents were being too friendly with their children , and were unwilling to assert their authority which wsa doing more harm than good in a further warning , professor @entity42 highlighted that growing numbers of teenagers are suffering from eating disorders and self - harm due to the pressure of exams			1
she said she was astonished at the attitude of some parents who were worried that treating problems might interfere with exam preparation			2
‘ parents are often very concerned and shocked at how any treatment may impact on their child ’s continued preparation for exams , ’ she added			0
‘ for instance , you may tell them that their child may not be able to do her gcses at present			0
’ parents ’ attitudes can cause ‘ incredible damage ’ to their child , she said			0
professor @entity42 said that self - harm among boys was also increasing , and that even the children of ‘ aspirational middle class parents ’ were vulnerable			1
‘ it is absolutely heart - breaking and it is increasing , ’ she added			0
professor @entity42 , who advised the last government on the impact of video games and the internet on young people , went on to warn that some vulnerable youngsters were at risk from social media since they were using it in ‘ really unhelpful ’ ways			1
‘ children are digital natives , we are digital immigrants , ’ she added			0
the conference heard earlier in the week how social media sites such as @entity159 and @entity160 are creating a generation of timid parents who are afraid to discipline their teenage children for fear of being shamed on social media			2
according to @entity89 president @entity167 , grumpy teens are increasingly refusing to back down in rows with their parents as friends egg them on via social networking sites			0
parents are becoming ‘ less bold and intuitive ’ when disciplining adolescents amid fears that family disputes will be broadcast to hundreds of friends online , she claimed .			0

professor @entity42 says modern parents can not say ' no ' to children
*couples* are also projecting their ideas of success on to youngsters
' kids end up living from spreadsheets that do *n't* reflect what they want '
