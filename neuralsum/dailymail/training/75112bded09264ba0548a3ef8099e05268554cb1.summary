by @entity0 published : 09:55 est , 27 january 2014 updated : 14:28 est , 27 january 2014 a @entity3 family auctioned the chance to name their ninth baby - with bids starting at $ 20,000			1
the family posted an advert on @entity10 in january and suggested that prospective buyers may want to choose a name to honor a relative or even a @entity15 victim			1
despite the ad , the baby was named @entity18 on saturday - without the influence of any bidders			1
the @entity22 family said they planned to use the money to help with school tuition fees and the cost of living in their home in @entity29			2
after the peculiar ad was posted , it was removed from @entity10 for violating the terms of service			1
the man who wrote the ad contacted the @entity22 news service @entity47 to say that his ad was indeed a real offer			2
@entity50 reports that the family got four offers before the ad was removed			1
the father wrote in his ad , ' this is an excellent opportunity for someone who did not have children , or someone looking to honor a relative , or even to honor someone who was killed in the @entity15			0
' the @entity47 interviewed the father who identified himself as a schoolteacher from @entity29			0
when asked what the family would do with the $ 20,000 , he said he would use the funds to support his child			1
the father explained that tuition in @entity29 and rent is quite expensive			0
this is the family 's ninth daughter and the family already used family names for their other children			2
the family said they would like a baby name and a secular name but would n't accept ' crazy names ' like ' @entity80 '			1
they say they 'd prefer something @entity84			0
when a @entity22 baby is given a name , family and friends gather for a small ceremony in the @entity22 tradition , children receive both a biblical name and a secular name because one is used for religious purposes and ceremonies and the other is used in the everyday world			1
@entity99 and friends hold a small baby naming ceremony			0
if the baby is a boy , he will be circumcised			0
the family originally said they would treat whomever named their daughter like a loved member of the family			1
' we ’d stay in touch with her , invite her to the bat mitzvah , wedding , say @entity116 for them after 120 years , ' said the father			0
@entity47 interviewed the father and asked him why he came up with the idea to post an ad on @entity10			1
' about four or five years ago , i remember hearing in the news that someone else did the same thing			0
we ’re a little rushed ; we ’d like to name the baby on saturday			0
we tried to post it to @entity130 , but it was a little more complicated than we thought , so we posted it on @entity10 , ' he said			2
the father asked @entity47 to put out a press release saying he is auctioning the right to sell his daughter 's name			2
the @entity47 offered help by setting up an email address for readers to send their naming suggestions but the family decided to come up with their own original name for their little bundle of ' joy ' .			0

despite the @entity10 ad , the baby was named @entity149 which means ' joy ' in @entity40 , *independently* of any bidders
the family said they planned to use the $ 20,000 to support their child
they originally asked for someone to give their daughter both a biblical name and a secular name
they said they would not accept crazy names like ' *box* '
the @entity10 ad was removed from @entity10 for violating its terms of service but the family got four offers since they first posted the ad
