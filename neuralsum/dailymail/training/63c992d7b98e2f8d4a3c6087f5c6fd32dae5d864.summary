a perfect gentleman from @entity1 will be in @entity2 on wednesday shaking hands , smiling and exchanging courtesies not only in his own language but in @entity6 – and in @entity7 or @entity8 should citizens of those countries happen to be in the room			1
do not be fooled , this is one of the most feared fighters in boxing today			0
@entity15 knocks out opponents for fun , 28 of them in 31 bouts for a 90 per cent ko ratio , which is the highest in modern middleweight championship history			1
@entity15 throws a jab at @entity22 during his world title win in october higher , then , than @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27			1
no wonder most of the starrier names in the division have been ducking this man like the plague			0
to look at that happy , fresh face you might think you are in the company of a youngster in his graduate year at university			0
@entity15 is 32 and extremely wise in the ways of the world			1
not least the boxing world which kept him waiting until he was almost 30 for his chance to win a world title			0
since that explosive day only one of his challengers has survived longer than eight rounds and even he was gone two rounds later			0
no rival has come close to beating him in those 31 professional bouts			2
he has never been put down , let alone knocked out , in 375 fights as a world amateur champion and in the paid ring			2
@entity15 throws another big left at @entity22 during his knockout victory over the @entity59 the @entity1 takes a bow after winning against @entity22 inside two rounds to extend his stoppage streak it takes a brave man to get into the ring with one of boxing ’s archetypal baby - faced assassins			1
our own , admirable three - time world title challenger @entity72 nerved himself to do that last year			1
for his courage he was felled in the third round by a body shot which left him writhing on the canvas and which he describes as ‘ the most powerful punch i have ever been hit with			2
@entity72 has warned the man from @entity81 of the dangers which lie ahead but @entity79 believes he can meet the most daunting challenge boxing can offer at the moment and win a world title at his third attempt			1
@entity79 has been robbed in @entity7 by the home - town decision awarded to the then @entity89 champion @entity88			1
after that he ventured into the @entity91 lair of @entity93 ring maestro @entity92			0
there he came agonisingly close to winning the @entity96 belt before suffering his only defeat in 31 fights			1
it was very close , somewhat controversial , but a loss nonetheless			0
now for @entity15 , who has become a favourite of the @entity103 cable tv network in @entity104 but is travelling to @entity105 for this one on february 21			1
@entity79 ( left ) is next up for the all - conquering @entity15 after beating @entity107 in october that is partly because the reformed @entity79 ’s criminal record precludes him from obtaining a @entity104 visa			1
for @entity15 , this a holding exercise while he awaits a first mega pay - per - view fight in @entity104 , perhaps against @entity113 or @entity114			1
but @entity79 says : ‘ i can be the first to topple him			2
’ wednesday 's gathering is a pleasantry designed to alert the boxing public in this country to their coming battle for the @entity89 title			0
but he never ducks anyone , either			0
he knows that when the charming chap he welcomes to this country this morning appears in the opposite corner in @entity127 , mr @entity15 will be no more mr @entity128			2
if @entity131 's opponent took a dive his win was a despicable act there are allegations that the opponent who @entity131 - @entity142 actor and once a bit - part boxer - knocked out in @entity144 by way of making a bizarre ring comeback at the disturbing age of 62 was in fact a down - and - out living rough on the streets of @entity137 who was paid to take a dive			2
@entity131 ( right ) faces his opponent , whom it was alleged was paid to take a dive in the fight if so , this is as much sad as despicable			2
sad for the hobo , of course but also for @entity131 who , it is further suggested , needs the money from not only this joke fight but as many more as he can finagle			0
if the allegations are in fact revelations , this supply of cash will dry up pronto			0
@entity131 was a hell - raiser in @entity142 but celebrity of the infamous genre is rarely insurance against humiliation in later life			0
sad for him too , then , that there should be no place in boxing for circus acts like his .			0

@entity15 has won all his 31 fights
*twenty* - eight of those victory were by knockout
briton @entity72 was felled in the third by @entity15
@entity79 will fight the @entity1 in @entity105 in february
