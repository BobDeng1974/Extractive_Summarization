@entity0 , the @entity2 general and former prime minister who proved such a controversial figure across the @entity4 for more than five decades , died yesterday			1
nicknamed @entity6 for his tenacious approach to war and politics , @entity5 suffered a serious stroke in 2006 and remained in a coma until his death			1
but millions more will remember him as the @entity35 of @entity36 , infamously allowing the slaughter of refugees in @entity39			0
perhaps the only point of agreement is that he was one of the central characters in the turbulent drama of the @entity4			0
@entity0 was born in 1928 to middle - class parents who had emigrated from @entity45 , and he grew up near @entity46			1
he joined the underground @entity48 army aged 14			0
six years later , he fought in the 1948 war of independence , where he was wounded , then made his name in the new @entity52			0
resting - place : @entity53 stands by the grave of his mother @entity55 in southern @entity2			1
@entity0 is expected to be buried there as well remembrance : the plot of land is not far from the @entity5 family farm in @entity61 , @entity2 comfort : @entity53 kisses one of his twin sons ( unidentified ) as his wife @entity65 and his older son @entity66 ( r ) gather near the grave site tourists : @entity2 visit the plot where late the late prime minister will be laid to rest @entity71 , @entity2 's founding prime minister , admired @entity5 and asked him to establish an elite commando unit			1
within months , @entity74 had earned @entity2 its first condemnation by the @entity76 after a raid on a @entity79 town that left 69 people dead			1
but @entity5 recovered from the furore and went on to play key roles in @entity2 's subsequent wars			1
in the 1973 @entity85 , he defied orders to take 5,000 men through @entity89 lines , a daring move that changed the course of the conflict and cemented his heroic status among @entity2			2
' when he decided to go ' : @entity53 , @entity0 's son , today confirmed the news of his father 's death upon entering politics , @entity5 was renowned as a hawk , supporting the creation of @entity48 settlements in occupied territories			1
in 1982 , came the moment that made him such a hate figure across the @entity107 world when , as defence minister , he ordered @entity2 troops into @entity39			2
it ended with them besieging @entity36 and standing by as @entity39 militia massacred thousands in refugee camps			0
@entity5 denied responsibility , but he was sacked as defence minister and condemned by an inquiry			2
unexpectedly , he bounced back to become leader of the right - wing party @entity118 , and was elected premier in 2001 on a promise of peace and security after his provocative visit to a @entity16 mosque helped spark a @entity127 uprising			2
@entity0 gestures during a visit to an army lookout in @entity130 in the @entity79 valley , january 3 2001 friendship : @entity0 and @entity133 shake hands at a joint news conference in @entity16 in december 2004 ' important figure ' : in this photograph from december 2005 , @entity0 addresses the @entity138 in @entity46 @entity0 and former @entity140 president @entity139 holding a joint news conference at @entity139 's @entity143 ranch in @entity144 , 2005 @entity0 taking a ride on a mini-tractor on his ranch in southern @entity2 with his wife @entity55 and one of his grandchildren @entity5 receiving a baggage car ride at @entity152 on his first visit to @entity154 @entity5 ( 2nd left ) sitting in a jeep during a tour on october 1973 @entity5 , an @entity2 soldier in 1948 , holds a weapon during the war of @entity2 's founding 1928 - born in @entity161 1942 - signs up to @entity163 youth battalion 1956 - brigade commander in 1956 @entity166 1969 - made head of @entity52 's @entity168 1973 - turns tide of @entity170 1973 - joins centre - right @entity118 party 1981 - becomes minister of defense 1982 - directs @entity173 1998 - becomes minister of foreign affairs 2001 - becomes 11th prime minister 2006 - suffers a severe stroke yet suddenly - worried by @entity107 population growth and @entity140 political weakness - this 20st tough - guy started talking about the inevitability of a @entity127 state			1

who knows what he might have achieved had he not been struck down by successive strokes on the brink of winning a crucial election ? for , as so often in history , who better to make peace than a hardliner forged in war ? instead came eight years of fighting death with the same fierce determination that he showed throughout his life			0
