blushing bride : @entity17 being taken away by an official after being arrested at her sham wedding ceremony not so happy couple : @entity4 was paid just £ 400 to marry @entity8 so that he could remain in @entity21 yesterday the 33 - year - old was jailed , along with her intended husband and their matchmaker			1
the scam was uncovered after the registrar became suspicious as @entity4 and her 25 - year - old fiancé exchanged little in the way of conversation ahead of their august wedding			1
prosecutor @entity33 told @entity34 : ‘ it was apparent that there was very little verbal communication between the bride and groom '			2

‘ they did n’t share a common language and @entity52 was needed to interpret			0
not one of you realised how transparent a sham this was			0
‘ you all told police a pack of lies – and @entity4 telling them it was love at first sight was an outrageous lie '			0
