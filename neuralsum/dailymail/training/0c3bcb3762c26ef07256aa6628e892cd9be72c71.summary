by @entity0 it is billed as the future of food - a drink that can replace every meal , providing the body with everything it needs to suruve without ever having to cook			1
called @entity10 , it became a huge online hit when it was launched last year and thousands ordered it			1
now @entity13 has been able to try one of the first batches of the drink to be sold			1
the drink is designed to replace meals soylent is a futuristic meal replacement formula developed by a group of engineers bent on revolutionizing the way we fuel our bodies			1
the powdery mixture contains no fruits , vegetables or dairy products , yet claims to fulfill all of the human body 's dietary needs			1
it contains 35 nutrients needed for survival			2
@entity37 , the 25 - year - old co-founder and chief executive of the company selling the food substitute developed the mixture in 2012 while working for a start - up			1
he found the process of purchasing , preparing , and consuming food too time consuming and expensive , and hypothesized that ‘ the body does n't need food itself , merely the chemicals and elements it contains			1
’ @entity37 took a hiatus from experimenting with software , and began experimenting with meal replacement			1
he studied health and nutrition books , poured over data from the @entity56 and @entity57 , and eventually came up with a list of 35 nutrients needed for survival			2
he ordered the necessary components off the internet , sloshed them into a blender , and began living off of it			2
after 30 days straight consuming nothing but the substance he felt better than he had in his entire life			2
his food costs also plummeted from over $ 500 a month , to $ 154.82			1
his roommates saw the dramatic effect @entity10 had on @entity37 ’s life and health and decided to set up a crowdfunding campaign to sell the concoction to the public			1
‘ hunger comes from chemicals triggered by a lack of nutrients as well as mechano - sensors in the stomach			1
' soylent is a brown , thick liquid once mixed with water ' if there 's something in your stomach and all your nutritional needs are met you wo n't feel hungry ’ @entity37 explains on his blog			1
‘ i feel full after drinking a single glass of @entity10 and while the smell of @entity95 food from the street used to drive me crazy , now i am unaffected			2
' ' it 's like finding a new partner you really care about			1
' ' when all your needs are met , you do n't have a desire to stray			2
’ @entity37 claims that while living off @entity10 his physique improved , his skin was clearer , his teeth whiter , and his hair thicker			1
' i felt like i 'd just had the best breakfast of my life ’ he wrote after sampling his first @entity10 meal , ‘ it tasted like a sweet , succulent , hearty meal in a glass			2
’ @entity0 's first taste : she says @entity10 is neither sweet nor savory - and a ' nothing food ' @entity13 decided to put the product to the test and see if this food substitute really holds water			1
the first thing you ’re confronted with when you slice open a box of @entity10 is a manifesto			2
‘ the powder you now behold is more than meets the eye ’ the pamphlet professes , ‘ this mix of mass , energy , and information is the staple food of the future			2
refined , robust and efficient , @entity10 is food that works			2
’ below this inspirational card are large pre-packaged 2,000 calorie bags of soylent mix tucked between tubes of oil - the only ingredients needed ( plus water ) to produce an entire meal			1
i removed a single packet and laid it on the counter with the oil and a soylent - branded measuring cup			1
i decided to make two servings , lunch and dinner , in one fell swoop			0
normally , preparing two separate meals requires multiple ingredients , conflicting preparation methods and a lot of time			0
the thought of preparing both lunch and dinner in a single easy mix appealed to me already			0
i scooped the allocated amount of powder into my mixing jar , added the water and oil , and proceeded to stir			0
soylent instructions offer three methods of preparation : stirring , blending and shaking			0
after 8 - 10 minutes of stirring i wished i had a blender			1
soylent instructions offer three methods of preparation : stirring , blending and shaking			0
it ’s difficult to get the @entity10 powder to fully blend , and i noticed small pockets of dry mixture clumping together like half - done pancake batter			1
i shook the container vigorously until the @entity10 was as smooth as a chocolate frosty			0
soylent is best served cold , and i briefly considered refrigerating the drink before sampling my first sip			1
some people blend it with ice , but using chilled water seemed to adequately cool the mixture			1
i poured my first portion into a thermos			0
the @entity10 smell hit my nostrils before my taste buds			0
the beverage smells sterile , but not unappealing , and reminded me of the type of @entity192 shakes my mother used to drink in the 90s			1
it sort of tasted that way too , but less chocolaty			0
i assumed , probably because of the color , that the drink would be sweet			1
in fact , it ’s neither sweet nor savory			0
soylent does n’t really have a distinct flavor			0
it truly is a ‘ non food ’ in this respect			0
the allocated amount of powder into my mixing jar , then water and oil is added			0
it lives up to its utilitarian beginnings , it ’s not burdened with food - like artificial flavors or sweeteners			1
i can see why some suggest blending @entity10 with peanut butter , almond milk , or banana			0
the texture of the drink is equally benign			2
it ’s slightly mealy ( though this could be due to how i prepared it )			0
it is n’t so thick that it ’s hard to swallow , but it ’s also not smooth enough to chug			0
my liquid lunch companion compared it to mealy @entity231			0
the after - taste was as strong as the taste , but not overwhelming			2
i was left with a cardboard nutty flavor in the back of my throat			0
it tasted like i had swallowed something milky , but there was no film or residue clinging to my tongue			0
after consuming 80 % of the bottle my hunger was gone and i felt content on a baseline level			0
i was n’t craving more food , but i could n’t shake the feeling that i had missed a meal			0
in fact , i ended up snacking on some quinoa a few hours later and the action of chewing alone left me feeling more satisfied			0
but overall , i ’m not sold			0
after two meals of @entity10 , i think i ’d rather chew on cake than sip the healthiest cake batter			0
@entity37 ’s company has n’t conducted any large - scale nutritional studies ( though they claim one is in the works ) , but there ’s no doubt that the formula is safe and more nutritious than most of what you ’d find on the shelves of your local vending machine			1
' now that i 've discovered @entity10 , i 'm healthier than i 've ever been , have more freedom with my time and money , and never have to worry about the stuff			0
' finally , i can have my cake and eat it too ' , @entity37 professes on his website			1
you can purchase the mixture pre-made on @entity275 or follow the recipe on their website and mix a batch from scratch			2

drink costs $ 3 per serving and can be bought in bulk online
powdery mixture contains no fruits , vegetables or dairy products
claims to fulfill all of the human body 's dietary needs .
