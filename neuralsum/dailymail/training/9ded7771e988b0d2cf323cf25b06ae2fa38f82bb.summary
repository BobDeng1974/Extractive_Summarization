@entity0 , who stepped down from @entity5 last year , was asked at a @entity7 conference what he thought of the allegations against @entity4			1
' i do n't know why it 's so hard to believe women			1
i mean , you go to @entity14 and you need two women to testify against a man ; here you need 25 , ' he replied			2
many of those allegations are decades old and fall outside the statute of limitations for criminal or civil cases			2
@entity4 's attorney @entity31 has dismissed the allegations as ' discredited ' and ' defamatory			1
' at wednesday 's conference , @entity0 added that he supported the way the allegations against @entity4 were brought into the spotlight , after stand - up comedian @entity37 called @entity4 a rapist during a performance last october			1
' he made a flat - out statement that reverberated around the world			0
if that was on tv , it would have been edited			0
if it were on any other medium , it would have been edited , ' @entity0 said			0
' but because somebody just filmed it and put it out there , you 're getting your news raw and unfiltered , which i think is fantastic			0
' he dated the beginning of the change in media 's control over the news back to the beating of @entity62 in 1991 , which was captured by a bystander with a video camera			2
' ten years earlier the @entity62 story would have come to a news editor and he would have said , " oh , this is too explosive to put on the air			0
let 's just put on what the police say			0
" ' but this went on tv raw			0
you saw what actually happened			0
' hello friend : @entity4 performs at the @entity76 in @entity77 , @entity78			1
@entity4 's attorney @entity31 has dismissed the allegations against his client as ' discredited ' and ' defamatory			1
' @entity0 's comments come after actor @entity83 , who played @entity4 's son on television , told music trade magazine @entity86 that he found it painful to hear the claims that the comedian sexually abused more than a dozen women			1
@entity83 , who played @entity91 on ' @entity92 ' in the 1980s and 1990s , said the allegations do not match @entity4 's reputation			1
' the @entity4 i know has been great to me and great for a lot of people , ' @entity83 was quoted as saying			2
' just as it 's painful to hear any woman talk about sexual assault , whether true or not , it 's just as painful to watch my friend and mentor go through this			0
' the 44 - year - old @entity83 joined ' @entity92 ' actors @entity105 and @entity107 in defending the 77 - year - old comedian			0
' he 's been very influential and played a big role in my life as a friend and mentor , ' @entity83 said			0
