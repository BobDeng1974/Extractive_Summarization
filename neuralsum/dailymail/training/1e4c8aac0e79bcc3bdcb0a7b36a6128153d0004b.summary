president @entity0 coolly taunted congressional republicans on wednesday for dithering on his demand for billions to handle a flood of illegal immigration children streaming across the @entity7 - @entity6 border			1
at the same time he flatly denied that his own policy decisions have led to the rapidly expanding human tragedy			0
calling the deluge a ' humanitarian situation on the border , ' not an emergency or crisis , he parried claims that a 2012 executive order delaying the deportation of hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants – those who had arrived in the @entity7 as children before the summer of 2007 – incentivized children in @entity15 to make dangerous journeys to and across the @entity18 river			1
' i think the challenge we have that has really caused a spike , ' @entity0 said in @entity30 , ' is the significant security challenges in the @entity15 countries themselves , and smugglers who increasingly recognize that they can make money transporting individuals ...			1
' those conditions have n't significantly evolved since he took office in 2009 , many republicans point out			0
but a series of reports from @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 indicate that his policy , called @entity48 ( @entity48 ) , was widely misinterpreted to mean that today 's under - 18 set could enter the @entity7 and stay indefinitely			1
' the president did not directly address the rapidly growing numbers of children who now make up the largest proportion of the total by far since the @entity7 government began counting it			2
@entity0 claimed wednesday that his @entity48 policy , along with a far more ambitious ' comprehensive immigration reform ' bill that has languished in the @entity37 - controlled @entity86 , should be seen as freeing up resources to tackle short - term challenges like the one currently plaguing @entity89 and @entity90			1
' daca and comprehensive immigration reform generally , would allow us to reallocate resources , ' he said , because immigration officers would no longer be ' chasing after families who may have been here for five or 10 years and are law abiding except for the fact they they came here illegally			1
' when ' they are no longer an enforcement priority , that suddenly frees up a lot of resources , ' he said			0
his ' comprehensive ' approach ' would have put us in a stronger position to deal with this surge and , in fact , prevent it , ' @entity0 declared			2
@entity111 @entity37 have demanded that he use more of their existing appropriations to secure @entity15 's southwest border			2
a few have threatened to deny him newest funding request unless he complies			0
@entity89 gov. @entity116 met with @entity0 on wednesday in @entity30 and promptly issued a press release challenging him to do just that			1
' five hundred miles south of here in the @entity121 there is a humanitarian crisis unfolding that has been created by bad public policy , in particular the failure to secure the border			2
' confronted by a reporter who mentioned the statement , @entity0 was quick to assure the press corps that ' i 'm interested in securing the border			2
' @entity116 's role as a prop in wednesday 's presidential theater began with a handshake after @entity136 landed for a presidential fundraising stop			0
@entity138 2.0 ? @entity116 ( @entity139 ) will likely catch grief from conservative @entity37 over his welcome of @entity0 to the state where the @entity37 says the president 's policies have caused the illegal immigration flood let 's raise some money ! ( and talk about the border ) : @entity0 is in @entity89 for a pair of @entity151 fundraisers , and only recently added meetings about the border crisis to his itinerary @entity0 walked straight to the governor on the tarmac at @entity157 , hand outstretched , shook his hand and patted him on the back			1
a similar political rapprochement earned @entity163 gov. @entity138 scorn from inside his own party after he physically embraced @entity0 for rushing federal relief funds to his state after @entity167 in 2012			2
the two met with rep. @entity169 , @entity30 mayor @entity170 , @entity172 judge @entity171 and ' local faith leaders ' for a discussion			0
reporters were not permitted at the roundtable meeting			0
@entity116 , @entity0 said , had asked him to act unilaterally to put more federal government resources – including a @entity179 detachment – on the @entity6 border			1
but the president saw the suggestion as an opening to upbraid house speaker @entity184 , who plans to sue him for taking executive action that @entity37 believe short - circuits their constitutional authority			1
on @entity136 between @entity190 and @entity30 , @entity189 press secretary @entity188 pointed to @entity116 's presence as a sign that @entity0 is willing to compromise with the @entity37 about how to handle the flood of illegal immigrant children streaming into the @entity7 from @entity6			1
' after all , gov. @entity116 is a @entity37 , ' @entity188 said			2
@entity0 , however , slammed the @entity37 for refusing to write him a blank check in @entity197			0
' it would be useful for my @entity37 colleagues to rediscover the concept of negotiation and compromise , ' he said			0
roundtable : @entity0 ( r ) and @entity116 ( 2nd @entity139 ) met with local government and religious leader in @entity30 on wednesday , more than 500 miles from the border crisis itself , which he would leave the state without visiting on tuesday and wednesday a steady stream of federal legislators , including some @entity89 @entity151 , criticized the president for failing to see the border crisis firsthand			1
but he said wednesday that @entity214 , his newly minter homeland security director , ' has now visited at my direction the border five times			1
... he then comes back and reports to me extensively on everything that 's taking place			0
' ' so there 's nothing that is taking place down there that i am not intimately aware of and briefed on			0
' ' i 'm not interested in photo - ops , ' he said			0
that was n't good enough for @entity89 @entity228 sen. @entity228 , who said afterward that ' @entity229 do not need a lecture from a man who refuses to even see the crisis firsthand			0
' ' president @entity0 can fundraise and issue statements , @entity229 will work to solve the problem			0

the president spoke in @entity30 following a meeting with officials and *church* leaders about the children flooding into the @entity7 from @entity15
he calmly called the deluge a ' humanitarian situation , ' not a crisis
@entity0 *deflected* calls for him to visit the @entity7 - @entity6 border , insisting that his new homeland security secretary had gone five times already
said his ' comprehensive ' immigration reform bill could have prevented the crisis because it would have freed up resources by no longer chasing longer - term illegals
refused to acknowledge that tens of thousands of minors have poured into the @entity7 because he *relaxed* deportations of young *people* in 2012
claimed @entity89 gov. @entity116 asked hm to act without @entity263 , then *mocked* house speaker @entity184 's lawsuit aimed at stopping go - it - alone executive orders
