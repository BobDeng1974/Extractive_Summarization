trained : pictures have emerged showing how @entity3 's ' canine killers ' were deployed in the @entity4 against @entity6 tanks kitted out : the kamikaze dogs were fitted with explosives and taught to carry them to tanks , armoured vehicles and other targets battle : the use of dogs in battle was first approved in 1924 and continued into the 1990s , it is understood , with special training to ensure the dogs ran to the deaths in front of enemy tanks military expert @entity36 said : ' the @entity37 already had the experience of using dogs for a whole number of tasks , from security to taking the wounded from battlefields to delivering messages and moving arms and food to the front line			1
' so the next suggestion was to try and use dogs as delivery agents of mines to the enemy 's tanks			1
' initially , the aim was for the dog to put the bomb in position , biting on a cord to release it , or by remote control			0
however , in the heat of battle the frightened animals often failed to release the bomb and - faced with the desperate need to counter @entity69 forces surging east - the bombs were fitted to the dog and exploded on impact with the target , killing the dog			1
control : the dogs were controlled by hunger - food was put under the tanks ' the first experiments were made with mines packed inside thick canvas packs that were put on dogs ' backs , ' said @entity36			1
' inside the pack were two bags , each with 6 kg of @entity84			0
there was also a wooden saddle on top of the dog 's back , carrying explosives and disintegrating devices , with the explosive varying depending on the task - either it was the delayed action one , or the one with the pointing target sensor			1
' there was also a parachute like lock which the dog could pull in order to release the bag			0
' the idea was to train the dogs to the extent of them being able to run towards the tank , pause in the relatively safe zone , get as close as it was possible to the tank , pull the cord , let the bag go - and run back			2
' the aim was to use such dogs for multiple purposes , like enemy 's arms and fuel storehouse destruction , or any other immobile objects destruction			1
' the task proved to be too long to achieve in the war conditions - the dogs managed to learn what they needed to do , but as soon as they were put in real battlefield conditions they became confused , and ran away or quickly returned to their masters			2
' there was one famous dog called @entity127 that was like a genius during training with carrying the explosives , but even that dog did n't manage to do a real mission			2
the first group of dogs was trained for about six months			2
' faced with this failure , the @entity136 handlers developed the idea of ' disposable dogs ' , he said			2
' it died during the explosion which meant a slight change in the mine bag construction so that a dog could not remove it during its mission			0
' the explosives were just the same , two sets 6 kg of @entity84 each , with 12 kg enough to explode the bottom of the tank			2
' the chassis was seen as the most vulnerable part of the tank			0
he revealed secrets of the @entity136 training			0
' the @entity136 army used of the most basic instincts - hunger			0
' the dogs were kept without food for a while in cages , then hot food was cooked and put underneath the tanks			1
' attracted by its smell , dogs ran under the tanks and quite soon they learned that this was the only place where they could get the food			1
' very soon they were taught to get under the tanks when engines were on and during the battle field sounds imitation			1
' mission : initially , the aim was for the dog to put the bomb in position , biting on a cord to release it , or by remote control conflict : in the heat of battle the frightened animals often failed to release the bomb discredit : the @entity188 saw the use of dogs as a desperate measure by @entity3 and sought to discredit the technique for propaganda purposes claiming the @entity136 were sending dogs instead of men into battle troubled times : this photo from the @entity199 shows a @entity69 @entity200 between @entity201 and @entity202 in july 1943 while there were successes from the use of dogs , there were also reports of singular battlefield failures , not least because the @entity136 had trained them on diesel - powered tanks , while the @entity69 used gasoline engines			1
faced with the unfamiliar smell the soldier dogs became confused			2
an handler wrote on 16 october 1941 : ' most of the dogs refuse to work and aim to jump back inside the trench			0
' some exploded their bombs on the @entity136 side by darting for cover in @entity224 trenches , while others were shot as they retreated from their task			0
' nine dogs ran to the targets , but then got scared by explosions around them and tried to hide ' said the report			0
' three of them exploded , two were never found , the rest had to be destroyed by us because they were running back to us			0
' approval : the initial approval for their use came in 1924 from the @entity241 of the @entity136			0
the @entity37 recruited circus trainers and hunters to school their new canine conscripts there is also evidence from the kkvd - precursor to the @entity248 - that the use of ' anti-tank dogs ' sapped morale among soldiers			1
one conscript complained : ' there are enough people being destroyed			0
now they are killing dogs too			0
' the @entity257 also trained dogs for use against military installations but did not deploy them			0

morale : there is also evidence from the kkvd - precursor to the @entity248 - that the use of ' anti-tank dogs ' sapped morale among soldiers the @entity37 recruited circus trainers and hunters to school their new canine conscripts			1
it was in 1935 that ' anti-mine dog units ' were officially included in the @entity272 , and pictures show them in 1938 parading on @entity274			0
in 1941 the first dogs deployed by @entity3 at the frontline			1
there were 30 dogs and 40 trainers			0
it did n't take long for the @entity69 to shoot three dogs and take possession of the device used to carry the bombs			2
the @entity188 saw the use of dogs as a desperate measure by @entity3 and sought to discredit the technique for propaganda purposes claiming the @entity136 were sending dogs instead of men into battle			1
claims vary over the effectiveness of the dogs , but there is documentary evidence of successes , for example at the @entity199 when 16 dogs disabled 12 @entity69 tanks .			2
