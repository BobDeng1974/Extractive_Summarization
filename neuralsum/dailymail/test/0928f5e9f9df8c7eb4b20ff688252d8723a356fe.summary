controversial plans to spend £ 3.2million pulling down a 19th century country mansion and building a ' @entity3 - style ' gipsy camp have been approved despite angry protests by neighbours			1
villagers in the small country hamlet of @entity8 , near @entity9 in @entity10 , had vehemently opposed the plans saying that travellers could ' intimidate ' nearby pensioners and may ruin the idyllic surroundings			1
but yesterday , @entity15 gave the proposal the go ahead at a planning meeting , which will create a ' transit site ' with room for nine gipsy families			1
the 200 - year - old @entity22 in the small hamlet of @entity8 in @entity10 which is being knocked down to make way for a ' @entity3 - style ' gipsy camp costing £ 3.2million people living in the village have reacted with fury about the plans saying travellers could intimidate nearby pensioners the mansion 's @entity31 listed adjoining barn will be converted into ' washing and toilet ' facilities and office accommodation for a resident warden will also be provided at the expense of taxpayers			1
the cost of the project , revealed through a @entity43 request , has left locals stunned , and they now fear their picturesque cottages will be left worthless as they contemplate selling up and leaving the area			1
@entity48 - listed @entity47 , which dates back to 1822 , was severely damaged by fire three years ago and its listing was cancelled			1
it will be fully demolished to make way for the site which will house gypsy families for a maximum of 28 days before they must move on			1
around 100 letters of opposition were handed to the council alongside a petition comprising 500 signatures but they will continue with the plans - which also include a play area - in efforts to put a stop to ‘ unauthorised encampments ’			1
the £ 3.2million cost of the project was only revealed through a @entity43 request and got the go ahead yesterday by @entity15 @entity47 , which dates back to 1822 , was severely damaged by fire three years ago and its @entity31 listing was cancelled builder @entity69 , 66 , bought a ‘ dream ’ retirement cottage with his wife @entity72 , 61 , and has spent £ 130,000 renovating it with original @entity76 fittings			1
it now lies , almost finished , at the site ’s entrance but he is refusing to move into it and fears he could lose £ 100,000 if it is put on the market			1
he said : ' we ’re totally gutted			2
we ’re not going to live there now			0
can we sell it ? it ’s going to be so hard to sell			0
we honestly do n’t know what to do			0
' most of my life savings have gone into this cottage			0
do we chop the price to half of what it was worth or do we sit on it ? would anybody want to rent it from opposite a gypsy site ? ' we were so confident we were going to get somewhere in that meeting because we had strong arguments especially in regards to fire safety , as the plans put the caravans too close together which flouts regulations			1

he says he was only given three minutes to voice his concerns on behalf of residents at the planning meeting mr @entity69 beside the house he bought in @entity115 as a retirement home			1
he is refusing to move into the property and fears he could lose £ 100,000 if it is put on the market ' if they have to be three metres apart they may have to reduce the number of caravans			0
that means they could be spending up to £ 5million to accommodate six to eight families			0
' these types of transit families in @entity10 can be obstructive , they may fight with police , defecate in hedges , leave rubbish everywhere			0
these are not the sort of neighbours that @entity136 want opposite them			1
' at the planning meeting , the strategic planning board of @entity15 had eight votes in favour of the site , with one against			1
three members abstained from voting			0
residents also raised concerns that the new site would destroy local wildlife which had settled on the site of @entity47 , including grass snakes , hedgehogs and toads			2
a planning permission sign next to @entity47			0
@entity15 say the development is needed to house travellers in the area mr @entity69 added : ' none of us can understand why the council should think it necessary to spend such a large amount of money providing a luxury @entity166 ’s - style holiday camp for travellers in such lovely countryside			1
' there could be a minimum of between 80 and 100 gypsies and travellers at any time			2
some may be very pleasant and law abiding , but you will always get the few who are n’t			0
' they are only allowed to stay for 28 days so you ca n’t form a relationship with these people			0
if we get the odd ones that fight and get drunk and cause trouble it will be very intimidating			0
' mr @entity69 explained he was only given three minutes to voice his concerns on behalf of residents at the planning meeting			0
he added : ' i ’m going to talk to a lawyer to see if there is any way we can get compensation			0
' it is the direct action of @entity15 that has lost me nearly £ 100,000 and i ca n’t recover that cost			2
' this has totally ruined my retirement and retirement plans			2
i have n’t set a date for my retirement now because our dream was to go to our little idyllic comfortable country cottage in the fields of @entity10 and that ’s been shattered now			0
' building work on the site is due to go ahead in the near future since the passing of the final stage of the application			2
councillor @entity212 , head of housing and jobs for @entity15 who lives in the nearby town of @entity217 and was part of the applying team , said : ' we need a site somewhere in @entity222 as we have a lot of travellers in the area and have had a lot of unapproved sites where travellers have been and we have not been able to move them			1
' this is an approved site which we have investigated and compared with many others across the borough			1
it is very difficult to get these things sited and there has been plenty of public opposition			0
' i know there has been a lot of public angst and people have n’t liked it but i ’m afraid that is going to be the case wherever you would wish to put a transit site			2
' i do feel sorry for the nearby residents			0
i think if the site was on my doorstep it ’s just a case if wherever these things are sited it is bound to have opposition			2
' it would n’t matter whether it was next to my house or anyone ’s house			0
with the best will in the world we have to try and pick the best site possible			2
' it ’s just inevitable there is opposition and i ’m very sorry for those who have a problem with that			0
we are under a legal obligation to have site for travellers			1
