by @entity0 having increased security on phones is a comfort if it ’s lost or stolen - but having to add fingerprints , passwords and @entity6 does make accessing these devices a drawn - out process			2
thankfully , @entity9 appears to be working on a way to make this process a lot easier , without compromising on high security levels			0
the firm ’s latest patent reveals plans to add customisable security options , based on the user ’s location , meaning the phone would automatically unlock when in a ‘ safe ’ location			1
the @entity22 firm 's latest patent reveals plans to add customisable security options that could , based on a user 's location , automatically unlock a phone when the user is in a ' safe ' zone			1
for example , if the device is connected to the user 's home @entity30 ( pictured ) @entity9 is planning to put some muscle behind its future @entity35 - literally			1
the @entity37 - based company published a patent last month to use an ‘ artificial muscle system ’ for focusing cameras in devices such as its @entity35 and @entity43			0
the patent claims the system would contract in a similar way to how muscles move , to focus the lens and take images			0
the system could allow for much slimmer mobile systems that use less power while carrying larger camera components , the company said			0
for example , if the device is connected to the user ’s home @entity30 , or the network inside their office , the phone will not ask for the security code or fingerprint scan , and will keep the screen unlocked			1
additionally , the patent describes how the ' location ' does n't need to refer to a fixed location , and could also include a user 's car			2
to verify the location , the phone could connect to the car 's @entity70 , navigation systems or audio displays			0
alternatively , if the phone is on a mobile or public network , in a pub or café , security levels could be increased			1
this could add extra security levels , in addition to the pin , passcode or fingerprint scan			1
the patent , titled ‘ location - sensitive security levels and setting profiles based on detected location ’ was filed in december 2012 and awarded earlier this month			2
additionally , the patent describes how the location does not need to refer to a fixed place , and could also include a user 's car			2
to verify the location , the phone could connect to the car 's @entity70 , navigation systems or audio displays ( pictured ) alternatively , if the phone is on a public network , security levels will be increased , in addition to the pin , passcode or fingerprint scan ( scanner pictured )			1
the patent , titled ' location - sensitive security levels and setting profiles based on detected location ' was filed in december 2012 and awarded earlier this month ‘ to provide a reliably pleasant and secure experience for a user operating a mobile device , it can be desirable to modify security settings or other device behaviour based on a detected location , ’ explained the patent			1
‘ mobile devices often have security requirements , such as passwords or passcodes			0
‘ security requirements help ensure that a mobile device is in the hands of the appropriate party , [ but ] often the security level remains the same regardless of the location of the mobile device			0
‘ because some locations may be inherently more secure , such as a user 's home or office , these locations may be considered ‘ safe ’ and require less stringent security			1
‘ conversely , some locations may be considered higher risk or ‘ unsecure			0
’ in these locations , it can be desirable to implement stronger security protections			0
' as with all patents , this technology may not end up on a device .			0
