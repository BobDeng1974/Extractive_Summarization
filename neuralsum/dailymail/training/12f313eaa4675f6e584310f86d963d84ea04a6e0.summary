@entity11 , from @entity64 , @entity65 said : ‘ i was the laziest person i knew , i hated exercise and could never be bothered			1
‘ but with hypnocise it ’s really different , it puts all the thoughts and motivation into your mind and gets you ready to exercise			1
‘ it ’s crazy , i can feel my body preparing itself			0
i ’ll think about doing crunches and it will feel as if i ’ve already done some			0
gaining weight : after getting her first job and moving in with her friends at 19 - years - old , @entity11 began to pile on the pounds as she gorged on takeaways every night and drank alcohol every weekend ‘ it puts suggestions in your mind that you want to exercise and tells you how much better you will feel for it			1
‘ it sounds insane but it really works , my body shape has changed completely			2
‘ people think i ’m a gym nut or someone who goes on really long runs but all i do is half an hour to an hour each night at home			2

but @entity11 did n’t notice her changing figure until people started to make comments on her size - with an old friend even stopping her in the street to say she was worried about her health and overhearing men in clubs calling her ‘ fatty			1
’ @entity11 listens to the @entity106 before she works out which puts thoughts into her mind that she wants to get fit , motivated and feel like she has more energy - preparing her to work out			1
unaware : @entity11 did n't notice her changing figure until people started to make comments on her size - with an men in clubs calling her ' fatty '			1

@entity11 said : ' at the time i lived with my friends , when i started putting weight on , i was probably in my late teens			1
' i had a job and i had money for the first time and i lived on takeaways , all the worst kinds of food			2
' i would have breakfast and then a snack and then dinner and then i ’d snack through until tea , which would probably be a takeaway			0
it was always convenience food			0
' i was going through that time in your life when you suddenly have a job and money and i started to go out with my friends and drink			0
' i always used to feel like the ugly one but now i feel incredible ' ' it was all a novelty , it was all new and exciting			0
and the weight just slowly crept on			0
i just did n’t realise what was happening , i did n’t see it creeping on			0
' i did n’t realise at first and then people started to make comments when i was in my early 20s			0
i think the first one i really remember was when i bumped into an old school friend and she said she worried about me because of my size			2
' she was n’t being mean or anything , i do think she was genuinely concerned			0
i was putting my life at risk and in the end i realised something had to change			0
' my mum just made it so much easier for me because i found it hard to be motivated			0
now i love going out with my friends and showing off my figure			2
' i always used to feel like the ugly one but now i feel incredible			0
' @entity30 , who is using the technique with other clients , said : ' i was worried about @entity11 ’s fitness - her weight was reducing but she still was n’t anywhere near as fit as she should be			1
new woman : ' i always used to feel like the ugly one but now i feel incredible , ' she said after being hynotised into loving exercise ' the @entity167 helped her achieve her weight loss but i needed to get her motivated into exercising			2
' when i did her first @entity170 session i incorporated a short workout which we did together , then i repeated the same under hypnosis			1
' but i also inputted positive subliminal , motivational suggestions to encourage her to repeat this every day and enjoy it as well			2
' i put together a cd which took her through the workout under hypnosis - she then played this every day			2
' i have never seen anyone change so dramatically			0
i added other exercises and extended the length of the session so she could endure more			0
' now she does 30 to 60 minutes every day			2
she is fitter and more energetic than ever and looks fantastic and i am so proud her			0
