a devout @entity2 @entity1 couple , who have been married for 55 years , stumped the @entity3 this week when they gave a speech about the importance of sexual intimacy in marriage			1
@entity8 and @entity9 , from @entity10 in @entity12 's eastern suburbs , addressed more than 182 bishops and the @entity14 during the synod in which they spoke about the importance of family life and shared their belief that ' sexual intercourse ' is the fullest expression of marriage			1
' that attraction that we first felt and the continued bonding force between us was basically sexual , ' the chair - couple of the @entity1 @entity22 and @entity23 said in their speech			2
' gradually we came to see that the only feature that distinguishes our sacramental relationship from that of any other good @entity45 - centred relationship is sexual intimacy and that marriage is a sexual sacrament with its fullest expression in sexual intercourse			0
' the synod , which will be held over a fortnight , will see a total of 13 couples speak about their experiences in an effort to help the @entity57 approach the subjects of family with their modern day followers			1
following the @entity9 's speech , @entity64 cardinal , @entity61 told the @entity65 : ' that 's not what we bishops talk about mostly , quite honestly			2
' they were one of 13 couples invited to speak about their experiences in an effort to help the @entity57 approach the subjects of family with modern day @entity57 ' but to hear that as the opening contribution did , i think , open an area ... and it was a recognition that that is central to the well - being of marriage often			1
' but an unconcerned mr @entity81 told @entity82 that there was nothing controversial about his speech			0
' there was nothing we said that is not fully in keeping with the church 's teaching , ' he said			0
' in regard to sex it should be fairly obvious – were a married couple why else would you get married ? you want to be intimate with each other because you are in love and that leads to children and that 's what marriage is all about ; loving each other and wanting to spread that love			2
following the @entity9 's speech at the @entity3 ( pictured ) @entity64 cardinal , @entity61 admitted : ' that 's not what we bishops talk about mostly , quite honestly ' ' that attraction that we first felt and the continued bonding force between us was basically sexual , ' the couple said in their speech ' people seem surprised but it 's just common sense			1
it 's just natural and all of the bishops we 've spoken to are quite supportive and happy			0
' further along in their speech , the @entity121 also told the @entity3 of their @entity124 friends whose ' gay son said he wanted to bring his partner home ' to a @entity128 gathering			1
' they fully believed in the @entity57 's teachings and they knew their grandchildren would see them welcome the son and his partner into the family			1
their response could be summed up in three words , " he is our son "			0
' ' gradually we came to see that ... marriage is a sexual sacrament with its fullest expression in sexual intercourse , ' their speech said despite admitting that he and his wife were careful when wording the anecdote , mr @entity81 again insisted that the opinion their voiced was in keeping with the church 's teaching			2
' the general point we were making was in context of a broader point … the church is trying to promote clear values to society and so it has rules , regulations and doctrines – but the overarching thing about the church is that it must spread love			0
' how do you show love to a person and at the same time uphold a different values - this is something parents face all the time with their children			0
we do n't think parents should agree with everything their children want to do , they must uphold certain values but but most of all their children need to feel their love			0
