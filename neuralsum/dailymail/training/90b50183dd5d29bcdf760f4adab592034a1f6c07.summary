by @entity0 published : 11:17 est , 4 april 2013 updated : 11:55 est , 4 april 2013 @entity2 's shortest double yellow lines have appeared on a city 's street - measuring little over a foot long			1
two sets of double yellow lines measuring just 13 inches long apiece have been painted in between parking spaces on a residential road in @entity9			1
@entity10 say the lines , which beat the previous shortest double yellows by a good four inches , are to deter drivers from encroaching on disabled parking bays			1
the tiny 13 - inch double yellow lines have been painted between official parking spaces in @entity9 if motorists park on the new lines they will incur a £ 70 fine			1
but local residents say the new markings ' defy logic ' and are simple waste of time and taxpayers ' money			1
@entity28 , 51 , lives on @entity29 near @entity9 city centre , where the lines have been painted			1
she said : ' it 's the craziest set of double yellow lines i have ever seen			2
it just defies logic as to why they bothered painting them on the road			0
' her son @entity40 , 21 , who helped row @entity44 's reserve vessel @entity42 to victory in last weekend 's varsity boat race , added : ' it 's ridiculous			2
i have no idea why they have done that			0
you ca n't even fit a remote control car on it			0
' councillor @entity55 , a former mayor of @entity9 , also branded the new road markings ' rididulous ' , adding : ' perhaps a child with a toy car could park there , but nothing else could			1
' @entity62 said : ' this is common practice			0
' i think they 're cute ' : city councillor @entity66 hopes the lines will become a tourist attraction measuring little over a foot long , the new yellow lines are more fitting for toy cars than real ones ' the yellow lines are at either end of a disabled parking bay and are there to prevent vehicles parked either side from encroaching on the disabled bay			1
' councillor @entity66 said he hoped the lines would become an attraction for visitors			2
he said : ' i think they ’re cute and could be on the tourist trail			0
we should get the blue badge tour guides onto it			0
' the previous shortest double yellow line record was held by the city of @entity90 , where residents woke up to find a set just 17 inches long in @entity93 in 2011			0
council bosses also laid down 18 inch double yellow lines on parking bays in @entity97 , @entity98 , in 2007			2
and last year @entity100 in @entity99 painted double yellow lines measuring just 21 inches .			0

parking on the lines in @entity29 , @entity9 will mean a £ 70 fine
residents say the markings are a ' ridiculous ' waste of time and money
@entity10 says it 's *designed* to keep disabled bays free
