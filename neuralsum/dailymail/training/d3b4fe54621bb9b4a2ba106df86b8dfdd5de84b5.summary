by @entity0 published : 09:08 est , 12 march 2013 updated : 09:24 est , 12 march 2013 winning an @entity1 can add nearly three years to a actor 's life thanks to the opportunities it gives them to improve their careers , a new study claims			1
however the stress of being @entity11 president , on the other hand , shortens the lives of those who wriggle so far up the greasy pole of politics by as many as five years			1
researchers from @entity18 , @entity19 , investigated life 's winners and losers to see how success could be linked to mortality			1
difficult job : a new study claims that the stresses associated with being president , like @entity29 , can shorten a person 's life by as many as five years studies have long linked high socio - economic status with better health , but what has remained unclear is whether this is more to do with access to resources or the glow of higher social status relative to others			1
scholars call the latter ' relative deprivation			0
' a team led by dr @entity46 studied @entity48 inductees , @entity1 winners , and former presidents and vice presidents , comparing each to nominated losers in the same competition or election			1
they found no consistent advantages for winners			0
indeed , in some cases such as winning the presidential election , the victory robbed the winner of several years			0
dr @entity46 and his associates found the following effects of winning versus losing in the three groups : ' the relative deprivation theory would predict that losers would consistently be at a disadvantage for health and longevity compared to winners , but this is not what we see , ' said dr link , a professor of @entity75			2
a more likely explanation , he notes , is that the advantages and disadvantages of winning depend on the mix of opportunities and stresses that they bring			0
homeland actor @entity82 brandishes his @entity1 in september last year : winning an emmy can add nearly three years to a actor 's life thanks to the opportunities it gives them to improve their careers , the study claims winning an @entity1 often leads to significant career opportunities that might not have been otherwise available			1
the paper quotes actor @entity93 saying , ' there 's no doubt that having an @entity1 precedes you through the door			0
' on the other hand , @entity48 induction occurs after playing careers are over and therefore has little bearing on career opportunities and earnings			2
as for presidential and vice presidential candidates , life circumstances do change for members of this elite club , but winning also brings significant risks : assassination threats and extreme stress from two of the world 's most demanding jobs			1
the 15 men who led the @entity11 during the 20th century but died by the year 2008 lived an average of 1.9 years less than the average @entity11 male of the same age			2
' our findings provide an important correction to an overemphasis on relative deprivation as an explanation of health inequalities , ' said dr link			0
' relative deprivation likely plays some role in health inequalities , but it is not as important as the life circumstances and opportunities that result from one 's socioeconomic position			0
' findings are published online in the @entity136 and will appear in the april 2013 print edition .			0

researchers investigated how success was linked to mortality
previous studies have linked high socio - economic status with longer life
winning an emmy helps actors to have better , more successful careers
however , being president comes with stress that takes a toll
emmy - winning actors **enjoyed** *2.7* more years of life than nominees who did not snag the *trophy* . though emmy - winning *screenwriters* were , *mysteriously* , at a three - year disadvantage .
@entity48 **enjoyed** no advantage in longevity over *non-inducted* nominees .
presidents and vice presidents lose , on average , *5.3* years from their lives compared to the candidates they *bested* . while some of this is *due* to the impact of assassination , the disadvantage persists even when assassination is taken out of the equation .
