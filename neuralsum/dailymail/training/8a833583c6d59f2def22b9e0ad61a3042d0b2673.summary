by @entity0 published : 03:05 est , 28 november 2012 updated : 05:05 est , 28 november 2012 deadly : a leaked diagram suggests that @entity3 scientists have carried out computer tests for a nuclear weapon three times as powerful as that which destroyed @entity9 , pictured scientists in @entity3 could be producing a nuclear weapon three times as powerful as that which destroyed @entity9 during the @entity15 , according to a leaked diagram			1
the diagram , which suggests that experts have run computer simulations for the weapon , was released by an unnamed country which is opposed to @entity3 's atomic programme and wishes to boost its view that it should be brought to a halt before a weapon can be produced			1
the graph - which shows a bell curve with variables of time , power and energy - shows that the weapon would have a force of around 50 kilotons two microseconds after detonation			0
in comparison , the bomb that the @entity36 dropped on the @entity38 city of @entity9 which killed around 140,000 people in 1945 had a force of about 15 kilotons			0
modern nuclear weapons have yields hundreds of times higher than that			0
the @entity46 — the @entity49 - based @entity48 nuclear watchdog — reported last year that it had obtained diagrams indicating that @entity3 was calculating the ' nuclear explosive yield ' of potential weapons but did not give details of what the diagrams showed			1
the diagram , obtained by news agency @entity57 , had the number five as part of its title , suggesting that it is one of a series			0
@entity65 , whose @entity66 is used by the @entity36 government as a go - to source on @entity3 's nuclear program , said the diagram looks genuine but seems to be designed more ' to understand the process ' than as part of a blueprint for an actual weapon in the making			1
he added that the power of the weapon is too big , noting that @entity79 's first tests of a nuclear device were only a few kilotons			1
because the graph appears to be only one in a series , others might show lower yields , closer to what a test explosion might produce , he said			0
the senior diplomat said the diagram was part of a series of @entity3 computer - generated models provided to the @entity46 by the intelligence services of member nations for use in its investigations into suspicions that @entity3 is trying to produce a nuclear weapon			1
@entity3 denies any interest in such a weapon and has accused the @entity36 and @entity101 of fabricating evidence that suggests it is trying to build a bomb			1
computer tests : the undated diagram shows a force more than three times greater than the atomic bomb which devastated the @entity110 city of @entity9 in 1945 asked about the project , @entity3 's chief @entity46 delegate , @entity112 , said he had not heard of it			1
@entity46 spokeswoman @entity114 said the agency had no comment			0
@entity3 has refused to halt uranium enrichment , despite offers of reactor fuel from abroad , saying it is producing nuclear fuel for civilian uses			1
it has refused for years to cooperate with the @entity48 nuclear agency 's efforts to investigate its program			0
@entity3 's critics fear it could use the enriched uranium for military purposes			2
such concerns grew this month when the @entity46 said @entity3 is poised to double its output of higher - enriched uranium at its fortified underground facility — a development that could put @entity133 within months of being able to make the core of a nuclear warhead			2
in reporting on the existence of the diagrams last year , the @entity46 said it had obtained them from two member nations that it did not identify			0
other diplomats have said that @entity101 and the @entity36 — the countries most concerned about @entity3 's nuclear program — have supplied the bulk of intelligence being used by the @entity46 in its investigation			2
' the application of such studies to anything other than a nuclear explosive is unclear to the agency , ' the @entity46 said at the time			0
devastation : some 140,000 people died when the @entity36 dropped an atom bomb on @entity9 in 1945 the models were allegedly created in 2008 and 2009 — well after 2003 , the year that the @entity36 said @entity133 had suspended such work in any meaningful way			0
that date has been questioned by @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 and @entity101 , and the @entity46 now believes that — while @entity3 shut down some of its work back then — other tests and experiments continue today			2
with both the @entity46 probe and international attempts to engage @entity3 stalled , there are fears that @entity101 may opt to strike at @entity133 's nuclear program			2
the jewish state insists it will not tolerate an @entity3 armed with nuclear arms			2
an intelligence summary provided with the drawing linked it to other alleged nuclear weapons work — significant because it would indicate that @entity3 is working not on isolated experiments , but rather on a single program aimed at mastering all aspects of nuclear arms development			2
nuclear : @entity3 's president @entity181 watches from a control room as nuclear fuel rods are loaded into a research reactor in @entity133 earlier this year			2
the country says it is producing nuclear energy for civilian use the @entity46 suspects that @entity3 has conducted live tests of conventional explosives that could be used to detonate a nuclear weapon at @entity191 , a sprawling military base southeast of @entity133			1
an intelligence summary said data gained from those tests fed the model plotted in the diagram			0
@entity3 has repeatedly turned down @entity46 requests to visit the site , which the agency fears is undergoing a major cleanup meant to eliminate any traces of such experiments			0
meanwhile , a new satellite picture shows that activity at a missile launch site in @entity79 has stepped up a gear , suggesting that long range ballistic missiles could be tested in the next few weeks			1
the image , which shows the @entity210 , was released by satellite operator @entity211 days after @entity110 newspaper the @entity212 claimed that @entity36 intelligence were aware of moves seen as preparation by @entity79 to launch a long range missile as early as this month			1
it shows more tents , people , equipment and trucks at the site , similar to when preparations were being made for a failed rocket launch back in april			0
ready to launch : a satellite image shows increased activity at a missile launch site in @entity79 , suggesting that the country will test long range ballistic missiles in the coming weeks a @entity233 spokeswoman declined to comment on the reported satellite images , but said the @entity233 's position on @entity79 's missile development efforts had not changed			1
she urged @entity79 to comply with @entity238 resolutions that ' require @entity239 to suspend all activities related to its ballistic missile program in a complete , verifiable , and irreversible manner , and re-establish its moratorium on missile launching			1
' the country , which carried out nuclear tests in 2006 and 2009 and is under heavy @entity48 sanctions for its atomic weapons program , has tried for years to influence major events in @entity252 by waging propaganda or armed attacks			0
@entity255 have been technically at war since their 1950 - 53 conflict ended in a truce , not a peace treaty , and regional powers have for years been trying to rein in the @entity255 's nuclear program			0
@entity79 is believed to be developing a long - range ballistic missile with a range of up to 4,200 miles aimed at hitting the continental @entity36 but the last two rocket test launches failed			1
in april , under its new leader @entity266 , @entity79 launched a rocket that flew just a few minutes covering a little over 60 miles before crashing into the sea between @entity252 and @entity269 .			0

a leaked diagram suggests that @entity3 scientists have run computer simulations for a weapon
@entity3 has *previously* denied any interest in such a weapon
meanwhile , satellite images from @entity79 suggest that the nation could be about to test long range ballistic missiles
