by @entity0 created : 08:26 est , 6 february 2014 with its palatial interior , grand @entity4 features and rustic views over the @entity6 , @entity8 ’s £ 1.25million apartment was the embodiment of good taste and propriety			1
unfortunately , the same could not quite be said for its owner			0
for after an unseemly row with a wealthy neighbour in the 17th century stately home , @entity14 sent her an email telling her to ‘ go hang yourself ’			1
evicted : @entity8 was thrown out of the 17th century @entity20 after she sent a ' disturbing and distressing ' email to the head of the residents ' committee			1

the imposing @entity20 , nestled in the rolling countryside near @entity36 in @entity37 , is split into 12 luxury flats and all residents have to pay monthly service charges			1
prosecutor @entity40 said @entity14 , who was made bankrupt in 2010 , struggled to get on with neighbours , had been taken to court by the residents ’ committee over the money she owed and was given a harassment warning in september 2012 ordering her to have no contact with mrs @entity30			1
but in november last year , the former @entity48 air hostess sent mrs @entity30 , a jeweller , an obscene email , including the line : ‘ my only other suggestion is that you go and hang yourself but with your own low iq you could n’t manage that either			1
’ luxury : the property , which includes an @entity4 salon with 24ft - high ceilings , a kitchen and two bedrooms , was put on the market for £ 1.25million , but it has struggled to sell mother - of - two @entity14 pleaded guilty to sending an email that was grossly offensive or of an indecent , obscene or menacing character at @entity67 ’ @entity68 on wednesday			1

@entity76 , defending , said that @entity14 had been ‘ under strain ’ and was being evicted for defaulting on her mortgage repayments			2
he added : ‘ it is not a nice email			0
she wrote as a 15 - year - old rather than a 50 - year - old			0
things have settled down now			0
’ @entity14 ’s eviction marks the end of her dream of living in the opulent surroundings @entity20 has to offer			1
approached via a three - quarter - of - a - mile private drive , it was built by the @entity93 family , who rose from obscurity – along with many @entity96 families – under @entity97 when @entity14 bought her two - bedroom , 3,000 sq ft flat for £ 237,000 in 1999 , it was dilapidated and run - down , and she poured thousands of pounds into restoring it			1
disputes : prosecutor @entity40 told @entity68 that @entity14 struggled to get on with neighbours at the 17th century mansion but it already boasted many impressive features , including an @entity110 salon with 24ft - high ceilings and massive original fireplace			1
the plaster decoration on the wall dates from @entity116 ’s reign , while the ceiling itself was a gift from @entity120 in recognition of the @entity93 family ’s loyalty throughout the @entity124			0
but @entity14 began to struggle to keep up with the running costs of the flat , which came to around £ 4,000 a year , including £ 120 - a - month service charges and £ 2,000 council tax			1
she put the flat on the market for £ 1.25million in 2009			1
in an interview with the @entity138 at the time , @entity14 , who makes her living selling @entity133 luxury goods to supermarkets in her native @entity135 , said : ‘ i want the money			2
and i want to downsize to somewhere more cosy and less grand			0
’ the interview was accompanied by a photograph of her perched on a white sofa in the spectacular salon with her young children			0
however , she failed to find a buyer , and was forced to remortgage the property until she was made bankrupt			2
yesterday , neighbours said they were relieved @entity14 had gone			2
budget : @entity14 bought the dilapidated apartment for just £ 237,000 in 1999 when she came to @entity37 to buy up high - end businesses which she then sold back to wealthy @entity135 one said : ‘ she was a nightmare			2
people living here have a certain expectation of lifestyle and she could n’t accept that her personal circumstances meant she was living beyond her means			0
‘ it was a sad way to end her time here but it ’s not right to lash out at fellow neighbours just because they ask for money which is rightly owed			0
’ @entity168 , 69 , who has lived in the house since 1953 when her father bought one of the first apartments , said : ‘ people are relieved she has finally gone			0
the flat is empty now			0
’ and another former neighbour said the other residents may even celebrate @entity14 ’s departure with a party			0
she said : ‘ we are mightily relieved and we will no doubt be having a little farewell party in her honour – which she most certainly is not invited to			0
