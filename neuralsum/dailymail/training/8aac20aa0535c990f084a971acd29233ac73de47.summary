by @entity0 and @entity1 last updated at 9:46 pm on 5th september 2011 his opponents will testify to his seemingly super-human fitness levels , but @entity5 has shown that his body is fallible with a dramatic collapse during a press conference at the @entity9			1
very publicly and without warning , he went into seizure while answering questions in his post-match interview , and while there is no lasting damage the incident vividly showed the physical demands of professional sport			1
@entity5 was answering questions after his victory in the third round of the @entity22			1
suddenly , the 25 - year - old clutched at his right leg and then put his hands to his head as his discomfort grew with the threat that he could go into full body spasm			1
the room was cleared as a physio and doctor were swiftly sought and , within minutes of being given the correct stretches and liquids he was walking around as if nothing had happened			1
a similar thing happened to @entity46 no 1 @entity47 's opponent @entity47 on court last week and , again , while that looked dramatic it was quickly remedied			1
a grinning @entity5 , who went on to do his round of tv interviews , made light of the whole episode , saying : ' it was just unfortunate that it happened in the front and back of my leg at once ' it 's just bad luck that it happened in public			1
it was really hot , i ran a lot and you sweat a lot in these conditions			1
' concern : @entity5 later returned to announce he felt cramp in his thigh as the cramp takes hold @entity5 heads for the floor going , going , gone : @entity5 slides under the desk @entity76 thought it was not that unusual an occurrence			1
' i do n't think it 's odd that someone 's cramping , ' he said			1
' i 'm sure a lot of people were surprised because it was him that was cramping , but @entity5 's human			2
i think some people forget that sometimes			2
' i think around midday loads of people were struggling with the heat			2
he very rarely plays that early			2
' so if you mess up like your eating or get it wrong or you 're drinking wrong before the match - and from the parts of the match i saw today he did quite a lot of running , as well - you can get yourself in a bad way in these conditions			2
' i 'm glad he 's all right , but i 'm sure it was a bit of a shock for him			2
' pleasure and pain : @entity5 celebrates his victory against @entity109 before succumbing to the pain of cramp in the post-match interview @entity113 also played down @entity5 's drama , saying : ' not to put a dampener on the story , which i know you guys think is really big , but people cramp after matches when you 're cold			0
it 's just something that happens			0
' it 's just unfortunate it happened in front of you all			0
every single player in there has had that happen before			0
' what we do , we run around , run miles and miles and miles and miles on the tennis court in nasty weather			0
you throw nerves in there , i mean , it happens			0
as long as it does n't happen during a match , you 're fine			0
' i heard about it			0
they were telling me it was like this whole thing and people were surrounding him			0
i saw @entity5 and he was laughing about it later on			0
' watch the video &amp; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; lt ; br / &amp; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; gt ;			0
