perhaps it ’s because many of us watched the @entity5 classic @entity6 as a child that we all seem to have a special place in our hearts for elephants , especially baby ones			2
that ’s what makes this latest video from elephant research and conservation project @entity15 for elephants - which has now started to trend on the internet - so special			1
an eight - month - old calf became stuck in a shallow well in the parched grounds of @entity24 national park in @entity25 - while its increasingly anxious mother , @entity26 , looked on , powerless to help			1
the rescue operation began early in the morning - before the mother would have been forced to leave by herders who would soon arrive to water their cattle			2
at first , the team struggled to attach a rope around the calf in the 5ft - deep hole as the low - lying water caused the cord to float to the surface			2
finally , they managed to secure it and , with the other end of the rope attached to a jeep , hauled the animal to safety			0
helping hand : one of the rescuers tries to assist the baby elephant luckily , the @entity62 got word of the incident in the @entity39 earlier this week and sent two jeeps to assist at first , the team struggled to attach a rope around the calf as the low - lying water caused the cord to float to the surface finally , they managed to secure it and , with the other end of the rope attached to a jeep , hauled the animal to safety what followed was truly tearjerking			1
the calf thundered across the barren plain , leaving a trail of dust in its wake			0
in the distance , the cries of @entity81 could be heard as she came running in the opposite direction			0
and then they were reunited , embracing each other with their trunks			0
they then turned to the camera , perhaps as a sign of gratitude to the little one 's saviours			0
watch the full film here : @entity96 # ! after it was free , the calf thundered across the barren plain in the distance , the cries of @entity81 could be heard as she came running in the opposite direction and then @entity26 , her partner and calf were reunited , embracing each other with their trunks members of the @entity15 were all smiles after releasing the baby elephant			1
