@entity0 down : a new documentary has heard from @entity3 agents who have revealed how @entity5 mobster @entity4 was finally captured thanks to a stray cat and a boob job for 14 years , @entity12 's most - wanted criminal @entity11 ' @entity4 and his moll @entity9 evaded capture by posing as any other elderly couple in a low - key suburb of @entity16			1
now the @entity3 has revealed for the first time how the pair were finally tracked down when two vastly different pieces of the jigsaw came together to out them - her love of a stray cat and her vanity as a younger woman when she opted for a boob job			1
@entity4 , a notorious @entity5 underworld kingpin was jailed for life earlier this month after a 40 - year career of murder , extortion , money - laundering , arms trafficking and drug dealing			1
the 84 - year - old was arrested in 2011 after years on the run at the apartment he shared with @entity40 in @entity41 , where residents told how the couple blended in like all the other retired couples			1
speaking to 60 minutes on @entity45 , neighbour @entity46 remembered how @entity40 always fed a stray cat after its owner had died			1
she said : ' she would pet it , you know , and be sweet to it and she put a plate of food like out here			0
' @entity4 had been a great source of embarrassment for the @entity3 after he had infiltrated the @entity5 office of the bureau and bought off agents who protected him			1
they gave him the tip that allowed @entity4 to flee just days before he was to be indicted in 1995			2
some feared he would never been caught			0
the film heard from @entity3 agents who told how they had struggled to find a workable lead for ten years - nor did they have any good photographs of the pair			1
they were aware of the couple 's love of animals , but appeals to veterinarians proved unsuccessful			0
there had also been reports that @entity40 had once had breast implants and other plastic surgery in @entity5 before they fled the city , and , grasping at straws , they turned to cosmetics surgeons in the hope of a clue			1
posing as any other retired couple : @entity84 spent 16 years on the run with his girlfriend @entity9 ( pictured together here in an undated photo ) spotted : @entity40 and @entity4 were captured in 2011 in their then - apartment in @entity41 , @entity91 to their astonishment , one came from dr @entity94 , who not only found her file in storage - but crucially , photographs			1
agent @entity99 , who joined the @entity100 in 2009 , told the programme called the @entity102 : ' i was trying to leave the office a little early to catch one of my kids ' ballgames			0
' and i said , " well , listen - i 'm gon na swing by in the morning and pick those up			0
" ' and they said to me - " do you want the photos too ? " ' and i said " you have photos ? " and they said , " yeah , we have photos			0
" @entity115 said , " we 'll be there in 15 minutes			0
" ' armed with the picture , the @entity3 decided to switch strategy to focus on finding @entity40 and created public service announcements on daytime talk shows aimed at women			2
then they got a call from a neighbour			2
deputy @entity125 @entity124 , who took the lead , said : ' the tipster specifically described that they were caring for this cat and their love for this cat			0
' so that was just one piece of the puzzle on the tip that added up to saying " if this is n’t them it ’s something we better check out immediately because it sure sounds like them			0
" ' @entity4 disappeared in 1995 as law enforcement agencies were about to arrest him when officers closed in , more than $ 822,000 and 30 guns were found hidden in the walls of the couple ’s rent - controlled apartment , where they had been living there under assumed identities with @entity40 running errands , buying her aging lover ’s medication and paying bills			2
@entity4 was sentenced to life in prison earlier this month for his murderous reign of terror in the 1970s and ' 80s , bringing to a close a case that exposed @entity3 corruption so deep that many people across the city thought he would never be brought to justice			1
he was defiant to the end , calling his trial on racketeering charges a sham and refusing to testify or provide information to probation officials preparing a sentencing report for the judge			0
the jury convicted @entity4 in 11 of the 19 killings he was charged with participating in , but acquitted him of seven and could not reach a conclusion on an eighth			0
@entity40 was sentenced separately to eight years for aiding and abetting him .			2

@entity5 crime lord tracked down in @entity16 suburb after 16 years on the run
@entity184 noticed how his moll @entity9 always fed an alley cat
@entity3 contacted cosmetic surgeons after reports that she had implants
one physician rang to say he had her file and , crucially , her photographs
a public appeal focussing on @entity40 then yielded call from a neighbour
