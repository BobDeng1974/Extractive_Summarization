when the ‘ comet of the century ’ @entity3 swung perilously close to the sun last month , scientists were left stumped as to whether it had survived			1
most astronomers now believe that the comet was destroyed by solar heat with @entity8 stating a 90 per cent chance of this having happened			1
what they believe now remains from its original 0.62 mile ( 1km ) nucleus are 10 metre pieces of rubble			0
click on the bottom right of this image to enlarge ... @entity8 said that it will monitor @entity3 for the next several weeks to see if anything has survived			1
its @entity20 spacecraft will be using its cameras to search for bright fragments throughout the week , while the @entity23 ( @entity23 ) in @entity24 , @entity25 will use its 3m wide telescope there is , however , a 10 per cent chance of it having left behind some important fragments 100 metres in radius or larger which will be big enough to study			1
@entity8 said that it will monitor the comet for the next few weeks			2
the group ’s stereo spacecraft will be using their cameras to search for bright fragments throughout the week , along with the @entity23 ( @entity23 ) in @entity24			1
@entity8 's recently launched @entity38 spacecraft may try to observe @entity3 next week			1
shortly afterwards bright lights ( pictured top left ) were spotted that some scientists have claimed could be the comet 's nucleus in this frame grab taken from an enhanced video made by @entity8 's @entity20 - a spacecraft , comet @entity3 , left , approaches the sun on november 25 by mid-to - late december @entity54 and @entity55 observatories will be performing deep outer space searches for any remnants of the comet			1
@entity59 will also look for @entity3 in early 2014			2
if there is nothing sizable and stable left , it will dissipate and disappear in this time , as already emitted dust leaves the vicinity			0
if there is still a central source of emission , even if it is very much smaller , we will see a new , much fainter coma and tail form , which currently may be overwhelmed by the dust emitted from before the disruption event			0
‘ i believe that we will no longer see a brilliant display of @entity3 , ’ @entity74 , @entity76 ’s @entity75 told @entity77			1
some scientists feared the delicate comet ( pictured , bottom right , as it approached the sun ) had already started to disintegrate , even before it grazed the ' surface ' of the sun , 1.2 million kilometres away @entity3 headed towards the centre of our @entity87 in novermber passing within 1.2 million miles of the @entity89 ’s surface			2
at the time of discovery in september 2012 , @entity3 was over 584 million miles from the @entity89 its average speed in july was 55,405mph			2
it continued to accelerate steadily until november when it whipped around the @entity89 at an astonishing 425,000mph			0
early data analysis suggested @entity3 ’s size to be around three miles in diameter			2
most astronomers now believe that the comet was destroyed by solar heat with @entity8 stating a 90 per cent probability of this having happened			1
what they believe remains now is a small pieces of rubble , around 10 metres in radius			0
there is , however a 10 per cent change of it having left behind some important fragments 100m radius or larger which will be big enough to study			1
‘ if one looks at the pre and post perihelion observations by @entity76 ’s @entity114 the comet must have disintegrated			1
‘ the display it shows after closest approach to the sun , shows dust that was released pre-perihelion and a lot of fresh material that must have been set free during the close passage at the sun. ’ if previous sun grazing comets are any guides , there may be a sizeable piece of comet nucleus left			1
at this point , though , scientists are waiting for a variety of telescopes to make observations before the status of @entity3 can be confirmed			2
what remains of @entity3 appears to brighten and spread out , then fade			0
the disappearance of a strong central brightness condensation after perihelion is telling , the comet is clearly fainter and more diffuse going out than going in , but it continues to shine			0
the spread out light is likely due to dust emitted in the few hours before perihelion going around the sun. here , @entity3 is shown entering the field of view of the @entity76 and @entity8 's @entity114 on november 27			1
in this picture , called a coronagraph , the bright light of the sun itself is blocked so the structures around it are visible			0
the comet is seen in the lower right of this image @entity3 , which has been dubbed the ' comet of the century ' , was visible to the naked eye in november ‘ the fan - shape of the tail is a great example how the dust now moves on slightly different trajectories as compared to the nucleus , ’ added dr @entity74			1
‘ small dust grains experience radiation pressure and therefore see a reduced gravitational attraction by the @entity89 ( both forces act radially ) and depending upon the material and size the radiation pressure force varies			0
‘ for submicron highly absorbing grains and porous grains , this force can be even larger than the gravity and they are blown away from the sun. a composite image from the @entity182 's @entity181 telescope in @entity183 shows @entity3 streaking toward the sun on nov. 15			1
the image combines four different 30 - second exposures of the moving comet in different wavelengths ‘ as the brightness fades , i believe the source is gone			0
perhaps there is a fairly big junk left , but depleted of volatiles			0
these are really difficult to detect			0
’ the comet was believed to be straight from the @entity197 cloud on the fringes of the solar system , which is home to countless icy bodies - most notably the frozen balls of dust and gas in orbit around the sun known as comets			0
for whatever reason , @entity3 was propelled out of this cloud and drawn toward the heart of the solar system by the sun 's intense gravitational pull			2
by the time @entity3 slingshot around the sun , it was be moving at 828,000 mph ( 1,332,000 kph )			0
@entity3 is named after the @entity215 , used by a pair of @entity218 astronomers to detect the comet in september 2012 , but it officially is known as @entity3 , which indicates when it was discovered			0
@entity3 is named after the @entity215 , used by a pair of @entity218 astronomers to detect the comet in september 2012 , but it officially is known as c / 2012 @entity223			0

there is a 90 per cent probability that @entity3 was destroyed in november
but there is a slim chance it left pieces that will be large enough to study
@entity8 's stereo spacecraft will search for bright @entity3 fragments this week
its recently launched @entity38 spacecraft may observe @entity3 next week
