this is the shocking moment a mother left her baby in its pram and made a vicious racist attack on a total stranger			1
serial thug @entity6 , 26 , was only yards away from her daughters , aged four months and eight years , when she shouted abuse at a passer - by			1
as her boyfriend joined in and punched the victim to the ground , @entity9 repeatedly stamped on the man ’s head before returning to her children , miming a punch and a kick to show what she had done			2
judge @entity32 , @entity33 , told her : ‘ kids who have mothers who behave like you end up behaving like you			0
that damage starts from when they are tiny			0
’ but despite the fact it was a fourth conviction for assault in six years for @entity9 – who is now pregnant again – the judge spared her a prison sentence for the sake of those children			1
walked free : @entity9 's conviction is her fourth conviction in six years that meant that despite a string of convictions between them , @entity9 ’s boyfriend and cousin , who also intervened , had to be freed as well because they had admitted less serious offences			1
@entity9 had been drinking with @entity58 , father of her unborn child , and @entity62 in @entity63 in the centre of @entity65 this may when the attack took place , the city ’s @entity56 heard			1
the area was crowded with families enjoying the evening sunshine as @entity71 walked through on his way home from work			0
without provocation , @entity9 shouted racist abuse at him and added : ‘ you ’re a terrorist , do n’t come near me , i ’m worried you ’ll blow me up ’ and ‘ go back to @entity79 ’			2
he responded by telling 26 - year - old @entity80 to ‘ control his woman ’ , but @entity80 reacted by punching mr @entity71 to the ground , joined by @entity62 , 21			1
@entity25 footage shows @entity9 leaving her eight - year - old daughter , along with the pram with her baby in , and enthusiastically joining in the assault			1
she is seen repeatedly kicking mr @entity71 ’s head and stamping on it in front of witnesses			0
he suffered cuts and bruises			0
after the fight was broken up @entity9 appeared ‘ thrilled ’ by what she had done and threw a pretend punch , the court heard			2
as they left the square @entity9 was seen miming a kick			2
seconds later the three were arrested			0
between them they had 21 previous convictions , the court heard , many for violence			1
members of the public watch as @entity6 continues to attack mr @entity71 in @entity63 , @entity65 by this point mr @entity71 had been kicked to the ground as @entity9 stamped on his head			1
a passer - by was unable to stop the assault mr @entity71 's shocked face can be seen as @entity6 , now pregnant with her third child , continues her unprovoked attack the footage , released by the @entity120 , shows the assault which took place on may 21 this year in @entity122 @entity9 appears to recreate the attack for the benefit of a friend as she pushes her four - month - old baby girl in her pram @entity9 , pictured chatting to friends after the attack , was arrested with her baby 's father @entity58 and cousin @entity62 shortly after the attack dressing gown : @entity9 answers the door at her home @entity9 , who has a criminal record dating from when she was 17 including assaults and disorderly behaviour , admitted racially aggravated assault occasioning bodily harm			1
@entity58 , who was last year given a restraining order over a domestic violence offence , and @entity62 , who in 2009 was convicted of assaulting a police officer , both admitted a single charge of actual bodily harm			1
judge @entity32 told @entity9 : ‘ the damage you are doing to your children – there at the time and seeing you drunk , the risk you put them at – is disgraceful			2
she was in that state in charge of two children			0
' that in itself is a criminal offence , drunk in charge of a child			0
how irresponsible can you get ? you could easily have been dealing with a care case here			0
’ but she said the ‘ enormous impact ’ that jailing @entity9 would have on her children meant it was unfair to lock her up			2
@entity9 and @entity58 , both of @entity172 , @entity65 , were given 12 - month jail sentences , suspended for two years , and two - year supervision orders			1
@entity9 was ordered to attend a ‘ women ’s programme ’ while @entity80 was sent on a course for ‘ violent , angry , impulsive drinkers ’			0
@entity62 , of @entity178 , said to have been ‘ fleetingly ’ involved by punching mr @entity71 before retreating , was given the same sentence			0
