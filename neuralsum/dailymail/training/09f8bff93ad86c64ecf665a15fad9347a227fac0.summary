the @entity0 has released four new videos showing the latest attacks made by a @entity5 / @entity4 coalition against @entity7 militants			1
the footage , which was posted to @entity0 's @entity10 account , shows missiles destroying vehicles and buildings used by the terror group in both @entity15 and @entity16			1
in one clip a tank driven by the militants is seen being destroyed , while in another a small vehicle explodes into flames having suffered a direct hit			1
both attacks took place on roads in @entity16			2
elsewhere a missile is filmed slamming into an @entity28 - held building near the @entity15 border town @entity30 , and a weapons storage facility also in @entity15 is seen being destroyed			1
before : a car driven by @entity28 militants is filmed being driven along a road in @entity16 and after : seconds later the vehicle is destroyed due to a direct hit from an @entity5 missile @entity39 : a tank belonging to the @entity7 terrorist group is seen crossing an area of grassland in @entity16 blast : the tank explodes into flames after an @entity5 jet destroys it with a missile @entity0 has so - far released more than 20 videos of attacks against @entity28 and other militant groups in the @entity15 and @entity16			1
it has also released footage of rescue and aid operations in the region			1
the release of the videos comes as it was claimed @entity28 militants are withdrawing into smaller bases and leaving @entity61 to avoid being killed by @entity63 forces			1
international observers and witnesses have claimed the jihadists - whose aggressive presence on social media was until now part of their campaign of fear - appear to be turning more wary to avoid being tracked down and destroyed			1
the claims were made ahead of @entity74 jets hitting another @entity7 target in @entity16 yesterday , as calls grow for the attacks to be extended into the group 's strongholds in @entity15			1
locked on : an @entity5 fighter jet identified this building as a weapons storage facility in @entity15 taken out : despite filming from a great height , it is clear the jet 's missile destroyed the weapons facility , due to the large clouds of black smoke attack : in this shot a missile is seen slamming into an @entity28 - held building near the @entity15 border town @entity30 hit : the explosion caused by the blast at the @entity28 - held building sent a large fireball high into the air @entity99 , a visiting fellow at the @entity100 in @entity101 , said @entity28 appeared to have imposed a ' total social media and electronic blackout ' on its own fighters			1
a message in @entity107 , apparently banning militants from taking photographs during battle , was circulated on @entity61 with the @entity107 hashtag @entity111 after the @entity74 @entity113 overwhelmingly voted to join @entity5 air strikes			2
mr @entity99 told @entity115 the message appeared to be genuine , and ' gained solid traction across the is and pro-islamic state camps shortly after being published '			0
he added : ' if it is indeed genuine , it 's symbolic of the pressure that is has been placed under in recent weeks '			0
@entity74 experts have run voice recognition tests on propaganda videos such as those of the ' executioner ' @entity127 , and it is thought militants want to give agents as few clues as possible as to their identity or whereabouts			1
militants : @entity28 terrorists control vast swaths of territory in northern @entity15 and western @entity16 destroyed : people gather at the site of a car bomb attack in a @entity142 neighbourhood in southeastern @entity143 this morning			1
@entity145 militants loyal to @entity28 are fighting against the @entity142 rubble : children gather at the site of the car bomb attack in a @entity142 neighbourhood in southeastern @entity143 reports from @entity16 also suggest @entity28 are switching to a more low - key operation on the ground - switching convoys for motorcycles , using phones less and hoisting their black flag on empty houses to confuse jet pilots			1
an unnamed tribal sheikh who lives near @entity159 , northern @entity16 , told the @entity161 news agency @entity28 had ' abandoned one of their biggest headquarters ' in his village			2
' they took all their furniture , vehicles and weapons , ' he said on the day @entity74 air strikes were approved			2
' then they planted roadside bombs and destroyed the headquarters			2
' they do n't move in military convoys like before			0
instead they use motorcycles , bicycles , and if necessary , they use camouflaged cars			0

@entity194 forces have been locked in fierce clashes with @entity7 militants in and around @entity201 since the extremist group launched an assault in mid-september			0
the fighting has created one of the single largest exoduses in @entity15 's civil war , with more than 160,000 people fleeing into @entity208 , @entity244 humanitarian chief @entity243 said yesterday			0
@entity194 fighters brandish their automatic rifles in @entity201 : fighting for the town has continued for several weeks , with dozens of @entity7 militants and @entity194 fighters killed in recent days alone			2
