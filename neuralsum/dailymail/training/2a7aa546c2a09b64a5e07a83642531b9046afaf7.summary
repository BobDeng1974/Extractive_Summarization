by @entity0 published : 04:44 est , 1 october 2012 updated : 09:14 est , 1 october 2012 starving scavengers forced to the brink by the recession are targeting sheep in a remote beauty spot and butchering them in fields for their meat , livestock protection officers fear			1
experts have reported that animals are being dismembered on @entity12 , @entity13 - or stolen alive to be killed later			1
@entity14 , @entity15 , said : ' we ’ve found sheep where joints like the leg and shoulder have been carefully cut away			1
they ’re the sort of joints you ’d have in a roast dinner			1
in danger : experts have reported that sheep are being dismembered on @entity12 , @entity13 - or stolen alive to be killed later ' i saw another killed which had all its legs removed			1
' i do n’t know where this is going - but there are people out there who will do this for the meat			0
' she said people in nearby @entity39 have also reported waking up and finding sheep in their back garden			2
gory : @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity43 found carcasses with joints , such as the leg and shoulder , carefully cut away - ' the sort of joints you ¿ d have in a roast dinner ' ' we think they ’ve been taken home so that people can butcher them there - and then have lost heart and do n’t fancy doing it - or the sheep are getting away , ' said mrs @entity14			1
' maybe it ’s because times are hard			0
' it ’s very worrying - we will watch this space			0
' the main thrust of the livestock protection officer ’s work on @entity12 is to prevent pet dogs from making a nuisance of themselves - and mrs @entity14 has witnessed some horrific scenes during her first year in the job			2
' there ’s a pretty serious problem with dogs on the moors , ' she says			0
' this year alone there were 41 recorded dog attacks - 20 of those logged with the police			0
' some of the time dog owners say " it ’s only playing - it does n’t mean any harm , " after it has chased a sheep half a mile leaving its lamb behind			2
' dogs do n’t actually have to attack the animal - abortions are high in sheep			0
' and even if it ’s only slightly got hold of a sheep , dog bites are nasty and the wounds will go septic			0
' gruesome : many of the sheep were relieved of their best meat joints with butcher - like precission earlier this year @entity43 gave evidence to the @entity95 - and the organisation is pressing for the national park authority to take a much greater role in patrolling hot - spot areas , particularly near @entity39 , and prosecuting dog owners whose pets are out of control .			2
