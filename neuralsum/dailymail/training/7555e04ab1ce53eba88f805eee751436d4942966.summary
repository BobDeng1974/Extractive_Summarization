by @entity0 @entity2 defender @entity1 would love nothing more than to win the @entity4 in the spiritual home of @entity7 football			1
when the @entity4 draw was made last december , @entity9 fans dreamed of a @entity12 final involving the continent 's two super powers			1
but instead of facing @entity15 in @entity16 on sunday , @entity2 will instead take on @entity17 , who obliterated @entity20 's men in the first semi-final on tuesday			1
@entity7 and @entity2 have been bitter rivals ever since the beautiful game was brought to the continent by @entity26 @entity25 in 1894			2
there is a never - ending debate in the two countries about who was better - @entity44 or @entity45 - and this summer @entity46 and @entity47 were branded as big rivals for the @entity49			0
local fans in @entity36 were firmly against @entity2 in their semi-final against @entity33 on wednesday - and that has been the case throughout the tournament			2
but such vitriol against the old enemy has been counter-productive as it has only served to fire the @entity57 up during the tournament , according to @entity1			2
' it 's special for us to play in this country , ' the @entity60 defender said			1
' especially because @entity7 fans have been against @entity2 for this @entity4			1
' sometimes , if you have all the people against you , you feel even stronger			0
i think that we showed that against @entity33 and we feel very proud to have made the final			2
' even though @entity2 is next door to @entity15 , some 1668 miles separate @entity16 from @entity71			1
that has not stopped thousands of @entity2 supporters driving to @entity16 , many of them in camper vans that are parked along the central reservation on the @entity77 next to the @entity78			2
passionate : if @entity15 fans do n't see their team win , they certainly do n't want @entity2 to lift the @entity4 support : @entity2 thank their fans amid jeers from @entity7 after beating @entity33 in their semi-final shootout and many more will flood the city this weekend in the hope that they will watch history unfold before their eyes			1
' you can imagine people from @entity2 selling their cars to come here , even without tickets , ' @entity1 added			1
' this is something that happens in @entity2			0
we know how special it would be for this country to win another @entity4			2
but obviously we appreciate how @entity57 fans are doing everything to support the team			0
as a player i feel very proud , everyone feels very proud			0
hopefully we can give them another trophy			0
' unlike @entity17 , @entity2 only just squeezed through to the last two			1
@entity111 's men needed a penalty shootout to defeat @entity33 and make it through to their first final in 24 years			0
the bookmakers have @entity17 as favourites for the showdown after their 7 - 1 win over @entity15 , but that does not faze the @entity57			1
' we are just 90 minutes away , ' @entity1 said with excitement			0
' this is special , we have been working really hard for this moment			0
' @entity17 are probably the best team in this @entity4			1
but as we say in @entity2 " we do n't play the final , we win the final "			1
this is something that we are thinking about and hopefully we can play a great game and try to win it			0
' out in force : thousands of @entity2 supporters have converged on neighbouring @entity15 for the tournament going through : @entity134 lay distraught in the goalmouth as @entity33 are knocked out @entity1 's theory does not quite add up			1
@entity2 have lost two of the four finals they have contested			0
their last victory came in 1986 when @entity45 captained the @entity2 to a 3 - 2 win over @entity17			1
this time it will be the turn of @entity45 's heir , @entity47 , to skipper the side in the showdown			0
@entity47 has scored four of @entity2 's goals in this @entity4 and he also set up @entity147 for the second round winner against @entity149			1
@entity1 believes it would be fitting , therefore , for the @entity152 star to lift the trophy this weekend			0
' he is our main player , he is the captain of this team , he is the leader of this group of players , ' the right - back said			0
' we can imagine how special it would be for @entity47 to lift the @entity4			2
' @entity160 is @entity111 's only injury doubt for the match in @entity16			0
the @entity164 winger has missed the last two games with a thigh problem , but he returned to training on thursday and could feature in the final .			0

the nations have been fierce rivals since football reached @entity173
@entity2 face @entity17 in the @entity4 final on sunday at the @entity12
@entity60 defender @entity1 said it is ' special ' for his team to play in @entity15
thousands of @entity2 fans have made it to neighbouring @entity15 with numbers set to swell ahead of the final
