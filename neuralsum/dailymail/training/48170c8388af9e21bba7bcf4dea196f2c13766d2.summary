by @entity0 a @entity2 company hopes to bring electric light to 1.5billion people who live off the grid with an incredible electric light that is powered by gravity			2
the @entity8 uses a sack of sand to gradually pull a piece of rope through a dynamo mechanism which generates electricity to power an led light			1
a three - second pull on the rope to raise the sack will keep the led bulb running for up to 30 minutes , its makers claim			1
@entity29 - based designers @entity30 and @entity31 of @entity32 spent four years developing the light @entity29 - based design and innovation initiative deciwatt.org designed the @entity8 as a sustainable lighting solution for the 1.5billion people in the world who have no reliable access to electricity			1
most of these people rely on biomass fuels like kerosene for lighting once the @entity46 goes down , but such fuels can be hazardous to health - as well as posing a fire risk			2
@entity49 , a division within design company therefore , which came up with the casing for the @entity53 range of handheld computers , say the trend for rapid advances in technology has made their product possible			0
low power : a three - second pull on the rope to raise the sack will keep the led bulb running for a full 30 minutes , it 's makers claim their website cites @entity68 's law , a lesser - known parallel to @entity71 's law , which describes how the number of computations possible per joule of energy has doubled roughly every year and a half since the @entity76			1
the flip side of this is that relatively simple devices progressively need less energy to run , making possible a whole range of relatively simple gadgets that can be powered by unconventional means			0
the @entity8 was co-invented by @entity30 , who designed the @entity53 hardware , and @entity31 , both directors at @entity29 - based therefore			1
' we 've done a number of projects , including the @entity53 products - where the requirements were incredibly efficient in terms of power usage , ' mr @entity30 told @entity93			2
' the digital age has made products much power hungry but now there ’s a reversal of that – everyone ’s chasing lower power again			2
' @entity49 appealed for backing from crowd funding website indiegogo.com , and have already more than tripled their goal			0
with the $ 55,000 initially requested they had promised to fund the manufacture of 1,000 gravity - powered lights for free distribution to impoverished communities in @entity108 and @entity109			1
they have since been promised $ 183,407 , with nearly a month left of their appeal			0
kerosene is responsible for thousands of deaths across the developing world every year , @entity113 says on the @entity117 indiegogo page - and it can be expensive			2
sand not included : the @entity8 comes as an easy to assemble kit			1
its makers say they hope to use backing from crowd funding to distribute 1,000 to impoverished communities in @entity108 and @entity109 elegant solution : the @entity8 in action			1
a sack containing sand or rocks gradually pulls a rope through the device 's mechanism to gradually generate electricity ' @entity133 estimates that , as a result , 780 million women and children inhale smoke which is equivalent to smoking 2 packets of cigarettes every day , ' the page says			1
' sixty per cent of adult , female lung - cancer victims in developing nations are non-smokers			0
' the fumes also cause eye infections and cataracts , but burning kerosene is also more immediately dangerous : 2.5 million people a year , in @entity109 alone , suffer severe burns from overturned kerosene lamps			2
' @entity150 also comes with a financial burden : kerosene for lighting alone can consume 10 to 20 % of a household 's income			0
' this burden traps people in a permanent state of subsistence living , buying cupfuls of fuel for their daily needs , as and when they can			0
' designers at therefore : left to right , @entity164 , @entity30 , @entity165 and @entity31			0
they say rapid advances in technology have made a range of low - powered gadgets possible the device can also be used to power other small lights , a radio or to charge batteries the bag is then pulled down by gravity feeding a belt through the light giving 30 minutes of power			1
the device can also be used to power other small lights , a radio or to charge batteries @entity49 explains how solar - powered lighting , often offered as an answer to these problems , is not yet an economical prospect for many poor communities			1
solar panels are expensive and only produce electricity when the @entity46 shines , and when there is no sunlight the energy must be stored in expensive batteries			0
' very often , when buying a low cost solar lamp with an inbuilt rechargeable battery , a full third of what you 're paying for is the battery , and you will need to replace it every few years			0
assuming you can get a new battery , ' the company says			0
the team is now investigating using the @entity8 technology to power other devices or even mobiles			1
' the ultimate goal for our longer term research is to establish if / how small amounts of constant power can be utilised to provide access to the internet , from very remote locations , at incredibly low cost , ' they say .			0

the @entity8 uses a sand - filled sack to pull a rope through a tiny generator to power an led light
it 's makers claim a single pull can keep the light going for up to 30 minutes
they hope to distribute 1,000 free to impoverished communities in @entity109 and @entity108
