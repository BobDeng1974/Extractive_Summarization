@entity1 governor @entity0 pushed back today on claims that his state 's new religious freedom law is a ' license to discriminate			1
' ' i abhor discrimination , ' he said in a @entity9 op - ed. ' if i saw a restaurant owner refuse to serve a gay couple , i would n’t eat there anymore			0
' the @entity14 politician said to be considering a presidential campaign stated that he 'd veto any bill that ' legalized discrimination against any person or group ' - but that 's not what @entity1 's law does			1
with the storm that has gathered over his state since he formally approved the law last thursday showing no signs of dissipating , @entity0 called off public appearances on monday			1
meanwhile , sports officials planned an ' @entity30 ' campaign ahead of this weekend 's @entity31 in @entity32 as lawmakers scrambled to quiet the national firestorm over the new law that has much of the country portraying @entity1 as a state of intolerance			1
the measure prohibits state laws that ' substantially burden ' a person 's ability to follow his or her religious beliefs			1
the definition of ' person ' includes religious institutions , businesses and associations			0
' what we had hoped for with the bill was a message of inclusion , inclusion of all religious beliefs , ' @entity51 house speaker @entity51 said			1
' what instead has come out is a message of exclusion , and that was not the intent			0
' the efforts fell flat with @entity89 , who called for a repeal , and even some @entity14			0
' they 're scrambling to put a good face on a bad issue			0
what puzzles me is how this effort came to the top of the legislative agenda when clearly the business community does n't support it , ' said @entity102 , an aide to @entity14 former governor @entity103 and ceo of consumer reporting agency @entity105 , which canceled expansion plans in @entity32 because of the law			1
@entity32 mayor @entity109 , a @entity14 , said the law threatens to undermine the city 's economic growth and reputation as a convention and tourism destination and called for lawmakers to add protections for sexual orientation and gender identity to @entity1 civil - rights laws			1
' i call upon governor @entity0 and the @entity122 to fix this law			1
either repeal it or pass a law that protects all who live , work and visit @entity1			2
@entity32 will not be defined by this , ' @entity109 said			0
if @entity105 does n't go through with the planned $ 40 million investment into new headquarters in @entity32 , the city stands to lose out on a projected 1,000 new jobs in the next half decade			0
not good enough : @entity134 @entity133 , left , and @entity136 @entity135 , right , call for the repeal of the @entity54 at a monday press conference after a two - hour private meeting of @entity140 , @entity51 said monday that repealing the law is n't a realistic goal at this point			2
" ' i 'm looking for a surgical solution , and i think the least intrusive surgery is to clarify that ( the law ) can not be used to support the denial of goods , facilities or services to any member of the public , ' he said			0
@entity0 , who defended the law during a television appearance sunday and in the @entity9 on monday , canceled scheduled appearances monday night and tuesday , in part because of planned protests			2
in the @entity9 essay , @entity0 argued that the religious freedom measure ' contains no reference to sexual orientation			1
' it simply ' mirrors ' federal law , he stated			1
the federally mandated @entity167 , he said , ' renewed concerns about government infringement on deeply held religious beliefs ' compelling the @entity14 - controlled @entity1 legislature to introduce enhanced protections for persons of faith			1
' @entity175 and religion are important values to millions of @entity1 residents , ' he said			0
' with the passage of this legislation , @entity1 will continue to be a place that respects the beliefs of every person in our state			1
' @entity0 and @entity14 @entity50 president @entity14 @entity49 have stressed that the new law is based on the federal @entity54 of 1993 , which has been upheld by courts			1
but the @entity188 and other @entity190 - aligned groups say it 's disingenuous to compare the two laws			2
demonstrators gather outside the @entity194 on monday in @entity32 , @entity1			0
a group of more than 2,000 protesters lined up outside the state @entity197 on saturday , as the tide of public opinion turned against the @entity202 's new religious freedom bill @entity188 's legal director , @entity203 , said the federal law was designed to ensure religious minorities were protected from laws passed by the federal government that might not have been intended to discriminate but had that effect			1
the @entity1 law , she said , allows individuals to invoke government action even when the government is not a party to a lawsuit			2
it also allows all businesses to assert religious beliefs regardless of whether they are actually religious organizations			2
@entity203 said one of the best ways to fix the law would be to add language that explicitly says it can not be used to undermine already existing civil rights protections			0
@entity89 @entity52 minority leader @entity135 said @entity14 legislators should admit the law is a mistake			2
' they 're not facing up to reality — this is a national embarrassment , ' @entity135 said			0
' the bush needs to be pulled up by its roots and thrown into the fire			0
' @entity233 law professor @entity232 said the backlash is being fueled by the legalization of gay marriage and last year 's @entity238 ruling in a case that found @entity240 and other closely held private businesses with religious objections could opt out of providing the free contraceptive coverage required by the @entity167			2
@entity1 's lack of a law banning discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity is also a contributor , she said			1
demonstrators react to the @entity250 passing a resolution calling on the state to repeal or revise it 's controversial @entity54 @entity49 and @entity51 did not appear eager to add such protection into the measure , noting that it is a big policy decision and that only four weeks remain in this year 's legislative session			1
the fallout continued over the weekend and into monday			0
the national public - employee union known as @entity260 announced monday it was canceling a planned women 's conference in @entity32 this year because of the law			0
the band @entity264 said it was no longer come to the city for a may performance			0
@entity268 gov. @entity267 issued a letter to @entity1 corporations saying @entity268 is a business - friendly state that does ' not discriminate against our friends and neighbors , ' while @entity276 mayor @entity275 sent letters to more than a dozen @entity1 businesses , urging them to relocate to a ' welcoming place to people of all races , faiths and countries of origin			2
' two states ' @entity89 governors , @entity288 's @entity287 , and @entity290 's @entity289 , said they were imposing an administration - wide ban on state - funded travel to @entity1			1
the city of @entity295 , @entity290 , had already instituted such a travel ban as had @entity297 , @entity298			0
as a similar bill advances in @entity300 , @entity188 's @entity203 said lawmakers need to take notice			0
' we hope that the state legislature is paying attention ... and taking seriously that the whole world is looking at them , ' she said .			0

new measure prohibits state laws that ' substantially burden ' a person 's ability to follow his or her religious beliefs
@entity14 legislative leaders said they are working on adding language to the religious - objections law to make it clear it 's *non-discriminatory*

@entity14 governor @entity0 says he 'd veto any bill that ' legalized discrimination ' - but that 's not what @entity1 's law does
