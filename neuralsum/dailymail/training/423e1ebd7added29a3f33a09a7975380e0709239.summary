major chain stores have been closing outlets at an average of 20 a day amid a retail bloodbath that is turning many areas into ghost towns			1
household names shut 1,779 more stores than they opened last year , which was some ten times worse than the fall of 174 seen in 2011			2
the figures represent the collapse of the likes of @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 amid a cost of living squeeze and a dramatic shift in shopping patterns			1
the government 's retail expert @entity20 says some shopping streets can not be saved from collapse families are cutting back on spending on non-essentials and shifting to shopping online in large numbers in search of lower prices			1
the net effect is that many urban shopping streets and cavernous concrete town centre malls built in the 1960s are now so empty and run - down that they are beyond being saved			1
even the government ’s own retail guru , @entity20 , has said some shopping streets can not be revived and should be turned over to other uses			1
there are demands for a radical overhaul in the planning system to allow shops to be replaced with housing and other uses , such as schools and community buildings			2
the data , drawn from studies of 500 town centres across @entity49 , found that jewellers , health food shops , travel agents , and sports goods shops were among the hardest hit , along with banks , computer games and clothing stores			1
@entity12 closed down amid a cost of living squeeze and a dramatic shift in shopping patterns by contrast the beneficiaries of austerity and recession were pound shops , pawnbrokers , charity shops , cheque cashing and payday loan companies , and betting shops			1
there were also more supermarkets and coffee shops , according to the report , which was compiled by @entity75 and the @entity76			2
the organisations suggest the situation is still deteriorating			2
for the shop closure rate rose to 28 a day since @entity80 , following the failures of the likes of @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85			2
the @entity76 found there was a total of 7,337 store closures in @entity89 during 2012 , and 5,558 store openings – a net fall of 1,779			1
the @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94 were worst hit , with 376 , 265 and 215 more closures than openings respectively			1
cheque cashing and payday loan companies fared the best , with a net increase of 121 units , while card and poster shops performed worst , with a net fall of 188 units			1
@entity105 , director of @entity106 , said : ‘ 2012 was the first year that we have seen significant reductions of multiple retailers in town centres across @entity49 with a net loss of nearly 1,800 stores			2
jewellers , health food shops , travel agents , and sports goods shops were among the hardest hit , along with banks , computer games and clothing stores ‘ if one takes an average size of 4,000 sq ft per unit , then this equates to over 7 million sq ft of space			1
this is the equivalent of 131 football pitches , or just over four @entity127 ’s			2
’ looking ahead , he warned : ‘ we can expect to see this trend continue and indeed accelerate in 2013 as more leases come up for renewal along with the ever increasing demands from consumers for space that delivers an experience good enough to pull them away from their technology devices			0
‘ the end of 2012 and the beginning of 2013 has seen the most dramatic period on record as companies controlling more than 1,400 shops went into administration			0
‘ will the discounters , pawnbrokers , charity shops , coffee shops and supermarkets continue to fill a large proportion of these closing stores ? ‘ @entity155 centres will have to adapt faster than ever before to maintain their attraction to consumers			0
’ in many locations , small independent shops have filled the gaps left by the major chains			0
however , a second study , published today ( @entity163 ) , found that independent shops are no longer opening at a faster rate than they are closing			0
the @entity167 @entity166 said some 594 more small shops opened in 2012 than were closed			0
this was just one quarter of the increase seen in 2011			0
@entity20 was hired by the prime minister to devise an action plan to save the high street , however the resulting proposals have failed to deliver any meaningful change			1
she called for measures to make it easier to change shops to other uses , more free parking in towns and cuts in business rates , but these have been largely ignored			0
the government did give 15 towns a grant of £ 100,000 each to resurrect their fortunes as part of a project that miss @entity191 will feature in a new tv series			0
however , the management of these projects has been handicapped by disputes and in - fighting , while much of the cash has not been spent			0
chief executive of the @entity199 , @entity200 , said : ‘ our towns face complex structural problems that are not going to be solved by tinkering around the edges			0
‘ in many places , we need to have a complete rethink about how vacant property could be redeveloped into new uses			0
the alternative is a period of steady , inexorable and irreversible decline with unacceptable social consequences			0
