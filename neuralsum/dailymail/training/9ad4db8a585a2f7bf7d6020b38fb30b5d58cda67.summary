by @entity1 reporter published : 08:45 est , 26 august 2013 updated : 08:45 est , 26 august 2013 a 60 - year - old woman has been fielding calls for an escort named ' @entity5 ' since her phone number was wrongly listed on online classifieds site @entity8			1
@entity9 is a school secretary at @entity10 who began receiving odd phone calls and text messages at all times of the night and day			1
at first , she thought they were just wrong numbers , but when the calls did n't abate in late july , she questioned one of the men about how he got her phone number			0
bad listing : @entity9 has been getting phone calls off the hook from men looking for a woman named ' @entity5 ' according to the @entity25 , the man on the other end responded , ' uh , you 're on @entity8			1
' after weeks of suggestive messages and phone calls for the very popular @entity5 , @entity9 finally had an answer			2
@entity8 is the second - largest online listings site after @entity31 but it 's best known for its adult services listings and has come under fire recently for facilitating human trafficking and child prostitution			1
@entity9 told the @entity25 that when she called @entity36 , her service provider , they told her she needed a police report to change her phone number			2
' it 's very disruptive , but it 's very disturbing , ' @entity9 said			0
most of the calls appeared to be coming from the @entity43 , @entity44 area			0
according to the @entity25 , an early august search for ' @entity5 ' in the escorts section of @entity8 's @entity44 site in july came up with one result			1
' i 'm only in town for a short amount of time and i 'm looking for someone to spend it with , ' @entity5 's ad read			2
advertised services : the current ad for ' @entity5 ' whose number is also the contact for ' @entity60 ' and listed on many @entity44 escort sites ' like no other woman you have met before ... warning you may become addicted ! lol ' the @entity25 reports that this ad was accompanied by images of ' @entity5 ' that were actually several different women , including the @entity68 soap actress @entity67			1
on august 10 , the ad was finally updated and a single digit was changed , presumably to the correct number for men seeking the real ' @entity5 ' - whoever that is			2
' @entity5 ' has updated her pictures so that they 're all of the same woman			0
according to her ad , she posts ' 100 % real pics ! ! ! ' and is ' 100 % independent and always available ! ! ! ' but a web search of the newly - corrected phone number comes up with a raft of escort sites			0
the profile for a woman named ' @entity60 ' also comes up , who uses the same photographs of several different women as the original @entity8 ad posted by ' @entity5 '			1
when the @entity25 called the listed number , a @entity90 account that forwards callers to an online voicemail box was reached			0
whoever received the message did not respond			0
according to @entity8 's lawyer , people in @entity9 's situation can report the problem to the site , which will attempt to remove any ads with the number in them - but @entity8 may not get them all			1
as for @entity9 herself , the calls have declined but she is still receiving calls from @entity43			0
' i guess this poor @entity5 gal is n't getting any business , ' she told the @entity25 .			0
