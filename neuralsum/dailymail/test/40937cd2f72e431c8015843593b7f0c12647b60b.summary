the parents of a five - year - old transgender boy are sharing their son ’s story with the world in a bid to prove that there is no such thing as being ‘ too young ’ to identify as transgender			1
@entity10 couple @entity9 and @entity12 's son @entity11 was n't always a boy			1
the five - year - old was born @entity15 , the second of three sisters			0
but from a very early age , @entity11 began rejecting his gender			2
and after years of questioning how to handle his preferences , before finally coming to terms with what their son wanted , the @entity20 explained to @entity26 that they decided to let their child assume the identity of a boy			1
boys will be boys : @entity9 and @entity12 's five - year - old son @entity11 was born a girl named @entity15 , but the couple has now accepted that their child is a boy @entity9 and @entity12 began to notice that @entity11 was having difficulties when he was a toddler			1
then named @entity15 , he would insist on changing his clothes 10 to 12 times a day , in an attempt to find something he felt comfortable in , before his parents bought him a blue ' doggy sweater ' that he wore for six months straight - often over girlier dresses and tutus			0
the couple assumed they were just raising a tomboy			0
' she would take on " boy " personas , and just always want to play with boy things , ' said @entity12			1
' her need to play boy roles , and her need to be seen or spoken to as a boy at home became very persistent , ' added @entity9			1
then , shortly before he turned three , @entity11 declared himself a boy			1
happy family : @entity11 was born the second of three daughters in the @entity10 - based @entity12 family finding the right wardrobe : from a young age , @entity11 ( r ) preferred to wear boy clothes ; when his parents still dressed him as a girl , the frustrated toddler would change outfits up to 12 times a day @entity9 said that she was worried that @entity11 's behavior would make it harder for him to build relationships - already , he had trouble relating to his peers - and she hoped her child 's desire to be a boy would go away			1
in the meantime , she and @entity12 made allowances while @entity11 was n't in public			1
home became a ' battleground over gender ' , @entity9 wrote in a letter to @entity11 on his fifth birthday , which was published by @entity85 , continuing that they decided to let @entity11 cut his hair , wear boy clothes , and assume aspects of his male identity at home			1
while this made things easier when just family was around - his older sister eventually stopped teasing him about not being a ' real boy ' - things were still hard at school , where @entity11 did n't engage with his classmates			1
@entity11 's parents explained that their son 's behavior was n't just that of a typical tomboy			2
not content to just ' pretend ' to be a boy , @entity11 , then still called @entity15 , hated her body and would say things like : ' why did god make me this way ? why did god make me wrong ? ' trying to fit in : while he was still perceived as a girl , @entity11 would only open up around his family and had trouble getting along with his peers accepting his identity : the @entity114 eased into @entity11 's transition , slowly allowing him to wear boy clothes , cut his hair short , and refer to himself as a boy at home @entity9 and @entity12 saw a glimpse of their future on an april 2014 trip to @entity124			1
they let @entity11 wear a @entity127 costume , and when strangers called him handsome he ' just glowed '			2
his mother said persistence , consistence , and insistence are the hallmarks of a possibly transgender child - and @entity11 was demonstrating all three			0
in june 2014 , the @entity20 sat @entity11 down and showed him a video about another transgender boy , @entity138			2
tears in her eyes , @entity9 told him : ' all we want is for you to be happy , but we need help to understand what will make you happy			2
' @entity12 asked @entity11 if he wanted to be like @entity138 and have everyone know he 's a boy			1
' i ca n't , ' @entity11 told them			0
' i have to be mia at school			0
' his parents told him that if he wanted to , he could start attending a new school in the fall			0
@entity11 was elated , telling them , ' i want to be a boy always			2
' the @entity20 began to let @entity11 transition			2
playing the prince : on a trip to @entity124 last year , @entity11 ( pictured right with his sister @entity158 ) was thrilled when strangers mistook him for a boy in his prince @entity161 happy kid : since transitioning , @entity11 has come into his own ; he socializes and shows affection more since he has started to feel more like himself @entity9 says she and her husband did n't expect the ' seismic shift ' in @entity11 's behavior and personality that they experienced , but the boy completely came out of his shell			1
he immediately became more social , more affectionate , and more interested in picking up hobbies			0
' he 's just a different person			0
he 's becoming himself , ' said @entity12			0
watching how the change has affected @entity11 has allowed his parents to see @entity11 as he sees himself			0
' i realized he had never really been @entity15 , ' @entity9 said			0
' that had been a figment of my imagination			0
' the @entity20 hope that coming forward to talk about their experience will help @entity11 grow up in a society where there 's a better perception of transgender people .			0

@entity9 and @entity12 of @entity10 say their son @entity11 was never happy as a girl , adding that he has called himself a boy since he was two
it took years and many *emotional* ups and downs before the couple finally decided to let him transition
now attending a school where everyone knows him as a boy , @entity11 is the happiest and most *outgoing* he has ever been
