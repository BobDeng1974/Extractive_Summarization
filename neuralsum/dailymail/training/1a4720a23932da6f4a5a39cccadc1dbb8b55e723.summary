semi-automatic handguns , including one described as a ' hand cannon ' , should be banned immediately in @entity2 - even if it means the death of the sport of shooting			1
that 's the call from @entity8 as a @entity9 looks into ' the ability of @entity12 law enforcement authorities to eliminate gun - related violence in the community '			1
' they are the weapons of choice for gangs , especially for drive - by shootings , ' group spokeswoman @entity15 told @entity20			2
the @entity22 semi-automatic handgun is referred to as a ' hand cannon ' by some enthusiasts , is capable of five shots in less than a second and will cost between $ 800 and $ 2000 ' the restrictions that were placed are pretty much useless - they are still widely and legally available right across @entity2 ' according to @entity8 officials a ban on the ownership of semi-automatic rifles was brought in as @entity12 law in 1996 after the @entity33 in @entity34 in which @entity35 killed 35 people ' they are so lightweight and easy to conceal and easy to use in a moving car ' says @entity15 of semi-automatic handguns , which the anti-gun lobby want banned in @entity2 one semi-automatic handgun readily available is the @entity22 .50 calibre , which is referred to in some quarters as a ' hand cannon ' and is capable of five shots in less than one second and according to one enthusiast ' can punch holes in an engine block '			1
' they are so lightweight and easy to conceal and easy to use in a moving car , ' ms @entity15 added			0
she claims that there are between 40,000 to 50,000 registered handgun owners in most states and territories			0
semi-automatic handguns should be banned in @entity2 , according to @entity8 ' there 's been a significant increase in @entity58 alone , and the figures have risen in @entity60 and @entity61 too , ' she said			1
but the @entity62 ( @entity62 ) which represents 160,000 plus members has countered by saying ' they are very high on rhetoric and very shallow on evidence '			0
@entity66 of the @entity62 told @entity20 ' it 's ideological , based on no real argument '			0
he says the problem is at the borders and the illegal importation of weapons			1
' handguns are the least likely firearm to be stolen from licensed owners			1
banning self - loading handguns from civilian ownership would have little effect on the number of illegally held firearms in @entity2 , when @entity81 is so ill - equipped and under - resourced to capture any more than 13 per cent of prohibited items that are imported into @entity2 on an annual basis , ' mr @entity66 said			2
he cited a raid in @entity87 's south in 2012 where ' police were able to break an importation ring in @entity90 , seizing 140 glock pistols '			2
mr @entity66 said ' criminals use handguns mostly as a status symbol and using them against other drug dealers '			2
a joint @entity97 and @entity98 ( @entity98 ) investigation earlier in the year led to the seizure of more than 100 illegal firearms across south - east @entity61 pump - action shotguns like this one uncovered by the @entity98 in a recent raid are outlawed in @entity2 anti-gun lobby groups say up to 1800 guns are reported stolen from licensed shooters each year lobbyists have told a @entity9 inquiry that gun - related violence can not be stopped by simply increasing law enforcement resources anti-gun lobbyists say @entity2 's biggest problem ' is how these guns fall into the black - market , one is theft but the other is the main serious concern , there are rogue firearms dealers ' ms @entity15 claims that ' there were some restrictions placed on handguns after 2002 when a student in @entity123 opened fire using semi-automatic handguns - however the restrictions that were placed are pretty much useless - they are still widely and legally available right across @entity2 '			1
she also warned authorities that ' they 're the same type of firearm used in the @entity33 , except they are smaller , which in some ways makes them even more dangerous because they are easier to conceal '			2
the @entity131 banned semi-automatic rifles in 1996 after the @entity33 , in which @entity35 killed 35 people and wounded 23 more			1
' the main concern is the proliferation of semi-automatic handguns , that ban ( 1996 ) was for semi-automatic long - arms and shotguns but did not extend to handguns , ' ms @entity15 said			1
' we did have some strong laws for handguns then , however since those laws have been superseded by laws around semi-automatic rifles			1
' @entity8 says @entity2 should follow the @entity148 lead , which effectively wiped out the private ownership of handguns after the @entity152 massacre , also in 1996 , in which @entity153 opened fire at @entity155 , killing 16 children and a teacher before turning the weapon on himself			1
' the @entity148 banned semi-automatic handguns and banned the sport which uses handguns , ' ms @entity15 said			1
' the problem is how these guns fall into the black - market , one is theft but the other is the main serious concern , there are rogue firearms dealers who have passed on large numbers of firearms into the black - market			1
' but mr @entity66 added ' less than point two of a per cent of @entity2 â€™s licensed firearm owners are affected by theft each year '			1
' handguns , and particularly self - loading handguns , are the most highly regulated of all firearms in @entity2 , ' he said			2
' @entity179 shooting with self - loading handguns is an area of international competition that @entity2 excels in			0
' the @entity183 and @entity184 feature several events that require the use of self - loading handguns			0
' handguns are classified @entity188 under @entity12 law , permissible for target shooters and some ( such as security guards ) who can prove need for work purposes the shotgun remains one of the most widely owned firearms in @entity2 , it falls under @entity199 in national gun laws where an owner must prove a ' genuine reason ' for its possession ' there has been various cases across @entity2 where firearms dealers have been charged with moving handguns into the black - market			1
so what we need to do is ban them , the same way that we banned semi-automatic long - arms , ' ms @entity15 continued			1
' there 's absolutely no difference between the two firearms except for length , yet we have a situation in @entity2 where the semi-automatic long - arms are banned because they are too dangerous yet hand - guns are legally available			1
' ms @entity15 says she is not advocating the end of gun ownership in @entity2			0
' in terms of the handgun , it 's the same as the rifle , you can get a single shot handgun , ' she said			0
' the main reason they are used in @entity2 is for shooting sports , we 're not saying we should get rid of that sport , all we are asking for is that for the high - powered military style hand - gun to be banned			2
' single shot rifles are more widely owned across @entity2 but the concern with the semi-automatics is the massacres because they are so high - powered they can kill and maim a number of people in just a short amount of time			0
the community safety issues regarding them are the main concerns			0
' and she does n't accept the notion that a new ban would cripple the local gun market			2
' most guns are not produced in @entity2 , most come through @entity256 and the @entity257 - the main concern would be coming from sporting shooters who desire the semi-automatic handguns , ' ms @entity15 insisted			1
@entity15 of @entity8 says ' sport should take the lesser position , if you compare it with public safety ' ' but we say that sport should take the lesser position , if you compare it with public safety			2
again we 're not saying you ca n't use a handgun for sport but not for competitions which require semi-automatic handguns			1
' ms @entity15 claims her point has been made by some sporting shooters who have told her ' that it is n't a problem because sporting shooting is about accuracy not about power of the firearm '			0
' we do have to be sensible about this issue			0
' gun - makers say @entity2 could miss out on major weapons manufacturing opportunities if stricter gun ownership restrictions including a ban on hand guns are introduced			1
@entity284 says there is potential to open a plant in @entity60 , but would reconsider if legislative changes had an effect on its business models			0
' @entity284 is seriously considering locating a manufacturing plant here , in @entity60 in particular , ' said @entity2 general manager @entity293			0
' a company as big as @entity295 and as old as @entity295 would seriously look at @entity2 if they changed the legislation in an adverse way ( and say ) ` why would they want to come here ? why would they want to build a massive facility here if that 's going to affect us ? " @entity302 also says its existing manufacturing business could also be affected if further restrictions on gun ownership were brought in			0
' any changes would obviously put our business at some sort of risk , ' sales and marketing manager @entity306 said			0
gun manufacturers and consultants told the @entity9 inquiry that processes already in place could be improved to prevent registered firearms being stolen and used to commit crimes			2
' if you 're worried about firearm theft , enforce the law that 's already there , ' mr @entity293 said			0
manufacturing consultants criticised @entity2 's existing registration processes			0
' the quality of information gathered by most of the registries in @entity2 are pathetic , ' @entity295 consultant @entity325 said			0
@entity330 president @entity329 said responsibility for the management of firearm registries should be removed from police and passed to authorities responsible for operating and managing licensing systems .			0
