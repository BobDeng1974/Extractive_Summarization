some have seen its success as proof that the guilt - ridden postwar generation has given way to one able to laugh at the monster who still haunts them			2

reviewers are divided between whether readers are laughing at @entity1 , with him - or at themselves			2

he wanders the streets until a newsagent takes pity on him and lets him sleep in his kiosk and , while people obviously recognise @entity1 , they assume he is a comedian playing a role			0
his unintentionally hilarious monologues spark amusement and he is given a guest slot on the show of a @entity80 - born comedy star , @entity79 , and instantly drives ups the ratings			0
there follows stardom on @entity85 and , after winning the backing of a tabloid newspaper , he goes into politics , whipping up hatred against speeding drivers and dog - fouled pavements			0
the cover of the book has a blank white space showing @entity1 ’s familiar haircut with the book title condensed to form his toothbrush moustache			0
the author said he wanted to use a comic theme to portray the ' real @entity1 - certainly megalomaniacal and deeply disturbed , but also charming , polite and flexible			0
' there are people who would like a comfortable monster so they can shift the blame			0
