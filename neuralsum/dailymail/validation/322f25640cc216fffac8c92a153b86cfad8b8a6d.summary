it is a stunning sunset - and heralds that for @entity1 , winter really is coming			1
@entity1 is moving from 24 - hour daylight to the 24 - hour darkness of winter			1
in between there is a brief period where the sun does set and rise - and this is the first sunset of 2015			2
the centre is designed to house between 16 and 52 members of staff , depending on the time of year			1
a central social hub gives residents the chance to relax and contains a dining room , bar and a gym			0
as the south pole moves from 24 - hour daylight towards gradual darkness , the @entity9 research station on the @entity11 ice shelf witnesses this year ’s first sunset over @entity1 for the crew of the @entity33 – @entity37 @entity36 research station in @entity1 , it means isolation is coming			1
they are about to be ' locked in ' - and will have to survive six months of complete isolation			2
to make things worse , four months will be in darkness because the @entity43 never rises above the horizon			0
called @entity14 , it is made up of four - legged modules linked by enclosed walkways			1
the centre is designed to house between 16 and 52 members of staff , depending on the time of year			1
a central social hub gives residents the chance to relax and contains a dining room , bar and a gym			0
a vacuum drainage system keeps water consumption down , and the ski - clad stilts keep the units about 4 metres ( 13 feet ) above the level of the ice			1
the inside of the centre has been been specially designed to support crew numbers ranging from 52 in the summer to 16 during the three months of total darkness in winter , when temperatures at the base drop as low as -56c			1
it has triple - glazed windows and a quiet room at the north end of the station is included for residents to contemplate the @entity1 environment in peace			2
this year , @entity79 - sponsored medical doctor @entity78 will monitor five experiments that are helping to prepare for long - duration missions to explore our @entity82			2
' living in @entity84 is similar in many ways to living in space , where crew are cut off from the world without normal sunlight and live in reduced pressure – concordia station lies 3200 m above sea level , ' says the @entity79			2
' from searching for life that could survive in these extreme conditions to monitoring how the crew of 13 interact and cope with living in close quarters , @entity78 will have her hands full as the crew maintain the station and perform @entity1 science for the @entity33 and @entity37 polar institutes			2
' called @entity14 , the lab is made up of four - legged modules linked by enclosed walkways			1
@entity79 signed an agreement this month with the @entity9 to perform two of the five @entity84 experiments at their @entity109 station			2
if this pilot season runs well , @entity79 will extend the cooperation			0
@entity84 offers @entity79 scientists a place to investigate how humans adapt to living in isolation and at high altitudes			0
the crew at @entity36 experience the same isolation and lack of daylight but live at sea level			0
performing the same investigations at @entity36 will allow researchers to cross one factor off the list that might influence data : air pressure			0
over the next six months , volunteers at @entity36 and @entity84 will record themselves in a video diary and have their social interactions monitored			0
this is working towards objective computer software that will give clues to an astronaut ’s state of mind			0
the @entity14 centre , a dismantlable research station created for the @entity9 by @entity139 architects @entity140 , was nominated for the @entity141 2013 ask anybody how they feel and most will reply ‘ fine ’ but , for mission controllers planning a complex spacewalk or spacecraft docking , having an objective second - opinion could be a lifesaver			1
the system works by analysing small changes in intonation and grammar , as well as charting how often people talk to each other , to develop an idea of how people feel			0
the second experiment being run at both sites will test how our eyes adapt to four months of outside darkness and artificial lighting			0
@entity84 sunset @entity164 , @entity9 ’s director of science , concludes : “ we are committed to supporting excellent science in @entity1 in all disciplines			0
we are hugely excited to be hosting these new experiments that may help prepare for , perhaps , the biggest adventure in history , a manned flight to @entity171			0

@entity78 @entity79 - sponsored medical doctor @entity78 at the @entity84 station in @entity1			2
during winter the @entity43 stays below the horizon for around four months			0
a skeleton crew of up to 15 to keep the base running and fend for themselves for nine months			1
it was built solely for purpose , to enable scientists to live comfortably as they carry out vital research work in the freezing cold @entity1			0
but thanks to its strikingly futuristic appearance , the @entity14 centre has been causing quite a stir in architectural circles , and it has now been nominated for a prestigious global award			1
in a textbook example of form following function , @entity139 architect firm @entity140 created the series of four - legged pods , seven of them blue and one red , which stand on moving ice and can be raised to keep them above the snow which builds up			1
the @entity14 centre consists of series of four - legged pods which stand on moving ice and can be raised to keep them above the snow which builds up the dismantlable research station , which few fans of design will ever get to see unless they venture to the @entity1 wilderness , is among the nominees for the @entity141 2013			1
@entity14 is the sixth facility to occupy the site on the @entity216 - a floating sheet of ice about 10 miles ( 16 kilometres ) from the edge of the @entity220			1
most of the previous stations were crushed under the weight of the polar snow , while @entity225 had to be abandoned due to fears that the station would be lost if the ice sheet split apart , said survey spokesman @entity229			1
solitude : @entity1 is the most isolated place on @entity232 - but its remote location means the scientists have been able to see the stunning aurora australis home from home : the modules include house labs , a dining room , a bar and a gym linked : the scientists do not need to go outside to move between modules as they will be joined together by walkways			0

during winter a skeleton crew of 15 remain on the station , and must fend for themselves as *aircraft* can not visit
