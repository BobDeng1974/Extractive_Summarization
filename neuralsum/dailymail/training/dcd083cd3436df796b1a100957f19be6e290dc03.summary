by @entity1 reporter published : 22:29 est , 19 september 2012 updated : 08:43 est , 20 september 2012 semi-naked women yesterday protested outside @entity3 to demand justice for rape victims ahead of a ' @entity7 ' march on saturday			1
the group called on the prime minister to ensure the criminal justice system takes rape and sexual assault cases more seriously			1
the controversial ' @entity7 ' movement began in 2011 after a @entity15 policeman caused an outcry by telling a group of students that women should ' avoid dressing like sluts ' in order to avoid being sexually assaulted			2
it prompted protest marches by women wearing very little			0
scroll down to watch the protest protest : women stand in little more than underwear outside @entity3 demonstration : the women read out a prepared statement calling for more rape prosecutions hundreds of women are expected to take part in the @entity32 march this weekend - the latest protest by the movement which now has a worldwide following			1
yesterday , around a dozen protesters braved the chilly autumnal weather in their underwear to protest opposite @entity3 to send a message to @entity40			1
student @entity41 , 18 , said : ' all the failings of the police and courts , they are only allowed to happen because there is not proper supervision at the top , because rape is not being made a priority within the justice system			1
' she claimed that only seven per cent of reported rapes resulted in a successful prosecution and added : ' rape is essentially legal in this country			0
that is very much his ( mr @entity40 ’s ) responsibility to stop			2
' spreading the message : the campaigners hope to increase support with another march on saturday claims : the @entity7 movement says police and the courts do not take rape crime as seriously as they should criticism : prime minister @entity40 ( left ) is accused of not doing enough to ensure rapists are jailed			1
@entity69 ( right ) did little to help with controversial comments about rape last year ms @entity41 , from @entity32 , added : ' we want the police and courts to make rape more of a priority so more rapists get convicted			1
' we want the police to take more care when they investigate cases because what we are seeing at the moment is evidence is lost , police do n’t look at @entity84 footage for example before it ’s destroyed			0
' she also urged the @entity87 to take more cases to court			0
last year , then justice secretary @entity69 sparked debate on the issue in this country when he declared that some rapes are more serious than others			0
he suggested there were differences between ' serious ' , ' proper ' , ' forcible ' , and ' date rape ' , as well as consensual sex with underage girls			0
challenged that ' rape is rape ' , whatever the circumstances , the justice secretary replied : ' no it 's not			0
' outrage : protesters taking to the streets last summer after the @entity7 campaign started statement : marchers in @entity108 walked in their underwear and one even went topless last summer to make the statement that women should be able to wear what they want without risk of sexual attack reaction : the march was organised after an @entity118 officer ' advised ' women not to wear short skirts date rapes , mr @entity69 insisted , ' vary extraordinarily from one to another '			1
in fact , the law makes no distinction between so - called date rapes or attacks by strangers			0
he was later forced to apologise but in subsequent appearances , he said a ' classic ' rape was when a stranger grabbed an ' unwilling ' woman from the street and should draw a sentence of ' ten years plus '			0
since the @entity7 movement began in 2011 , it has aimed to highlight a culture of blame aimed at victims of sex crime instead of the attackers			2
thousands of members of @entity7 have already marched in cities across the @entity142 and @entity15 to display anger at the original comments made by police officer @entity145 in a health and safety talk to students at @entity148 in @entity149			0
the @entity32 march in june from @entity151 to @entity152 was organised through @entity7 's @entity154 page and attended by around 5,000 people			1
worldwide : the @entity7 movement began in january last year after a @entity149 policeman said women should not dress like ' sluts ' if they wanted to avoid rape variety of costumes : some protesters wore jeans and t - shirts , while others wore a lot less last summer			2

rape campaigners say justice system must take sex crimes more seriously
