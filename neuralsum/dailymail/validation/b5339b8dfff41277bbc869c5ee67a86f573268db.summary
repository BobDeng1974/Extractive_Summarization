@entity1 spokesman @entity0 praised fans for the part they have played in forcing change at @entity5 before warning them : ' the hard work starts now			1
' the @entity1 and @entity8 , another group aimed at fan ownership , had amassed almost 19,000 registered members between them going into friday 's @entity11			1
a combination of shares purchased by each organisation , using cash raised from that backing and from proxies , saw them hold around 10 per cent of the voting power at the meeting			2
@entity1 fans gather outside @entity5 stadium to hear news from the extraordinary general meeting @entity1 spokesman @entity0 has praised fans ' role in changing the club @entity28 ( centre ) received almost 86 per cent of the votes from @entity1 shareholders for power at @entity5 fans show their delight for the incoming @entity1 board of @entity28 , @entity36 ( left ) and @entity37 ( right ) @entity0 is delighted the club 's followers have performed such a significant role in getting @entity28 , @entity37 and @entity36 on to the board and overthrowing previous incumbents @entity42 and @entity44 but insisted there is still much more to do			1
now he has urged supporters to keep investing in the two fan movements to ensure there is never a repeat of the financial turmoil experienced at @entity1 in recent years			1
' the response to both schemes has been amazing and it has been crucial , not just in winning the @entity11 but also in moving forward , ' he said			1
' it is important the fans want to have more of a shareholding in the club			2
i believe we can trust this board and i think they will run the club properly			1
' we do n't know what is going to happen in 10 years ' time , though , so it 's vital the fans have a big enough say to stop anything like we 've seen in the last three or four years from happening again			2
and if there is a new share issue i think it 's important they continue to up their shareholding to a more significant portion			2
' it has been brilliant seeing how people have risen to the challenge			0
the @entity1 has been plugging away at this for 12 years while @entity8 is a more recent thing			1
but , to be honest , it 's just great to see the fans getting behind the same objective , however they have chosen to do that			0
' what the supporters have done has been crucial in winning the vote and it will be crucial going forward			0
now it 's really important we get working as soon as possible			0
there will obviously be a couple of days of celebration but there 's going to be a huge rebuilding process at the club			2
' it has been ripped apart over the last few years so the priority is to get the hard work started straight away			0
some things can be done quickly and others will take a bit longer ' i can understand where @entity101 was coming from when he said it is going to take five years to fix the club			0
i think he was talking there about the football infrastructure and things such as scouting and youth development take a long time to come through if you start doing them properly			0
a @entity1 fan holds up a sign in protest against @entity115 , @entity42 and @entity44 just 15 per cent of the club 's shareholders voted to keep @entity118 ( pictured , centre ) and @entity44 at @entity5 ' but @entity28 was right , too , in the sense that there are things you can do in the short - term which would immediately improve the situation			1
even just getting the fans back in the stadium is an improvement because there 's increased revenue from that alone			0
on the football side , appointing a new manager will be an improvement and we 'll possibly be able to bring in players in the summer who can improve the squad			0
' what matters most is there are guys in the boardroom now who actually care about the club			0
they are n't just there to feather their own nests and that 's the difference			0
' although @entity42 and @entity44 are no longer on the board , they do remain employed by the club as chief executive and financial director respectively			1
severance deals must be struck and , although both men have dug their heels in this week , @entity0 thinks it 's only a matter of time until they are driven out of the club			1
' @entity44 and @entity42 can make it a little bit difficult in terms of getting them to leave and i 'm sure they will make it as hard as they can , ' he said			1
' they are obviously in this for themselves so they will try to get what they can out of the situation			0
' the @entity174 contract is obviously something which still needs to be looked at and there are big question marks over how a lot of contracts came to be latterly			1
that will need to be examined pretty closely but i do n't think there is anything that 's insurmountable as long as the people in the boardroom want to get it fixed			0
that 's the big difference			0
there 's nothing the club ca n't do as long as everybody is pulling in the one direction			2
' tackling the influence of @entity174 owner @entity115 ( pictured ) will be next on the @entity1 fans ' agenda			1

fan ownership groups amassed nearly 19,000 members before friday 's @entity11
over *85* per cent of @entity200 shareholders backed @entity28 's plans for @entity1
supporters helped to oust @entity42 and @entity44 from the board
@entity0 has praised the @entity1 and @entity8
however , he has warned there is still plenty of work to be done at the club
focus will be turned to the @entity174 contract and @entity115
