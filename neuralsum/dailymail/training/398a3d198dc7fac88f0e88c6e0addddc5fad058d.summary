they searched my house for drugs and alcohol			0
i was treated like a hardened criminal			0
’ @entity0 , who is divorced and lives with her children in @entity68 , was advised by a lawyer to accept a caution to avoid going to court and reassured it would remain on her records for only five years			1

@entity0 said she left her son at home while she went on a driving lesson
her son was home due to a school inset day and she had no other *option*
she said he was only at home for 45 minutes and he was 100 *percent* safe
@entity0 said she accepted a police caution for child cruelty back in 2006
she still has to reveal that caution to *potential* employers
her son , 14 , is now head boy of his school and has had football trials
