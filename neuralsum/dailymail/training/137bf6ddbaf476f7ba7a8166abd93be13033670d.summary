@entity1 scientists are now able to build crucial equipment for uranium - based nuclear bombs on their own , according to evidence gathered by two @entity7 experts			1
this cuts the need for imports , which had been one of the few ways outsiders could monitor the country 's secretive atomic work			0
the experts say material published in @entity1 scientific publications and news media shows that @entity20 is mastering domestic production of essential components for the gas centrifuges needed to make such bombs			1
@entity20 is mastering domestic production of essential components for the gas centrifuges needed to make such bombs : three file satellite images from 2012 show development of a building construction at @entity29 in @entity1 the development further complicates long - stalled efforts to stop a nuclear bomb programme that @entity20 has vowed to expand , despite international condemnation			1
if @entity20 can make crucial centrifuge parts at home , outsiders ca n't track sensitive imports			1
that could spell the end of policies based on export controls , sanctions and interdiction that have been the centerpiece of international efforts to stop @entity1 's nuclear program over the last decade , @entity38 , a @entity39 - based expert on nuclear proliferation , said			1
the remarks by mr @entity38 were prepared for delivery wednesday at a @entity53 symposium			2
satellite image shows the area around the @entity29 nuclear facility in @entity29 , @entity1 in 2012			0
the @entity58 image shows progress in construction of the containment building for the light - water reactor at the @entity29 facility , according to the institute			0
@entity1 scientists can produce components for the gas centrifuges needed to build uranium - based nuclear bombs ' if they 're not importing these goods in the first place , then we ca n't catch them in the act , ' he said			1
@entity38 gathered the evidence with @entity75 , an expert on centrifuge technology at the @entity77			0
' we wo n't necessarily see anything more than what the @entity1 want us to see , ' he added			0
the state of @entity1 's nuclear program is of vital concern to @entity39 , because @entity20 wants to build an arsenal of nuclear - armed missiles that can reach @entity7 shores			1
the @entity86 has conducted three nuclear tests of apparently increasing power since 2006 , most recently in february , and it is believed to have a handful of crude plutonium - based bombs			1
@entity20 is the capital of the @entity1 and the largest city in the country many experts estimate , however , that @entity20 has not yet mastered the miniaturisation technology needed to mount a warhead on a long - range missile			1
fuel for @entity1 's plutonium bombs has been made in a reactor that is large and easily monitored			2
but uranium - based weapons are more difficult for outsiders to investigate because the centrifuges needed to enrich uranium for bombs can be easily hidden away from satellites and prying inspectors			1
@entity1 soldiers march during a military parade marking the 65th anniversary of the country 's founding in @entity20 , @entity1 the @entity7 and others long suspected @entity1 was clandestinely building a uranium program , despite denials from @entity20			2
@entity7 officials confronted @entity1 in 2002 with claims its scientists were pursuing uranium enrichment , sparking a nuclear crisis			0
in a reversal , visiting @entity7 were shown in november 2010 what they called a sophisticated , modern uranium enrichment facility with 2,000 centrifuges at the @entity86 's main nuclear facility			2
international sanctions barring nuclear weapons related shipments to @entity1 did not stop its progress even when it relied on imported equipment			2
but the @entity7 had some success tracking the parts allegedly used in the program			0
in 2007 , then - @entity7 nuclear envoy @entity136 said @entity39 had evidence that @entity20 had bought equipment used only for uranium enrichment			1
the @entity29 nuclear complex in @entity29 back in 2010 - heavy construction and excavation equipment at the site and the construction of two small buildings news media reports and unclassified government documents showed @entity1 imported large amounts of centrifuge parts in the early 2000s , @entity38 said			0
but an apparent dearth of observed imports since the early 2000s suggests that @entity20 is making the necessary components at home			2
he said the know - how for domestic production of key parts appears to have been in place no later than 2009			1
@entity38 said he and @entity75 found ' strong and clear ' evidence in state media photographs taken inside @entity1 factories of specialised lathes that produce very strong metal cylinders needed for centrifuges			2
@entity164 of @entity1 : @entity165 speaking during a plenary meeting of the @entity167 of the @entity168 in @entity20 he also spoke of accounts in @entity1 propaganda and technical journals of iron and steel - making consistent with the production of an extremely hard steel alloy that can resist high rotational speeds in centrifuges , although the final step of the process was n't described			1
@entity38 said their research also found scientific reports and patent awards describing work on technologies for crucial centrifuge parts			0
those include vacuum pumps that remove air from centrifuges and pipes before uranium - bearing gas is added and electronic devices that control the speed of the electric motor in the base of each centrifuge			0
@entity1 's nuclear program is cloaked in secrecy and treated domestically as a national treasure			0
the small , impoverished country says it must defend itself from @entity7 machinations to overthrow its political system			0
it 's not clear whether @entity1 has made bomb - grade uranium , and @entity20 says the program is for peaceful , energy - generating purposes			0
but analysts strongly suspect that , even beyond the facility @entity7 toured in 2010 , @entity20 has other uranium enrichment facilities that could be producing large amounts of weapons - grade material			0
earlier this year , during a barrage of threats aimed at @entity39 and @entity53 , @entity20 vowed to resume all its nuclear fuel production			1
recent satellite imagery appears to show that @entity1 was restarting its plutonium reactor .			0
