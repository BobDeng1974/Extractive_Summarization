by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 is the latest talent to come off the @entity5 production line and the club 's under 21s manager @entity6 has seen the midfielder 's remarkable rise first hand			1
both boyhood @entity11 , ' @entity10 ' believes it was just a matter of time before @entity2 made it and hopes the youngster is selected in @entity19 's 23 - man @entity17 squad for this summer 's @entity20 in @entity21			1
@entity22 spoke to the @entity5 coach about @entity2 's breakthrough , @entity5 's up - and - coming academy stars and the club 's famous ' school of science '			1
one to watch : @entity2 is the latest talented youngster to come though the @entity5 production line @entity29 : @entity30 21s manager @entity6 spoke to @entity31 about the club 's impressive academy @entity34 knew all about @entity2 before he burst onto the scene in the @entity36 this season			1
did you expect him to have such an impact ? yeah , i did ( laughs )			2
@entity2 has had a big impact			1
i coached him for two or three years and he always stood out and has fantastic ability			0
it has to be said the season he ’s having comes two years on from breaking his leg			0
@entity2 may have made the breakthrough even earlier but for the injury			1
whether it was this season or last , it was only a matter of time before he made it			0
flying high : @entity6 has n't been surprised by the huge impact @entity2 has made at @entity54 this season proud : @entity2 , pictured with @entity55 ( left ) , scooped @entity5 's @entity56 of the season award do you think @entity2 will make into @entity19 ’s 23 - man @entity17 squad this summer and help lead the nation to @entity20 glory ? for @entity2 to go to @entity21 with @entity17 would be fantastic			1
how many 20 - year - old lads can say they ’ve been to the @entity20 ? for me , not only as an @entity5 but also as an @entity17 fan it would be good to see him selected – i ’ve been waiting for @entity17 to win the @entity20 since 1971 ! it ’s @entity19 ’s decision whether or not he ’ll play and we have to respect that			1
international : @entity2 has been tipped to make @entity19 's @entity17 squad for this summer 's @entity20 @entity5 have seen a number of talented youngsters make a name for themselves after coming through the ranks			1
notably @entity75 and now @entity2			1
what ’s the club ’s secret ? i think the biggest thing is the infrastructure at the club – the scouting , coaching and development of players			2
i think you also need that ‘ luck ’ element , too , to have players like @entity75 and @entity2			2
@entity5 ’s record over the years and the number of players brought through speaks volumes			2
@entity95 was named @entity5 ’s under - 21s player of the season at the club ’s @entity98 on wednesday night			1
how close is he to breaking into the first - team ? @entity95 has progressed at a real rate of knots and i think he ’s close			0
he just needs to keep doing what he ’s been doing and has a great opportunity of breaking into that first - team			0
once a @entity29 , always a @entity106 : @entity75 began his career with @entity5 before moving to @entity108 progress : @entity6 believes young defender @entity95 is close to breaking into the @entity5 first - team young midfielder @entity111 also picked up an award and was named @entity113 ... @entity111 ’s the baby , he ’s only 16 but has been a real credit to himself			1
he ’s made a few appearances for the @entity30 21s this season and for us that ’s a bonus			0
sometimes you can be a bit cautious about the impact playing in those games can have but , physically , he ’s coped			2
@entity111 ’s one of a number of bright young players at @entity5			2
real credit : @entity5 's @entity111 is one of a number of bright young players coming through the ranks meanwhile , @entity129 scooped the main awards being named @entity131 as well as the @entity132			1
aged 20 when he joined the club in 2009 , the @entity133 international has had an excellent campaign ... in all honesty , nobody in their wildest dreams could have envisaged what @entity129 has gone on to achieve when we first signed him for £ 60,000 from @entity143			2
all credit to @entity5 for scouting him			2
the club took a chance and he ’s been a revelation			2
he ’s a modern day full back ; can score goals , attack and is a real handful			0
all smiles : @entity129 is congratulated by @entity154 after winning @entity132 of the season class act : @entity129 is a modern day full back , scoring goals and being able to attack , according to @entity6 @entity5 have had to deal with a number of injuries towards the end of this season meaning @entity95 , @entity111 and @entity162 have all made appearances on the bench			1
what advice do you give the younger players when they ’re given the nod ? i tell them to go and enjoy it but to not forget the reasons which got them there			0
the fact you ’re on the bench does n’t mean you ’ve made it			0
it ’s the first step in a long process			0
you do n’t stop learning in football until the day you retire			0
with @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity184 and yourself all coaching at the club 's @entity186 training ground , there is a real core of @entity11 legends currently back working at @entity5			1
do you think this benefits the club 's young players ? i think it can only be beneficial to see the likes of @entity183 ( under 18s manager ) , @entity182 ( first - team coach ) , @entity184 ( under 21s assistant ) and myself working at the club			1
we ’ve been there , done it , lived the dream and it goes a long way			0
we ’re not just there on a name alone , though			0
we have to be good coaches and are there because we ’re doing something right			0
club legend : @entity182 is a hero at @entity54 and became an @entity5 first - team coach this season making a point : former @entity5 defender @entity184 ( left ) is assistant to @entity6 with the @entity214 helping hand : @entity6 believes having legends like @entity183 as coaches benefits the club 's young players you spoke to @entity5 chairman @entity221 in the summer about the vacant manager ’s job before @entity224 was appointed as the club ’s new boss ... yeah , i spoke to the chairman and we had an informal chat			1
it ’s an ambition of mine and something i want to do in the future and i will be a manager one day			0
@entity5 have enjoyed a brilliant season under @entity224 despite some fans being worried when the @entity237 first arrived at @entity54			1
did you expect the club to perform so well this season ? i think you can be a bit wary when a new manager comes in and have to expect a bit of a transitional period			0
we could have perhaps looked and thought : ‘ we ’ll take eighth place , aim for a top ten finish , ’ but we ’re fifth and the manager has done very well			0
impressive : @entity224 has enjoyed an excellent campaign during his first season as @entity5 manager ambition : @entity6 insists he will go into club management one day having been interviewed for the @entity5 job talks : @entity6 had an informal chat with chairman @entity221 before @entity224 was appointed as boss @entity34 have often been heard singing ‘ @entity5 , is on its way back ’ this season , harking back to the positive brand of football played by past @entity5 sides			1
do you try to get the youngsters playing ' the @entity5 way ' , too ? we always want the lads to play football			2
we ’ve never been direct and instead try to play			0
that philosophy has always been part of the club but i think @entity224 has reinforced it			1
the players are playing in a positive environment and we try to educate them			0
at @entity5 , the ‘ @entity5 ’ was always at the forefront during the 60s , 70s and 80s and now it ’s back			2
hopefully we can maintain it in the 21st century			0
with @entity224 at the helm and the talented youngsters coming through , how far can @entity5 go ? it ’s difficult to put a finger on it but we have to aim to get as high as we can			1
we ’ve made good strides this season and have some fantastic players at the club			0
moving in the right direction : @entity6 believes @entity5 have made great strides and have some fantastic players school of science : @entity5 fans have unfurled this flag at recent matches , reveling in the club 's exciting play @entity6 was speaking at a @entity299 event , where two amateur football teams were given the opportunity to play at @entity5 's @entity54 by @entity299			1
this season @entity299 is thanking fans , community heroes , players and managers for making the @entity36 what it is			0

@entity6 not surprised by impact @entity2 has had at @entity5
