impact : researchers say that while there has been much talk of the impact on the housing market of the government 's help to buy scheme , overall sales supported by help to buy are ' relatively small ' ' the real driver of higher house prices is record low mortgage rates and strong demand from first - time buyers and investors who have no property to sell , which is compounding scarcity , ' he said			1
