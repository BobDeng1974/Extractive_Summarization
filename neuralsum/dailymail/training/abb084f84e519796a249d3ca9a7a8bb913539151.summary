the @entity0 are the @entity2 's youngest roster			1
an error - strewn performance saw missed tackles galore and three turnovers , one from a muffed punt inside their own 10 - yard line			1
arguably it turned the game			2
the @entity12 were 7 - 3 up and had reduced @entity13 , playing with two fractured vertebrae , to a field goal from his opening two drives			1
@entity17 muffs @entity19 ' punt in the first quarter to hand the ball back to @entity22 and sap momentum the hardened veteran was not in the mood to return the charity			1
he looked calm in the red zone , gingerly rolling to his right on third down , finding @entity30 with a two - yard pass			1
the score was the first of 28 unanswered points , and the game was over as a contest by half - time			1
punt returner @entity17 was honest in his appraisal , saying : ' the ball slipped through my fingers			1
you need to secure the ball first and then worry about what comes next			2
and i did n't do that			2
it was very out of character			2
i need to make some adjustments			2
' it definitely happens , but at the same time , you never want it to			0
' @entity52 focuses on the game but @entity0 suffered their second defeat in two years in @entity56 coach @entity52 appeared frustrated at seeing the same mistakes , week - in , week - out			1
' i do n't have any real concerns with our effort , with our courage , with our toughness			0
it 's just those self inflicted things , and it 's just focus , concentration , whatever the case is			0
those things , i think are what causes some frustration , ' a particular problem is the inability to tackle , as @entity52 continued			0
' well , it was n't very good right away in the first half			0
i do n't know how many we missed , but it disappeared			1
' @entity13 was protected by his offensive line magnificently , with @entity12 recording just one sack @entity79 burned the @entity12 ' defense on two long touchdown passes , beating man coverage , finding space at will and skipping hapless attempts to stop him			1
for his second score , a 68 - yarder just before the break , he carried safety @entity88 for the last 10 yards			1
' yes , i took a bad angle			0
i took a bad angle , and instead of just trying to get him out of bounds , i reached for him , kind of put the ball this way			0
it does n't matter , i missed him , and that ca n't happen , ' a dejected @entity88 said			1
with rookie quarterback @entity100 under center , it is bound to be a year of ups and downs			2
he started the game excellently , finding @entity105 and @entity106 before @entity107 went over from 33 yards			0
@entity100 spoke of the undulating nature of his youthful side			0
' i mean , the first drive we went down was a really good drive			0
the offensive line did well			0
@entity106 had a play and @entity107 broke a big run			0
we came back the second drive and hurt ourselves with the penalty and kind of shot ourselves in the foot for two or three drives after that and never really could get it rolling again			0
' as they fly home to @entity122 , the @entity12 are 1 - 9 for the third straight season			1
and with their propensity to shoot themselves in the foot , it is tough to see where their next victory will come from .			0

the @entity0 lost *31* - *16* to the @entity1*31* in a one - sided affair at @entity133
the @entity12 did not recover from @entity17 ' muffed punt in the first quarter
missed tackles , rookie mistakes and three turnovers did not help
the @entity12 move to 1 - 9 and travel to the @entity141 after a bye week
