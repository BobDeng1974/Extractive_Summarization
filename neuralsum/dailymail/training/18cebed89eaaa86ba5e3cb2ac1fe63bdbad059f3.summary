through war and peace , in sickness and in health , they have been man and wife for 75 years			1
so any little tip that @entity7 , 98 , and wife @entity8 , 99 , might care to impart about the secret of a long and happy partnership must surely be worth its weight in gold , pearls , rubies , silver and diamonds			1
and the advice is ? ‘ @entity18 , ’ said mrs @entity19			0
‘ @entity18 lots but always remember to get over it			0
’ everlasting love : @entity7 and @entity19 on their wedding day in 1939 ( left ) and now , 81 years after they met ( right ) it may go against convention , but it seems to have worked for this couple			1
they have just celebrated 75 years of marriage – and 81 years as a couple – and are still arguing as they approach their 100th birthdays			1
believed to be @entity36 ’s longest - married couple , they have long since stopped counting the number of the times they kissed and made up after a tiff			2
‘ people always have arguments , ’ says the delightfully no - nonsense mrs @entity19			2
‘ in 75 years we ’re going to have had a lot – but the key is to move on			2
it ’s never worth stewing over			0
’ the former mill worker and her husband also shared their thoughts on how many of the younger generation appear to rush into commitment			0
@entity7 and @entity19 recently celebrated their 75th wedding anniversary			1
they met at a dance hall in 1933 but were then separated for six years when @entity7 was in @entity56 during @entity57 ‘ @entity58 move in together not really knowing what they want from each other , ’ mrs @entity19 said			1
‘ if you ’re going to move in with someone , or marry them , you have to know you love them			1
everyone is getting divorced these days			0
they have quick marriages and i just think people do not have what they want			0
’ mr @entity7 added : ‘ when we were young , people just stuck together – but back then we had courtship , and that has gone by the wayside			2
‘ a quick wedding was n’t done in those days and a long engagement gave you time to get to know each other and know if the other person was the one you wanted			0
’ the couple met 81 years ago and have enjoyed many happy moments			1
pictured , left , on holiday in 1985 and , right , before @entity7 left for war in 1939 @entity84 was on the throne when @entity7 and @entity8 met in 1933 and @entity86 was rising to power in @entity88			1
@entity89 wowed cinema audiences with the latest advances in special effects , and – crucially for these sweethearts – the @entity95 bar was new to the @entity36			0
it might have helped this particular courtship that @entity7 , then a 16 - year - old financial worker , clearly knew the best way to a girl ’s heart			1
he asked her for a dance at the local hop , took her on a romantic walk – and bought her a @entity95 bar			2
it turned out to be the shrewdest investment he ever made			0
‘ he just charmed me off my feet , ’ mrs @entity19 recalled			0
‘ he was from a posh family and we were really poor			0
after that we fell in love			2
’ the wedding day in 1939 : the pair only married after 6 years together and @entity8 says moving in together too quickly could be one of the reasons for today 's high divorce rates the couple looking a decade younger than their years on @entity8 's 90th birthday ( left ) and outside their house in the late 90s ( right ) emerging from the church in 1939 on their wedding day ( left ) and on holiday in @entity127 in 1951 ( right )			1

mr @entity7 fought in the @entity141 desert campaign			2
for six years they did not see each other but exchanged regular love letters			2
mrs @entity19 looked forward to them dropping on the mat but spent every day dreading an official letter saying something had happened to her sweetheart			0
by the time @entity7 came home in 1945 he had lost all his blond hair and his wife barely recognised him when she met him at the station			1

‘ we have n’t been separated since			2
we still love each other			0
’ the couple now live in sheltered accommodation near where they met in @entity173 , where they host bingo nights and go to fitness classes			0
they have two children , two step - grandchildren and a step - great - granddaughter			1
@entity129 , 68 , said : ‘ they try really hard , but no relationship is perfect			1
my mum gets fed up when my dad falls asleep and she ends up throwing a shoe at him			0
my dad gets annoyed when my mum is impatient			0
these days there are benefits for single mums but back then there were n’t , so you had no choice but to try			0
my parents hit the jackpot though			0
