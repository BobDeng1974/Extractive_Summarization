a large footprint unlike one from a human or bear has been found in the woods in @entity5 - raising suggestions that the creature it belongs to is @entity7			1
the large print was found by @entity9 in @entity10 on august 12 - nine months after another local man , @entity11 , saw a large grey figure running through a wooded area nearby			1
@entity9 had been working on an air conditioner 400 yards from an abandoned playground that borders the woods when he came across the footprint and made a cast of it			1
the cast - which trapped white - gray hairs from the animal - measures nine inches long and is almost six inches wide at the toes , the @entity19 reported			1
discovery : @entity9 shows the cast he made from a large footprint he found near to a wooded area in @entity10 , @entity5			1
he said the ridges on the footprint mean it was not made by a bear found : @entity9 , right , contacted paranormal investigator @entity11 , left , after making the discovery last month and learned that @entity33 had seen a mysterious gray figure in the woods last year ' that right there is n't human , ' @entity9 told @entity38 , pointing to the print			1
not only does the color of the hair fail to match a bear 's , but he also noted there were fingerprint - like ridges in the cast - a feature found only on humans and primates , he said			1
' i have no knowledge of what made it , and i did n't see what made it , but it 's very intriguing , ' he said			0
he contacted @entity33 , co-founder of the @entity54 , when he saw his truck marked with the project 's logo			2
on speaking to him , he learned @entity33 could have seen the creature responsible for the print			0
' we were just blown away , ' @entity9 told the @entity61			0
' that kind of brought some clarity to what we were dealing with			0
in other words , it raised additional questions			0
' found : the cast also pulled out a gray - white hair from the footprint , suggesting it was not a bear sighting : @entity33 said last november he saw the six - foot - tall creature see him and then dash into the woods scene : the sightings occurred near this run - down playground , an area where hunting is not allowed @entity33 explained that he had seen the creature as he tried to film some paranormal activity at the playground , claiming he had previously heard children 's voices there			1
instead , he said he heard a crashing noise in the woods - and was stunned by what he saw : a 6ft - tall creature running through the woods			1
' it was definitely a shaggy coat to it , like a grayish - brown color , ' he said			2
' when it made the noise that spooked me , i looked over , and it looked like it stood up and just bolted off			0
' he said that it happened so quickly that he did not have the chance to take pictures			0
while he has long hunted for paranormal activity - even appearing on network @entity104 with his finds - he would not say whether he believed it could be @entity7			2
search : @entity33 ' group , @entity109 , is now investigating the area further but ' if you have a piece of physical evidence such as this it 's definitely worth not totally ruling out ' , @entity9 told @entity116			2
both men agree that whatever it is , it must be smart enough to have avoided being seen			0
@entity9 said he has found previously recorded sights in the area , reaching from 1721 , when a priest wrote about seeing a huge human - like creature in @entity125			0
the @entity126 is now planning to investigate the area further .			0

@entity129 *spotted* a nine inch by six inch footprint in @entity131 , @entity5 in august and took a cast of it
he believes ridges and a gray hair on the cast prove it is not from a bear
he contacted a paranormal group and its co-founders @entity11 revealed he had seen a six - foot - tall gray figure in the woods last year
the men are now investigating the woods further to search for answers
