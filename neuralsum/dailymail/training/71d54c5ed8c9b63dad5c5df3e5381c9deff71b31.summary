when @entity1 launched 34 years ago , founder @entity0 vowed that the station would broadcast the news 24 hours a day until @entity4			1
therefore , anticipating that at one point the apocalypse would come , he is believed to have created a segment that would be shown as the cable channel signed off for the final time			1
the clip that would supposedly be played to the last people watching the station is a minute - long version of the 19th century hymn ' nearer my @entity15 to thee ' performed by the @entity19 marching bands			1
according to @entity21 , it is stored on @entity1 's @entity23 archive and was initially edited to fit on cathode - ray tvs popular in the 1980s			1
' @entity38 , who was an intern in 2009 for @entity40 's program @entity41 , said he was first told about the video by a college professor who had worked at @entity1 for 20 years			2
according to an article he wrote for @entity21 , he said the clip turned up on a database when he searched for ' @entity47 '			2
he has since managed to get hold of the footage and has posted it online			2
rumors of the doomsday tape 's existence have been reported many times over the last 25 years			2
in 1988 , it was included in an article published in the @entity57 , and as late as 2001 , in the @entity58			0
he told the @entity57 : normally , when a tv station begins & ends the broacast day , it signs on & off by playing the @entity63			0
' but with @entity1 - a 24 - hour - a day channel - we would only sign off once and i knew what that would mean			1
so we got the combined @entity19 marching bands together – the @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 & @entity74 bands – & took them out to the old @entity1 headquarters & we had them practice the @entity63 for a videotaping			0
' then , as things cranked up , i asked if they 'd play " nearer my @entity15 , to @entity78 " to put on videotape just in case the world ever came to an end			1
that would be the last thing @entity1 played before we – before we signed off			0
' i ca n't watch this without getting tears in my eyes			0
' i keep this tape around because when the world ends it 'll be over before we can say what we wanted to say			0
before we can leave any final messages			0
' @entity92 have contacted @entity1 for comment			0
born as part of @entity0 's @entity95 , in 1996 it became a part of @entity97			1
in 2000 @entity98 bought @entity97 for $ 164 billion , and in 2006 @entity0 himself left the @entity97 board			1
in 2009 , @entity98 was spun off from the company it once attempted to dominate			0
an intern said that he got hold of the video when he searched for it on a database			0
it is believed to be behind red letters saying : the site 's founder @entity0 said the channel would keep broadcasting until the world ended when it was founded in 1974			1
