children shrieked in disgust as removal men tore the tail off a whale carcass in a botched attempt to take it from the beach where it had washed up			2
it took 20 helpers and two industrial diggers to haul the 20 - tonne southern right whale on to a flatbed truck , before being driven to a landfill site			1
the clean - up job was captured by @entity16 photographer @entity15 , 30 , at @entity17 outside @entity18 , @entity19 , against a backdrop of the city 's distinctive @entity21			1
a whale carcass lies beached near @entity18 , @entity19 : it is thought that the 20 - tonne southern right whale washed ashore after being hit by a boat dead : the whale 's tongue lolls out as water laps against its lifeless body and a digger approaches to begin the process of carrying it away huge : the massive marine mammal weighed 20 tonnes and was 10 metres long a lonely figure : @entity18 's @entity21 can be seen rising majestically on the horizon behind the whale carcass unusual sight : curious passers - by gathered to gawp at the dead beast and take photographs of their own behemoth : a girl stands by the carcass , her small frame showing in comparison the massive size of the massive animal frolicking : children run near to the whale carcass , before removal men accidentally ripped off its tail and turned everyone 's stomachs close up view : photographer @entity15 did n't describe the smell of the dead whale , but it 's probably safe to assume that it was n't very pleasant scavengers : sea gulls circle overhead , perhaps hoping to get a beak - full of putrefying whale blubber for breakfast he said : ' when i arrived a small crowd had gathered around the beached male			1
a few minutes after i arrived , representatives from the @entity70 authorities arrived and set up a cordon			0
' the authorities got to work right away to get the whale off the beach			0
' but one botched attempt involved trying to drag the poor beast from its tail but it ended in the lifting strop tearing through the tail , pulling it clean off with a disturbing guttural sound , followed by screams of horror from all the on - looking children			0
' after three hours the 10m - long whale was eventually lifted on to the flatbed and driven away to be disposed of			2
here come the fuzz : a member of the local ' @entity88 ' spies the dead whale lying forlornly on the practically empty beach heavy duty equipment : a building site digger approaches the whale carcass as clean up crews prepare to push it towards the nearby road to be taken away get ready to push : the digger closes in on the massive corpse reinforcements : it eventually takes two diggers to roll the dead creature up the beach to where it can be taken away oops : workmen from the clean - up crewget ready to haul the whale carcass onto a flatbed truck , it appears that this photo was taken shortly after they ripped off its tail to me ... to you : the dead creature is winched on to the flatbed as a digger pushes from behind ready to go : the whale is finally loaded on to the truck and ready to be taken a way rest in peace ... all loaded up on to its makeshift hearse , the whale is ready to be transported to its final resting place - the local landfill site mr @entity15 , from @entity125 , @entity126 , believes fishermen or an accident may have killed the animal			1
he added : ' someone who saw it when it first washed up said it had a lot of line on it , perhaps from nets , so it could have been an entanglement or a combination of entanglement and a ship strike			0
' according to folklore , the explanation for the right whale 's name is that they were the ' right ' ones to hunt , because they float when killed and often swim within sight of the shore .			0
