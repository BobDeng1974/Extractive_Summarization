headmistress @entity0 said the rise of social media meant every action taken by a parent is now subject to ' global scrutiny ' @entity7 and @entity8 are creating a generation of parents afraid to discipline their teenage children in case they are then embarrassed on social media , a leading headmistress warned yesterday			1
teenagers are increasingly refusing to back down in rows with mothers and fathers as friends egg them on via social networking sites , according to @entity0 , president of the @entity20			1
parents are becoming ' less bold and intuitive ' when disciplining adolescents amid fears that family disputes will be broadcast to hundreds of the youngsters ' friends online , she warned			2
whereas children might previously have reflected alone in their bedrooms and ' moved on ' , they were now more likely to ' continue the fight ' in cahoots with their online allies			2
mrs @entity0 argued in a speech to the @entity20 annual conference in @entity34 that parenting is now more difficult than ever before because of money worries and the pressure of domestic disputes being put under ' global scrutiny '			1
schools should consider giving parents classes to help them ' hold the line ' after making decisions that are unpopular with their children , she added			1
her warning comes days after a large @entity48 study of 13 - year - olds found they increasingly spend time alone at home instead of being out with friends			0
a portrait of today 's 13 - year - olds found that social networking sites were eclipsing personal contact with friends after school and at weekends			2
nearly half of girls – 47 per cent – reported using social networking or instant messaging sites ' throughout the day ' and 30 per cent of boys			0
mrs @entity0 , of @entity66 , a private girls ' school near @entity64 , @entity65 , told the conference of her concern for parents			1
' i find myself increasingly wanting to reach out to them as i believe that parenting has never been as difficult as it is today , ' she said			0
' why ? because one 's instincts are constantly challenged and spontaneous confidence dissolves			2
parents are becoming less bold and intuitive in parenting adolescents			2
' today , social media means they are conscious that their every action is the subject of global scrutiny			1
' children , as grumpy as any of us were when given the answer no , retreat in the same way to their bedrooms but instead of reflecting for a while to blaring music , broadcast their parents ' apparently unreasonable behaviour to all their @entity7 friends , or @entity8 followers , whose own parents are apparently also ' completely out of touch '			0
' where once they might have taken time out to come to their senses , apologise and ' move on ' , now they are more likely to continue the fight			0
' children are choosing to share their anger with friends online instead of sulking in their bedrooms , which means that parents are constantly left questioning their decisions ( stock image ) mrs @entity0 also said she was constantly forced to use the phrase ' a mother 's place is in the wrong ' to reassure parents whose daughters were competing ' for the place of alpha females '			1
' nonetheless , it takes courage and a long time these days to stay out there ' in the wrong ' until your teen gradually realises that you are in fact dependable , wise and ' in the right ' , ' she said			0
some parents ' even start to believe all that their distressed children say ' and anxious mothers and fathers may then ' turn on ' teachers instead of calling on them for help or support			0
schools should consider offering ' structured and reassuring courses ' on what parents should expect at each stage of their child 's development			0
' can we supplement the routine formula of parents ' evenings which have the aura of speed dating – without the excitement – with something more informal that facilitates dialogue between parents who may often feel isolated in making big decisions or holding the unpopular line ? ' mrs @entity0 said parents faced further worries over university fees and homes and jobs for their children			1
' is it any surprise that parents who are anxious to support their children feel they are not as empowered as once they were ? '			0

@entity0 said social media had made parenting harder than ever
head of @entity159 's school in @entity65 said children share anger online
said this compared to days when children vented *frustration* in their rooms
this has meant parents are constantly left questioning their decisions
