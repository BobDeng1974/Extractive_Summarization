seventeen months have passed since @entity0 gave @entity1 the fright of his life in their light - heavyweight title clash in @entity6			1
in the intervening period , the champion has beaten @entity9 , scrapped with @entity10 in and outside the @entity11 and tested positive for cocaine			0
but on saturday night , @entity0 finally has the chance to earn the rematch he so craves			1
@entity0 ( left ) and @entity15 square up after weighing in for their fight in @entity18 the fight will take place in front of 30,000 fans at the @entity23 in @entity24 on saturday night victory for @entity0 will earn him another shot at champion @entity1 who he pushed close in 2013 the @entity18 takes on a resurgent @entity15 in front of a staggering 30,000 fans in @entity24 having fought just once – a second - round stoppage win over @entity30 in @entity31 last march – since losing one of the greatest nights in @entity35 history			1
@entity0 knows that victory will guarantee him a second shot at @entity1 after injury robbed him of that opportunity last september			1
predictably , the 28 - year - old has been reluctant to look beyond @entity15 this week , saying simply : ‘ i do n't think much about @entity1 at the moment			1
it 's all about @entity15			1
’ and so it is			0
@entity15 ’s first spell with the @entity35 ended in a first - round submission defeat to @entity46 three years ago			1
‘ when i got cut after fighting @entity46 , i knew i had to get my act together , ’ he says			0
' me and my trainer were flying back from @entity51 and we had a couple of cups of wine and started talking about what we were going to do			0
‘ so far we 've kept our word and things have been working out			0
’ @entity15 has impressed since returning to the @entity35 last year , seen here beating @entity59 in @entity60 @entity15 then beat @entity61 to earn himself a shot at @entity63 after years of struggling to make weight , @entity15 returned at 205lb and dominated @entity59 over three rounds before taking just 44 seconds to knock out @entity61 last summer			1
‘ i did n't expect to be in this position , ’ he admits			0
‘ i knew i would be somewhere but i did n't think i 'd be where i am right now			0
' @entity67 inside i 've always known i had the talent to be the best so being in this situation does n't surprise me but i did n't think it would come so fast			0
' not that @entity15 ’s return has been completely smooth , however			1
the 30 - year - old was suspended last september following an accusation of domestic violence			2
it was later lifted following the dismissal of the civil case			0
and while he too could be just 25 minutes from a title shot , @entity15 is focused only on the job at hand			2
‘ everyone keeps talking about @entity1 but i do n't look that far ahead , ’ he says			2
‘ right now , i 'm just focusing on @entity84			0
@entity0 has not fought since he stopped @entity30 in the second round in @entity31 last march ‘ @entity86 is a tough opponent			2
this is a pretty even match up i think though			0
something crazy is going to happen that 's for sure			0
do n't be surprised by anything you see on the night			2
‘ i 'm calm , cool and relaxed			0
‘ with the calibre of athlete that @entity86 is , and the calibre of athlete that i am , you can expect a huge fight			2
’ @entity0 , meanwhile , believes his speed will give him the edge and that fighting at the magnificent @entity23 is a ‘ dream ’			1
‘ from not fighting @entity1 to fighting @entity15 in this venue that is huge is not bad and i ca n't complain , ’ he adds			1
but whether he likes it or not , @entity1 will be the name on everyone ’s lips come the final bell on saturday .			1

@entity0 has waited almost 18 months for @entity1 rematch
the @entity18 will earn it if he beats @entity15 on saturday night
the fight is being held at the 30,000 - *capacity* @entity23 in @entity24
@entity15 has won his first two fights since his return to the @entity35 last year
