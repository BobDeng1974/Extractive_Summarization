by @entity1 reporter published : 16:06 est , 12 march 2013 updated : 16:12 est , 12 march 2013 it was n't too long ago that @entity3 had a love affair with soda			2
now , an old flame has the country 's heart			0
as @entity10 grapples with the legality of a ban on the sale of large cups of soda and other sugary drinks at some businesses , one thing is clear : soda 's run as the nation 's beverage of choice has fizzled			0
in its place ? a favorite for much of history : plain old @entity27			0
new favorite : over the years , as soda increasingly came under fire for fueling the nation 's rising obesity rates , water quietly rose to knock it off the top spot as @entity3 ' favorite drink for more than two decades , soda was the no. 1 drink in the @entity3 with per capita consumption peaking in 1998 at 54 gallons a year , according industry tracker @entity40			1
@entity3 drank just 42 gallons a year of water at the time			1
but over the years , as soda increasingly came under fire for fueling the nation 's rising obesity rates , water quietly rose to knock it off the top spot			0
@entity3 now drink an average of 44 gallons of soda a year , a 17 percent drop from the peak in 1998			1
over the same time , the average amount of water people drink has increased 38 percent to about 58 gallons a year			1
bottled water has led that growth , with consumption nearly doubling to 21 gallons a year			1
@entity58 , a civil defense attorney , quit drinking soda a year ago when he started running triathlons , and wanted a healthier way to quench his thirst			0
@entity58 , 34 , has a @entity64 filter for tap water and also keeps his pantry stocked with cases of bottled water			2
' it might just be the placebo effect or marketing , but it tastes crisper , ' said @entity58 , who lives in @entity72			0
the trend reflects @entity3 ' ever - changing tastes ; it was n't too far back in history that tap water was the top drink			2
but in the 1980s , carbonated soft drinks overtook tap as the most popular drink , with @entity80 and @entity81 putting their marketing muscle behind their colas with celebrity endorsements from the likes of pop star @entity86 and comedian @entity87			1
@entity3 kept drinking more of the carbonated , sugary drink for about a decade			2
then , soda 's magic started to fade : everyone from doctors to health advocates to government officials were blaming soft drinks for making people fat			1
consumption started declining after hitting a high in the late 1990s			0
sugar high : for more than two decades , soda was the no. 1 drink in the @entity3 with per capita consumption peaking in 1998 at 54 gallons a year at the same time , people started turning to bottled water as an alternative			1
its popularity was helped by the emergence of single - serve bottles that were easy to carry around			0
until then , bottled water had mainly been sold in ' big jugs and coolers ' for people who did n't trust their water supply , said @entity113 , publisher of @entity40			1
the new soft drink - like packaging helped fast - track bottled water 's growth past milk and beer			1
in fact , the amount of bottled water @entity3 drink has risen nearly every year for more than two decades , while the estimates of how much tap water people drink has fluctuated up and down during that time			1
when taken together , water finally overtook soda in 2008 , according to @entity40			0
( it 's difficult to track how much tap water people drink and how much is used for other things like washing dishes , so experts estimate consumption			1
) analysts expect water to hold onto to its top spot for years to come			0
but whether people will drink from the tap or a bottle is uncertain			0
based on current trajectories , @entity137 , the ceo of the industry tracker @entity139 , predicts that bottled water alone could overtake soda within the next decade			1
that 's not counting enhanced and flavored waters , which are growing quickly but remain a small part of the bottled water industry			2
currently , people drink 21 gallons of bottled water a year			1
that compares with 37 gallons of other water , which includes tap , sparkling , flavored and enhanced waters such as @entity80 's vitaminwater			0
but there are numerous factors that could tilt the scales in favor of tap water			0
based on current trajectories , @entity137 , the ceo of the industry tracker @entity139 , predicts that bottled water alone could overtake soda within the next decade because of concerns that plastic bottles create too much waste , experts say bottled water could be hit by a public backlash similar to the one that has whipsawed the soda industry with pushes for bans and taxes			1
@entity10 was preparing for a ban on cups of sugary drinks that are larger than 16 ounces starting on tuesday			0
but on monday — a day before the ban was to begin — a judge invalidated the regulation			0
mayor @entity181 , who originally proposed the ban , vowed to appeal the judge 's ruling			0
bottled water already is starting to face similar opposition			2
the town of @entity188 , @entity189 earlier this year banned the sale of water bottles that are less than a liter			0
and the @entity193 became the first public university to ban the sale of bottled water			2
meanwhile , other cities are waging campaigns to promote tap water			0
@entity10 , which touts the high quality of its tap water , offers portable fountains at events around the city			0
' good old marketing has convinced people that they should spend a lot of money on bottled water , ' says @entity209 , chief of @entity10 's distribution water quality operations			1
although companies such as @entity214 and @entity81 would rather have people buy bottled waters , they 're even more invested in getting people to drink more soda again			2
that 's because soda and other drinks that the companies make , such as sports drinks and juices , are more profitable than bottled water			1
with bottled water , people tend to buy whatever is cheapest			1
that 's a habit that forces companies to keep prices relatively low , which eats into profits			0
it 's why companies are investing so heavily in developing nations such as @entity231 and @entity232 , where the appetite for soda continues to grow			0
in the @entity3 , annual soda sales are more than five times as big as bottled water at $ 75.7 billion a year , according to @entity40			1
in terms of volume , soda is only twice as big as bottled water			1
at @entity80 , the no. 1 soda maker , three - quarters of its volume in gallons comes from soft drinks , compared with 8 percent for its bottled waters including @entity247			1
@entity81 , the no. 2 soda maker , gets 64 percent of its volume from soft drinks and only 7 percent from its @entity250 bottled water			1
it 's why @entity80 , which holds 13 percent of the bottled water market compared with @entity81 's 10 percent , does n't seem to think bottled water will ever overtake soda			1
in an emailed statement , the @entity255 - based company noted that soft drinks remain a far larger category than bottled water and that it sees ' upside ' for sodas over the next several years			1
however , the company added that it saw ' great potential ' for bottled water			2
like its competitors , @entity80 said it 's focusing on growing its portfolio of bottled waters profitably by offering brands such as @entity269 and its flavored vitaminwater , which fetch higher prices			0
in the meantime , the chairman and former ceo of @entity274 , @entity275 , is waiting for bottled water 's moment in the spotlight			2
@entity274 , the @entity280 company that makes @entity281 , @entity282 , @entity283 and other brands , has nearly half of the share of the bottled water market			2
at a beverage industry conference late last year , @entity275 noted that bottled water is ' the elephant in the room			2
' and given the growing warnings over drinking too many calories — including from juice , milk and other sugary drinks — @entity275 said he 's confident that water will continue to grow in popularity			0
' for thousands of years , water was beverage of choice for human beings , ' he said			0
' now we 're reverting back to that			0

bottled water has led that growth , with consumption nearly doubling to 21 gallons a year
consumption of soft drinks went down as more and more doctors blamed the sugary beverages for @entity3 obesity
