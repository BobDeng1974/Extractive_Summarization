many of us would run a mile rather than listen to the travel recommendations of friends who have just returned from an exotic part of the world complete with sun tans , very long anecdotes and overly effusive comments about how ‘ you really should go yourselves			2
’ but if we were all to base our future holiday arrangements on the advice of others , it seems that – according to a new study – we would all be packing our bags for @entity16			0
@entity17 : @entity16 has two coastlines - and proffers beauties such as @entity20 , on its @entity22 side with scenery like the @entity24 , @entity16 is the destination travellers would most recommend and we would definitely not be going to @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 or @entity29			1
new research conducted by the @entity31 asked a total of 23,000 holidaymakers , in 26 different countries around the world , to name the destination that they would most recommend to others based on their own travel experiences			0
those questioned as part of the survey were restricted to countries they had visited in the previous 12 months , and asked whether they would or would n’t tell others to follow suit			2
the number of people who criticised a recent holiday destination was then subtracted from the number praising a place as visit - worthy , to produce a net score for each country			2
and the @entity55 came top of the tree with a score of 63 – finishing a clear five points ahead of @entity60 and @entity61 ( both 58 ) , @entity62 ( 57 ) and @entity63 ( 56 )			1
not too shabby : @entity67 , with the sights of @entity65 to the fore , came a respectable tenth in the survey although not , perhaps , well known to @entity67 holidaymakers , @entity16 ’s appeal is easy to fathom			1
it is one of only seven countries able to boast coastlines on both the @entity22 and the @entity76 ( the others are @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 ) , and as such , is home to a wealth of wonderful beaches			0
@entity67 performed relatively well in the survey , polling a score of 52 , finishing in joint tenth position along with @entity90 and @entity91			1
other countries fared less well in this court of popular opinion			0
@entity95 was the only country in the survey to ‘ achieve ’ the dubious feat of a negative score , polling a dreadful -7			0
@entity105 = @entity104 = @entity103 = croatia7 = @entity102			0
@entity106 = @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity67 64			1
@entity95 and the @entity116 also fell foul of plenty of tourists			0
although it can boast the sunshine island of @entity121 , and some of the world ’s most pristine areas of rainforest , @entity26 finished second bottom of the pile with a score of just four			1
perhaps surprisingly , @entity27 – home to the exciting cities of @entity129 and @entity130 , plus the historic wonder of the @entity132 – came third last , polling a meagre five			2
and @entity133 contributed to a miserable survey for the @entity116 , slumping to fourth bottom with an unimpressive recommendation rating of six			1
@entity137 also found itself on the receiving end of traveller discontent			0
@entity140 was the fourth of over 70 states included in the survey to manage a rating of less than ten , with a score of only eight – a vote of no - confidence from holidaymakers which will not , perhaps , come as the biggest shock in light of the current troubles in the country			0
but @entity29 ( 18 points ) , @entity28 ( 20 ) and @entity154 ( 21 ) will wonder who they offended			0
‘ this study is one of the most broadly based assessments of recent tourism experiences and future intentions , ’ says @entity157 , on behalf of the @entity31			0
‘ it looks at destination appeal and the likelihood of recommending a country based solely on personal experience in the last 12 months			0
’ beautiful , but at the bottom : despite the allure of @entity121 , @entity26 did not fare well as a recommended destination the results , mr @entity157 says , make happy reading for @entity67			1
‘ it ’s a credit to the @entity67 that it has achieved a high joint tenth position in a league table.of more than 70 countries , especially given the competition of countries with more favourable climates , ’ he continues			1
‘ overseas visits rose to 32.8million in 2013 , up 5.6 per cent on 2012 , and the prominence of the @entity67 is good news for our tourism sector and the overall economy			2
’ half of the 26 countries consulted as part of the survey were in @entity137 ( @entity191 , @entity192 , @entity193 , @entity194 , @entity195 , @entity91 , @entity196 , @entity63 , @entity197 , @entity198 , @entity28 , @entity67 and @entity140 )			1
eight @entity200 countries ( @entity201 , @entity27 , @entity26 , @entity202 , the @entity203 , @entity204 , @entity205 and @entity206 ) were also involved , with four countries in the @entity208 ( @entity102 , @entity90 , @entity83 and @entity209 ) , plus @entity210 , rounding out the line - up .			1

@entity60 also ranks highly as a place travellers would commend to friends
@entity67 fares relatively well in the survey , coming joint tenth with @entity91
@entity26 , @entity27 and @entity133 comprise surprise bottom three in results
