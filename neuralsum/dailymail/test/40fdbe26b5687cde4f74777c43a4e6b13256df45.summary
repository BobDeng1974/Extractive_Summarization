a family have spoken of their heartbreak after two of their beloved pet dogs were shot dead by their neighbour			1
the horrific incident happened after @entity8 and @entity9 moved with their five children to the rural village of @entity13 in @entity14 in 2005			1
they thought their big house with a large garden surrounded by arable land would be a peaceful and idyllic family home			1
but their happiness was shattered in 2014 after their dogs @entity25 and @entity26 were shot after escaping on to their neighbour 's farmland where they were accused of killing his birds			1
@entity36 , left , is the family 's remaining dog @entity8 reveals on @entity48 show @entity49 how she had a long - running dispute with the owner of the farm , @entity53 , over her dogs trespassing on his property			1
it began with their first dog - a @entity59 called @entity60 - who the family got shortly after moving into their new home			2
@entity8 said @entity60 kept escaping from their garden onto mr @entity53 's land causing him to come and complain			1
she explained : ' he knocked on the door and said " your dog is getting out , she 's being a problem , she 's going after my pheasants "			2
' ' i did n't like him , i thought he was rude			0
i was upset as i did n't want to cause trouble			0
we did our best to make sure it would n't happen again and i thought that would be the end of it			0
' but a few days later , mr @entity53 returned to complain that @entity60 had killed 120 of his birds and if he saw her on his land again , he would shoot her			0
@entity9 said he found this hard to believe as @entity60 did not show any evidence of having attacked the birds as she never had blood on her fur or around her mouth			1
@entity8 outside her home in @entity13 , @entity14			1
she thought it would be the perfect place to raise her family but now wants to move following the devastating loss of their two family pets @entity8 added : ' she was gentle			1
i found it so hard to believe what he was saying was true			0
i said i wanted proof of dead pheasants before i gave him any money but we did n't hear from him again			0
' terrified that @entity60 's life was at risk if she escaped from their garden again , @entity8 and @entity9 made the painful decision to have her re-homed			1
' @entity60 's safety came first so we have to give her away , it tore me apart for three or four months , ' @entity8 said			1
her young son @entity116 added he was also upset they had to give her away			0
' @entity60 was a really gentle dog , i loved her but she kept escaping			2
i was devastated , heartbroken , i had her for a long time , ' he said			0
the family decided to keep one of @entity60 's puppies , @entity25 , and hoped she would not have her mother 's adventurous tendency to roam outside their garden			2
for years , they did n't have any trouble with mr @entity53 so they decided to get two more dogs , @entity26 and @entity36 in 2013			2
but the three dogs started following in @entity60 's footsteps and repeatedly escaped onto mr @entity53 's land			2
the @entity9 's first dog @entity60 , pictured , had to be re-homed because she kept escaping from their garden @entity116 said they tried to put up more fences and block holes to stop the dogs leaving their garden ' but they kept digging under the hedge and getting out			1
' however , as they had no further complaints from their neighbours , @entity8 did n't think too much of it			1
in august 2014 , they arranged to go away for a family holiday leaving her mother and sister to look after the three dogs			1
three days into their trip , they received some shocking news			0
' my mum called and said the farmer had complained that @entity26 and @entity25 had been on his land , ' @entity8 recalled			1
' it was a shock as i had n't had any runs in with him since @entity60			0
' she said they had both been shot , they 're dead			0
it was like a dream , i was devastated			0
' mr @entity53 said the dogs had broken into one of his pens and slaughtered his birds			2
this gave his gamekeeper the right to shot them under the @entity173			2
owners whose dogs are killed can prosecute on the grounds that their property has been destroyed			0
@entity8 reveals how they tried to patch up holes in their garden walls and fences to stop the dogs getting out but they kept digging holes to escape @entity25 , pictured , was killed for worrying livestock after the farmer 's gamekeeper acted within the law when the dogs were said to break into a bird pen on farmer @entity53 's property but if the killer has a ' lawful excuse ' - such as where there were no other means of ending or preventing the dogs worrying their livestock - they have not committed an offence			1
mr @entity53 says he and his gamekeeper acted with the law and they have not been charged with any wrong - doing			1
it 's a bitter pill for the @entity202 to swallow as they say they are bereft at the loss of their two pets			1
@entity116 said when he heard the dogs had been killed he felt like ' a chunk of me was gone , it was like my heart was pulled away			0
' meanwhile , @entity8 , who still has one dog , @entity36 , says she is also struggling to come to terms with what happened and no longer wants to live in the area			2
she said : ' i 'm on anti-depressants			0
i do n't want to live here anymore			0
everywhere there are reminders of what he 's done and what he 's taken away from us			0
' the @entity49 is on @entity48 wednesdays at 8pm			0

@entity8 and @entity9 moved with children to idyllic @entity227 , @entity14
their dogs kept escaping onto neighbouring farmland
they were *warned* if dogs kept bothering farmer 's birds , they *'d* be shot
*couple* believed dogs were gentle and would n't have attacked birds
in 2014 while family were on holiday , gamekeeper shot two of the dogs
acted within law so was not charged
family are devastated by loss of pets and now want to move
