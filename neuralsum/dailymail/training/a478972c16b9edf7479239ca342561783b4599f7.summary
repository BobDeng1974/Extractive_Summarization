' to date , we are hearing very few reports of actual fraud , but are closely monitoring the situation , ' she said			0
she said the stolen information was limited to data stored on the magnetic strip			2

the @entity157 reports that when he opened the glove compartment to get his registration papers , police saw that it was also holding a loaded 32 - caliber handgun			0

that software is installed on 40,000 machines across the 1,797 stores in the @entity34 all the card details were then sent back to the hackers through the internet over the course of three weeks before the theft was discovered			2
the software could have spread through the @entity4 network after being installed on a company machine , possibly by fooling an employee into clicking on a fake link in a ' phishing ' scam			0
