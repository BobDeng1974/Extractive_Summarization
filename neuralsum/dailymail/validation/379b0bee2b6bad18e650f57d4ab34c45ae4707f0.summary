the head of the @entity2 army has admitted that he is ‘ very concerned ’ about cuts to @entity5 ’s defence spending			1
general @entity6 warned that the cuts could diminish @entity5 ’s ability to fight future campaigns			1
he also called on the government to maintain defence spending at the @entity13 target of two per cent of national income			1
i would be lying to you if i did not say that i am very concerned about the gdp investment in the @entity5 , ’ he told @entity24			2
‘ we have a bilateral agreement between our two countries to work together			0
it is about having a partner that has very close values and the same goals as we do			0
‘ what has changed , though , is the level of capability			0
in the past we would have a @entity37 division working alongside an @entity2 army division			0
now it might be a @entity5 brigade inside an @entity2 division			0
’ his warning came after the former head of the @entity37 said yesterday that fresh cuts to @entity5 ’s @entity46 would be ‘ unwise ’ with the @entity47 facing twin dangers of a new @entity49 with @entity50 and the rise of @entity53 extremism			2
sir @entity54 ( left ) and former defence secretary ( right ) are among those to have spoken out against the chancellor 's plan to reduce military spending to below the @entity13 benchmark of 2 per cent of gdp in his first interview since retiring last september , general sir @entity54 admitted that he doubted @entity5 politicians had the will to ‘ tackle the really wicked issues ’ facing the world			1
and the ex-chief of the general staff urged all the major political parties to promise to protect defence spending at 2 per cent of national income after the general election			1
he said a fall in funding would lead to cuts in budgets for training , equipment and even military missions – further undermining the @entity5 ’s global standing			1
the prime minister has faced criticism over the cuts which , say experts , would ' comfort enemies ' speaking to @entity86 's @entity87 , sir @entity54 urged : ' we military folk would like to see manifesto commitments to levels of defence expenditure and it 's of concern to us that all parties would probably be content to have this conversation not happening at the moment			1
' implicit in what the current government was saying around the time of the @entity13 summit in @entity102 last year where we were suggesting that it was everybody 's responsibility around @entity106 to meet the 2 % of gdp for defence expenditure , implicit in that is the fact that that 's what we ought to be doing ourselves			1
' his views were echoed by former defence secretary @entity112 who suggested foreign aid be redirected in order to increase funds			1
' to say that we were willing to guarantee a proportion of gdp for international aid but not willing to implement our commitments in terms of defence , i think a lot of conservatives would find that very difficult to swallow especially at a time when you can see the international security environment is deteriorating , ' he told the @entity86 's @entity128			0
' what is happening at the moment with , for example , @entity129 , is really only one miscalculation away from creating an article 5 crisis that brings conflict to the @entity106 continent			0
' he was referring to the @entity13 article which considers an attack on one of its members an attack on all 28			0
dr @entity112 added the relationship between @entity5 and @entity2 had been compromised following @entity146 's voting against intervening in @entity147 following the regime 's reported use of chemical weapons			1
' i think there was damage done to @entity5 's relationship with the @entity2 at least to an extent when @entity146 voted not to take action over the @entity147 use of chemical weapons			2
during a recent visit to @entity160 mr @entity159 was told by president @entity161 that reducing @entity5 's defence budget to below 2 per cent would undermine the treaty ' i think there 's a real danger here which is ( that ) you should n't make threats which you 're not willing to follow through on			1
' if you draw red lines , as president @entity161 did , and do n't follow them through , that only gives comfort to your enemies			0
' @entity159 was among world leaders who pressed other member countries into meeting the 2 per cent target of military spending at the summit in @entity102 last year			2
however recent reports revealed the government planned to lower spending to 1.8 per cent			2
president @entity161 last month insisted @entity5 live up to the agreed amount or it would face weakening @entity13			2
during a visit to @entity160 he told @entity159 that anything less than 2 per cent would seek to undermine the treaty			0
only four countries are thought to have met the quota in the past			0
they are the @entity2 , @entity5 , @entity190 and @entity191 .			0

general @entity6 has admitted he is ' very concerned ' about cuts
warned it will diminish @entity5 's ability to fight future campaigns *overseas*
former head of @entity5 army also warned against plans to cut budget
sir @entity54 described the world as ' *uncertain* ' amid the threat of @entity206
his criticisms were echoed by former defence secretary dr @entity112
dr @entity112 said backing down on military promises ' gave comfort to enemies '
a report revealed @entity216 would reduce spending to 1.8 per cent
this would fall below the 2 per cent benchmark set by @entity13 members
