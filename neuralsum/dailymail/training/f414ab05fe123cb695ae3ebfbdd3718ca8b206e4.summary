in this age of instant news perhaps the only two groups of people who still wait eagerly for the postman to arrive are star - crossed lovers on @entity7 and professional golfers eagerly awaiting their official invitation to the masters			1
for rising @entity12 @entity11 , the joyous confirmation of the latter came recently while halfway through a gym session at home			1
‘ i saw the postman coming down the yard , so i stopped the gym session and ran to the door because i had an inkling it was going to be the day , ’ said the 27 - year - old from @entity18			1
‘ obviously i knew i ’d made it to @entity25 by what i ’d done at the end of last year but there ’s still nothing like holding the official invitation			1
it just feels awesome to be setting out on a new season knowing you can plan your early year schedule around a trip to @entity25			1
’ @entity11 with his trophy after winning the prestigious @entity37 in @entity38 in december @entity11 is sprayed with @entity39 after his victory in @entity38 earned him a place in the masters @entity11 booked his place with a victory in the prestigious @entity37 in @entity38 in december that in turn got him into the all - important world top 50			1
he was the underdog going into the final round against a former world no 1 in @entity50 but underlined his potential by outplaying his countryman with a nerveless display			1
now , the hope is that after a few frustrating years when he has clearly been held back by a nagging back injury , he can lead the next wave of talented @entity12 golfers to the upper echelons of the game			1
‘ that ’s certainly the goal , ’ said @entity11			2
‘ i ’ve obviously gained a lot of confidence from what happened at the @entity37			1
to play pretty flawless golf for the last 36 holes on a tight course was very satisfying			2
@entity12 @entity11 plays a shot during the final round of the @entity71 championship ‘ we seem to have a good new wave of @entity12 golfers and it ’s funny how it seems to happen in cycles			2
you ’ve got the likes of @entity50 and @entity80 ( @entity81 ) , @entity82 and @entity83 , who were all about the same age and now you ’ve got the likes of myself and @entity89 ( @entity90 ) , @entity88 [ @entity87 ] and a few others			2
so hopefully i can be the leader			2
we ’re all aiming high and let ’s hope we can go on to match the last wave			0
’ @entity11 ’s father is a @entity96 vicar and he could be forgiven for being rather sick of the fact that every piece about him points out that he is the son of a preacher man			0
‘ no , i ’m not fed up of it			0
he ’s retiring in a couple of years anyway so you ’ll all have to stop it then , ’ said @entity11 , with a grin			0
@entity11 has been in fine form recently and has earned a place at the first major of the season , the masters rather than his dad , it was his two older brothers , who were both sports - mad , who got @entity11 into golf			1
‘ i had to find some sport that i could beat them in , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s funny when golf gets its hooks into you			0
i would practice for hours on my own			0
it takes over your childhood			0
’ @entity11 goes into the @entity122 this week as leader of the race to @entity125 , and hoping his status will get him invitations to regular @entity129 events ahead of the masters			1
‘ it might mean a last - minute dash to tournaments but that ’s not a bad problem to have , ’ he said			0
‘ @entity18 or @entity136 in february			0
that ’s a toughie , is n’t it ? ’ in @entity125 last year , @entity11 fulfilled a long - held dream to do a bit of sky - diving			0
now , having recently got married and with a prized @entity143 invitation on the mantelpiece , he is looking up .			0
