by @entity0 published : 19:18 est , 20 october 2013 updated : 02:47 est , 21 october 2013 under attack : @entity3 's 72 - hour u-turn has drawn criticism from both his conservative colleagues and his own party @entity3 is under attack from the @entity8 and even his own party after performing a 72 - hour u-turn on the government ’s flagship education policy			1
the deputy prime minister was accused by one @entity11 source of attempting to cling on to ‘ chauffeurs and people greasing up to him ’ by pandering to @entity17 in the hope of keeping his job in a @entity21 after 2015			1
in the strongest condemnation of mr @entity3 since the coalition was formed , the source said his name had ‘ become a byword for cheap sanctimony , opportunism , gimmicks and lying ’			1
@entity30 , the former @entity31 minister , insisted the free schools programme now being criticised by mr @entity3 was ‘ liberal with a small “ l ” ’ and should be supported			1
mr @entity3 yesterday broke ranks with the @entity34 , declaring he will no longer support the fundamental principles of free schools , which have been set up by businesses , charities , religious organisations and groups of parents free from state control			2
he said he disagreed with several of the most important freedoms exercised by free school heads , including their power to set their own curriculum and hire teachers without union - recognised qualifications			0
incredibly , his remarks came days after @entity31 education minister @entity51 enthusiastically praised the scheme , which has been largely opposed by @entity17 , in the @entity53			1
last thursday , mr @entity51 suggested the freedom to hire who they wanted had allowed free schools to take on ‘ superb ’ staff			0
but mr @entity3 suggested that the @entity31 manifesto for the 2015 election will include a ‘ parental guarantee ’ that children in all schools are taught by qualified teachers , follow the national curriculum , and receive high - standard school meals			1
mr @entity3 said that the @entity8 are failing to apply the ‘ minimum amount of basic standards ’ to free schools by allowing them to employ whoever they want			1
he is expected to expand on the remarks in a speech on thursday in which he will criticise the @entity8 ‘ ideology ’ which he says means free schools and academies have too much freedom			1
the deputy prime minister admitted that his words on free schools contradict current government policies , but claimed the difference was not damaging			1
‘ it ’s an open , grown - up difference			0
it ’s not a crisis , ’ he said			0
one @entity11 source said : ‘ it 's no surprise that @entity3 - a man whose name is a byword for cheap sanctimony , opportunism , gimmicks and lying - wants to grab back power for mps to meddle in schools			1
‘ @entity95 has pushed through academies to embed state schools ' independence from the meddling of mps like @entity3 - so he will never accept @entity3 's latest stunt as a serious policy			1
' all @entity3 ever cares about in meetings is politics - never policy			2
he loves the chauffeurs and people greasing up to him and he will try anything to cling onto a cushy job if @entity110 wins			0
but whenever he promises anything , people should just think - how much was his cast iron promise on tuition fees worth ? ' conservative planning minister @entity115 , meanwhile , suggested mr @entity3 was a hypocrite because he did not want state schools to have the same freedoms enjoyed by his expensive private alma mater , @entity119			2
‘ @entity3 thinks that the freedoms enjoyed by his old school are too good for free schools			2
do n't look to @entity124 to defend your freedoms , folks , ’ he said			0
mr @entity115 added that mr @entity3 , who sacked mr @entity30 earlier this month to the dismay of those on the @entity130 of his party , said the deputy prime minister was ‘ rejecting true liberals ’			1
mr @entity30 , appearing on the @entity136 ’s @entity135 programme , suggested that mr @entity3 was trying to distance the @entity124 from some parts of the coalition agenda in order to appeal to left - leaning voters and party activists			2
‘ i support free schools			0
free schools is a small ‘ l ’ liberal policy			2
i do n’t want us to feel that we have to echo the policy positions of the @entity17 left … and crave the approval of columnists like @entity150 [ of the @entity151 ]			2
‘ i do n’t want us to be a pale imitation of the @entity17 , i think we should be a proud and unambiguously liberal party			1
‘ if we look like a party that is uneasy and ambivalent about our role in government , people wo n’t give us credit for the successes of the government and we wo n’t be able to claim the authorship that we should be able to claim for our policy successes in government			1
’ out of step : @entity3 's outburst comes just a couple of days after @entity31 education minister @entity51 praised the scheme in the commons last thursday @entity168 , headmaster of the independent @entity169 , said : ‘ i strongly believe that teachers are born not made and i will actively seek out teachers from all walks of life who have the potential to inspire children			1
‘ we have 39 teachers without formal teaching qualifications , including me			0
some have come straight from university : our history and politics department has three recent graduates , all with firsts from @entity187 or @entity188 and all excellent teachers			0
others have come from other careers : an investment analyst , a lawyer , a management consultant , a nuclear physicist and someone from the @entity136			0
’ @entity196 appointed a professional actor as a drama teacher , and a professional singer for music , while @entity201 has appointed the former head of classics at a renowned independent school , as its classics teacher			0
they have also appointed an artist with several degrees as an art teacher			0
education minister @entity210 said it was a ‘ shame ’ some @entity124 did not back free schools and suggested mr @entity3 was pretending to be opposed to elements of the programme to appease left - wing activists			1
she said the ‘ whole point ’ of the schools was ‘ that hey have these freedoms ... that 's what 's helping them outperform maintained schools ’			2
‘ you should n't kill of the goose that 's laid the golden egg , ’ she added			2
@entity225 , @entity17 's @entity226 , said : ‘ @entity95 and @entity228 's divisive free schools programme is unravelling for all to see			1
but @entity3 is locked in to this failure too			0
it is his policies that have led to the mess we saw at the @entity236 free school earlier , the looming crisis in teacher recruitment and the 141 per cent rise in unqualified teachers since 2010			0
‘ what is clear is that @entity17 's policies of ensuring that all teachers should be qualified and that schools are subject to proper local oversight are the right ones for educating our children			1
’ a @entity250 spokesman said : ‘ free schools are raising standards and giving parents more choice			0
they are run by teachers – not local bureaucrats or @entity119 politicians – and are free to set their own curriculum , decide how they spend their money and employ who they think are the best people for the job			0
this government is not going to take these freedoms away			0
‘ independent schools have always been able to hire brilliant people who have not got qualified teacher status			0
free schools and academies now have the same freedoms as independent schools to hire great linguists , computer scientists , engineers and other specialists so they can inspire their pupils			0
