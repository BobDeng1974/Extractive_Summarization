@entity0 has told fellow @entity2 leaders not to pay ransoms for hostages as it only increases kidnappings and funds further terrorism			1
the prime minister used the military alliance 's two - day summit in @entity12 to hit out at countries who hand over multi-million pound sums to @entity17 jihadis			1
his warning came as a @entity20 translator for the charity employing @entity23 hostage @entity24 described the moment when @entity27 fighters sprang from two cars to kidnap the @entity29 last year			1
while the @entity58 has always said it will not pay ransoms for @entity23 nationals , hostages from other countries - such as @entity42 and @entity43 - have been released after large sums were reportedly paid out			1
speaking ahead of the dinner , mr @entity0 described such payments as ' deeply regrettable ' and warned : ' it is utterly self - defeating			1
it is worse than self - defeating , it is actually a risk to us back at home			2
' all those people who signed these declarations know that what matters is not your signature on a declaration but not letting money be paid to terrorist kidnappers because that money goes into arms , it goes into weapons , it goes into terror plots , it goes into more kidnaps			2
' his comments came as an eyewitness told how @entity23 aid worker @entity24 - and @entity43 colleague @entity89 , who was released in may - were kidnapped by ' professional ' gunmen who targeted his vehicle to take @entity93 hostages			1
the unnamed translator said his group were driving back to @entity96 via @entity97 from the nearby @entity99 refugee camp when the gunmen appeared			2
@entity2 leaders gathered in @entity51 as the @entity102 faces increased threats from @entity17 militants in the @entity105 the man told the @entity107 : ' two very fast cars came up behind â€“ one overtook and the other stayed behind			1
they shouted at us to get out of the car in formal @entity113			0
they were wearing black masks and were so professional			0
' they knew that two of us were @entity20 and they knew who else was in the car			0
one of them put a gun to my head and threatened me not to tell anyone what i had seen			0
' they put [ mr @entity24 and mr @entity89 ] in the boot of their car and shot out the tyres of our car			1
' the translator said the kidnapping took place ' in seconds ' and the gunmen included at least one foreigner who appeared to be of @entity140 origin			0
aid worker @entity24 , pictured with his second child , who is now four , is being held by @entity27 militants , who have already killed two @entity145 journalists he added : ' no - one thought that would happen so close to the border			1
all of us were just looking forward to getting back to @entity96			0
' the translator praised mr @entity24 for his warmth and humanity towards the @entity20 refugees			2
he said : ' i remember he was really worried for the people [ in one camp ] because they did n't have toilets			0
he stopped by every child though and made a joke with them			0
' he was always smiling and listening to the refugees			0
those three days , i was with the best guy in aid work			0
' the prime minister is to personally brief a member of the @entity24 family on the latest developments in a case that has caused outrage around the world			2
on tuesday , the 44 - year - old @entity29 was shown kneeling in the sand wearing an orange jumpsuit on a video of the beheading of a @entity145 hostage			1
military commanders have been asked to draw up plans for a special forces rescue			0
the prime minister , who is coming under growing pressure to unleash a military response , said @entity23 would use ' everything we have in our armoury ' to squeeze the terror group out of existence , and repeatedly refused to rule out joining the @entity145 in air strikes - even leaving the door open to attacking @entity27 in @entity20 without the approval of president @entity189			1
but he appeared to indicate that such action was not imminent , stressing that his immediate priority was offering support to legitimate regional forces already confronting @entity27 on the ground , such as the @entity196 government in @entity197 and the @entity199 authorities in the north of the country			2
' i think sometimes people think that there is no strategy unless it simply consists of air strikes , ' said mr @entity0			2
' that is not the case			0
what it needs is a fully - formed strategy to squeeze this from every angle			0
that is what you are getting from this conference			0
' government sources said that , in a one - to - one meeting with @entity145 president @entity220 , the two leaders discussed ' broad strategy ' for dealing with the terrorist threat , rather than specific action			1
mr @entity0 said ministers were now ' actively ' considering whether to supply arms to the @entity199 peshmerga militias fighting @entity27 in northern @entity196 or to provide them with military training			1
a witness to the kidnapping of mr @entity24 - pictured with his younger daugther - has told how ' professional ' gunmen seized him in northern @entity20 last year mr @entity24 is now being held by @entity27 militants , who released a film of him on his knees in an orange boiler suit earlier this week lieutenant general sir @entity236 , the government 's senior defence adviser in the @entity105 , has been in discussions with leaders of the @entity199 administration in @entity241 about how best the @entity23 could assist			1
so far @entity23 has supplied only non-lethal equipment - such as helmets and body armour - although @entity246 transport planes have flown in ammunition supplied from @entity248 for the @entity251 ' @entity250 - era weaponry			2
leader of the @entity253 has told mps that ministers will seek @entity257 's support for any @entity23 air strikes against @entity36 extremists if ' there is time to do so ' , though he added that the government is not proposing military action ' at the moment '			1
asked whether the @entity23 could join with the @entity145 in air strikes , mr @entity0 told @entity266 's @entity265 ( @entity267 ) : ' i 'm certainly not ruling anything out and i will always act in the @entity23 national interest			1
' he added : ' we need to show real resolve and determination , we need to use every power and everything in our armoury with our allies , with those on the ground , to make sure we do everything we can to squeeze this dreadful organisation out of existence			0
' he also stressed the urgent need for the establishment of an inclusive and stable government in @entity197 , which @entity196 prime minister - designate @entity286 has said he hopes to form by around september 11 .			0
