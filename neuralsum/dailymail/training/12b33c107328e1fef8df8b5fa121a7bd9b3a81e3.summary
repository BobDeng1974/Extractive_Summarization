from dinosaurs to dolphins and birds , one artist has been inspired by nature to create incredible images of concept airplanes			1
@entity7 set out to create aircraft that look streamlined , futuristic and beautiful , but experts are not convinced that machines based on the designs would ever be able to fly			1
the ‘ 100 per cent whimsical ’ drawings are also influenced by popular sci - fi films as mr @entity7 , 31 , from @entity14 , wanted to draw ' instantly recognisable craft ’ as iconic as @entity17 ’s @entity16			1
@entity7 set out to create machines that look streamlined , futuristic and beautiful , but experts are not convinced that machines based on the designs would ever be able to fly			1
this concept is based on a swan while he has no background in aircraft design , mr @entity7 has drawn jets for films and computer games that look like they could soar though the skies on other planets and in future times			1
‘ they look like they might fly but are strange and silly , ’ he told @entity32			1
among the creatures which mr @entity7 has based his designs upon , are : warthogs , zebras and woodlice , marine creatures like manta rays , dolphins and jellyfish , birds such as swifts and swallows as well as the pterodactyl , a new extinct ancient flying reptile			1
while he has no background in aircraft design , mr @entity7 has drawn jets for films and computer games that look like they could soar though the skies on other planets and in future times			2
this fighter jet looks a lot like a manta ray the ' 100 per cent whimsical ' drawings like this plane with flexible wings , based on the shape of a swift , are also influenced by popular sci - fi films as mr @entity7 , from @entity61 , wanted to draw instantly recognisable craft ¿ as iconic as @entity17 's @entity16 artist @entity7 said that he is fascinated by dinosaurs and this terrifying war machine is inspired by pterodactyl , as well as his favourite films such as @entity67 and @entity68 he set out to draw machines that also act as ‘ characters ’ because of their animalistic qualities and hopes one day to design futuristic transport full - time for films and games			1
‘ i wanted them to look instantly recognisable and to make them look kind of friendly ’ despite the fact that many war planes are built to kill people			2
he admits that he has never grown out of dinosaurs and is ‘ stealing from the best ’ that nature has to offer			0
they might look like classic visions of @entity85 , but these innovative aircraft concepts were inspired by jellyfish			0
however , an engineer told @entity32 that they would need a new propulsion system that has not been invented yet to fly the mechanical - looking monster is based on a warthog and was imagined over a physical model built by @entity93 , who made the knives for @entity97 's @entity96 film and mr @entity7 has worked with to illustrate ideas from his sci - fi books this futuristic mode of transport came about beacuse of mr @entity7 's attempts to draw a kind of zebra			1
it would be driven by a human inside the machine 's stripy body ‘ you ca n’t come away from watching a @entity111 documentary without thinking about how beautiful and interesting nature is			0
and i ’d love cars and planes to be beautiful and sculptural – a little like yachts are			0
not just about the function of sailing			0
’ he said that @entity93 particularly inspires him because of his work for film director @entity97 , models of sci - fi vehicles and writing as well as films such as @entity124 and author @entity125			1
mr @entity7 creates his amazing drawings by first making 3d models using computer software called @entity129 he then draws on top of them in @entity132 and said that while the technique allows him great accuracy in his work , there are also ‘ happy accidents of the pen ’ that gives his work impact and lets them flow			2
these fighter jets with distinctive curved wings are inspired by seagulls			0
' they look like they might fly but are strange and silly , ' mr @entity7 told @entity32 a strange vision of the future ? ' the vehicle in the foreground is something along the lines of a scarab or woodlouse			1
the plane is rather like a manta ray , ' mr @entity7 said this design shows the wings of an imaginary aircraft flexing			0
' i think from this angle it looks more like a porpoise or dolphin , ' mr @entity7 said while some of the futuristic aircraft concepts certainly look like they can fly , professor @entity163 , of @entity164 who is an expert in aerospace engineering and a fellow of the @entity167 , is doubtful that the ideas would create a real flying machine			1
‘ birds and dinosaurs are nature ’s ultimate evolved flying machines , ’ he told @entity32 he said that mr @entity7 ’s art is fanciful and creative , but would probably not make for efficient aircraft built upon engineering knowledge			1
while some of the futuristic aircraft concepts certainly look like they can fly , professor @entity163 , of @entity164 who is an expert in aerospace engineering and a fellow of the @entity167 , is doubtful that the ideas would create a real flying machine			2
this rather convincing - looking fighter jet was inspired by a dragon and a chicken and look like it has jaws these sleek looking concpet aircraft were based on a bird called the storm petrel			0
however , an engineering expert said : ' birds and dinosaurs do n't have jet engines or propellers to accommodate and their propulsion is limited by bone and muscle - meaning that they have to flap - which is not very efficient at all ' mr @entity7 revealed that this curvy aircraft is based on a stylised painting of a swan on wall of the @entity205 pub in @entity14 , showing that inspiration really is everywhere ‘ birds and dinosaurs do n’t have jet engines or propellers to accommodate and their propulsion is limited by bone and muscle – meaning that they have to flap – which is not very efficient at all			1
’ professor @entity163 explained that if you design an aircraft around a bird , the best thing you could come up with is a copy of a bird			0
‘ if you design one around a jet or propeller you get something appropriate to the power those technologies generate and probably a large wing span for efficiency as well as a blended wing and fuselage ( the aircraft ’s body that holds the crew , passengers or cargo )			0
aeronautics expert professor @entity163 said that some of the designs look as if they do have wings that integrate seamlessly the body of the aircraft , which could help them to fly			0
a line of forbidding fighter jets are lined up for imaginary action here , but were inspired by chickens this futuristic aircraft looks at first glance like a marine monster , but was inspired by a small starling he did concede that some of the designs look as if they do have wings and the body of the aircraft , which could help them to fly , but the circular design inspired by a jellyfish , which also looks like many popular visions of @entity85 , is ‘ out of the question ’ in terms of engineering			2
‘ it would be really inefficient and you would need a different kind of propulsion system [ than currently used ] to make it fly , ’ professor @entity163 said			0
however , he said that @entity268 ’s prototype @entity263 craft - which is a blended wing body concept and a cross between a conventional plane and flying wing design – does bear some resemblance to some of mr @entity7 ’s designs			2
an expert at the @entity272 ( @entity272 ) said : ' most [ of the drawings ] look pretty unlikely but there is a lot of academic research into bio-inspired designs of many things			0
there is a lot to be learnt from nature but it is a lot more complex that copying the shape			0
' this cockpit - like structure was inspired by ' how starfish puke out their insides to eat ' , which mr @entity7 finds fascinating but disgusting professor @entity163 explained that if you design an aircraft around a bird the best thing you could come up with is a copy of a bird			2
this drawing shows a line of planes inspired by swans			0

@entity7 set out to create aircraft that look streamlined , futuristic and beautiful , inspired by creatures including warthogs , swans , manta rays , zebras jellyfish and even a pterodactyl
the @entity61 - based artist is also influenced by sci - fi films such as @entity17 and wanted to draw instantly recognisable craft as iconic as the @entity16
he makes a 3d model of the concept craft from his imagination and then draws on top of them to create the artwork
while the conceptual craft look streamlined , one aerospace expert told @entity32 that most of the designs have little *prospect* of being able to fly without the invention of new propulsion systems
