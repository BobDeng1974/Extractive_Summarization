by @entity0 published : 05:01 est , 25 april 2013 updated : 05:57 est , 25 april 2013 the @entity1 will expand an £ 80billion scheme to increase the flow of cheap loans to households and businesses - and buy - to - let landlords are set to benefit			1
@entity8 was launched in august to offer cheaper credit to cash - strapped small and medium - sized enterprises ( @entity10 ) struggling to get funding in the wake of the financial crash			1
under @entity8 , every pound of additional net lending to @entity10 for the rest of this year will entitle banks to £ 10 of super-cheap @entity1 loans			2
pay it forward : the @entity1 will allow business that borrow money under the @entity22 to pass it on to property investors			0
the scheme has been criticised as a desperate attempt to prop up the economy by chancellor @entity27 now these @entity10 will be allowed to lend the money on to property investors			0
@entity30 , chief @entity31 economist at @entity32 , told the @entity33 that although the @entity1 's extension of the scheme was intended to boost lending to @entity10 , it would also bolster the struggling housing market			2
( these are the only lenders to receive @entity22 so far ) ' it could be a no - brainer , ' he said			0
' lend to a landlord ... and get 10 times that lending back as essentially free funding , then recycle some of that back out again on mortgages or @entity45 ( buy - to - let )			0
' however , the scheme has been criticised for pumping money primarily into cheaper mortgages for those who already have large equity stakes , rather than into better rates for business loans or for first - time buyers that are struggling to meet tougher lending criteria from banks			2
on tuesday chancellor @entity27 was forced to deny he was panicking over the economy as the threat of a triple - dip recession loomed after rumours about the scheme 's expansion emerged			1
however , it was today revealed that the @entity31 economy has avoided a triple - dip recession , growing by 0.3 per cent between january and march this year			1
the economy was left on the brink of a triple dip recession , after output shrank by 0.3 per cent in the final quarter of 2012			1
the better - than - expected figure means that the economy returned to growth this year , following a contraction in the final quarter of 2012 , meaning the @entity31 narrowly avoided its third recession since 2008			1
chancellor @entity27 said : ‘ today 's figures are an encouraging sign the economy is healing			0
despite a tough economic backdrop , we are making progress			0
