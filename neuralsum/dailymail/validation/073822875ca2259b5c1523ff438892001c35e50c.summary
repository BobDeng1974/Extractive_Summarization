@entity1 captain @entity0 hopes sunday 's @entity3 final in @entity4 will be a ' big fairytale finish ' to the international career of @entity7			1
@entity7 has announced sunday 's match against either @entity9 or @entity10 will be the last of his international career			1
he will retire as @entity1 's most - capped test player - with 113 matches - and one - day internationals - sunday 's match will be his 291st for @entity1 and he needs three more dismissals sunday to finish with 300 odi wickets			2
@entity0 ( left ) celebrates with @entity7 after @entity1 reached the @entity3 final @entity7 made his debut aged 18 in 1997 and , now 36 , has spent half his life in the @entity1 team			1
while he says retirement ' is not what i 'm thinking about ' , his teammates want to help him end his career with a win			0
' he 's been an outstanding contributor for us , ' @entity0 said			2
' he 's played for @entity1 for half his life			0
' ( a win ) would be a great way to potentially send him off			0
' @entity7 is still a key member of the @entity1 team and has demonstrated his value throughout the @entity3 with a series of frugal bowling performances and cameo innings '			1
he was at the crease on 7 not out when @entity40 hit the winning runs in tuesday 's semi-final against @entity39			0
@entity7 was at the crease with @entity40 ( right ) as he hit the winning runs against @entity39 @entity7 ahead of his @entity44 in @entity45 as a 17 - year - old way back in 1997 ' i guess it was potentially his last game on home soil and for him to be out there at the end and be as instrumental and as calm as he was under pressure , it was superb , ' @entity0 said			1
' he was struggling a bit with his back , too			0
he 's played a lot of his career with bumps and bruises and niggles and strains			0
he 's a tough customer and he 's been an amazing servant			0
' but @entity7 does n't want his swansong to distract @entity1 from its aim of winning the @entity3 for the first time			1
' it 's not what i 'm thinking about , ' he said			0
' it 's just about having some fun and enjoying the game and enjoying the build - up to a @entity3 final , ' he said			1
' no - one else in @entity1 cricket history has been able to experience that before so it 's pretty exciting to experience a grand final week			2
' the chance to play a @entity3 final regardless of where you are in your career is something everyone dreams about			2
