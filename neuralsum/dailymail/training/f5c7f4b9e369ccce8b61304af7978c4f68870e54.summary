political scandal : @entity186 , left , with her husband - former @entity187 secretary @entity11			0
the murder case is one of @entity3 's biggest political scandals implicated : the official allegation against @entity10 suggests @entity4 might have been making threats against her son @entity57 , 24 @entity10 's sentencing could be a prelude to formal punishment of @entity11 , a brashly ambitious politician under investigation for alleged violations of party discipline - an accusation that covers corruption , abuse of power and other misdeeds			1
after the party leadership decides on those allegations , @entity11 could also face criminal charges related to the murder case			0
@entity11 's hopes for securing a spot in @entity3 's next top leadership unravelled after his former police chief , @entity212 , fled to a @entity214 consulate in early february for about 24 hours and exposed the murder allegations			1
@entity11 , the son of a revolutionary , ran the southwestern city of @entity218 where @entity4 was killed			0
@entity11 was seen as competing for a place in the @entity220 , the body at the pinnacle of power in @entity3 , at a once - in - a - decade leadership transition later this year			2
his downfall has stirred more division than that of any other leader for over two decades			0
to leftist supporters , @entity11 was a charismatic rallying figure for efforts to reimpose party control over dizzying , unequal market - led growth			0
but he made powerful enemies among those who saw him as an opportunist who wanted to impose his policies on the country			0
@entity11 was sacked as @entity218 boss in march and @entity10 was publicly accused of the murder in april , when @entity11 was suspended from the @entity220 , a 25 - member elite council that ranks below the @entity243			2
he has yet to be expelled from that council			0
four @entity3 policemen have also admitted to charges that they sought to protect @entity10 from investigation - a development that could also prove dangerous for @entity11			1
police sources in @entity218 have said @entity11 tried to shut down the investigation into his wife after being told she was a suspect			0
@entity11 has not been seen in public since march , when he gave a combative defence of his policies and family at a news conference during @entity3 's annual parliament session			1
the murder trial comes at a sensitive time in @entity3 with a handover soon of power to younger leaders			1
looking far plumper in the dock than before she was arrested , there was speculation yesterday that the world was watching @entity10 ’s ‘ body double ’ rather than the woman herself			2
micro-bloggers believe the government used a stand - in for @entity10 at the trial because her appearance has changed so radically since she has been in custody			2
she has put on weight , when most prisoners in @entity3 jails shed pounds			0
some are blaming her puffy appearance on the medication used to treat her ‘ mental state ’ , though few are convinced			0
controversy : looking far plumper in the dock , left , than before she was arrested , right , there was speculation yesterday that the world was watching @entity10 ’s ‘ body double ’ rather than the woman herself the @entity291 quoted two security experts ‘ familiar with facial recognition software ’ , who said the person shown in state television footage of the courtroom was not @entity10			0
if true , the real @entity10 could have done a deal with @entity187 chiefs and be spending her time under house arrest in far comfier surroundings than a jail			0
though it may seem far - fetched , the use of a body double by the rich and powerful in @entity3 is well documented by the media			2
in may 2009 , wealthy 20 - year - old @entity305 killed a pedestrian when drag - racing through the city streets of @entity308			0
in court , @entity305 is believed to have hired a body double to serve his three - year sentence			0
the same year , a hospital president who caused a deadly traffic accident hired an employee 's father to ‘ confess ’ and serve as his stand - in			0
in another case , after hitting and killing a motorcyclist , a man driving without a licence hired a substitute for £ 5,000			0
meanwhile , the owner of a demolition company that illegally demolished a home earlier this year hired a destitute man and promised him £ 20 for each day his ‘ body double ’ spent in jail			0
the practice is so common that there is even a term for it - ding zui			0
@entity333 means ‘ substitute ’ and zui means ‘ crime ’ , in other words , ‘ substitute criminal ’			0
video : @entity10 's reaction to the suspended death sentence aired on @entity3 state tv video : @entity10 escapes the death penalty for murdering @entity4 ...			1

@entity10 admitted lacing @entity5 businessman 's drink with cyanide
wife of high ranking @entity3 politician will probably spend 14 years in prison
poisoning *happened* after her lover ' threatened her playboy son '
media denied access to court to hear trial of ' @entity3 's @entity66 '
