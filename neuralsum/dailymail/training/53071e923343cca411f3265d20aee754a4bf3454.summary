the typical @entity1 family spends more than a quarter of its disposable income on childcare - almost three times as much as parents in other @entity8 countries			1
childcare costs swallow up 27 per cent of @entity1 parents ' net income on average , according to a @entity15 mp 's report which calls for a major overhaul of the system			1
in contrast , the average family in the @entity19 pays only 10 per cent of its net income to childminders			1
expensive : the typical @entity1 family spends more than a quarter of its disposable income on childcare			1
( pictured posed by models ) @entity29 mp @entity28 says that , despite the high costs , recent studies have shown widespread problems with quality , price and availability in the @entity1			1
in a report for the @entity38 think tank , she claims that while the number of nursery places has increased since 1996 , the number of childminder places has dropped drastically in the same period to 245,000 in 2010			0
the report argues that this has led to price inflation , while at the same time , becoming a childminder is now fraught with red tape			0
it calls for childminders to be allowed to take on more children at one time			1
speaking on @entity53 's today programme , miss @entity28 said a rule that @entity1 childminders can only look after three children at a time , including their own , was partly responsible for high costs			1
the ratio is one to four in @entity59 and one to five in @entity60 and the @entity19 , she added			1
arguing for change : @entity15 mp @entity28 has called for childminders to be allowed to take on more children at one time miss @entity28 said increasing the ratio in @entity1 would not compromise child safety			1
it would attract higher paid staff to the profession , improve the quality and availability of childcare , or make it more affordable , she added			0
miss @entity28 said : ‘ at the moment we have childminders getting an average income of £ 11,000 a year , so people are n’t going into childminding to a great extent			1
‘ we have half as many childminders as we had 10 years ago			1
it takes four to six months to register with ( childcare regulator ) @entity82			0
‘ we need to make it simpler			0
we need to make it attractive			0
’ the report also calls for a single funding system and for childminders to be able to register with a local agency , nursery or network which would take responsibility for inspection and training and be regulated by @entity82			1
miss @entity28 said costs were high because of ‘ duplication ’ in the way childminders are regulated , with both @entity82 and local authorities carrying out inspections			1
‘ i think a lot of money gets leaked away in the system , ’ she added			2
in the report the mp wrote : ' the coalition government has a great opportunity to simplify the provision of childcare and get better value for money for parents			2
' reform could lead to an increase in availability of flexible childcare and an end to spiralling costs			0
' but @entity117 , chief executive of the @entity118 , cast doubt over whether miss @entity28 's recommendations would make childcare cheaper for parents			1
he said : ‘ looking at the question of ratios , i think it will do very little in terms of reducing the cost of childcare			0
’ caring : the report stated that , while nursery places have increased , the number of childminder places has dropped drastically			0
( picture posed by models ) mr @entity117 called for more research focused on the ‘ trade - off ’ between having high quality care and allowing childminders to look after more children			2
‘ there is definitely a case for simplifying the funding stream , ’ he said			0
‘ it is very complicated for childcare			0
’ mr @entity117 questioned whether reducing regulation would bring down costs			0
he said : ‘ in the @entity19 , they went down this route a few years ago and they have had to row back on it because they have been so worried by quality			2
‘ the cost to the exchequer went up by 50 per cent			2
’ the proposals come three months after @entity154 confirmed it was considering a scheme to allow parents to borrow up to £ 10,000 to cope with childcare costs			2
independent think - tank , the @entity158 ( @entity159 ) , put forward the plan , which would take the form of a loan similar to those offered to students			0
a poll by @entity159 showed that 55 per cent of parents find childcare ' too expensive '			2
the think - tank has suggested a national childcare contribution scheme where parents who earn more than £ 12,000 annually could receive a lump sum			0
the loan would be repaid monthly over an extended period and at a low interest rate through the tax system .			0

the average @entity1 family spends 27 per cent of its net income on childminders
parents in the @entity19 spend only 10 per cent
