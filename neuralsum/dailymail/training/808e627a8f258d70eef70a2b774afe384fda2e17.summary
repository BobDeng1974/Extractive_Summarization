i suppose because i enjoyed work and missed being busy during the day i was comfort eating			2
' i would buy chocolate bars to snack on whilst cooking the family meal			2
i would wade through packets of biscuits whilst watching daytime tv and drink untold cups of cappuccino			2
i would always serve a dessert sweet after our family meal			2
my eating was out of control			2
