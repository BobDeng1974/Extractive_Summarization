by @entity0 published : 13:51 est , 9 august 2013 updated : 13:53 est , 9 august 2013 an @entity2 judge is leading a radical scheme to try and break the grip of the mafia by taking their children away from them before they become part of the family business			1
@entity10 , president of the juvenile court in @entity12 in southern @entity2 , says the drastic measure is the only way to tackle mafia gangs because they are built around family ties			1
' we needed to find a way to break this cycle that transmits negative cultural values from father to son , ' he told the @entity23			2
turf war : @entity25 was arrested after six @entity2 were shot dead in @entity26 , @entity27 , 2007 in an explosion of violence between rival mafia gangs @entity12 is home of the increasingly notorious ' @entity32 mafia			1
less well - known than other crime families , it is now believed to be the most powerful in @entity2 , controlling much of the drug trade into @entity36 through @entity37			1
domination : the ' @entity40 control much of @entity12 in southerin @entity2 after a huge crackdown in 2011 , 110 mobsters were jailed for a total of more than 1,000 years			2
but the gang 's stranglehold on the impoverished region remains strong			2
police have found it particularly hard to penetrate the ' @entity32 because it is family - based and informers are rare			1
with this in mind , judge @entity10 felt compelled to take an alternative approach to combating organised crime			0
he had begun to see a number of boys in his court who were the sons of mafia bosses he had sentenced in the @entity59			1
instead of seeing them follow in the inevitable footsteps of their fathers , he made the decision to start taking them away from their families			0
' as president of the court , i took some decisions , ' he told the @entity23			0
he began taking a keen interest in the children of well - known mafia families aged around 14 or 15 who had ' started to acquire the mafiosi mentality ' as @entity76 puts it			1
around 15 children - mostly boys - have been taken away so far and placed in care homes			0
they are no in prison and can visit their families at weekends			0
detained : @entity2 police take a man into custody during a recent crackdown on the ' @entity32 mafia family @entity76 says the courts are focusing on boys who are involved in low - level crimes such as stealing or vandalism and their families show little interest			1
' our objective is to show these young men a different world from the one they grew up in , ' he says			0
' if you are a boy whose father , uncle or grandfather is a mafioso , then there 's no - one who can set rules - and we provide them with a context			0
' the intention is that intervening early will encourage the youngsters to choose not to follow a life of crime through their own volition			0
when they are 18 , they can return to their families and it will be their own decision			0
but it will not be an easy choice , as ' @entity32 expert @entity116 explains			2
the ' @entity32 , based in @entity12 in the far south of @entity2 , is now believed to be the most powerful of @entity2 's four mafia organisations			1
they have grown from a rural mob to a brand - name international criminal syndicate			0
in the past decade , the ' @entity32 has emerged as a powerful and aggressive organization , becoming one of the world 's biggest cocaine traffickers			1
the origins of the ' @entity32 are thought to date back to shortly after @entity2 unification in 1861 when secret societies were established in @entity12			1
the group confined its activities to @entity12 until the 1970s , after which it began to target rich businessmen and their relatives for ransom kidnappings in northern @entity2			2
the organisation turned its attention to drugs in the 1990s , importing cocaine from @entity138 and distributing it around @entity36			0
police have found it hard to penetrate the ' @entity32 because it is family - based and @entity142 are rare			1
however , last year police arrested around 300 alleged @entity144 , dealing the organisation a major blow			0
@entity2 's @entity148 institute has estimated that the ' @entity32 's turnover from trafficking in drugs and arms , prostitution and extortion amounts to more than 40 billion euros a year - the equivalent of three percent of @entity2 's gross domestic product			1
' there 's a religious baptism and a mafioso baptism , which is confirmed when you reach a certain age , ' he told the @entity23			0
' so this means that , often , the children of bosses - particularly the first - born - are predestined to follow in their father 's footsteps			0
' the programme is still in an experimental stage , but if successful it will be rolled out in other parts of @entity2 .			2

@entity171 says drastic action is only way to ' break the cycle '
powerful ' @entity32 gang in southern @entity2 is built aroudn family ties
court intervenes when sons of mafia families commit low - level crimes
@entity184 is that they will choose not to join mafia business themselves
