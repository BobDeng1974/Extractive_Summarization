so the farewell tour will fizzle out rather than end with a bang			1
@entity2 hoped his @entity4 career would end at @entity5 but now the curtain will fall in @entity7			1
the dream was for @entity2 to end his 25 - year association with @entity4 by lifting the @entity10 on his 35th birthday before starting his new adventure with @entity13 yet now the prospect is nothing like so glamorous			1
losing to @entity16 in sunday ’s semi-final will take time to get over			0
‘ we did n’t play , we looked very nervous , ’ said @entity2 on @entity19			2

with the injured @entity39 facing two weeks out , it is inconceivable to think @entity2 will not start			2
on may 10 comes a trip to @entity41 where it is possible that @entity4 will have to form a guard of honour to welcome @entity34 , the champions - in - waiting			2
@entity16 midfielder @entity45 scored the winning goal to crush @entity2 's @entity10 final dream @entity2 's final game at @entity37 as a @entity4 player will come in the league against @entity35 on may 16 @entity2 ’s final game at @entity37 is scheduled for may 16 against @entity35			1
then , after more than 700 games and countless golden moments , the end for @entity2 and @entity4 will come at @entity7 ’s @entity55 on sunday , may 24			1
@entity2 is likely to begin his new career in mid-july once the @entity58 transfer window opens — possibly when @entity13 meet @entity59 on july 17 , the same day @entity4 play their first pre-season friendly in @entity61			1
april 27 , 2014 : with @entity4 seemingly set for the @entity63 title , @entity2 slips to gift @entity34 a goal in a 2 - 0 defeat at @entity37 to put the initiative back into the hands of eventual champions @entity69			1

december 9 , 2014 : the captain scores but @entity4 are knocked out of the @entity87 after a 1 - 1 draw with @entity90 leaves them on just five points in @entity92 january 27 , 2015 : @entity4 are knocked out of the @entity93 at the semi-final stage after losing 1 - 0 to @entity34 in extra time at @entity41 , with @entity2 unable to inspire a victory			2
february 26 , 2015 : @entity2 misses @entity98 tie with @entity99 through injury and they crash out on penalties in @entity103			0

@entity2 no *longer* has chance of ending @entity4 career on high
the @entity4 ace was hoping to win @entity10 in last *appearance* for @entity132
@entity2 will face the likes of @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity7 in final six matches
