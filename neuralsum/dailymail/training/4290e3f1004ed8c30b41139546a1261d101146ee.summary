it encourages you to ‘ tune in ’ to your body to release pent - up tension			1
being told to ‘ smile ’ can be annoying , but it might help your health			1
psychologists asked students to watch cartoons and rate how funny they were			1
some were asked to hold a pencil between their lips , to mimic a scowl			1
others held a pencil between their teeth , simulating a smile			1
those forced to smile found the cartoons funnier			1
the process works in reverse too – frowning makes you unhappy			1
and a tense neck , back or shoulders can trigger anxiety and stress			1
not only are emotions driven by such vicious cycles			2
pain creates tension in the body			1
the brain responds by turning up the ‘ volume ’ on its pain amplifiers , creating even more suffering			1
meditation can stop that cycle			1
clinical trials show mindfulness can reduce pain by about 90 per cent and , with practice , your pain and suffering can evaporate			1
the following @entity12 meditation helps the body ‘ unlearn ’ tension			1
do it once a day			2
follow these instructions or download a free audio track from @entity65			2

gently hold and support your right elbow in your left hand			2
rotate your right hand at the wrist in a circle for 30 seconds			0
keep your breathing soft and even , and relax your arms			0
then turn your wrist in the other direction for another 30 seconds			0
mindful moves : the correct exercise can see chronic pain and aches banished forever notice the effects of the movement on your right hand and arm			1
does this side feel different from the left ? more alive ? switch elbows and repeat the movement with the other hand , again thinking of its effects			0
then relax your arms so they hang at your sides			0
gently shake your hands and arms			0
what sensations do you feel ? - tune into your breathing			0

feel a corresponding opening in the chest , with the shoulder blades drawing together			0
