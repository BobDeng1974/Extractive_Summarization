@entity0 is confident his talent alone can carry him to this year 's formula one world title			1
@entity0 , who was pictured enjoying a sunshine break on the @entity4 with girlfriend @entity5 , heads into a race he singled out earlier this season as one of the two he was desperate to win			1
after missing out on @entity9 in contentious circumstances to @entity12 team - mate @entity11 , the priority for @entity0 is to now take the chequered flag at the @entity16 @entity15 at @entity17			1
two retirements this campaign have proved expensive for @entity0 , in contrast to @entity11 who has not been out of the top two in the eight races to date			1
@entity0 , though , has no intention of relying on any misfortune to @entity11 to aid his cause			2
asked of @entity0 whether he was a believer in situations balancing themselves out and that @entity11 was due a couple of retirements , he replied : ' i 'm not convinced that 's the case			2
' that would mean in the next 11 races @entity50 would need to have two he does not finish , and i do not think that is going to happen			0
' i can not rely on that , i just have to focus on doing better than him , which i am capable of			0
' the edge i have is in my ability			0
that is the gift i have and i have to utilise it this year more than ever			0
' @entity59 looks ahead to the @entity16 @entity15 controversial : @entity0 lost out to teammate @entity11 ( c ) under contentious circumstances at the @entity9 @entity0 has no doubt he is quicker than @entity11 , although has been forced to settle for second best in two of the last three races he has finished , with @entity65 an exception given his retirement			1
in @entity9 , @entity0 was on course for pole when yellow flags caused by on off - track excursion from @entity11 forced him to back off , sparking that weekend 's controversy between the two			1
in @entity73 10 days ago , @entity0 was twice on course for pole again , only to make mistakes that saw him start ninth to @entity11 's third			2
' i 'm happy i managed to recover that weekend			0
i earned my money , so that was good , " said @entity0 , who was runner - up behind @entity11			2
' i know i 'm 29 points down now , but even though i 've not finished as many races as i would like and i lost another seven points to @entity50 in @entity73 , there 's still a long way to go			1
@entity87 setter : @entity11 leads the driver 's championships by 29 points after victory in @entity73 ' i had a lot of pace in @entity73 , and although i did n't capitalise on it , i 'll take it into the @entity16 @entity15 and make sure i do			1
' i 'm excited about our pace			0
i 'm going to @entity17 with the best package i 've ever had , so i 'm thrilled about that ' i just have to execute that pace over a weekend , so i will work hard to make sure i do that			2
" it could be argued @entity0 is due at least some luck bearing in mind what occurred in last year 's grand prix			2
after qualifying on pole by half a second , @entity0 comfortably led the race , only to become the first of five victims of @entity111 tyre blowouts , ultimately finishing fourth			0
it means @entity0 goes into this weekend still with only one @entity16 gp win to his name , that back in 2008			1
@entity116 's @entity17 simulator true @entity117 : @entity0 has targeted @entity17 as the race he wants to win after a blowout last season despite that , @entity0 said : ' last year was my best chance of another win and i should have won that one			1
' i have definitely had my fair share of bad luck , that 's for sure , so hopefully moving forwards positive things will happen			0
' at least in going to the @entity16 @entity15 - for any athlete going into an event in their home country - performing for the fans and the support you have is significantly more than any other place you go			1
confident : @entity0 believes his talent alone will lead him to the @entity140 driver 's world title speed demon : the @entity16 @entity140 driver believes he has the edge in ability over teammate @entity11 ' it 's just the most incredible feeling , particularly with the difference you can make to those individuals ' weekends			1
' when i won the race in 2008 , i had so many messages of support			0
even today people tell me their dream came true that weekend			0
' that 's a real positive			0
lots of positives come from these events so i 'm excited to be going back there this weekend			0

@entity0 believes his ability alone will win the @entity140 world title
