by @entity0 @entity1 was diagnosed with stress when she was actually suffering from blood cots @entity1 was fit , young and had no history of health problems			1
so when the 23 - year - old started suffering dizzy spells up to three times a day , doctors were baffled			1
' the first happened when i was shopping - i suddenly felt faint , ' says @entity1 , a charity fundraiser from @entity13 , @entity14			1
' my legs went weak and my friend had to hold me up then get me home in a taxi			0
i thought perhaps i just needed a sugar boost , such as a bar of chocolate			0
' but the dizzy spells kept occurring - sometimes i 'd get them up to three times a day , then i would n't get them for a few weeks and think i was getting better			1
' i 'd feel sick for 20 minutes afterwards and my vision would go slightly blurry			2
sometimes i 'd feel just a bit lightheaded , but once i had to crouch down in a corner holding on to the carpet because i felt i was falling			2
' @entity1 visited her gp a few days after the first attack and over the course of the next month saw half a dozen specialists , including an eye expert			1
each suggested a different diagnosis , ranging from iron deficiency to an inner ear infection			0
she was referred to a psychiatrist when a neurologist insisted her symptoms were stress - related			0
' i was working as a social worker for a mental health charity and loved my job and was n't stressed at all , but the psychiatrist suggested i give it up and work as a fisherman , perhaps because he thought it was a relaxing profession			0
' my mum and i just laughed , though when someone tells you the problem is in your subconscious you believe them			0
' she was prescribed antidepressants and beta - blockers , which control anxiety by slowing down the heart rate			2
but these did n't make her better and she decided to quit her job and move in with her mother - by then her legs would shake so uncontrollably she was terrified of falling and was forced to use a wheelchair			0
then in october 2010 , six months after her first symptoms , she started to experience chest pains and her eyes became swollen			0
a few weeks later , she woke up one morning hallucinating			0
she was rushed to @entity67 , where she drifted in and out of consciousness while doctors carried out a scan			0
this revealed the cause of her problems : her lungs were filled with blood clots			1
the clots had blocked the artery carrying blood from the heart to the lungs , starving her body of oxygen - a condition known as a pulmonary embolism			1
the fact @entity1 was young and had no underlying health problems meant that the life - threatening problem had gone undetected until nearly too late , despite her having classic symptoms , such as dizziness and chest pain			1
if the clot breaks off , it can travel up the vein to the heart and get stuck in an artery in the lungs , starving the body of oxygen			1
every year blood clots cause 30,000 deaths - official estimates suggest as many as 25,000 people die from preventable blood clots that develop in hospital			1
this is partly because lying immobile in a hospital bed or on an operating table causes the blood to pool and thicken			2
surgery can also lead to clots - patients considered at risk are given blood - thinning drugs and compression stockings for their hospital stay			1
the clots can take some time to form - more than half occur up to 90 days after a stay in hospital			2
while clots can happen to anyone , the risk increases if you 're overweight , which slows down the blood flow			1
and pregnant women are more at risk , partly because of the increase in blood - clotting cells			2
the drop in your blood flow after sitting for 90 minutes blood clots are often regarded as a disease of ageing - rates increase sharply after 45 until 80 , though it 's not clear why			1
another risk factor is the combined oral contraceptive pill , taken by two million women in @entity152 aged 16 to 49			0
it contains oestrogen , which causes the blood to clot more easily			2
@entity1 's doctors told her it was the @entity158 , which she 'd been taking since the age of 18 , which had triggered the blood clots			1
the problem is that many doctors and nurses do not realise that blood clots can affect adults of all ages , not just those over 45 , says professor @entity169 , medical director of the charity @entity171 issue is that many health professionals are unaware a patient can have a blood clot even if their leg is n't swollen			1
the warning signs include unexplained pain in the leg muscle , such as a sharp or achy cramp , but sometimes there are no symptoms			0
' i run a clinic for young people and teenagers who have had blood clots and what i often hear from them , including those in their 20s , is : “ i had a pain in my leg and went to a health professional , but they said i was too young to have a blood clot , ” ' says professor @entity169			1
' many people are under the impression that thrombosis ( blood clots ) is an older person 's illness			1
yet we have evidence to show this is n't the case			0
' we need to break the myth that thrombosis is an old people 's condition or that you 're only likely to suffer from blood clots after a long - haul flight			1
the @entity208 is also a risk factor , for instance			2
we 've learned a lot about blood clots in the past five to ten years , but most gps attended medical school before that			1
the clots had blocked the artery carrying blood from the heart to the lungs , starving her body of oxygen ' in old - fashioned textbooks you see someone and they have a huge swollen leg , but 80 per cent of leg clots do n't cause swelling			1
' they just cause pain in part of the leg and a lot of doctors are unaware of that			0
' more education needs to be done to make sure that frontline staff recognise the symptoms of thrombosis which , if not treated early , is an indiscriminate and devastating killer			0
' after @entity1 's condition was diagnosed , she spent four days in intensive care , where she was given the clot - busting drug heparin			2
she was then put on warfarin to prevent new clots			2
after ten days in hospital she went home , but it took two years for her to recover fully			0
she has been switched to the @entity208 , which does n't contain oestrogen			2
four years since the pulmonary embolism , she feels lucky to be alive			1
she is fundraising and campaigning for @entity252 to raise awareness to ensure other young people get diagnosed quickly			0
' a clot can happen to anyone and it only takes one on the lung to kill you			0
if my mum had n't been home that day i 'd have died , ' she says			2
' it was only later i discovered the hospital had told my friends and family to say goodbye because they did n't think i 'd survive			0
' i 'm one of the lucky ones , so i 'm passionate about raising awareness to prevent misdiagnosis among younger people			0
' what she finds frustrating is that doctors and nurses do n't realise that clots can affect young people			0
' when i was on warfarin , i 'd get doctors at the clinic in hospital and nurses at the gp surgery telling me i should n't be taking it because i was n't at risk of clots at my age , even after being diagnosed			1
' people still think it 's just a problem that affects older people or long - haul passengers			0
' but as she knows from terrifying experience , that 's a potentially life - threatening mistake			0

@entity1 , 23 , from @entity13 , suffered *recurring* dizzy spells
she had pulmonary embolism and her lungs were filled with blood clots
they blocked the artery carrying blood from the heart to the lungs
the @entity208 , which she 'd been taking since age of 18 , triggered the clots
