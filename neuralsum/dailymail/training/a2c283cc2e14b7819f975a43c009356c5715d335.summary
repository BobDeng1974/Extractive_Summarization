the video , which has been posted on @entity6 , shows the drunk man launching a foul - mouthed tirade of abuse at the innocent woman			1
commuters were left horrified as the man , from @entity13 , @entity14 , reeled off a series of insults about the @entity18 - labelling them ' nasty people ' , ' bad men ' and a ' vicious bunch '			1
in an expletive - littered rant , lasting almost six minutes , the man claims his uncle died in the @entity35 during the @entity36			1
he then aggressively points his finger at the young woman and accuses her of torturing his relative			2
get yourself off the train , get yourself off the train , ' he can be heard telling the passenger , who is sat on the other side of the tube on the @entity49 line			0
' you 're nasty people			1
i mean this s * * *			0
' f * * * off , get out of my country			0
' illogical : he aggressively points his finger at the female passenger and accuses her of torturing his uncle the unidentified man , who appears to be under the influence of alcohol , then repeatedly shouts ' @entity60 ' - the @entity18 translation of ' goodbye ' - adding : ' do n't you torture my relatives '			1
he ignores the shocked woman 's cries of ' i 'm not nasty			1
you 're nasty ' , before turning his attention to the @entity69 man filming the footage and asking where he comes from			1
the passenger replies : ' does it matter , really ? are you going to start sorting everyone on the train , man , one by one ? why are you blasting at her ? what have you got against the @entity18 ? ' leaning forward , the man shouts : ' they killed my f * * * * * * two f * * * * * * cousins in the @entity36			1
' ' but she did n't kill your cousins , did she ? ' asks the passenger			0
' why is she going to apologise ? what has she done to you ? ' the man , pointing his finger at the @entity18 woman , replies ' she does n't even f * * * * * * realise that she 's a bad man			1
the @entity18 are bad - same as the @entity94			1
' menacing : the unidentified man then repetedly shouts ' @entity60 ' - the @entity18 translation of ' goodbye ' despite the cameraman 's best efforts to calm him down , the man then becomes increasingly violent - threatening to knock him out in ' one punch '			1
' i ’m @entity102 ! what do you know ? you 're a f * * * * * * boy man			2
shut the f * * * up , ' he says			0
' i ’ve done two tours in @entity108 and the @entity109			0
do n’t even f * * * * * * look at me			0
' he then produces a bottle of wine and takes a swig , before dangling the bottle menacingly in the passenger 's face			0
' do you want some of that ? ' he asks threateningly			0
' no , because you do n't drink			0

he is expected to be brought before magistrates on october 30			0
the abuse is not the first of its kind to be filmed on the @entity4			0

@entity148 , then 42 , snarled at stunned commuters seated beside her : ' i used to live in @entity69 and now i live in the @entity151			0
' her champagne - fuelled rant was recorded by a passenger , who posted the seven - minute clip on @entity6 where it caused a sensation			2
