peering over the wall at the bottom of his garden , @entity0 received an education in the art of being a striker that money can not buy			1
when @entity9 head to @entity10 , aiming to strike another blow for @entity13 sides in the @entity14 , @entity0 will think back to the days when he studied @entity15 and @entity16 , and later @entity17 and @entity18			1
@entity0 ’s family home in @entity22 backs on to @entity24 ’s training ground but of the current forwards he monitors , it is @entity26 who is a continued source of inspiration for a young man who holds a record for scoring hat - tricks for @entity24 schoolboys that even @entity15 can not match			1
@entity26 ’s route was similarly unconventional			2
@entity0 is a ‘ mad @entity51 ’ and his dream in this season ’s @entity14 is to get through today ’s challenge before locking horns at @entity56 against his boyhood heroes			1
‘ we have got a shed at the back of the house , so i used to climb on top of it and watch them train , ’ says the 22 - year - old			1
‘ me and my sister , @entity65 , would get autographs most days and speak to the players			0
@entity15 was my hero and i ’ve still got his shirt on my wall			2
’ had @entity0 ’s career gone as he envisaged , he would be playing for @entity70			2
he was scouted by the late @entity71 as a schoolboy and his logic was that going to @entity74 would increase his chances of playing in the @entity76			0
@entity0 also used to watch former @entity24 strikers @entity17 and @entity18 from his garden but a broken foot , sustained in a freak schoolyard accident , damaged his ambitions and after leaving @entity70 , he had spells with @entity83 , non-league side @entity84 , @entity86 ’s @entity85 and @entity87 before ending up with @entity9			1
‘ i was in school and slipped on the wet floor and cracked my bone right through , just coming down a couple of steps , ’ he says			0
‘ i played for @entity70 ’s reserves , trained with the first team but never got to the level i wanted			0
it was devastating but that happens in football , does n’t it ? ’ fairytales , however , also happen and @entity0 added : ‘ i think people like seeing @entity13 clubs have a bit of a run			2
‘ we all watched @entity105 beat @entity106 and we were buzzing			0
then you see @entity108 and that ’s a great story			0
we ’d love one of our own			0
