@entity0 want @entity2 defender @entity1 but do n't expect the @entity3 to be willing to discuss any transfer until next summer at the earliest			1
@entity2 are an affluent club but have an unwritten policy of selling one major star a year and @entity8 is anticipated to be the next to leave with a clause kicking in which allows him to go for £ 24million			2
@entity8 has been injured but his departure , with @entity12 and @entity13 very much in the frame for his signature , will still prompt an irate reaction from fans			0
@entity0 will wait until next summer before making a bid for @entity2 's @entity1 @entity1 is @entity2 's club captain and would help aid @entity0 's vulnerability problems in defence that would put even more pressure on the club not to sell @entity26 international @entity25 , who is also club captain			1
united chief executive @entity28 was very clear in his message this week that @entity0 are not hunting short term fixes in the january window			0
that may yet change if injuries fail to subside but the intention is to make a play for 25 - year - old @entity25 in the summer			0
should @entity2 show any willingness to deal , even then @entity0 will face competition from @entity39 's elite clubs particularly as quality centre - backs are in such short supply			1
@entity0 have been scouting defenders recently to keep on top of the market			0
they have watched @entity45 of @entity46 , @entity47 of @entity48 and @entity49 of @entity50 while @entity52 's @entity51 remains a possibility as his contract runs out in the summer			1
@entity0 may be forced to try and sign a player from that group should their injury crisis fail to subside			0
@entity2 's @entity8 ( right ) has a £ 24million buyout clause and is expected to leave the club this summer			2

@entity61 winner @entity1 is @entity2 's club captain
centre - back is a target for @entity0 who have *defensive* issues
@entity0 are also *interested* in @entity45 , @entity47 , @entity49 and @entity51
