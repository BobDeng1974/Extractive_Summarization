the largest mass extinction in the history of animal life occurred in just 60,000 years , scientists have revealed			1
the @entity5 extinction 252 million years ago wiped out more than 96 percent of marine species and 70 percent of life on land - including the largest insects known to have inhabited the @entity10			1
however , researchers admit they are still baffled by what caused it			0
multiple theories have aimed to explain the cause of what ¿ s now known as the end - @entity5 extinction , including massive volcanic eruptions			1
the @entity5 extinction 252 million years ago , wiped out more than 96 percent of marine species and 70 percent of life on land — including the largest insects known to have inhabited the @entity10			1
the leading theory among geologists and paleontologists has to do with widespread , long - lasting volcanic eruptions from the @entity26 , a region of @entity28 whose steplike hills are a result of repeated eruptions of magma			0
the new timeline adds weight to the theory that the extinction was triggered by massive volcanic eruptions from the @entity26 that released volatile chemicals , including carbon dioxide , into the atmosphere and oceans			1
multiple theories have aimed to explain the cause of what is known as the end - @entity5 extinction , including an asteroid impact , massive volcanic eruptions , or a cataclysmic cascade of environmental events			1
now researchers at @entity49 have determined that the end - @entity5 extinction occurred over 60,000 years , give or take 48,000 years which they say is ' practically instantaneous , from a geologic perspective '			1
the new timescale is based on more precise dating techniques , and indicates that the most severe extinction in history may have happened more than 10 times faster than scientists had previously thought			0
' we ’ve got the extinction nailed in absolute time and duration , ' says @entity61 , the @entity62 professor of @entity10 and @entity63 at @entity49			0
' how do you kill 96 percent of everything that lived in the oceans in tens of thousands of years ? it could be that an exceptional extinction requires an exceptional explanation			2
' in addition to establishing the extinction ’s duration , @entity61 , graduate student @entity70 , and a colleague from the @entity72 and @entity73 also found that , 10,000 years before the die - off , the oceans experienced a pulse of light carbon , which likely reflects a massive addition of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere			1
an asteroid impact may also have caused the extinction event , researchers say this dramatic change may have led to widespread ocean acidification and increased sea temperatures by 10 degrees @entity90 or more , killing the majority of sea life			2
the leading theory among geologists and paleontologists has to do with widespread , long - lasting volcanic eruptions from the @entity26 , a region of @entity28 whose steplike hills are a result of repeated eruptions of magma			0
to determine whether eruptions from the @entity26 triggered a massive increase in oceanic carbon dioxide , @entity70 and @entity61 are using similar dating techniques to establish a timescale for the @entity5 period ’s volcanic eruptions that are estimated to have covered over five million cubic kilometers			1
two nearly complete , articulated , mature specimens of the amphibian @entity112 , named the " @entity114 courting couple " , from central @entity115 in the @entity5 period ' it is clear that whatever triggered extinction must have acted very quickly , ' says @entity70 , the lead author of a paper that reports the results in this week ’s @entity121 , ' fast enough to destabilize the biosphere before the majority of plant and animal life had time to adapt in an effort to survive			2
' the new timeline adds weight to the theory that the extinction was triggered by massive volcanic eruptions from the @entity26 that released volatile chemicals , including carbon dioxide , into the atmosphere and oceans			2
with such a short extinction timeline , @entity61 says it is possible that a single , catastrophic pulse of magmatic activity triggered an almost instantaneous collapse of all global ecosystems			0
@entity142 , which lived during the @entity5 period , had a 72cm wingspan			0
it belongs to the extinct order of griffinflies ( @entity146 ) , related to dragonflies			0
@entity142 grew to a wingspan of at least 2.5 feet , and could have weighed upwards of a pound			0
the largest modern relative of @entity142 is the dragonfly @entity153 , which can attain a comparatively meager wingspan of 7.5 inches , or 19 cm.			0

the @entity5 extinction occurred 252 million years ago
wiped out more than 96 percent of marine species and 70 percent of life on land
scientists still do not know what caused it
10,000 years before the die - off a massive addition of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere occurred
