@entity0 are desperate to land @entity2 goalkeeper @entity1 , but they are prepared to wait until next summer if @entity4 wo n't negotiate , according to reports in @entity6			1
@entity1 has been in fantastic form this season , while @entity0 's legendary stopper @entity9 has long been seen as unreliable			1
although the @entity12 champions would like to sign @entity1 this june , they are looking at the possibility of picking up @entity15 's @entity14 to fill the gap in between , while the @entity17 runs down his contract at @entity19 , which expires next year			1
@entity0 's attempt to nab @entity1 is the big story in @entity22 , while @entity23 focus on @entity24 in a move that @entity6 paper as calls ' @entity26 ' , the paper claims @entity0 are only prepared to pay for the keeper if @entity2 ' fix a reasonable price ' - otherwise they will nab him for free in a year			1
@entity1 's contract is up at @entity19 in the summer of 2016 , and he is yet to sign a new deal , with @entity2 still uncertain of @entity37 football for next season			2
@entity14 , meanwhile , looks certain to leave @entity39 this summer , with the @entity41 keeper likely to command a fee of around £ 10million			2
elsewhere in @entity6 the focus is on @entity45 's injury , which is still causing him some problems ahead of @entity48 's trip to @entity49 on sunday			0
@entity50 say ' @entity45 is ok ' , with the news that ' all tests were positive ' on his injured foot , and @entity23 add that the @entity48 star has ' overcome the pain '			0
@entity45 's injury dominates in @entity50 , while in @entity57 there is more news on @entity60 's @entity59 however , the @entity0 - based paper also report that ' he still ca n’t put his boot on ' because of the injury to his metatarsal			2
there is better news for @entity24 , who is also set to return from injury , with @entity23 reporting that he will start for @entity0 on sunday , his first game for 59 days			0
in @entity57 there are reports that @entity60 striker @entity59 , who has been linked with @entity71 , could join up with former @entity73 manager @entity72 at @entity74			0
@entity50 reports that @entity74 are ready to offer £ 22million for the @entity76 youngster .			0

@entity1 is yet to extend his contract beyond 2016
@entity0 want the @entity6 goalkeeper to *replace* @entity9
as claim @entity0 will wait for contract to run down if they ca n't sign him
@entity85 wants @entity14 as a stop - gap if he has to wait until 2016
