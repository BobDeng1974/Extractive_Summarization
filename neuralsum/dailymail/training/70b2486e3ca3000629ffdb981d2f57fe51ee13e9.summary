it has fired the imagination of historians and archaeologists for centuries , but the mystery of the @entity6 may finally have been solved - with a surprising twist			0
a leading @entity9 - based historian says the fabled gardens , one of the @entity12 , were not built in @entity13 by @entity14 of @entity15			1
in fact they were n’t in @entity15 at all			1
dr @entity18 , of @entity9 ’s @entity19 , says the gardens were actually located 300 miles to the north in @entity22 , @entity24 's rival , by the @entity26 ruler @entity25			1
glory of the ancients : a sixteenth century illustration of the @entity6 , which may not have been in @entity15 at all			1
an @entity9 historian claims they were actually built in the @entity26 city of @entity22 she first put the proposal forward in 1992 and has spent 20 years piecing the mystery together , reports @entity35			1
there are four key components of dr @entity18 's theory , which will be outlined in a book released later this month			2
as she studied historical descriptions of the gardens , she discovered that a nineteenth century bas - relief from @entity25 ’s palace in @entity22 showed trees growing on a roofed colonnade exactly as described by early accounts			2
secondly , @entity22 , the @entity26 capital , became known as ' @entity24 ' when @entity26 conquered @entity15 in 689 bc - in fact , a number of places in the region were known by the name ' @entity15 '			1
she also discovered that the gates of @entity22 were renamed for those traditionally used for @entity15 ’s city gates after the successful invasion			1
thirdly , a geographical assessment found that the flat land surrounding @entity15 would have made delivering water to the @entity6 impossible			2
@entity13 in modern - day @entity61 was thought to be the site of the @entity6			0
dr @entity18 's research shows it may actually have been in @entity22 , 300 miles away finally , she believes that the original classical descriptions of the @entity6 were written by historians who had actually visited the @entity22 area , including accounts from @entity69 , whose army camped near the city in @entity73 , close to one of the great aqueducts that carried water to what dr @entity18 now believes to be the real site of the @entity6			1
she said : ' it ’s taken many years to find the evidence to demonstrate that the gardens and associated system of aqueducts and canals were built by @entity25 at @entity22 and not by @entity14 in @entity15			1
' for the first time it can be shown that the @entity6 really did exist			0
' incredibly , the revelations may mean that the @entity6 were the first of the seven ‘ wonders ’ of the world to be described as such			0
@entity25 referred to his palace gardens , as ' a wonder for all the peoples '			2
the @entity6 were one of the @entity12 , and the only one that may have been pure legend			0
accounts state they were built in the ancient city - state of @entity15 , near present - day @entity13 , @entity98 province , in @entity61			1
the gardens were attributed to the @entity100 king @entity14 , who ruled between 605 and 562 bc. he is reported to have constructed the gardens to please his wife @entity103 , who was said to pine for the plants of her homeland			2
it is not known what happened to the gardens			2
some theorise it was levelled by an earthquake			0
the @entity6 are documented by ancient @entity113 and @entity114 writers , including @entity115 , @entity116 , and @entity117			0
@entity119 historian @entity118 once described it			0
he said : ' in this palace he ( @entity14 ) erected very high walks , supported by stone pillars ; and by planting what was called a pensile paradise , and replenishing it with all sorts of trees , he rendered the prospect an exact resemblance of a mountainous country			0
' this he did to gratify his queen , because she had been brought up in @entity133 , and was fond of a mountainous situation			0
' however , no definitive archaeological evidence concerning their whereabouts has been found .			0

*prominent* historian claims lost @entity140 was not built in @entity15
her research shows the gardens were in *neighbouring* @entity26
the evidence shows @entity24 's conquerors were the likely *architects*
