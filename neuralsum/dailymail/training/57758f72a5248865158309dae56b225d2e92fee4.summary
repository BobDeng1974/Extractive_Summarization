a man who was released from prison after spending 26 years on death row is rebuilding his life with the help of an @entity6 wishlist - donated to him by the kindness of strangers			1
@entity10 , 64 , had been on death row since august 1988 in connection with the death of 56 - year - old @entity14 , a @entity16 jeweler and watchmaker for whom mr @entity10 had done occasional yard work			1
but his conviction was quashed and he walked free from @entity21 in @entity21 , on the 12 march , wearing a simple jean jacket , jumper and beanie hat , carrying all of his worldly possessions in two tiny boxes			0
the debit card , along with the money that he had in his bank account left mr @entity10 with a paltry $ 20.04 to his name			1
as he walked out of the prison gates , a tv crew from @entity42 asked him how he felt about his release			0
he said : ' it feels good ; my mind is going in all kind of directions			0
' but as he began to put the pieces of his life back together , the newly exonerated man had absolutely no way to support himself financially after spending nearly three decades behind bars			2
in light of this , @entity59 's @entity31 director , @entity58 - who acted as mr @entity10 's lawyers when he was exonerated - decided to step in and help him by setting up an @entity6 wishlist ( which can be found here			1
) wishlist : this is the @entity6 wishlist set up for mr @entity10 to help him get his life back on track it would enable him to receive donations for things that would help him put his life back together			1
the simple list of around 49 items include an ironing board and a pair of men 's silk pyjamas			0
and mr @entity58 said that after mr @entity10 's release he began getting calls from strangers asking how they could help , donate and contribute			1
@entity77 , an @entity78 , was tried and convicted of first - degree murder by an all - white jury panel in 1984 and sentenced to death			2
nearly three decades on , much had changed in the world and technology had advanced in ways that mr @entity10 simply could not have imagined			2
there were now smart phones , ipods , @entity89 and the internet			0
lawyers in the @entity59 's office were keen to give mr @entity10 a taste of modern technology and put a second generation ipad on the wishlist			1
but the freed inmate is struggling to get to grips with using a mobile phone			0
lost years : upon leaving death row , @entity10 told reporters that he does harbor some resentment at being wrongly jailed and denied the chance to help raise his sons , who are now grown men the groundwork for @entity77 's release was based off a confession by confidential informant @entity109 who revealed that he was the one who pulled the trigger , killing @entity14			1
@entity109 was one of four people initially charged in the killing			0
the other three were @entity77 , @entity114 and the informant 's brother , @entity115			0
state district judge @entity117 voided mr @entity10 's conviction and sentence based on the new information that corroborated his claim that he was not present or involved in @entity14 's death			1
his lawyers @entity58 and @entity124 said @entity10 's trial had been ' profoundly compromised by inexperienced counsel and by the unconstitutional suppression of evidence , including information from an informant			2
' they also cited what they said was a suppressed police report related to the time of the crime and evidence involving the murder weapon			0
the victim 's family were also notified of @entity77 's release from death row earlier this month			2
' we understand that and actually believe the @entity147 is acting honorably , ' the slain jeweler 's nephew , dr @entity143 , told @entity148			0
' this is positive reflection on the criminal justice system that does the right thing for people			0
on his release , @entity10 told @entity42 he does harbour some resentment at being wrongly jailed			2
' yeah , cause , i 've been locked up almost 30 years for something i did n't do , ' the freed inmate said			0
' i ca n't go back and do anything i should have been doing when i was 35 , 38 , 40 stuff like that			0
' the newly liberated man added he was sad that he had not been there to raise his sons , who are now grown men			0
wrongful conviction : @entity77 , an @entity78 ( pictured in booking photos ) , was tried and convicted of first - degree murder by an all - white jury panel in 1984 and sentenced to death under state law , @entity31 is required to pay mr @entity10 $ 25,000 in compensation for wrongful imprisonment			1
mr @entity10 is also eligible for $ 80,000 for loss of life opportunity , but getting the money is nâ€™t guaranteed , especially if state officials contest it , according to mr @entity58			1
however , mr @entity58 hopes that mr @entity10 can begin to change his life with the things donated on the @entity6 wishlist			1
lockup : @entity10 had spent the past 26 years at the @entity21 penitentiary - one of the largest maximum security prisons in the world with two death row units			1

@entity10 , 64 , spent 26 years *awaiting* execution for 1983 shooting death of jewelers and *clockmaker* @entity14
his death sentence was voided earlier this month after *prosecutors* uncovered new information proving that mr @entity10 was not the *shooter*
he has begun to rebuild his life with the help of an @entity6 wishlist donated to him by total strangers who just wanted to help
