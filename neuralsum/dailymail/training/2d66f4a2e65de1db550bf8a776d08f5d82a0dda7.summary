' following sentencing , assistant chief constable @entity255 of @entity13 said : ' the sentence handed to @entity2 today not only reflects the severity of the offences she committed but also the fact that she used her position as a police officer when committing a number of these offences			1
' in her role as a police officer , she should have known better			0
' we expect the highest standards of conduct from all of our employees and this kind of behaviour has no place in @entity13			0
