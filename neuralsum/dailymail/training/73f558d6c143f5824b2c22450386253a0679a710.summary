' mrs @entity46 described her father 's experience of flying the @entity204 , which were outmatched in speed and armour against the @entity14 's more modern fighters			0
she said : ' they were bombers which were dressed up as fighters as they had put on some extra guns , but they were n't fast so you could not give good chase to enemy planes			0
' and if they chased after you , you could n't outrun them , so they nicknamed it the @entity219			0
' a lot of men flew less hours and never made it through the war , so it 's miraculous he survived			0
