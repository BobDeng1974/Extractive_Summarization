cheesy chocolate ? you have got to be kidding me			1
well , no. at least , not according to the @entity11 , a bunch of cooking experts who have proclaimed chocolate and cheese muddled up together as the next big foodie trend of 2014			1
and they 're not just talking chocolate cheesecake , chocolate and ricotta puddings or chocolate @entity16 - essentially a super-creamy @entity18			1
they 're talking roquefort and cinnamon chocolate doughnuts , chocolate and @entity24 blue cake , goat 's cheese and lemon ganache , and @entity29 and @entity30 truffles			1
cheese and chocolate , served together , are set to be the next big thing in food masterclass : @entity36 shared his stilton truffle recipe with foodie @entity39 fans in @entity40 the group have been moved to rave about the pongy pairing since foodie fans on @entity44 have started sharing chocolatier @entity36 's port and stilton truffle recipe with gusto			1
it may initially seem counter-intuitive , but chocolate and cheese have long been considered good plate - fellows by the professionals , and experimental molecular gastronomists including @entity55 ( @entity56 ) and @entity57 ( @entity58 ) have been celebrating the flavour pairing in dishes for some time			1
the discovery that chocolate and blue cheese share multiple flavour compounds led to the creation of @entity55 's molten chocolate and blue cheese cake			1
and while we may wince at the idea of dunking a @entity71 in a blue cheese fondue , more and more chefs are trying to bring us round to their way of thinking			1
never be forced to choose between chocolate and cheese ever again when these two start appearing on menus together @entity76 and @entity77 teamed up to make @entity16 chocolate recently @entity80 at @entity79 told @entity81 : ' @entity55 was one of the first chefs in the @entity83 to develop blue cheese and chocolate as a pairing with his famous @entity88 chocolate and blue cheese cake			1
' chocolate and blue cheese share 73 flavour compounds , so there 's actually a scientific reason as to why we find the mix appealing			1
@entity36 has been surprising @entity83 chocaholics with chocolate and cheese pairings for a while , particularly his best - loved being @entity29 and @entity30 truffles and goat 's cheese and lemon ganache			1
and @entity106 @entity105 , who runs a number of award - winning restaurants in @entity40 , has created a recipe for cinnamon doughnuts filled with a unique blend of white chocolate and roquefort cheese			1
everyone knows that soft , mild cheeses such as ricotta and cream cheese go well with chocolate ... but what about stronger cheeses such as @entity121 ? @entity122 has @entity124 's @entity123 on his book shelf in @entity126 @entity124 is the author of @entity127 , a food pairing bible that explains which flavours go well together and why			1
( her comprehensive and utterly mouthwatering guide to taste was , incidentally , spotted on the prime minister 's personal bookshelf just last week			1
) in her book @entity124 explains that she discovered the pairing of chocolate and cheese at a @entity36 tasting			1
apprehensive at first , she said the two flavours work because of ' how comparable it is to chocolate and milk ( or cream ) and , further , how the flavour notes in some good chocolate - spicy berry fruits , dried fruits , caramels - are natural partners for cheese '			1
