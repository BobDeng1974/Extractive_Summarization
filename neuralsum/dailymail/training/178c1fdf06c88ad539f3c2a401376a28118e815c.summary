the campaign to save the @entity1 has more than doubled its lead to a record high following @entity5 's tv debate meltdown , a sensational new poll has revealed			1
an exclusive survey for the @entity9 @entity8 has found that viewers overwhelmingly believe @entity11 crushed his opponent , and nearly a quarter of those who watched are now more likely to reject independence			1
at the end of a torrid week for the @entity16 , mr @entity5 now has only 39 days of campaigning to revive his lifeless bid to break - up @entity18 before the historic referendum on september 18			2
that is a remarkable four point increase in the space of a single week , with only 37 per cent now in favour of a @entity40 vote – down three points			0
when undecided voters are excluded , the no camp is on 57 per cent – a massive 14 - point lead over @entity40 , compared to just a six - point lead last sunday			0
mr @entity5 's failure to answer questions about the currency of an independent @entity9 is at the heart of the dramatic collapse			1
more than two - thirds of the 1,010 @entity9 polled by @entity28 said the first minister should produce a ' plan b ' to his unrealistic bid to keep the pound before voters cast their ballots			1
asked to pick adjectives to describe the @entity16 leader 's performance in the pivotal @entity62 debate last tuesday – which was watched by 1.7million people – the most popular choices were ' weak ' , ' uninformed ' and ' dishonest '			0
his opponent , former chancellor mr @entity11 who is spearheading the @entity24 campaign , was described as ' knowledgeable ' and ' strong '			2
mr @entity5 's leadership is now under unprecedented scrutiny , with senior @entity16 figures privately briefing against him throughout the week and some suggesting his deputy @entity70 should replace him for a crunch tv debate on the @entity72 later this month			2
the survey found that viewers overwhelmingly thought that @entity11 ( right ) crushed opponent @entity9 's first minister @entity5 ( left ) during a live televised debate on tuesday night alarmingly for the first minister , 15 per cent of @entity9 who backed the @entity16 in the 2011 @entity79 election would be more likely to vote @entity40 in the referendum if @entity82 was the leader			1
a staggering 45 per cent of independence supporters now believe @entity82 should represent the @entity40 camp in the @entity72 debate on august 25			0
and to compound the crisis for mr @entity5 , the collapse in support is largely due to huge numbers of female voters who have switched to the no camp in recent days			0
@entity92 , director of research at @entity28 , said : ' following his unexpected success in the debate , @entity11 has seen support for no jump to its highest ever level in a @entity28 poll , at 50 per cent and a 13 - point lead			1
' whilst this post-debate boost may fade over time , with little over a month remaining until @entity9 head to the polls it looks as though @entity5 is fast running out of time to turn things around			1
barring a dramatic reversal in the next debate , the dreams of @entity9 nationalists appear increasingly likely to be dashed come september 18			2
' during a visit to @entity112 yesterday , @entity110 leader @entity109 told the @entity8 : ' i think what this shows is that tuesday night was a very big moment because of @entity11 's persistent and very forensic questioning			0
@entity5 was exposed on a central question about the referendum and an independent @entity9 's currency			1
' i think what has been laid bare is that he has no plan , he has no answers , and i think a lot of people seeking to make up their minds in this referendum will be thinking this is just too big a risk when there 's no answer on the currency			0
' mr @entity11 hammered his rival over his plans for a currency if @entity9 back independence in the referendum mr @entity11 added : ' what 's happening is the closer we get to polling day , the more people are making their minds up and saying no thanks to the risks and costs of independence , and seeing the advantages that we can have			1
' we 're not complacent , but i 'm increasingly confident that we 're going to win this			0
' the findings come less than a week since yes @entity9 chiefs said a @entity28 poll for the @entity149 put them ' within touching distance of success on september 18 '			2
but the new figures suggest that even convincing every undecided voter to back separation may not be enough for victory			0
according to the poll , 49 per cent of men plan to vote no , with 41 per cent in favour of independence			2
among women , 52 per cent plan to reject separation – up six points in a week – and only 33 per cent said they will vote yes			0
younger voters aged 16 to 24 have also overwhelmingly swung behind the no camp , with 60 per cent now in favour of the @entity1 – up from 43 per cent last sunday			0
there are also more supporters of the @entity1 than opponents in most regions of @entity9 , including the key battleground of @entity112			0
labour leader @entity109 said he believes it has been ' laid bare ' that @entity5 ' has no plan ' asked about tuesday 's tv debate , @entity28 found that 65 per cent of the 1,010 respondents had watched the show			1
of those who saw the live clash , 53 per cent believe mr @entity11 won , compared to just 28 per cent who picked mr @entity5			1
even among those planning to vote @entity40 to independence , the first minister was seen as the victor by fewer than two - thirds of respondents			1
asked if the debate had changed how they intend to vote , 13 per cent said they were more likely to back separation , but 22 per cent said they were more likely to cross the ' no ' box on the ballot paper			0
mr @entity5 can take some comfort in his personal ratings figures , with 39 per cent of @entity9 satisfied with the way he is doing his job as first minister , compared to just 19 per cent who are satisfied with @entity200 's job as prime minister			1
mr @entity5 was also considered the best representative for @entity203 by 32 per cent of voters , with only 23 per cent picking his deputy @entity82			0
a @entity203 spokesman said : ' the poll shows most @entity9 agree with us that the @entity210 parties are bluffing on currency - and a majority want an independent @entity9 to keep the pound , which is exactly what will happen			1
' the polls will always fluctuate , but what they all show is that support for @entity40 is well above 40 per cent - and we are very confident our positive message that a @entity40 vote is @entity9 's one opportunity to protect the @entity222 , create more jobs here and guarantee that @entity9 no longer gets landed with @entity225 governments we reject , will win a majority on september 18			2
