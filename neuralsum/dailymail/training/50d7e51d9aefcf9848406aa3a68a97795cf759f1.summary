by @entity0 published : 05:30 est , 12 march 2014 updated : 10:08 est , 12 march 2014 a mother - of - two discovered she had cancer after her stomach swelled so much she looked nine months pregnant			1
@entity5 , 47 , had a 13lb tumour removed from her lower abdomen in a dangerous surgical procedure which doctors feared would kill her			1
mrs @entity5 , who has subsequently battled breast cancer , says the tumour was only discovered after she had colonic irrigation in the hope of reducing bloating so she could fit into her wedding dress			1
@entity5 ( right , pictured recently ) was diagnosed with ovarian cancer after her stomach swelled so much she looked nine months pregnant ( left )			1
she also suffered stomach pain , constipation and a feeling of fullness mrs @entity5 , from @entity21 , in @entity22 , said : ‘ my wedding was just a few months away and my tummy was so huge at the dress fitting that i was worried i would n't fit into it			1
‘ aside from the swelling i 'd had problems for a year , such a constipation , pain , a feeling of fullness and gynaecological problems			1
in the back of my mind i had wondered whether anything was seriously wrong but i assumed i had simply put on weight or had @entity38			1
‘ the first irrigation did n't reduce the swelling as much as i wanted , so i went back for a second session			1
that 's when technicians asked me to go and see a doctor urgently			1
’ she attended the @entity46 department at @entity47 where medics were initially baffled			0
she said : ‘ they asked me whether i was pregnant			0
by that time , i looked nine months gone			0
i knew i was n't because i 'd arranged to be sterilised after having my son			0
‘ then they thought it was a cyst			0
i was referred to @entity54 ’s hospital in @entity55 where a consultant told me i had ovarian cancer			1
the tumour was growing at a fast rate			0
’ three months before her wedding , mrs @entity5 ( pictured with her father , @entity61 , and son , @entity63 ) was told she needed risky life - saving surgery			1
doctors suggested that she cancel her wedding but she refused mrs @entity5 ( pictured with her father , @entity61 ) says that despite her swollen stomach ( pictured ) she assumed she either had @entity38 or that she had just put on some weight the emergency surgery , which took place in may 2009 , required surgeons to cut from mrs @entity5 's breast bone to just above her waist			1
the doctors had little idea about what they would find inside			0
in the end , mrs @entity5 had to have parts of her bowel and bladder removed , and she also underwent a full hysterectomy			1
ovarian cancer affects more than 6,500 women in the @entity86 each year			1
it is the fifth most common cancer among women			2
it is most common in women who have had the menopause but it can affect women of any age			0
the symptoms are difficult to recognise , especially in the early stages of the disease , as they can be very similar to those of other , less serious , conditions			0
the most common early symptoms are persistent bloating , pelvic or abdominal pain , difficulty eating and nausea			1
other symptoms can include back pain and needing to pass urine more frequently			2
source : @entity110 she said : ‘ they did n't know what the tumour was attached to or what it was made of			0
they told me to cancel my wedding , which was just three months away			2
i was adamant that i did n't - the wedding had to go ahead			1
‘ but they were keen to make the point that the situation was very serious			0
my gp sat me down and gently told me to get my affairs in order			0
’ mrs @entity5 , a @entity126 project manager , said breaking the news to her fiancé @entity128 , 46 , who owns a floor cleaning company , and her children @entity63 , 16 , and @entity131 , 18 , was an emotional experience			1
she said : ‘ it 's not a conversation you can ever imagine having			0
‘ i threw a big barbeque for all my friends and family			0
i took each of my friends aside for one - to - one conversations and told them what was happening			2
there were quite a few tears			0
‘ the surgery was five days later			2
i remember saying goodbye to @entity128 as i was wheeled down to the operating theatre			0
i wondered whether i would ever see him again			0
’ but despite her worst fears , mrs @entity5 woke up after the surgery , her body free of the 13lb tumour			1
she said : ‘ i phoned everyone from the recovery ward			0
it felt amazing to be alive			2
’ on september 4 2009 mrs @entity5 was helped to walk down the aisle by her father and son			2
during surgery mrs @entity5 had a 13lb tumour removed as well as part of her stomach , bowel and bladder			1
she also had a full hysterectomy and doctors said she was lucky to survive the operation she said : ‘ @entity128 made a speech thanking the surgeons , without whom i would n't have been there			2
it was the most wonderful , emotional , beautiful day			0
’ then , in december 2012 , after suffering a range of mysterious symptoms , she was diagnosed with breast cancer			1
she said : ‘ i wondered whether i was going through the menopause			0
my gp had told me that because i 'd had the full hysterectomy , i could experience those kinds of symptoms			2
‘ i had an unusual rash on my nipple and marks on the underside of my breast			2
i tried to put it out of mind at first but i decided to get it checked out during breast cancer awareness week			1
’ to combat the cancer mrs @entity5 had a mastectomy on her right side			1
she also had lymph nodes , nerves in her right arm and muscular tissue from her back removed			0
mrs @entity5 ( pictured with husband , @entity128 , son @entity63 , 16 , and daughter , @entity131 , 18 ) has written a blog about her experiences			2

she is also due to have reconstructive surgery she underwent a year of chemotherapy and radiotherapy before she was declared cancer - free in january 2014			1

‘ i 've had to be strong			0
i 've had to fight for the sake of my family			0
but i 've been blessed to have such wonderful support , especially from @entity128 , who has laughed with me through the darkest moments			0
