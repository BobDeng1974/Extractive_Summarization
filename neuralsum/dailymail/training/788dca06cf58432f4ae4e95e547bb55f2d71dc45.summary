by @entity0 the future of year - round farming could lie not in farms , but in huge warehouses lit with an eerie pink light , researchers have claimed			1
researchers have found that tomatoes grown around led lights in the winter can significantly reduce greenhouse energy costs without sacrificing yield - and say the technique could change the way farming works			1
one @entity16 firm is already experimenting with a giant warehouse in @entity18 , which hides a vast hi - tech pink growing area where 2.2 million plants will only see sunlight at the end of their life			1
a giant ' pinkhouse ' at @entity25 in @entity26 , @entity18 , which grows 2.2 million plants under the glow of blue and red @entity28 - and could become the future of urban farming the giant warehouse which houses the ' undercover farm ' the ' pink ' lights give plants only the wavelengths of light they need the most - blue and red			1
plant 's photosynthesis machinery is tuned to absorb red and blue light most efficiently , so the researchers have developed systems to only supply this wavelength , lowering the cost of lighting systems needed			1
the systems allow plants to grow perfectly normally without the need for real sunlight			2
@entity25 , a @entity18 firm , is already growing a tobacco - like plant to make new drugs and vaccines using the system			2
the 150,000 - square - foot ' plant factory ' is completely closed off from the outside world , and is home to 2.2 million plants , stacked 50 feet high under the glow of blue and red leds			1
' a photon is a terrible thing to waste , ' @entity61 told @entity64			0
' so we developed these lights to correctly match the photosynthesis needs of our plants			2
' we get almost 20 percent faster growth rate and save a lot energy			0
' researchers at @entity72 say the technique could be used for producing crops all year - round			1
@entity75 , a professor of horticulture , said the average tomato is shipped about 1,500 miles from warmer climates where they are grown to cooler climates that can not produce the fruit cost - effectively in the winter			2
he believes that led lights could mean growing all year round - and help local farmers compete			1
' the @entity16 still imports one - third of its tomatoes from @entity86 and @entity87 , as well as other countries , ' @entity75 said			2
' it makes it really hard for the greenhouse industry to grow tomatoes well in the offseason			0
@entity75 , from left , and @entity96 harvest tomatoes grown around red and blue led lights , which use far less energy than traditional high - pressure sodium lamps in greenhouses ' we 're trying to change that and make it affordable , ' @entity75 said			1
' this technology could allow @entity16 growers to create local jobs that shrink carbon footprints and produce better - tasting tomatoes			2
' @entity75 and doctoral student @entity109 experimented with light - emitting diodes , which are cooler and require far less energy than traditional high - pressure sodium lamps used in greenhouses			0
they got the same yield - size and number of fruit - with high - pressure sodium lamps and led towers , but the @entity28 used about 25 percent of the energy of traditional @entity121 scientists think that the method could have other advantages because the cooler leds can be placed much closer and along the sides of plants , lighting not only the top , but also the underside			1
future studies include comparing led - lit tomatoes with traditionally grown tomatoes for flavor			0
crops could soon be grown in greenhouses the size of skyscrapers in city centres across the country , it has been claimed			0
@entity140 and other food producers are investigating building ‘ plantscrapers ’ , which could accommodate hundreds of storeys worth of crops , in a bid to make farming more economical , sustainable and meet increasing demand			0
the ‘ vertical farms ’ would use an innovative feeding system which nourishes plants with enriched water , therefore cancelling out the need for soil – and the need for food to be grown and harvested in the countryside			0
how the ' plantscraper ' works because the climate inside them can be controlled , it is claimed the farms will dramatically increase crop yields because growing can occur all year round , while the plants would be under cover , so pesticides would not need to be used			1
some supermarket foods such as tomatoes and strawberries are already grown on farms using a primitive form of the so - called hydroponic system			0
now there are sophisticated plantscrapers planned or under construction in @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity179 and @entity180 in the @entity16 in @entity186 , @entity176 , a 54 - metre - high structure ( just over half the height of @entity183 – home of @entity183 – in @entity185 ) is being built by @entity176 firm @entity187			0
by 2014 , the structure will produce a range of leafy green vegetables , including salad leaves , spinach and mustard greens			0

researchers claim *artificial* lighting in warehouses could produce year - round growing
experiments being *carried* out using ' pink ' lights - actually a *mix* of blue and red @entity28
could be used to grow food all year round in giant warehouses *dubbed* ' pinkhouses '
