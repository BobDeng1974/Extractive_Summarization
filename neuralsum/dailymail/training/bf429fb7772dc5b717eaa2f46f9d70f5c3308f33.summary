remember that ? in gloomy winter months it ’s not just the warmth of the sun ’s rays you miss — you may also suffer lower levels of vitamin d , the sunshine vitamin			1
@entity10 is important for bone health — low levels are linked to fractures in adults and rickets in children			1
last week , a report by the @entity19 advisory body the @entity20 ( @entity20 ) , said more people should be given vitamin d tablets to counter a hidden epidemic of deficiency last week , a report by the @entity19 advisory body the @entity20 ( @entity20 ) , said more people should be given vitamin d tablets to counter a hidden epidemic of deficiency , with ten million people across @entity32 possibly affected			1
many thousands rely on supplements on prescription to ensure their levels are adequate			2
two years ago , the country ’s chief medical officers highlighted the need for vitamin d to be given to pregnant and breastfeeding women , children under five and the elderly			1
prescriptions soared as a result			2
however , @entity19 figures suggest the majority are being made up not with supplements licensed for medical use , but with food supplements that are not subjected to the same rigorous controls			1
indeed , 59 per cent of the 190,000 prescriptions issued in @entity32 every month for vitamin d are being made up with unlicensed products , according to @entity56 data for 2013			1
experts warn this could lead to patients getting the wrong dose — they may continue to be deficient or end up with too much vitamin d ( which leads to more calcium being absorbed from the gut , raising the risk of bone pain and kidney stones )			1
‘ it ’s outrageous that unlicensed vitamin d products are prescribed when licensed ones are available , ’ says dr @entity68 , a medical barrister and author of @entity70			1
‘ patients are being put at risk because there ’s no quality control			2
' with a licensed medicine , all its ingredients are known , have been tested and their safety at the stated dose confirmed			2
' but the content of unlicensed vitamin d products can vary hugely			1
’ some provide just 8 per cent of the stated dose , while others deliver 201 per cent , according to research published in @entity89 and aging in 2013			2
two years ago , the country ’s chief medical officers highlighted the need for vitamin d to be given to pregnant and breastfeeding women , children under five and the elderly			1
prescriptions soared as a result dr @entity68 , a former senior medical assessor with the @entity100 ( @entity100 ) , says a sample analysed for a different study found ‘ one product had only 14 per cent of the stated dose while another had 171 per cent ’			2
the number of vitamin d prescriptions has risen by 8,000 per cent since 2008			1
the problem is that prescribers have only six licensed medicines at their disposal and they do not come in every dosing permutation , says dr @entity112 , a clinical scientist and independent pharmaceutical consultant			0
licensed products come in doses of 800 , 3,200 , 10,000 and 25,000 international units			0
so when a gp writes a prescription for 1,000 units , that can be filled only by an unlicensed product			0
‘ if the pharmacist wants to dispense the licensed 800 unit medicine instead , he ’d have to ask the doctor if the prescription can be amended , ’ says dr @entity112			0
‘ @entity128 pharmacists are often too busy , so the unlicensed product is dispensed			0
’ he is also concerned that food supplement manufacturers can change the formulation of their product without notice			0
‘ it looks the same , but the ingredients may include something you ’re allergic to , ’ he says			0
the @entity139 says the situation is ‘ worrying ’			0
so why does it continue ? surprisingly , licensed medications are 50 per cent cheaper than unlicensed products , says dr @entity68			0
the problem is that while licensed medicines fall within the @entity100 ’s remit , food supplements do not			0
yet the @entity149 claims they are not its responsibility , either			0
a spokesman for the @entity100 said : ‘ @entity19 prescribing policy and practice is the responsibility of the @entity156			1
’ meanwhile , a spokesman for the @entity156 said : ‘ where there is no licensed product to meet a patient ’s needs , it is appropriate that prescribers can prescribe another product			0
’ in its first draft of its new guidance in may , @entity20 made no mention of the importance of filling vitamin d prescriptions with licensed medicines , a decision that was criticised by the @entity139			1
in its latest guidance , it urges the @entity156 to work with manufacturers to ensure licensed vitamin d products containing the recommended nutrient intake are available on prescription and supplements should undergo quality checks to ensure they contain the correct dose			2
however , there is no mention of who is responsible for carrying out such checks on the unlicensed ones on sale in the @entity186			0
the good news is that from next year two additional licensed products — one of 400 units and another of 25,000 units — will be available .			0
