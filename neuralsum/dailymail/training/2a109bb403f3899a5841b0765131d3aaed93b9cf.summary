sitting on the substitutes bench , his night already over , @entity0 must have watched @entity3 ’s late comeback and struggled to be phlegmatic			1
for 70 minutes the @entity3 centre forward - still awaiting his first goal for the club - had struggled in a team seemingly incapable of playing to his strengths			1
as a rather lame home defeat beckoned , though , things changed			0
@entity0 ( right ) started @entity3 's 2 - 1 @entity12 victory against @entity13 on tuesday night the @entity3 striker ( centre ) has failed to score for his new club since his £ 4million move from @entity18 first @entity19 crossed in front of the @entity21 for @entity22 to score from six yards and then a free - kick struck deep to the far post in injury time was headed in by central defender @entity26			1
undoubtedly , @entity0 would have fancied his chances with both			2
as he lies awake at night , that is what the 32 - year - old must wish for			0
a cross right on to his instep , a mistake from a goalkeeper			0
something he ca n’t miss. something to get him going			0
deep in his footballer ’s soul , though , @entity0 will know that his troubles at @entity40 are not down to misfortune			2
footballers always know and as such @entity0 will appreciate that his @entity3 career - such as it is - is stalling because of his own failings			1
@entity3 have a problem with goals in the @entity48 era , that much is clear			2
this time last season they had scored 28 times			0
already they are nine behind the rate			0
@entity0 ( right ) was given a rare oppotunity to impress boss @entity53 but failed to do so on tuesday @entity0 , though , looks like a centre forward simply waiting for things to happen			1
if he carries on in this vein , they simply will not			0
on tuesday night he was largely static , inert			0
he was tidy at times but he never bullied the @entity13 central defenders , never ran the channels , never stretched anyone			2
as a consequence , he had one shot , straight at the goalkeeper from 18 yards a minute before he was replaced by @entity22 with 11 left			1
keep in mind just how ordinary @entity3 ’s centre forwards have been this season and the @entity0 issue becomes clear			1
@entity22 had scored once before tuesday night			1
@entity68 has not played since september because of injury			0
yet @entity0 has been used so sparingly it is almost embarrassing			2
@entity0 ( right ) was replaced by @entity22 in the 79th minute at @entity40 on tuesday night in the @entity71 , he has started one game and lasted an hour			1
in six other league games he has been given a total of exactly 90 minutes as a substitute			0
for @entity76 , he has been used as a replacement three times , two of those appearances beginning in the 89th minute			0
the sympathetic may suggest @entity0 merely has n’t been given an opportunity			2
how can you score goals if you do n't play ? centre forwards depend on rhythm after all			0
however , the more cynical may say that @entity0 has shown nothing in training sessions to suggest he is ready for a place			2
to take that theory to its logical end is to wonder if @entity53 is beginning to wonder if the £ 4million he gave to @entity18 in the summer was a waste of money			1
other - more expensive - signings have struggled too this season			0
@entity22 ( centre ) equalised for @entity3 as they went on to beat @entity13 2 - 1 in their @entity12 tie @entity97 - who cost £ 20m - was wretched against @entity13 while @entity98 - £ 10m – has played only twice			1
however , @entity0 ’s story is more poignant because of its symbolism , the beetroot boy given a chance at his boyhood club			1
one feels that a goal may spur him but it looks some way distant at the moment and perhaps he should take something from the approach of @entity110			0
a player sold by @entity3 because he was n’t good enough , the midfielder always returns to @entity40 as though determined to prove the club were wrong			1
last season he scored here for @entity13 from 30 yards and again he was excellent on tuesday night			1
@entity110 arrives at @entity40 to enjoy himself			0
@entity13 midfielder @entity110 ( right ) impressed in midfield against his former club			2

@entity0 has failed to score for @entity3 since *joining* the club
@entity0 *joined* @entity3 for £ 4million from @entity18 this summer
he started @entity3 's 2 - 1 @entity121 *fourth* round win against @entity13
@entity0 was replaced by @entity22 - who equalised on tuesday
