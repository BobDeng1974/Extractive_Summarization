by @entity0 published : 09:27 est , 25 march 2013 updated : 12:34 est , 25 march 2013 big change is coming to the lives of the lesbian couple at the center of the fight for same - sex marriage in @entity7 no matter how the @entity8 decides their case			1
after 13 years of raising four boys together , @entity10 and @entity11 are about to be empty nesters			1
their youngest two children , 18 - year - old twins , will graduate from high school in june and head off to college a couple of months later			2
' we 'll see all the movies , get theater season tickets because you can actually go , ' ms @entity11 said in the living room of their bungalow in @entity27			2
life will not revolve quite so much around food , and the challenge of putting enough of it on the table to feed teenagers			0
ms @entity48 , 48 , and ms @entity11 , 50 , set aside their lunch hour on a recent busy friday to talk to @entity0 about their @entity8 case , the evolution of their activism for gay rights and family life			1
on tuesday , they plan to be in the courtroom when their lawyer , @entity58 , tries to persuade the justices to strike down @entity7 's voter - approved ban on same - sex marriages and to declare that gay couples can marry nationwide			1
supporters of @entity7 's @entity42 , represented by lawyer @entity65 , argue that the court should not override the democratic process and impose a judicial solution that would redefine marriage in the 40 states that do not allow same - sex couples to wed. a second case , set for wednesday , involves the part of the federal @entity74 that prevents same - sex couples who are legally married from receiving a range of federal tax , pension and other benefits that otherwise are available to married people			1
the @entity8 hearing is the moment ms @entity48 and ms @entity11 , along with @entity81 and @entity82 of @entity83 , have been waiting for since they agreed four years ago to be the named plaintiffs and public faces of a well - funded , high - profile effort to challenge proposition 8 in the courts			1
' when you 've been out as long as i have been , 30 years , you ca n't dwell as much on what 's not working as maybe people think you do ' ' for the past four years , we 've lived our lives in this hurry - up - and - wait , pins - and - needles way , ' ms @entity48 said , recalling the crush of court deadlines and the seemingly endless wait for rulings from a federal district judge , the 9th @entity102 , also based there , and the @entity7 @entity8			1
ms @entity11 said mr @entity58 told them the case could take several years to resolve			1
' i thought , years ? ' she said			2
but the couple has been riding a marriage rollercoaster since 2003 , when ms @entity48 first asked ms @entity11 to marry her			2
they were planning a symbolic , but not legally recognized , wedding when @entity111 mayor @entity110 ordered city officials to issue marriage licenses to same - sex couples in 2004			1
so they were married , but only briefly			2
six months later , the @entity115 invalidated the same - sex unions			1
they went ahead with their plans anyway , but ' it was one of the sadder points of our wedding , ' ms @entity48 said			0
wedding bells ? the couple - who have been together for 13 years - plan to marry quickly if the @entity8 rules to legalize gay marriage less than four years later , however , the same state court overturned @entity7 's prohibition on same - sex unions			1
then , on the same day ms @entity48 and ms @entity11 rejoiced in president @entity133 's election , voters approved proposition 8 , undoing the court ruling and defining marriage as the union of a man and a woman			1
their lawsuit was filed six months later , after they went to the @entity142 courthouse for a marriage license and were predictably refused			0
' it 's such a weird road we 've been on , ' ms @entity48 said			2
all the more so because neither woman defined herself as a gay rights activist before the marriage fight			0
ms @entity48 , a native @entity7 from @entity149 , and ms @entity11 , who grew up in rural @entity150 , moved in together in 2000 , with ms @entity11 's two children from a heterosexual marriage and ms @entity48 's from a previous relationship			1
utterly conventional school meetings , soccer games and band practice - not the court case - have defined their lives together			2
as if to highlight this point , their son , @entity160 , briefly interrupted the interview to ask for a pair of headphones			0
ms @entity48 said the boys find her useful for two basic reasons these days			0
' do i have any headphones and do i have any money ? ' she said with a smile			0
ms @entity48 has spent her professional life advocating on behalf of early childhood education			0
ms @entity11 works for the county government 's public health department			1
' when you 've been out as long as i have been , 30 years , in order to feel ok every day and be optimistic and productive , you ca n't dwell as much on what 's not working as maybe people think you do , ' ms @entity48 said			1
even with @entity42 's passage , ms @entity48 and ms @entity11 said they were more focused on @entity133 's election			1
' i was all about health care reform and @entity183 is all about education reform and that was everything			0
gay rights , that would be great , but it 's a way off , ' ms @entity11 said			1
' we did the big celebration a long time ago			2
i hope this will be something a lot bigger than the two of us ' they do n't take the issue so lightly anymore			0
of course , they could not imagine a @entity202 president would endorse gay marriage along with voters in three states just last november			0
when @entity133 talked about equal rights for gay @entity202 in his inaugural speech in january , ms @entity48 said she felt as if ' we 've arrived at the adults ' table			0
we 're no longer at the kids ' table			0
' they will watch the argument in their case and then return home to wait for the decision , worried that it could come the same day as the boys ' high school graduations in mid-june			2
they know the court could uphold proposition 8 , which would almost certainly lead to an effort to repeal it by @entity7 voters			1
recent polls show support for repeal			0
any other outcome will allow them to get married			0
but ms @entity48 said they are hoping the court strikes ' a tone of more inclusion ' and issues the broadest possible ruling			0
they will get married quickly , in a small , private ceremony			0
' we did the big celebration a long time ago , ' ms @entity48 said			0
' i hope this will be something a lot bigger than the two of us			0

@entity10 and @entity11 agreed four years ago to be the named plaintiffs and public faces of the high - profile effort to overturn the law
the @entity8 will decide tuesday whether to strike down @entity7 's voter - approved ban on same - sex marriages
a second case on wednesday will look at the part of the @entity74 that prevents same - sex couples who are legally married from receiving benefits otherwise available to married people
