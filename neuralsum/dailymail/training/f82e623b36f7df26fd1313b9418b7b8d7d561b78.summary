a @entity1 film maker who ' married ' a tribal warrior says she agreed to it to highlight the oil giants destroying his @entity6 home			1
@entity8 underwent the symbolic ritual aged just 21 after she left @entity10 to spend two weeks with the @entity12 tribe , which has 3,000 members in the mineral - rich @entity15 rainforest			1
despite historically tense relations with outsiders dating to the 1950s , when five @entity17 missionaries who tried to infiltrate the tribe were killed , she claimed she was welcomed with open arms			1
she said : ' i thought , " i ca n't get naked , this is being filmed " , and for a split second i thought about running away ' she learned how to weave with grasses and hunt with a blowpipe , and by the end of the period she had ' married ' a warrior in his 50s named @entity44 - who spoke only the villagers ' own @entity12 dialect and a few words of @entity49			1
it was a symbolic gesture to spread the tribe 's plea for help against oil firms , not a legally binding marriage - but the language barrier meant things were not obvious at the start			1
' i was chosen by the elders and i had no idea what was going to happen to me , ' she said			0
' i was called into a hut and everyone inside was naked			2
i was told they were making me their traditional clothes , which is a piece of string made of plant fibres worn around the waist – not even a thong			0
' i thought , " i ca n't get naked , this is being filmed " , and for a split second i thought about running away , but i wanted to fully embrace and understand their traditions			2
' one of the women pulled off my underwear , and i gave in from there			2
the elder leader was chanting and the women were making chicha , their home - brewed beverage			2
learning : although the tribe faces threats from the outside world , ms @entity8 said she was surprised at the open welcome she received , and she was taught how to do traditional weaving by the women in the tribe explorer : ms @entity8 made her experiences into a documentary film which was screened at @entity91 last year ' they were happy that i was totally naked and started to make a crown for me out of macaw feathers			1
' i was told , " they are going to make you queen "			2
i was surrounded by the women and warriors chanting and dancing in the hut - i thought i was being initiated			2
' they gave me the chicha drink and the name @entity104 , which means the last name , before marrying me to my husband - to - be , the tribe 's most popular warrior , @entity44			1
' ' i had no idea what was going on			0
at first i thought it was just an initiation ceremony but then there was this guy next to me who had his arms around me			1
' she said she was shocked at first , but it was explained that she was not expected to have a sexual relationship with @entity26			0
instead the marriage was an honorary one to build trust with the tribe			2
' they knew why i was there and wanted to show me how they lived ' , she said			0
' @entity44 is a lovely guy and a strong hunter , which makes him very popular with the women			1
he was also very funny and curious about my life in @entity10			1
' we communicated through one of the other warriors who spoke @entity134 to my cameraman			0
he asked all about my parents , my family and friends			0
' ms @entity8 was one of many ' eco-tourists ' and documentary makers hosted by the tribe over the years , but insisted the wedding ceremony was a rare occurrence			1
however , she was not the only @entity145 who ginkto ' married '			0
two years earlier the same tribal warrior ' wed ' @entity147 , a single mother from @entity148 who went to live briefly in the village			1
in that case , however , it was for a @entity153 documentary specifically about marriage			0
' we 're now friends ' , said ms @entity156			0
' it 's led to quite a lot of jokes '			0
adventure : the young explorer said she had wanted to visit the tribes of the @entity6 since the age of nine boat : the journey to the @entity169 people 's village took two days by boat from the nearest town now 26 , ms @entity8 made her experiences into a half - hour documentary , @entity174 , which was shown at the @entity175 last year			1
since then it has been accepted at the @entity177 , and this year ms @entity8 was made a fellow of the @entity178			1
she was finishing a film degree at @entity180 in @entity181 when she set off on her self - funded trip in 2010 to @entity15 's @entity183 , fulfilling a dream which began when she was nine			1
' by the time i was in film school i felt i was n't really being prepared for the real world , ' she said			0
' i wanted to do something with my life and for my future so i decided to literally follow my dream			0
' i quit my job , used all my savings , hired a cinematographer from @entity196 and a sound guy from @entity198			1
i did some research about this tribe in the @entity6 and just went there			2
' she won the 5,800 - mile air fare as one of ten finalists in the national @entity206 - the only woman that year			0
other funds came from private investors before the trip			0
once in @entity15 she met her colleagues , @entity1 sound engineer @entity212 and @entity17 cinematographer @entity213 , and taught @entity214 to children in the @entity216 before venturing deeper into the jungle			1
hitches : she was taught how to hunt , and nature fought back - her sound engineer was airlifted to hospital clip : a still from the documentary			0
communication was difficult at times , as the tribe speaks its own dialect despite not being able to swim , she travelled by boat for two days from the town of @entity231 through piranha and alligator infested waters , stopping overnight at a beach to fish for dinner			2
during the journey she and her companions met representatives from the tribe , who had been contacted by outsiders before and have their own reserve near the national park agreed with @entity15 's authorities			1
once in the village of @entity247 it was not plain sailing - mr @entity212 had to be airlifted to hospital when a cut to his arm became infected , and she was bitten by parasites and developed a stomach infection - but she said the villagers were keen to tell her about their plight at the hand of oil companies			1
the @entity169 people live on top of some of @entity261 's richest oil reserves , and campaigners say the invasion of outsiders has increased tension in their ancestral land			0
@entity267 began in 1956 , when five evangelical missionaries from the @entity17 were killed after trying to convert @entity270 villagers to @entity271 in a widely - publicised case			0
it is said to have been the first documented time the tribe was contacted by the outside world			0
nowadays contact with outsiders is more common - some tribe members have taken to wearing western clothing - but is still not always for the right reasons			2
friends abroad : ms @entity8 with tribe members including her ' husband ' @entity44			1
contact with outsiders was more common in recent decades			0
some wear @entity288 clothes - though others remain utterly uncontacted friends at home : ms @entity8 , second from left , with friends at a film meet - up in @entity10 after her return as well as oil there are mineral reserves beneath the rainforest and it is a target for illegal loggers			1
several roads have been built into @entity12 territory			2
tribe members told a @entity153 documentary in 2011 that they could no longer grow food on river banks because they feared contamination would wash downstream			2
and last year the charity @entity309 , which campaigns for indigenous people 's rights , said two @entity12 members were killed by fellow tribespeople as competition for land increased			1
tribal leader @entity316 said at the time : ' this is not a tourist zone			0
this is an area in a state of red alert			0
' we ’re asking the authorities to act immediately on our request to provide logistical support to protect our uncontacted @entity328 brothers			0
' ms @entity8 said she still keeps occasional contact with the tribe members over e-mail and even on @entity332 , when they make the rare trip to the nearest town			1
' i would love to go back to see them all again , ' she said .			0

@entity8 quit her job in @entity10 aged 21 to study @entity12 tribe
it has 3,000 members in part of @entity15 jungle *threatened* by oil firms
she spent just two weeks in village but was welcomed with open arms
naked initiation saw women make her a crown from macaw feathers
she was then surprised to discover it was a full ' wedding ceremony '
to her relief the union with warrior @entity44 , in his 50s , was only symbolic
