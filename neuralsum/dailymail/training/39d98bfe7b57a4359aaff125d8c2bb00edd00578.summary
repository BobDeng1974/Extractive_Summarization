there was no better place than the @entity2 for @entity3 to show he really can overcome the problems that threatened to nip his @entity7 career in the bud			1
it was here in @entity11 last year that @entity3 was sent home from an @entity14 tour where he failed to make a single international appearance and was branded ‘ unselectable ’ by @entity7 after his action had virtually fallen apart			1
the road back has been long and tough for a man who was once among the most promising and potent fast bowlers in the world — but this was the day when he took giant strides towards re-igniting his career			0
@entity7 's @entity3 acknowledges the @entity2 crowd after taking five wickets for 33 runs against @entity26 @entity3 celebrates with @entity27 and @entity28 after taking the wicket of @entity30 @entity27 marks his half - century as @entity7 successfully chased down the 154 needed to beat @entity26 @entity7 's @entity27 sent @entity32 sprawling as @entity7 began their run chase of 154 to win @entity7 's @entity34 plays a shot during his team 's run chase in the latest tri-series match @entity27 touches the flag of @entity40 as he walks out at the start of @entity7 's innings @entity27 guides a shot beyond wicketkeeper @entity44 as @entity7 chased down @entity26 's total @entity3 was outstanding as @entity7 brushed @entity26 aside with a nine - wicket victory on tuesday			1
they took a significant step towards the tri-series final and , crucially , showed ahead of the @entity49 that they can compete against one of the one - day powerhouses			1
this does not suddenly make @entity7 @entity49 contenders but a thumping win over the defending champions , so emphatic it gained them a bonus point , was a welcome step forward for a team still with much to prove			1
at the centre of it was @entity3 , who took his first five - wicket haul in one - day internationals , including the key scalps of @entity64 and @entity44			2
and to think he was so ineffective against @entity65 in @entity66 and might well have missed out had illness not stopped @entity68 from playing			2
only two days ago @entity3 looked a disconsolate figure as he bowled in an empty net at practice , occasionally stopping for some pep talks with guest motivator @entity73 , while the other bowlers went through their paces			2
@entity68 ’s misfortune was @entity3 ’s gain but it would be wrong to suggest he is back to his very best			2
his old habit of smashing his right knee into the stumps in his delivery stride briefly resurfaced			0
only two years ago in @entity83 he was being talked of as the first @entity7 bowler to break the 100mph mark , but here his bowling was almost 20mph below that			0
@entity88 celebrates after bowling @entity26 's @entity89 for five runs @entity26 's @entity44 edges a @entity3 delivery to @entity92 ( left ) after making 34 runs the crowd watches with baited breath as @entity96 takes the catch from @entity98 for one run @entity101 's figures of 5 - 33 are the second - best by an @entity7 bowler in an odi in @entity65			1
the best - @entity104 ' 6 - 45 in 2011 - also came at the @entity2			0
yet he was accurate and hit the right lengths to prove almost unplayable for an @entity107 line - up who looked as though @entity110 conditions were completely alien to them — rather than a side who played a test at the @entity2 only last month			0
@entity3 said : ‘ there have been a few bad memories knocking around at places we have been to since we came back here but hopefully this will help to re-align me			0
i ’m enjoying being in @entity65 this time			0
‘ a lot ’s happened in the last 12 months			0
it ’s pretty much a year to the day since i went home from @entity65			2
but that corner ’s been turned and all that stuff ’s in the past			0
i want to look forward and i think i ’m getting there			0
i might have another couple of miles per hour in the tank but that should come with confidence			0
i hope to get into my stride as the tour goes on			0
’ @entity88 reaches but ca n't take a catch off @entity44 as @entity26 gained a reprieve @entity3 celebrates with his team - mates after taking the wicket of @entity136 ( right ) @entity136 was bowled first ball by @entity3 as @entity7 finished off the @entity107 order for 153 runs @entity28 was unable to claim a wicket despite plenty of hard toil during his seven overs he paid tribute to @entity73 , who clearly relished being involved again and could be seen with his two boys milling around the outfield seeking autographs after the game			1
‘ i have never really spoken to @entity73 about cricket before and it was great to have him at the nets , ’ said @entity3			0
‘ to tap into his knowledge and get the perspective of someone outside the bubble was refreshing			0
’ @entity88 , back for his first international appearance since last summer , set the tone and emphasised how important he will be to @entity7 ’s @entity49 hopes with a probing spell of new - ball swing bowling			1
@entity26 's @entity160 walks after being caught by @entity92 off the bowling of @entity88 for one @entity3 successfully appeals for the wicket of @entity164 , who had made 23 runs @entity3 ( second left ) celebrates the wicket of @entity30 , caught by @entity34 ( second right ) @entity167 is stumped by @entity92 off the bowling of @entity96 for just one run then @entity3 took over , taking three of the four @entity107 wickets to fall in 24 balls and adding two more in successive deliveries as @entity7 looked a potent force , possibly for the first time in the 50 - over game since they lost the @entity178 final to @entity26 almost two years ago			1
@entity3 finished with five for 33 and would have had a sixth wicket had @entity180 detected a gloved catch from @entity32 while @entity88 , easing his way back from a knee injury , was superb in taking four for 18			1
@entity7 were superior in every department , @entity184 ’s excellent day in the field ending with an outstanding outfield catch that was then surpassed by an even better one from @entity96			2
once @entity26 had tumbled out for 153 , @entity7 romped home with a stonking 135 balls and nine wickets in hand			1
( @entity193 ) @entity28 , @entity34 , @entity27 , @entity194 and @entity3 celebrate the wicket of @entity30 @entity26 opener @entity30 bats during @entity198 one day international in @entity11 @entity64 signs autographs for delighted fans at the @entity2 in @entity11 during the one - day international @entity27 may have been out first ball in @entity66 but here he was more like the man who scored 187 against a @entity203 in @entity204 last week			1
he benefited from a pop - gun attack to reach 88 in an unbeaten partnership of 131 with @entity34			2
@entity26 , it must be said , were awful , with @entity44 having one of his baffling days as captain , relying far too heavily on the innocuous medium - pace of @entity32 rather than throwing his fastest bowler @entity211 at @entity7			1
@entity26 need to win their last two games to have any chance of reaching the final , while @entity7 travel to @entity217 in good heart to play on friday against an @entity110 side missing @entity220 , @entity221 and @entity222			1
it is early days , but @entity7 can take considerable encouragement from this .			0
