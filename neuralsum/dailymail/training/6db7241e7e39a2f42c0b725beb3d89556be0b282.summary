doctors later found that @entity8 , 32 , from @entity9 , was in fact suffering from a rare , incurable disease called @entity12 ( @entity12 ) which causes her soft tissues to turn into solid bone			1
after being fitted with her new robotic arm at the @entity17 for @entity18 at risk in @entity20 last week , she told @entity21 : ' i keep looking down and seeing two hands and it 's just mind - blowing			2
' overwhelming feeling : @entity8 whose right arm was amputated from the shoulder down when she was three years old after being misdiagnosed with cancer has been fitted with a bionic limb the prosthesis works through sensors placed on ms @entity8 's right shoulder			1
these detect minute electrical charges in her muscles and trigger small motors in the battery - powered arm to move			2
this means ms @entity8 can now multi-task			1
in front of a film crew she demonstrated how she can now use her cell phone and hold a drink at the same time			2
' i put a cookie in there and just go for it , ' ms @entity8 later said while popping a biscuit into her mouth			1
brave : ms @entity8 , ( right ) is slowly losing her ability to move thanks to a disease disease called @entity12 ( @entity12 ) which causes her soft tissues to turn into solid bone lucky : ms @entity8 , who has already lost an arm to the condition , says she is happy her jaw has n't locked ms @entity8 is one of an estimated 700 people worldwide with @entity12 ( @entity12 ) , a disease sometimes known as ' stone man syndrome ' because its devastating effects can leave sufferers completely immobilised , like living statues			1

' my condition has made me who i am - an optimistic person with an inner strength and determination to succeed ' ' if i want to do something , then i normally find a way to do it			0
i do n't know how much longer i will have movement in my body , so i want to experience as much as i can now			0
' in other cases of @entity12 people have frozen solid , their jaws locking shut			1
they ca n't move and have to talk through their teeth long before they get to my age			2
so i actually feel extremely lucky			0
' the condition arises from a mutation of the body 's repair mechanism which causes muscles , tendons and ligaments to convert to bone material when damaged			2
ms @entity8 , , whose mother @entity92 emigrated to @entity9 from the @entity93 before she was born , was diagnosed with the condition when she was three years old - six months after her right arm was amputated by surgeons who wrongly suspected she had cancer			1
childhood : ms @entity8 , pictured with her mother @entity92 , was initially diagnosed with cancer at the age of three ambassador : she now hopes to raise awareness of her condition and met the @entity105 in 2007 ' during my childhood my mobility was fine , because i was still young , ' she added			1
' but i was quite unhappy			0
i felt very different from the other children at school , and i did n't have many friends			0
i was quite shy and kept myself to myself			0
it was n't much of a life			0
' her symptoms first began to show when she was a teenager , with gradual muscle stiffening accelerating as she grew older			2
' i began to feel my body stiffen gradually			0
i knew i was finally facing the onset of the condition , ' she remembers			0
' i 'd been told what was going to happen , and feeling the first symptoms made me want to experience everything life had to offer - before it was too late			0
' she married @entity127 , 31 , a man she met online , but the pair divorced in 2005 after three years of marriage			0

video source @entity134 ' walking down the aisle , with full use of my limbs , was one of the happiest days of my life , and no one can take that memory away from me			0
' despite her happy memories , in may 2006 , ms @entity8 's life took a turn for the worse after she was involved in a serious car crash			1
she escaped without any broken bones but her right leg took a heavy impact			0
' my doctor warned me that just the slightest bump could trigger the @entity12 to take hold			1
after the smash i fully expected my leg to freeze up permanently , ' ms @entity8 said			1
proud : ms @entity8 wants to do as much as she possibly can before being left immobile ' one of my worst fears was that my body would fuse upright , meaning i 'd never be able to sit again			1
' when my leg locked in a standing position i was sure i was facing a worst - case scenario			0
luckily when the swelling went down i was able to bend the leg slightly			0
' i spent a lot of time sitting in the hope it would fuse in that position			0
at least then i could sit in a wheelchair and be wheeled around			0
' her leg locked into a bent position permanently in may 2007 , and ms @entity8 was fitted with a special platform shoe to help her maintain as much mobility as possible			1
since the setback , ms @entity8 has been determined to do more with her life and so far , has learned to surf and completed a five kilometre course in a specially - adapted wheelchair in august last year			1
she has also become a full - time ambassador for amputees and families affected by the @entity12 and in december she is going on a @entity182 cruise with 100 friends who are amputees			2
' i 've been blessed to meet so many truly amazing people , especially the @entity105 - that was a real honour , ' said @entity8 of the religious leader , whom she met in 2007			1
' i feel so humbled that so many people have taken an interest , and hopefully found some inspiration , in my life			2
' there 's no known cure for @entity12 , but in 2006 , a team at the @entity195 isolated the gene responsible for the disease			2
researchers are now searching for a cure .			0

@entity8 , 32 , was misdiagnosed with cancer at the age of three but was later found to be suffering from @entity12
