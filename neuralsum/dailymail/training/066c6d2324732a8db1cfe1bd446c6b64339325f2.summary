@entity0 edged out @entity1 on penalties in a dramatic last - 16 @entity4 game			1
there was nothing to separate the sides after 120 minutes of play , but @entity9 held their nerve to win the tie in a dramatic shootout			1
but how did the players get on individually ? @entity15 gives his ratings : @entity0 @entity17 : 7 not much chance of stopping @entity1 ’s goal but a great second half save to keep @entity0 in the game			1
beaten : @entity17 lays forlorn as @entity23 scores for @entity1 @entity24 : 5 tested @entity25 with a vicious shot and covered the hard yards but not his best game			1
@entity29 : 7 got the vital flick - on for @entity9 ’s goal and a strong defensive display			1
@entity9 : 7 hugely important goal and what a celebration and stood firm in central defence			2
@entity36 : @entity9 celebrating his opening goal for @entity0 @entity38 : 6 at times lacked positional discipline but a solid performance all the same			1
@entity42 : 6 wasted no time making his presence felt with a late challenge on @entity45 but ran himself into the ground before limping off			2
@entity47 : 6 a commanding presence in midfield and protector of the back - four , often sitting as deep as the centre - halves			0
enforcer : @entity47 challenging @entity53 in midfield @entity54 : 6 not his best performance at this tournament			0
kept pretty quiet by strong @entity57 defending			0
@entity58 : 7 showed explosive pace on the ball and some marvellous skill – not to mention bags of energy - but did n’t take his chances this time			1
poster boy : @entity58 fighting for the ball with @entity1 defender @entity67 hulk : 6 dreadful mistake for @entity1 ’s equaliser and a booking for that controversial disallowed goal			1
but terrific too at times			0
@entity73 : 5 missed what chances came to him and replaced midway through the second half by @entity76			0
disappointing : @entity73 had a disappointing game before being subbed off @entity1 @entity25 : 7 some mad moments but did his job , including some quite stunning saves			2
@entity82 : 6 looked stretched at times but a courageous display by the @entity85 man			0
rock : @entity1 defender @entity82 was excellent at the back @entity87 : 6 did well , in partnership with @entity67 , to marshall @entity54			2
@entity89 : 6 picked up a booking that meant a suspension and struggled at times with @entity94 ’s strength and power			1
@entity67 : 6 like @entity29 did a good job making like difficult for @entity0 as a right - sided wing - back			1
battler : @entity67 challenging for the ball with @entity0 's @entity58 @entity100 : 6 booked and therefore also knew he would be out of the next game			1
@entity103 : 6 coped well in the midfield battle zone against quality opposition			0
@entity53 : 7 what a good player the @entity107 man is			0
seemingly can play anywhere too			0
acrobatic : @entity1 and @entity107 midfielder @entity53 goes for a fly kick @entity45 : 6 crunching tackle on @entity58 in the opening exchanges			1
@entity113 : 7 his ball for the equaliser was superb and defended from the front			0
@entity23 : 8 marvellous goal			2
his 10th in 14 international matches			0
if @entity121 can get him they really should			0
@entity123 : @entity23 celebrates his opener			2

@entity0 beat @entity1 on penalties after 1 - 1 draw after extra time
@entity9 opens the scoring before @entity23 levels for @entity1

@entity23 and @entity89 among those to fail for @entity1
