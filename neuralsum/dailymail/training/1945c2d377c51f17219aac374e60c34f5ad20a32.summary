by @entity0 published : 20:48 est , 20 may 2013 updated : 11:50 est , 21 may 2013 it was a film that came to symbolise the second intifada as @entity5 - @entity4 tensions exploded into war			1
but iconic footage of a 12 - year - old @entity5 boy being shot dead during a gunfight between @entity4 and @entity5 soldiers has been branded a fake and a ' blood libel ' - 13 years after it shocked the world			1
a new @entity4 report into @entity16 's death in the @entity17 claims the images may have been staged by @entity19 , the @entity20 television station that broke the story in 2000			1
the claims , which will reignite tensions in an already highly - volatile region , have caused such outrage in @entity17 that @entity16 's father himself has offered to exhume his son 's body so an international inspection can be carried out			1
the father is seen gesturing frantically to try to stop the shooting as the boy screams in terror			2
the camera then cuts to a shot of the motionless boy slumped in his father 's lap. a @entity20 tv report blamed @entity4 troops for killing the boy which @entity4 has long disputed			1
images of @entity16 taken from the film were reproduced on stamps , and on murals painted across the @entity60 ; schools and streets were named after him ; and he became viewed as a martyr in @entity17			2
the @entity19 television network report , which aired days after the @entity5 uprising erupted , directly blamed @entity16 's death on @entity4 forces			1
but presenting the report yesterday , @entity4 's minister for strategic affairs @entity70 branded the programme ' utterly baseless ' and a ' modern - day blood libel against the state of @entity4			1
' bizarrely , the @entity4 @entity76 ( @entity76 ) even admitted killing the boy by accident at first , but quickly backtracked claiming he was in fact slain by @entity5 friendly fire			2
@entity4 later blamed the ' mistake ' on the ' fog of war ' , claiming it was made before all the evidence was gathered			1
the father is seen gesturing frantically to try to stop the shooting as the boy screams in terror unforgettable : the camera cuts to a shot of the motionless child slumped in his father 's lap @entity4 now says @entity20 2 's claim that @entity4 forces killed the boy is misleading , provides no evidence and is part of a smear campaign against the jewish state			1
the 44 - page report of its investigation , ordered last year by @entity4 's current defence minister @entity104 , says it also ' served as an inspiration and justification for terrorism , antisemitism and the delegitimising of @entity4 '			1
it said @entity20 2 failed to broadcast peripheral footage , not aired in the original programme , in which the boy ' is seen to be alive ' and ' moved his arm and turned his head ' , adding that there was no evidence the boy was shot by @entity4 troops or that he was even killed at all			1
proof of this , it said , was that there were no blood marks on the scene or bullet wounds in the alleged victims			0
remembering : @entity128 , sister of @entity16 poses with a picture of her sibling in @entity132 in the @entity17 ' it is important to focus on this incident , which has slandered @entity4 's reputation , ' @entity4 prime minister @entity133 said at a ceremony where the report was delivered to him , branding it a ' manifestation of of the ongoing , mendacious campaign to deligitimise @entity4 '			1
the second @entity5 intifada or uprising broke out at the end of september 2000 and is named after the @entity145 mosque complex where the violence @entity146 that years of the negotiation had failed to deliver a @entity5 state were intensified by the collapse of the @entity152 summit in july @entity153 , then the leader of @entity4 's opposition , paid a visit to the site in @entity145 known to @entity158 as @entity159 , and to @entity160 as @entity159 , which houses the @entity161 - and frustration boiled over into violence			1
in one of the enduring images of the conflict 12 - year - old @entity16 is killed during a gunbattle between @entity4 troops and @entity5 in the @entity17 , kindling @entity5 anger about the growing number of children killed by @entity4 forces			1
the army initially apologises , but later casts doubt on whether its forces killed the boy			0
the @entity178 agreement , brokered by president @entity179 , aims to end the upsurge in violence			0
it breaks down almost immediately			0
' this is a manifestation of the ongoing mendacious campaign to delegitimize @entity4			0
there is only one way to counter lies , and that is through the truth			0
' no autopsy was conducted , and the @entity4 investigation was based primarily on expert interviews and analysis of the raw film			2
however , @entity4 have at no point been able to offer a suggestion as to @entity32 's current whereabouts			2
the boy 's father , @entity33 , on monday said he is willing to have his son 's body exhumed so a pathological examination can be carried out , including dna testing to understand the true details of the boy 's death			1
' if he is still alive , who was the one who was shot in my arms and killed ? ' he asked			0
' the entire world saw how my beloved son was killed			0
' upon the report 's release , @entity20 2 immediately rejected its claims , calling for an independent inquiry			1
the programme 's reporter @entity216 said he was happy to take a polygraph test and would even be willing to help @entity32 's father exhume the body to ' clarify the circumstances of the incident			2
' @entity216 added that @entity4 investigators had at no point attempted to contact him or mr @entity16			2
@entity4 commentators who believe their country has been unfairly punished for the case nonetheless questioned the decision to conduct a new investigation , saying it was unlikely to sway already hardened opinions around the world			0
' on one hand , it 's better late than never			0
on the other , the damage has already been done , ' wrote @entity238 , a columnist for the @entity240 daily			0
@entity4 prime minister @entity133 said the incident had ' slandered @entity4 's reputation ' ' no report , and certainly not a report commissioned by the @entity4 government , is going to decrease the damage			1
' we have already been defeated in the battle between lies and the truth			0
' @entity251 , the @entity4 official who led the investigation , said it was imperative to set the record straight			0
' the entire idea that @entity4 is a child killer ... is first and foremost based on the @entity16 story , ' he told @entity258			2
@entity33 and his family clean the grave of their son @entity32 , at the @entity132 cemetery in the central of @entity17 it was said @entity32 died in the arms of his father after being caught in crossfire between @entity4 soldiers and @entity5			2
but @entity4 @entity4 has produced a new report to suggest there is no proof the boy died or even injured @entity4 has long disputed the accusation the @entity16 was killed by @entity4 forces ' this case ... is still being used by people who are committing terror attacks against @entity4			1
it still feeds the hatred			0
' despite claiming @entity32 was not killed and may not have even been injured , the report offers no suggestion of his whereabouts 13 years on			0
according to his father , @entity32 was killed on the spot by gunfire and was buried in the @entity286 refugee cam			0
' @entity32 is not just my son , ' he said			0
' he 's the son of entire @entity5 nation			0

@entity16 was shot dead during the second @entity292 uprising

@entity4 minister brands film ' utterly baseless ' and ' modern - day blood libel '
