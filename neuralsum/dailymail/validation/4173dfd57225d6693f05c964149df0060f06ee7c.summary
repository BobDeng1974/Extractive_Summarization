my hair is thin and flat , and it never seems to grow longer than just past my shoulders			1
do you have any tips for adding much - needed volume ? @entity6 , 53 , @entity7			1
mother - of - four @entity6 was fed up of trying to make her limp hair look and feel thicker			1
like many busy women , she had found her hair had thinned , thanks to hormonal changes , but this can also be caused by stress , a poor diet or illness			1
before : mother - of - four @entity6 ( pictured ) is fed - up with trying to make her long , limp hair look thicker while @entity6 had used clip - in hair extensions in the past , and found that they worked well , she wanted a longer - lasting solution			1
the most important thing with hair extensions is that they look natural			1
it ’s equally important that they do n’t damage your real hair or prevent it from growing			1
so , we visited the @entity30 in @entity31 , @entity32 , where stylist @entity33 applied beauty works semi-permanent hair extensions			1
with 46 shades to choose from , it was easy to match them to @entity6 ’s hair colour			1
the strips of hair have a bonded keratin tip , which is attached to your hair			1
the keratin is transparent , which means that the joins are barely visible			0
@entity33 blended four different shades into @entity6 ’s hair to create a natural look			1
then , she cut them , so that they blended in with @entity6 ’s natural hair			1
after : @entity6 ( pictured ) had semi-permanent hair extensions put in at the @entity30 in @entity31 , @entity32 , they should last six months the finished result promises to last six months			1
the keratin bond can withstand washing , drying and brushing — however , good aftercare is essential			0
to keep her extensions in top condition , @entity6 was advised to use a nourishing shampoo and conditioner , along with a serum , heat protection product and weekly deep conditioning mask			1
or try the new @entity68 … not everyone is suitable for hair extensions			1
but if they ’re not for you , there are some excellent products to use as an alternative			0
the new @entity76 ( £ 9.99 , boots.com ) is designed for hair that lacks body			1
a semi-permanent treatment , it creates volume by building a polymer network onto hair fibres , enhancing the texture and fullness of individual strands			1
shampoo and conditioner can also make a real difference			2
the @entity91 and @entity92 ( £ 18.50 , ogariolondon.com ) blends pro-vitamin @entity93 , which boosts the water content of your hair			2

try @entity111 ( £ 9.99 , @entity112 ) after shampooing , then rinse			0
mousse is an old favourite for volume boosting , as the polymers and binding agents make it easier to style			2
try the @entity119 ( £ 2.50 , @entity120 )			0
finally , the @entity121 ( £ 2.50 , @entity122 ) in a handy 50 ml size is perfect for volume on the go			0

amazingly , it ’s been around for more than 100 years and can be used to soothe insect bites , blisters , burns and even skin conditions such as psoriasis and eczema			0
the rich , hydrating formula has anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties			0
the cream is thick , so it needs to be worked into the skin until absorbed			2
@entity149 essence long - lasting lipsticks ( £ 2.30 , wilko.com ) nude shades are big news for spring — especially for lips			2
the secret is to find a shade that complements your complexion			0

massage the mousse in with a tanning mitt to ensure an even coverage			0
it comes in three shades — light , medium and dark — and all are matte , so there ’s no unwanted sparkle			0
for your first self - tan of the year , it ’s always best to build up the colour slowly — so if you ’re fair - skinned , start with the lightest shade and use it over three days to get a natural glow			2
it ’s always a good idea to pick a face mask based on your skin ’s individual needs			0
