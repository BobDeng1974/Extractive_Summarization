@entity0 successfully launched supplies to the @entity2 early saturday morning , but fell short of its goal of recovering the rocket 's leftover components for later reuse			1
the company 's billionaire founder @entity7 said the first - stage of the unmanned @entity11 rocket made it to the platform floating a couple hundred miles off @entity15 's northeastern coast			1
the booster came down too hard and broke apart , he said			2
he said it bodes well for the future , though			0
it was the first time anyone tried anything like this			0
@entity7 maintains that recovering and reusing rockets is essential for bringing down launch costs and speeding up operations			1
the primary mission for @entity0 was delivering more than 5,000 pounds of supplies ordered up by @entity35 , including hasty replacements for experiments and equipment lost in the destruction of another company 's cargo ship last fall , as well as extra groceries			1
belated @entity45 presents were also on board for the six space station astronauts			1
' hurrah ! a ( hash ) @entity52 is coming to visit bringing gifts , ' @entity50 astronaut @entity49 said in a tweet from orbit			0
without interfering with the $ 133million delivery , @entity7 had fins for guidance and landing legs installed on the first stage of the rocket , and positioned a modified barge off the coast of @entity64			1
recovery : a barge floating off the coast of @entity64 , @entity15 , was supposed to recover the leftover booster , but components came down too hard and broke apart , according to @entity0 founder @entity7 brilliant : onlookers and photographers watched the trajectory of the @entity11 rocket , which lit up the sky over @entity74 , @entity15 lit up : the sky over @entity76 was illuminated early saturday morning after a successful liftoff rendezvous : the boosters later separated from the upper stage of the rocket , which continued its path towards the space station no cigar : musk was optimistic on @entity87 in spite of the crash , especially considering the feat had never before been attempted in the history of space flight a ship with @entity0 staff watched from a safe 10 miles away as the 14 - story booster approached the platform , marked with a giant @entity97 @entity7 reported that the platform itself - 300 feet by 100 feet , with wings stretching the width to 170 feet - was fine following the attempted touchdown well before dawn			1
but he said some of the equipment on deck will need to be replaced			0
there ended up being no good video of the ' landing / impact , ' he said in a tweet , noting it was ' pitch dark and foggy ' out in the ocean			0
' will piece it together from telemetry and ... actual pieces , ' he said			0
brief tv images from booster cameras , broadcast by @entity35 , showed water bubbles			0
in the weeks preceding the landing test , @entity7 had estimated there was a 50 - 50 chance , at best , that the @entity11 's first - stage booster would land vertically on the platform			1
a pair of attempts last year to bring boosters down vertically on the open ocean went well , but company officials conceded before saturday 's try that a platform touchdown was considerably more challenging			2
once separated from the upper stage of the rocket saturday , the main booster re-ignited as planned for the flyback , according to @entity0			1
automatic engine firings maneuvered the booster down toward the autonomous , modified barge			2
the @entity138 maintained the ability , as always , to destroy the booster if it strayed off course			0
@entity35 watched the post-launch drama with keen interest , but its biggest focus was on the @entity144 toward the space station			0
the capsule is due to arrive there monday			0
the shipment - the sixth by @entity0 since 2012 - is needed more than usual because of the recent loss of another company 's supply ship			1
@entity155 's @entity154 rocket exploded seconds after liftoff in october , destroying the entire payload and damaging the @entity159 launch complex			1
that rocket is grounded until next year			0
this @entity0 delivery was supposed to occur before @entity45 , but was delayed by a flawed test - firing of the rocket			1
then a problem with the rocket 's steering system cropped up at the last minute during tuesday 's initial launch attempt			1
@entity35 is paying @entity0 and @entity155 to keep the space station stocked in the wake of the retired shuttle program			2
the $ 1.6billion contract with @entity0 calls for 12 flights ; the $ 1.9billion contract with @entity155 calls for eight			2
@entity0 also returns items to @entity175 ; @entity155 can not			2
@entity176 and @entity177 will make their own supply runs this year			0
@entity0 , headquartered in @entity179 , @entity180 , also has been contracted by @entity35 to develop beefed - up dragons for astronaut rides to the space station , beginning as early as 2017			2
@entity184 also is hard at work on a manned capsule			0
in the meantime , @entity35 is paying tens of millions of dollars to @entity176 for each @entity189 astronaut launched aboard the @entity191 spacecraft .			0

the aerospace *transportation* contractor planned to land the rocket 's booster on a barge , but the booster came down too fast and broke apart
@entity0 founder @entity7 tweeted ' close , but no cigar '
the plan for recovering and reusing booster components after launch has never before been attempted , though @entity7 says it will bring down costs
the launch carried food , replacement equipment and @entity45 gifts for six astronauts aboard the @entity2
