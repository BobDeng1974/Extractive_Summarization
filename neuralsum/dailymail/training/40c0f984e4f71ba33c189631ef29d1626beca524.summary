another witness who claimed @entity2 ’s biggest funder was embroiled in vote - rigging is standing by her account – piling more pressure on @entity6 to reopen an inquiry into the scandal			2

mr @entity6 has shelved an inquiry into allegations that @entity13 ‘ stitched up ’ the @entity43 seat by signing up members to the party without their consent earlier this year , saying that a change of heart by two whistleblowers meant there was no longer enough evidence to prove the claims			2
but on monday , the @entity53 revealed that @entity54 , the whistleblower who first alleged she and her family had been signed up as @entity2 members without their consent , had rejected @entity13 claims that she had withdrawn her testimony			1
now mrs @entity9 , a member of mrs @entity54 ’s family , also maintains she was signed up to @entity2 by @entity59 – the chairman of the local constituency party and a @entity13 convener – without her consent and using her maiden name , which she has not used since she was 20			1

‘ what i ’m saying to you is we ’ve looked into all of the allegations that have been made , we ’ve talked to that family and they ’ve given us very , very clear evidence			0
’ mr @entity6 , who visited @entity99 yesterday , said he agreed that ‘ machine politics ’ had been at work in @entity43 , but insisted he was satisfied there were no grounds for a second inquiry			0
