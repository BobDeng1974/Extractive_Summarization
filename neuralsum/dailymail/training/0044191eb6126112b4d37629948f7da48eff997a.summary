click here for the stats from the game with our brilliant @entity4 service seventy - three seconds was all it took @entity7			1
well , 18 months , 19 appearances and 73 seconds , but when his first @entity10 goal finally arrived , it was wonderfully timed			1
it was a strike to puncture the pressure and soothe the nerves			2
@entity16 was engulfed by supporters and team - mates , while @entity19 punched the air			1
a striker who had forgotten the way to goal had found the net at a most crucial moment , before the result was put beyond doubt by @entity28 , a striker who seemingly can not miss. @entity28 runs towards the @entity10 fans in celebration of his second - half strike against @entity32 the @entity34 international now has 13 goals and three assists in his last 20 games for @entity19 's side @entity28 looks on as his curled strike puts @entity10 into a commanding 2 - 0 lead on wednesday night @entity10 : @entity41 7 , @entity42 7 , @entity43 6.5 , @entity44 6.5 , @entity45 6.5 , @entity46 6.5 ( @entity47 66 ' 6.5 ) , @entity48 7 ( @entity49 89 ' ) , @entity50 7 , @entity51 8 , @entity28 7.5 , @entity16 7 ( @entity52 78 ' )			1

where would @entity10 be without him ? @entity19 may choose not to dwell on that			1
what was important for the manager was victory after three games without a win , which triggered familiar complaints about his strategy from some quarters			0
for the 15th consecutive year , he leads his team into the knockout stages of the @entity106 and @entity19 is fiercely proud of this record			1
there is even an outside chance of topping the group			0
there was a clean sheet and an encouraging performance from rookie keeper @entity41 but it was not all positive news			0
@entity16 pulled a hamstring towards the end of the game and captain @entity46 limped off with a calf injury which @entity19 admitted ‘ looks quite serious ’			2
injuries have compounded inconsistent form and the squad is stretched to its limits as it enters the busy festive schedule			0
at least @entity19 knows his decision to start with @entity16 was justified			2
the 21 - year - old was included ahead of @entity52 on account of his ability to hold up the ball and bring others into the game , which he did instantly			2
the game had barely kicked off when @entity134 threw him the ball to fight for with his back to goal , near the edge of the @entity32 penalty area			1
he held off the challenge of @entity63 and flicked a pass to @entity51 , who slipped the ball back to him			0
in front of goal , @entity16 made no mistake			0
he looked offside but the flag stayed down			1
the @entity86 sighed with relief and sang : ‘ @entity148 scores when he wants ! ’ @entity48 and @entity28 zipped around on the flanks pulling yellow shirts out of line and allowed @entity50 to slide @entity16 clear again			2
with a little more time to think , his actions were far less clinical and @entity63 had time to recover and make a block			0
@entity79 ’s team , too fast and furious for @entity10 in @entity32 in the opening game of this campaign , were simply not the same			1
@entity28 curls his 57th minute strike between two @entity32 defenders to double his side 's lead @entity32 's goalkeeper @entity60 ( right ) dives at full stretch but fails to reach the striker from @entity28 @entity7 ( right ) wheels away in celebration of his second minute striker against @entity32 on wednesday night @entity16 ran straight towards the @entity10 faithful to celebrate his first competitive goal for the @entity169 they , too , have seen confidence eaten away by injuries and languish third from bottom in the @entity173 , a fact overlooked by those who have decided @entity79 should replace @entity19			1
@entity32 made a sluggish start			2
it was midway through the first half before they got any toe - hold in the game and began to test @entity10 ’s fragile defence			2
even then it was not a severe test and @entity79 cut an agitated figure on the touchline			0
for a spell either side of the interval , @entity65 enjoyed good possession in midfield and dictated the tempo , often searching to hit @entity61 on the overlap			0
@entity68 was close to connecting with a cross before @entity70 collected a nod - down from @entity61 and forced a splendid save from @entity41			0
like @entity16 , the keeper had stepped forward when it was required			0
@entity41 thwarted @entity70 again and made late saves , including a terrific one with his right boot from substitute @entity72			0
the @entity10 players celebrates the @entity202 youngster 's early goal in the @entity204 clash @entity16 looked to be in an offside position as he put the north @entity208 club into an early lead @entity16 shoots past @entity32 keeper @entity60 ( right ) to score the opening goal of the game @entity70 ( right ) sees his first half shot saved by @entity10 goalkeeper @entity41 @entity32 had emerged with greater purpose and adventure after the break but this only helped @entity10 , offering more freedom to @entity48 , @entity51 and @entity28 as they sprang on the counter-attack			1
@entity60 made a fine save with his left hand to keep out a drive by @entity28 which fizzed across the slick surface , but was stranded by a lob from the @entity224 moments later			2
@entity60 turned , expecting to see the ball drop into his goal , but it struck woodwork and bounced clear			0
the disappointment did not last			0
@entity28 took a pass from @entity51 in the inside - left area , ducked on to his right foot and curled a shot beyond the diving @entity32 keeper into the far corner			1
@entity79 made changes in a bid to shake a reaction from his team , but they had qualified already and this can play subconsciously			0
@entity10 have a glimmer of a chance to win the group , but they need to beat @entity246 and hope @entity247 win in @entity32			1
until then , @entity19 will bank the win and move on to @entity249 while praying for no more injuries			2
@entity32 manager @entity79 ( centre ) was n't happy about @entity7 's seemingly offside goal being allowed to stand @entity48 ( left ) jumps for the ball with @entity32 's @entity64 @entity16 was forced to make an early exit with what seemed to be a slight hamstring injury @entity48 reacts after seeing his thunderous 25 - yard shot hit the crossbar midway through the second half @entity28 put in a typically industrious performance for his side and deserved his second half goal @entity10 's star signing @entity28 holds his ankle following a heavy tackle at the @entity86 @entity16 holds off a challenge from @entity63 ( right ) during an impressive first half from @entity19 's side 21 - year - old striker @entity7 put his side ahead after neat work from @entity169 midfielder @entity51 ( 19 ) @entity34 international @entity28 ( right ) looks to get past a tackle from @entity32 defender @entity61 @entity71 is tackled by @entity45 during the @entity204 clash the travelling @entity32 fans did n't have to worry too much about the final result as their team have already qualified for the last 16			1

@entity7 scores first competitive goal for @entity10 to put @entity19 's side ahead
