this equates to at least $ 1 million if he lives to the age of 80			1

@entity32 was shot to death by @entity5 on december , 12 , 2011 , and his wife , left , received $ 1.5 million compensation from the department he said he initially wanted to remain with the force , but , with the case against him , it became ' too much			1
' @entity5 told the newspaper : ' when you 're gon na ( expletive ) lose everything , and there are medical issues stress-wise , and a lot of people are saying , " hey , it 's not worth it			2
you need to work on you , " toward the end , it was just too much			0
' on september 18 , @entity6 retirement board members , unanimously approved @entity5 's permanent and total disability based on recommendations from his employer , supervisor and doctor			1
two weeks later , the department 's pre-termination board heard @entity5 's shooting case and agreed he should be fired			1

if he had lost his job a month earlier , he would n't have been eligible for the disability pension			1
a member of the @entity6 board , @entity85 , executive director of the @entity2 @entity86 , said he did n't believe @entity5 was trying to avoid punishment			1
' i do n't think he ran from discipline , ' @entity85 told the @entity11			0
' both letters from doctors were saying that this is a gentleman who , from the events in his life , put him in the predicament that he probably should n't be a policeman anymore			0
it made perfect sense to me			0
' @entity85 added that knowing the department was planning to fire him may have pushed his stress levels over the edge			0
unfair ? while @entity5 , pictured making a hand signal , did n't appeal his termination , he said he does n't believe the department had enough cause to fire him ' maybe that was the straw that broke the camel 's back			2
i do n't know , ' @entity85 said			0
' whatever it was that finally pushed him over , his doctor did n't believe he could have worked as a police officer again			0

while @entity5 did n't appeal his termination , he said he does n't believe the department had enough cause to fire him			2
he believes his colleague , lt. @entity133 , who was demoted two ranks , bore as much responsibility for @entity32 's death as he did , and the department 's radio system , which officials acknowledged was n't working that night , was also to blame			1
' the department tried to paint me as an out - of - control cop , a rogue cop , ' @entity5 said			2
' it 's all @entity81			0
he wanted to take heat off a $ 42 million radio system that failed that night			0
he wanted to take heat off his lieutenant			0
