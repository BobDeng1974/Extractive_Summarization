by @entity0 published : 05:28 est , 27 september 2012 updated : 09:35 est , 28 september 2012 @entity2 - trotting @entity3 the dog has flown over the @entity4 in a helicopter and crossed the @entity6 in the latest stage of his world tour			2
after visiting more than 30 countries and stopping at iconic landmarks including the @entity13 and the @entity14 during his great journey three years ago , the plucky pup was ready to take to the skies again			1
@entity3 , who travels with his owner @entity19 , has now braved a hot air balloon flight , helicopter ride and more plane trips as he ticks more destinations off his list , including @entity25 , @entity26 and the @entity27			1
the pair began their epic journey across five continents in 2009 in a bid to help millions of dogs without a home , visiting more than 20,000 dog shelters on the way			1
the ten - year - old canine has also recently revisited some of his favourite spots including @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 , meaning he has now travelled more than 150,000 kilometres - twice the circumference of the earth			0
ms @entity19 , who uses money made from the sale of her home to fund trips , said she would not stop travelling and raising awareness until every dog had a home			1
plane brilliant : the well - travelled pup is used to having his head in the clouds pets win prize : at the cathedral in @entity80 , @entity25 , and trying his hand at golf with owner ms @entity19 during the @entity86 @entity85 in @entity87 sporting chance : @entity89 goes for a ride to warm up for a tough competition she said : ' travel remains in our bloodstream as does the case for dog adoption			1
an estimated half a billion dogs on the planet are homeless			1
' when they 're adopted , we 'll unbuckle our seat belts and put our paws up			2
' @entity3 loved the helicopter ride over the @entity4 he seemed a little disappointed there were n't any crocs in the @entity4 but anxiously watched at every turn for the odd animal to visually chase			0
' during the balloon ride he barked his brains out			0
there must be something about all that fire in the sky that makes him barking mad			0
@entity119 : @entity3 by the @entity6 in @entity87 and with owner @entity19 and friends in @entity121 , @entity60 what a star : @entity3 on the @entity123 in @entity124 travelling in style : @entity3 tries out yet another mode of transport in @entity128 far from his basket : @entity132 's beautiful @entity131 was another fascinating landscape for the dog to take in canine companion : a @entity137 driver in @entity138 does n't quite know what to make of his unusual passenger kennel kid : if ms @entity19 had not adopted @entity3 from the shelter , he might not have had a loving owner - or the chance to visit so many far - flung spots ' perhaps his most impressive achievement is that he has endured several flights lasting 16 hours and more and has n't even lifted a leg			1
' it 's a miracle he 's still even alive though			0
if i had n't gone to the kennel that fateful day @entity3 would have had one more day left and would have been put down			2
' when i discovered what a wonderful dog @entity3 was it broke my heart to think how many @entity155 are still out there and simply just do n't get that second chance			0
' i want to change perceptions of shelter dogs being old , abused and disturbed animals			2
nothing could be further from the truth			0
' le chien : @entity3 checks out the @entity13 in @entity164 , having now visited @entity61 several times just barking : @entity3 has some fun with a novel disguise on a beach in @entity169 @entity171 surprise : @entity3 meets @entity172 and his equally adventurous pal in @entity26			0

furry flier is well used to planes after visiting more than 30 countries
he was adopted from a kennel by owner @entity19 and now the tiny traveller helps her raise awareness about the *plight* of *unwanted* dogs
