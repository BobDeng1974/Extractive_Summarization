some games from childhood last a lifetime and the 1990 @entity3 semi-final between @entity5 and @entity6 is one that has stayed with me			2
i remember coming in from playing @entity9 football and being completely stunned that @entity5 could lose 4 - 3 to opponents like @entity6			1
it was a defeat that stripped @entity5 ’s aura of invincibility and , i felt , started the club ’s demise			0
there is no doubt @entity6 have been a bogey team for @entity5			2
they shattered @entity20 ’ hopes of bringing the title back to @entity23 and the effects of that 3 - 3 draw were still being felt all the way through to last november , when @entity5 folded at @entity27 and were beaten 3 - 1			1
@entity6 players and supporters celebrate during the @entity3 semi-final win against @entity5 in 1990 @entity31 is mobbed by his @entity6 team - mates after scoring the winner in the famous 4 - 3 victory @entity35 celebrates after scoring the winner for @entity6 in their 3 - 1 win against @entity5 last november click here to read what @entity41 columnist @entity40 has had to say about the @entity43 only after that defeat were @entity5 able to start recovering and while they head into saturday night 's @entity3 fifth - round tie with an opportunity to really build some momentum , the squad will be conscious of the threat @entity31 ’s men pose			1
it is the tie of the weekend , as @entity6 will be aiming to inflict further misery on @entity5 and dreaming of the chance to repeat their achievements of 1990 and get back to @entity56			2
they can be difficult opposition when the home crowd get behind them			0
this match , however , is huge for @entity5			0
with their hopes of getting into the top four still delicately balanced and a tough @entity65 fixture against @entity67 looming , they can not afford to let the @entity3 slip away			0
they can not suffer at the hands of their bogeymen again			0
@entity5 manager @entity20 ( left ) walks towards the dressing room after the november defeat @entity5 players look dejected after throwing away a three - goal lead - and the title - at @entity27 last may			1
