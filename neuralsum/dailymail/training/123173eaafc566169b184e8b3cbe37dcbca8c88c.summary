by @entity0 published : 13:27 est , 7 march 2014 updated : 06:45 est , 8 march 2014 a man who bought a talking toy remote control for his toddler grandson was outraged when it blurted out ' f * * * s ' instead of the number six			1
@entity8 , 61 , paid Â £ 4.50 for the @entity9 at an @entity11 branch in @entity12 , @entity13 , for 18 - month - old @entity14 who he said was ' mad about gadgets '			1
he returned it to store staff - who said they agreed it sounded rude and said they would clear all other models from the shelves			2
foul - mouthed : @entity8 , 61 , was shocked when he realised the toy he bought at @entity11 for his 18 - month - old grandson @entity14 was blurting out ' f * * * s ' in a robotic voice instead of the number six hanging on the telephone : mr @entity8 claimed his complaints to the firm were not taken seriously enough but although the supermarket said mr @entity8 was the only customer to complain , he fears the foul - mouthed toy could be a bad influence on other children			1
the grandfather - of - 10 said : ' @entity14 was just sat playing with it one day pressing the buttons when we heard it			2
when you press the six button it says the f - word			2
@entity9 : the firm said 20,000 of the toys have been sold and this was the first complaint ' call me old - fashioned but i believe that a child 's first words should be mum or dad , or maybe please and thank you , but not four - letter swear words			1
' he added : ' @entity14 's mad about gadgets and will press the buttons of anything he can get his hands on			0
he likes to mess around with our @entity62 and have the @entity64 on , even if he 's not playing on it			0
' a few times he 's picked up the phone and ended up calling somebody , so we thought we 'd buy him his own phone and that would keep him happy			0
' the retired plant worker , from @entity71 , @entity13 , bought the plastic pink toy which he described as a phone on january 23			1
when he noticed the defect he returned it to @entity11 and complained to toy firm @entity9			1
he said : ' they agreed with me it sounded rude and gave me my money back and assured me they would make sure no more were on the shelf			0
' but when i went back a couple of weeks later they had restocked the shelves with more of the phones			0
' i took one to the customer service lady who said they did n't have the authority to take items off the shelves			0
' she said she 'd look into it but did n't really seem interested			0
i do n't have a problem with @entity11 , but i think there 's been a lack of communication in customer services			2
' this has been going on for weeks now ... i 'm surprised no - one else has complained			0
bad education : mr @entity8 hoped the toy would teach @entity14 to count , but it taught him otherwise @entity100 : @entity14 's grandmother said it was a good thing their other nine grandchildren and not picked it up ' [ @entity9 ] said it was n't their problem and advised that i got in touch with the distributors , so i sent them an email and recieved no reply			1
' his wife @entity111 , 60 , added : ' luckily , @entity14 is too young to pick up the language , but i would be really annoyed if one of my older grandchildren started playing with it			0
' @entity14 is the couple 's youngest grandson , and they look after him during the day while his mother @entity119 , 35 , works as a secondary school teacher			2
a joint statement by @entity11 and @entity9 said : ' we sold 20,000 of these products last year and this is the first complaint we 've had of this nature			1
