by @entity0 the @entity1 appear to be like any other ordinary @entity3 family			1
but @entity5 and @entity6 's extraordinary journey began when their first child was brought into the world sooner than anticipated			1
@entity9 was delivered at 30 weeks , weighing just 1.2kg			1
this was n't the kind of parenthood the @entity14 couple had imagined			2
the @entity16 family , from @entity14 , are this year 's ambassadors of @entity18 - an annual event which aims to raise funds for families with premature and sick babies @entity16 who was born in 2009 at 28 weeks and weighed 1150 grams @entity23 was born half the size of his twin brother @entity25 and weighed 698 grams @entity26 was born in 2007 at 30 weeks and weighed 1275 grams ' i had the most perfect pregnancy , ' mrs @entity26 told @entity29			1
' no morning sickness , i was n't showing that much and i still very active			2
' the complications started when mrs @entity26 discovered she had a severe case of pre-eclampsia			0
' i was in utter shock and bewilderment , ' she said			0
' it was a foreign world to me			0
i had no family history of it and all my sisters gave birth without any complications			0
' we just had no knowledge on what we were about to embark on and it was so scary , so daunting			0
' @entity45 was born 10 weeks early in october 2007 and was held in the @entity47 's neonatal intensive care unit , in @entity48 , for seven to eight weeks			1
' my mother - in - law described her as two pounds of butter but i was telling people that @entity45 was like a 1.25 l coke bottle with arms and legs , ' mrs @entity26 said			1
two years later , when the couple received the news of twins , they tried to prepare themselves for the worst			1
@entity5 , severe from pre-eclampsia , holds her twins @entity23 and @entity25 @entity62 with her son @entity25 who nearly died four days after he was born ' we kept saying the twins are probably going to come early , ' mrs @entity26 said			1
' we thought we 'd probably have them at 34 weeks and we were comfortable with that			2
' but the obstetrician told them otherwise			0
' if you make it to 30 weeks , i 'd be wrapped , â€™ the doctor told them			1
at that point , mrs @entity26 felt helpless that she could n't do anything about the situation			0
' i felt like i had failed as a mother , ' she said			0
' you just blame it on yourself			0
the one thing you think you should be able to do as a female is to have a baby			0
' but i was putting them through a horrible , an absolutely horrible , start to life			0
' @entity23 and @entity25 were born at 28 weeks in october 2009 , weighing 698g and 1150g			1
' we thought we 'd be okay because we 'd been through it but when we actually entered into that world , it was completely different from before , ' mrs @entity26 said			0
' when i saw @entity23 , i was so horrified at how small he was			1
he was the size of a coke can with arms and legs			0
' @entity6 with his daughter @entity45 who still has ongoing issues with her eyes mrs @entity26 had to wait three weeks until she could hold @entity25 for the first time			1
' @entity25 had some heart problems , nearly died on day four when he contracted a staph infection and doctors thought he was n't going to make it , ' she said			1
' so he was on a ventilator for a month and he was still on it when i cuddled him at three - weeks - old			2
' there were lots of tears			0
it was an amazing and precious moment			0
' while @entity25 battled through and started showing signs of recovery , @entity23 could n't get his breathing and feeding under control			1
consequently , he was on oxygen for a year and a half and was fed through a tube until he was three years old			2
he had his first taste of real food at the age of two			0
the twins spent 99 days in the same neonatal intensive care unit as @entity9			2
however @entity23 was soon readmitted to hospital and was in and out for over a year			1
@entity25 and @entity23 , 4 , with their older sister @entity45 , 7 , are all thriving at school ' i 'm so proud of my kids , so proud of our journey and how far we 've come , ' mrs @entity26 said through it all , the @entity131 could n't be any closer			1
' if it was n't for my parents and @entity6 's parents , i do n't know if we would 've survived , ' mrs @entity26 said			2
' at the time we would just cling onto any kind of positiveness			0
it was way to keep sane			0
otherwise we would crush and not cope			0
' this year the @entity1 have been named the official ambassadors for the @entity144 's @entity143 's walk for @entity145			1
the annual event will be held across @entity3 on october 26 to raise funds for families of premature or sick babies			1
' i 'm very honoured , ' mrs @entity26 said			0
' i 'm so proud of my kids , so proud of our journey and how far we 've come			0
' she hopes to raise awareness to let other parents know that they 're not alone			2
' there are so many of us out there and it 's not your fault that this happened , ' she said			2
while @entity45 , 6 , and the twins , 4 , are thriving at school there are still some health complications			1
' they still have a lot of issues but when we think about how may not have been here , we 're just so happy they 're alive , ' mrs @entity26 said			2
@entity3 families gathered for last year 's walk for @entity145 event			1
