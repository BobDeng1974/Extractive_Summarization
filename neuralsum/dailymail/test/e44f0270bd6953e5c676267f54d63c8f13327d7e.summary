travelling with a pet can be a stressful and expensive ordeal , but @entity2 have come up with a way to put passengers at ease when their pet is in the carrier below			2
the new pet gps system allows owners to track their furry friends ' journeys in real time , from monitoring the temperature below , to whether their cage is upright or askew			2
the first - of - its - kind technology was developed by @entity16 and is available for $ 50 per flight from 10 @entity19 airports			1
@entity2 's new pet gps , available for $ 50 per flight , allows owners to track their pets on a plane via a website the move was no doubt aimed to make passengers feel safer about bringing their pets with them on flights , as @entity2 has a less than rosy history of pet fatalities on board			1
tragically between 2010 and 2013 , @entity2 reported the greatest number of animal incidents and was held responsible for 41 of the 97 reported deaths that year			1
they maintain that the high numbers are due to the fact they carry a higher number of pets than competitors			0
the service is available from 10 @entity19 airlines including @entity42 and @entity43 two months ago it was reported that @entity2 failed to load a number of show dogs on a flight , and staff admitted they did not know where the prized pets were , when they were asked by customers			1
the dogs had been competing at the prestigious @entity53 in @entity54 and were headed for @entity55			0
angry passengers disembarked and were given a free overnight stay at a hotel near @entity59 , a refund of their $ 200 dog fees , vip service at the airport and spots in the cabin for the dogs for the return flight to @entity55			0
it is hoped the @entity16 technology , which has similar trackers for keeping tabs on alcohol and tobacco and to make sure seafood is kept cold , will give owners peace of mind during their travels			0
owners of pets at the @entity53 in @entity54 were told their pets were not on board their @entity2 flight , and disembarked to go and find them the pets were safely retrieved , but the airlines has had a number of animal related incidents in the past			0

the trackers allows owners to check carrier *conditions* like temperature
