@entity1 captain @entity0 says the players have to share responsibility for an alarming slump that has seen them win just one of their last 12 @entity8 matches			1
wednesday 's 2 - 0 defeat at @entity10 left the @entity1 in 14th place , just six points above the drop zone with 10 games to go , although 18th - placed @entity15 have a match in hand			1
this latest loss saw the heat turned up on @entity1 boss @entity20 with ' Â£ @entity21 ' trending in the @entity22 on @entity23 in the aftermath - despite fans in the away end at the @entity25 showing vociferous support for him and the team at half - time - but @entity0 insists the squad must also take the blame			2
@entity1 captain @entity0 says the players must take responsibility for their poor @entity8 form @entity34 international @entity0 says it is time for the players to ' buck up our ideas ' ' the fans were great ( against @entity10 )			1
it has been a difficult season to watch us because the performances have not been as good as last season , ' @entity0 told the @entity44			0
' they are going to vent their frustrations , it is normally the manager that gets it as he is head of the food chain			0
' but we as players know we need to buck our ideas up , start performing better and take pressure off him , pressure off ourselves and start getting some more points			0
' @entity20 is coming under increasing pressure to turn it around after one league win in 12 games @entity1 manager @entity20 and his team look lost in the @entity8 of late @entity20 swept into @entity61 in 2013 armed with promising sound bites and a snappy dress sense to match a refreshing cavalier playing style that had taken @entity65 to @entity67 glory only a month earlier			1
the former @entity69 midfielder also oversaw @entity65 's relegation from the top flight , but that was largely forgotten as he proved a runaway success on @entity74 , taking @entity1 back into @entity75 after a four - year absence and just missing out on a place in the @entity78			2
but this season has proved much more difficult for the @entity1 , with a porous defence and stuttering form in front of goal leading to a growing sense of frustration			0
@entity86 ( centre ) rises up to head home his side 's opening goal en route to a 2 - 0 victory against @entity1 @entity10 substitute @entity93 sealed win with a late goal after reacting to @entity97 's rebound what has vexed supporters even more is their contrasting displays in the @entity101 , with the @entity1 beating high - flying @entity103 outfit @entity102 home and away en route to a largely trouble - free run into the last 16			1
the visit of @entity108 is next up for @entity1 in that competition , but @entity0 concedes their focus now has to be moving clear of the @entity8 's basement battle			2
' we know we need to concentrate on our league form , ' he added			0
' we have 10 games left now and need to pull our finger out and start picking up points			0
