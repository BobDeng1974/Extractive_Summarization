by @entity0 published : 16:49 est , 8 may 2013 updated : 02:25 est , 9 may 2013 @entity1 has been accused of plotting a ' @entity3 tax ' on singletons as its local authorities demand an end to council tax discounts for those living alone			1
in a formal submission to ministers , the @entity9 is calling for the power to end the 25 per cent discount offered in recognition of the fact single people place fewer demands on local services			1
more than seven million are thought to benefit from the discount , at a cost of around £ 2.7billion a year			1
@entity20 targeted for tax : @entity22 as @entity3 in the 2001 film @entity23 but if town halls get their way a single person living in a typical @entity26 property would see their council tax bill rise from £ 1,083 to £ 1,444 – an increase of £ 361 a year , or £ 30 a month			1
councils are also demanding the removal of a rule that forces them to hold a referendum if they want to increase council tax			0
they said town halls should be free to raise council tax by as much as they like			0
the @entity9 is an umbrella group representing hundreds of councils of different political persuasions			2
but sources claim the campaign to end the discount is being driven by @entity1 authorities including @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51			1
communities secretary @entity52 said : ' there is clearly a well - orchestrated campaign being pushed forward by @entity1 councillors to target the most vulnerable			0
' this is a @entity3 tax and shows how out of touch @entity1 are			0
' @entity52 , the communities secretary , has criticised the @entity9 's proposal as a ' @entity3 ' tax in its submission , the @entity9 calls for councils to be given the ' full and unconstrained ability to vary locally all council tax discounts , including the single person 's discount '			1
councils argue the power is needed to help them deal with a 10 per cent cut in funding for discounts this year			2
local authorities are also angry at legislation forcing them to hold a local referendum if they want to increase council tax by more than 2 per cent a year			1
the rule was introduced following a free - for - all during @entity1 's years in power when council tax bills doubled			2
no council has yet dared to stage a referendum , although a number raised council tax by 1.99 per cent this year			0
ministers have provided funding for a council tax freeze for three years running , equivalent to a 9.7 per cent cut in real terms for bill payers			0
but more than 30 per cent of councils chose to increase their bills this year , arguing the government could not guarantee long - term funding			0
the @entity9 said town halls should be given ' flexibility around income generation , including council tax '			2
a government source said there is no prospect of the referendum rule being lifted .			0

@entity9 calls for power to end 25 *%* discount
more than seven million singletons are thought to benefit from it
it costs local authorities around the country £ 2.7billion a year
