by @entity0 published : 08:46 est , 30 october 2013 updated : 11:28 est , 30 october 2013 for most people , waking up covered in blood is the stuff of horror films			1
but for 22 - year - old @entity6 it became a horrifying reality of life			1
miss @entity6 used to self - harm in her sleep and woke with injuries ranging from small grazes , to gashes which left pools of blood in her bedding			1
@entity6 ( pictured with her boyfriend @entity19 ) developed a form of sleepwalking which saw her cut herself in her sleep - it was so bad that she would wake up to find her sheets soaked in blood she struggled with an unusual and terrifying form of sleepwalking but has recently found relief thanks to a combination of medication and therapy			1
she was given sleeping tablets in an attempt to put her into such a deep sleep that she could n't get up during the night			1
when this treatment failed , she was referred for a form of hypnotherapy known as sleep therapy			1
this treatment has now put an end to her night time injuries			1
miss @entity6 said : ' i had one - on - one sessions with a sleep therapist and a counsellor			1
the therapist focused on examining my stress levels and revisiting the memories of self - harming while i was awake when i was younger			1
' it scared me to think that my body was reacting in the way it did because i had no conscious outlet for the stress i was feeling			0
' after the sessions with the therapist and the counsellor , i was much more relaxed			0
at first , i was still harming myself in my sleep , but the injuries became less bad			1
' it stopped completely after me and my current boyfriend , @entity59 , became close again			0
we were very close friends when i was 16 , but i lost contact with him between the ages of 19 and 21			0
' it hurt to be apart from him			1
but since i 've been in my current job , and in a stable relationship , i 've never felt better			0
' @entity68 ( pictured in september 2011 while she was sleepwalking ) said she was terrified because she did not know why she kept waking up with cuts on her legs @entity68 ( pictured with her mother , @entity71 ) feared she would unintentionally hurt her parents or brother during one of her sleepwalking episodes until she received treatment , @entity68 would use knives to cut her legs while she was asleep			1
she said : ‘ at first i did n’t know what was going on			0
i knew no - one could have been coming into my room during the night			1
‘ the injuries ranged from little spots and cuts to quite severe marks which left a lot of blood on my bed sheets			2
the only rational explanation was that i was doing it to myself			0
’ the frightening night episodes began when @entity68 was 19 , as she struggled emotionally following the breakdown of a relationship			2
she was terrified that her inexplicable night time activities would eventually lead her to hurt her mother , @entity71 , 52 , father , @entity94 , 54 , or brother , @entity96 , 23			1
‘ i was able to piece together what was happening - i was getting out of bed and finding sharp objects , like knives , and then hurting myself , ’ she said			2
‘ i must have wandered all around the house looking for cutting tools			0
but i had no idea i was doing it			0
’ miss @entity6 was eventually referred for a form of hypnotherapy called sleep therapy , which finally put an end to her night time antics she added : ‘ i was always worried i was going to hurt my parents			1
i would n’t dream of hurting them , but then i did n’t have any control			0
’ serious injuries occurred nearly every week and soon @entity68 was anxious that nothing could be done to stop her bizarre behaviour			0
she said : ‘ it started happening with no warning at all			0
i had self - harmed when i was a younger teenager , but i had n’t done anything like it for years			2
miss @entity6 has now taken the step of covering the scars on her right leg with a colourful tattoo of @entity124 and @entity125 from @entity126 ‘ i sought help from my mum almost straight away			1
i ’d gone to her when i hurt myself when i was younger , so i thought of seeking help from her first			2
‘ she was so supportive			0
she came to every single appointment with me , and every therapy session			2
‘ at first the doctors thought i was doing it to myself while i was awake			2
they sent me to counselling and analysed me , and put me on strong sleeping tablets which they thought would knock me out to the extent that i would n’t be able to move when i was asleep			1
‘ but they did n’t work			0
i became more and more stressed			0
‘ i kept nagging the doctors for help			2
they sent me for sleep therapy - a form of hypnotism - which began to make a difference			1
as the injuries became less severe , i breathed a big sigh of relief			0
’ @entity68 , from @entity146 , has not experienced any such injuries for a year			0
this week she moved into her own flat , confident her nocturnal self - harming has gone for good			2
having completed her therapy treatment , she is being supported through her recovery by her boyfriend @entity19 , 23			2
miss @entity6 said : ‘ i feel freed from my behaviour , as if i ’m able to move on with my life			1
’ she has even taken the step of covering the scars on her right leg with a colourful tattoo			0
she said : ‘ you ca n’t see the scars on my legs any more			0
most of them have been covered by a tattoo of @entity124 and @entity125 from @entity126 - it ’s one of my favourite films			0

@entity6 had a form of sleepwalking which saw her cut her legs
she would wake up to find her bedclothes soaked in blood
she feared she might hurt her parents or brother in her sleep
doctors tried giving her sleeping pills to put her into such a deep sleep that she would n't get up during the night - they did n't solve the problem
was eventually cured by a form of hypnotherapy known as sleep therapy
