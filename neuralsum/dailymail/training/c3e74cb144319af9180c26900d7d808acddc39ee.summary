by @entity0 published : 17:14 est , 24 july 2013 updated : 01:52 est , 25 july 2013 like many women , i buy clothes because i like the way they look on skinny models in fashion magazines			1
but unlike them i am 43 , a size 12 and mother of two children , so i ’ve also learned to try to disguise my problem areas			1
i know my husband would rather see me in tight dresses but i prefer floaty clothes which are a size too big for me and hide a multitude of sins			1
or do they ? mail fashion editor @entity19 took four wardrobe staples to show how the right outfit can make me look a stone lighter , and the wrong one a stone heavier ... fattening , left : pleated maxi dress , £ 199 , tedbaker.com			1
@entity25 , £ 85.50 , russellandbromley.co.uk @entity26 , right : illusion panel dress , £ 75 , phase - eight.co.uk			1
@entity25 , £ 39.99 , zara.com @entity28 , @entity29 : i feel like a @entity32 goddess in this halterneck maxi dress , but when i really look at my reflection , i realise that , sadly , i do n’t resemble one			1
it looks as if my head is poking out of the top of a festival tent - there ’s room for my whole family in here - and the halterneck that i believed was a failsafe flatterer makes my shoulders look broad			1
i thought the loose shape would skim over my physique , but without a belt it makes me look shapeless			1
perhaps if i were in my 20s , with toned , slender arms , i might be able to carry off this dress			1
as it is , i just look as though i have rather a lot to hide			1
i ’ve easily gained a stone just by putting this on			1
@entity26 , illusion panel dress : when even supermodels like @entity60 and @entity61 wear illusion dresses to enhance their perfectly proportioned physiques , it would seem sensible to take notice			1
but i ’ve never liked these dresses : they look a bit comical , somehow , and surely the optical illusion is too obvious to fool anyone ? but when @entity19 finally convinces me to try this on , i really like it			1
it ’s not too tight or revealing , but it is alluring , though a little too obviously sexy for my taste			1
importantly though , the dark panels at the sides definitely make me look thinner			1
a stone seems to have instantly vanished			1
fattening , left : wrap dress , £ 79 , phase - eight.co.uk			1
@entity25 , £ 29.99 , zara.com			1
@entity26 , right : tunic dress , £ 40 , oasis - stores.com			1
shoes , £ 39.99 , zara.com @entity28 , horizontal stripes : i adore horizontal stripes			2
i own at least five breton tops and a horizontal - striped dress , so i love this graphic tunic as soon as i see it			2
it ’s fun and funky , and i think the straight shape is elegant and youthful			2
but once i ’ve put it on , as @entity19 gently helps me see , i realise that i look like a giant bee or a zebra crossing			2
the horizontal stripes make me look so much wider , while the dress hangs unflatteringly from my shoulders , with no hint of a waist underneath			2
based on what i ’ve seen today , i fear my beloved stripy tops may have to go ! @entity26 , @entity99 stripes : i can see the appeal of this pretty striped dress to other women , but i ’d never have considered it for myself			2
it ’s not just the lack of sleeves or the plunging neckline that would have put me off ; it ’s the whole @entity107 style , which i never imagined could suit me			2
i ’ve always been athletic rather than curvy , so i thought looser styles were more flattering for my shape			1
to my surprise , i found the nipped - in waist and diagonal stripes drew the eye and gave me the hourglass shape i ’ve never had			2
i look so much slimmer ! the diagonal stripes are definitely a trick i ’d try again			2
fattening : left , top , £ 30 , and linen trousers , £ 39 , hobbs.co.uk			2
@entity25 , £ 85.50 , and clutch , £ 255 , russellandbromley.co.uk			2
slimming : right , green peplum top , £ 35 , jaeger.co.uk			2
blue bow belt , £ 29,hobbs.co.uk			2
@entity125 slim - leg trousers , £ 89 , reiss.com @entity126 , @entity127 : like strawberries and cream , the combination of white linen trousers and a mint - green linen top seems perfect for a summer ’s day			2
on the hanger , both items exude casual elegance			0
but once on , the baggy trousers swamp me , and the drawstring waist does n’t help at all			0
while a tighter top may work better , this floppy number makes me look big			0
this is an especially galling realisation as i have a pair of almost identical trousers at home , which i wear with a linen shirt			0
the outfit may have to go			0
@entity26 , dark , bold colours : these trousers are a hit : dark blue , body skimming and stretchy , they streamline my legs beautifully			0
i ’m wary of the top - i do n’t like the colour or the lack of sleeves - but once i get it on , i realise that i ’ve got it horribly wrong again , and @entity19 has got it absolutely right			1
the peplum actually makes my waist look narrower - an effect which is enhanced by the skinny belt			0
i would never have chosen this outfit myself , but i have to admit i really like it			0
fattening , left : pleated midi skirt , £ 49 , jaeger.co.uk			0
@entity168 , £ 35 , reiss.co.uk			0
jacket , £ 59 , and shoes , £ 79 , hobbs.co.uk			0
@entity26 , right : pencil skirt , £ 140 , jaeger.co.uk			0
@entity168 , £ 28 , johnlewis.com			0
heels , £ 67 , hobbs.co.uk @entity28 , @entity174 : a pleated mid-length skirt teamed with a jacket and high heels is my failsafe choice for summer weddings and smart events			1
but looking at this picture , i ’m going to have to rethink that			0
the pleats on the skirt add extra bulk to my hips , while the length cuts off my calves at their widest point			0
and looking at it carefully , i realise my usual choice of a boxy jacket is stiff			1
it hangs straight from my shoulders and skims my waist , making me look square			0
regardless , it ’s more comfortable - and classier - than the ‘ slimming ’ skirt			0
i think i ’ll chance the extra stone			0
@entity26 , tight and high - @entity203 : while i like the sexy secretary look on other women - @entity206 from @entity207 springs to mind - i never thought i could carry it off myself			1
this tight , high - waisted skirt looks as though it would cling to every lump and bump , while the draped top is too revealing for my tastes			0
but once i ’ve wriggled into it , the slimline skirt does make me look leaner and several inches taller			0
and while i ’d feel more relaxed with the addition of a jacket , the wrap top is less revealing than i ’d feared			0
this look just is n’t me , though			0
i may look slimmer , but i do n’t feel comfortable			0
i ’ve spent years swamping myself in clothes that are too big for me , thinking they make me look slimmer			1
now , rather late in the day , i realise that showing off my body — with all its imperfections — is wiser and more flattering			1
forget the diet - losing a stone was simple with a few clever wardrobe tweaks			0
i ’m amazed by what this experiment has taught me - but nobody else seems to be ! ‘ i ’ve always hated you in linen , ’ my mother tells me			0
‘ it makes you look so much larger than you are			0
’ ( why she has n’t said anything for 43 years is beyond me			1
) my husband , of course , is delighted , and dives eagerly into my wardrobe in search of the items he detests most			0
he quickly amasses a huge reject pile in the middle of the bedroom floor : on it , a beloved floaty , full - length blue cotton skirt , linen trousers , the stripy dress and a waistless green satin shirt i ’ve just bought in the sales			1
‘ you can dump anything sludge - coloured too ! ’ he continues gleefully , adding several beige and cream t - shirts to the heap			0
eventually , all i have left are a couple of figure - hugging dresses , a pair of skinny jeans and my best suit			1
time for some serious shopping , but only if i can take @entity19 with me			0
@entity263 : l + @entity264 and make - up : @entity266			0

@entity0 , 43 , a size 12 , thought floaty clothes hid a multitude of sins
but fit and colour choice made a flattering *difference* to her figure
