by @entity0 they stare into the camera with wide - eyed innocence			0
but it will not be long before these cute kittens grow into powerful predators			0
two young wildcats , named @entity8 and @entity9 after the @entity11 characters , were born at the animal park at @entity13 run by the @entity14			2
their arrival came as it emerged that as few as 400 of @entity19 's wildcats survive in the wild , as the species is under threat from inter-breeding			1
one of two wildcat kittens named @entity8 and @entity9 at @entity25 , near @entity26			0
resesearchers now say there may be just 35 left in the wild			1
experts have issued a fresh warning over the future of the @entity19 wildcat @entity33 hope : a genetic test is currently under development which , if successful , will show definitively whether individual cats are pure - bred wildcats or hybrids the new study found that wildcat numbers may have been overestimated however , a new dna test is offering hope that the species might survive			1
the test , which could be ready by @entity45 , could identify which cats are pure - bred , and which are hybrid and pave the way for a breeding programme which could save the species			1
it would allow for the testing of cats both in captivity and in the wild and for measures to be taken to protect those pure - bred wildcats that remained from being hybridised into extinction			1
the current official estimate of 400 @entity19 wildcats remaining in the wild is an informed guess ; the worst - case scenario ‘ that there is none ’ is a genuine possibility			1
@entity64 , animal collections manager at the @entity25 , said : ‘ we get our knickers in a twist because the @entity68 are n’t doing all they can to protect their tigers , or the @entity70 their black rhinos , but it ’s ok for us to let this one slip through the net ? i do n’t think so			0
last of its kind ? with just 400 thought to remain in the wild and those under threat from inter-breeding these could be some of last pictures of @entity82 wildcats the animals are one of the big attractions at the park in @entity13 , which is run by the @entity14 ‘ here we have this iconic emblem of the @entity88 and if we do n’t get our finger out , it will become extinct , guaranteed			1
’ wildcats are the only remaining large mammal predator and the only surviving cat native to @entity93			2
persecution and deforestation contributed to a drop in numbers during the 18th and 19th centuries , but although suitable habitat has increased again , their numbers have continued to dwindle , due partly to disease and road accidents , but mainly to interbreeding with domestic cats			0
@entity64 said : ‘ if you let dogs run feral , people would be up in arms for a very good reason			0
@entity110 ? they think it ’s all right			0
‘ we do n’t want to stop anyone having cats , but we want to shut off the taps of more animals going to live a feral existence and cross-breeding with wildcats			2
’ at risk : the test , which could be ready by @entity45 , would pave the way for further , much - needed wildcat conservation work one of the two new kittens born at the wildlife park the kittens stalk around their mother as they enjoy the sunshine at the @entity25			0

experts face *challenge* to preserve the species in the @entity19 wild
fewer than 400 of @entity19 's wildcats are left
species under threat from inter-breeding
dna test offers hope to identify pure breeds and ensure their survival
