by professor @entity0 published : 16:00 est , 28 september 2013 updated : 16:00 est , 28 september 2013 when @entity3 singer @entity2 married @entity5 film director @entity4 and decamped to @entity6 , she picked up more than a penchant for real ale			1
her accent took on a strange , clipped @entity11 tone			2
and she ’s not the only one			0
@entity13 seems to swing from cockney rebel , like her rocker dad @entity15 , to @entity17 drawl , while former @entity19 host @entity18 has the most bizarre of all ‘ mid-atlantic ’ accents			0
at the other end of the spectrum , @entity24 ’s strong @entity23 accent allegedly made her so difficult to understand while hosting @entity27 that she was fired			2
language barrier : @entity2 picked up an @entity11 accent from her ex-husband , and although born in @entity32 , after growing up on a tourbus and in @entity17 , it is no surprise @entity13 's speech is a bit mixed - up a fickle accent is not just a celebrity malady – new research has shown @entity40 are picking up @entity6 inflections , apparently from watching @entity42			1
so why do some people ’s accents seem to change , depending on who they are with , while others retain theirs ? here , @entity48 , professor of @entity11 at @entity49 , explains why our accents are so fickle			2
why do accents change ? every time we speak to someone we make tiny adjustments in our speech			1
we either move away from or towards their manner of speaking			0
it ’s not just accent that changes , but phrases and words too			2
sometimes these changes are noticeable ( ever been embarrassed by accidentally sounding as though you ’re mimicking somebody with a strong accent ? ) , but usually changes are too slight to pick up without recording and analysing speech			1
does our accent change on a more permanent basis ? absolutely			1
over time , adjustments become embedded in our linguistic system , especially if you move abroad or to another part of the country			1
cooked accent : master chef host @entity18 speaks with an unidentified ' @entity80 ' twang it can take a few weeks or months , or not happen for many years , depending how much you are immersed in the accent			2
if i watch lots of @entity3 films will i develop an accent ? it ’s unlikely that too many episodes of friends will make you sound like a @entity92 , though you will probably pick up some inflections and slang			1
our accents alter over time as we hear different things , but tv and radio merely provide an amplifying effect to changes already under way			2
in @entity40 , for example , the speech shifts we found were already occurring : @entity42 has just speeded them up			1
do we pick up accents because we want to be like someone ? it depends on how engaged you are in a programme			0
if you have a favourite character , you ’re more likely to copy their accent , but the news will have little impact on your speech because you are n’t identifying with the presenter or their life			1
do we all flit from accent to accent ? no. we all have an accent norm , developed mainly from our parents and peers as we grew up			2
generally we are talking to people with accents similar to our own			0
and as we speak , we are listening to our own voice and that reinforces our own accent			0
why do some people hold their accents but others do n’t ? it depends on the individual			0
there are differences in our capacity to imitate others			0
taking on a new accent is a mental rather than a physical shift – we ’re simply copying body language , as that is what speech ultimately is			1
it ’s also down to how much contact you ’re having with different accents			0
if you are only with locals , then speech will adapt much more quickly than if you are surrounded by a network of colleagues or family with your own accent			1
are there general patterns of accent change in the @entity5 ? yes			1
consonants seem to be changing quite rapidly , and certain consonant features seem to have spread out from the @entity6 area and are now found right across the country			0
for example , this includes saying ‘ fink ’ for ‘ think ’			0
vowels are less prone to change at a local level			0
if you get a train from @entity40 to @entity6 and hop out at every station , vowels sound completely different as you descend the country			1
there is a lot of levelling in the @entity172 of @entity32 , though – around @entity6 accents are very similar			0
can you develop foreign accents after brain damage ? @entity176 is well documented , but it does n’t happen as you ’d think			0
i studied a woman who woke up with a @entity180 accent after a stroke , and when we actually analysed her speech we found only a few small sounds were really the same as a @entity180 accent			1
however , those subtle changes were enough for her to sound @entity180 to people listening to her speak			0
just as with visual perception , where we do n’t need many elements to see a face , our brain receives small amounts of audio information and makes sense of it by interpreting an accent			0
the tiny changes in her voice were probably brought on by some kind of speech production change , caused by the stroke .			1

humans make tiny speech adjustments every time we address a new person
research has found @entity40 have picked up an accent from @entity42
permanent change of accent is often a result of moving abroad
