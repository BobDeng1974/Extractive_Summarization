a rescue kitten will undergo a life - threatening recovery surgery today after it underwent a routine microchip surgery last week that left him paralyzed			1
muffin , who was just six - weeks - old when @entity6 rescued him , was taken to @entity7 after being found wandering the streets of @entity9 last week			1
after taking muffin home from the shelter for routine medical microchip implantation , @entity6 made the horrifying realization that something went very wrong			1
they are meant to be implanted just below the surface of the skin and are not normally painful or invasive			2
they give each pet a personal identification number and even medical histry in the case that the pet is lost			0
@entity50 is often a required surgery for rescue pets and usually have little to no complications			0
@entity6 said that as soon as she took muffin home , his adorable little face started to dangle then crash towards the floor all together			2
she decided to get to the bottom of what was ailing her new pet after leaving the vet			0
an x-ray showed that a microchip that doctors implanted as part of the routine process had gotten lodged into the kitten 's spine. , @entity68			0
now the six - week - old muffin has to drag its entire left side when it moves			1
loved : @entity6 rescued six - week - old muffin from the harsh streets of @entity9 last week and wants her to be healthy and happy in her caring home immobilized : muffin can barely move and when she does , she must drag the left side of her body on the floor horrified : owner @entity6 says that thanks to generous donors , @entity5 might have a chance at recovery after a life - threatening surgery today to remove the chip x-ray : x-rays show that the chip went right through @entity5 's spinal cord causing debilitating paralysis ' i noticed after 30 minutes his head started to dangle and it started to kind of crash			1
on the x-ray it was clearly demonstrated that the microchip was inserted all the way into the spine			0
that ’s why he was paralyzed , ' @entity6 said			2
' i was in a total state of shock , ' @entity6 added			2
muffin has a surgery scheduled for today at the @entity105 where a neurologist will attempt to remove the chip			1
the surgery is very risky and @entity5 might die during or shortly after but @entity109 has no choice if she wants @entity5 to have a chance at surviving free of pain			1
@entity6 asked @entity114 to pay for the surgery since it was their doctor who implanted a microchip but they declined			1
' it ’s a highly risky procedure			0
he might die during the surgery and even a few days after the surgery			0
however , we need to do the surgery because the longer the microchip stays into the spine the more damage it can cause , ' @entity6 said			1
catastrophe : muffin was left paralyzed but if he survives today 's surgery he may have a change at a normal life the proof : @entity135 is investigating what may have went wrong during the surgery that left a poor kitten paralyzed with a microchip implanted in his spine hopeful : today 's surgery to remove the chip could help @entity5 lead a more normal life after becoming paralyzed the @entity9 @entity145 and @entity146 released a statement about their reasoning for not funding the surgery			1
' this was an anomaly			0
we acted in accordance with the manufacturer ’s guidelines in terms of whether the kitten should be micro chipped for its age and size			0
' we have never had an incident like this before			0
however , we are conducting an investigation and determining whether or not any corrections need to be made , ' they said			0
despite @entity9 @entity135 's lack of funding , @entity6 was able to raise money through caring donors on @entity169			1
they reached over their $ 5,000 goal			0
' @entity172 , @entity173 reached our goal ! ! ! ! ! we have left the fund raiser open , since once it is closed , we will be unable to update all of @entity5 's friends			2
no need to donate more ! we are overwhelmed by your generosity			0
because of you , @entity5 will get the finest care with the best surgical team			2
please keep @entity5 in your thoughts and prayers that he survives the surgery , and lives a long , healthy kitty life			1
thank you from the bottom of every rescuer 's heart , ' says the site			0
@entity6 promises to keep supporters updated on @entity5 's recovery .			1

six - week - old muffin was rescued from the streets of @entity9 by *animal* lover @entity6 last week
@entity6 took @entity5 to @entity7 where a veterinarian performed a botched microchip surgery last week that left @entity5 paralyzed
pet microchip surgery is a *typically* *non-invasive* chip - implantation surgery just below the surface of the skin that acts as an identifier
muffin has no choice but to undergo life - threatening surgery funded by generous donors to remove the chip today
