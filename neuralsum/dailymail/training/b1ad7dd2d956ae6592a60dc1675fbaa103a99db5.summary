from @entity0 as @entity1 to @entity2 as @entity3 , a tongue - in - cheek list of @entity6 ’ winners has been unveiled			1
the mocked - up winners ’ list , which was posted on @entity9 today , appears to have been prompted by @entity11 ’s surprise @entity13 award			1
the former prime minister picked up the gong for his efforts in ‘ establishing three charities ’ at the central @entity19 awards ceremony – much to the surprise of the star - studded audience which was said to be ‘ muted ’ as his name was read out			0
however , while the likes of @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 actually picked up awards – the dummy winners ’ list which emerged today appears to mock mr @entity11 ’s charity award			2
on receiving his honour at the @entity57 in @entity58 , the 61 - year - old , said : ‘ i would like to dedicate this award to the people that work with and for my organisations			0
i feel the pulse of progress beating a little harder			0
' he and his wife @entity67 have a property empire worth an estimated £ 30million , having bought homes for their children , and since stepping down from office in 2007 he has established three charities - the @entity72 , @entity73 and the @entity74			0
however , his recognition did n’t go down well across the country , with thousands taking to social media to question the award			2
@entity81 mp @entity80 said ‘ it sends the wrong message ’ , adding : ‘ this sort of award should go to an unsung hero who has given up their time for charity			1
’ former prime minister @entity11 picked up @entity13 award at last night 's @entity37 awards ceremony for his work in establishing three charities - much to the shock of the star - studded audience mr @entity11 's award was met with a wave of criticism on social media including this response from @entity101 others expressed their shock and questioned why the charity award was given to the former prime minister dozens of people referenced mr @entity11 's award on @entity9 overnight , with many surprised at his recognition and even @entity101 said : ‘ apparently , @entity11 has won @entity6 ’s philanthropist of the year award			1
finally these awards have grasped irony ! ’ the shock award , dubbed a pr stunt by many , appears to be the reason for the mocked - up winners ' list which was posted on @entity9 by @ @entity120 this morning			2
the photo - a digitally altered version of the leading magazine ’s actual winners ’ list - shows nine unlikely winners of some of @entity6 ’s biggest awards			2
the @entity129 is hailed @entity1 , @entity130 as @entity35 , @entity131 as @entity132 and @entity133 as @entity134			0
another image circulating on social media ( above ) shows mr @entity11 with his @entity6 award but has been digitally altered so the words ' the irony ' appear on the photo			1
one @entity9 user described it as the ' joke of the year ' the mocked - up tongue - in - cheek @entity6 winners ' list , posted on @entity9 today , names @entity145 president @entity0 ( left ) as @entity147 and @entity148 ’s @entity2 ( right ) as @entity3 it also awards @entity151 to disgraced @entity152 , @entity153 to fictional character @entity155 and @entity156 as @entity157			1
however , two of the most alarming ‘ winners ’ are @entity145 president @entity0 as @entity147 and @entity148 ’s @entity2 as @entity3			1
the mocked - up list has already been shared dozens of times on @entity9 , with one user – called @entity163 – jokingly adding : ‘ that ’s gon na put some pressure of the @entity167 prize list			0
’ the @entity37 awards ceremony is an annual event with gongs being dished out to high profile figures who have contributed in some way to society			0
last year , sir @entity175 , @entity176 and boxing champion @entity177 picked up awards			0
the awards are decided by a judging panel at the leading magazine , which is a monthly fashion and lifestyle publication for men owned by @entity185			0
