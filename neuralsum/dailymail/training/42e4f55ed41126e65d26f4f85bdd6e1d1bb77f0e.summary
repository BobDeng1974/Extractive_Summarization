the five tiny beach huts , all without a bathroom or mains electricity , sit on @entity12 , near @entity13 , @entity14 , which is so remote it can only be reached by ferry or a novelty train			1
but those looking to escape the stress of the city will need to have more than a little spare change			0
the huts are on the market for up to £ 240,000 - as much as a spacious family home in other parts of the country			1
at just 15ft by 10ft , the property costs the equivalent of £ 1,6000 per square foot - a similar rate to a beachfront mansion in exclusive @entity55 in nearby @entity56			2

@entity162 , from @entity73 , said january was a popular time of the year to sell the huts as , just as when booking holidays , would - be buyers often think about their summer plans now			1
he said : ' a million pounds does sound quite a lot just for five beach huts , but that does reflect how sought - after they are			1
it is not just a beach hut , it is a lifestyle you are buying into as well			0
' it 's a busy time of year for beach huts , people are starting to think about their summer plans			1
' it 's not that much different from travel companies starting to advertise their holidays now			0
it 's something that has snowballed over the last few years			0
' they do seem to be fetching around the £ 200,000 - mark now and there are rumours of them going higher than that			2
' it 's very difficult for us to value the huts , it 's governed a lot by location - whether you have that fabulous sea view - although some poeple prefer the harbour side , that 's got it 's own micro-climate			0
' but size and condition come into it too			0
' it seems like a lot of money but people are willing to pay that , even though they 've still got to rent the land from the council as well			0
' i think people just really want to be part of the community			0
it 's quite a rare thing			0
' some people will spend six weeks at their beach hut for the summer holidays , getting into that way of life			0
' it 's a beautiful part of the world and has some of the nicest beaches			0
it 's not an easy journey for the day so it tends to be quieter than @entity225 or @entity226			0
