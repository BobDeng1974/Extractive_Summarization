a flesh - eating plant that grew in @entity1 about 40 million years ago has been discovered by scientists			2
its fossilised leaves , preserved in @entity6 amber , are strewn with multi-cellular stalked glands and single cell hairs			1
the new species was dug out of a mine near @entity11 on the @entity6 and is believed to be related to the ' flypaper trap ' plant @entity13 , found in the southwestern @entity14			1
a flesh - eating plant that grew in @entity1 40 million years ago has been discovered by scientists			2
its fossilised leaves , preserved in @entity6 amber , are strewn with multi-cellular stalked glands and single cell hairs @entity13 catches small prey - largely insects - with its leaves that are covered in an extremely sticky glue produced by the glands or tentacles			1
like @entity13 , the @entity1 plant 's leaves show evidence of different sized tentacles with which it would have captured prey and smothered it in slime before releasing digestive enzymes			1
the tentacles , as well as the glands on the leaf surface , absorb the nutrients from the prey			2
describing the discovery in @entity38 , the researchers believe the fossils , dating back to 35 to 47 million years ago during the @entity41			0
they could represent early members of @entity13 's family called @entity45			1
pictured in a and b are the carnivorous leaf found preserved in @entity41 @entity6 amber			2
they look remarkabley similar to the leaves found in modern - day @entity51 ( c and @entity54 ) the tentacles , as well as the glands on the leaf surface , absorb the nutrients from the prey			1
pictured is a close up view of the tentacles in amber			0
scientists say this represent early members of @entity13 's family called @entity45			1
dr @entity64 , of @entity65 in @entity66 , said it is believed to be the first case of carnivorous plant traps being fossilised			2
' amber - fossil tree resin - preserves organisms in microscopic fidelity and frequently fossils preserved in amber are otherwise absent in the entire fossil record , ' she said			0
' plant remains however are rarely entrapped in amber , compared with the vast amount of insects and other animals			0
' our newly discovered fossils from @entity41 @entity6 amber are the only documented case of fossilized carnivorous plant traps and represent the first fossil evidence of the carnivorous plant family @entity45 , which is today a narrow endemic of @entity86			1
' scientists successfully revived moss that has lay frozen under @entity90 ice for more than 1,500 years earlier this year , scientists successfully revived moss that has lay frozen under @entity90 ice for more than 1,500 years			0
the discovery shows , for the first time , that plant life has the ability to survive millennium spanning ice ages			0
@entity99 has previously been known to weather extreme conditions for up to 20 years and is an important player in the eco-systems of both the @entity103			0
the research was jointly carried out by the @entity105 ( @entity105 ) and the @entity106 and involved sliced moss cores being taken from @entity90 permafrost and sprayed with distilled water by being kept in carefully monitored temperature and light conditions			0
after only a few weeks , the moss started to grow and carbon dating revealed that the plants were at least 1,530 years old			0
the results suggest the @entity45 's ancestors were spread more widely than thought			1
it also challenges previous ideas that the plant originated about 90 million years ago on the southern supercontinent @entity121 before @entity124 's landmass split into the pieces we see today			2
dr @entity64 said living @entity45 plants are very effective traps for all kinds of insects due to the sticky resinous trapping glue and the hierarchical organisation of the tentacles into functional units for effective prey capture			1
like @entity13 ( pictured ) , the @entity1 plant 's leaves show evidence of different sized tentacles with which it would have captured prey and smothered it in slime before releasing digestive enzymes ' the longest tentacles make the first contact with the prey			1
due to the high flexibility of these prominent tentacles the moving prey then gets stuck to the medium - sized tentacles which slow down the caught animal , ' she said			0
' finally the smallest and stiffest tentacles immobilise the prey			0
as in modern @entity45 the leaf fossils have different size classes of tentacles that fulfil the functional roles for prey capture - entanglement , slow - down and immobilization - and comply with the requirements for a carnivorous nature			0
' in addition the pore of the tentacle heads distinguishes the fossils from any other extant carnivorous plants with glandular adhesive traps such as sundews			0
' the new species was dug out of a mine near @entity11 on the @entity6 and is believed to be related to the ' flypaper trap ' plant @entity13 , found in the southwestern @entity14 of @entity86			1

new species was dug out of a mine near @entity11 on the @entity6
fossilised leaves had multi-cellular stalked glands and single cell hairs
leaves are covered in an extremely sticky glue produced by tentacles
it may be related to the ' flypaper trap ' plant @entity13 in @entity86
@entity13 's ancestors were spread more widely than thought
