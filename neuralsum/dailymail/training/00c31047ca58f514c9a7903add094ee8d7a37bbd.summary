concerns : @entity1 said @entity2 was ¿ in denial ¿ about growing levels of racial division @entity2 is turning into a ‘ colour - coded society ’ as whites and ethnic minorities choose to live apart , @entity6 warns today			1
the former head of the equalities watchdog said @entity2 was ‘ in denial ’ about growing levels of racial division resulting from the choices different groups make about where to live			1
mr @entity6 , who is now leading a research project at the think - tank demos , made his comments as he launched a study into how different ethnic groups have moved around @entity23 and @entity24			1
his study found that when whites leave urban areas to have children they tended to settle in overwhelmingly white areas in the countryside			0
at the same time , members of ethnic minorities tend to move to areas that are largely populated by other ethnic minority groups			0
this , the research suggests , is the result of not wanting to be ‘ ethnic pioneers ’ – the only minority people in white areas			1
mr @entity6 , the former chairman of the @entity39 , described this process as ‘ comfort zone segregation ’ and warned it would ‘ set communities against each other ’			1
he said : ‘ we ’ve been in denial on this issue for far too long			2
‘ this research reveals that we have yet to face up to the risk that we are drifting into a colour - coded society			2
‘ there ’s no doubt that today ’s @entity2 is way more at ease with ethnic and cultural difference than the country in which i grew up – nobody moves out of the street because i ’ve moved in			1
but ironically , the next generation ’s natural desire to do the right thing for their families is leading to a new kind of social division – what you might call comfort - zone segregation			0
‘ the consequences are to set communities against each other and to build educational and economic division into our society			1
‘ if we ’re going to halt the trend we first have to acknowledge it is taking place			0
’ the study , by @entity78 and @entity79 , surveyed the movements of different groups around the country between the censuses in 2001 and 2011			0
it found 100,000 ethnic minority people left @entity86 for other parts of @entity23 and @entity24 , but tended to avoid the 80 per cent of the country that is overwhelmingly white			0
instead they mainly moved to ‘ mixed ’ areas where there are already other established minority groups			2
segregated : members of the @entity95 community in @entity86 , the research shows that ethnic minority groups stick to diverse urban areas while the countryside remains overwhelmingly white @entity100 , by contrast , tended to move into mixed areas in @entity86 in their 20s , and move out when they start a family			0
some 600,000 whites left @entity86 for other parts of @entity23 and @entity24 over the same period , with many opting for ‘ homogeneous ’ areas that are more than 90 per cent white			2
the report said racial tolerance was not a factor in why people moved out or where they moved to , nor ethnic differences in wealth or income			0
instead , they said it was a result of ‘ cultural tastes ’ and ideals about what kind of neighbourhood they wanted to live in			2
professor @entity125 of @entity79 said : ‘ the @entity126 shows that since 2001 , white @entity2 people have left @entity86 and other diverse areas for more homogeneous parts of the country			1
‘ this is not exactly “ white flight ” – it seems as though they ’re influenced by friends and family as well as the neighbourhood ideals of their age group			0
‘ but that does n’t mean ethnicity is n’t important			0
‘ @entity2 ’s ethnic minorities have n’t caught the same fever for the countryside as white @entity2 over- 30s , which seems to be linked to their reluctance to be ethnic pioneers			1
