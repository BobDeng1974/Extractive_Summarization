with a stern face that never cracked into a smile unless he was looking at his ruthless young boss , @entity1 's top army chief has been purged from office in another demonstration of @entity8 's merciless rule			1
just 24 hours after it was reported that @entity8 had ordered the machine - gun execution of his former singer lover , @entity12 and 12 other entertainers , it was claimed today that hawkish army chief @entity14 , 75 , had been removed from his post , his future unknown			0
@entity1 watchers in the hated @entity18 said the sacking appeared to be an attempt by @entity8 , whose age is estimated to be about 30 , to bring unruly and ageing military leaders to heel			1
general @entity14 , right , stands with former @entity1 leader @entity23			1
although close to @entity8 , he has been removed from his post but his ruthlessness appears to be paying off in his own country - according to researchers at @entity28 , the dictator now has a higher approval rating then both @entity31 president @entity30 and @entity33 prime minister @entity32			1
@entity35 - based @entity1 analyst @entity34 , said yesterday that @entity8 had learned that he had to manage his dictatorship carefully if he wanted to stay in power			1
' he is replacing officers appointed by his father , @entity23 , with younger men who he hopes will now shore up his political power base			1
' @entity14 does not go without leaving an impressive record of aggression behind - he is credited with masterminding the torpedo sinking of the @entity45 ship , @entity46 , and the shelling of the south 's @entity48 , both incidents occurring in 2010			0
analysts said there was little doubt that @entity8 had been removed after studying a report in a @entity1 newspaper , the official @entity55 daily			2
a source in the @entity18 government said : ' we 're closely watching development in the @entity1 , believing that @entity14 has been replaced by @entity60 , the @entity62 's general staff chief of operations			0
' execution : @entity8 , pictured with his wife @entity66 ( left ) , also had @entity12 and 12 other entertainers killed the official said the @entity1 paper had mentioned @entity60 behind senior regime figures @entity71 and @entity72 in a report about @entity8 watching a soccer match alongside selected soldiers			2
it mentioned @entity60 before @entity77 , the minister of the @entity78 , but significantly there was no mention at all of @entity14 , who was always photographed at @entity8 's side			0
in addition , @entity60 was seen with a four - star insignia rather than the three stars he displayed earlier , denoting his less senior post			0
' @entity60 seems to have been promoted to chief of the @entity62 's general staff , because the chief of operations is never mentioned ahead of the @entity78 minister , ' said the source , quoted in @entity35 's authoritative @entity93 newspaper , which revealed the alleged execution of @entity8 's former lover			0
popular : @entity8 , seen applauding during the final of the @entity98 soccer tournament in this undated photo released by @entity1 's @entity100 , has higher approval ratings than @entity31 president @entity30 according to the paper , @entity14 's dismissal might have been discussed at a meeting of the @entity106 's @entity105 - chaired by none other than @entity8 - last weekend			1
@entity1 media reported that the meeting discussed ' organisational matters ' and noted that the leader made an ' important decision			2
' the leader 's ruthlessness has become apparent once again , because he held @entity14 in high esteem - yet still felt the need to remove him			0
analysts said it was possible that @entity8 hopes the removal of the general might improve relations with @entity18 and @entity122 - despite @entity123 already being an ally			0
in spite of his ruthlessness , @entity8 is still supported by the majority of his people , according to research by the @entity130 at @entity28			2
although not strictly accurate as they polled 133 @entity1 defectors , researchers found that 61.7 per cent of those asked thought that the dictator had the backing of the majority of his country			0
according to the @entity139 , the result not only makes him more popular than his predecessor and late father , but also @entity31 president @entity30 who has a 41 per cent approval rating and @entity33 prime minister @entity32 who is languishing on 38 per cent .			1
