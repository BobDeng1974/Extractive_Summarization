by @entity0 published : 11:20 est , 19 august 2013 updated : 02:42 est , 21 august 2013 a ninety - year - old @entity2 nun has been hailed as a musical genius after a concert pianist stumbled across her scribbled scores and decided to showcase them to the world			1
@entity9 - @entity8 has spent almost her entire life shut away in a convent , rarely ever venturing outside the stone walls of the @entity13 in @entity14 , where she lives			1
but despite her cloistered existence , she is now on the brink of global stardom after @entity20 classical musician @entity19 heard a rare cd of her work , and was so impressed that she turned it into a book			1
and on tuesday , @entity25 will hear her music played in concert for the first time in a series of recitals in @entity14 - and may even make a cameo performance			1
gifted : @entity9 - @entity8 has spent almost her entire life shut away in a convent kept company by her two passions - @entity35 and music ' it is classical music , with a very special sense of time , space , scenery , ' @entity19 told the @entity43			1
' it 's not grand ; it 's intimate , natural , honest and very feminine			1
she has a magical touch on the piano			0
it 's delicate but deep			0
and all her compositions tell stories of time and place			0
' @entity54 has spent the last 70 years penning a vast musical opus that has , until now , barely been heard outside the convent			1
instead it has been left to fade in plastic shopping bags tucked away in her cramped living quarters			0
' honest and very feminine ' : despite her cloistered existence , she is now on the brink of global stardom after @entity20 classical musician @entity19 ( pictured ) heard a rare cd of her work , and was so impressed that she turned it into a book despite there being only a handful of recordings of @entity54 's work , ms @entity19 first heard a sample when her husband brought back a cd he found in a @entity77 record shop			1
upon hearing the music , she immediately set out to track the nun down to find out what else she had composed			1
' we listened and were amazed by the strange combination of classical , @entity2 and blues , ' said @entity19			2
' and then we read the sleeve notes and discovered she lives right here in @entity14			2
' @entity25 began life as a member of the @entity2 aristocracy in @entity89 with close ties to emperor @entity91			0
born with the name @entity94 on december 12 1923 , she lived there until , at the age of six , she and her sister were sent to a @entity99 boarding school where she got her first taste of classical music			0
by her late teens she had been offered a place at a prestigious music school in @entity77			2
but , due to the turmoil that had spread across her homeland , she was denied to leave by the @entity2 authorities			0
in protest at her detention , she went on hunger strike until , nearing death , she turned to @entity35 and took her first @entity112			2
she gave up music and devoted herself to religion , moving to a remote monastery in northern @entity2 where she spent the next ten years living barefoot in a mud and stone hut			2
it was not until she rejoined her mother in @entity89 that she took up music again and soon recorded a handful of albums			0
in 1984 , after the death of her mother , she moved to @entity14 to take up residence at the @entity2 @entity13 where she has remained ever since			0
cloistered life : @entity54 has spent the last 70 years penning a vast musical opus that has , until now , barely been heard , left instead to fade in plastic shopping bags tucked away in her nunnery quarters in the convent ( pictured ) it was there that @entity19 tracked her down , sitting at her piano			1
after years of visits and silent bonding ( ' we felt there was a lot of longing and sorrow and loneliness ' ) , @entity133 finally persuaded her to hand over her work to turn into a book			2
' she handed over four plastic bags — old wrinkled @entity146 bags — containing hundreds of pages , all muddled up , a big mess , written in pencil , some of them 60 or 70 years old , ' @entity19 told the @entity43			1
' it was all the pages of her music that she had found in her room			0
" make a book " , she said			0
' enlisting the help of the @entity158 , which organises an annual summer festival of art , music and food in the city , @entity19 finally completed the painstaking task of organising and publishing the opus			1
musical ambiance : easter celebrations outside the @entity2 @entity168 in @entity14 , where @entity8 has lived since 1984 the book begins with a foreword from @entity171 , a regular visitor to @entity25			1
' i enter a darkened room and catch my first glimpse of her , an elderly woman , not a wrinkle on her face , lying in bed , ' @entity171 writes			0
' it is a modest room with a small window			0
in the room is a bed , a piano , piles of musical scores and a picture of @entity91 and the @entity188 hung above the papers			0
' @entity190 - @entity8 is in her own world ; she speaks slowly with an inner peace , her soothing voice caresses the listener and her infectious smile sneaks into the conversation every now and then [ ... ] ' the disparity between the room 's sparseness and @entity9 - @entity8 's spiritual richness reaches deep down into my soul			1
' the performance on tuesday will feature a host of professional musicians , led by @entity205 , play a selection of @entity25 's music			2
@entity25 is said to have found her new fame somewhat overwhelming and has spent most of her time locked in the nunnery , refusing media requests .			0

@entity9 - @entity8 rarely ever leaves convent in @entity14
but now on brink of global stardom after discovery by pianist @entity19
over 70 years she devoted life to @entity35 and piano , penning opus in *bedroom*
@entity19 found old recording in @entity77 music store and set out to find her
@entity19 has turned opus into book and organised concert for tuesday
she describes @entity54 's work as ' intimate , natural , honest and very feminine '
