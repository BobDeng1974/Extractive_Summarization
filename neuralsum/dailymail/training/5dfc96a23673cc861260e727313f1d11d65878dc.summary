one @entity2 fan , @entity32 wrote : ' is it me or has @entity4 become more @entity6 ? ' while @entity35 said : ' speaking of strong accents i had to turn the subtitles on when i was watching @entity2 because @entity4 is very @entity6			1
' after the critically acclaimed first episode aired on january 5 this year , some baffled viewers accused the actor of ' mumbling ' - to such an extent that they were struggling to understand parts of the plot			1
@entity13 said at the time that it had received ‘ fewer than five ’ complaints about mumbled dialogue			1
critically acclaimed : @entity4 , who plays dour detective inspector @entity8 , received wide - spread praise for his performance in the first series of the @entity13 crime show @entity35 claimed she had to turn subtitles on to help her understand some of the diaogue it is not the first time @entity2 has sparked debate on social media with some pointing to inaccuracies in legal proceedings one of the @entity25 users suggesting that this may be the result of a stronger @entity6 accent was @entity63 who wrote : ' has @entity4 gotten more @entity6 in the new series of @entity2 ? ' but @entity65 was just content to see the actor on screen , tweeting : ' i find it a little bit difficult to understand the @entity6 accent , but it 's @entity4 , so who cares ? ' an @entity13 spokesman this afternoon pointed out that @entity4 was @entity6 and merely speaking in his own accent ' as he usually would in every day life ' - and denied that it had changed in any way			1
it is not the first time @entity2 has sparked debate on social media			1
this morning , viewers accused scriptwriters of adding in an unrealistic scene - table service from @entity83 's			1
disgruntled viewers have complained that the latest episode of @entity13 's crime show @entity2 is unrealistic as it shows table service in fast food restaurant @entity89 disgruntled fans complained after @entity4 was seen in the latest episode of the show , set in @entity93 , ordering chicken from a waiter who appeared beside his table			1
at the @entity99 fast food chain , customers order their food at the till and pay at the same time			2
others have complained about the plot line , claiming there are a number of inaccuracies in the way legal proceedings have been portrayed elsewhere , mother @entity108 , played by @entity109 , prompted ridicule when she returned to court to witness the trial of @entity113 a short time after an easy water birth			2
@entity115 has requested a comment from mr @entity4 's representatives this afternoon			1
digging up @entity119 's corpse			2
what happened : @entity122 ’s parents @entity108 and @entity123 with prosecuting barrister @entity124 were horrified after @entity113 ’s defence team got @entity119 ’s body exhumed on the flimsiest of grounds and without the prior approval of his family			0
but retired detective @entity131 told the @entity132 : ‘ the body belongs to the coroner and in these circumstances no coroner would allow an exhumation			2
you would have to consult the family beforehand			0
the only reason not to is if the entire family were suspects in the case			0
’ use of spy cameras what happened : @entity8 installs a number of hidden cameras and tape recorders in the house of @entity150 - where a terrified @entity151 is finally persuaded to meet her former husband - in the hope of getting a confession from @entity155			1
@entity8 installs hidden cameras and tape recorders in the house of @entity150 , but any confession obtained through these would be inadmissible in court but @entity131 explains : ‘ i ’m afraid that any confession that is obtained through these means would be totally inadmissible in court			1
of course , if you suspect somebody of an offence , you must caution them and tell them they have a right to remain silent			0
’ the wrong wig what happened : @entity173 ( @entity174 ) is the judge in the case of @entity113 but the wig she wears is quite different from the short bench wig worn by a judge presiding over a trial in a criminal case			0
why @entity108 would never have been interrogated about her sex life what happened : the judge allows the defence barrister to question @entity119 ’s mother about her sex life and the affair her husband @entity123 had with a woman called @entity188 , even though it has no obvious connection to the murder			0
but criminal barrister @entity192 explains : ‘ the sort of questions that were being asked would not have been allowed			0
there is no relevance whatsoever			0
' could @entity108 and @entity123 really select their own criminal barrister ? what happened : @entity119 ’s grieving parents choose retired local lawyer @entity124 as their prosecution barrister			0
but legal expert @entity202 says : ‘ the whole thing about prosecutions is that they are brought by the state in the name of @entity208			0
@entity119 ’s grieving parents would never have been able to choose their own prosecution barrister in real life ‘ they are brought on behalf of society at large and the victim ’s family does not get to choose the barrister			0
’ witnesses ca n't stay to watch trial what happened : @entity119 ’s parents @entity108 and @entity123 , along with the local vicar are among the witnesses for both the prosecution and defence who are all allowed to sit in court and listen to each other as they give evidence			0
but @entity192 says : ‘ witnesses can not sit through any part of the proceedings , nor can they be told about what is occurring in court at any part			0
they should never have been in court			0
’ how come the new suspect turns up everywhere ? what happened : @entity237 ( @entity238 ) – who is the prime suspect in the @entity240 abductions – has displayed an uncanny habit of popping up on the horizon and throwing menacing glances at @entity8			1
but bemused viewers have wondered exactly how @entity237 has been able to track down @entity8 everywhere he goes so easily			1
@entity237 ( @entity238 ) , the prime suspect in the @entity240 abductions , has displayed an uncanny habit of popping up everywhere the newborn baby that can hold its head up at 24 hours old what happened : those who watched last night 's show criticised a storyline in which new mother @entity108 , played by @entity109 , returned to the courtroom just hours after a home water birth			2
viewers have pointed out that the baby then looked much too big to be a newborn and could even hold its head up at just 24 hours old			2
a one in 7,000 occurrence fans of the show have pointed out that it would be highly unlikely to see such a diverse courtroom - with a female @entity267 judge , a black woman defence counsel and a white female prosecution counsel			2
in 2010 , 35 % of barristers were women , and 10 % were from ethnic minorities			0
meanwhile in 2011 , 22 % of judges were women and 5 % were from ethnic minorities			0
that makes the diversity likelihood of the @entity2 trial a one in 7,000 occurrence .			2
