by @entity0 published : 05:37 est , 22 october 2012 updated : 07:16 est , 22 october 2012 @entity1 has threatened to ban @entity3 newspapers from its search engine if the country passes a law to make search engines pay for the right to use news articles online			1
the new law , dubbed the ' @entity1 law , ' has been spearheaded by @entity3 newspapers , and mirrors a similar law under consideration in @entity14			1
the owners of many @entity3 newspapers are in favor of the tax , believing their revenue and copyrights are compromised when @entity1 's search results display their content			1
@entity1 has threatened to remove @entity3 newspapers from its search engine if a new tax which would force them to pay to use content comes into force			1
@entity26 is a the search giant 's computer - generated news site			1
it aggregates headlines from news sources worldwide , groups similar stories together and displays them according to each reader 's personalized interests			0
@entity1 says stories on the system are ' selected and ranked by computers that evaluate , among other things , how often and on what sites a story appears online			2
' @entity3 's minister for high technology , @entity42 told @entity3 's @entity45 newspaper that the government is studying the idea and that ' @entity48 will be stronger if it can move ahead unified on that idea			0
' she was in @entity51 last week to speak with her counterpart about the proposals , a spokesman said			0
@entity3 culture minister @entity54 also recently told a parliamentary commission it is ' a tool that it seems important to me to develop			0
' however , @entity1 says that such a law would ' threaten its very existence , ' according to a letter it sent to several @entity3 officials and published online today			1
' there has been some interest around an extract from a note we have prepared about a proposal by @entity3 news publishers associations to require search engines to license all of the content that they help users to find across the web , ' said @entity75 , @entity1 's director of public policy in @entity3			1
' the web has led to an explosion of content creation , by both professional and citizen journalists			0
' so it 's not a secret that we think a law like the one proposed in @entity3 and @entity14 would be very damaging to the internet			1
' we have said so publicly for three years			0
' @entity1 said the move was ' detrimental to @entity3 users , innovation on the @entity89 and ultimately to the news publishers themselves			2
' however , the search giant said : ' we have always been and remain committed to collaborate with @entity3 publishers associations as they experiment and develop sustainable economic models on the @entity89			1
' @entity1 's representatives met in @entity95 with @entity42 , the @entity3 minister for small business , innovation and numeric economy , according to @entity98 , a spokesman for the @entity3 embassy in @entity100			2
@entity1 is also part of a lobbying group in @entity14 that opposes the proposed law there , as well , though the company has n't sent a similar position paper to the @entity14 government , a @entity1 spokesman said			1
@entity109 newspapers have boycotted @entity26 over the search engine 's refusal to pay for content the latest row comes as newspapers accounting for 90 per cent of the circulation in @entity109 have abandoned @entity26			1
@entity109 's @entity116 says all 154 members had followed its recommendation to ban the search engine aggregator from using their content			2
the papers say @entity26 refused to pay for content and was driving traffic away from their websites			2
@entity1 had previously said that the service boosted traffic to news websites			2
' staying with @entity26 was not helping us grow our digital audiences , ' said the association 's president , @entity130			0
' by providing the first few lines of our stories to @entity89 users , the service reduces the chances that they will look at the entire story in our websites , ' he said in an interview with the @entity142			0
the @entity116 of newspapers , known by its @entity146 acronym @entity144 , carried out an experiment with @entity1 that began in december 2010			0
this allowed @entity26 to carry the top line of news stories to raise curiosity and get readers to click on the full story on the newspapers ' sites			0
however , @entity144 says that the experiment has failed			0
among the 154 titles that have pulled out from @entity26 are some of the country 's most important news sites such as @entity160 and @entity161			0
at a recent meeting of the @entity163 in @entity161 , @entity1 defended its decision not to pay for the headlines from news websites			1
' @entity26 channels a billion clicks to news sites around the world , ' said @entity1 's @entity172 director @entity171			0
@entity109 's newspaper association said that despite leaving @entity26 , many of the news organisations ' internet portals will still be listed by the aggregator			0
internet users using @entity1 — but not @entity26 — will still be able to find content from most newspapers ' sites , said @entity144 .			1

*disagreement* over so - called ' @entity1 tax ' which would force the search giant to pay to use newspaper content
similar law has been proposed in @entity14
