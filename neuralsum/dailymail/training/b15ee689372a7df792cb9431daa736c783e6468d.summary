by @entity0 published : 01:17 est , 12 december 2013 updated : 01:30 est , 12 december 2013 gay couples who wed less than a week ago have had their marriages annulled after @entity4 's highest court struck down a law allowing the nation 's first same - sex unions			1
the weddings were legalised in the capital @entity10 on saturday after regional authorities enacted a gay marriage law - but it was challenged by the government , which said it was invalid			1
today the @entity15 of @entity4 agreed , shattering the dreams of more than a dozen couples who had already married this week			0
tearful : activist @entity19 with couples outside the @entity15 after a gay marriage law was struck down today			1
he said : ' marriage equality is not about protest or politics ... it 's about love ' devastated : @entity26 and @entity27 had their wedding , pictured , on saturday			1
it will now be annulled @entity31 and @entity32 , pictured with their marriage certificate , had wed only days before the historic ruling this couple , named as @entity37 and @entity38 , was one of dozens who attended the @entity15 ruling today @entity4 's prime minister is against gay marriage and the national @entity45 was amended in 2004 to define weddings as ' between a man and a woman '			2
the government told the @entity15 that having different marriage laws in different states would cause confusion			0
the @entity53 , which passed the law in october , said it should stand because it governs couples outside the federal definition of marriage as being between members of the opposite sex			2
today the court sided with the government , saying the two laws could not run side - by - side			2
@entity27 , who married his partner @entity26 on saturday , had only received their marriage certificate on wednesday and had already applied to change their surnames to @entity68			0
outside court he said he will always consider @entity26 his husband and added : ' this was an unprecedented and historic opportunity			0
i would n't have missed it for the world			0
' upset : a couple hug outside the court			0
@entity53 prime minister @entity77 is against same - sex unions emotion : couples embrace each other after the ruling , which defeated a regional law made in @entity53 @entity31 and @entity32 embraced as couples faced the media today outside the @entity15 of @entity4 the court said in a statement : ' @entity89 does not now provide for the formation or recognition of marriage between same sex couples			1
the @entity45 provides that a marriage can be solemnised in @entity4 only between a man and a woman			0
' that act is a comprehensive and exhaustive statement of the law of marriage			0
' @entity19 , national director of the advocacy group @entity101 , said his group knows of about 30 same - sex couples who have married since saturday , though the actual number may be slightly higher			0
conservative : @entity53 prime minister @entity77 is against gay marriage and blocked two bills the court decision nullifies their marriages as it means the local law under which they were wed was invalid			1
outside the court in @entity10 , a tearful @entity19 , flanked by several same - sex newlyweds , said the ruling was a defeat for marriage equality but there had been a ' greater victory '			1
' that victory was the nation saw for the first time , i believe , what is really at the core of this issue , ' he said			0
' they 've seen that marriage equality is not about protest or politics or even about laws in the constitution , ultimately			1
marriage equality is about love , commitment , family and fairness			1
' the ruling has effectively barred any other @entity53 states from legalising same - sex marriage , and the decision can now only be taken by the government			0
however , prime minister @entity77 opposes gay marriage and his coalition blocked two federal bills last year that would have allowed legal recognition of same - sex partnerships			2
@entity149 , managing director of @entity150 , which opposes same - sex marriage , praised the court ruling and said common sense had prevailed			2
as for the ruling 's impact on the newlywed couples , @entity149 said it was ' really sad that they were put in a position ' in which they were allowed to marry before the court handed down its judgment			2
the ruling comes a day after @entity165 's @entity164 struck down a 2009 lower court decision to decriminalize homosexuality			1
the verdict to reinstate gay sex as an ' unnatural act ' as part of a 153 - year - old colonial law prompted dismay from human rights groups across the world , which condemned the ruling as ' medieval and regressive '			1
homosexual acts in @entity165 , in many parts a deeply conservative country , are punishable with life in jail .			0

more than 20 couples had already wed and will have marriages annulled
activist : ' marriage equality is not about protest or politics ... it 's about love '
