@entity1 ’s seven - game winning streak does not include @entity2			1
@entity3 , but not @entity2			1
@entity4 , but not @entity2			2
@entity5 and @entity6 , but not @entity2			2
so the idea that the heat has been taken out of @entity10 ’s full debut for his country by a string of victories since last summer ’s @entity14 does rather overlook a salient fact			2
that @entity1 ’s seven wins , as welcome as they may be , are against the also - rans of @entity18 football			1
only @entity4 are on course to qualify automatically for the @entity23 at the halfway stage — by coming a distant second to @entity1 — while @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 are in third place in their respective groups , @entity3 lie fourth , @entity6 fifth and @entity5 where they always are			1
this is not @entity34 ’s fault			2
his players can only beat what is in front of them			0
@entity38 striker @entity10 is set to make his full @entity1 debut against @entity2 on tuesday night @entity10 celebrates after scoring on his @entity1 debut against @entity3 just 79 seconds after coming on @entity10 looks on as @entity1 manager @entity34 talks to members of the squad at the @entity43 yet just as @entity34 is trying to play down the clamour around @entity10 , playing down the euphoria around @entity1 ’s present run may be equally wise			1
it is not a year since @entity1 ’s poorest @entity14 finals performance in recent memory and what we do know is that when a group of players that are the scourge of the @entity56 nations plus an odd mountain range or two came up against @entity2 in @entity58 last june , they did not have the wit to win			1
that is where @entity10 comes in			0
@entity2 and @entity1 may be depleted in @entity62 , but certain standards remain			1
@entity2 ’s defence will be of a calibre @entity1 have not experienced since the @entity14			1
their ambition will be greater than that of previous opponents , too			0
the @entity38 striker headed in against @entity3 shortly after coming on as a substitute at @entity70 @entity10 celebrates his first international goal as @entity1 cruised to a 4 - 0 win over lowly @entity73 this is a genuine test for @entity10 , in a way his cameo role against @entity3 was n’t			1
he will not have played against a team of @entity3 ’s standard since he was being farmed out by his club on loan to gain experience			0
@entity3 fielded a starting back four featuring players from @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86 of @entity87			0
on tuesday , he will play against two of the men who have powered @entity90 to the pinnacle of @entity93 football — @entity94 and @entity95 — plus @entity96 of @entity97			0
and that is what @entity1 require of @entity10 , too : an upgrade			1
@entity34 knows he already has the players to qualify for a major tournament — but he did n’t have ones who could muscle past @entity2 or @entity106 once there			1
the hope is @entity10 could change that			0
@entity10 will come up against @entity2 and @entity90 defender @entity95 ( left ) on tuesday night @entity94 ( second right ) , pictured with his @entity2 team - mates , will also come up against the @entity1 man @entity2 players train at the @entity43 in @entity62 ahead of tuesday 's friendly against @entity1 at the moment we are left asking questions to which we probably know the answer			1
why is @entity116 so prolific for @entity1 — @entity118 ’s top scorer in the current qualifying campaign , no less — yet still finding his feet with @entity121 ? why is @entity123 ’s form so inconsistent for @entity124 , yet so vital for @entity1 ? the explanation can be found in that @entity127 back four			2
when does @entity116 get to play against defenders at the level of the @entity130 with @entity121 ? when does @entity123 face opposition such as @entity86 ? @entity116 , top scorer in @entity23 qualifying , celebrates with @entity133 after scoring on friday night @entity123 comes up against better quality opposition for @entity124 than when playing for @entity1 @entity135 send their promising youth - team players to @entity137 on loan , and they often make the first team			1
@entity137 are currently fifth in the @entity140 ; @entity86 are 10th			0
the last time they met , on february 4 , two @entity135 players featured for @entity137 , who won 2 - 0			0
so that is what @entity116 and @entity1 were up against on friday — defenders who might not quite be at the level of @entity135 ’s best youngsters			2
faced with @entity148 in the @entity149 , different rules apply			0
yet against @entity148 on january 1 , @entity10 nhad one of his best games of the season			0
@entity10 had one of his best games of the season against @entity148 during @entity38 ' 5 - 3 win over @entity135 he is @entity157 football ’s top scorer playing often against players with the quality we shall witness on tuesday night			1
what @entity34 must be hoping is that in @entity62 he sees a player who can take @entity1 beyond			2
@entity133 was @entity118 ’s top scorer on the way to @entity164 in 2010 , too			0
having qualified , @entity1 failed to attain the necessary level when competing in the finals			0
@entity34 talked of @entity10 on monday as a squad player being given the chance to show what he can do — albeit with one of his most promising lines of supply severed as @entity123 is back on @entity173 nursing a minor injury			2
yet he is more than just that			0
if @entity10 demonstrates that he can pose a genuine threat to high - level defenders , he has the capability to change the way @entity1 approach matches			1
the @entity149 's top scorer will be up against defenders of real quality when @entity1 take on @entity2 @entity116 does a job for @entity34 , but that is what it is : a job			1
it is a good job — he is the player @entity34 relies upon when he is concerned the opposition has superior technique — but it has limitations			0
@entity116 works hard , he closes down , he has pace on the counter-attack — and he does exactly what the manager asks of him			0
and , for now , that is enough			0
@entity116 has been prolific as @entity1 power through the mediocrities			0
@entity116 does a good job and is often relied on by @entity34 when @entity1 face sides with superior technique @entity202 is needed in @entity203 in 2016 , however , if @entity1 are to be more than just present			2
@entity34 must discover match - winners , players who have the beating of contenders like @entity2			1
so tuesday night is much more than a friendly for @entity10			1
this is a moment when he has the opportunity to alter the potential of @entity157 football and , if successful , we should n’t be frightened to embrace this .			0

@entity34 has *confirmed* @entity10 will start for @entity1 against @entity2
@entity10 scored first international goal on debut against @entity3 on friday
@entity1 's recent winning streak has come against @entity118 's also - rans
