they are often an embarrassing topic that leaves many people unwilling to talk about them , let alone own up to having one			0
but analysis of popular search terms on @entity6 has revealed the areas around the world that seem to be most concerned with sexually transmitted diseases			1
by far , the most searched for term globally is @entity11 and @entity12 , followed by herpes and then @entity14 ( @entity14 ) which can cause cervical cancer			2
the map above shows the countries in @entity18 with the highest and second highest number of searches per capita for different sexually transmitted diseases			1
the data was gathered using @entity23 in the @entity25 , chlamydia seemed to cause most concern , and is incidentally the most commonly diagnosed std in the country according to official figures			1
however , in the @entity31 herpes was the most searched for term across the country , with @entity34 being the state with the most searches for the virus			1
in @entity18 , @entity37 came out as what the maps called a ' herpes hotspot ' generating the most searches per capita , followed by @entity42			1
@entity43 seemed to be the most concerned about gonorrhea , while people in @entity46 were the biggest group searching for information about chlamydia			2
a study has discovered one in ten @entity31 think @entity51 - the name given to the code that makes up websites - is a sexually transmitted disease , while almost a third think a gigabyte is an insect			1
the research was carried out to determine how knowledgeable people are when it comes to tech terms , and how important they think tech is			0
@entity62 â€™s study asked 2,392 men and women aged over 18 to identify the meanings of a variety of words			0
these words were a mix of technical and non-technical terms , and each term was given with three multiple choice answers			0
@entity73 was the centre for the most searches about syphilis in @entity18 , while @entity77 were the hotspot for @entity14			2
@entity79 had the most searches for @entity12			0
in the @entity31 , @entity81 came out as the capital for gonorrhea , syphilis and chlamydia searches			1
while the data may reflect merely concern about the diseases , and so will in some cases highlight the most health conscious countries and states , it can also help to shed some light on where the incidence of stds are highest			2
@entity81 has the highest rates of chlamydia and gonorrhea of all the 50 states in the @entity31 , for example			1
@entity103 was found to be the hotspot for searches about @entity14 while the @entity106 was the area that searched most for information about hiv / aids			2
it also has the highest hiv / aids rates in the country			0
monitoring the spread of @entity113 is notoriously difficult due to the stigma that often surrounds them , which makes people reluctant to be tested or admit to infections			0
the analysis of @entity113 web searches was conducted by @entity122 's online doctor service which offers medical support and advice over the internet			0
the map above shows the states where the highest and second highest number of searches for @entity113 the data showed that most worldwide @entity6 searches are about hiv / aids closely followed by herpes @entity134 and gential warts attracted the most searches in the @entity25 in the past year , while in the @entity31 internet users seemed to be most concerned about herpes followed by chlamydia , as the graph above reveals it said the searches seemed to reflect some of the underlying trends in the spread of stds and treatment for them			1
for example , antibiotic - resistant gonorrhea has spread from east @entity149 to @entity18 over the past decade , which may explain why @entity43 shows the most searches for this condition			2
@entity73 has also seen an increase in syphilis cases since 2010 , including congenital syphilis transmitted from mother to child			0
this graph and map shows the areas of the @entity25 and @entity31 where herpes was searched for most , and how searches have changed in both countries over time			1
a spike in searches in both countries can be seen at the time when @entity167 announced it had discovered potential new treatment for herpes in 2009 the graph and map above show the hotspots in the @entity31 and the @entity25 for searches about syphilis			1
it also shows that searches for the condition appear to be rising in both countries after falling slightly around 2009 many people may also be turning to the internet to find out information about @entity113 's due to inadequate levels of support in the healthcare systems of their countries			0
in @entity79 , for example , which had the highest number of searches per capita for @entity12 , just 2 per cent of healthcare clinics provide screening for @entity11			0
@entity190 , which had the second highest number of searches for @entity11 , is suffering one of the worst @entity12 epidemics in @entity18			2
the research also examined searches for sexual dysfunction related terms and found that perhaps surprisingly , @entity198 came out as the capital for searches about the problem , along with premature ejaculation			0
gonorrhea hotspots in the @entity25 and @entity31 are shown in the map above while the graph also shows that searches for the term are increasing , although the data may be affected by searches for the name of a pop song by @entity212 released in september 2010 searches for @entity11 in the @entity31 and @entity25 appear to be on the decline , although @entity215 came out as the hotspot where in the @entity25 where most people searched for information , while @entity219 came top in the @entity31 searches for information about chlamydia seem to be increasing dramatically in recent years			1
@entity223 and @entity224 come out as the cities where most people in the @entity25 and @entity31 are searching about the diseease @entity227 was the state with most searches about erectile dysfunction and @entity230 had the most searches for premature ejaculation			1
people in the @entity25 and @entity234 both seemed to search most for @entity235 , while in the @entity31 , @entity236 was the state with most searches for the drug			1
a spokesman for @entity122 's online doctor said : ' sexual topics can be a difficult subject for anyone to discuss , especially when it comes to diseases and sexual dysfunctions			0
