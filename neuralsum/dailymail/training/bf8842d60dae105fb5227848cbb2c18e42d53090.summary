photographer and lawyer @entity9 captured these colourful images when he and his wife visited the @entity12 in @entity13 and he believes that at 10,500 square kilometres , the world 's largest salt plain is one of the most beautiful places on earth			1
here , at 12,000ft , a couple of centimetres of water covers the plain but sits perfectly still in the remote plain because there is no wind			0
and the stillness of the atmosphere allows the stunning skies to be mirrored perfectly in the water			2
@entity9 , 29 , from @entity33 in @entity34 , @entity35 , said : ' although it may look like a beach , they are rather an expansive salt flat covered in about a couple centimetres of water for as far as the eye can see			1
walking to heaven : this tranquil images captures reflections of the beautiful red @entity13 sky in an area of the country which is off the beaten track @entity49 practices yoga on the @entity13 salt flats in this image captured by her husband @entity9 paradise : the reflections of the clouds and people in these images give them an ' other - worldly ' feel			1
the silhouettes appear to be hovering in the air this image could be mistaken for an @entity63 snow scene , but it was actually taken on salt flats in @entity13 ' the altiplano is an extremely arid area , but rain and snow - melt often result in shallow water covering the @entity12 salt flat for a short time each year			1
' when the wind is calm and the @entity75 is filled with water , the result is one of the most otherworldly dreamscape imaginable			0
' i was lucky enough to have fantastic cloud formations as well			0
the sky appears to set alight in this reflective image of a sunset over salt flats in @entity13 this dreamlike image appears to show an island , but the stillness of the atmosphere creates a a beautiful reflection of the cloudy sky ' the @entity12 is a very special place			1
these photos remind me that unimaginably beautiful places exist in this world and i get this feeling of awe			0
' according to @entity9 , the @entity12 is ' out - of - the - way ' for almost everyone			1
it is most often reached by travellers who take an overnight bus from @entity100 in @entity13 along remote and often bumpy dirt roads			2
in a couple of the photos , his wife can be seen practicing yoga , while in others people are simply admiring the scenery			2
@entity9 said : ' i think the landscape depicted in these photographs is so clear because the @entity110 is far from any cities			2
' with an elevation of 12,000 ft , the air is thin and unadulterated by pollution			0
' the @entity12 is a rather popular attraction for people visiting @entity13 but its remote location makes any visit an inconvenient and time - consuming endeavor			1
photographer mr @entity9 said : ' these photos remind me that unimaginably beautiful places exist in this world and i get this feeling of awe			1
' ' the staging town for the @entity13 @entity110 is @entity127 , a small and unattractive community full of tour operators peddling the exact same tour			2
' the town of @entity12 is a couple hours from the salt flats and the only accommodation on the salt flats is a small and basic " salt hotel "			1
' the hotel is amazing because it is literally made of salt , including all the furniture			0
' almost all tours visit this salt hotel at the exact same time for only a couple hours each day and then leave well before sunset			0
' the fortunate few who stay at the salt hotel have the entire @entity75 and its sunset and sunrise to themselves			0
' however , staying at the salt hotel is not easy - it took my group a great deal of research and perseverance to convince a tour operator to customise a tour so that we could stay there			2
' our time on the @entity12 was absolutely a highlight of our time in @entity13			0
' having said that , i was definitely done with salt after just one night - it gets in your every pore and saturates into your shoes and clothes			0
' clouds appear like islands in the reflective stillness of this beautiful image , as mr @entity9 's wife @entity14 practices yoga			1
