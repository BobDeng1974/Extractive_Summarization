by @entity0 tragic : flt lt @entity1 , 35 , died on the runway at @entity3 near @entity4 in 2011 because of a defective ejector seat a @entity8 pilot who died when his ejector seat went off unexpectedly was failed by a manufacturer who knew it was defective for more than 20 years but did not tell the @entity12 , a coroner said today			1
flight lieutenant @entity1 's seat 's firing handle was in the wrong position when the airman entered the cockpit , and went off while he was on the ground			1
the @entity20 veteran was hurled up to 300ft into the air before plunging to the ground at the @entity12 aerobatics team 's base at @entity3 , near @entity4			1
following a three - week inquest , @entity26 coroner @entity25 recorded a narrative verdict and said : ' there was a very serious failure of communication by @entity32 ( the manufacturer ) in my view '			1
mr @entity25 described a safety pin that goes through the firing handle as ' entirely useless ' and said its presence was ' likely to mislead '			0
' the seat 's designer and manufacturers had failed to appreciate the consequent risk of incorrect pin provision , ' he said			2
@entity12 personnel missed 19 chances to spot that the ejection seat was in an unsafe position and the pin was incorrectly housed , the inquest heard			1
the coroner also said that @entity32 was aware of issues with the over-tightening of crucial nuts and bolts in the mechanism of the seat which would cause the main parachute not to deploy properly			1
however despite being aware of these issues since 1990 , @entity32 failed to pass on the warnings to the @entity61 , the coroner said			1
when flight lieutenant @entity1 was fired into the air but the main parachute on the @entity65 @entity32 seat , which should have saved his life , failed to deploy and he suffered multiple injuries			1
the inquest has heard that to trigger the 1960s ejection seat pilots must pull the firing handle - fitted between their legs - sharply upwards			2
but tests since the tragedy revealed that if the handle was ' locked ' in a certain position , a slight downward pressure would unexpectedly launch the ejection seat			2
damage : the jet pictured on the tarmac at @entity3 after the ejector seat had fired hero : comrades carry flight lieutenant @entity83 at his funeral , who was shot 300ft into the air and his parachute failed to deploy , leaving him fatally injured the coroner said : ' automatic separation from the ejection seat and main parachute deployment failed to occur			1
' very shortly thereafter and when still retained in seat there followed a high - velocity impact with the ground from which he suffered no survivable injuries '			0
the coroner said flt lt @entity83 's fatal injuries were suffered as a result of his impact on the ground			1
lawyers acting for the family today confirmed it had secured an undisclosed settlement from the @entity61 in december 2013 following a full admission of liability for the incident in july that year			0
bereft : @entity1 's family paid tribute to him today but admitted it was difficult to accept the manner in which he died in 2011 speaking after the verdict , flt lt @entity83 's father @entity116 said : ' our son @entity1 died aged 35 doing what he loved , which was flying with the @entity8			1
from the age of 17 , he had wanted nothing more than to join the @entity12 and serve his country , which he did with utmost pride and sense of duty			0
' he served a number of tours in @entity20 flying @entity130 in close air support of coalition forces			0
' @entity1 's death was a tragedy which we hope the evidence revealed in this inquest will help to avoid in the future			2
' we are very grateful to the coroner , mr @entity25 , for allowing a full exploration of how this tragic death occurred			0
' we still find it difficult to accept that so many people could have missed , between @entity1 's last sortie on friday and the following tuesday , what should have been obvious to those having a duty to ensure the safety of the seat , and we remain unconvinced as to that aspect of the coroner 's finding			1
' nevertheless , we accept that how the seat firing handle came to be in a position where it could be inadvertently activated may never be fully understood			0
' we welcome the conclusions of the coroner , which confirm what we knew all along , which is that @entity1 was blameless and his tragic death was preventable			2
we therefore welcome the coroner 's recommendations , which we hope and pray will ensure that no family such as ours has to endure such a pointless and avoidable death '			0
in a statement released after the hearing today , air commodore @entity165 , speaking on behalf of the @entity61 , said : ' the tragic loss of flight lieutenant @entity1 is still keenly felt by the @entity12 , the @entity8 and all of @entity1 's former colleagues			2
' @entity1 had an enthusiasm for flying and life that endeared him to all			0
his tragic accident has been a shattering blow to everyone on the team in particular			0
' now that the inquest into this tragic event has concluded it is time to reflect on what a wonderful man and pilot @entity1 was			0
we were extremely privileged to have known him and to have had him within our ranks			0
