by @entity0 @entity1 is the young @entity2 defender being chased by @entity3 and @entity4			1
@entity6 boss @entity5 has had an £ 8million bid rejected with the @entity8 holding out for £ 12m			1
@entity9 takes a closer peek at the player whose career path is very much on the up			2
who is he and what position does he play ? @entity1 was born on the april 24 , 1993 and is a @entity16 left back who came through @entity2 ’s youth system to become a regular first - team starter			1
exciting prospect : @entity1 has already played 84 times for @entity2 despite only turning 21 in april no nonsense : @entity1 is a tough tackler as well as providing an attacking threat from left back what ’s all the fuss about , then ? @entity1 , 21 , is best known amongst the @entity2 fans for his consistency			1
they could count the mistakes he ’s made on one hand and , in playing 43 games for them last season , he showed no signs of burnout			0
he is calm and composed on the ball and a threat going forward			0
so he ’s another @entity39 ? he ’s very similar			0
@entity1 , like @entity39 , came through the ranks at his first club to become a regular starter and has international experience with @entity44 as well			0
@entity1 is an attacking full back , too , but has scored three goals while @entity39 is yet to register a senior strike			1
@entity1 ' passing accuracy is much better than @entity39 's at 83 per cent compared with 70 per cent			2
he has the ability to become a centre back later in his career , according to former @entity2 manager @entity52			2
@entity39 thing : @entity1 has been compared to @entity54 and @entity55 left back @entity39 goal threat : @entity1 nets against @entity57 in the @entity58 back in september 2013 @entity2 want £ 12m for him			1
is he worth it ? if @entity39 is worth £ 30m , then why not ? he ’s experienced for his age and has played in @entity61 seven times			0
@entity63 can also boast @entity65 success in 2013 ... what a bargain ! is he leaving ? possibly			0
he ’s a @entity2 fan , so he obviously has emotional ties to the club and @entity70 seems reluctant to let him go , but if his price tag is met we could see him in @entity3 colours by september			1
do @entity3 even need another left back ? yes , desperately			1
with only @entity74 and @entity75 at their disposal to play there @entity3 have no time to lose this summer			0
they have also expressed interest in @entity80 's @entity79 and @entity82 's @entity81 , but @entity1 would be an important addition to @entity5 ' squad			2
capped up : the @entity2 man - seen here celebrating with @entity86 - has already played 10 times for @entity44			0

@entity2 's @entity1 a *transfer* target for @entity3 and @entity4
@entity3 have had £ 8m bid rejected as @entity2 hold out for £ 12m
