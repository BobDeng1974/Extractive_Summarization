a stone with unusual carvings that was sold as a garden ornament could contain a hidden message			1
plucked from a garden in @entity6 , the stone was purchased by an archaeologist who believes the intricate pattern was probably carved in @entity9 times , over 1,000 years ago			1
@entity10 , who is also a television presenter , said that the pattern ‘ may be some form of writing , ’ although there are so far no suggestions about what the ' text ' or shapes may mean			1
it is believed that the sandstone block was discovered several years ago and someone thought it would make an interesting decorative feature in the garden			1
mr @entity10 found the stone while he was looking for interesting stone carvings to buy on an auction website			1
' i came across the carved stone block that was up for sale as an " unusual garden ornament , " he told @entity40			1
' as i immediately recognised just how important it could prove to be i just had to purchase it to save it from ending up in another garden or even thrown away at worst			1
' at the time it was dirty , covered in moss and a lot of the carved pattern was not clearly visible			1
' when i finally received the stone i was shocked as it seemed far more important than i had first thought - and after gentle cleaning the true extent of the carving became clear			1
it weighs around 60lbs ( 27kg ) and is wider at the base than at the top			0
the ‘ ornament ’ caught mr @entity10 ’s eye because of its unusual shape and upon closer inspection , he noticed the carving			1
he told @entity60 : ‘ it 's possible the ‘ pattern carved may be some form of writing ’			1
the relief work does not resemble any known text , however , but the shape and style of the rock is typical of @entity9 monumental art. he told @entity40 : ' regarding the carvings on the stone my initial feeling is that these are symbols rather than straightforward text			1
' there is a great deal of further research to be done in the coming weeks and months			0
' mr @entity10 suggested that the stone could be ‘ a keystone from an archway or indeed a vaulted ceiling			1
’ he also tweeted that the stone could be the base of a cross or a tombstone			1
the hand - carved rock is 18 inches ( 46cm ) tall and 5.5 inches ( 14cm ) thick			2
the ‘ ornament ’ caught mr @entity10 ’s eye because of its unusual shape and upon closer inspection , he noticed the carving ( pictured )			2
it could be part of an archway or be the an archway or indeed a vaulted ceiling @entity10 ( pictured on the right with @entity97 ) said that the pattern ‘ may be some form of writing , ’ although there are so far no suggestions of what the ‘ text ’ may mean in 2009 , a garden ornament that had been sitting on a patio for 20 years turned out to be a 3,000 - year - old ancient @entity108 jar			1
the 13inch - high vessel was made during the time of the pharaohs to hold the organs of the dead ready for the afterlife			0
with a distinctive top in the style of a face and easily recognisable headdress , the @entity116 funerary jar had blended into its surroundings in an @entity123 garden for two decades			2
the terracotta jar with the top shaped with the face of the god @entity127 was built to hold a human liver			0
the goddess @entity130 would have protected it			0
dating from the @entity133 - 1550 - 1069 bc - the brown - coloured jar would once have been a painted receptacle fit for a pyramid			0
the owner of the jar , from @entity138 , explained : ' it came from an uncle who was a bit of a collector and when he died about 20 years ago it came to us			0
' we did n't know what it was and we have kept it on the patio and in the shed over the years			0
' it was just used as a decorative piece , a lump of stone			2
' then i looked at it and saw it had a face and it looked a bit @entity108 so we took it in to be valued and was told it was from ancient @entity108			0
' it was a great surprise that something that had been sitting there for some time unrecognised turned out to be so old			0
' the unusual stone is only decorated on one side , although there are chisel marks on other faces			2
mr @entity10 believes the stone dates to the @entity172 period , which stretched between 410 and @entity173			2
the period is known for its intricate patterns , which appeared on buildings and jewellery , for example , as well as written literature such as the poem beowulf			2
however , the date is only a guess and he has asked his @entity183 followers for help in learning more about the mysterious stone			2
he tweeted : ' any help welcomed in identifying this carved stone recently recovered , is is @entity188 or earlier ? ? ? ' restoring the block to its original state has been a labour of love and mr @entity10 has gently removed paint applied to the stone			1
he said : ' [ it ’s ] one of my best finds ever '			0
on his @entity198 page , he added that the stone could ' prove to be of major importance in the story of @entity202			2
