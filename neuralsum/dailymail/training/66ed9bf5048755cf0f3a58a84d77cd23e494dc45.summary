by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 believes @entity3 are a long way from a return to their glory days , although is convinced they are at least on the right track			1
with eight races of the season remaining , starting this sunday with the @entity10 @entity9 at @entity11 as @entity13 returns from its summer break , @entity3 find themselves in the unaccustomed position of sixth in the constructors ' championship			1
you have to go back to 1981 for when @entity3 last finished a season in such a position , while it is now 21 months and 30 races since the team 's last victory , their worst winless streak for 17 years			1
back on track : @entity2 believes that @entity3 are on a return to glory that is not what group chief executive @entity33 envisaged at the start of the year when he firmly suggested @entity3 would win again			1
for @entity2 , from the high of finishing second on his debut in @entity39 , the remainder of the year has been a struggle for the rookie			1
yet the 21 - year - old @entity43 has every confidence if the team continue along the path they have been treading , they will again be back at the front			0
' we 're still some way off where we should be , which is @entity3 dominating @entity13 , ' said @entity2			1
' but we just need to keep doing what we 're doing at the moment , which is staying strong , positive and patient			0
' for me , i 'm on a very steep learning curve , a process of development as a @entity13 driver			0
' the goal for the next part of the season is to stay on that curve , to keep the development going , and for the team it 's not that much different			0
optimistic : @entity2 is in his first season as a @entity13 driver at the age of just 21 ' we need to keep developing as we have been doing because we 've done a really good job in catching up some of our rivals			2
' i know we 're not where we want to be but we have closed the gap to some really good competitors , and if we can keep that going then that would be a good plan			0
' @entity2 is mature enough to appreciate @entity3 's situation , so when it comes to personal targets there is only one worth mentioning			1
' i 'm not really planning goals for myself , ' added @entity2			2
' with where we are at the moment our goal should simply be just to win			2
' right now we 're not in a position where we can expect to be winning every race , so we need to just have the one goal , which is getting back to winning again			0
' goals like top three or top five are not relevant			0
until you win , you just have to get the most out of what you have , out of the situation			2
' @entity95 sign 16 - year - old @entity93			0
