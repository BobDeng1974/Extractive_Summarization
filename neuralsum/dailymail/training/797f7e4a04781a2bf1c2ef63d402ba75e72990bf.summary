good news : @entity2 junior @entity1 found out he was an illegal immigrant at the age of 16 , and thought getting into college would be tough			1
but when he applied to the @entity6 school , he was accepted and given a free scholarship a junior engineering student at @entity2 has written a touching essay about the moment an admissions counselor told him he could go to school for free , despite his status as an illegal immigrant			1
it was n't until high school , at the age of 16 , that @entity1 discovered he was living in the country illegally and a community college he was taking courses at called up to ask about his invalid social security number			1
' son , we overstayed our visa when you were three			0
you do n’t have a social security number , ' he recalled his mother saying , in an essay for the @entity29			0
the southern @entity31 resident and another undocumented friend named @entity33 then began their quest to find a college that would accept them , and give them the financial aid their families needed			0
while most schools will accept illegal immigrants , financial aid is trickier since , at the time , you needed a social security number in order to receive federal grants			2
@entity1 and @entity33 's only choices then were private schools , and specifically those few ' need - blind ' schools which would give them enough aid so as not to bankrupt their families			2
near the end of high school , when @entity1 was preparing to apply to schools , he took a trip to several @entity59 colleges and most of the counselors he met with encouraged him to apply			1
however , he had his sights on @entity63 and was let down when the counselor told him it would be nearly impossible to be admitted			1
the counselor told @entity1 that the only way the school admitted undocumented students was as international students			1
in order to qualify as an international student , @entity1 would be required to leave the country and then re-enter the @entity74 through an international border			1
having lived in the country illegally nearly all of his life , @entity1 certainly would have been stopped from re-entering the @entity74 , so he knew that was n't an option			1
but things started to turn up when he wandered over to a nearby @entity6 campus			0
' my dream crushed , i left the office in a daze and started walking down @entity87			0
without really planning it , i found myself in the middle of @entity2			2
' since i was there , i found the @entity92 office and walked in to tell them the truth , too			0
an officer agreed to see me			0
my meeting was brief , but it suddenly reversed all the self - doubt			0
second choice : @entity1 's dream school was @entity63 , but the school would n't accept him unless he left the country and came back as an international student			1
instead , he walked over to @entity2 's campus ( pictured ) and found he was welcome there , no matter his immigration status ' “ if you are admitted to @entity107 , ” she said , “ we will meet your full financial need without regard to your legal status			1
” @entity1 applied and a few months later received the joyous news that he had been admitted and qualified for a full - ride scholarship			1
while the university does n't require a social security number for financial aid , it does ask for some evidence of income			0
his parents had filed taxes every year , so he was able to submit that and no further questions were asked			0
' this meant i would n’t have to worry about student loans or quarterly tuition payments ; that i always had a place to stay away from home ; that i could travel every semester , on @entity2 ’s dime , back to @entity31 ; that my parents would never have to worry whether i ’d finish school			1
those are luxuries few people , documented or not , ever have , ' he wrote			0
@entity1 admits that his situation is rare in the undocumented community , that there are others just as bright as him who ca n't attend college because their parents never filled out taxes , or if they can , must hold down multiple jobs just to keep up with the payments			2
while this is the burden of undocumented children , he also identifies with his parents ' choice to break the immigration rules			0
@entity1 writes about attending a recent @entity150 where his fellow @entity152 supporters held up signs reading ' we are the 6.2 per cent ' referring to the low admission rate			2
' the opportunity to one day join the 6.2 percent ( or the 1 percent , or even just the 100 percent of legal residents who live without fear of deportation ) is worth crossing the border for			0
' @entity1 is currently studying visual and environmental studies at the @entity162 , @entity87 school			2
he also co-directed the film ' @entity164 ' about four undocumented students at @entity2 .			2

@entity1 found out he was an illegal immigrant at the age of *18*
his dream school , @entity63 , told him he was unlikely to attend since he would have to leave the country and re-enter as an international student
he applied to @entity2 instead and only had to provide tax documents to get full scholarship
