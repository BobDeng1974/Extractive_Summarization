waking up to discover your boiler is broken and you have no hot water could soon be a thing of the past			0
@entity6 has teamed up with @entity7 to test a smart boiler that can diagnose early signs of faults and breakdowns before the tank fails completely			2
this generates an alert , which prompts a call centre agent to arrange an engineer visit			2
the smart boiler uses @entity7 technology to diagnose @entity18 has a built - in wireless transmitter and a separate ‘ hub ’ which connects to the customers ’ @entity25 @entity24 boiler regularly sends data to @entity6 , in real time , which is automatically analysed and if signs of a fault are detected , an alarm is raised more than 700 homes are taking part in the trial across the @entity33 , which runs until the end of 2014			1

the benefit of the diagnostic tool is that the engineer will know what the fault is before they arrive , meaning they can take the correct part with them			0

more than 700 homes are taking part in the trial , which runs until the end of 2014 @entity93 , director of @entity94 , said : ‘ current boiler technology means many engineer visits to investigate a boiler fault result in a return visits because engineers can not carry every potential spare part with them for every visit			1
’ ‘ @entity102 which can tell us what the fault is remotely mean we can fix boilers first time , much more reliably			0
‘ it ’s never convenient when a boiler needs repairing - but this revolutionary new system will mean engineer visits are shorter			0
‘ in some cases , we ’ll be able to contact the customer and arrange to fix the boiler before our customer even notices a problem			0

the smart boiler uses @entity7 technology to diagnose faults
it has a wireless transmitter and a ‘ hub ’ that connects to a @entity25 *network*
more than 700 homes are taking part in the trial that runs to the end of 2014
boiler sends data to @entity6 in real time , and is automatically analysed
if the first signs of faults and breakdowns are detected , an alert is raised
an agent then calls the customer and arranges an engineer visit
