the smell of books that lingers in second - hand book stores is distinctive , but it is hard to know exactly what creates the nostalgic aroma			1
now one @entity7 chemistry teacher has created an infographic to explain how and why the scent of antique and new books differ			1
old books have a sweet smell with notes of vanilla flowers and almonds , caused by the breakdown of chemical compounds in the paper , while new books smell like they do because of chemicals used in their manufacture			1
one @entity7 chemistry teacher has created an infographic to explain the scent of antique and new books			1
the anonymous blogger started publishing his infographics six months ago after creating some posters to brighten up his classroom and hopes to explain the chemistry of everyday substances			0
' @entity29 ' is generated by the breakdown of cellulose and lignin in paper , which produces organic compounds			1
@entity38 adds an almond - like scent , vanillin smells of vanilla and ethyl hexanol has a ‘ slightly floral ’ scent			2
@entity42 benzene and toluene , which are also produced give off impart odours			0
these volatile organic compounds are created by reactions known as ‘ acid hydrolysis ’ and together make up the smell of old books along with other alcohols produced by the reactions			1
no - one is sure of exactly which chemical compounds contribute to ' new book smell '			1
the scent differs from book to book as different chemicals are used in the making of different volumes			0
it is thought the smell derives from three main sources : the paper , inks used to print the book and the adhesives used in book binding			2
the anonymous blogger said the chemical breakdown of compounds within paper leads to the production of ‘ old book smell ’			1
paper contains cellulose and small amounts of lignin - a complex polymer of aromatic alcohols – and finer papers contain less lignin than cheaper material like newsprint			0
lignin is what makes paper yellow with age because oxidation reactions cause it to break down into acids , which then help break down cellulose , he explained in the @entity92 blog			0
the smell of old books comes from chemical degradation and a number of compounds have been pinpointed			1

some compounds such as furfural are useful to determine the damage to antique volumes			0
it can be used to date tomes as well as to determine their composition			0
books published after the mid- 1800s emit more furfal than older volumes which are composed of cotton or linen paper			2
the anonymous blogger said that it is difficult to pinpoint specific compounds found in new books , mainly because the chemicals used to manufacture books vary , meaning the smell differs between literary works			1
‘ add to this the fact that there are literally hundreds of compounds involved and it becomes clearer why it evades attribution to a small selection of chemicals , ’ he wrote			2

lots of chemicals are used to make paper , which is largely manufactured from wood pulp			0
chemicals such as sodium hydroxide – which is often known as caustic soda – can be added to decrease the acidity and cause fibres in the pulp to swell			0
the fibres are bleached with a mixture of other chemicals including hydrogen peroxide and are mixed with water , which itself contains additives			0
some of these chemicals react and release volatile organic compounds into the air , which create the distinctive smell that varies from book to book depending on the adhesives , ink and paper used .			1

the smell of new books depends on chemicals used in their manufacture and this can vary from volume to volume
