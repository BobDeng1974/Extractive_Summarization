@entity0 has insisted he was right to let hundreds of thousands of @entity2 migrants move to @entity3			1
the former prime minister said it was not a ' mistake ' to open @entity3 's borders to eight former @entity9 countries in 2004 , despite the decision being criticised by the @entity12 leader @entity11			1
mr @entity11 said the @entity13 had ' got it wrong ' when he allowed people from @entity16 , @entity17 and the @entity18 to work in @entity3 without restrictions			1
@entity0 has insisted he was right to let hundreds of thousands of @entity2 migrants move to @entity3 @entity3 was almost alone in the @entity20 in not imposing transitional controls to slow the rate of migration			1
the decision to allow freedom of movement into @entity3 sparked a mass wage of migration - with around 170,000 eastern @entity2 migrants moving to the @entity3 every year			1
mr @entity11 said the party under mr @entity0 ' became too disconnected from the concerns of working people '			1
the @entity12 leader has pledged to ban immigrants from claiming benefits for two years and to tackle rogue employers exploiting migrant labour			2
but mr @entity0 said political leaders needed to stand up and defend freedom of movement in @entity2			2
he said the only way to defeat @entity41 and other anti-immigration parties was to expose their ' ridiculous ' plans			0
labour leader @entity11 said mr @entity0 had ' got it wrong ' when he allowed people from @entity16 , @entity17 and the @entity18 to work in @entity3 without restrictions			1
mr @entity0 said migrants would have come sooner or later even if transitional controls had been imposed			1
he said : ' i do n't agree it was a mistake			2
all we did was bring forward what would have happened anyway			0
in 2004 the economy was booming and we had a requirement for skilled workers from abroad			0
' supposing you put all those people from @entity2 back out of @entity3 again would we be a stronger better country ? the answer is no. ' @entity0 said political leaders should attack @entity61 instead of pandering to his party 's views mr @entity0 made the remarks in an interview with @entity66 , the former head of the @entity67 , for a @entity69 documentary to be broadcast on thursday			1
he said @entity70 should argue back against people like @entity73 voter @entity72 â€“ the infamous @entity12 - supporting pensioner dismissed as a ' bigot ' by @entity75 in the run up to the 2010 election for complaining about the levels of immigration			2
mr @entity0 said : ' i would have said to her , i understand why you feel as you feel and why it 's difficult			1
' but here 's the other side of the picture			0
so if we want to keep all those people out of the country let 's look at what their impact has actually been on our country and let 's look at why the idea in the @entity20 that people are able to move freely across frontiers is a good idea			0
' i mean , you have just got to put the argument			0
she probably would n't agree and she might vote for someone else as a result			0
' political leaders have a ' duty ' to say that @entity41 's proposals to end free movement are ' ridiculous ' , he said			0
he said : ' if @entity3 wrenched itself out of the @entity20 , this idea that @entity61 would go off - can you imagine anything more ridiculous than the idea that he would negotiate a bespoke agreement between @entity3 and the @entity20 ? ' i mean that would be an interesting negotiation to be a fly on the wall on			2
' ' i 'm not saying you do n't have to deal with it with a real understanding of the anxieties that people have but your job as the leader is to say ' well , look , this is where i think we should go			0
' ' if you believe in the @entity41 thing then say it , but do n't indulge their rhetoric , their sentiment around the issue , because what you do then is you effectively you give them a greater credibility			0
