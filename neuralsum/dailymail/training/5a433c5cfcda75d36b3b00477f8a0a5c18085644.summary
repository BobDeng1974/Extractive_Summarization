@entity1 's urgent quest to appoint a new national coach ahead of their @entity4 tour took a major step forward today , as @entity7 confirmed that he has been offered the job			1
the @entity10 coach – who was previously in charge at @entity12 and @entity13 – guided his side to the @entity16 title this year and he was linked to the @entity1 role even before @entity19 ’s abrupt resignation on saturday			1
now , rumours that @entity7 had already been approached have been reinforced by the news that he is on the verge of being appointed			2
on sunday , @entity22 , the embattled chief executive of the @entity23 , claimed that he faced a race to find a coach to front the five - match tour which begins against the @entity27 at @entity28 on november 1			2
however , it appears that he had in fact made his move during the final stages of @entity34 ’s turbulent regime			0
@entity1 's late defeat to @entity36 forced coach @entity19 to resign before @entity37 @entity34 ( above ) announced his departure at a press conference immediately after the defeat @entity7 ( above ) is set to take over from @entity34 , and lead @entity1 for their @entity42 tour of @entity4 @entity7 suggested that he is keen to accept the job , but there are still issues to resolve if he is to be in position by the time the @entity1 fly north on friday			1
‘ it ’s a pretty humbling experience to be asked to be involved in something like that , but we ’ll see what happens , ’ he told the @entity47			1
‘ there are a few things to be ironed out , obviously the logistics etc ... everything is so close			0
so we will see how it goes and work it out from there			0
’ asked if he was excited about the opportunity , he added : ‘ who would n't be excited			0
’ and despite having a year left on his contract with the @entity10 , it seems that the @entity65 - based franchise are ready to release him in the national interest			0
@entity34 resigned shortly after @entity1 succumbed to an agonising 29 - 28 defeat against @entity36 in @entity68 – against a backdrop of controversy			1
@entity71 celebrates as his late try hands @entity36 a 29 - 28 victory over @entity1 the @entity36 side perform the @entity75 before the start of the game against @entity1 his position had appeared untenable as the @entity23 were thought to have begun discreetly sounding out potential replacements for the former @entity81 coach , who only took over last summer			1
he had been under siege after suspending maverick back @entity84 for sending offensive text messages about a female member of the @entity1 ’ staff , team business manager @entity87 – who promptly resigned			1
@entity34 was then forced to deny having a personal relationship with @entity87			0
@entity22 , chief executive of the @entity23 , hastily blamed @entity34 ’s departure on a media campaign against him , leading to questions about his own position			0
‘ @entity19 said he was going to struggle to retain the level of support he needs from the playing group , in my view , because of the character assassination he ’s suffered in the last two weeks			2
’ the @entity1 are in turmoil , just weeks before matches against the @entity27 , @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104 – and 11 months before a @entity105 where they find themselves in a pool of death alongside @entity104 and @entity101 .			0
