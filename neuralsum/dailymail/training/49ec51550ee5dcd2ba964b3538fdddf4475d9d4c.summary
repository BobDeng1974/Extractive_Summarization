@entity1 manager @entity0 has every intention of adding to under - fire @entity5 boss @entity4 ' misery			1
a run of four straight defeats this month - including three in the @entity6 - was finally ended with wednesday 's 2 - 2 draw in the @entity10 at @entity12 side @entity11			1
next up for @entity4 and the @entity13 on saturday is what appears to be a tough @entity16 clash with a @entity1 side that has already won away at @entity18 and @entity19 this season			1
@entity5 boss @entity4 is enduring a tough spell as his side continue a poor run of results @entity5 's fixtures in the next three weeks : @entity1 ( h ) sat 29 nov ( @entity6 ) @entity27 ( a ) tue 2 dec ( @entity6 ) @entity28 ( h ) sat 6 dec ( @entity6 ) @entity30 ( h ) tue 9 dec ( @entity10 ) @entity31 ( a ) @entity32 14 dec ( l ) @entity33 ( a ) wed 17 dec ( @entity34 ) @entity35 ( h ) @entity32 21 dec ( @entity6 ) @entity0 feels some of the criticism heaped on @entity4 has been unfair given he has been without two players this season who scored 55 goals between them for @entity5 last term			1
with @entity44 sold to @entity45 and @entity46 out for the last three months and not expected to return until the new year due to a thigh injury , it is no wonder @entity4 is feeling the heat			1
' when people sense there is a little bit of pressure building then everybody jumps on the bandwagon and tries to add to it , which is unfair , ' @entity0 said			2
@entity1 manager @entity0 hopes to add to @entity5 's miserable run at @entity16 on saturday @entity59 , @entity60 and other @entity5 players look dejected after conceding late at @entity11 ' but that happens to all of us			1
it 's not something @entity66 is unaware of			2
he understands how it works			2
' but when you lose the services of two strikers such as @entity44 and @entity46 , then it 's going to impact on you			0
' there were only three players in the @entity6 last season who scored more than 20 goals , and @entity5 had two of them			2
@entity4 cut a frustrated figure on the touchline against @entity11 on wednesday evening ' so that shows where their season was built - on the back of two outstanding strikers			1
' they have n't had their services this year so it 's going to take a big part of their game away from them			0
' naturally , for @entity0 it is something to exploit , even if it means piling the pressure on @entity4			2
' they 've a big squad that can manage any number of games they have ahead of them , ' the @entity94 added			0
@entity101 , who joined in the summer , scored only his second @entity5 goal against @entity11 ' i saw a picture in the paper the other day that showed the strength of their bench , worth something like Â£ 100million , so they do have resources they can use			1
' the focus that seems to be on them at the moment is maybe something they need to deal with , and if we can add to that , then we will try to do that			0
' but they 're an outstanding team , with great players , and although it 's a tough test for us we 've proven this year we can go anywhere and get positive results , so that 's our intention again			0
' injured striker @entity127 is yet to score a @entity6 goal for @entity5 since returning to @entity129 the trip to @entity5 sparks a tough stretch of fixtures for @entity1 as they also face @entity35 , @entity31 and @entity133 in the run - up to @entity135			1
despite that , @entity0 said : ' we 're looking forward to them			0
' the big teams are always the test , but we 're playing well , despite last week 's defeat to @entity141 when we did n't play poorly , we just made mistakes , which can happen			0
' but confidence-wise we 're in very good shape , and that 's off the back of a very good performance against @entity19 the week before where we won comfortably in my view			0
@entity1 are without on - loan midfielder @entity150 , who is sidelined for up to eight weeks with a thigh injury ' so we can go to the bigger teams , the teams with more resources and in terms of playing staff , and give a good account of ourselves , as we 've already proven this season			1
' a virus that had swept through the training ground this week appears to have eased as three players off sick on thursday all reported in for training on friday , with no new casualties			0
goalkeeper @entity164 and defenders @entity165 and @entity167 are back in contention			0
two other defenders in @entity170 and @entity171 are also available after missing the loss to @entity141 with calf and hamstring injuries respectively			0
@entity0 , though , is without on - loan midfielder @entity150 who is sidelined for six to eight weeks with a thigh injury .			2
