@entity0 published : 17:03 est , 4 august 2013 updated : 17:04 est , 4 august 2013 in safe hands : @entity2 , from @entity3 , @entity4 , being held by his three - year - old sister @entity5 he had only a 50 - 50 chance of surviving birth but now little @entity2 is being kept alive by a very special drug – @entity9			1
the five - month - old was born with his stomach , intestines and part of his liver inside his chest , leaving no room for his tiny lungs to develop			1
his heart , which has a hole in it , was also pushed to the wrong side and he has problems with the flow of blood to his lungs			2
@entity2 underwent a life - saving seven - hour operation to correct the position of his organs when he was only four days old			1
he then spent three months in hospital , clinging to life			2
now he is back home with his parents and is winning his battle for survival thanks to sildenafil , better known as the impotence drug @entity9			0
his mother , @entity36 , 33 , from @entity3 , @entity4 , said : ‘ @entity2 has pulmonary hypertension and the drug helps to widen the [ blood ] vessels going into the lungs so the blood can flow better			1
‘ he gets it four times a day			1
if he did n’t take it , his lungs would be compromised and would n’t function as well and he would n’t get enough oxygen going around his body			2
’ mrs @entity48 was given the devastating news that her son had a congenital diaphragmatic hernia – a hole in the abdominal wall – when she was only 20 weeks pregnant , the same time she lost a baby only a year earlier			1
for the rest of her pregnancy , she and husband , @entity55 , 34 , undertook round trips of almost 200 miles to hospital in @entity60 every four weeks to monitor their unborn child			0
half of all babies with the condition die before they are born			0
the couple were warned that even if the child survived birth , there was a risk he might not live more than a couple of hours			0
mrs @entity48 said : ‘ we were told that if he survived the first 24 hours , the outcome would look better , but in particular they said the first two hours were critical			1
’ to add to the complications , the umbilical cord became wrapped around @entity2 ’s neck			1
pulling together : @entity2 , who was born with his stomach in his chest , with his mother @entity36 , father @entity55 and sister @entity5 despite this and the fact his lungs were not fully developed , the 6lb 8oz newborn was breathing well enough for doctors to let his parents see him before he was whisked away and placed on a ventilator			1
mrs @entity48 , who is also mother to @entity5 , three , said : ‘ he ’s a tough little cookie			1
all the way through the pregnancy we were told there were no guarantees that he would survive past birth			0
‘ but he breathed a little bit on his own before they put him on the ventilator , so that was a bit of a relief			0
‘ i got to see him for a few seconds			0
we were still very worried at that point but i noticed he had the longest , curliest eyelashes			0
’ @entity2 was born at the @entity104 in @entity60 on march 1 , a week before his due date			1
his life - threatening condition affects only 2,500 babies			1
a hole in @entity2 ’s abdomen wall allowed his stomach , bowel and part of his liver to form inside his chest			1
this pushed his heart out of position and left no room for his lungs to grow , resulting in one being only a quarter of the size it should be			2
the five - month - old , who spent three weeks on a ventilator , a further five weeks on other breathing aids and battled repeated infections , was finally allowed home after 12 weeks			2
it was a day his father feared he would never see			0
but mrs @entity48 did not have any similar doubts			1
she said : ‘ i never for one moment thought we ’d never get him home			0
’ initially when he came home , @entity2 was on eight different drugs			2
but now he only receives @entity9 pills four times a day , two anti-reflux tablets and an iron supplement to help transport oxygen around his body			2
he is still tube fed when he sleeps at night to ensure that he continues to put on weight			0
and he receives regular check - ups at the hospital to monitor his progress and the hole in his heart			0
mrs @entity48 said : ‘ it is amazing to be the four of us as a family			1
it was really hard being away from my daughter			0
‘ he ’s certainly put us through it , but it ’s been worth it			0
‘ i would n’t change him for the world and his big sister loves him to pieces			0
‘ now it ’s like he ’s always been here			0

@entity2 takes viagra four times a day to keep his lungs working
he had to undergo a life - saving seven - hour operation to move his organs
