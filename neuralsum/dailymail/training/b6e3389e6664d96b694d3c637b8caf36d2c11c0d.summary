onlookers were stunned when the students effortlessly ran through a list of about 20 additional words bee officials picked out of their @entity50 's 11th edition during the lunch break , the @entity44 reported			1
but bee officials decided not to pull more words from the dictionary because they worried one speller might get a tough word and the other a relatively easy one , which would n't be fair			2

it was stopped after round 66 and will resume on march 8 because officials want to *ensure* new list of words is fair
