by @entity0 published : 04:47 est , 20 june 2012 updated : 06:52 est , 21 june 2012 agony : @entity2 struggled to walk on his broken right knee after doctors misdiagnosed his injury last month a two - year - old boy who broke his knee in an agonising gymnastics accident was forced to walk on the untreated injury for two weeks because doctors dismissed it as ' psychological '			1
@entity2 took a tumble on may 21 and was initially told he had suffered a ' suspected hairline fracture below the right knee '			1
but after being given a temporary cast and booked into a fracture clinic appointment 10 days later , doctors looked at his original x-rays and decided to remove the cast			1
to the amazement of his mother @entity22 , the youngster could still not put any weight on his right leg at the follow - up appointment , but was told this was a ' psychological issue ' and that he would be walking within a few days			1
mrs @entity27 , 33 , said : ' the doctor informed us there was no fracture to his leg and asked @entity2 to walk , but he struggled to put any weight on his right leg			1
' the doctor said this was psychological and he would be walking within the next few days			0
' @entity2 was then discharged without a plaster cast and no further appointments were arranged			2
but as time passed , it became evident @entity2 ’s leg was not improving and his mum decided to take him to the @entity43 department at @entity44 in @entity45 , for a second opinion			2
she explained : ' we were extremely unhappy with how @entity2 was walking			2
' his right foot was turning out and he had been limping from the point he first put the foot on the floor , which was two days after being discharged from @entity52			0
' @entity53 ’s referred him to his gp at @entity55 who was equally concerned at the way the two - year - old was walking and immediately arranged a further appointment at the fracture clinic			1
on june 14 , mrs @entity27 took her son back to @entity52 , two weeks after he had been discharged			0
mrs @entity27 , of @entity62 , @entity63 , said : ' we were sent for more x-rays of @entity2 ’s hips and right leg			2
probe : bosses at @entity69 in @entity70 are investigating how the youngster 's broken knee was missed by medics ' on returning to the consultant we were told he had a definite break just below the right knee			0
' we were told @entity2 was very lucky there was no long - term damage yet			0
' he admitted the initial fracture diagnosis was a mistake and we had every right to be angry but we should concentrate on getting @entity2 back to full health			1
' despite having further appointments at @entity52 ’s fracture clinic , mrs @entity27 says she ' does not trust the hospital '			1
she added : ' i ’ve got no confidence in them but have to go back because @entity2 started his treatment there			0
' a @entity69 spokesman said : ' we take complaints very seriously and we will be investigating			0
' once we have concluded our investigations , we will be writing to @entity96 and mrs @entity27 with the results of our findings			0

*experts* diagnosed @entity2 , 2 , with hairline fracture , only for fracture clinic to remove case and say injury was ' psychological '
youngster walked for two weeks on knee injury before it was finally *spotted*
