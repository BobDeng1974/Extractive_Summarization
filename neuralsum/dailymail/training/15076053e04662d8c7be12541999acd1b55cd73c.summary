by @entity0 @entity1 : 08:07 est , 18 december 2013 @entity2 : 10:20 est , 18 december 2013 fires at an historic city centre pub will have to be put out after a landlord was told it was causing pollution following a passer - by 's complaint about smoke in the street			1
@entity11 , 60 , has traditionally lit three fires for customers at his real ale bar so they can keep warm over the @entity16 period			1
but officials at @entity18 have now said his 115 - year - old @entity20 pub is pumping out fumes - putting it in breach of smokeless zone rules			1
@entity24 has been told he has to put out the fires in his pub following a complaint about smoke by a passer - by mr @entity11 said an inspector turned up at the pub to say a ' passer - by ' had seen smoke coming from the chimney 24 hours earlier and put in a complaint			1
mr @entity11 has now been ordered to stop burning wood in the @entity36 fireplaces and could face a fine of up to £ 1,000 , under the @entity38 1993 , if he refuses			1
mr @entity11 , who runs the pub with wife @entity40 , said : ' the fireplaces are part of the history of the building and what makes the pub so popular			1
' we ’ve actually been named @entity18 ’s city pub of the year by the same council that is now trying to stop what we ’re doing			1
' all of our regulars are up in arms			0
last night we had a party and four councillors , two police officers and two firemen signed our petition to keep the fires			2
we ’ve already got 500 names on the petition and we ’re thinking about talking it to court			0
' there is no alternative to the log fire			0
a log burner would produce the same amount of smoke , and i maintain that our fires do not create any smoke anyway			1
officials at @entity18 have said mr @entity11 's 115 - year - old @entity20 pub is pumping out fumes - putting it in breach of smokeless zone rules ' i can not understand the humbug attitudes of some people in authority			1
they ’ll probably ban carol singers next for polluting the atmosphere if they ca n’t sing			0
' the @entity20 is a @entity85 - listed building , highly commended by @entity86 , and is on the @entity87			2
it was voted @entity88 by the @entity90 team just seven weeks ago			0
' i can not understand the humbug attitudes of some people in authority			0
they ’ll probably ban carol singers next for polluting the atmosphere if they ca n’t sing ' - @entity24 it has also featured on a television series and attracts visitors from far afield because of its little - altered interior with wooden panelling , tiled bar and mosaic floor			2
the fireplaces and the interior in general led to the pub being awarded a @entity108 blue plaque			0
but an inspector this week visited the pub to speak to mr @entity11 following a complaint			1
the landlord said : ' there was a complaint made on monday and then straight away a council officer arrived at the pub to tell us to stop burning logs in the fire because we were in a smokeless zone			1
' he said someone had complained about smoke outside in the street but that ’s nonsense because i ’ve stood outside and there is n’t any wafting about			2
' i explained that all fires will make smoke when they start and that my fires do not make a lot of smoke			2
' i ended up throwing him out of the pub because i could n’t believe what he was saying			0
' you ca n’t order an historic pub like ours to just stop burning wood in the fireplaces			0
what do the council want us to do ? get rid of the fireplaces and replace them with radiators ? ' on the one hand we have all of the regulations that say that we must retain the character of the @entity85 listed building and then you have the council jobsworths talking about health and safety			0
' @entity156 , the regional director of @entity108 , said : ' i have never heard of anything like it			0
' @entity160 is a cracking pub and it has been refurbished very tastefully by @entity11 since he went in there			1
it is part of the character of the building and it would be dreadful if they stopped them having a fire in there			0
' a @entity170 spokesman said : ' burning logs creates pollution through smoke and soot and we have had complaints about the smoke at the @entity20 pub. ' like most towns and cities , @entity180 city centre is covered by a smoke control order that means only smokeless fuels can be burned on an open fire			2
' logs can be burned , but only in special wood - burning appliances that take out the soot and smoke			2
the rules are for the benefit of everyone and we are happy to work with the business owner to help them comply			0
