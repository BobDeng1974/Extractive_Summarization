by @entity0 @entity2 parents have admitted to putting their son in chains and refusing to let him go as a punishment for constant stealing			2
father @entity7 , 47 , chained up his son , @entity8 , 24 , because he believed his thieving habits had brought shame on the family			1
as a result he tied his son to his bedroom in their house in @entity18 village in south @entity2 's @entity20 province , for fear that if he did n't stop his son from stealing , he would soon end up in jail			2
@entity24 ( pictured ) with his neck in chains in an attempt by his parents to get him to stop stealing @entity8 was chained by the neck to a heavy concrete block , which he placed in the boy 's bedroom so that he could n't do anything but move around the room and sit in his bed			1
@entity7 said : ' it is n't exactly a large community here , when something is stolen everybody knows who 's to blame			0
' i always had to compensate my neighbours and apologise for what he had stolen if i could n't return it and i just got fed up with it			0
' i ca n't keep paying compensation all the time because i just ca n't afford it and eventually someone was can call the police and he would have been locked up			0
@entity24 had been stealing things around the neighbourhood to the point that his parents could no longer keep bailing him out @entity8 's parents tied him by the neck to a concrete block that his father found , so that he could not leave his room ' i do n't think once you been jailed would be any chance of correcting him and so we have kept him at home and chained him up to remind him exactly what a wonderful thing is to have freedom			1
' he said that every time the youngster had stolen something he had given him repeating warnings			0
but he explained that nothing had helped over the years			0
his parents claim the did not have the money to keep bailing their son out of his scrapes , it appeared that there would be no end to the thievery , so they turned to a unique brand of parenting his parents intend to keep him chained up until they are convinced he has ' learned his lesson ' so @entity8 's parents felt they only had one option : a prolonged stay in chains			1
@entity7 added : ' i do n't know how long they will people like that , we need to be convinced he 's learned his lesson and is prepared to become a proper part of the community			2

@entity7 , 47 , chained up his son @entity8 , 24 , for constantly stealing

@entity97 **decided** they could no longer afford to keep paying them
they **decided** to chain him to a concrete block in his bedroom
@entity8 's father said it was the only way he would learn his lesson
