by @entity0 it may be hard to believe , but the quality of air over major @entity6 cities has improved over the past decade , new satellite images show			1
data collected by probes orbiting the earth for almost a decade has shown that the concentration of a damaging pollutant above cities including @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 has dropped by as much as 42 per cent			1
information from the @entity18 ( @entity18 ) shows that , between 2005 and 2011 , there is significantly less nitrogen dioxide in the atmosphere			1
changes : as shown above , @entity24 data indicates that levels of pollutant nitrogen dioxide have dropped significantly across the @entity6 between 2005 and 2011 nitrogen dioxide is a yellow - brown gas produced by burning petrol , and is regulated by the @entity6 government			1
it has been linked to a host of respiratory problems , and can make those who breathe it in more vulnerable to diseases like flu			2
the levels above major cities have fallen , despite both the human population and number of cars on the roads steadily increasing			2
according to scientists , the welcome change comes because of better technology , economic changes and tougher state regulation			1
windy city : @entity15 , pictured above , has experienced the most significant change , with 43 per cent less of the pollutant between the more red picture , in 2005 , and the less red one from 2011			2
pull the slider to see the difference @entity56 : @entity57 , pictured above , saw a 26 per cent decrease from the redder image in 2005 to the bluer one in 2011			0
pull the slider to see the difference information shown in the images , which colour areas of high - quality air in blue and low - quality air in red , indicates that some cities have had their share of nitrogen dioxide drop by more than 40 per cent			1
@entity15 has 43 per cent less of the pollutant in their air than in 2005 , @entity16 40 per cent less and @entity74 , @entity75 , experience a 42 per cent drop			0
@entity14 's figure decreased by 32 per cent , @entity57 's by 26 and @entity77 , @entity78 , had a 24 per cent drop			1
the measurements were taken in the summer months and averaged out over several years			0
however , the @entity6 @entity82 says the levels of pollution are still too high			1
according to its estimates 142million people , almost half the @entity6 population , live in areas with unhealthy air			0
nobody walks : @entity16 had its pollution fall by 2005 between the redder image in 2005 and the bluer one in 2011			0
pull the slider to see the difference big apple : @entity14 's pollution figure fell 32 per cent between 2005 ( redder image ) and 2011 ( bluer image )			0
pull the slider to see the difference @entity103 , a @entity24 atmospheric scientists based in @entity105 , @entity106 , said : ' while our air quality has certainly improved over the last few decades , there is still work to do – ozone and particulate matter are still problems			0
' @entity24 says the new information will supplement existing data , which is usually taken from the ground rather than space			0
' you ca n't control what you do n't measure , ' said @entity119 of the @entity120 , @entity121 , and member of the @entity123 – created in 2011 by the @entity124 to serve the needs of @entity6 air quality management through the use of @entity129 satellite data , suborbital , and models			2
' @entity124 measurements of air quality have value to the people with the authority to control emissions and develop policy			0

data collected from probes orbiting earth shows fall in nitrogen dioxide
@entity6 cities such as @entity14 and @entity57 had levels fall by around 40 *%*
experts say the change is *due* to better technology and state regulation
nitrogen dioxide controlled pollutant which is linked to breathing problems
