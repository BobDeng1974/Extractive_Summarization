caught out : @entity0 with @entity1 this year the three girlfriends of a cheating supermarket worker decided to humiliate him in public after realising he had slept with all of them within 24 hours			1
@entity1 , @entity7 and a third girl , who does not wish to be named , confronted @entity0 , 20 , when they discovered he had been triple - timing them for months			1
the @entity10 reported earlier this week how they ambushed him at @entity11 , shouting ‘ cheat ’ and ‘ liar ’ , when he returned from a holiday in @entity14			1
but miss @entity1 , 17 , a student from @entity15 , @entity16 , yesterday revealed how the trio hatched the plan after realising the extent of his deceit			1
she told @entity21 : ‘ we are pretty sure that he slept with us all in one day , which is disgusting			2
i spoke to @entity7 and the other girl and we realised that @entity0 had had sex with me one morning , then with @entity7 that afternoon , then the other one at her house the day after			1
’ ‘ i do n’t know why we did it			2
he was boring , and we all agreed he was n’t great in bed			2
’ mr @entity0 , from @entity30 , was rumbled when a-level pupil @entity31 , who was at his house the night before he went on holiday , picked up his phone and saw a message from a girl saying ‘ i will meet you later ’			1
it made her suspicious because , she said , he had asked her to go home early that night because he had to finish his packing			1
‘ we arranged to meet in a pub , and it turned out that she , like me , had had her suspicions			0
i ’d been seeing him since march and she had been seeing him since january			0
’ they then met the other girl after contacting her on @entity54			1
‘ it turned out that she thought she was @entity0 ’s girlfriend , too			2
we could n’t believe it , ’ miss @entity1 said			0
@entity1 , 17 , @entity7 , 19 , and the third girl , 20 , ( @entity59 ) all had relationships with him mr @entity0 , pictured with @entity1 earlier this year , juggled excuses and pet names to avoid being rumbled miss @entity63 , 19 , a bar supervisor from @entity65 , said : ‘ when i met him in april @entity0 seemed so perfect , he really did			1
‘ but when we all looked back , we could see how he ’d done it			0
when he left my house he ’d never let me walk him down to his car , saying he wanted to listen to his music on his headphones			0
he ’d meet another girl at the end of my road			0
’ but their moment of revenge was sweet			0
miss @entity1 said : ‘ he came round the corner and just froze			0
he did n’t know what to say			0
’ as the girls chanted ‘ @entity83 ’ , and asked him to explain himself , mr @entity0 fled with his grandmother , who he had persuaded to collect him			1
miss @entity63 said : ‘ @entity0 carried on walking past us because he had no other way of getting out			2
‘ we looked at each other and thought , ‘ ‘ what ? ” so we followed him saying , “ do you not have anything to say for yourself ? ” ‘ he could n’t believe it , and did n’t know what to say			0
’ however , the story does have a happy ending			0
the three women are now friends			0
mr @entity0 , who has not replied to @entity21 's attempts to contact him , is no longer seeing any of the girls and , despite initial attempts to win them back , has not been in touch .			1

@entity0 , 20 , from @entity30 , was seeing three girlfriends at once
all three girls , from @entity16 , made contact over @entity47 and @entity54
they met and discovered they *'d* all been to bed with him in a 24 - hour period
disgusted , they decided to confront him at @entity11 when he got home
mr @entity0 saw all three of them waiting for him when he came out of *customs*
he fled with his grandmother as his girlfriends demanded an explanation
girls say they were *n't* the only ones the @entity125 worker charmed into bed
