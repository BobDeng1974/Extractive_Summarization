it is a landscape of jagged peaks and deep lakes that have never been directly seen with human eyes			2
and now it seems the ghostly @entity5 , that are buried beneath two and a half miles ( 4km ) of ice in @entity8 , are even stranger than scientists could have imagined			1
an international team of scientists has found that despite being 500 million years old - 200 million years older than the @entity12 - they show almost no signs of weathering			1
the haunting images of the @entity15 obtained by scientists have earned them the nickname the @entity19			0
the clusters of vertical lines in this image show water filled valleys instead , the peaks , which rise 8,850ft ( 2,700 metres ) above sea level yet do not break out beyond the surface of the ice , have been preserved by the frozen sheet that lies on top of them			1
stranger still , the scientists have found evidence that melt water from the bottom of the enormous ice sheet may actually be flowing up the mountains			1
snow falling on the surface of the ice sheet causes the temperature close to peaks of the @entity41 to fall in a process called divergent cooling			1
at the same time , heat radiating from the bedrock beneath the ice causes melt water to form rivers and lakes in the deep valley between the mountains			0
however , with the huge pressure of the ice on top of them , the water is pushed in the same direction as the ice is flowing , causing water to flow up valleys against gravity			1
as this uphill flow meets the colder temperatures from above towards the top of the peaks , it refreezes , protecting the ridge line from erosion			2
this effectively cryogenically freezes the mountains in time , making them appear much younger than they are			0
forming around 550 million years ago when two continental plates collided , they should appear far more eroded than they are			2
professor @entity74 , a geophysicist at @entity76 's @entity75 and lead author of the study , said that in places water is flowing uphill for thousands of metres			1
he said : ' along the southern and northern margins of the @entity41 , the ice surface and bed slopes oppose each other , and water is driven up steep slopes toward thinner ice			0
' these elevation gains are commonly thousands of meters and make these pathways striking examples of glacially driven uphill water flow			2
' the research team used data gathered from two twin - engine aircraft equipped with ice penetrating radar , gravity metres and magnetometers to build up a picture of the mountain range			1
first discovered in 1958 , it took more than 50 years before scientists were able to see what the mountains looked like beneath the ice			0
the fuzzy grey images they obtained of the towering crags helped to earn the @entity110 mountains the nickname of the ghost mountains			0
the landscape that emerged was one of saw toothed ridges and towering crags that are more typically associated with younger mountain ranges like the @entity12 and the @entity118			2
the scientists estimate that without the weight of the ice sheet pushing down on them , the mountains would rebound to tower more than 10,800ft ( 3,300 metres )			1
in a paper in the journal @entity126 , they describe how they also discovered a network of lakes and rivers in the valleys that cut through the @entity41			0
although meltwater usually speeds up erosion of mountains by glaciers , it seems that in the @entity41 the water refreezes on the ridgelines to protect them researchers used ice penetrating radar and other sensors onboard aircraft that they flew above ice to build up the first picture of the rugged landscape of the @entity110 mountains below			1
from above the ice is flat the high pressure from the ice above pushes meltwater in the valleys below the ice uphill in the same direction as the overlying ice is flowing , creating a frozen barrier around the ridgeline that protects against erosoin using an underwater robot , polar scientists have been able to to build up a detailed three dimensional picture of the ice that builds up over the sea each winter			1
the depth of ice around @entity8 is notoriously difficult to measure due to the thick blanket of snow that covers it			0
but now high - resolution mapping of the sea ice using an autonomous underwater vehicle known as @entity171 has shown that it is up to 56 feet thick in some places			0
it was typically thought that the ice was only a few metres thick in most areas			0
in some places , the weight of the ice sheet forces water to flow against the pull of gravity			1
this uphill flow refreezes when it meets colder temperatures coming from the ice above			0
professor @entity74 said : ' the ice sheet acts like an anti-aging cream			2
' it triggers a series of thermodynamic processes that have almost perfectly preserved the @entity41 since ice began spreading across the continent			0
' dr @entity195 , head of airborne geophysics at the @entity197 and a co-author on the paper , added that this process is thought to have been occurring for around 34 million years since glaciers began forming on @entity8			1
he said : ' how mountain ranges form and are preserved in the middle of old continents for millions of years are fundamental questions in @entity206			0
' our new research has important additional ramifications for our understanding of long - term climate and ice sheet change			2
' this study shows that interplays between topography , water , ice sheets and tectonics must be considered in order to understand the preservation of mountain ranges such as the @entity41			0
' if these mountains in interior @entity8 had been more significantly eroded , then the ice sheet itself may have had a different history			1
' first discovered in 1958 , it took more than 50 years before scientists could see what the mountains looked like beneath the ice			0
the mountains ( marked ) are two and a half miles ( 4km ) under the east of the continent the researchers have been able to build up the first picture of what lies beneath the ice of @entity8 the lost boys never aged while they were in @entity239 in @entity241 's book @entity242 , and it seems that the @entity245 mountains beneath the antarctic ice are also protected from the ravages of time			2

images from ice penetrating radar and other sensors reveal @entity8 's @entity254 as a landscape of razor sharp ridges and peaks
pressure from ice sheet above forces water uphill for thousands of metres
peaks tower more than *8,800ft* above sea level but are totally buried by ice
@entity5 are around 200 million years older than the @entity12
yet scientists found little sign of erosion as water flowing uphill refreezes and creates a protective barrier around the peaks to preserve them
