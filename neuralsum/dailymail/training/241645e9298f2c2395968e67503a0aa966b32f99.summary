many drivers , tired of long journeys and tedious traffic jams , are looking forward to when self - driving cars will be an affordable option			1
and while @entity6 and car makers are working on the next generation of vehicles , a $ 10,000 ( £ 5,900 ) gadget could beat the big firms to controlling your car remotely , as soon as next year			1
the @entity13 claims to be the world ’s first ‘ highway autopilot ’ and can take control of car on a motorway , keeping it safely in lane and a suitable distance from the car in front			1
easy driver : the @entity13 ( pictured ) claims to be the world 's first ' highway autopilot ' and can take control of car on a motorway , keeping it safely in lane and a suitable distance from the car in front the @entity13 claims to be the world ’s first ‘ highway autopilot ’ and can take control of car on a motorway , keeping it safely in lane and a suitable distance from the car in front			1
it comprises a rooftop sensor unit , computer in the boot and control panel next to the driver			1
the ' sensor pod ' relays what it detects back to the ‘ @entity41 computer ’ to make real - time decisions on where to position itself on the road			2
it uses computer vision and obstacle detection algorithms to work out where to place the car			0
if a car pulls in front suddenly , the system can brake and adjust the speed quickly			0
at launch , the @entity55 will only be available for @entity58 and @entity59 models built after 2012 - but more cars systems are in development			1
it can only currently be used in @entity63 and is not intended as a replacement for a driver			0
the gadget can be pre-ordered for $ 10,000 and is expected to be ready next year			1
the gadget , designed by @entity68 , comprises a rooftop sensor unit , computer in the boot and control panel next to the driver			1
it can be pre-ordered and is expected to be ready next year			0
by comparison , @entity6 has said that its automated cars will arrive between 2017 and 2020			2
@entity68 said : ‘ seven years ago i worked on an autonomous vehicle project but i was frustrated that the computational and sensing systems used were too expensive and too bulky to use … in a regular vehicle			0
’ so he designed the @entity79 , which sees the road and cars around a vehicle by using a sensor pod mounted on a car ’s roof			0
through a combination of sensors , cameras , radar , and other measurement systems , the ‘ sensor pod ’ relays what it detects back to the ‘ @entity41 computer ’ to make real - time decisions on where to position the car on the road			2
cruise control : the gadget , which comprises a rooftop sensor unit , computer in the boot and control panel next to the driver ( pictured ) , can be pre-ordered for $ 10,000 and is set to arrive next year the technology is reasonably cheap because it uses sensors already harnessed in other vehicles			1
‘ using advance computer vision and obstacle detection , the @entity109 keeps you in your lane and a safe distance from vehicles in front of you , ’ the company said			1
‘ it ’s always watching the road even if you are distracted - and frees you from the pain of commuting , stop - and - go traffic and long trips			0
just sit back and enjoy the ride			0
’ if the car sees danger or that a car has just cut in front , it can brake or change speed ‘ the radar allows us to determine the velocity and direction of any car around you to ensure there is enough distance for your car to come to a complete stop if there is ever a problem , ’ the company explained			0
the all - seeing eye : through a combination of sensors , cameras , radar , and other measurement systems , the ' sensor pod ' ( pictured ) relays what it detects back to the ' @entity41 computer ' to make real - time decisions on where to position itself on the road if the @entity109 is ‘ in doubt ’ about what it sees – such as sketchy lane markings – it alerts the driver using visual and sound alerts to ask them to take over driving completely			2
the system can be installed into any @entity58 or @entity59 built after 2012 , although the company plans to roll out versions for other cars next year			1
the autopilot can be turned on and off with a button integrated beside the driver , whereas the ‘ brains ’ of the system is stowed in the boot of a car and takes up less than two feet of space			2
currently , the system can only be used on major highways in @entity63 - specifically in the @entity173 , which has been mapped by the company , @entity171 reported			2
there are no plans to release it in the @entity178			0
the company stresses that its system is not a replacement for a driver , who must sit in the driver ’s seat and be prepared to take full control of the car at any time			0
‘ all state and federal driving laws still apply while the @entity109 is in operation , ’ it warned			0
brains in the boot : ' using advance computer vision and obstacle detection , the @entity109 keeps you in your lane and a safe distance from vehicles in front of you , ' the company says			1
it does this using sensors and a computer in the boot ( pictured ) that makes the calculations needed to drive the car			0

@entity6 's self - driving cars are expected to be ready by 2020
@entity212 's gadget , that drives cars on the motorway and keeps it at a safe distance from other vehicles , will be availble next year
it claims to be world 's first ‘ highway autopilot ’ and costs $ 10,000 ( £ 5,900 )
system uses rooftop sensors , a computer in the boot and a control panel
it is currently only available for new @entity58 and @entity59 models which must be driven in @entity63 - but devices for more cars are planned
