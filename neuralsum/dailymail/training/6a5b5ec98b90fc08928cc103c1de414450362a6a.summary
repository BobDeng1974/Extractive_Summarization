by @entity0 @entity1 realised in 2010 he could no longer hear the soft ' seep ' of a meadow pipit going over not being able to hear the high - pitched tweeting of birds might not matter very much to most people			1
but when you ’re @entity9 ’s best - known bird - lover , such hearing loss presents a rather serious problem — as @entity1 recently discovered			1
‘ i first noticed it when i was out on @entity19 bird watching four years ago — because what people do n’t realise is that a very high percentage of bird watching is actually bird listening , ’ says @entity1 , who came to fame in the zany tv series @entity14 in the @entity15 , but is now more closely associated with wildlife shows			1
‘ the first thing you do is listen and see what is singing or calling , then you track down the bird to look at it			0
i can recognise the call or song of most @entity9 species			0
‘ i was stood with a friend who said a meadow pipit was going over — it makes a soft “ seep ” sound — but i could n’t hear it			1
my friend said the call was quite loud and i suddenly realised that my hearing had gone			1
i had n’t suspected it at all before then but i went home and tested it by playing other high - pitched bird call recordings and i could n’t hear them either			1
’ the discovery was a huge blow for the former @entity47 presenter , 72 , who lives in @entity19 , with his wife @entity48 , 61 , and daughter @entity48 , 26			2
‘ i was really fed up about it as i ’ve always prided myself on having very keen ears , ’ says @entity1 , who also has two elder daughters and three grandchildren			1
‘ but the fact is that when you get to 50 your hearing does begin to deteriorate , and it is the top frequencies that go first			2
a lot of people might not notice it ever , unless you happen to like listening to birds or insects — though for some time i had found it hard to isolate whoever was speaking from general crowd noise			2
but it is the tragic descent that age brings ! ’ although @entity1 first noticed he had a hearing problem back in 2010 , he simply ignored the issue until relatively recently			1
‘ i did n’t want to admit it to myself , ’ he says			0
‘ when you get a subtle deterioration you tend to try and live with it			0
if your eyes are going it ’s fine to have to wear glasses or lenses , but there ’s a bit of stigma attached to saying you need hearing aids ; it invokes the spirit of a walking stick or frame — that you ’re on the way out			1
‘ my wife did on occasions ask me “ are you going deaf ? ” to which i ’d reply that it might help if she could speak up			0
then about six months ago i finally said to myself “ for goodness sake , hearing tests are free for everyone , see if you were right about the missing frequencies ” — and i was right			2
’ at a @entity98 hearing test , an audiologist played bird songs to investigate @entity1 ’s concerns			1
‘ rather embarrassingly , the audiologist played an app with bird calls on it and asked if i could hear the singing — and i had to say no , i could n’t			2
he could hear the sound but had no idea what it was , while i was the one who would have known what the song was but could n’t hear it			2
’ @entity1 was fitted for hearing aids in january and now wears a pair of ‘ behind the ear ’ aids that sit on the back of the ear			1
after years of putting it off , @entity1 had a hearing test - and was fitted with hearing aids in january ‘ suddenly i can hear the birds of @entity9 again , ’ he says			1
‘ i went out on the @entity19 the other day and there was a wonderful moment as i heard a meadow pipit calling , which i had n’t done for four or five years			0
to be able to hear the goldcrest again is excellent too — it ’s @entity9 ’s smallest bird and has one of the quietest songs			2
‘ the tree creeper is another i can hear again now — it ’s like a little mouse going up and down tree trunks and you nearly always hear its wispy song first ; without sound it ’s hard to see			2
’ though @entity1 had n’t noticed any other major problems , such as missing parts of conversations , he suspects he will now realise other sounds were absent too			1
‘ with sight loss , you know what you ’re missing as it ’s out of focus or distorted , but when you ca n’t hear you do n’t know what you ’re missing			2
if you have the slightest doubt about your hearing — even if you have n’t in fact – you should have a hearing test			2
’ the hearing aids are not easily visible and @entity1 feels no embarrassment in wearing them			1
‘ they are teeny weeny little things — friends have asked if i ’m wearing them as they ca n’t see them at all , ’ he says			0
‘ i have n’t found them difficult to get used to either ; i kept falling down stairs with contact lenses as they made my eyes water			0
i had the same problem with varifocals , which i ’ve used for several years now , as they made me feel the stairs were rising up to meet me			2
but these hearing aids are a doddle			1
‘ i do n’t wear them all the time , just out in the countryside ; frankly in my office i do n’t need to hear			0
my family are pleased about my hearing aids — though i ’m not sure how much they care when i come rushing in saying i can hear the goldcrest ! ’ meanwhile @entity1 ’s general health has also improved ; the crippling depression which saw him admitted to psychiatric hospital in 2009 — after he was dropped from @entity47 — has abated			1
although he suffers with bipolar disorder , he has not been really unwell since			0
‘ i ’ve been fortunate enough that i ’ve been absolutely fine for years now and have had a good stretch , ’ he says			0
@entity1 's general health has also improved - with his crippling depression which saw him admitted to psychiatric hospital in 2009 now under control ‘ i ’m still on medication — lithium for the bipolar and an antidepressant which i have been on for about ten years			1
it is the lithium that made the difference			0
‘ once you take something like that , basically you stick with it unless you absolutely do n’t need it any more			0
that ’s the same whether it ’s psychological or physical ; nobody wants to be on medication but if you know it helps and is keeping you going , why give it up ? i ’ve got friends determined to come off whatever medication they ’re on who keep causing themselves problems as they relapse — that sort of purism can be very destructive			0
’ @entity1 also tried ‘ mindfulness therapy ’ — a currently fashionable form of meditation said to improve mental health — but found it unhelpful			1
‘ mindfulness and cognitive therapy get a lot of publicity but my brief experience of a few classes — though it ’s not sold that way and you should do more — is that it really has n’t happened for me at all , ’ he says			0
‘ i giggle a lot			0
’ yet with its focus on awareness and being in the present moment , the practice of mindfulness is not entirely dissimilar to bird watching			0
could @entity1 ’s passion for birds have helped his health ? ‘ yes i think that ’s true — it ’s undeniable that being outdoors and having an interest in the outdoors is good for mental health in general , ’ he says			1
‘ there ’s no doubt that being involved with nature is good for you			0
’ @entity1 ’s eyesight has also deteriorated with age			1
he progressed from reading glasses at around the age of 50 to wearing glasses full - time a decade later when long - distance vision became difficult			0
he now wears bifocals and uses reading glasses for close work			0
‘ the battle in the case of the birdwatcher is how to make glasses work well with binoculars as you have to use both , ’ he says			1
‘ but manufacturers have become so sophisticated — now i have an extension on my binoculars that makes the eye - piece more acceptable to glasses — though i still wish i did n’t have them on rainy days when my glasses mist up			0
’ but for now it is being able to hear that is transforming his life			0
‘ people wonder what on earth i ’m doing , just standing on the @entity19 looking up — but we ’re actually listening for bird calls , especially at the moment , with the southern spring migrants			0
it ’s a lovely feeling ; spring will now not go racing by without me hearing it			0
’ @entity1 is encouraging people to have regular hearing tests , for information go to : specsavers.co.uk / hearing			1
@entity1 ’s online bird call hearing check will be launching late spring .			1

@entity1 , 72 , first realised he had a hearing problem in 2010
birdwatcher noticed he would *n't* hear the softer sounds birds make
@entity286 now wears hearing aids so he can hear them once more
