a man from @entity6 has launched a @entity8 campaign to track down an @entity10 woman he met at a @entity11 in @entity12 at the start of this year			1
@entity14 , 25 , from @entity15 , captured a photograph of the woman but knows little else about her - simply that her name is ' @entity18 ' and that she 's from @entity19 he explained that he was wandering around admiring the lights as he welcomed in 2013 when he spotted a girl crying at the side of the road and approached her			1
who is she ? @entity14 , right , has launched a @entity8 search for a woman named ' @entity18 ' , left , whom he met in @entity12 on @entity11			1
when they parted , she said : ' find me ' ' she was lost			1
she 'd lost all her friends , ' he told the @entity34			0
' i just cheered her up			0
i sort of have this undeniably bad sense of humor that no one can resist laughing at			0
' the pair spent the night dancing , drinking and chatting until 6 a.m. , when she reconnected with her friends and they parted ways			2
before she vanished into the night , she told him her name and that she lived in @entity45			0
she posed for a photograph and left him with a bold request : ' find me			1
' on a @entity8 campaign , he explained that the next morning he woke up and discovered the picture on his cell phone - ' and the good memories came sweeping back '			1
but he had few clues to track her down and when he tried to find her email address - he had some recollection of it containing the words ' kitty cat ' - he had no luck			2
he spent months looking for her and asked for help in a similar way on @entity8 in june			0
search : he launched a @entity8 search to find her - but so far he has not discovered who she is ' but the timing was n't right , ' he told the @entity34			2
' i think this time of year people have hope for the magic [ of @entity78 ]			2
' and it seems that people are catching on - with more than 4,000 people offering their support to him before he removed the @entity8 page			0
but while the story has gathered international attention - as well as questions over whether or not it is a hoax - the mysterious @entity18 has yet to be identified			1
before removing the @entity8 page , @entity14 explained why he was looking for her			1
' i was hurt a long time ago , ' he wrote			2
' the hopeless romantic in me was locked away when he got hurt because it was too much			0
for too long , this has effected my relationships , and i 've failed people			0
chance meeting : the pair met at @entity98 fireworks in @entity12 ( pictured ) when he spotted her crying alone and befriended her			2
they went on to dance and party before saying goodbye ' somewhere along the line my romantic soul went silent , and this is a step towards putting that right			0
' while the main aim of this event has been to reconnect with the now infamous " @entity18 " , it 's also about me , finding myself and who i know i can be			1
i hope to find her			0
and along the way , find myself			0
' but he said he has no illusions and that he would n't be surprised if @entity18 had another boyfriend but that he was ' foolishly optimistic '			1
' the chances are billions to one , but i like those odds , ' he wrote			0
' @entity117 is me putting all my chips on the table because it 's go hard or go home and i am not going to give in			0
