@entity1 ’s limited - overs future was looking a little brighter yesterday after @entity2 ’s third one - day century of the year and another sprightly innings from @entity4 inspired them to a five - wicket win over @entity6			1
a target of 240 turned out to be not so much the small mountain some had feared as a pleasant stroll in the @entity11 hills			0
tantalisingly , @entity1 now trail 3 - 2 with two games to play			1
just as important , the manner in which @entity2 and @entity4 — both nimble , inventive and busy — put on 104 in 21 overs for the third wicket lent weight to @entity1 ’s repeated insistence that they really are capable of playing a modern brand of one - day cricket			1
@entity1 's @entity2 bats during his country 's fifth one - day international against @entity6 @entity2 made a century as @entity1 kept their hopes of a series win alive with victory in @entity11 @entity2 , who eventually finished on 104 not out , celebrates reaching his century at the @entity26 @entity2 made an unbeaten 104 from 117 balls and @entity28 — four days after his morale - boosting 90 in @entity30 — as @entity1 turned in their most complete 50 - over performance since brushing aside the @entity32 in @entity33 in may			1
the result glossed over another patchy innings from @entity36 , who made 20 in 30 balls , but he could at least spend most of the post-match press conference answering questions about his two young team - mates rather than his own form			1
‘ @entity44 played a knock of equal class to @entity47 ’s 91 , ’ said the @entity1 captain			2
‘ @entity4 has taken his chance and played so well on two difficult wickets			2
i was a little concerned about the pitch this morning , but it did n’t make a difference			0
’ strictly speaking , of course , it was n’t a one - day international at all , spread , as it was , across wednesday and thursday by the weather			0
but that merely emphasised @entity1 ’s superiority here : mean with the ball on day one , when @entity61 claimed six wickets , and clinical with the bat on day two			2
play resumed with the @entity32 hoping to strangle @entity1 with their phalanx of spinners			1
and it seemed to be working			0
in the second over @entity70 charged at @entity71 and was bowled for four			0
and it was 35 for two when @entity36 was trapped in front by @entity71			0
recording his latest failure — and that ’s 57 international innings now without a century — has assumed the air of a bloodsport			0
@entity1 have already declared him their @entity81 captain of course , but pot - shots will continue to be taken until @entity36 successfully returns fire			1
@entity1 hero @entity2 leaves the field after helping @entity1 to their second win of the seven - game series @entity6 's @entity71 dives but fails to try stop @entity89 's low shot @entity91 ( left ) celebrates with team - mate @entity47 after taking the wicket of @entity4 i keep getting 20s and 30s , ’ he said			1
‘ that ’s more frustrating to me than it is to anyone else			0
’ conditions here bear little resemblance to what is expected at the @entity81 but @entity4 ’s innings oozed the deftness and adroit game - management that will do well on any surface			1
he scarpered the singles , swept with intent , and deposited @entity110 ’s off - spin over cow corner for six			0
but , as at @entity30 , a pair of sweat - soaked gloves appeared to bring about @entity4 ’s demise : an attempted pull off @entity91 provided a simple catch for @entity116 at long leg			1
but @entity2 was determined to see the job through			0
he and @entity89 added an untroubled 86 and , though @entity89 was caught with 15 needed , @entity2 was soon celebrating his hundred with a crowd - silencing slog - sweep for six			2
@entity122 threw his wicket away attempting the winning hit , but if @entity1 can repeat this result here tomorrow , their reward will be an unexpected series decider in @entity30 on tuesday			2
‘ this was a really important win for us , ’ said @entity36			2
‘ @entity30 has n’t been kind to us so far , but we ’ve won away from there			0
it would be great to get there at 3 - 3 and have a series final			1
’ that is not a sentence many were expecting @entity36 to be able to utter when this tour started			0
@entity1 captain @entity36 sprints to get some runs under his belt after pushing one into the legside @entity1 batsman @entity70 trudges off the field after being bowled by @entity71 early on @entity144 @entity1 cricketer @entity2 plays @entity145 on the ukulele			1

@entity2 scores 104 not out as @entity1 win the fifth odi in @entity149
@entity4 offered great support with *68*
@entity70 and @entity36 were both early for the tourists
@entity6 lead the series 3 - 2 with two matches left to play
