misfiring @entity1 striker @entity0 has admitted he faces an uncertain future – an eye - catching confession from a 31 - year - old who scored the most famous goal of his career in 2014 but begins 2015 with growing doubts over his form and fitness			1
the facts are these : @entity12 has 18 months left on his contract at @entity14 and has not been asked to hold any discussions about a new one			2
he is scoring a goal every 206.9 minutes in the @entity18 this season , compared to 120.1 minutes when he won the league for sir @entity20 in 2013 after a controversial move from @entity22			0
what happens next for @entity0 will be fascinating			2
to help him along , we lay down the five vastly - differing potential scenarios			0
@entity0 , in action for @entity1 against @entity28 , may not extend his @entity14 deal @entity12 has struggled - even though 2014 was the year of the most famous goal of his career 1 : @entity0 catches fire again and united give him a @entity34 the statistics suggest the best is behind @entity0			1
eight goals in 20 league games this season would satisfy some strikers , but not a player who scored 44 goals in all competitions for club and country in 2011 - 12 and followed up with 26 @entity18 goals when @entity1 won the title two seasons ago			1
and yet , @entity12 is a player you 'd be foolish to write off completely			1
we have been here before , at @entity22 he suffered 27 injuries in eight years – many connected with his problematic knee – and was written off as a very top player until he hit a purple patch of consistency from the early months of 2011 and never looked back			0
sir @entity20 broke his lifetime 's rule of not signing older players to pay @entity22 £ 24million for a striker pushing towards 30 and @entity0 paid him back with goal after goal			1
the @entity63 international could easily rediscover his form in the red of @entity1 this season @entity12 had become an almost overnight hit in @entity67 after the controversial move from @entity22 @entity69 , his former @entity63 coach , has praised @entity0 's intelligence and ability to create space for team - mates which is important in a squad packed with so many attacking stars			1
the goals are the one thing missing from his game but if @entity0 can rediscover his scoring touch – and his match - winning double at @entity81 six weeks ago suggests he still has the knack – @entity1 may be persuaded to the negotiating table with an offer that maintains his £ 200,000 - a - week pay packet			1
remember , it would n't cost them a transfer fee , and buying the next @entity12 would be very expensive			1
2 : @entity0 and united agree to run his contract down and he moves on the smart money is on this scenario happening			0
@entity12 will be just a couple of months off turning 33 when his current contract comes to an end in june 2016 and with @entity1 seemingly committed to finding the next batch of @entity100 , it is hard to see how an ageing centre forward with a strong sense of self - worth will fit in			1
at the same time , @entity12 offers enough to make him worth keeping for the duration of his current deal			0
he has shown himself comfortable on the big stage at @entity1 and he has the versatility of playing as no 9 or no 10 to play with @entity108 , @entity109 or @entity110			0
sir @entity20 signed @entity12 from the @entity111 back in the summer of 2012 @entity12 had become disenchanted at the @entity112 and could face a similar conclusion at @entity1 he is getting more injuries – ankle and knee problems this season have caused him to miss matches – and the evidence of your own eyes would suggest he is n't as mobile as the @entity12 of old			1
but his spectacular diving header for @entity63 against @entity124 at the @entity125 last summer indicates he is still capable of producing magic few can replicate , which is why @entity1 wo n't ideally be in a hurry to terminate his deal early			1
@entity12 on a @entity130 in 18 months would be attractive to a number of @entity133 clubs and affordable to @entity135 clubs if he wanted to return home			1
3 : van @entity137 gets frustrated and decides @entity0 should leave in the summer @entity139 has a lot of jigsaw pieces to fit in at @entity14			0
when he arrived in the summer , it was assumed his compatriot @entity12 would be top dog and possibly even the club 's new captain , but that has n't happened			2
@entity108 has been chosen as the team 's leader and it 's lucky for @entity0 that @entity109 has n't hit the ground running in @entity153 football , otherwise his first - team place might have been in more jeopardy			2
so far , the @entity1 manager has tried all kind of mind games to get the best out of @entity12 , praising him some weeks , then demanding more			1
but if @entity139 wants to buy @entity109 on a permanent basis – the @entity161 did miss the second half of last season through injury and so should improve over the next few months – cuts may need to be made elsewhere			0
@entity69 has always been a fan of @entity12 but could grow impatient with the striker @entity12 is one of the big earners and if @entity1 want to splash out on the likes of @entity170 and maybe even @entity171 , even they ca n't afford to pay everyone £ 10m a year			1
@entity139 has often said he treats players on their performances , not reputation , and took off @entity12 during matches at the @entity125			2
@entity0 has scored only once in his last six games , and missed a good chance against @entity179 in the @entity180 last week			2
4 : @entity0 becomes frustrated and decides he should leave in the summer like a lot of @entity135 players , @entity12 intelligent , opinionated and not shy to come forward with what he wants and expects in his career			1
even under sir @entity20 , he was confident enough to say publicly he did n't like team rotation and felt he played better when he played consecutive matches to establish a rhythm in his game			0
@entity20 was very clever and never left @entity12 out even when he went a few games without scoring			0
he understood the striker was good enough to be treated as an exception , as he had done years previously with @entity195			0
@entity12 ( pictured at @entity28 on friday night ) could become frustrated and leave @entity14 there is no reason why @entity139 wo n't give @entity110 ( right ) an extended run in the first team the trouble is @entity12 is no longer good enough to be treated differently to anyone else			1
besides his slump in goalscoring , he is credited with only two @entity18 assists this season			0
if @entity109 improves and @entity139 wants to give @entity110 more of a chance , @entity12 will not be an automatic starter in every game , and that might be something the player finds difficult to handle			2
in the summer , he will have just a year left on his contract			0
he managed to extricate himself from @entity22 in similar circumstances			0
5 : @entity214 accepts a downgrade from a-list to b - list and becomes a long - term united club man @entity1 holds a special allure to players			0
whereas @entity224 has decided to leave @entity225 rather than accept a pay cut and more infrequent appearances to stay , @entity222 and @entity223 did exactly that in their later days			0
both men understood in their thirties they could no longer be the first names on the team sheet , but they signed contracts that reflected that , because they wanted to stay			0
@entity12 could accept a downgrade to a b - list player and sit on the substitutes bench under @entity139 @entity225 's @entity224 has opted for a move to the @entity238 with @entity239 in the summer @entity12 is n't homegrown of course but there is evidence he and his family have settled in the north west where his children attend school with the offspring of many other @entity1 players and other footballers ; @entity108 , @entity251 and @entity252 – whom @entity0 knew at @entity22 – among them			1
there is a scenario where @entity0 will be welcomed to stay at @entity14 beyond his current deal provided he is happy to be a squad player rather than the main man and maybe be paid £ 100,000 - a - week rather than 200,000			2
from the club 's point of view , to have someone of @entity12 's experience to help guide the younger players would be ideal			0
@entity20 signed @entity263 on a free towards the end of his career , @entity263 did n't play much , but the @entity1 manager thought he was fantastic to have around the training ground .			2

@entity0 may not remain a @entity1 player
the striker admitted his performances have n't been good enough
a number of scenarios lie in store for @entity12 as he makes next move
