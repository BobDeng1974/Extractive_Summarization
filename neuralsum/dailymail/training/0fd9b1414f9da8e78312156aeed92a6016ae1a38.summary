a key @entity1 lawmaker threatened congressional hearings on tuesday over the @entity5 administration 's lack of action to confront @entity7 , the @entity8 terror group responsible for beheading two @entity10 journalists and distributing the gory videos			1
@entity13 rep. @entity12 , the @entity15 's ranking @entity14 , said during a conference call with reporters that he and @entity20 committee chair rep. @entity21 plan to call hearings this month to oversee the president 's airstrike campaign against the @entity8 group in @entity26 and bring some focus to the @entity29 's strategic thinking			1
' the threat of @entity7 is just something that i believe very strongly that we can not take lightly , ' @entity12 said of the terrorist self - proclaimed @entity34			2
' we can not dither , we can not just twiddle our thumbs , or wait and see , ' he insisted			0
' we have to act and we have to act soon			0
the more countries that we can get in this crusade to destroy terrorism ... the better it will be			0
' vice president @entity40 followed on wednesday with war drums in @entity42 , @entity43 , saying the @entity10 would follow @entity7 ' to the gates of hell			1
' we do n’t forget			0
' ' we take care of those who are grieving , and when that ’s finished , they should know , we will follow them to the gates of hell until they are brought to justice			0
because hell is where they will reside ! @entity75 is where they will reside ! ' @entity78 , a @entity79 freelancer for @entity81 and @entity82 magazines , was shown in the terrorists ' footage following a message blaming @entity5 's continuing airstrikes for his fate			1
@entity78 and @entity88 , a @entity10 photojournalist executed in a similar fashion on a video released in august , were believed to be held in @entity91 , where a growing @entity7 army maintains control over much of the nation 's eastern territories			1
under the @entity96 of 1973 , the @entity29 ca n't send the @entity10 military into armed conflict for more than 60 days without congressional authorization			1
that clock will run out on october 7			0
president @entity5 said wednesday in @entity55 that fighting @entity7 ' is not going to be a one - week or one - month or six - month proposition			1
' @entity21 and @entity12 , the @entity103 reported , said that in the wake of a second gruesome video showing the beheading of an @entity10 journalist , they 're determined to make sure the administration is proceeding in a way that @entity52 approves of			1
@entity111 @entity110 rep. @entity110 went one step further on wednesday , unveiling a bill that he will soon introduce to authorize ongoing military force against @entity7 and other @entity8 terror groups			1
the proposed legislation would permit @entity5 ' to use all necessary and appropriate force against those countries , organizations , or persons associated with or supporting terrorist groups , including @entity122 and its regional affiliates , the @entity34 and @entity91 , @entity124 , @entity125 , and any other emerging regional terrorist groups that share a common violent extremist ideology			2
' his goal , articulated in the bill , is ' to eliminate all such terrorist groups			0
' a separate bill drafted by @entity79 sen. @entity132 would give president @entity5 the legal authority to carry out airstrikes on @entity7 in @entity91			1
' let there be no doubt , we must go after @entity7 right away because the @entity10 is the only one that can put together a coalition to stop this group that ’s intent on barbaric cruelty , ' the @entity1 lawmaker said in a statement			1
both @entity110 and @entity132 intend to file their legislation next week when @entity52 reconvenes after a month - long recess			2
flashpoint : @entity148 released tuesday by the self - proclaimed @entity34 ( @entity7 ) showed @entity10 journalist @entity78 ( left ) next to an unknown jihadi shortly before his execution @entity12 ( left ) and @entity21 ( right ) were on the air tuesday as news of @entity78 's execution reached @entity154 @entity110 said wednesday that ' for far too long the @entity155 and the @entity52 have been debating whether or not authority exists for action to address this threat			1
' ' we can not continue operating on outdated authorities passed 13 years ago ; it is time for this @entity52 to vote , ' he said			0
@entity110 's bill includes a sop to dovish @entity1 in the form of a requirement that the president must act with ' the close consultation , coordination , and cooperation with @entity170 and regional allies			2
' at the heart of lawmakers ' concerns is the thorny question of whether @entity5 will authorize airstrikes against @entity7 in @entity91 as well as @entity26			2
' we anticipate there will be a vote on authorization of the use of force for such a plan , ' @entity21 said tuesday			0
' that would come within the 60 - day window			0
' we believe that before the president can continue beyond 60 days of doing airstrikes in @entity26 or anyplace else , he would have to come to @entity52 and get @entity52 ’s authority to continue , ' he said			1
the president admitted last thursday that ' we do n't have a strategy yet ' for that the confession elicited gasps from lawmakers from the president 's own political party			0
@entity199 sen. @entity198 said on tuesday in a letter to attorney general @entity201 that he was ' troubled ' by @entity5 's admission			1
in a statement released tuesday virgina sen. @entity204 called on the president to present @entity52 ' with a clear strategy and political and military options for eliminating the @entity34 threat			2
' ' the @entity10 should not take any military options off the table , because stopping @entity34 is in the national security and foreign policy interests of the @entity10 and our @entity215 allies , ' @entity204 's statement read			2
@entity5 has unequivocally said the @entity10 will not put combat boots on the ground in @entity26 to fight @entity34 extremists			1
on wednesday in @entity55 , after nearly a week - long media feeding frenzy that delivered one @entity224 black eye after another , the president tried to clarify what he meant by his no strategy remark			0
' i was specifically referring to the possibility of the military strategy inside of @entity91 that might require congressional approval , ' he said during a press conference			0
' it is very important from my perspective that when we send our pilots in to do a job , that we know that this is a mission that 's going to work , that we 're very clear on what our objectives are , what our targets are ; we 've made the case to @entity52 and we 've made the case to the @entity10 people ; and we 've got allies behind us so that it 's not just a one - off , but it 's something that over time is going to be effective			1
' mixed messages : @entity251 met with newly appointed envoy to @entity254 communities @entity255 ( right ) during a @entity257 ceremony on tuesday @entity21 also told reporters on tuesday that he and @entity12 plan on ' scheduling a hearing upon our return and requesting the secretary of state to present a plan , a strategy focused on rolling back @entity7 , defeating @entity7 through the use of airstrikes and the support of those with common interests			1
' @entity271 @entity20 sen. @entity270 , the vice chairman of the @entity272 , joined the impatience caucus on wednesday by insisting that ' the @entity10 must destroy @entity34 [ @entity274 ] now			0
' ' the @entity275 can not continue to stand by while this group continues to kill innocent persons , as it has already done with the appalling murders of @entity88 and @entity78 , ' he said			0
' the time to stop and destroy @entity34 is now			0
' secretary of state @entity251 took nearly 24 hours to comment on @entity78 's death , saying in a statement wednesday morning that it was ' an act of medieval savagery by a coward hiding behind a mask			1
' his emailed statement came shortly before he presided over a ceremony to honor @entity255 , his special envoy to @entity10 @entity254 communities			0
' for so many who worked so long to bring @entity78 and the other @entity10 home safely , this was not how the story should 've ended , ' @entity251 said			2
' its a punch to the gut			0
' [ @entity296 ] hose who have murdered @entity88 and @entity78 in @entity91 , ' he vowed , ' should know that the @entity10 will hold them accountable too , no matter how long it takes			0
' @entity21 ( left ) and @entity12 ( right ) met with @entity300 pm @entity299 ( center ) on tuesday in @entity300 but @entity21 , the more hawkish of the two congressmen who spoke to reporters tuesday , stopped short of calling for massive bombing campaigns trailing through @entity91 airspace			0
that could indicate that @entity251 and other @entity5 administration officials will have a hard time justifying additional airstrikes without also arming @entity311 groups on the ground			2
the @entity29 needs to ' accelerate this process , ' @entity21 said , suggesting that the @entity10 should be arming the moderate @entity314 to fight @entity7			1
he also criticized the administration for its plodding approach to arming the @entity319 @entity318 army in northern @entity26			0
@entity5 said wednesday that the primary @entity10 objective ' is to degrade and destroy ' @entity7 ' so that it ’s no longer a threat not just to @entity26 but also the region and to the @entity10			1
' but in the same press conference , he said a successful @entity10 effort in the region would ' shrink ' the group 's ' sphere of influence , its effectiveness , its financing , its military capabilities to the point where it is a manageable problem			2

@entity13 @entity1 rep. @entity12 says the @entity15 will hold hearings this month to demand *oversight* of @entity7 fight
@entity40 boomed at @entity7 that ' @entity75 is where they will live '
*federal* law limits the @entity29 to 60 days of armed fighting overseas without an authorization from @entity52 ; that clock runs out on oct. 7
secretary of state @entity251 will likely be called as a witness in hearings
a @entity111 congressman will introduce a bill authorizing ongoing military force against @entity7 and other @entity8 terror groups
fights in @entity355 over @entity5 's *cautious* approach have *intensified* since a second video *surfaced* showing the beheading of a @entity10 journalist
