most people might believe that being covered in face tattoos would make it impossible to land a job ; but for one inked - up @entity11 man the decision to cover his head , neck and arms in crude body art has actually earned him a lucrative career as a model			1
@entity15 , 24 , gained notoriety last year for his tattoo - covered visage and his dreams of becoming the most famous man in the world ; despite facing heavy criticism about his unique ink , @entity23 insisted that the @entity27 - like tattoos on his face , neck , chest , and arms ' embody pop culture ' , create ' a myth , a mystery ' and would one day help him to achieve his goal of global fame			1
and while many may have doubted his chances of succeeding , it seems his unique look has actually started to pay off , as the @entity42 - based model has landed a campaign for underwear brand @entity44			1
' you could look at me in a hundred years from now and really get the idea of what pop culture was like in the early 2010s , ' he told @entity75 last year , adding that the words and phrases he chooses are inspired by @entity79 songs , places , and other ' superficial ' things			0
' i want to be an image for people to look at , something that has an impact , ' he says			0
' everybody who sees me is bound to ask questions : “ why fame ? what ’s his life like ? ” ' art history : @entity23 says he got his first tattoo around the age of 16 ; it 's the logo for @entity95 on his chest flashing his fame : one of his most prominent tattoos , the word ' fame ' written across his forehead summarizes @entity23 's biggest goal @entity23 's extensive body art has taken him years to cultivate — while he now has 24 tattoos on his face and others on his arms , neck , chest , legs , and stomach , he started with a single rendering of the @entity95 logo when he was 16			1
he also insists that his tattoos are real , and has gone so far as to prove the designs are permanent by filming himself washing up , in order to show that the ink does n’t come off when scrubbed			0
' if i was indecisive , i do n’t think i would write on my face , ' he explains			0
do n't forget this face : @entity23 likes that his many tattoos make him memorable and thinks they make him a ' myth ' and a ' mystery ' adding them up : @entity23 has 24 tattoos on his face alone , including the words ' guilty ' , ' play ' , and ' famous ' before breaking into modeling , @entity23 worked at a supermarket where he says he ' wanted to die ' ; now he hopes to build an empire and bring a paparazzi culture to his hometown of @entity42 because he is disappointed that the city does n't have a ' star system '			2
he also designs wallets , which he sells for $ 98 on his newly - launched website			0
@entity23 is not the first heavily - tattooed model to use his body art to earn modelling gigs ; photographer @entity141 recently released a book called @entity143 that features women covered in ink .			2
