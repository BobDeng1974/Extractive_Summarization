@entity1 manager @entity0 wants to sign two midfielders and a striker before the transfer window closes			1
rangers have so far added four new recruits to the squad but @entity0 has been left short after players were released and last year 's loanees returned to their parent clubs			1
@entity0 has already signed @entity11 and @entity12 from @entity13 , @entity14 from @entity15 and @entity16 on loan from @entity18			1
' i 've got three central midfield players - @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 - when you need six midfield players really at this level			0
' so we 're looking to get one or two midfielders in and maybe a front man as well because we need a bit of cover there			2
you need four strikers in an ideal world			0
' @entity0 added : ' if you look at the whole squad with everyone fit we 've got 18 or 19 outfield players and that includes one or two lads who could n't get in the squad last year			1
' helping hand : @entity54 midfielder @entity53 made a significant contribution to @entity1 's promotion @entity57 used the loan system to their advantage last season in the @entity61 as the likes of @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity53 all made significant contributions			1
' we 'll probably use the loan system again			0
maybe we 'll buy one and loan a couple , ' @entity0 said after @entity1 were beaten 1 - 0 by @entity70 at @entity71 on saturday			1
' i think the chairman is close to doing a couple of deals today , i 'm hoping he is			0
' i spoke to him before the game and he 's confident he 'll get another couple that i 'm after			0
' uncertain : @entity78 striker @entity20 could still leave the club before the transfer window closes the future of @entity20 , who came close to joining @entity82 earlier in the transfer window , is still uncertain			1
the @entity78 forward is keen to leave @entity71 but is waiting to be approached by a club who can challenge for a @entity88 spot			2
' he 's got a buy - out clause which is a problem , because if someone comes in and offers the money you lose him , ' @entity0 said			2
' if he goes you 're looking for two strikers , which is n't easy to find , but if he 's going to leave @entity1 , it 's got to be to a big club - a top - seven club i would think			2
' he did n't want to go back to @entity99 which is a massive club , so unless it 's a club in the top seven i do n't think he 'll go			0
' on the move : @entity103 are hoping to agree a deal to take @entity105 to the @entity106 one player who does look set to leave is goalkeeper @entity105			0
the 34 - year - old , who joined @entity57 in august 2012 , was due to hold talks with @entity103 over the weekend with a view to completing a transfer			0
@entity0 's side will be looking to bounce back from their opening day defeat when they travel to @entity115 on sunday			1
the fixture means a return to @entity118 for @entity0 , who was sacked by @entity115 in june 2012			1
' it 's a tough game but i 'm looking forward to going back there , ' @entity0 said			2
' they 'll be strong this year			0
with the money they spent last year they 've got to be pushing for the top four			0
