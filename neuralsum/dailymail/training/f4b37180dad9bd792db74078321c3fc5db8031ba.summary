with the sun on our skin , more of our bodies exposed , lazy afternoons at the pub fuelled by gallons of @entity4 it 's really no surprise that our libidos lift during summer			2
it might not look attractive but it can mean they 're a great lover ! he owns a dog they 're used to putting others needs first ( handy in bed for you ! ) and used to dealing with doggy drools and moulting hair , so unlikely to be a hygiene freak ( the ultimate turn - off in bed )			1
he 's no @entity51 if he 's not terribly good - looking , he 's not innundated with women pressing their bodies against @entity54 it 's likely he 'll spend time and effort keeping the ones that do , happy			0
he 's got loopy handwriting according to handwriting specialists , people who sign a lowercase ' y ' with a flourish in the tail have high libidos and lots of imagination			1
he smells ... divine smell is one of the indicators of attraction and the better he smells to you , the more genetically complementary the two of you may be			0
he 's erect as in stands up straight ! posture is indicative of laziness			1
if he stands with shoulders back and tummy in , he 'll make an effort			0
good posture also usually means the person is confident			1
@entity23 says that even small gestures like having flexible thumbs can give away a lot about what a man is like in bed he is n't scared to take the mickey out of himself anyone who can laugh at themselves out of bed , is going to be unselfconscious in it			1
if his humour is self - deprecating , it 's a great sign he does n't take himself too seriously and is n't ego - centred			1
he 's bi-lingal it 's a very good sign if he speaks more than one language because it implies intelligence and effort : he 's willing to work hard for rewards			1
a fab attribute in a long - term lover ! he gets road rage he 'll be an impatient lover who 's obsessed with the final destination ( orgasm - his ) and uninterested in the travelling ( usually when you get yours )			1
if he 's a fast driver , fasten your seatbelt but go along for the ride : it usually means he 's passionate and into lusty , wanton sex			1
steer clear of cautious , slower - than - your - granny type drivers - even she 'd want more action ! he 's set in his daily routine if he hyperventilates when forced to catch the 6.05 rather than the 6.03 , it 's a bit of a worry sexually			0
he 's robotic and so stinks of predictability : chances are he makes love in exactly the same way , every single time ( and do n't even think about moving an inch to the left or he 'll wonder what 's wrong )			0
it 's one thing to find something good and stick to it , but it does help if he 's flexible enough to mould to your needs			0
he 's attached at the hip - to his friends the fact that he only moves as one means he 'll be a nervous lover			1
he 'd need lots of encouragement and approval before he 'll relax because he 's probably not terribly good at thinking for himself			0
if you 're a dominant lover and do n't mind playing teacher , go for it ! if you know what you want , he 'll fit in with you			2
but do n't expect any surprises : he 's probably got a few techniques down pat , but he 's too scared to take a risk and veer into unchartered kingdoms			0
@entity150 's talks with his hands if he 's using big , sweeping , dramatic movements , it probably translates well into the bedroom			0
it usually means he 's imaginative and creative and will want sex to be a ' production '			0
he 's got flexible thumbs see if he measures up to the ultimate sex flex by pulling his thumb : the ancient @entity161 believed the more flexible it is , the more adventurous the lover			2
if you can hardly pull his thumb away from the main body of the palm , he 's a straight , conservative lover			2
the further it flexes , the more bent he becomes			0
take a good look at it while you 're there : a large or long and heavy thumb means he 's got vast amounts of sexual energy and likes to take control			2
short thumbs are n't fab ( weak - willed ) but thumbs set very low on his hand are - this guy 's sexually unconventional and highly adventurous			0
