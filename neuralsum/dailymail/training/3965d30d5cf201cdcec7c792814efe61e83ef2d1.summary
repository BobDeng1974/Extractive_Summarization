by @entity0 her creations became a hit with a-listers , including @entity4 and princess @entity5 , and in 1998 a pair made their way into the script of @entity10 - turning @entity9 into a household name overnight			1
after leaving the luxury label that she founded and managed between 1996 and 2011 - she sold her shares for £ 82.5 million - ms @entity15 has unveiled her very own collection of totes , ready - to - wear and , of course , shoes			1
and there 's a certain piece in her collection that is really causing a stir : her £ 1,595 ' @entity27 ' leather legging boots - which have been worn by none other than @entity31 , teamed with a @entity33 leather ruffled skirt			1
debut shoe : @entity15 , who left @entity9 in 2011 , has unveiled her £ 1,595 leather legging boots - appropriately named @entity37 would you dare to wear them ? the legging boots are being sold on high - end fashion site , @entity42 , and @entity15 says they 're ' flying off the shelves ' the £ 1,595 leather legging boots are a far cry from a dainty pair of @entity47			1
@entity15 describes her leather creation as ' a thigh boot that pulls right up into a legging			1
you can wear a sweater over it or a big man 's shirt and there 's no gap			0
' @entity42 , which is selling the shoe / legging hybrid , writes : ' designed for a flawless , all - in - one silhouette , each size of this unique style is constructed with either a @entity63 / s or @entity64 pant - wear yours with a fitted tunic for the slickest take			1
' in an interview with @entity69 yesterday , @entity15 says the boots are flying off the shelves and while the buyers are mostly young women , one lady in her late sixties snapped up a pair			1
daring : @entity76 ( @entity64 ) describes her leather creation ( r ) , which is a far cry from a dainty @entity9 , as ' a thigh boot that pulls right up into a legging ' the capsule collection also includes a £ 725 leather tote , £ 550 stretch - wool piqué straight - leg pants and £ 830 fringed wrap - effect leather skirt			1
and her designs are winning over the fashion world : she 's set to open her online shop in @entity88 and she 's planning on opening outlets in @entity90 and @entity91 next year before expanding into @entity92 and the @entity94 - @entity93 even wore a pair of her snakeskin metallic blue sandals at the @entity99 auditions in @entity100			2
her debut range comes soon after @entity15 told how her business partner did not design a single shoe for the multi-million dollar brand named after him			2
the businesswoman has re-released her memoir , in her shoes , in a paperback version			1
in it , @entity76 opens up about her life in the fast lane and reveals the business and life lessons she will pass onto her daughter			0
during an interview last year on the today show , the 46 - year - old revealed that she never received a sketch from him during the years they worked together ; ' not one ' , she clarified			2
of course she 's wearing them ! @entity31 , who has a penchant for leather , has been spotted wearing the quirky design unaware of mr @entity9 's lack of design nous when they joined forces , she said that she had to quickly hone her skills and use experience from her fashion writing days as accessories editor at @entity134 to guide her			1
noting her increasing bitterness about the situation , she writes in her memoirs : ' by the end of 2000 , @entity9 was turning a profit of around £ 3 million a year			1
' we had our own @entity90 boutique and were represented at 450 more stores , including @entity143 and @entity144			0
' to top it off , we 'd won a @entity146 , which @entity9 insisted on accepting on our behalf , even though his design contribution had been nil ' work the look : @entity42 , who are selling the shoe , write : ' designed for a flawless , all - in - one silhouette - wear yours with a fitted tunic for the slickest take ' not a design man : ms @entity15 said that mr @entity9 , seen with a fashion student , was a skilled cobbler but lacked creative spark design process : ms @entity15 said that she would come up with ideas and mr @entity9 's niece , ms @entity161 would sketch them out and the two of them would go to vintage stores to look for inspiration ms @entity15 said from there her relationship with mr @entity9 deteriorated to the point that any conversation was ' out of the question '			1
in my shoes : ms @entity15 offers a glimpse into her eventful life in her re-leased memoir , in her shoes in 2001 , after much confrontation , mr @entity9 sold his share in the company in 2001			1
ms @entity15 , who remained with the firm until 2011 , said the years that followed were tough as she dealt with the death of her father in 2004 and a divorce from her ' playboy ' husband in 2005			1
while it might have been more sensible for ms @entity15 to have gone into business alone , she admits that she met mr @entity9 after going through a rough period in her life			1
' one glass of wine for me turned into 6 o’clock in the morning and calling the coke dealer and then realizing , " @entity199 , i 've got to be at work in three hours , ' " she recalled			0
after losing her job at @entity134 at the age 27 , ms @entity15 entered rehab			2
the experience marked a turning point for her			0
she emerged determined to pursue her dream of starting her own shoe business			0
that ’s when she reached out to mr @entity9 , a cobbler from @entity90 ’s @entity210 whom she knew from her @entity134 days			2
today , armed with a wealth of business experience , she has finally unveiled her own namesake label - and @entity15 says she ’s the happiest she has ever been , and credits much of it to her daughter @entity217 , 12			1
despite not even reaching her teenage years yet , @entity218 - known more fondly as ' @entity219 ' - is wasting no time learning the ropes so that she can one day follow in her mother ’s own fabulous footsteps			0
like mother , like daughter : @entity15 , right , and @entity76 , left , at a film premiere in june			2
@entity15 says her daughter loves fashion and has great style ‘ she travels everywhere with me and sits in on all my meetings , ’ @entity15 tells @entity229			2
‘ she ’s learning about what i do from osmosis , from actually doing it			0
and i think that ’s the best education			0
it ’s giving her confidence and experience			0
if she has an idea , she contributes			0
’ she continues : ‘ my daughter and i bond over the business and decided , together , she ’s going to travel with me and be in on my meetings			0
‘ it ’s such a great way for us to bond			0
i love having her with me , i hate leaving her behind			0
’ whether @entity219 will take over the reigns from her mother one day is still to be decided , however			0
‘ it ’s a little early still , ’ laughs @entity15			2
‘ but she loves fashion			0
she ’s got strong opinions , which i like			0
' it ’s very good , though i do n’t get a say in what she wears			0
unless she asks for my advice , i stay out of it ! ‘ if there was a stage that she was wearing really inappropriate clothing then i would put my foot down , thankfully we have n’t hit that bridge yet ! ’ famous fan : @entity93 , who is one of @entity88 's favourite style icons , wore a pair of @entity76 's £ 825 shoes at the @entity99 auditions in @entity100 in my shoes by @entity15 is out now in paperback , @entity270 , £ 9.99 stretch - wool piqué straight - leg pants , £ 550 wool - blend pencil skirt , £ 460 @entity275 leopard - print calf hair and elaphe pumps , £ 595 chill out metallic leather sandals , £ 325 fringed wrap - effect leather skirt £ 830 stretch - wool piqué blazer , £ 740			1
