by @entity0 published : 20:52 est , 4 december 2013 updated : 20:52 est , 4 december 2013 ministers are hoping to halt the creep of wind farms across the countryside by offering larger cash incentives to build them at sea			1
@entity7 has secured a 5 per cent cut in wind power subsidies amid increasing concerns about the hostility turbines have caused in rural areas , and to head off a revolt by @entity15 mps			1
but the green levies paid to companies building them off the coast – and out of sight – will increase slightly in the coming years			0
controversial : the turbines have caused hostility in rural areas it does not mean there will be no new turbines on land , where there are already more than 4,000 , but sources close to the chancellor said that ‘ protecting our natural environment ’ was a key factor in the decision			1
payments to unpopular large solar farms – but not household solar panels – will also go down			1
treasury chief secretary @entity36 said the cuts were due to manufacturing costs falling			0
but renewable @entity39 , which represents the wind industry , warned ministers against making these decisions for ‘ political reasons rather than economic ones ’ and said some smaller community - led wind farms onshore would be ‘ lost ’ as a result			2
household bills will not fall as a result of the changes yesterday , as other forms of green energy will now win higher subsidies			2
@entity54 , of the @entity56 think - tank : said : ‘ we must wean renewable energy off the subsidy drip			0
’ but he called for the government to scrap its target to generate 20 per cent of energy from renewables by 2020 , as it ‘ pushes up bills and means we are n’t cutting carbon emissions in the cheapest way ’			0
providers of green energy are given a fixed price for every unit of electricity they generate , and prices for the next five years were published yesterday by the @entity74			0
the market price for power is around £ 50 per megawatt hour , but the government says they need a subsidy to compete with coal and gas			0
onshore wind , which was due to be paid £ 100 per megawatt hour ( @entity82 ) from next year , will now get £ 95 , going down to £ 90 by 2017 - 18			0
solar farms will get £ 120 per @entity82 , down from £ 125			1
but wind turbines at sea will get £ 155 per mwh going down to £ 140 in three years ’ time			2
' protecting our natural environment ' : ministers hope the changes will mean more wind farms are built at sea the @entity74 said : ‘ this will support the growth of the offshore wind industry			1
’ @entity95 , of the @entity96 , said : ‘ any slowing down in the rate of growth of onshore wind is good news			0
’ but the @entity102 ’ @entity101 said the increase in subsidies for offshore wind – which is more expensive than nuclear power – was a ‘ catastrophe for families struggling with their bills			1
