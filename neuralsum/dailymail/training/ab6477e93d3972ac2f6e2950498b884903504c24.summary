two polar bears fight in the snow by @entity3 in @entity4 , @entity5 , as captured by wildlife photographer @entity7 the moisture flying from the nine foot - tall bears catches the sun on a perfect winter 's day in @entity5 while play fighting , the young polar bears look ferocious when they rise onto their back legs the powerful carnivores push each other on the shore of the bay while they wait for the ice to form over the water ' they would usually just be lying around and one would roll over and start pawing at the other			1
' from there they would push and shove each other going fully on hind legs every so often			0
there would be a lot of biting and gnawing			0
' this scene was an early birthday gift for @entity7 , who turned 56 the day after witnessing this hour - long play fight			2
' they would sometimes hold each others head in the snow for a few seconds as if on a count and then start it all over again , ' @entity7 recalls			2
' i was in awe of the power of the animals and the amazingly clear day with the most extraordinary light			0
up until that point we had had some terrible weather - blizzards and very grey days			0
the sharp bottom teeth of the bear on the left are primed to show the one on the right who 's boss as if @entity20 like humans ( aside from the biting ) the bears take each other to the ground to show their strength the bears spent an hour fighting , says the photographer , before walking off into the sun together ' it was also preternaturally quiet as the bears made no sound when they fought each other			1
' the only sound you would hear was the sound of snow going " oomph " when the bears hit each other and the respectful murmurs of the human beings feeling privileged to watch such a spectacle			0
' not only is the light incredible , i love the small details in the photos - the texture of their fur , the blood shot eyes and their teeth			0
