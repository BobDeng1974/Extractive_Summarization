@entity0 has been accused of deleting all her emails while under subpoena			0
the allegation , leveled by a @entity5 chairman for a @entity6 on @entity7 , is the latest in a series of claims that are hammering the former first lady 's reputation as 2016 approaches			1
in a letter released on friday night , rep @entity13 , @entity15 , said the former secretary of state has failed to produce a single new document in recent weeks and has refused to relinquish her server to a third party for an independent review			2
@entity0 's attorney , @entity23 , rubbished the claims			1
the @entity7 committee demanded further documents and access to the server after it was revealed that @entity0 used a private email account and server during her tenure at @entity46			1
house speaker @entity47 has not ruled out a vote in the @entity49 to force @entity0 to turn over the server if she declines to make it available by @entity13 's april 3 deadline			0
in a six - page letter released late on friday , @entity23 defended @entity0 , saying she had turned over all work - related emails to the @entity56			2
that included everything sent or received during her tenure as secretary of state from 2009 to 2013			0
' the @entity56 is therefore in possession of all secretary @entity0 's work - related emails from the ( personal email ) account , ' @entity23 wrote			1
@entity23 also said it would be pointless for @entity0 to turn over her server , even if legally authorized , since ' no emails ... reside on the server or on any backup systems associated with the server			0
' rep. @entity73 of @entity74 , the top @entity75 on the @entity7 panel , said @entity23 's letter confirmed ' what we all knew : that @entity0 already produced her official records to the @entity56 , that she did not keep her personal emails and that the @entity82 has already obtained her emails relating to the attacks in @entity7			1
' dispute : the claims come as the former secretary of state defends her use of a private email system no take two ? analysts warn the saga could have a devastating affect on @entity0 's approval ratings before the 2016 presidential race , which could hamper her chances of a second @entity97 stint with husband @entity98 @entity73 said it is time for @entity13 and other @entity5 to stop what he called a ' political charade ' and instead make @entity0 's emails public			1
@entity13 also should schedule @entity0 's public testimony before the @entity7 panel as soon as possible , @entity73 said			1
@entity23 said in his letter that @entity0 's personal attorneys reviewed every email sent and received from her private email address — 62,320 emails in total — and identified all work - related emails			1
those totaled 30,490 emails or approximately 55,000 pages			0
the material was provided to the @entity56 on december 5 , 2014 , and it is the agency 's discretion to release those emails after a review			2
@entity23 said @entity0 has asked for the release of all of those emails			0
he said the @entity56 is reviewing the material to decide whether any sensitive information needs to be protected			0
' @entity0 is not in a position to produce any of those emails to the committee in response to the subpoena without approval from the @entity56 , which could come only following a review process , ' @entity23 wrote			2
@entity13 said he was disappointed at @entity0 's lack of cooperation			2
' not only was the secretary the sole arbiter of what was a public record , she also summarily decided to delete all emails from her server , ensuring no one could check behind her analysis in the public interest , ' he said			0
in a statement released later friday , @entity0 spokesman @entity142 said she ' would like her emails made public as soon as possible and ... she 's ready and willing to come and appear herself for a hearing open to the @entity36 public			0
