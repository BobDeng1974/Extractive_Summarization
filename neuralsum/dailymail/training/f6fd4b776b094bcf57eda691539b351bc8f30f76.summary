by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 04:07 est , 17 october 2013 updated : 06:18 est , 17 october 2013 a government minister grew so fed up with @entity4 ’s ‘ clunky and rubbish ’ it systems he had his own personal wi - fi network installed			1
@entity6 became frustrated at the time it took to log on to government systems and wanted to use his @entity9 instead			0
but the cabinet office minister was astonished to find that a multi-million contract signed by the @entity13 government did not include providing a easy wireless web access usually found in coffee shops			1
frustration : cabinet office @entity6 , pictured in his @entity4 office , demanded wi - fi be installed so he could use his @entity9 and bypass cumbersome government systems he now wants almost all civil servants to use ‘ off the shelf ’ computers and mobile phones to cut costs and speed up the way they work			1
the coalition has grown increasingly irritated with the way @entity4 buys and uses technology			2
a study found civil servants waste the equivalent of three days a year waiting for their computers to turn on			2
mr @entity6 was forced to take matters into his own hands when he could not get his phone or @entity9 to work in his @entity4 office			1
he refused to use a high security computer issued by contractors under the @entity13 deal because it involved entering numerous passwords and could not use it to surf the internet properly			2
farce : it systems in different departments are not compatible so officials have to dash around @entity4 carrying printouts of emails instead he had a wi - fi system installed in his office overlooking @entity51 so he can by - pass government systems and use his @entity9 to go online			1
a source close to mr @entity6 said : ‘ he got wi - fi so he can use the internet on his own machine			1
‘ when we came into government everybody in the @entity16 was using encrypted laptops which cost £ 7,000 - a - year to run			1
‘ you can buy several good machines off the shelf for that			0
this was under a contract signed by the last government			2
‘ what were @entity13 doing signing up to an it contract which did n’t include @entity68 ? ’ sensitive : a document detailing on what days different milk was bought for civil servants to make tea and coffee was marked ' restricted ' by over-zealous security officials it is understood the contract is due to expire soon and mr @entity6 is demanding it be dramatically rewritten			1
in june @entity81 , the government 's new chief operating officer , revealed his frustrations with @entity4 ’s it : ' i came into the office and i pressed my pc and it took me seven minutes to boot up			1
' that 's government in the old world , that 's three days of the year i waste of my time booting up , ' the @entity88 reported			2
' i think the average cost of a desktop [ computer ] a year is about £ 6,000			0
you could go and buy 10 @entity9 a year			0
' the changes emerged as mr @entity6 announced changes to the security classification of documents in a bid to improve communication and save millions of pounds			0
in future all documents will be either top secret , secret or official after ministers condemned the old six - tier system as a @entity110 relic			1
mr @entity6 ordered the shake - up after learning that a document detailing on what days full fat , semi-skimmed and skimmed milk was bought for civil servants to make tea and coffee was marked ' restricted ' by over-zealous security officials			1
an official was also landed in hot water for leaving a document marked ‘ restricted ’ on a printer , even though it was the only thing written on the sheet of paper			0
mr @entity6 said : ‘ @entity4 uses a security classification system designed decades ago			0
‘ we are changing that and introducing a new system fit for the digital age			0
it will speed up decisions , make it easier to share information and save hard - working taxpayers ' money			0
‘ there has been a tendency to over mark documents rather than to manage risk properly			0
‘ this can devalue the basic security principles			0
‘ we think the most important and sensitive materials should be protected as ' @entity144 ' or ' @entity144 ' but for other information the new ' @entity147 ' category , with its renewed emphasis upon personal responsibility and accountability , will be appropriate for most of what government does			0
