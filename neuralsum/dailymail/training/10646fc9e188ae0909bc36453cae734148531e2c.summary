secretary of state @entity0 said wednesday that @entity2 prime minister @entity1 might be wrong about his opposition to negotiating a deal with @entity5 over its nuclear program			1
@entity0 told the @entity7 he did n't want to comment on @entity1 's upcoming speech to @entity9 next week			1
the @entity2 leader is expected to argue that @entity11 is not negotiating in good faith and that despite its claims to the contrary , it wants to develop a nuclear weapon			1
@entity1 , he said , ' may have a judgment that just may not be correct here			1
the two men had ' injected a degree of partisanship ' that is ' destructive to the fabric of the relationship ' between @entity2 and @entity40 , @entity34 told a @entity42 audience @entity0 had his own harsh words for the @entity2 leader , noting that he had earlier slammed an interim agreement with @entity5 as the ' deal of the century ' for @entity11 , but now supports that first - step agreement that the @entity22 claims stalled @entity5 's program while talks ensued			1
members of the committee pressed @entity0 about the sensitive nuclear talks , saying @entity11 's mullahs are stonewalling international inspectors about their past work on an atomic bomb			0
@entity58 @entity57 rep. @entity57 , the committee 's chairman , told @entity0 that members of the panel have serious concerns about the direction of the talks			2
' i 'm hearing less about dismantlement and more about the performance of @entity5 's nuclear program , ' @entity57 told @entity0			1
' that 's particularly disturbing when you consider that international inspectors report that @entity5 has still not revealed its past bomb work			2
' the secretary testified in the @entity32 two days after returning to @entity73 from the latest round of talks in @entity76 involving @entity5 , the @entity22 and five other world powers			1
@entity22 and @entity5 officials reported progress on getting to a deal that would clamp down on @entity11 's nuclear activities for at least 10 years but would then slowly ease restrictions			1
@entity57 and @entity84 lawmakers are skeptical that @entity5 is negotiating in good faith and accuse @entity11 of buying time and meddling throughout the @entity88			2
still , a comprehensive pact could ease 35 years of @entity22 - @entity5 enmity , and seems within reach for the first time in more than a decade of negotiations			2
@entity57 said the @entity95 's @entity94 has expressed concerns about the scope of @entity5 military - related activities , including its work in designing a nuclear payload for a missile			2
' the @entity94 inspectors have amassed over a 1,000 pages which showed research , development and testing activity on technologies needed to develop a nuclear weapon , ' the congressman said			0
' of the 12 sets of questions that the @entity94 has been seeking since 2011 , @entity5 has answered part of one of them			0
... they are withholding that information			0
' @entity117 : @entity1 has argued for years , as he did in 2012 at the @entity95 , that @entity5 ca n't be permitted to acquire a nuclear bomb the usual suspects : ' @entity121 ' protesters tried to disrupt wednesday 's hearing when @entity0 entered , but were hauled off by @entity124 officers @entity0 agreed that @entity57 's questions were legitimate and that @entity5 must answer them if it wants to have an agreement with the @entity22 and its partners on a deal to curb its nuclear program			1
' they are legitimate and the questions have to be answered , ' @entity0 said			0
' and they will be if they want to have an agreement			0
' he said @entity5 has complied with all the provisions of a first - step agreement , which launched the talks			0
' they agreed to roll back their program , ' @entity0 said			0
' i think that 's cause for hope			0
' wednesday was @entity0 's second appearance before @entity9 in as many days			1
as he did on tuesday in the @entity146 , @entity0 told members of the @entity7 that it 's inappropriate to condemn what is in an agreement before anybody knows what it is – or even if there even will be a deal			2
' we certainly do n't think it 's appropriate to condemn it before everybody knows what it , in fact , is – if there is an " is " , ' @entity0 said			0
negotiators are rushing to try to meet a march 31 deadline for a framework agreement that would keep @entity11 from being able to develop nuclear weapons .			0

@entity22 secretary of state claims @entity2 's prime minister could be wrong about @entity5 's willingness to walk back its nuke program
@entity1 , he told @entity9 on wednesday , ' may have a judgment that just may not be correct here '
the @entity2 leader is *scheduled* to address a @entity178 next week in an appearance orchestrated behind the @entity32 's back
*congressional* *democrats* are *furious* and more than two dozen say they will *boycott* the speech
@entity25 , the @entity32 's national security adviser , said tuesday that it has ' injected a degree of partisanship ' that is ' destructive '
