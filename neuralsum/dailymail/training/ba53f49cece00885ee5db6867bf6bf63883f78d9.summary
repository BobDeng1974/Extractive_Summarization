@entity0 has asked the @entity1 to throw out former @entity4 boss @entity3 's claim for damages over ' sex orgy ' pictures as a judge admitted awarding compensation would be ' difficult ' @entity0 has asked the @entity1 to throw out former @entity4 boss @entity3 's claim for damages over ' sex orgy ' pictures as a judge admitted awarding compensation would be ' difficult '			1
@entity3 , 74 , is seeking damages from @entity0 @entity15 and parent company @entity0 , and an injunction banning the publication of the photographs on the search engine			1
he has brought a claim against @entity21 - based @entity0 and @entity0 @entity15 under the @entity22 and against @entity0 for misuse of private information			1
however , @entity0 ’s lawyers say that his case is unsustainable in fact and law and should be struck out			1
they also argue that permission to serve the claim on @entity0 outside the jurisdiction of the court should be set aside			0
the litigation follows @entity3 ’s 2008 privacy victory against the now - defunct @entity36 newspaper when he won £ 60,000 compensation after it accused him of taking part in a ' sick @entity40 orgy ' with five prostitutes			1
@entity3 , the son of the 1930s @entity43 leader sir @entity42 , did not dispute taking part in the sadomasochistic roleplay at a rented @entity47 basement flat , but said it was consensual and private , with no @entity40 overtones			2
he said that his life had been devastated by the march 2008 expose and by the newspaper putting secretly - filmed footage on its website , which attracted at least 3.5 million hits			0
today , @entity3 continued his battle against @entity0 in @entity56 ’s @entity1 , but mr @entity57 said damages ‘ may simply not be available ’ to him			1
however , the judge said some form of injunction banning the images could be ‘ much less problematic ’			1
@entity0 ’s counsel , @entity63 , said today that the threshold test was whether a person had a reasonable expectation of privacy , taking into account all the circumstances of the case			1
he said that , shortly after the expose , mr @entity79 refused @entity3 a temporary injunction against @entity81 ( @entity81 ) , saying that he no longer had any reasonable expectation of privacy and , even if he had , the ' dam has effectively burst ' and an order would be futile			1
during the damages trial , mr @entity79 ruled that the newspaper article was not in the public interest			0
@entity3 , 74 , is seeking damages from @entity0 ( pictured ) and parent company @entity0 , and an injunction banning the publication of the photographs on the search engine he said @entity3 ' had a reasonable expectation of privacy in relation to sexual activities ( albeit unconventional ) carried on between consenting adults on private property			1
' but he branded the former president of the motoring organisation the @entity103 ' reckless and almost self destructive ' and ' the author of his own misfortune			0
' after the trial , the judge did grant a permanent injunction against @entity81 , preventing re-publication , on the basis that it should not be entitled to profit from its own wrongdoing , but this did not prohibit other parties outside @entity113 and @entity114 from using images already in the public domain			2
' the images , including the 95 - second video , have now been continuously available online for over six years and have in all likelihood been viewed by millions of people around the world , ' said mr @entity123			0
“ there is no previous successful claim for misuse of private information which relates to material which has been so widely disseminated and which is so well - known			0
' if the claimant had lost his reasonable expectation of privacy back in april 2008 , within days of publication , it is clear that six years on he can not have any reasonable expectation of privacy in relation to the images			2
' today , @entity3 continued his battle against @entity0 in @entity56 ’s @entity1 , but mr @entity57 said damages ‘ may simply not be available ’ to him mr @entity123 said that , notwithstanding this , @entity0 had used its notice and takedown procedures to block images when specific urls had been provided because , whatever the strict legal position , it had some sympathy for @entity3 and wished to avoid a dispute			1
he described @entity42 , who was in court for the hearing , as someone who had remained in the public eye as ' an admirable campaigner for privacy rights '			0
@entity3 has campaigned for privacy since the article was printed , backing pressure group hacked off and giving evidence in the @entity159			2
he has also been successful in legal bids to stop @entity0 from directing users to images of the orgy via the @entity165 and @entity166 courts			2
@entity3 ( pictured ) , who was in court for the hearing , was described as ' an admirable campaigner for privacy rights ' by @entity0 's lawyer @entity123 mr @entity123 added that @entity0 , as the operator of @entity172 , was not a ' publisher ' of the images for the purposes of a privacy claim and no general obligation to monitor could be imposed on it			1
@entity3 ’s lawyers say that @entity0 ’s application is misconceived and want it dismissed with a defence filed within 28 days			1
his counsel , @entity181 , said that although @entity3 had pursued third parties who continued to publish in several jurisdictions , the image remained accessible to users of @entity172			0
@entity0 accepted that links to the images should be removed from its indices , but would only do so after @entity3 sent them the precise url for each image , which meant he was forced to engage in what a @entity194 court had described as an ' endless game of " whack - a - mole " ''			1
mr @entity198 added that this was despite the fact that , as @entity0 now accepted , it was possible for it to take technical steps to prevent the images being indexed by @entity172 in the first place			2
faced with ' this lack of co-operation ' from @entity0 , @entity3 had brought his claim in july last year			1
mr @entity198 added : ' despite its dominance of the online search market in the @entity15 , @entity0 has consistently sought to avoid appearing before the @entity113 courts to defend itself on the merits			1
' whilst accepting that it should take material down - as in the present case - it has consistently refused to use automated technical means to assist individuals			0
' the court should dismiss these applications and the defendants should be required to defend themselves at a full trial			0
' mr @entity57 said he was not bound by mr @entity79 ’s decision , since it was an interim order , adding he did not ‘ see why , even if the fact is public , the photographs should not be subject to continuing restraint ’			0
‘ if you accept as a premise that the possession alone of photographs of an intimate act is itself a breach of privacy and confidentiality , then it seems to me that you are entitled to restrain it , whether or not it is in the public domain , ' he added			0
however , the judge indicated @entity3 was unlikely to be able to win any sort of damages from @entity0			1
the judge said , ‘ that particular remedy may simply not be available to the claimant ’			0
later he said that ‘ the difficult part of mr @entity198 ’s case is that [ damages ] part of his case ’			2
but he said ordering some form of injunction appeared ‘ much less problematic ’			2
the lawyers mentioned the possibility of ‘ fingerprinting ’ pictures , which would identify them as being unfit for publication			0
mr @entity123 conceded it was possible to mark certain pictures in this way and said it was not a difficult exercise for @entity0 to undertake			0
mr @entity57 appeared to favour this solution , saying it was ‘ strongly arguable that there is a difference between something you ca n’t do anything about and something you can do something easily about ’			0
on a separate issue , mr @entity123 denied that @entity0 was a ‘ publisher ’ of material , stating search results were created by ‘ an algorithmic exercise without human knowledge or involvement ’			2
quoting an earlier judgement , he said @entity3 ’s case was ‘ impermissibly speculative ’			0
the hearing continues tomorrow when the judge is likely to reserve his decision to a later date			0
