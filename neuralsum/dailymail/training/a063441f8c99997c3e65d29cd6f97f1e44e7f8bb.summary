the shockingly disfigured man , whose full - body tumours were lovingly kissed by the @entity2 , has been revealed as a 53 - year - old @entity4 suffering from a rare genetic disease			1
@entity7 ’s entire body has been ravaged by the growths , a symptom of neorofibramatosis , which is not contagious			1
earlier this month his picture shot round the world , when he was emotionally embraced by @entity13 , at one of the pontiff ’s weekly audiences in @entity17			1
act of kindness : @entity13 ( left ) comforted @entity7 , a 52 - year - old @entity4 who had travelled to @entity17 for a audience in @entity22 in november the severely disabled man , who is shunned in the street , and has induced horror even in his doctors , has for the first time described the encounter , saying that being caressed by @entity13 was like ‘ being in @entity29 ’			1
he told @entity4 news magazine @entity30 he was left speechless when @entity2 did not hesitate to touch him			2
he said : ‘ his hands were so soft			2
and his smile was so clear and open			2
but the thing that struck me most is that there has not been thinking about whether or not to hug me			2
i 'm not contagious , but he did not know			2
but he just did it : he caressed me all over my face , and as he did i felt only love			2
he recollected the meeting of a fortnight ago : ' first i kissed his hand while he , with the other hand , caressed my head and wounds			0
then he drew me to him in a strong embrace , kissing my face			0
' my head was against his chest his arms were wrapped around me			0
it lasted just over a minute , but to me it seemed like an eternity			0
' mr @entity7 was accompanied to the @entity54 's @entity22 by his aunt , @entity55 and his younger sister @entity56 , who also suffers from a lesser form of the disease			1
the meeting with @entity13 marked a new beginning for him he said : ‘ later i turned to my aunt and told her : " here i leave my pain " '			0
touching moment : the pontiff kissed mr @entity7 , who suffers from a rare disease called neurofibromatosis , which is genetic and not contagious mr @entity7 first needed medical attention at the age of two for the genetic condition , and has since endured numerous operations on his heart , throat and eyes			1
but it was the growths , that first appeared at the age of 15 , that destroyed his appearance			1
now his entire face and head are covered in growths , @entity30 reported			1
only his left cheek , warped as if burnt in a fire is free of the painful growths			1
his feet are deformed and devastated by the sores , which makes walking difficult			0
he lives with his sister in the council house they share in a suburb of @entity93 , working part - time as handyman in a retirement home			1
their mother was afflicted by the same condition and eventually died of it			1
mr @entity7 himself was only expected to live until the age of 30			1
the severely sick man has been reviled in the street as an ‘ @entity105 ’ , with mothers crossing the street to avoid him , but those in his community have now come to love him			0
he said : ' those who i have known for a long time are kind ; the others are horrible			0
’ he is taken to @entity113 , a popular place of pilgrimage in @entity116 , every year by @entity117 , but it was the first time they had thought to take him to @entity120 ’s			0
@entity121 has long been associated with the ' @entity105 , ' the name given to @entity105 , who was severely disfigured			0
but evidence now suggests he was suffering from another rare syndrome the man who met @entity13 is believed to be suffering from a condition called neurofibromatosis – the name for a number of genetic conditions that cause swellings or lumps			1
although many people who have the condition inherit it from one of their parents , up to 50 per cent develop it randomly from a gene mutation before they are born			1
there are two types of neurofibromatosis and this man is suffering from type one , dr @entity140 , a @entity142 - based genetics expert , told @entity147			0
despite their alarming appearance , the growths and swellings - called neurofibromas and caused by a growth of cells - are not cancerous or contagious			1
the condition has long been associated with the ‘ @entity105 , ’ the name given to @entity105 , who was severely disfigured			2
however , in 1986 , a new theory emerged that mr @entity105 may actually have had @entity158 syndrome , a condition which involves symptoms such as abnormal growth of the bones , skin and head			2
the confusion was again compounded in 2001 when it was proposed that he had suffered from a combination of neurofibromatosis type one ( @entity168 ) and @entity158 syndrome			0
however , @entity170 tests on his hair and bones have proven inconclusive			0
other symptoms of neurofibromatosis type one include flat , light brown spots on the skin			0
these harmless marks , also called cafe au lait spots , are common in many people			0
people who have more than six spots that are bigger than half a centimetre wide should get investigated for @entity168			0
@entity168 is a condition someone is born with , although some symptoms develop gradually over many years			1
the severity of the condition can vary considerably from person to person			2
people with @entity190 are more likely to suffer from learning difficulties and behavioural problems , a type of cancer known as malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours , which affect around 10 per cent of people with @entity168 over their lifetime , vision problems , high blood pressure and a curved spine .			0
