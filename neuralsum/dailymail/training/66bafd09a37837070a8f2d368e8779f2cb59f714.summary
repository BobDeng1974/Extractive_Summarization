at the beginning of his sentencing hearing today , prosecutor @entity35 said the defendant had a ' longstanding , unlawful , sexual interest in boys '			1
he added : ' the defendant , through the trust he had acquired , circumvented the procedures and encourages a number of young patients to see him alone			1
' it was in these circumstance under the guise of legitimate examinations he went entirely beyond the bounds			2
' he took the opportunity of fondling the boy 's genitals and encouraging them to masturbate in his presence and obtain erections for his own personal gratification			2
' on some occasions , when he failed to exclude the parent , he simply carried on behind the curtain behind which the boy had gone to remove his clothes			2
' the offences took place over four - and - a - half years , beginning within six months of him taking up his post in 2008 and continuing to the day he was suspended when the first concerns were raised			1
at some point , he began using a camera pen in an attempt to gain images of the boys when partially clothed , mr @entity35 added			1
police found 170,425 images on this pen but none of these were classed as indecent			2
mr @entity35 explained @entity0 was first arrested in december 2013 after police were alerted by @entity82 authorities that he had bought a dvd containing indecent images of children as part of @entity87			1
at that point @entity88 were already investigating after concerns were raised about his conduct			2
mr @entity35 said the offences were a ' grave breach of trust ' which had undermined the trust of patients			2
' this defendant was a complete maverick and his behaviour is the antithesis of his profession - he has betrayed his profession , ' he added			1

@entity0 , who , the court heard , was also involved in church and @entity125 groups , was described as ' a man of great charm and persuasiveness ' whom everybody trusted			2
when one victim raised concerns with his mother , she responded : ' he 's a doctor , it must be necessary			2
' brazen : outlining details of some of @entity0 's victims , the prosecutor said the familiar routine involved isolating them from their parents , asking them to remove their clothes and then groping their genitals mr @entity35 said : ' that was the very image that really protected him from anything other than the most persistent line of complaint			2
' outlining details of some of @entity0 's victims , the prosecutor said the familiar routine involved isolating them from their parents , asking them to remove their clothes and then groping their genitals			0
the depth of the examinations were often increased to meet @entity0 's sexual needs , not any medical requirement , he added			1
one victim , who can not be named for legal reasons , said in a statement read to the court : ' i am now anxious to go to the doctor because i do n't know who i should trust			0
' i have haemophilia and a pain in my side so i know i should go but i feel disgusted and weird			1
' i did n't think it would happen to me and i feel angry every time i think about it but also relieved it was n't just me but we should n't have to go through it			0
' another said he had regular nightmares , felt stressed and lacked confidence			0
' i 'd like to see @entity0 and ask him why he did what he did to me , ' he added			0
@entity0 looked anxious as he sat in the dock wearing a dark suit and blue tie			0
in mitigation , ms @entity119 said @entity0 's guilty pleas had spared his victims the ordeal of giving evidence in court			0
she added : ' clearly on a human level something has gone very badly wrong in this man 's life and thought processes			0
' she said @entity0 seemed to have repressed homosexual feelings during puberty and this influenced his behaviour			0
ms @entity119 added that he accepted what he did was ' repugnant '			0
' he knows he will not get any understanding or forgiveness because what he did was unforgivable , ' she said			0
' his medical life may have done some good at some time but that means nothing now			0
' he accepts that that was the life which allowed him to commit those offences			0
' mistakes by the @entity206 ( @entity206 ) meant @entity0 was left free for 16 months to wage his campaign of abuse			0
the doctor bought a dvd in 2005 from @entity87 in @entity82			0
the company advertised on its website ' just legal ' and ' naturist ' films but many were clearly illegal - and were bought by paedophiles in over 50 countries around the world			1
the site was finally closed down by @entity221 police in the summer of 2012 and concerned officers in @entity82 soon dispatched the names of its customers to authorities in other countries in an operation called @entity229			0
@entity206 was handed a list of 2,235 suspected @entity232 paedophiles in july 2012 by @entity82 police - but did nothing for months			1
@entity82 police told @entity232 authorities about suspected paedophiles including @entity0 as part of a worldwide operation called @entity229 it was only when the centre was absorbed by the @entity241 last november that @entity0 's name was passed to @entity29 police and his home was raided			0
in the intervening time he had continued his abuse and made his trip to the @entity104 orphanage			0
among the other suspects named on the list handed over by @entity82 authorities was that of teacher @entity252 , who was found dead a day after police first contacted him			0
following the 46 - year - old 's death , a search of his house in @entity257 , @entity254 was conducted and 7,257 indecent images of children that he had downloaded from the internet were found			1
