@entity0 has told his mandatory challenger @entity1 that he must ' prove himself ' before he is given a shot at his @entity5 super-middleweight title			1
since being knocked out by @entity6 at @entity7 in may , @entity1 has responded with back - to - back victories , the first of which made him the @entity11 in the @entity5 's 168lb rankings			1
in a @entity14 exclusive in september , @entity0 described @entity1 as a ' fraud ' who did not deserve a crack at his title			1
@entity0 ( right ) may sidestep @entity1 and make a voluntary defence of his title @entity20 has since won twice , outpointing @entity21 to claim the @entity23 title before knocking out @entity24 in november			1
but , despite those victories , @entity0 's attitude has not changed and he insists he will not be agreeing to a fight with the @entity28			1
when asked about @entity29 , @entity0 said : ' who ? i do n't know that guy			1
' oh that guy who fought @entity6 and got knocked out by him twice ? oh that guy			2
' there 's no interest			2
why would there be ? he got knocked out twice			2
dirrell wiith @entity41 's daughter @entity40 at @entity5 convention in @entity43 on monday ' why would you get a shot if you got knocked out twice ? he 's a good fighter but you got knocked out twice			2
' you need to prove yourself			2
you have n't fought anybody yet to prove yourself and won			2
' he still has to prove himself			2
you have to fight , that 's how you prove yourself			0
' he got knocked out twice			0
who deserves a shot after that ? that 's like me saying , if he had the championship and i got knocked out twice by @entity6 , they would n't want to see me fight the champion			0
' vice versa it 's the same thing			0
' @entity1 ' promoters , @entity63 , have attempted to make contact with @entity0 's representatives to get the ball rolling on their mandatory challenge			1
@entity1 is no 1 contender for @entity5 super-middleweight title after back - to - back victories it is unclear whether the @entity72 are considering their options but @entity0 seems relaxed about the possibility of being stripped of his belt , should he fail to meet his mandatory requirements			1
@entity1 and his promoters are in @entity43 this week for the @entity5 convention and are expected to force the issue with the governing body about their plans for the super-middleweight strap			1
but @entity0 will be allowed to make a voluntary defence of his title as late as march before being forced to turn his attention to @entity1			1
@entity0 , the self - styled ' dog ' added : ' we 're looking to make money , that 's what this business is about			1
i got the belt , i got what i came here for and now it 's time to get paid			0
' me and my management team need to go and see who we want to fight but not yet			0
we should have one soon and that 's what i 'm waiting on			0
' @entity0 has dismissed @entity29 as a ' fraud ' after being knocked out twice by @entity6 when asked whether he would consider facing @entity1 in the @entity102 , considering how much money @entity20 generated in ticket sales in 2014 , @entity0 replied : ' never			1
why have i got to go over there to fight him if we have to fight ? he has to come and see me			0
that 's just how it is			0
i 'm not going to go over there just because			0
that 's not how it works			0
' @entity113 [ @entity112 ] never went anywhere and he 's selling out arenas			0
you 've got to come to the @entity72 to fight , to get your name known , before you can you 're somebody			1
' @entity118 has revealed that @entity1 could be in line to fight for the vacant @entity121 title , should @entity6 vacate it , in an all - @entity102 grudge match with @entity124 , meaning the mandatory shot at @entity0 could be put on the back - burner			1
on @entity127 added : ' he 's a good fighter , he 's an olympian i heard			0
he 's a good fighter also			0

@entity0 considering options for his first title defence
@entity1 is no 1 contender after back - to - back victories
the @entity72 may ignore @entity29 and make voluntary defence
