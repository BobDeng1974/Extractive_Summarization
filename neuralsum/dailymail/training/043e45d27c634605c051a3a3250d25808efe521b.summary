on the mean streets of @entity3 's @entity2 a young man has two choices : make something of your life or ... well , the other option is n't worth thinking about			1
an area renowned for gang warfare , drugs and crime , it has undergone a revamp in recent years but there is no escaping you need to be hewn from stern stuff to survive			2
@entity18 took the first option yet recognises the role @entity21 played in shaping the man he is today			1
@entity22 midfielder @entity18 , now playing for @entity23 , is grateful for his chance in football ' where i grew up it was a rough area but it 's something i would never change , ' says the @entity23 midfielder			1
' it made me what i am			0
every day was an education			0
' @entity18 was one of many football - daft kids who played the game on the streets or on the red ash pitches in the shadow of @entity40 's old training ground			1
they took on other streets , against boys and men of all shapes and pedigree			0
' we had 22 kids or whoever playing against each other on whatever pitch we could find			0
it 's not something you see too much of now and i think kids today are missing out			2
it was where we all came together and it taught me a lot			0
it toughened me up and made me sharper			0
' the 27 - year - old , seen training , is adamant the current @entity22 squad is good enough to qualify for @entity65 @entity18 was a second - half substitute in the 1 - 0 win over @entity67 on saturday but hopes to start in @entity68 temptation of a different life was never far away though			1
his friends boasted of great nights out drinking at 15 and 16 while @entity18 confesses he once got involved in a gangfight but fear of his father 's reaction meant once was more than enough			1
' my mum and dad always kept at me about keeping to the right path and not getting involved			0
my dad @entity81 drove me up and down the country so that i could play my football and it 's one thing i never forgot			1
' as soon as i was able to help my family i did			0
' however @entity21 is painted , it certainly provided motivation ; @entity18 's boyhood friends @entity88 and @entity90 also went on to make professional careers and the values learned on their housing estate remain			1
the @entity96 , evading @entity94 of @entity95 , has impressed since joining @entity23 this summer @entity18 was a late substitute in @entity22 's win over @entity67 on saturday and is keen to play a greater role against @entity68 on tuesday night			1
he wo n't be rushing to swap shirts with @entity100 though			2
@entity18 was one of @entity22 's star turns in their bold performance against @entity103 last month but defeat meant the 27 - year - old was n't in the mood for mementoes from any of their @entity109 winners			1
' i did n't go looking to swap shirts with anyone , ' he says			2
' you see it all the time now but what message does that send out to the fans ? we lost the game			2
' if i was a fan i would n't be happy seeing players running to swap shirts with a team they 'd lost to			1
you want to play against those players , the best in the world , but i was more bothered by our result			2
it was a good performance but we were upset not to get something from it			0
i do n't want a shirt to remind me of defeat			0
' @entity22 manager @entity131 talks his players through his instructions in training as @entity18 looks on @entity131 will hope @entity18 and the rest of the squad can perform heroically in @entity68 on tuesday @entity18 , who names former @entity138 and @entity22 captain @entity139 as one of his boyhood heroes , is confident @entity22 can progress from what is a tricky group			1
' we have a good group of players and we firmly believe we can qualify if we play to our potential			1
' progress could be at the expense of his close friend @entity150 the @entity152 and @entity154 midfielder who played alongside @entity18 at @entity156 before both moved to @entity158 where they won the @entity159 but also got relegated ; ' the highest and lowest points of my career and within a week of each other '			1
the two were often confused by commentators due to the similarities in their name and the matter was compounded when singer @entity169 won the tv show @entity170			0
' i think my twitter following multiplied until they realised their mistake , ' he jokes			0
@entity175 's strike led to the winning goal in @entity22 's 1 - 0 defeat of @entity67 at @entity178 on saturday @entity22 moved above @entity103 on goal difference after the world champions were beaten by @entity68 @entity18 and @entity150 faced each other as opponents for the first time shortly after @entity18 's Â£ 7m summer transfer and it was @entity23 who came out victorious			1
' we exchanged a few texts in the build - up , a few jokes , all good natured banter , but during the game i did n't get the chance to say anything as he ended up playing right - back			2
he 's a terrific player though			2
' he moans a lot but he 's taking his game to another level now and he 's going to be one of the best in the @entity200			2
' @entity18 's transfer to @entity23 was n't the only major change in his life last summer			1
resplendent in kilt , he married long - time girlfriend @entity205 , mother of their baby daughter @entity206 , at the luxurious @entity209 hotel on @entity210			2
@entity68 striker @entity211 ( r ) celebrates with team - mate @entity212 after scoring against @entity103 the family , complete with pet puggle dog @entity214 , a pug and beagle cross before you ask , moved to @entity219 in august and are already settled			1
' i was sad to leave @entity158 because there were so many good people there			0
@entity224 came close to signing me too but @entity23 agreed the terms and i knew it was the best move for my career and my family			2
' we 've adjusted pretty well already			0
we were in a hotel for a few days but we quickly got a house and that 's made a huge difference			0
' @entity68 ( probable , 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity234 ; @entity235 , @entity236 , @entity237 , @entity238 ; @entity239 , @entity240 , @entity241 , @entity212 ; @entity211 , @entity100			1
@entity22 ( probable , 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity242 ; @entity243 , @entity244 , @entity245 , @entity246 ; @entity247 , @entity248 ; @entity249 , @entity250 , @entity175 ; @entity251			1
referee : @entity253 ( @entity254 )			0
@entity255 : live on @entity256 1 from 7.30pm and @entity257 from 7.45pm			0
any upheaval has been helped by the presence of friend and fellow golf buff @entity261 while manager @entity263 has been quick to make him feel at home			0
' he 's a character , ' says @entity18			1
' i 'm grateful to him for bringing me back to the @entity200 and he 's been excellent with me			0
he 's obviously a passionate guy , you can see that on the touchline but he 's always got a smile			0
' he 's very organised as a manager and he 's always chirpy around the place , cracking jokes			0
he wants his team to win but i 've not seen him going over the top , not yet anyway			0
' it seems the young @entity18 from @entity2 has made all the right choices .			1
