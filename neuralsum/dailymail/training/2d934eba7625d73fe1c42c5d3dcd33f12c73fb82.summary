the @entity0 dropped below 75p this morning as markets reacted to the election victory of an anti-austerity party in @entity4			1
@entity5 warned @entity7 's economic stability depends on a strong eurozone as the future of the single currency was plunged into crisis			1
the chancellor urged @entity4 's new leaders to act ' responsibly ' after @entity14 triumphed , warning that the institutions of the eurozone are ' not working well enough ' , which has an impact on the @entity7			1
the result puts @entity4 on a collision course with finance ministers across the @entity20 , after @entity14 vowed to reopen @entity4 's vast bailout deal			1
at 5pm , one euro was worth 74.82p , after falling to an 14 - year low against the dollar overnight			1
the euro has been falling in value against the pound and the dollar for more than a year , and there are fears about the impact of @entity14 's election victory in @entity4 on the stability of the eurozone the euro , already hammered by the stimulus package , sunk to a 14 - year low against the @entity37 dollar overnight before pulling back some of the losses			1
the pound rose to a new near - seven - year high of 1.35 against the single currency though , again , this was pared back later			2
but @entity7 and @entity43 stock markets appeared to shrug off the result , which many analysts had predicted			1
the @entity46 finished in positive territory - ending up 19.57 points			2
@entity50 and @entity51 markets also posted gains , suggesting the markets had already ' priced in ' a @entity14 victory			2
@entity55 's @entity14 won the poll , but fell just short of an overall majority			2
he has pledged to renegotiate @entity4 's 240 billion euro ( £ 179 billion ) international bailout deal , and reverse many of the reforms that creditors demanded in exchange for keeping @entity4 financially afloat since 2010			1
the result threatens the continued membership of @entity4 in the 19 - bloc currency			2
the @entity46 opened down by just under 0.5 per cent lower			0
mr @entity5 , who is on a visit to @entity66 , said relying on spending more money to get out of difficulties was a ' panacea , false hope '			0
' ultimately , if you take at face value all the things that the new @entity4 government has promised , including new big increases in public expenditure , i think that is going to be very difficult to deliver and incompatible with what the eurozone currently demands of its members , ' he said			0
' but i hope that both sides now act responsibly			2
' everyone has in the past looked over the precipice of @entity4 exit from the euro and pulled back			0
it is certainly in the @entity7 's interest that we have stability , that we have proper dialogue here between members of the euro			2
' but ultimately what the @entity7 needs is a strong partner , and the institutions of the eurozone are not working well enough for the people of @entity43 , and that has an impact on us			1
' @entity7 chancellor @entity5 , pictured today on a visit to @entity105 in @entity106 , urged all sides in @entity4 to ' now act responsibly ' to prevent a new financial crisis in a message on @entity111 last night , @entity109 also cautioned over the effects of the crisis			1
' the @entity4 election will increase economic uncertainty across @entity43			1
that 's why the @entity7 must stick to our plan , delivering security at home , ' he wrote			0
@entity122 , a @entity14 mp tipped to become @entity4 's next finance minister , told @entity125 that the country 's austerity programme had been like ' waterboarding '			1
but he insisted that a @entity4 exit from the euro was not ' on the cards ' and the party would not take a ' confrontational ' approach			0
' there has been a bit of posturing on our side			0
what really matters now is that we sit down and discuss a way that the haircut to our debt - the debt writedown - is minimised , ' he said			0
' @entity145 is not on the cards , we are not going to @entity147 or @entity148 and @entity149 in a confrontational style ... ' to have this debt schedule , debt repayment schedule as we do at the moment , which is completely unrealistic and utterly disconnected from @entity4 growth , that is not good for them , it is not good for us			2
what we want to do is bind our repayments to our growth			0
' a triumphant @entity55 told @entity4 that his radical left party 's win meant an end to ' austerity and destruction ' supporters crowded the streets of @entity168 to hear mr @entity55 speak outside the city 's @entity169 the @entity171 has backed @entity14 's anti-austerity victory and pinned its hopes on a left - wing uprising in the @entity7			1
green mp @entity175 said she had been ' inspired ' by the ' huge vote ' for @entity14			0
' now @entity20 must listen to people & economists & respond with debt forgivenesss & support , ' she wrote on @entity111			0
@entity181 and @entity182 also called for an anti-austerity revolution in @entity7			0
' greens share the view of the new government that austerity is a failed model which has piled misery on the poorest while making the wealthiest even richer , ' they said in a statement			0
they added : ' this result shows that challenging business as usual politics can win the support of the people			0
' in the @entity7 we are witnessing a @entity199 , in no small part due to our anti-austerity agenda , and we hope the @entity4 election result marks the beginnings of ordinary people standing up to a discredited economic model and failing governments across @entity43			1
' @entity208 chief analyst @entity207 said : ' it 's events in @entity43 that are at the epicentre of the markets focus once again , and the victory of the anti-austerity party @entity14 in the latest @entity4 elections , and the ramifications of which could well ripple out across @entity43 through the rest of this year , as elections loom in @entity220 , @entity221 as well as @entity222			1
' the election result comes after the @entity224 last week set out a 1.1 trillion euro ( £ 820 million ) asset purchase programme , an event which has already weakened the euro			0
last month , inflation in the eurozone turned negative for the first time since 2009 , partly due to the recent sharp fall in oil prices			0
@entity234 chief market strategist @entity233 added : ' if the trend through @entity43 is to reject austerity , reduce the shackles of debt and look for more pro-growth measures , then @entity4 has set a strong precedent and parties like the newly - formed podemos in @entity221 will be keen to see if this trend can spill over as they approach national elections later in the year			1
' a triumphant mr @entity55 told @entity4 that his radical left party 's win meant an end to ' austerity and destruction '			1
' the @entity4 people have made history			0
@entity253 has made history , ' mr @entity55 said in his victory speech at a conference hall in central @entity168			0
mr @entity55 said his party 's victory had made the ' troika a thing of the past ' , referring to the three international institutions - the @entity20 , @entity260 and @entity224 - that have carried out inspections to monitor @entity4 's progress before approving each instalment of bailout funds			1
' the verdict of the @entity4 people ends , beyond any doubt , the vicious circle of austerity in our country , ' mr @entity55 said			0
' the verdict of the @entity4 people , your verdict , annuls today in an indisputable fashion the bailout agreements of austerity and disaster			2
' the verdict of the @entity4 people renders the troika a thing of the past for our common @entity43 framework			2
' the result in @entity4 is being watched closely by financial markets around the world , including @entity285 ( pictured ) it is expected mr @entity55 will meet the leader of the small @entity289 party later today ' to confirm the support and possible participation of the @entity289 in the new government , ' according to a @entity14 official			1
@entity295 leader @entity294 said : ' this is a desperate cry for help from the @entity4 people , millions of whom have been impoverished by the euro experiment			0
' an extraordinary game of poker will now begin with chancellor @entity302 , with the @entity224 powerless to do much than be an observer			0
' @entity305 's former @entity43 minister @entity304 compared the measures imposed on the @entity4 to the restrictions placed upon @entity51 after the @entity308			2
on @entity111 he said : ' @entity14 win : austerity does not work for @entity4 , for @entity311 / @entity310 @entity7 , nor for @entity20 ; we all need investment in growth not savage cuts			1
