a man who launched an online campaign to help him destroy his brand new $ 49,000 @entity0 will read out a ' not sorry ' apology to the company on national television tonight			1
in june last year , @entity7 raised $ 18,000 online so he and 300 people could destroy his car after @entity0 refused to pay a full refund for the car or replace the vehicle which he claimed had suffered 21 separate mechanical problems			1
during a failed settlement between the manufacturer , @entity14 , and mr @entity7 , one of the requests made by the car company was for the disgruntled buyer to publish an ' apology ' in a national publication			1
however , because no one would publish the apology , he will instead read it out on the @entity25 's ' @entity24 ' tonight			2
' @entity0 , i 'm sorry			0
i 'm sorry my jeep broke down before it even left the dealership			0
' i 'm sorry it had 21 problems			0
i 'm sorry it had to be towed four times			0
i 'm sorry i was n't more grateful for your offer of a new battery			0
' i 'm sorry you would n't offer me a replacement or refund			0
but most of all , i 'm sorry i bought a jeep			0
' mr @entity7 launched a @entity53 campaign last year in an effort to raise $ 22,500 - the amount @entity56 offered him to buyback the car - and allow donors the chance to be involved in the car 's destruction			1
he is now campaigning for the @entity63 's lemon laws to be introduced in @entity64			2
pictured : ' lemon car ' drivers protest against vehicle companies who refuse to refund or replace their cars mr @entity7 's extreme measures came after years of frustration with his ' cursed ' @entity72 , which in the four years since he bought it in 2010 , had numerous problems the extreme measures came after years of frustration with his ' cursed ' @entity72 , which in the four years since he bought it in 2010 , had numerous problems including the fuel line falling off , coolant leaks , the rear strut leaking oil , ongoing ignition failure , and the turbo inlet manifold cracking			1
he claims years of campaigning the car manufacturer to refund or replace his car , which he bought from a @entity87 dealer in @entity88 had proved fruitless			2
despite successfully destroying his vehicle , mr @entity7 - who could not afford to challenge the international car company in court - has refused to back down			1
along with a number of consumer led organsiations mr @entity7 is campaigning for the @entity97 ' @entity96 to be introduced in @entity64			1
these included the fuel line falling off , coolant leaks , the rear strut leaking oil , ongoing ignition failure , and the turbo inlet manifold cracking he said that @entity112 ' that if there 's three major issues with car or a number of minor issues or one safety issues then it needs to be replaced or refunded with no questions asked ' ' @entity113 is the old term which was used to mean a really bad car			0
in the @entity63 they have had the @entity96 's in place for about 35 years , we do n't have it , ' mr @entity7 told @entity119			1
' they differ from state to state but in @entity122 , where they have the most strict version , is states that if there 's three major issues with car or a number of minor issues or one safety issues then it needs to be replaced or refunded with no questions asked			0
' it 's a lot clearer than @entity64 consumer laws which just says that the product should be fit for purpose and the dealer should do the right thing			2
' i 'm not done yet			0
i want to keep the pressure up until the government sits up and takes some responsibility and reviews this law			0
' consumer laws have somewhat improved since mr @entity7 's story came to the public 's attention , by including a notion of ' major failure '			2
however , they still remain unclear about a car owner 's rights when their vehicle has a number of smaller problems like mr @entity7 's			1
after mr @entity7 's car was destroyed , a fire was lit to bring the rubble to nothing but scrap metal along with @entity96 for @entity64 and @entity162 in @entity64 , mr @entity7 has launched several petitions and staged a number of events campaigning for more specific laws that address the holes in the legislation			1
they have sent out @entity96 stickers to hundreds of @entity64 with ' lemon cars ' in order to ' put pressure on the government and show that the movement is gaining momentum '			2
a spokesperson for @entity0 told @entity119 ' we never comment on individual cases except to say we have and always will treat mr @entity7 in a fair and professional manner '			1
mr @entity182 car was destroyed over four hours with the help of 300 people who wielded bats and sledgehammers and shot bow and arrows at it at a demolition derby last year			0
more than 300 people turned out to either witness the public smashing or to take part in it a spokesperson for @entity0 told @entity119 ' we never comment on individual cases except to say we have and always will treat mr @entity7 in a fair and professional manner ' ' the car was spinning in the air with the auger through the top of the roof , ' mr @entity7 said			1
' the whole car lifted two , maybe three foot off the ground before we crushed it and lit on fire			0
' he said the ' @entity207 ' was putting a flame to it and watching it burn before burying the scrap heap and laying flowers at the head of its makeshift burial plot			0
' the serious side to it is that i should n't have had to destroy a $ 50,000 car , ' he said			2
' if the law was there today and if @entity56 respected and looked after its customers then it would n't have had to happen			0
' @entity56 offered mr @entity7 a settlement of $ 22,500 for the car , for which he originally paid $ 49,000			1
despite knowing he could make $ 28,000 by selling it himself , he said felt uncomfortable with the option			0
