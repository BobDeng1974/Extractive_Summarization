by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 has admitted that he would have been ' lost ' had he failed to make the grade in @entity4			1
the @entity5 was recently named the world 's most marketable athlete , beating sprint sensation @entity8 and footballing superstars @entity9 and @entity11 to the title , with an estimated worth of £ 68million			1
it is far removed from @entity2 's humble beginnings in a one - bed flat in @entity16 as his father @entity17 held down three jobs in order for them to go racing			1
' i actually wrote a song about it			0
i could have been anywhere			0
i think about it today , and i am sure i would have been lost			1
' @entity2 trails @entity26 by 29 points in the race for the championship after finishing second to his @entity49 team - mate in @entity28 eight days ago			1
but the former @entity51 driver was in a reflective mood as he spoke ahead of this week 's @entity53 @entity23 ; a race he has failed to win since his remarkable drive in appalling conditions back in 2008			2
' karting was a catalyst for lots of different things , ' @entity2 added			1
' my dad was working for @entity62 and when we started karting he was doing it			2
he would pull 24 - hour shifts , just to keep us racing			1
' my dad said in the first year of racing we spent £ 20,000			2
we had just moved out of the one - bedroom flat in @entity16			0
memories : @entity2 with his dad @entity17 in 2008 , who made a lot of sacrifices for the @entity73 driver ' he put in my step mum ’s life savings , his life savings and remortgaged the house , just for that year			1
it was a huge gamble and a huge commitment , and a lot of people do that and do n’t get the end result			0
' with 35 pole positions , 26 race wins , and his championship triumph in 2008 , @entity2 can lay claim to being one of @entity53 's most successful ever drivers			1
but how would he cope if he fails to claim his second title this year given the advantage that @entity49 have over their rivals ? ' that ’s not really something i want to think about or put out there , ' he said			0
' why would i even consider it ? it ’s all about positive energy			0
' you ’ve got to have in your mind i ’m going to win			0
i ’m going to do everything that i can			0
i ’m going to get up and i ’m going to train and get to that race next week and be @entity105 , @entity105 , @entity105			0
you ca n’t ever think what if this or that , because you ’ll never get anywhere			0
' thinking : @entity2 says he will have plenty of ' positive energy ' when he takes to the track next			2

@entity2 struggles to think where he would be without @entity4
' i could have been anywhere . i think about it today , and i am sure i would have been lost , ' he says
@entity2 recently named world 's most marketable athlete , beating @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity11
@entity2 's dad @entity17 would put in 24 - hour shifts and life savings to help
