teenagers taking @entity2 science will no longer have their practical work assessed through coursework , it was confirmed yesterday			1
the exams regulator @entity7 is pressing ahead with the reform despite fierce opposition from many in the science community			1
universities have argued that that those entering undergraduate courses needed tried and tested basic skills to study at a higher level			0
@entity2 science students will no longer have practical work assessed through coursework			1
pictured , @entity20 and education secretary @entity21 watch a science experiment at a school earlier this month education @entity21 has also publicly criticised the move , recently saying it was ‘ in danger of holding back the next generation of scientists			1
’ but @entity7 has insisted that the change will ‘ liberate ’ teachers from repetitive practicals and offer more variety to pupils			2
under the proposals , there will be no separate exam specifically covering the lab work students have done , but instead there will be written exam questions that will draw on what students have learnt			0
this will count for at least 15 per cent of the total marks available			0
each exam board offering science gcses will have to specify a minimum number of practical experiments a pupil must take part in and this number will be no less than eight in each individual science and 16 for combined science courses			0
the move means that practical science will no longer be assessed through ‘ controlled assessment ’ - a type of coursework completed in the classroom			1
education @entity21 has criticised the move , saying it was ‘ in danger of holding back the next generation of scientists ’ schools will also have to confirm that students have completed a range of experiments and each pupil will have to keep a record of their work			1
@entity7 chief @entity73 said : ‘ there is unanimous agreement among scientists that practical work is central to good science qualifications			1
‘ we have consulted widely and have identified a new approach to the assessment of practical science that will liberate teachers to offer a wider variety of classroom experimentation and promote effective student progression to further study or employment			0
’ a document on the plans says that students who do not do practical work will still be able to achieve science gcses , but insists that these young people ‘ are likely to find it challenging to achieve the highest grades without having the relevant practical experience ’			1
confirmation of the changes comes in the wake of strong opposition to a similar overhaul of a-level science			0
@entity21 ’s criticism will be the first major test of @entity7 ’s independence after it was set up in 2010 as a non-ministerial government department			2
mrs @entity106 said in a letter to @entity7 yesterday that while she appreciated the ‘ reasoning ’ , she still harboured reservations			2
she wrote : ‘ i continue to share the concerns of many in the science community that not having an assessment of practicals as part of the gcse risks undermining the teaching of practicals in schools			0
‘ it is important you take all possible steps to mitigate that risk			0
’ she called for the situation to be monitored to ensure that pupils are still undertaking a range of practical activities			2
she added : ‘ i would also expect – as i am sure you are planning – arrangements to be put in place to evaluate the impact of the approach when it is implemented in schools : with a commitment to revisit the decision if the evidence shows the approach to have had a detrimental effect			0
