@entity1 manager @entity0 has reminded @entity2 and @entity3 about their professional responsibilities and urged them to learn from a chastening week			1
@entity2 , the @entity7 international who will lead @entity1 ’s line at @entity10 on sunday in the absence of the injured @entity12 , was exposed for inhaling the legal high nitrous oxide on monday			1
then 24 hours later pictures emerged of @entity2 and @entity3 with shisha pipes			1
@entity2 ( right ) was pictured smoking a shisha pipe with team - mate @entity3 earlier this season @entity1 boss @entity0 ( left ) has n't disciplined @entity2 ( pictured ) or @entity3 for the incident @entity3 was present among the @entity19 squad during their training session on friday ahead of their @entity23 semi @entity0 , who has @entity24 available for the @entity23 semi-final with @entity26 , spoke to @entity2 and @entity3 in his office on thursday but neither will be disciplined and @entity0 now wants to draw a line under the matter			1
he said : ‘ it is understanding that when you are a professional , elite sportsperson , there are things you can and can not be doing and be seen to be doing			2
‘ it ’s not just for your welfare but also because of your responsibilities			0
some of these young guys are doing what you would consider to be normal things — and i ’m not talking about this instance — ( but ) how it gets framed is totally different			0
’ @entity0 would not discuss whether he would give @entity24 , available after a three - match suspension , an immediate recall against @entity26 , making it clear that his sole priority is steering @entity1 into their first @entity23 final of his reign			1
they fell short in the title race last season and then faltered in the last four of the @entity55 in january , but @entity0 thinks they are ready to progress			2

‘ trace back the winners in sport			0
if you look at everything they have won , also look at what they have lost			0
you will see that they go close on a number of occasions before they step on			0
‘ look at players who have won champions @entity77 and you trace back and see they have also lost @entity80 semi-finals and finals			0
it ’s all part of the journey — losing but taking that forward and improving you			0
