@entity1 boss @entity0 insists his team ca n't rely on @entity3 crumbling in the @entity5 title race			1
the @entity1 could move four points clear of the reigning champions with an eighth straight victory when they take on @entity9 in @entity10 on saturday afternoon			1
yet @entity0 has told his players that they should n't be looking to @entity13 's men showing any signs of strain			1
@entity1 boss @entity0 is targeting his eighth straight victory as the @entity1 face @entity9 on saturday ' i do n't think @entity3 see it as pressure , ' he said			1
' that 's just part and parcel of being @entity3			0
they are expected to win things			2
' @entity1 's run of league wins , built in part on a sequence of seven clean sheets , needs to be extended just 90 minutes further to equal the series of victories achieved back in season 1988 - 89			1
@entity0 , recognising the importance of continuing to get results while his team are in flying form , admitted : ' from our point of view , i think nobody expected us to win seven games in a row			1
@entity13 's @entity3 are hot on the heels of @entity1 in the race for the @entity5 title ' i get that , because we 've not done that very often in our history			2
we 've won that â€“ and that has allowed us to get where we are			0
for that to continue is a big , big ask			0
but it 's something we 'll be striving to achieve			0
' the next challenge is to win eight in a row			2
if we continue to win games , then we will be satisfied that we 're improving as a team			0
i do see the improvement in us from last season and that 's all i was looking for at the start of the season , regardless of where we finish in the league			0
' i do believe that , while we 've got this bit of momentum , it 's important to try to channel it properly			0
