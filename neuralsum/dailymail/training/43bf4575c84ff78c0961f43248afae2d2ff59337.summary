as beautiful as it is here in @entity2 , the startling contrast between @entity4 and @entity5 would not have been lost on @entity6			1
the @entity7 that collected him from the airport and delivered him to the club ’s picturesque @entity11 training ground might not have been much of a culture shock			0
but the training ground car park was populated predominantly by @entity7 , too , suggesting the wage bill is inferior to the average @entity17 club , never mind @entity4			1
indeed he appears so keen to embrace what this modest football club represents he has decided to select his coaching assistants from staff already at the club after the invitation he extended to @entity36 to join him was declined			0
it says something for the confidence @entity6 has in his own ability that he arrived here alone on wednesday and will remain that way until he builds up more of a rapport with @entity43 and @entity44			1
@entity45 has been promoted from @entity5 ’s b team to become @entity6 ’ deputy ; a move that will be popular among players and supporters given that the 43 - year - old is a @entity52 who spent seven years as a player at the club			1
@entity44 will be his @entity56 to @entity57 ; a young coach from the club ’s successful academy who has a good command of @entity62			2
that is something @entity6 will need until he learns @entity18			1
the @entity65 was all smiles as he strode round the training ground in @entity2 @entity6 was soon pictured on the phone as he started his new adventure in @entity18 the former @entity4 boss arrives at the @entity11 training ground ( left ) and looks at one of his players @entity6 did say hello in @entity52 - ‘ @entity74 ’ - to the assembled media before meeting his new employers and watching @entity45 put his new players through their paces on the training pitch			1
his choice of deputies would suggest @entity6 is taking a slightly different approach from the one he employed at @entity83 , even if it was unfair to suggest he dispensed with all of sir @entity85 ’s staff there			2
he did , after all , ask @entity87 to become assistant manager			0
here in @entity2 they are far more interested in what @entity6 achieved at @entity91 than the difficult 10 months he endured at @entity4			1
@entity5 captain @entity92 ( left ) hopes @entity6 can recreate his success with @entity91 at the club they see themselves as the @entity91 of @entity97 ; a club with aspirations to compete regularly in @entity99 without breaking the bank			1
@entity92 , the @entity5 captain and a one - club man , is thrilled that @entity6 has taken the job			1
‘ he has a very big reputation in the game and all the players want him to do the same for us here as he did with @entity91 , ’ he said			2
‘ i am excited about what he can bring to the team			0
he is a big name and i think it is a big thing for the players here to have him			0
’ @entity5 were looking for a new manager after @entity115 was relieved of his duties @entity117 , the @entity5 correspondent for the city newspaper @entity119 , was similarly enthusiastic			2
‘ people expect him to give character to the team , ’ he said			0
‘ the last coach was shy , a former teacher who was n’t really known			0
he did n’t express himself so much to the players			0
‘ the fans worried that there was not so much aggression in the team			0
that is what they expect from @entity6 , coming from @entity62 and the @entity17			2
they want him to give the team some fight because there are good players , capable of finishing in the top six			0
’ on monday that same local newspaper claimed former @entity138 manager @entity137 was offered the job only hours before @entity6 , then contacted the club president - after eight days of considering the offer - to say he would come			1
@entity6 will stand in the dugout at the impressive @entity144 in @entity2 where @entity5 play @entity137 might have been used to apply some pressure when club president @entity147 always wanted @entity6			1
but it is also interesting to read claims here that @entity6 agreed to an 18 - month contract after initially being offered four years			1
@entity147 is just happy to have his man			0
‘ in @entity6 we have a manager with a big name in football with a great reputation , ’ he said			2
‘ it brings a real international coach to @entity5			0
it is great news for the players and i believe he is someone who can have us back in @entity164 football			0
’ an international name @entity6 might be , but on this occasion he has chosen to call more on local expertise			0
former @entity138 manager @entity137 was also in the running for @entity171 position before @entity6 took it @entity173 needed to get away - @entity174			1

@entity6 was appointed as @entity5 's new boss on monday
@entity6 has signed an 18 - month contract with the @entity18 club
@entity6 *enjoyed* a successful 11 years in charge of @entity91 before he was sacked as @entity4 boss after a troubled 10 months
