but it prompted an angry @entity43 row , with the @entity45 business secretary , @entity44 , describing it as ‘ stupid and offensive ’			0
@entity47 leaders have branded the campaign a ‘ nasty political stunt ’			2
@entity50 insisted the posters were attracting ‘ a great deal of interest ’ and confirmed that an evaluation of the pilot scheme could lead to it being rolled out more widely			0
a spokesman for the prime minister said : ‘ this pilot that is currently running is about targeting [ illegal immigrants ] and it is working			1

' it is simply a nasty political stunt by the @entity93 and it is a disgrace that the @entity10 is allowing itself to be used in this way ' @entity87 , @entity47 ‘ we would need a spectacular amount of convincing that it would be a good idea to expand this across the country			2
