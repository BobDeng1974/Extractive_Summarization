staring at myself in the mirror , i ’m shocked to see how different i look compared to five minutes ago			0
my eyes appear more intense , my face paler			0
i ’m thinking @entity5 , i ’m thinking queen elizabeth i , but brow expert @entity7 puts her finger on it			1
‘ weird , ’ she announces , staring at my new bleached eyebrows			1
‘ they bring out the blue of your eyes , although you do look a bit like an alien			0
’ eyebrows have become 2014 ’s most confusing beauty story			1
at the beginning of the year the ‘ @entity23 brow ’ — the high - arched , pencilled - in look so beloved by @entity26 ladies , wags and @entity29 women — was still in fashion			1
this year 's catwalk eyebrows trends have gone from one extreme to the other then model - of - the - moment @entity37 ’s unkempt version took off and we were all meant to walk around looking like we ’d never seen a tweezer in our lives			1
apparently , a brave few even tried the @entity43 brow , which is exactly as it sounds — curiously angled brows inspired by @entity46 ’s @entity45			1
thankfully , they never really took off			0
finally , last month @entity37 sashayed down the @entity48 runway at @entity49 with her iconic eyebrows bleached , hailing the arrival of the ‘ @entity52 ’			1
yes , you read that correctly , when it comes to grooming , fashionable women are increasingly skipping the tweezers and reaching for the peroxide instead and bleaching out their brows completely			1
@entity31 with her eyebrows kept natural			1
she has noticed that they are beginning to thin out with age @entity64 from @entity65 in @entity66 , @entity67 — who works with @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 — says there is a trend towards intense eyebrow maintenance because a groomed brow offers ‘ the cheapest alternative to a facelift			1
they define your features and frame your face			0
’ but which look should i go for ? i went to one of @entity67 ’s top hair salons to find out			1
i must admit my eyebrows are worrying me			1
while i ’ve always had naturally thick , curly hair , at 48 my eyebrows have started to look thin			1
they are still ok at the nose end but , towards my ears , the hairs seem to peter out			0
i have n’t dared pluck them or touch my eyebrows with a pencil in years , hoping that people will be distracted by my hair			1
i ’m not sure they ’re ready for the spotlight			0
at the @entity99 salon in @entity67 , things get off to a bad start when the redoubtable @entity99 — hair colourist to everyone from the @entity103 to @entity104 and @entity105 — inspects the guinea pig			1
‘ you do n’t have many eyebrows to speak of ! ’ she declares , before walking off			1
it ’s only when @entity7 appears that i relax			0
she takes one look and says : ‘ they ’re not thinning at all			2
they just need tidying up			0
’ i feel a weight taken off my shoulders			2
maybe i am normal after all			0
half of @entity7 ’s clients complain of balding brows			2
‘ they stop growing so well once you reach 40 , ’ she says , because of dropping levels of oestrogen			0
‘ and lots of young girls over-pluck them			0
’ @entity7 ’s brows are arched and well - defined			2
the type a cool corporate lawyer might sport			0
she tells me they ’re part - hair and part - tattoo			2
@entity7 offers customers a tattoo service for £ 400 that needs touching up once every six months			0
it sounds tempting , but i do n’t feel ready to commit yet			2
instead , i ’m escorted to the basins where @entity99 is going to peroxide my brows			1
@entity31 was n't a fan of the bleached look which she said made her look like an alien the process works the same way as other hair bleaching : a hydrogen peroxide paste is painted onto my eyebrows , which seeps into the hair shaft and disperses the colour molecules			1
the more colour molecules that get dispersed , the lighter your hair will become			2
it feels cold and slightly tingly but quite comfortable , and 20 minutes later i am declared ‘ done ’			0
@entity99 returns with a warm cloth and wipes the bleach off			0
‘ you look like you do n’t have any brows now ! ’ she says , with a booming laugh			2
i ’m sensing she ’s not a fan of my new look which , she tells me , has been copied by several ‘ trendy types ’ since @entity37 made her statement			1
but in general most people still do want to go the other way , i.e. dye blonde brows darker so their faces appear more striking , like @entity163 and @entity164			1
bleached or dark , there is no doubt women are paying much more attention to their brows nowadays			1
many tend to get a ‘ brow do ’ at the same time as their hair , a service that costs £ 15			1
‘ good eyebrows make you look healthy and feel confident , ’ @entity7 says			1
a report by market research company @entity177 shows that sales of brow products rose by 52 per cent between january and may			2
when i see mine in the mirror , i get a shock			0
@entity7 ’s right : bleached brows do bring out the colour of my eyes			1
and they emphasise my forehead as there ’s nothing separating my eyes from my hairline			0
at home , my boyfriend informs me i look less like @entity194 and more like @entity195 , with his helmet removed			0
he ’s got a point			0
it does n’t take me long to figure out the @entity199 look just does n’t suit me — if indeed it suits anyone			0
@entity201 soon went back to black after dabbling with the @entity199 this summer , as did @entity37 after the @entity48 show			0
i decide the blonde look is too bizarre even for the 21st century			2
possibly in a spirit of over- compensation , i return to the salon and ask @entity7 to give me the alternative @entity207			0
she tells me she prefers to call it a ‘ @entity210 ’ and begins drawing over my brows with a heavy black pencil , going slightly over the edge of my natural shape			2
as a guideline , the natural shape should be followed when creating a ‘ @entity210 ’ , but @entity7 says ‘ do n’t worry about elongating the thin end ’ , as this look is about being overly dramatic			0
i was prepared to hate it , but the big black brows against blonde hair make me feel powerful — like @entity222 circa the @entity223			1
yet as @entity225 home , i ’m aware of an older woman looking at me quizzically at the traffic lights			0
at the local corner shop i jokingly ask two twentysomething office workers if they think my big brows look ridiculous			2
‘ what do you mean ? ’ says one of them blankly , as if i ’m an idiot			0
‘ that ’s what eyebrows are supposed to look like these days , is n’t it ? it ’s down to that @entity240			2
’ i ’m glad i ’ve put myself through the eyebrow mill. i never realised there was so much potential in an eyebrow and i ’ve learned that they really are important , more important than mascara on lashes for lighting up your eyes and face			2
@entity31 says the the big black brows against blonde hair make her feel more powerful next month , @entity67 ’s eyebrow queen , @entity253 — whose clients include @entity104 , @entity255 and @entity256 — will be pioneering ‘ eyebrow extensions ’ where synthetic hair is stuck onto existing brows			1
it lasts for up to three weeks and costs £ 60			0
she ’ll also offer a stick - on brow service			2
although the full - on @entity37 may be a step too far , i will definitely pay more attention to my eyebrows in future , and have booked an appointment with @entity99 to get my brows tinted back to my natural shade			1
if i ’m brave enough , i might even try a tattoo top - up , but am still undecided			0
i ’ve always prided myself on being low maintenance in the beauty department , but have decided to add brows to my bi-monthly hair colouring treat			1
i hope it ’s not the start of a slippery slope !			0

this year 's catwalk eyebrows trends have been at both extremes
@entity283 has noticed her eyebrows are thinning with age
she tried catwalk eyebrow trends and was amazed at the difference
from the @entity23 brow to the @entity43 brow , eyebrow grooming is in vogue
@entity297 brows against blonde hair made her feel more powerful
women are skipping the tweezers and reaching for the peroxide
but she was n't a fan of the bleached look
