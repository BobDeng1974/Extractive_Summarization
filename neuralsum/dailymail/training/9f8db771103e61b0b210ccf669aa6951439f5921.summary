@entity1 fans sang ‘ we ’re going to win the league ’ , and were only half joking after this victory			1
manager @entity4 encouraged their optimism , suggesting his side could be playing in the @entity8 next season			1
@entity9 propelled @entity1 ahead of @entity11 title holders @entity10 to second in the table , with 19 points from nine games			1
their only hiccups so far have been a scoreless draw against @entity17 and away defeats by @entity18 and @entity19			0
@entity4 said their league position , just four points behind leaders @entity22 , did not flatter his side			1
‘ you can make up your own mind , but up to now maybe we deserve more points , ’ he said			0
‘ we lost at @entity18 when we deserved more , and maybe you can say the same when we lost at @entity19			0
’ @entity1 manager @entity4 celebrates his sides 1 - 0 win over @entity33 at full time @entity4 , who many thought would struggle to match @entity1 ’s eighth - placed finish under @entity36 last season , thinks a top - four spot is eminently possible			1
he said : ‘ when i look at the other teams around the top four , @entity10 have a great team , @entity22 are probably the most complete side at the moment , but the rest of them have not shown that they have a better team than us			2
‘ maybe there is an opportunity for us because @entity49 and @entity18 have a tough programme with @entity8 football , but they do have 25 or 26 players in their squads who are all internationals			2
@entity4 had special praise for @entity56 who played a key role in @entity1 's win over @entity33 ‘ we do n’t have that luxury , maybe that is one difference between us			1
@entity4 ’s new - look @entity1 have won all five of their @entity11 games in which they have scored first			1
‘ it ’s too early to say what we would like to win this season			0
when expectations are high , the best solution is to live day by day			0
‘ we enjoy being second in the table but it is only a start			0
’ @entity4 said @entity1 were no longer a surprise package after consistently proving themselves as an inventive but well - disciplined side , one that can put eight past @entity73 but has also conceded fewer goals than any other in the top four divisions			1
@entity77 ( not pictured ) scored the winning goal past @entity33 's @entity79 the new signings @entity4 made after the summer exodus again proved their worth			1
@entity83 midfielder @entity77 , bought from @entity84 for £ 11.8m in the summer , confidently scored from a rebound to put @entity1 ahead after 33 minutes			2
@entity77 , who had a strike against @entity73 harshly taken from him by the dubious goals panel , terrorised @entity88 down the left flank before scoring his first official goal for @entity1			0
@entity1 climbed above @entity10 in the @entity11 and dreaming of a top four spot again , @entity1 were regimented at the back , proving they are not the meanest defence in the league by accident			1
@entity4 singled out @entity97 loan signing @entity56 , who lifted the @entity99 title with @entity100 last season , for praise			0
the @entity103 said @entity56 was helping @entity1 ’s defence play like the best in the world			2
‘ he has been a strong influence - he has settled so well that it looks as if he has played in @entity110 football for two years already , ’ said @entity4			0
‘ last season he was playing for @entity100 , who probably had the best defence in @entity113 , and before that he was at @entity114			0
he has learned a lot about the game at a high level			0
’ @entity118 , whose @entity33 side were disappointing and missed a few chances to level in the second half , said @entity1 were a good blueprint for other clubs			2
‘ if you look back over the years @entity1 have spent big money on kids and that is why they are reaping the benefits of it , ’ he said , ‘ @entity33 have n’t had the benefit of that but in the future , given the investment of ( owners ) the @entity136 family into the club we will get a return on that money without a shadow of a doubt , but it will take time			2

@entity1 's win over @entity33 was their sixth in the last 10 games
@entity4 's saints are second in the @entity11 behind @entity22
