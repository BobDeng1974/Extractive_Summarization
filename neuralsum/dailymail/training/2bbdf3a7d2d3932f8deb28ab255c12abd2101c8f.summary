@entity0 is the kind of football ground usually described as ‘ homely ’			1
the stands are modest , the away section lies close by a field where cows may safely graze , and the entire place can accommodate 9,617 people , although the capacity is rarely approached			1
the refreshments , however , are said to be excellent , especially the bacon rolls , which cost £ 3 and have been deemed ‘ legendary ’ by visiting fans			1
on friday evening , those desirable rolls will sell as never before			1
the reason is what the @entity15 insists upon calling ‘ the magic of the @entity18 ’			2
a numbered wooden ball , plucked from a clacking bunch , dispatched @entity21 to @entity22 , to the delight of the corporation			1
it was for just such an occasion that the @entity15 invested in live football			2
@entity28 had long since annexed the @entity29 in a wad - waving swirl of @entity31			2
a board outside @entity33 shows @entity35 's next games with the @entity18 tie with @entity21 sandwiched between league games with @entity38 and @entity39 but the @entity18 was different ; competitive yet civilised , curiously quaint yet undeniably contemporary , and laden with almost 144 years of history			1
in short , it was an institution which simply reeked of class , and the @entity15 - in alliance with @entity43 - were mightily pleased with their acquisition			2
and here ’s the strangest thing : their satisfaction was absolutely justified , and friday ’s fourth - round tie will prove their point			2
unless both @entity52 and @entity53 take an almighty tumble at @entity55 , then @entity21 will not win the title			1
all the more reason , then , for @entity59 ’s team to pursue the @entity18 ; not only does ultimate victory guarantee a place in a relatively lucrative @entity63 competition , but it appeases the fans by delivering what the jargon calls ‘ silverware ’			2
it is a prize worth winning			2
a scarf pre-sale in preparation for the @entity18 match between @entity35 and @entity21 next week in recent years many have doubted its credentials , credulously believing that the @entity29 invented football in 1992			1
while this heresy suited those who gorged themselves on @entity80 ’s largesse , it crassly excluded clubs of modest means ; decent clubs like @entity84			2
for years they have existed on small change ; this week , they will enjoy national attention while reaping a reasonable reward			2
such is the effect of the @entity18			2
it is the stark contrast which makes the contest so alluring			2
@entity35 have raised their prices , with the lowest set at a reasonable £ 20			1
they are guaranteed to earn £ 234,000 from the tie , through television fees and @entity18 prize - money			2
in order to maximise their good fortune , they have decided to make all their staff buy their own tickets for the game			0
this policy has grievously upset at least one turnstile operative , who has grown used to a free place for @entity113 games and has therefore resigned in protest			0
@entity21 were drawn away at @entity35 in the @entity18 fourth round but the reality is that @entity35 have pressing overheads to meet , that their very existence has been at risk these past few years , and that they are therefore obliged to make the most of this fortuitous gift of a @entity18 tie			1
after all , they have to meet an annual staff salary bill of almost £ 1.25million			0
@entity21 have their own financial obligations			1
their staff wage bill for last season came in at £ 214.8m			0
they spent £ 150m in the last transfer window , and it is possible that they will hand over the same amount in the current month			0
their highest paid player , @entity133 , receives close to £ 300,000 every week , while they are currently debating the future of their striker @entity137			0
@entity133 is one of @entity21 's highest earners and will come up against @entity35 whose players earn far less than he does a marvellous performer , searching for his form , he is on a £ 6m loan from @entity144 , which will cost @entity21 £ 43.5m to make permanent			1
he is said to be earning anything up to £ 265,000 weekly , which means he would have to toil for almost five weeks to cover the cost of the @entity35 salaries			1
@entity133 could do it in four			0
in short , it is an uneven duel between a global corporation and a corner shop			1
and yet , and yet			0
nothing is decided , nothing is certain			0
which is why the city of @entity35 is in a state of tremulous excitement , why the @entity158 is offering fans ‘ a special goody bag for just £ 1 that includes a copy of the paper , a souvenir clap banner , a free poster and other items too ’			1
@entity166 celebrates scoring for @entity84 in saturday 's 4 - 0 win over @entity168 and why the @entity15 can show the tie at prime time on friday evening , knowing that viewing figures for the third round were 20 per cent up on last year and aware that the remote prospect of @entity21 coming a terrible cropper will have millions upon millions switching on to see the fun			1
for this is a competition which was born in the reign of @entity178 and the @entity29 of mr @entity179 and has proved an enduring ritual of our national life through the tenure of six monarchs and 25 prime ministers			0
‘ @entity191 ’ may be a desperate cliche but , in truth , there are times when only a cliche will do			0
@entity192 turns his delusion into an art form @entity192 just wo n’t be put down			1
having been out of the headlines for several days , he gave a toe - curling interview in which he said : ‘ i know the current captain would love to have me in the @entity200 team			0
’ to which @entity201 , the one - day skipper , swiftly responded : ‘ i ’m very happy with the squad of players i have			0
’ an ordinary man might have been crushed , but @entity192 seemed to take it as a challenge			1
so he promptly did something far more disturbing			0
he engaged the services of one @entity210 , who is apparently ‘ well regarded in the tattoo community ’ and was once dubbed ‘ @entity214 ’ by @entity213 magazine			0
@entity192 plays in the @entity216 @entity215 for the @entity217 and @entity210 , operating at a private clinic in @entity219 , drew a map of the world which started on @entity192 ’s chest and stretched around his ribs to his back			1
picked out in stars , like angry red weals , were the places in which he scored his hundreds for @entity200			0
now you may have your own views on tattooing			0
personally , i ’ve never understood the practice of allowing a chap who ca n’t draw to scrawl across your body in ink which can never be erased ; but each to his own			0
@entity192 posted a picture of his new tattoo showing all the places in the world he has scored a test century yet @entity192 ’s case feels different			1
it is as if he is actively refusing to recognise reality			0
like one who listens only to the twittering sycophants who tell him he has been grievously wronged , that one day @entity250 cricket will come to its senses			0
so @entity192 , wilfully deluded , takes himself off to @entity210			1
he then ambles topless along @entity253 , gauchely posing for the passing snappers			0
as the visiting psychiatrist remarked of the great @entity260 : ‘ there ’s enough material there for an entire conference			0
’ @entity261 from the moment @entity264 opened his mouth , we knew that his candidacy for the presidency of @entity268 was a joke			1
‘ corruption is not acceptable … everyone should have a smile on their face … we want to use the past for a better future ’			0
it was a splendid parody , even if he had been put up to it by a bunch of bookmaking chancers			0
he well deserves the £ 250,000 fee he is reportedly receiving			0
former @entity282 and @entity283 winger @entity264 says he plans to run for president of @entity268 despite the competition from @entity264 , @entity285 is expected to win the @entity268 election and yet , when it is all over , the odious @entity285 will once again be elected to the most powerful office in world football			1
now that is a far better joke … but nobody is laughing .			1

@entity21 vs @entity35 is like a global corporation taking on a corner shop
@entity192 turns his delusion into an art form
@entity264 's candidacy for the presidency of @entity268 is a joke *...* but the joke will be on us when @entity285 is *re-elected*
