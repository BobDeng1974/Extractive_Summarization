@entity0 fears @entity2 ' promotion bid could be derailed by the @entity5 side 's rollercoaster run of form			2
@entity7 suffered the first defeat of new boss @entity10 's six - game reign on thursday night as they slumped 3 - 0 at @entity11			1
it was an especially flat display after the high of recent @entity15 victories over @entity16 and @entity17			1
@entity0 fears @entity2 ' promotion bid could be derailed by the @entity5 side 's rollercoaster run of form the @entity20 - who remain behind the @entity23 side in third place on goal difference - now have five games left , starting with @entity27 on sunday , to leapfrog @entity17 and spare themselves the effort of playing two extra ties in the play - offs			1
finish third and they could even be sent back to @entity32 - where they have now lost twice this season - for another testing clash with @entity11 , provided @entity36 's side see off @entity37 in the race for fourth			2
but the worry for striker @entity0 is that @entity7 ' lack of consistency could wreck their chance of a @entity44 return			0
the 35 - year - old said : ' last night was a reminder that we have not turned the corner and that there 's a lot of hard work still to be done			0
@entity0 ( centre ) looks dejected as his @entity2 side slumped to a 3 - 0 defeat at @entity11 ' it was a performance that summed up out season a little bit			1
that ' consistency ' word has come up a lot this year			0
' we seem to have a couple of good performances and then complacency kicks in and we take our foot of the gas			0
' if we go back three games to the @entity17 result , i do n't think anyone could have seen that coming			2
fast forward three games and i do n't think anyone could have seen the result last night coming			0
' we have to nail down that consistency and get to a level of performance that we can pretty much guarantee every week			0
@entity2 had recently secured victories over @entity15 rivals @entity16 and @entity17 ' might this inconsistency come back to haunt us in the play - offs ? it could do , yes			1
' there is no point winning 1 - 0 or 2 - 0 at home and losing 3 - 0 away - that means you are out			1
' it 's about getting that level and balance right			0
we need to get back to where we were at against @entity17 and in the first half against @entity16 , where i thought we were superb			2
