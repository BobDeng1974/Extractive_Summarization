by @entity0 three businessmen accused of being involved in the illegal sale of stolen railway cable have been cleared of all wrongdoing after a judge said they were ‘ lured into breaking the law ’ by pushy undercover police officers			1
@entity8 , 47 , and @entity9 , 44 , who did not wish to be pictured , and business partner @entity10 , 47 , were among 17 suspects arrested during a police sting operation into scrap metal dealers who officers suspected might be trading in stolen items			1
but in a case of entrapment , it emerged two undercover officers posing as unscrupulous dealers had to visit the suspects ’ business premises no less than four times before they managed to persuade them to buy what appeared to be stolen cable			1
@entity10 , of @entity28 in @entity29 , was arrested after police suspected he was dealing in stolen metals following a sting operation the three men will be awarded costs which are expected to met by the taxpayer			1
and 14 other suspects will now have their cases reviewed in light of the judge ’s criticisms			2
mr @entity8 had initially refused their offers and demanded identification but the officers but they carried on repeatedly offering him dodgy items			1
he eventually agreed to take the cable only on condition the bogus vendors would n’t come back			0
soon after the operation in october 2012 mr @entity8 and his colleagues at @entity29 - based @entity49 were arrested and handcuffed during a string of coordinated 9am raids and charged with a string of offences including concealing criminal property			1
but almost two years on at @entity57 the case against the three men was thrown out after judge @entity58 condemned the officers for going too far in their pursuit of the three men			2
mr @entity61 , whose mother died whilst he was awaiting trial , said he was left suicidal by the botched investigation			1
he said : ’ it ’s been a nightmare			0
none of us have a criminal records and then this happened			0
‘ we said we did n’t want it because it looked like railway cable but they have gone out of their way to force innocent people like us into buying it			0
it was blatant entrapment and we have been made to feel like criminals who could potentially have been locked up			0
‘ on the day they swooped in with about 30 officers and cordoned off the street , there was even a helicopter			0
i did n’t know what was going on			0
we were locked up for 12 hours , it was n’t nice			0
’ mr @entity10 , who was cleared of all charges along with his colleagues after a judge said they had been ' lured ' into buying the dodgy metal , said he had been left feeling suicidal after the ordeal he added that the company has a robust procedure of checking identification from scrap dealers so when they are unable to present it , they are turned away			1
he even told the officers he was not supposed to buy burnt wire and if he was offered it he should report it to police			2
he said : ‘ in this job you have to use your initiative and we would tell people to get lost and would not accept some stuff			0
we took their ids and then kept saying we did n’t want it			0
we even refused stuff that was legitimate because it looked like railway cable even though there was no markings			0
’ ‘ to come in three times and know we were not accepting it they should have just walked away , but they ’ve pushed it to get a result			2
’ @entity28 check identification before buying scrap metal			1
after checking the undercover officers ' id they refused to buy the metal , but were persuaded after they came back four times following the charge , mr @entity61 said life became a daily struggle			1
he said : ‘ i loved this job and we will get back to where we were but some days i did n’t want to get out of bed because of this			0
i thought to myself some days , ‘ this is n’t worth it ’ and thought about getting a rope			0
i ca n’t trust the police now , and they are the ones we are supposed to be trusting			2
’ the court heard how undercover police officers first visited @entity28 metals on september 26 , 2012 posing as scrap dealers with metal to sell			1
mr @entity8 asked to see identification and refused to buy the aluminium metal cable he was offered , which was legitimate , but looked similar to railway cable			2
the officers went back to @entity28 metals again on october 9 , 2012 , and again mr @entity8 demanded to see identification			1
officers called at the firm again on october 16 , 2012 - their third visit - and offered mr @entity8 railway cable			2
he told them twice he could not take it and the officers asked how much he would pay for it if it was stripped			0
they returned later that day with the cable stripped of its identifying protective sheath and mr @entity8 bought it			0
when he was asked if he would take any more he told the undercover officers he would prefer not to have it			2
mr @entity8 , and mr @entity10 both of @entity166 , near @entity29 were both accused attempting to handle stolen railway cable and concealing criminal property			1
mr @entity9 , from @entity169 , @entity29 was accused of two charges of attempted handling of stolen property			1
all three have now been cleared of all @entity174 @entity58 said : ’ it is simply not acceptable that the state , through its agents , should have its citizens lured into breaking the law and then set out to prosecute them			1
‘ the reality of what the police did by going time and time again was to seek to wear down mr @entity8 ’s resistance to a point where he would then do something that could be characterised as a criminal offence			0

undercover police tried to sell dodgy metal to @entity29 scrap dealers
they visited @entity28 metals no less than four times before they sold the cables
@entity28 initially turned undercover offices away
but they caved in on the fourth visit
businessmen were charged with dealing in stolen goods and faced jail
judge cleared men and concluded they were ' lured into breaking the law '
but dealer @entity61 reveals he was left feeling suicidal by ordeal
now taxpayer must fund costs
