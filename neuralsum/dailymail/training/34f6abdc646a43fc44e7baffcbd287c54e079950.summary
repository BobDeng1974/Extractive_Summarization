@entity1 's season lurched to a new low when they suffered a 1 - 0 defeat to @entity4 that threatens their prospects in the @entity6			1
already struggling to keep pace in the @entity9 , @entity7 needs to find an immediate remedy for the problems that are ailing @entity1 to prevent a campaign that promised so much from completely unravelling			1
here , @entity13 identifies five key areas where things are going wrong for @entity1			1
the @entity16 whichever way you present the figures , there is no easy reading			0
one clean sheet in nine games since the beginning of the campaign – or eight shut - outs in 31 matches in all competitions during 2014 – means @entity1 are too easy to score against			1
confidence in the back line is being shredded and @entity7 can not find the right blend to make his team difficult to beat			0
he has not had a settled partnership in the middle of his defence since @entity36 and @entity37 were working in tandem at the end of 2012 - 13			2
nobody , from goalkeeper to central defenders , is prepared to take charge of the situation			0
‘ too soft and easy to beat , ’ were the withering appraisals of @entity7 and @entity67 as they trudged out of @entity68			0
nobody was inclined to disagree with them the lack of punch if the goals - against column is giving @entity7 headaches , so , too , will be the amount his team are scoring			0
bar one dazzling performance at @entity81 , when they cut @entity83 to ribbons , the verve and dash of last season has been absent			2
without @entity40 – more on him later – and the injured @entity85 , @entity1 do not have the pace to get in behind teams and the experiment of making @entity89 the spearhead of this unit is not working			1
he slows the team down and gives no intensity			0
@entity89 , the @entity94 striker signed for £ 16m from @entity95 , drew a blank for @entity1 in @entity97 @entity89 has scored just once since arriving at @entity98 while @entity99 has yet to open his account @entity1 never looked like getting @entity4 on the turn , bar one moment when @entity103 set @entity104 free , but the same has been true for the last month ; they created next to nothing against @entity106 , @entity107 and their play was often charmless against @entity109			1
the @entity111 players an outlay of more than £ 100million this summer should have been a sign for the creative responsibility to be shared between the squad but , so far , the same players are being asked to come up with results to save the team			2
@entity7 does not want to expose the 19 - year - old to burnout but his quality means he has played 764 of the 840 minutes of @entity1 ’s season so far			1
@entity122 in the list are @entity67 and @entity124 ( 720 minutes )			0
@entity104 has been the main attacking threat in the @entity1 line - up this season captain and midfielder @entity67 is @entity1 's joint - leading scorer this season there is more to it than that , however			1
@entity104 is also @entity1 ’s chief creator of chances and their join - leading scorer with @entity67			1
@entity7 needs other players to step forward to help the ease burden on two men at the opposite end of the age spectrum			2
injuries in fairness to @entity7 , he has been left without his main striker for a month through no fault of his own			2
@entity85 would almost certainly have had an impact on results during september , given his ratio for scoring goals , while @entity148 ’s energy and tenacity have been missed			0
‘ it has been frustrating at times but , day by day , we will be looking to get better , ’ said @entity7			0
‘ @entity148 never gets mentioned , and other guys like @entity154 and @entity153 returning will makes us a much stronger squad			0
but we are nowhere near technically where we were last season			0
’ @entity7 has n't been helped by injury to striker @entity85 @entity160 and @entity162 striker @entity85 has been out of action with an thigh injury sustained on international duty no x-factor there is no point wasting energy mourning the fact @entity40 is no longer at @entity98 but it is impossible not to see that @entity1 are now easy to play against without him			1
when @entity40 was leading the line , @entity1 had intensity			1
he scrambled the minds of defenders , created space for other to cause havoc and his presence in the team dragged his colleagues up another level			0
@entity40 helped himself to 31 @entity9 goals for @entity1 last season @entity40 left @entity1 for @entity42 in the summer in his place , @entity89 has done nothing so far to show why he has been afforded such adulation by his new supporters			1
he arrived with a big reputation - not all of it good , by any means - but it has been hard to see why there has been such noise around him			0
@entity1 began this campaign aiming to build on the 84 points they collected last year and they needed a special talent to come and take over from @entity40			1
what they did not require was someone who only wants to turn it on when it suits			0
somehow @entity7 has to unlock @entity89 's ability - and resolve the issues that are threatening to dash their dreams .			2

@entity1 went down to a shock defeat by @entity97 outfit @entity4 on *wednesday*
the @entity162 have lost four games already this season
£ 16m striker @entity89 has scored just one goal since arriving
at the other end , @entity1 have kept just one clean sheet in nine games
