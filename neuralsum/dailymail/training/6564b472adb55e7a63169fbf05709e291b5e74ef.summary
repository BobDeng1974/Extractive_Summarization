it did not take long for the severity to sink in			2
' the nurse explained @entity83 13 as the presence of an extra thirteenth chromosome , three instead of the normal two , ' she wrote on their website			2
' well much like anyone else i thought , " great extra ! extra is good , it ’s better than a little or too much " but i was wrong			2
' i quickly got off the phone and researched this @entity11 and my heart instantly sank			0
words like " severe mental retardation " , " death before age one " , " physical abnormalities " , and " incompatible with life " began to flood my screen			0

i just wanted him to cry			0
' sure enough , on april 4th , 2013 , @entity112 answered my prayers and at 9:53pm @entity121 at 4 pounds 4 ounces and 17 inches long was born breathing and crying			2
' but doctors told the @entity124 he would never live and gave him a less than one per cent chance of survival			2
the hours turned into days and days into weeks and now @entity129 is still going strong at 110 days old			1
and as he continues to amaze his family by merely living and fighting , the couple have created a bucket list for him and treat every day as if it was his birthday			1
it 's full of simple things that most children do but probably take for granted , like saying a word or sliding down a slide			2
more adventurous options include being on tv , meeting someone famous or petting a @entity142 's are hoping that little @entity129 gets to tick off every item on the list			1
