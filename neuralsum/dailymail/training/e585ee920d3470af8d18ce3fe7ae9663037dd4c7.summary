in a stunning clash of two branches of the @entity5 federal government , a @entity1 congressman told attorney general @entity6 on tuesday that he should be ' in jail ' instead of answering questions in a @entity10 hearing			1
@entity12 rep. @entity11 refused to ask @entity6 – the hearing 's sole witness – any questions , instead slamming him for defying congressional document subpoenas and ignoring a criminal contempt citation the @entity17 lodged against him nearly two years ago			1
' i 'm committed to maintaining the constitutional balance of power and the authority that this legislative branch has , ' @entity11 said , ' and i just do n’t think it ’s appropriate that mr. @entity6 be here			2
' ' if an @entity5 citizen had not complied with one of the @entity28 ’s subpoenas , they would be in jail and not sitting here in front of me testifying			1
the @entity17 voted in 2012 to hold @entity6 in civil and criminal contempt following the @entity28 's longstanding refusal to turn over documents related to @entity40			1
that program was a scandal - plagued gun - running exercise that put illicit weapons in the hands of hundreds of @entity49 nationals tied to drug cartels , beginning in 2009			1
the government has said it intended to track the guns , but it couldnt recover more than 1,300 of them			0
@entity45 , a @entity5 @entity45 agent , was killed in december 2010 with one of those weapons			0
other @entity40 guns have been tied to the deaths of about 200 @entity49 citizens			0
earlier in tuesday 's @entity35 hearing , @entity6 snapped at another @entity1 congressman , @entity75 , who upbraided him over his failure to produce everything @entity38 had subpoenaed			1
' sir , i 've read you what your department promised , and it is inadequate , ' @entity75 lectured			0
' and i realize that contempt is not a big deal to our attorney general , but it is important that we have proper oversight			2
' ' you do n’t want to go there , buddy , ' @entity6 warned the congressman			2
' you do n’t want to go there , okay ? ' hours earlier @entity1 @entity12 rep. @entity75 slammed @entity6 , saying a congressional vote of contempt is apparently ' not a big deal to our attorney general ' when @entity75 brought up the 2012 congressional criminal contempt citation against @entity6 , the attorney general snapped : ' you do n't want to go there , buddy ! ' most of the guns trafficked into @entity49 in the flawed ' @entity40 ' program wound up in the hands of drug lords and their henchmen , and some were used to commit murders -- on both sides of the @entity5 - @entity49 border @entity75 , a former @entity1 district court judge , fired back			1
' sir , we ’ve been trying to get to the bottom of @entity40 where people died , where at least a couple hundred @entity49 died , ' he said			0
' and we ca n’t get the information to get to the bottom of that , so i do n’t need lectures from you about contempt , because it is very difficult to deal with asking questions			0
' ' and i do n’t need lectures from you either , ' @entity6 sniped			0
@entity6 spent more than two hours defending his record as attorney general amid a sustained grilling from @entity12			1
' i 'll put my record up against any other attorney general , ' he insisted			2
' any hint that we have engaged in anything partisan in nature … i one - thousand - percent reject			0

@entity6 defended his record before a *hostile* panel of @entity12 *lawmakers* who wo n't let him forget that he was held in contempt of @entity38 in 2012
the @entity28 had refused to turn over documents related to its scandal - plagued ' @entity40 ' *gunrunning* fiasco
one @entity1 congressman refused to ask him any questions , saying that if the @entity28 had held any other @entity5 in contempt , he would be sitting in jail
another representative got @entity6 's goat by suggesting he did n't treat the criminal contempt citation with the *seriousness* it *deserved*
' you do n't want to go there , buddy ! ' the attorney general snapped
