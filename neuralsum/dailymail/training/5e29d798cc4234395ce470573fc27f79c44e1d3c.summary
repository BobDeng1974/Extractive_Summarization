by @entity0 last updated at 12:10 pm on 8th july 2011 questions : @entity3 interview tapes are being sought by prosecutors prosecutors in the @entity6 are demanding that a university hands over to @entity8 taped interviews in which former @entity11 members purportedly accuse @entity3 of running a secret death squad			1
researchers on an oral history project for @entity15 obtained the testimonies from two convicted @entity11 terrorists between 2001 and 2006			1
@entity3 , president of @entity18 , has always denied being an @entity11 member , let alone heading a unit which – in kidnapping , torturing and killing suspected informants – carried out some of its most brutal acts			0
the interviews being sought by @entity26 police are with @entity27 , who was head of the @entity11 in @entity28 , and @entity29 , who took part in the 1973 @entity32 car bombing and the unsolved killings of at least four people			1
both later fell out with @entity3 and @entity18 , criticising the @entity26 peace process			2
the college says the pair only agreed to talk on condition their taped confessions remained sealed and their identities protected until after their deaths			0
@entity27 died in 2008 , but @entity29 is still alive			0
lawyers for the college claim releasing the details ‘ prematurely ’ would not only damage the peace process but break the @entity11 ’s ‘ code of silence ’ and could lead to ‘ punishment by death ’			1
but @entity26 police want the tapes now , convinced they hold crucial clues to at least nine unsolved murders as well as kidnappings in @entity26 during the @entity53			1
bombings : @entity29 was in one of the interviews with @entity3 federal prosecutors have now asked a judge to order the university to comply under @entity6 treaty obligations with the @entity8			2
some of the testimony from @entity27 has already been used in a book and tv programme			0
in his interview , he spoke about serving alongside @entity3 and claimed the @entity18 leader was involved in the 1972 murder of @entity68 , a mother of ten from @entity28			0
@entity3 has denied being involved in the killing , claiming @entity27 was ‘ not well ’ at the time he gave the interview .			0

two convicted @entity11 terrorists told researchers in @entity6 of his involvement
lawyers for @entity15 argue their release would damage peace process and break @entity11 ' code of silence '
police believe tapes can help solve up to nine murders as well as kidnappings during the @entity53
@entity11 *godfather* @entity87 *yesterday* lost his appeal against a *landmark* civil action that *branded* him the *mastermind* behind the omagh bombing *atrocity* . he had tried to *overturn* an historic court victory *won* by relatives of some of the 29 people murdered in the 1998 *attack* . but a judge at @entity98 *dismissed* his appeal , and that of his right *-* hand man , @entity101 .
