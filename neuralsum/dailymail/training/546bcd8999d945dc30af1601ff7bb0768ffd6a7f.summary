@entity0 recalls his experience of @entity2 at the end of this month , i ’ll gather with old pals at a restaurant in @entity7			1
now in our mid- 40s , we ’ll reminisce about the school we were all at in the late - @entity10			1
we meet every few years ; among our group are a property developer and an estate agent , a chap who runs a business making snuff , and a jewellery trader			2
then there ’s the best - selling thriller writer @entity19 and me , a food writer and @entity22 judge			1
but this time our conversations will have added frisson because our old school , @entity25 , in @entity26 , has been in the news			1
musing about his school teachers in an article for a magazine , @entity28 wrote about his experiences of @entity2			1
‘ i had only ever stayed one night away from home and i was sleepless for six months before going			1
but it was the done thing so off i went … straight into survival mode , ’ he wrote			1
the place was ‘ cold and unpleasant … quite tough , with a slightly terrifying headmaster and military - style drill in the morning … once a week , boys deemed stupid or lazy were beaten really unpleasantly with a cane on bare buttocks			1
’ this is not the first time that @entity44 has been the subject of public comment			1
in his memoir of childhood , @entity48 , the former poet laureate @entity47 writes about @entity44 as a prison run by sadistic sociopaths			1
@entity47 said the then headmaster @entity53 ‘ enjoyed beating ’ the boys			1
indeed , there did n’t seem to be a crime that did n’t merit a caning on the buttocks			2
‘ he beat us if we did badly at work , if we were cheeky , if we walked with our hands in our pockets , if we left the middle button on our jackets undone , if we walked on the grass by the statue standing on one leg , if we slammed doors , if we barged ahead of masters , if we swore , if we made a mess in our lockers , if we did n’t have our towels , if we had fights , if we damaged the flowers , if we hid our food			1
’ in an interview in 2005 , @entity47 explained that ‘ there were two kinds of beating			1
there was beating at the end of the day in our dormitories where the head came round and slippered people , and there was “ the swish ” ( cane ) administered in his study			2
this was in the early @entity92 , but the regime was dickensian			2
’ reviewing @entity96 ’s memoir , fellow schoolboy @entity94 admitted that the ‘ regime of constant corporal punishment [ would today ] land the perpetrator in prison ’			1
@entity44 in @entity101 ( pictured ) is fondly remembered by many , but @entity28 described it as ' cold and unpleasant ' yet how do those views chime with my memories , and those of my pals ? we hardly seem a traumatised bunch when we gather to reminisce			1
as @entity19 says : ‘ it was an eccentric place but with a good heart			1
’ the school is an austere building constructed around four towers and partly clad in dark brown @entity26 stone			1
the grounds are vast and include a large wooded area known as the @entity117 and a lake			2
i was still seven when i arrived to board			2
the place seemed huge to me , as did the older boys			2
it seems strange now to think that i found 12 - year - old boys terrifying ! we slept in dormitories on rickety beds whose springs sagged in the middle , and we knew to stop mucking about when we heard the matron , mrs @entity130 , approaching ; her high heels clickety - clacking on the wooden floors			2
the headmaster was a man called @entity134 who may have had a rather terrifying appearance , but nevertheless had a good sense of humour			2
as he came around the dorms to say goodnight , we would set traps above the door so that when he entered a cascade of books and shoes would rain down on to his bald and shiny pate			2
he would then chase us around the room and put whoever he caught across his knee for a mild slippering			0
as we gathered in the dining room to eat tea , the head - boy would read out a list of the day ’s miscreants who were instructed to ‘ come down ’			1
for some reason , i was often on it — although it was never a short list			0
well - educated : after attending @entity25 , the @entity28 , pictured , went on to study at @entity159 then @entity160 the condemned would stand in a line in the hall outside the headmaster ’s study , and the head boy would appear			1
to the right of the hall ’s fireplace was an alcove , from where the head boy would retrieve a pair of crimson slippers			0
these he then carried along the line of boys and into the study			0
i was whacked so often that for about ten years after i was always nervous come tea - time			0
for graver misdemeanours it was not the slippers but the cane			0
for this we were instructed to take down our trousers and kneel on a footstool			0
i was caned frequently for not working hard enough			0
but it did n’t seem to make much difference to my attitude			0
neither did my parents ’ attempt to make me work harder with bribery : 20p for a better grade			2
it was n’t until i got my @entity195 results from the headmaster — i was told bluntly : ‘ @entity0 , you failed ! ’ , which meant i could not go on to my next school — that i was shocked into working			1
i re-took it and passed			0
meanwhile , the school ’s staff were straight out of an @entity204 comedy			0
there was mr @entity206 who styled himself on @entity207			0
he had the haircut and moustache , ( and drove a grey @entity210 ) and referred to himself as @entity207			0
he would divide our class into two groups : imbeciles and morons , and when he was n’t teaching us history taught the principles of ‘ treacle mining ’			1
there were even questions on ‘ treacle mining ’ in our exams			1
it was only years later that it occurred to me the concept of molasses being mined and then processed into treacle was @entity207 ’s humorous hoax			0
there was the odd - job - man , mr @entity230			0
he lived above a barn amid cats and straw , and when he wanted to visit @entity101 ( a mere ten miles away ) he would always walk			0
and there was @entity235 , the assistant matron who we were all in love with : we would go to great pains to try to get her to help us have a bath			0
the days always started with every pupil and there about 80 of us — on parade at the front of the school			2
there we lined up to do star - jumps			0
we were next outdoors at break - time , where gang warfare would erupt			0
the older boys would capture a few younger ones ( ‘ squits ’ ) and take them into the @entity117 , where they had dug out a den and made a roof out of corrugated iron			1
after some gentle torture , it would be back inside and more lessons			0
i was caned frequently for not working hard enough , says former pupil @entity0 we called masters ‘ sir ’ and any female staff ‘ please ’ , we had to tip our plates at meal - times to show we had wiped them clean ( often a struggle , i recall lots of cabbage ) and on sunday mornings had to write two sides of @entity268 to our parents			1
i did n’t contribute much on the games pitch and neither did i enjoy the compulsory dips in the outdoor , unheated swimming pool			0
yet many of our hours were filled with roaming the grounds , climbing trees and feeling free			0
we were always glad to return after an away match at some other boarding school where the buildings seemed more austere and smelled of dirty laundry and the food was far worse			0
to this day , walking through the school in my mind , i can remember every corner of the place			2
it ’s a rather softer , cosier institution today , not least because they ’ve introduced girls			0
i gave a talk there a couple of years ago , in the main hall where once we were taught dancing and watched black - and - white movies from an ancient projector			0
the whole school assembled , and as i finished my talk on food history there was a vast sea of hands with eager questions			0
@entity44 always did encourage thought and independence			1
and when we old boys gather in a few weeks , we ’ll shrug off the slipperings and cold dips , and look back fondly on the adventure we all had there when we were little .			1

@entity28 described @entity44 in @entity26 as ' cold and unpleasant '
but fellow pupil @entity0 he and his friends ' hardly seem a traumatised bunch when we gather to reminisce '
as @entity19 says : ‘ it was an eccentric place but with a good heart ’
