@entity0 is steadily becoming a nation of ' ghost towns ' - with empty apartment blocks , streets and weed - filled gardens where bustling communities were supposed to move			1
entire housing estates built during the country 's boom years have been left abandoned , bricked up and now on sale for almost half their original price			1
one such settlement is @entity14 , dubbed the @entity15 of @entity16 for its towering apartments and proximity to the capital , where 30,000 people were due to live			1
loneliness of the long - distance ruuner : a jogger in the shadows runs past empty apartment blocks in @entity14 , a 45 - minute drive south of @entity16 , where 30,000 people were due to live of the 13,000 homes due to be built , only 5,100 were completed - most of them now uninhabited and the @entity27 who bought them as investments now competing to offload them for huge losses			1
@entity0 's housing market crash and economic implosion have turned what was supposed to become a vibrant suburban paradise for young @entity0 couples and their children into one of the most visible monuments of the country 's boom gone bust			1
such modern - day ghost towns have become a familiar part of the @entity0 landscape , abandoned shells left to slowly decay			1
the number of foreclosure proceedings skyrocketed during the economic crisis			0
@entity51 plains : landscaped areas , which were due to be built on , lie vacant on the outskirts of ghost town @entity14 as the @entity0 housing crisis continues to take its hold nearly 530,000 were granted by courts from 2008 through september of 2011 , most to banks taking homes , housing developments and vast tracts of land for residential and commercial real estate projects that may never become reality			1
the banks were ordered this month by the recently elected centre - right government to set aside billions of additional euros to cover these toxic real estate assets valued at 175billion euro just as @entity0 teeters on the edge of what could be a lengthy recession			1
@entity0 now has more than 5million people ( 22.9 per cent of its residents ) out of work - and recent growth data suggests the situation is only going to get worse			1
the country 's economy shrank , by 0.3 per cent , for the first time in two years in the fourth quarter of 2011			0
economists believe it is the start of what could be a prolonged slump as @entity16 implements harsh austerity measures to deflate a massive budget deficit			1
the country already has the highest unemployment figure in @entity89			1
@entity91 economist @entity90 said : ' some countries in the eurozone may just avoid a recession , but that may be more difficult for @entity0			2
' given the need for fiscal consolidation in the country and the pressure that puts on domestic demand , it â€™s going to be very difficult for @entity0 to avoid recession			2
' economic output in the 17 - nation single currency area fell 0.3 per cent in the fourth quarter from the third , official data showed yesterday as the sovereign debt crisis crushed a recovery and looked set to push the bloc in to a mild recession			0
the @entity111 economy joined @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114 in formal recession having already shrunk in the third quarter of 2011			0
purchasing data from @entity118 for january showed a slight improvement for the @entity0 manufacturing and services industries , but it may not be enough for an economy that has been in recession or close to stagnation for almost five years			2
@entity0 had been growing at an above - average rate since the country entered into the eurozone monetary union 12 years ago , but the boom was largely due to the housing expansion fuelled by cheap loans and has been struggling since the 2007 crash			1
experts say the government 's new provisions for real estate holdings will almost certainly prompt the banks to sell holdings at firesale prices , forcing property values down much more than the 22 per cent that they have dropped since the financial crisis hit @entity89 in 2008			1
in @entity14 and other ghost developments around @entity0 , some banks are already trying to unload finished apartments at discounts of up to 50 per cent of their original prices			1
but that is hurting untold numbers of @entity27 who invested savings and took out big loans to buy property they thought they would be able to sell for more money or rent			0
satellite cities that never ended up with populations are not @entity0 's only problem			2
around @entity16 and across the country , there are vast subdivisions carved out of farmland complete with paved roads and streetlights but only weeds where houses were supposed to be built			1
half - built apartment buildings stand idle in suburbs rich and poor			2
with unemployment at a eurozone high of 23 per cent , there are simply fewer buyers - and young @entity27 are increasingly trying to find work abroad			0
in december alone , sales were down 25.3 per cent compared to the same month in 2010 , the government reported last friday			0
' this is the problem : who is going to buy these homes ? ' said @entity181 , head of the economics department at the @entity183			0
it could take years for the banks to clean up their assets and relieve a growing credit crunch affecting individuals and businesses , some of whom never got caught up in the @entity0 real estate craze in which most citizens bought real estate as an alternative to savings accounts , investment funds and retirement plans			2
the boom and bust has been so profound that the impact is changing the @entity0 mentality about real estate , said @entity204 , head of research at @entity0 's most popular real estate website , @entity208			2
@entity27 , he said , for the first time do not believe parents who have told them for decades that they should always buy instead of rent and treat real estate as an investment that will never go bad			0
the age - old saying in @entity0 that prices never go down or not for long ' is now broken ' , @entity204 said			1
no neighbours : one resident of @entity14 bought a three - bedroom apartment with a terrace for 185,000 euro but is now stuck in a city that has no public transport or even a pharmacy ' we 're starting to see people who must sell with losses they would have never accepted in the past , ' @entity204 said			2
' and some of these homes are never going to be sold			0
' @entity0 's development ministry estimates there are 687,000 unsold new homes for sale			1
other studies put the number as high as 1.6million in the nation of 47million , where 80 per cent of the population already lives in owned homes , a rate much higher than nations like @entity240 , @entity241 , @entity111 and the @entity242			2
there is no government figure for used homes for sale , but estimates range into the millions			0
the value that the banks put on the property just is n't real , ' @entity247 said			0
' and as a result the banks do n't trust each other , they are n't lending to each other and if they do n't lend to each other there 's no credit for @entity27			0
' @entity257 bought his three - bedroom @entity14 apartment with a terrace overlooking the residents ' pool in 2008 for 185,000 euro after his retired father jumped into the real estate action to buy the same style of apartment at a lower pre-construction price			1
landlord 's nightmare : a chauffeur who bought a property in @entity14 has dropped his rental value by a third but said finding anybody to move in ' like winning the lottery ' father and son were both convinced housing prices would continue to rise as they had since the mid- 1990s			1
they now are stuck with homes in a development that does not have a pharmacy or good public transport to @entity16			1
the only pizza restaurant is open just three nights a week and on saturday afternoon when there are enough clients to justify operating , and the roast chicken takeaway only opens friday nights and saturday afternoons			0
apartment blocks have ground floor commercial space for small businesses so people can walk to buy whatever they need			0
but most units are sealed by brick walls scrawled with cell phone numbers of owners offering to sell or rent them			0
tough decisions : @entity0 prime minister @entity298 is having to implement massive budget cuts to save the country from bankruptcy the 33 - year - old @entity302 , an unemployed chauffeur , last rented his apartment for 750 euro a month two years ago , and is now asking just 500 euro per month			1
similar apartments are being offered at 375 euro monthly , but he is asking for more because his is in immaculate condition with new furniture and appliances			0
his father , @entity309 , is offering his apartment for sale at 108,000 euro , meaning he stands to lose tens of thousands of euros in a bid for retirement cash now that he 's reached age 67			0
but banks selling foreclosed property in @entity14 have smaller apartments listed as low as 65,000 euro			2
' selling or renting now is like winning the lottery , ' said the younger @entity302 , who lives with his parents and shells out 500 euro of his 700 euro monthly unemployment cheque to pay his mortgage and other apartment costs			0
in the town of @entity327 more than an hour 's drive from @entity16 , 9,000 apartments and small houses were supposed to be built in a bucolic country setting next to a high - speed train station so workers could get downtown in less than 20 minutes			1
but only 1,500 were finished before developers went broke , 3,000 people live there instead of the projected 30,000 and government officials never launched the train service			0
' the station is built , the trains are bought but they never started running , ' said mayor @entity343			0
the 240,000 euro home he bought would now sell for about half the price			0
the population in @entity327 is increasing somewhat as banks sell off foreclosed properties at low prices , but @entity343 said it could be decades if ever before the rest of the land is developed			0
' nothing 's going to happen until the @entity0 economy comes back , ' he said			2
' right now no one is thinking about building anything in @entity0			2
' @entity356 , @entity14 's mayor , said the development fiasco has one positive side : @entity0 real estate speculators are n't snapping up apartments any more in his town			1
those that are buying ' are people who are going to come here to live , pay their taxes and want the place to be nice for their children			0
