@entity1 ’s @entity0 did not march in great numbers , but the heiress apparent to @entity4 as the glamour queen of tennis took a significant step towards the queen of @entity9 on tuesday night			1
should @entity10 ultimately face @entity11 in the fourth round , what a royal clash of generations it would be , pitting the 32 - year - old winner of five @entity9 singles titles against a 20 - year - old rapidly emerging as one of the biggest draws in the game			1
both women took positive strides , @entity11 battering @entity22 into a one - hour defeat with only three games wasted , while no 13 seed @entity10 won the pick of the first - round ties , scuffling past @entity28 7 - 5 , 7 - 5			1
victory : @entity10 celebrates her 7 - 5 , 7 - 5 victory over @entity28 slam : @entity28 tries to force the speed of the game on @entity33 on tuesday by the standards of this @entity36 — like her three siblings she was named after a royal — it was a muted performance and a muted occasion			1
she is more familiar to whoops and wolf whistles from crowds , not to mention the shower of stuffed toys that tends to accompany her victories			0
there are social networks dedicated to planning the movements of ‘ @entity0 ’ around @entity50			0
not at the @entity51 , though			0
‘ i saw a few single members of @entity55 — but it ’s @entity9 , so we ’re a little bit more subdued here , ’ she said last night , cradling a stuffed @entity53			2
‘ because i ’m a princess , ’ she explained			0
but generally the mood was heavier			0
the woman with a soft touch and a hard streak — she has an on - court glare and fist - pump not dissimilar to @entity4 ’s — was far from her best against a strong opponent			2
@entity28 has fallen to no 35 in the world , but she has been as high as no 5 and last year reached the quarter - finals of the @entity70			1
@entity71 : but the @entity36 was too quick and strong for her @entity73 opponent gracious : the 20 - year - old waves to the crowd after the victory ready to win : @entity10 poses for @entity79 's exclusive photoshoot last week the @entity73 broke @entity10 three times and , indeed , led by a break in each set			1
with a more dependable second serve , @entity28 would have had a reasonable chance			2
@entity10 , who won @entity9 on this court two years ago and has this year reached the semi-finals of the @entity88 and @entity89 opens , added : ‘ i definitely feel like i did n’t play my best most of the match , but i raised my level at some big points ... at 5 - 5 in both sets			1
‘ i felt like i was a bit inconsistent			0
the first match of a tournament , especially a @entity97 , is always a bit nervy			0
i think there was a bit of nervous tennis out there			0
’ @entity103 day 2 review			2

@entity10 beats @entity28 7 - 5 , 7 - 5 on day two at @entity9
