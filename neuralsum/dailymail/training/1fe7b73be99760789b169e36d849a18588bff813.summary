this is the explosive moment the @entity2 navy blew up one of its own ships to test out their latest long - range stealth missile			1
the @entity6 , a 300ft long decommissioned frigate , was transported out into the sea off the coast of @entity10 to be used as target practice			1
dramatic footage released by military bosses captures the countdown before the new ' @entity15 ' - a four - metre long , 880lb weapon - is fired in the direction of the vessel			1
the @entity15 is a sophisticated anti-ship and land - attack weapon developed especially by @entity2 defence and aerospace firm @entity52			2
the 880lb missile is propelled towards its target at subsonic speed by a @entity58 turbojet			1
it is almost four metres long and carries a 125kg warhead which is capable of destroying or severely damaging any naval vessel			1
fitted with a gps system , it can travel stealthily over coastline , oceans and land			0
this agility means it can also pull off last - minute g - force maneuvers to prevent getting shot down			2
the combination of an imaging infrared ( @entity72 ) seeker and an onboard target database ensures that the missile can seek out and detect targets up to 100 nautical miles away with pinpoint precision			1
the subsonic missile , which has a range of up to 150km , smashed straight into the frigate with pinpoint accuracy			2
video from onboard the @entity6 , shows the frightening moment of impact as a huge fireball erupts and debris spews hundreds of feet into the air			1
the vessel suffered major damage as a result of the 275lb warhead and was towed back into a harbour following the exercise			2
@entity93 , who oversaw the operation , said : ' the damage to the target ship was as expected and cleanup went according to plan			0
' @entity99 are the latest generation surface warfare missile system from @entity101 defence firm @entity52 and are currently being used by the @entity2 navy			0
the @entity104 navy is also set to arm themselves with the weapon			0
@entity52 is also developing a @entity106 ( @entity106 ) for the @entity107 used by the @entity108 and @entity110 's @entity109			0
such an overt display of military strength is unusual for @entity2 , a traditionally neutral country			0
it was forced to enter @entity114 after being invaded by @entity115 in 1940 , but the resistance lasted only two months			0
today , the @entity117 consists of around 3,700 personnel and 70 vessels including frigates , patrol boats and submarines			0
sophisticated : the @entity15 was developed by @entity2 defence firm @entity123 over the past three years deadly : the missile , circled in red , is four - metres long and weighs 880lb warfare : the subsonic missile is about to hit the centre of the 300ft vessel causing significant damage lethal : the extent of the damage to the stricken vessel is clearly visible before it towed back to the harbour			1
