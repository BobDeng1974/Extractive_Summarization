@entity0 was holding out for a ray of economic hope yesterday after @entity3 went up in flames as mps voted for a savage austerity bill			1
early indications were that the markets , at least , were happy , with the @entity9 leaping 53.31 points to 5905.7 in @entity11 – its strongest close since late july			0
it came after @entity0 politicians backed a package of unpopular cuts in exchange for a £ 110billion rescue from the @entity19 and @entity20			1
no movie : the historic @entity23 cinema in @entity3 seen here after being set ablaze aftermath : a man picks his way through the wreckage of @entity3 but despite the surge in the markets , popular anger simmered as @entity3 cleaned up after almost 100 buildings were set alight by rioters while parliament voted on sunday night			1
the stench of tear gas still hung in the air yesterday as firefighters doused smouldering buildings and rubble was swept from the streets after a night of violence during which stores and cafes were smashed and looted			2
at least 170 people were hurt as riot police clashed with more than 2,000 black - hooded anarchists carrying clubs and petrol bombs			1
police arrested at least 74 people and detained a further 92			1
the sight of flames engulfing cinemas , shops and banks in the capital underscored the sense of deepening turmoil in the country after more than four years of recession and two of punishing austerity			0
riots also spread to the second city , @entity66 , and even the holiday islands of @entity68 and @entity69			0
the proposed austerity package includes cuts in pay , jobs and pensions , with the state workforce reduced by 150,000 by 2015 and the minimum wage slashed by 22 per cent			1
ruined : workers clear a burned out cafe in central athens @entity80 destruction : @entity0 is billions of euros in debt and struggling to pay its debts , a situation which will not be helped by the riots destruction : a tear - gas choked @entity3 awoke to what looked like a war zone yesterday morning - the result of riots the cash - strapped country can ill afford @entity0 needs its bailout cash by march 20 so it can meet debt repayments of £ 12billion and prevent a chaotic default that would send shockwaves through the eurozone			1
the austerity bill was welcomed by investors and stock markets across @entity103 amid hopes that a eurozone meltdown will be avoided			0
‘ @entity0 has passed a major hurdle in voting for more austerity and in doing so averting a messy default , ’ said @entity106 , a currency analyst at @entity107			1
‘ @entity0 ’s crisis , however , will continue to play out for years			2
there appears to be a growing sense that a @entity103 monetary union without @entity0 may eventually become politically acceptable			2
’ vandalised : this shop was trashed by rioters during sunday night 's violence against harsh new austerity measures hard day 's work : a fireman douses a burned out building with water the vote paves the way for @entity0 's international creditors to release 130 billion euro in new rescue loans to prevent the country from a potentially catastrophic default next month			1
@entity131 could push @entity0 out of @entity103 's euro currency union , drag down other troubled eurozone countries and further roil global markets			2
vandalised : a man passes the defaced facade of the @entity137 there was nevertheless strong dissent over the austerity package among the majority @entity141 and rival conservatives who make up @entity0 's interim coalition government			1
the parties disciplined the dissenters in their ranks , with the @entity141 and conservatives expelling 22 and 21 lawmakers respectively , reducing their majority in the 300 - member parliament from 236 to 193			0
@entity154 gave the vote result a cautious welcome , with foreign minister @entity157 describing it as ' a first significant step along the right road '			0
he said : ' however , the actual difficult work with implementing the reforms that have been agreed on is only just starting now			0
' that is the decisive precondition for @entity154 and the other euro partners being able to stand by @entity0 with a further rescue package			1
embarking on implementation is decisive now			0
' ' these decisions show the will and readiness of the @entity0 to make great efforts of their own ... to put the country on the right track , ' @entity154 chancellor @entity169 's spokesman , @entity168 , said in @entity174			2
he said : ' these measures , and we really have to note this , are not just saving for the sake of saving , they are not cutting for the sake of cutting - this is about reforms in every political area			2
' these are measures that are meant to restore step by step the financial room for manoeuvre that the country needs for new jobs and new growth to emerge			0
' gutted : more than 45 buildings in central athens were destroyed in the riots work : firemen make a central @entity3 building safe after it was hit by rioters @entity154 's vice chancellor and economy minister , @entity201 , also said the vote was ' a step in the right direction '			1
he said : ' it is good that the legislation has now been approved , with a broad majority too , but what is decisive is the implementation of structural reforms			0
' the legislative process is one thing , implementation is another - i would like to recall again that there have been tax laws for a long time and the fact that they were not adhered to sensibly is part of the problem			0
' @entity201 noted that the upcoming report by @entity0 's international debt inspectors from the @entity224 , @entity225 and @entity20 , known as the ' troika ' , will be key to determining whether the measures @entity3 has taken suffice to allow the country to carry its debts and get further aid			1
he said : ' the pressure that @entity154 built up in @entity103 was right in order at least to move @entity0 further in this right direction			2
' sunday 's clashes erupted after more than 100,000 protesters marched to the parliament to rally against the drastic cuts			0
anger : a petrol bomb explodes near riot police in @entity3 as lawmakers looked set to endorse a new austerity deal riots : a man throws a missile as protesters clash with riot police ' there 's no question that there 's quite a lot of anger in the population			2
there is quite a lot of frustration , ' said social and economic analyst @entity256			0
' however i do not think that these rioters represent all these demonstrators that were mostly peaceful yesterday			0
' and the @entity224 also welcomed the @entity0 parliament 's decision to approve tough new austerity measures			1
economics commissioner @entity265 urged @entity0 officials to ' take ownership ' and fully implement the reforms , demanded by the @entity19 in return for a huge bailout			1
the new bailout deal , which has not yet been finalised , will be combined with a massive bond swap deal to write off half the country 's privately held debt , reducing @entity0 's debt load by about 100 billion euro			2
but for both deals to materialise , @entity0 has to persuade its deeply sceptical creditors that it has the will to implement spending cuts and public sector reforms that will end years of fiscal profligacy and tame gaping budget deficits			1
@entity285 finance ministers are to meet on wednesday to approve the plan , after refusing to do so during a meeting last week , saying @entity3 had to first approve the new austerity measures			1
@entity289 battles : a protester kicks a tear gas canister fired into the crowd of protesters fireworks and projectiles are aimed at the @entity0 parliament during the violent anti-austerity protests before signing off on the bailout , the eurozone ministers will still want @entity0 political leaders to commit in writing to uphold the austerity plan even after the general election in april			2
finance minister @entity304 insisted the country 's economic survival hinged on the passage of the new measures			0
' the question is not whether some salaries and pensions will be curtailed , but whether we will be able to pay even these reduced wages and pensions , ' he said in @entity315 before the vote			0
' when you have to choose between bad and worse , you will pick what is bad to avoid what is worse			0
' the further cuts come after two years of deep spending cuts and repeated tax hikes that have sent unemployment soaring to more than 20 per cent and left the country struggling through a fifth year of recession			0
those measures were taken in return for a first , 110 billion euro package of rescue loans from other eurozone countries and the @entity20 , but despite the cutbacks , @entity0 repeatedly failed to meet its fiscal targets in reducing its debt and deficit and increasing economic competitiveness			1
