he ’s used to being the center of attention , but on wednesday night @entity3 was left playing second fiddle to @entity6 starlet @entity5 when the pair appeared as guests on the @entity9 on @entity11 television			1
the last time the mayor of @entity13 appeared with @entity14 he was the star attraction and enjoyed a healthy rapport with his host , but things were much more brisk and business - like this time around			2
when @entity21 overran her slot while promoting the latest @entity25 movie , @entity3 ' interview got squeezed to under five minutes - less than half of what he had when he appeared in 2012			1
things did n't improve when the interview finally started and @entity14 congratulated him on his re-election - something which had actually happened before @entity3 ’s previous appearance almost two and a half years ago			2
as well as promoting his new book , @entity11 - born @entity3 used his shortened slot to boast about how well @entity13 is doing under his leadership			0
‘ things are going gangbusters , ’ said @entity3 – no doubt perplexing the audience at home – as he claimed responsibly for reductions in the crime and murder rates and even people living longer			0
exiting together : @entity5 urged @entity14 not to retire and said he should work until he dies @entity21 appeared confused when discussing the latest @entity25 movie and she admitted that having completed two films at the same she really does n't know which one she 's talking about at any given time quoting @entity65 left many in the audience perplexed , but @entity3 at least managed to win a round of applause when he said that the recent success of the @entity72 games in @entity13 was testimony to @entity74 love for all things @entity11			1
but even then @entity3 admitted he found @entity76 to be ‘ too theoretical ’ and instead professed his love for rugby			0
‘ some of my happiest hours were spent being ground into the mud , ’ he recalled			0
@entity14 then brought the conversation round to @entity82 and the search for @entity84 , the @entity85 - accented executioner			1
' if the chap wants to see 72 virgins , i think he should be able to meet them as soon as possible , ' said @entity3 with his best quip of the night			1
@entity13 mayor @entity3 admitted he found @entity76 to be ‘ too theoretical ’ and instead professed his love for rugby			0
' some of my happiest hours were spent being ground into the mud , ' he recalled with his time quickly running out , @entity3 finally got to talk about his book , the @entity96 : how one man made history , which he had flown over from the @entity85 especially to promote			0
however @entity3 's reasons no doubt left many viewers perplexed as he said he wanted to teach children in the @entity85 that @entity102 was more than just a toy dog in an insurance commercial			2
earlier @entity5 had laughed and joked with @entity14 about her health issues and she urged him not to retire and carry on working until he dies			2
she also appeared confused when discussing the latest @entity25 movie , @entity106 1 , and admitted that having completed both it and part 2 at the same time she gets the two movies confused			0
looking as crumpled as ever in a black suit and blue tie , bumbling @entity3 got off to a bad start when he almost walked into the set when it finally became his turn to take center stage			1
