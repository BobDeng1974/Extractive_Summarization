ancient lives : @entity21 , which opens on may 22 , reveals that despite the separation of centuries , the @entity22 suffered from the same health issues that plague us today , including high cholesterol , fatty diets and bad toothache			1
unwrapped : eight mummies from the @entity8 , like the one shown , revealed their secrets after undergoing cat scans one even sported a tattoo of the @entity34 on her inner thigh			1
@entity36 , head curator of the @entity8 's @entity2 and @entity38 department , said : ' we want to promote the idea these are not objects , but real human beings			2
' we want to capture the humanity of these people			0
' the mummies came from all walks of life , from royalty to ordinary people living along the @entity51			2
they also lived during different eras - the oldest tested is more than 5,500 years old and dates back to 3,500 @entity54 , while the most recent lived around 1,300 years ago			0
some were just youngsters when they died , at around two years of age , while others lived to see their 50th birthday			0
using cat scans , also known as computer tomography , scientists were able to build up a three - dimensional picture of the ancient remains			2
some of the bodies were so well preserved that the scan revealed bones , tissue and vital organs			0
scientists combined the @entity13 scan images with carbon dating and infra - red ' reflectography ' to build up a detailed picture of their lives			0
scans of the pelvic areas also helped the team work out their ages by looking at the wear and tear on their bones			0
secrets revealed : @entity13 scans , like the one pictured , showed how the ancient @entity22 lived , what ailments they suffered and their dietary habits two of the eight mummies tested were found to have a build - up in their legs of plaque - essentially cholesterol , calcium and tissue - suggesting they suffered from heart problems			1
this can be caused by a rich diet high in fat , or it can be genetic			2
many experienced poor dental health and had multiple abscesses , which if left untreated , may have led to inflammation of the throat , asphyxiation and ultimately death			2

exhibition curator @entity121 , who also curates the museum 's physical anthropology department , said : ' the tattoo on her right inner thigh represents a monogram that spells @entity34 in ancient @entity127			1
' she is the first evidence of a tattoo from this period			0
this is a very rare find			0
' the tattoo represents the symbol of the @entity34 and one theory suggests it may have provided the owner , who lives in ad 700 , with spiritual ' protection ' .			1
