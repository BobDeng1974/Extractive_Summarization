a new disposable paper cone that helps men to urinate accurately could save ' millions of lives ' , by detecting the early signs of diabetes and prostate cancer			1
the flushable invention is slipped on to the penis to ensure a straight aim while urinating			1
but the device goes further than merely preventing unhygienic splashes in the bathroom			2
the device harbours a number of reagents which react to foreign bodies , including blood and glucose , in urine causing the paper to change colour , alerting men to potentially life - threatening health problems			1
@entity23 is the brainchild of @entity25 inventors @entity26 and @entity27			1
they believe it could also help stop the spread of sexually transmitted infections , as well as cut drink - drive convictions			1
a new disposable paper cone that helps men to urinate accurately could ' save millions of lives ' , by detecting the early signs of diabetes and prostate cancer , its makers claim in the last seven years , the product has evolved from a simple paper cone helping men urinate more accurately , to the flushable diagnostic medical device it is today			1
mr @entity26 told @entity45 : ' with the stigma of a visit to the doctor , along with the saving in the doctor 's valuable time in the earliest stage of diagnosis , this could really be a game - changer for preventative health			2
' a user of the product would be able to see any immediate change in the reagent and then make the call to the gp for further investigation			2
' in developing @entity23 , the company carried out market research in @entity65 , identified as a key market with more than 40 million adult males			2
they found that 84 per cent of those surveyed approved of the product , with 71 per cent confirming they would use the device			2
various reagents - substances used in a chemical reaction to detect or measure other substances - are incorporated into the lower tip of the paper cone			1
they react to irregular levels of foreign matter , including blood , protein and glucose , in the urine allowing @entity23 to signal an early warning for conditions including diabetes and prostate cancer			1
the company behind the invention claim it can also promote penile health			2
they say the paper cone can clean , medicate and dry the penis thanks to a hypo - allergenic antibacterial agent it contains			1
a spokesman said : ' gynaecologists have recommended regular use of the product since @entity103 's sanitising action can help to stop the spread of sexually transmitted infections including chlamydia , herpes , and genital warts			1
@entity23 is a flushable cone that is slipped on to the penis to ensure a straight aim while urinating special substances in the cone react to abnormal levels of sugar , blood and protein in urine changing colour to alert a person to the early signs of illnesses including diabetes and prostate cancer ' it can also prevent the spread of the human papilloma virus ( @entity126 ) that leads to cervical cancer			1
' another key use , the company says , is that the reagent can be one specifically designed to detect alcohol levels			1
it means @entity23 could aid a man 's aim after a couple of pints , while also acting as a means of measuring his blood alcohol level , indicating whether he is over the legal drink - drive limit			1
the spokesman said : ' as well as potentially saving lives , companies that demonstrate a corporate responsibility to staff welfare by installing dispensers will , not only benefit from reduced illness due to early diagnosis and therefore saving thousands in lost productivity , but will also positively impact the finances of health care service providers globally			2
' @entity23 helps men aim accurately minimising any unhygienic splash back or drips , a benefit not just to all ages but also for those with degress of disability , and the obese			1
' accurate urination reduces the hazard of wet floors , cuts cleaning and the need for air fresheners			0
' after a single - use , the @entity23 flushes away and disintegrates so is environmentally friendly			1
' wives , mothers , partners and cleaning contractors around the world will applaud this apparently simple invention			0
' the disposable cones stack easily inside one another and are intended to be sold for domestic use in packs of 28 , with dispensers also available			0
the company say their innovative product is inexpensive , equating to just pennies per use , ' a small price to pay for daily health checks '			0
and there are plans for flat - packed versions , suitable for those in the armed forces , sportsmen , travellers and commuters			0
the company are currently in the process of finalising development of the product in order to bring it to market			0
men suffering prostate problems can urinate faster and more effectively by sitting down rather than standing up , a new study has found			0
for those suffering conditions including lower urinary tract symptoms ( @entity200 ) , sitting down will allow them to urinate faster , with greater force , while leaving less urine behind in their bladder			0
a team of scientists at the @entity208 in the @entity209 sought to investigate the benefits of men sitting down while urinating compared to standing			0
a new study published in the journal @entity213 found men suffering prostate problems can urinate faster and more effectively by sitting down rather than standing they searched 14 medical databases , selecting 11 viable studies from 96 different studies from 2,352 publications			0
the researchers said : ' we found that in patients with @entity200 the sitting position is associated with a trend towards a more favourable urodynamic profile			0
' their findings confirmed men with @entity200 who sat down while urinating did so faster , for longer , with greater pressure and released more urine than those with @entity200 who stood			0
the team suggest one reason sitting is more effective , is due to the fact typical @entity200 patients are elderly males who are prone to fall			0
' it is suggested that the fear of falling while standing can result in involuntary contractions of the pelvic muscles to stablise one 's position , ' the researchers said			0
' contraction of the pelvic muscles is related to disturbed urinary flow			0
' the study was published in the @entity213 journal .			0

manufacturers claim the single - use product will save millions of lives
@entity23 is a flushable paper cone that is slipped on to the penis
