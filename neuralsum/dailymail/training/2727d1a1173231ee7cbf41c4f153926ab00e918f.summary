train passengers in @entity1 could cut their fares by more than 60 per cent - by buying their tickets a few miles over the border in @entity5			1
a study has found that @entity1 commuters are shelling out more than those in @entity5 because of subsides on @entity5 rail travel - funded by the taxpayer			2
the survey has found that people travelling from @entity14 - 20 miles from the @entity5 border - are paying over £ 50 more for journeys to major @entity18 cities such as @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21			1
it comes as figures from the @entity32 reveal huge disparities between the government funding for passenger journeys , varying from an average of £ 2.19 per journey in @entity1 to £ 9.33 in @entity5			1
consequently @entity5 provider @entity38 would be able to claim 13.07 pence per kilometre travelled by passengers from the taxpayer , on top of the fares passengers have already paid to travel			0
@entity1 train providers , like @entity45 and @entity46 , receive far less , with @entity46 receiving 1p per passenger kilometre in @entity1			0
as a proportion of total income in the last financial year , @entity5 received 56 per cent in subsidies , compared with 27 per cent in @entity1			2
a trip to @entity19 during morning rush hour on monday next week will cost £ 80.70 from @entity53 , according to the research by the @entity56 newspaper			1
but in @entity27 , peak time tickets to major cities are up to £ 58.60 cheaper than those bought in @entity14 but a train leaving @entity27 just four minutes later travelling to the same destination will cost less than half the price - only £ 32			1
a four - hour journey from @entity14 to @entity21 will cost £ 92.60 , but a train leaving 10 minutes earlier from @entity27 or @entity28 would cost just £ 34 - a saving of £ 58.60			1
services from @entity28 to @entity19 , @entity67 , @entity20 , @entity68 and @entity69 also proved cheaper than travelling from @entity14 , but with just minutes added to the journey			2
tickets from @entity14 to @entity27 are £ 11.20 while fares from @entity14 to @entity28 are £ 12.40 , @entity72 , a director of travel watch @entity73 , said difference in ticket price is a legacy of the system used by nationalised operator @entity79 , which was privatised during the 1990s			1
he said : ' the history of @entity79 helps us understand how fares are priced			0
' before the railway was privatised , lines used to be classified in three categories ; intercity fares , @entity87 fares , which covered a lot of lines to and from @entity90 , and regional railway fares			0
' traditionally regional lines would charge less , as those journeys would contain more stops and take slightly longer			0
' something like @entity14 to @entity19 would be classed as an intercity line , whereas something leaving from @entity27 and travelling through @entity5 is likely to be a regional line and would cost less			1
' lines , or flows , are still considered when setting ticket prices			2
' market demand as well as the rail provider , reliability , choice and comfort affect the cost of tickets , according to mr @entity72			0
he said : ' there are also many other factors that contribute to how rail tickets are priced and it has a lot to do with the service provider			0
' for example bigger service providers often offer more flexibility in their tickets and can be more luxurious , which means they cost more			0
' you also pay for market demand			0
i expect these routes from @entity27 and @entity28 are less popular than from @entity14			2

there are huge disparities between tickets bought in @entity14 and @entity27
government subsidies for @entity5 and @entity1 passengers also vary hugely
people travelling from @entity14 paying £ 50 more for journeys to major cities
but in @entity5 , the same destinations are up to £ 58.60 cheaper
