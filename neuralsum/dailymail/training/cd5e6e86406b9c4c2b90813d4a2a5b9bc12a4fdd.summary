@entity0 is placing a ban on the number of @entity4 citizens - including @entity5 - who can work in the country as public anger grows over mass immigration			1
from next week the @entity10 state will implement quotas on work permits for jobseekers from the @entity4			0
the limits will be in place for the next 12 months			0
the @entity0 government fears being ' swamped ' by economic refugees from @entity18 and @entity19 when work rules are eased next year			1
but it can not discriminate against only a few countries out of a bloc of 27 with 500million citizens so the restrictions will affect everyone			0
the @entity0 parliament has decided to restrict access to work in the country to people from @entity4 member states ' in the coming 12 months , workers from @entity4 states will have only restricted access to the @entity0 labour market , ' the @entity33 said in a statement			1
the move by @entity0 comes ahead of a significant change to the rights of @entity19 and @entity18 to work			1
@entity19 and @entity18 are among the poorest countries in @entity44 and when they joined the @entity4 in 2007 work restrictions were imposed amid fears about mass migration			1
these measures will be dropped on 1 january 2014 giving @entity18 and @entity19 the same rights to work across the union as other @entity4 citizens			1
from january 1 next year , the 25,000 cap on the number of low - skilled workers from the two countries who can get jobs and claim benefits in @entity5 will expire			0
the move by @entity0 to limit @entity4 citizens from working comes ahead of a change to the number of @entity19 and @entity18 who can come to the @entity5			1
@entity4 - wide work restrictions were imposed on the two countries when they joined the union in 2007			0
there were fears that mass immigration would swamp other @entity4 countries as people left their home countries - among the poorest in @entity44 - to seek work elsewhere			2
from january 1 next year , the restrictions are lifted			0
in the @entity5 , this means the 25,000 cap on the number of low - skilled workers from the two countries who can get jobs and claim benefits here will expire			0
the minimum wage in @entity18 is only 73p while it stands at 79p in @entity19			1
in @entity5 the minimum wage is £ 6.19 , rising to £ 6.31 from october			0
there are about 130,000 @entity19 and @entity18 living in the @entity5			1
current rules mean they are only allowed to work here if they are self - employed , investors , or if they take on short - term contracts for jobs such as fruit picking			0
@entity0 's move will increase pressure for other nations to follow suit			2
but local media have called the decision a ' pulling up the drawbridge ' mentality and came after pressure from right - wing parties , despite pleas by the influential @entity0 financial sector that more immigrants are needed to keep the economy strong			2
in recent years the subject of immigration has become ever more controversial			2
right - wing parties have routinely played on @entity0 fears of ' the other ' and issued posters like one which showed a black sheep being kicked out of a field full of white ones			1
the far - right @entity110 in particular has spiked in popularity with claims that foreigners take jobs away from @entity0 citizens			1
but in reality it is immigration from only a few states - @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 and now @entity19 and @entity18 - that irritates the most			1
southern @entity44 people have been flocking to @entity0 in recent times as the endless financial crisis continues to sap them of jobs and hope			2
the clause that @entity0 is invoking is part of a bilateral agreement on migration with the @entity4 and allows temporary quotas on residency permits for @entity4 residents wishing to work in @entity0			2
@entity0 will now apply to the entire @entity4 limits already in place for people from @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 and the @entity145			0
' despite the move the @entity4 is and will remain our most important partner , ' said justice minister @entity149			0
a government spokesman said that the million - plus @entity4 residents who live in the country have ' had a positive impact ... in particular in terms of consumer spending and on the construction industry , ' but that restrictions are ' needed to make immigration more acceptable to society			0
' the move drew immediate criticism from @entity163			0
'' the measures disregard the great benefits that the free movement of persons brings to the citizens of both @entity0 and the @entity4 , ' said @entity169 , @entity4 foreign policy chief			1
others worry that the @entity0 move is a new manifestation of intolerance in @entity44 .			0

@entity176 immigration has become more controversial in @entity0
quota affects all citizens , despite fears over @entity19 and @entity18 influx
