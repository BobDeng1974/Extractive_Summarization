@entity1 ’s position is made easier by the fact that none of his potential rivals has declared their hand			1
many mps want @entity7 , the popular former postman , to throw his hat into the ring – saying he has much greater appeal with voters than the awkward mr @entity1			1
but mr @entity7 , who served as home secretary under @entity13 , has all but ruled himself out , claiming last month that he had ‘ no appetite for being on the frontbench ’			1
it seems the succession would come down to a face - off between shadow home secretary @entity20 and @entity18 , the shadow health secretary			1
the bookies are increasingly throwing their weight behind mr @entity18 , who made a well - received speech on the @entity31 at september ’s @entity33 conference – in marked contrast to mr @entity1 ’s famously poor effort			1
it is reported that , emboldened by his conference success , he is already canvassing support ; particularly in the @entity39			0
@entity40 yesterday cut mr @entity18 ’s chances of leading the party from 6/1 into 4/1 to be the next party leader , as more and more political punters back him			1
the former health secretary has also gained the support of militant union leader @entity47 who said last month mr @entity18 is the person who ‘ most impresses ’ him on the @entity33 frontbench			1
however , miss @entity20 is still favourite to take over if mr @entity1 goes ; attracting odds of 7/2			2
she can at least count on the support of her husband , shadow chancellor @entity54 , who is unlikely to have much chance of victory on his own			0
popular : former postman @entity7 mr @entity7 is further down the betting pecking order on 12/1			2
if none of these decide to stand , it could be left to younger frontbenchers such as @entity62 ( 8/1 ) , with @entity63 and @entity64 outside bets on 16/1			0
the man who labour mps and party members wanted to be leader – @entity70 – has odds of 20/1			2
but there is no chance of him taking the reins from his brother because he has stepped down as an mp and moved to the @entity78			0
... but the rules mean that it 's impossible party rules say that to force out the leader , a vote of no - confidence has to be called – and the only way for that to happen is a card vote at the party ’s annual conference			1
no such move was made at the last @entity33 conference six weeks ago in @entity90 and none is scheduled before may ’s election			0
so it seems that those dissatisfied with @entity1 ’s leadership have missed their chance to force him out			2
their only hope is that the pressure becomes so intolerable that he decides to step down for the good of the party			0
this could happen if , for example , a large number of mps say publicly they want him to go			0
in that case , other candidates would be able to put themselves forward			0
to become a candidate , an mp needs the support of 15 per cent of the parliamentary party – or 39 of @entity33 ’s current 257 mps			0
the voting rules in a leadership contest were changed in march to a one member , one vote system for mps , meps , party members and affiliated union members .			2

none of @entity1 's potential rivals have declared their hand
many mps want @entity7 , who served as home secretary under @entity13
but mr @entity7 has claimed that he has ' no appetite for the frontbench '
seems next in line would be either @entity18 or @entity20
party rules mean that @entity1 ca *n't* be forced out as leader before election
