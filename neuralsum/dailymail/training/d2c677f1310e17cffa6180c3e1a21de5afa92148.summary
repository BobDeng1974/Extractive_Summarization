a company that operates at least 13 wind - energy facilities across three states is suing in federal court to block the @entity5 government from releasing information to @entity7 about how many birds are found dead at its facilities			1
@entity11 of @entity12 , @entity13 , is seeking an injunction in @entity15 in @entity16 to prevent the @entity17 from releasing information it considers confidential			1
the @entity20 administration has said it planned to turn over the material to @entity7 , which sought it from the @entity17 in march 2013 under the @entity5 @entity23			2
the government concluded that the industry 's concerns were ' insufficiently convincing ' to keep the files secret			0
no accounting : dozens of eagles have been found dead at wind farms in @entity32 alone			1
now @entity11 , a major wind farm company , is working to keep the exact death toll secret the information the @entity7 sought was part of its larger investigation into bird and eagle deaths at wind farms and the administration 's reluctance to prosecute the cases as it advocated the pollution - free energy source			1
the @entity7 asked the @entity46 for data collected under federal permits given to companies to collect the carcasses of protected bird species , including eagles and migratory birds , found dead at their facilities			2
using documents , emails and interviews with former wildlife officials , the @entity7 in articles published last year documented more than four dozen eagle deaths in @entity32 since 2009 , and dozens more in @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity13 , @entity63 and @entity64			1
corporate surveys submitted to the federal government and obtained by @entity7 showed at least 20 eagles found dead in recent years on @entity11 wind farms in @entity32			1
the wind energy industry has said more birds are killed by poisoning and collisions with cars , buildings and electrical wires			0
wind energy companies objected to the @entity7 's efforts to uncover more information about the numbers of bird deaths			0
the companies said the information was confidential , submitted voluntarily and should not be revealed under the government 's open records law			0
wind farm proponents argue that more birds are kill by cars and power lines than die colliding with wind turbines last month , the government informed @entity11 and other companies that within days it intended to release some information to the @entity7 it said the harm the companies cited from the information 's release was ' too general ' and ' insufficiently convincing ' to prevent its release			1
the lawsuit , filed october 17 , said the disclosure will cause ' irreparable harm ' to @entity11 , which is owned by @entity101			0
in the complaint , the company said withholding the information is in the public 's interest because it will ensure ' open communication ' between such companies and the government			0
a @entity11 lawyer told the @entity7 the company does not comment about pending litigation			0
wind farms are clusters of turbines as tall as 30 - story buildings , with spinning rotors as wide as a passenger jet 's wingspan			2
though the blades appear to move slowly , they can reach speeds up to 170 mph at the tips , creating tornado - like vortexes .			0

@entity125 brought against the @entity5 @entity17 after the @entity126 said it planned to release bird kill records
@entity11 of @entity12 , @entity13 , says the public does not have the right to know how many birds were killed at its wind farms
at least four dozens eagles have died since 2009 in @entity32 alone
dozens more in @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity13 , @entity63 and @entity64
