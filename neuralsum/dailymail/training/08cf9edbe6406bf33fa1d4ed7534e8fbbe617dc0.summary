thousands of female engineers will be trained up as part of a ' national mission ' to get @entity5 building again , @entity0 announced today			1
the @entity7 leader said it was a ' national embarrassment ' that just one in 25 engineers were women			1
he pledged to ensure an extra 400,000 engineers were trained up by 2020 - with a @entity7 source promising a ' significant increase ' in the proportion of women			1
he announced his plan during a visit to the @entity19 construction site in central @entity20 , which he said was an ' inspiring ' project which should encourage the next generation of engineers			0
after another bruising period for his leadership , with the departure of @entity35 from his shadow cabinet following her controversial tweeted image of a house flying three @entity40 flags with a white van parked outside , mr @entity0 sought to shift the focus to his plans to rebalance the economy			1
after donning a hard hat and high - visibility safety gear for a tour of the works near @entity19 station , the @entity7 leader said : ' i think this is an inspiring place to be			1
' our country faces a shortage of 400,000 skilled engineers if we do n't act			2
that 's why it 's the mission of the next @entity7 government to put that right			2
' it 's the way we will create good jobs at decent wages and it 's also the way that we are going to create a recovery that does n't just work for a few people at the top but actually works for working people			0
' mr @entity0 said @entity5 was facing a shortfall of some 400,000 engineers by 2020 if there was not a major recruitment drive the @entity7 leader said the government had failed to act to ' get the skilled engineers we need ' to stop @entity5 industry being reliant on foreign workers mr @entity0 acknowledged that the problem had existed for a number of years			1
' over a long period we have n't taken the action necessary to get the skilled engineers we need , ' he said			0
' that 's about inspiring our young people in schools and colleges and creating new gold - standard technical qualifications for them in engineering			0
' and it 's about apprenticeships for the next generation			0
it 's about saying to companies ' if you want a major government contract you must provide apprenticeships , if you bring in a skilled worker from outside the @entity94 you must also provide apprenticeships for the next generation '			0
' it 's that kind of national mission , of government and business together , that will create the skilled jobs and the skilled engineers we need			2
' writing on @entity103 he said there was a choice between ' two different directions ' for the country			0
one was through the creation of skilled workers , such as those working on the major transport project in @entity20 , while the other involved ' cowboy recruitment agencies , operating in the shadows of the economy , exploiting workers , undercutting wages and undermining conditions '			0
he said : ' only a @entity7 government will have the values , approach and ideas to turn the economy we have with low wage , low - skilled jobs into the economy we need , with high - skilled , high wage jobs			2
' mr @entity0 's pledge to boost female engineering comes after another tough week following the sacking of @entity7 mp @entity35 mr @entity0 said the @entity5 had to 're - establish our historic reputation as a world leader in technology and manufacturing '			1
@entity7 said industry estimates were that an extra 780,000 more engineers would be needed between now and 2020 , but current projections were for only around half of that number to be trained , leaving a shortfall of some 400,000			1
mr @entity0 said : ' this is not just a shortage of the traditional civil , mechanical and electrical engineers , but also in information technology , green energy , and life sciences where many of the jobs of the future will be created			1
' and we need to ensure @entity5 does not waste the talents of any our young people , be they men or women			1
' it should be matter of national embarrassment that the @entity5 has the lowest proportion of female engineering professionals of anywhere in @entity160			1
' in 2013 , just 14 % of engineering graduates were women , and females made up only 4 % of all professionally - registered engineers			2
mr @entity0 said : ' we will work with schools to ensure more young people , girls as well as boys , do stem subjects - science , @entity170 - to nurture this new generation			1
' we will work with young people themselves , encouraging and inspiring them at every stage , with a clear vocational route through education into an engineering career that is desperately needed now			0
' and we will work with industry to put employers in charge of the money for training young people so that as many school - leavers go into a high quality apprenticeship as currently go to university			0
' this is the kind of future we can build together , doubling the rate of engineers being trained here by 2020 rather than importing them from abroad or leaving businesses without the skills they need to succeed			0
' as well as encouraging engineers , mr @entity0 said @entity7 would not tolerate a ' world of work that is becoming more brutal because of the way some rogue employment agencies have been allowed to operate '			1
he said : ' we will close the legal loophole which allows some to undercut the wages of permanent staff			0
' we will stop them from recruiting exclusively from abroad			0
' and we will serve notice on the rogue agencies that they must clean up their act			0
' he said @entity7 consult on measures including a licensing system to ensure agencies comply with basic standards			2

@entity7 leader said number of women engineers a ' national embarrassment '
mr @entity0 said just one in 25 engineers in the @entity5 were women
he promised to train up an extra 400,000 engineers over the next five years
