' as judges of the facts , your duty , pooling your common sense and experience of life , is to assess the witnesses and the other evidence that is put before you in the trial , and in due course to decide the relevant facts and thereby , having applied my directions of law , to reach a verdict according to the evidence			0
' a number of duties follow from your role as judges of the facts			0
it 's your duty to try the case on the evidence			0
the evidence is the evidence that you hear in this courtroom and nothing else			0
' he said jurors have duties , including not allowing themselves to be influenced ' by any external matter ' , including media coverage			0
they should not discuss the case with anyone else , should not post entries on social networking sites about the trial , and should not try to research the case themselves			0
@entity4 is accused of 12 counts of indecent assault on four alleged victims , the youngest of whom was seven or eight and the oldest 19 , between 1968 and 1986 , which he denies			1

mr @entity45 told the three extra jurors that they will sit in court for the beginning of the trial in case any issues arise with the 12 who were sworn in			1
he said : ' sometimes in a case of some size , like this one , during the course of the prosecution opening of the case when the detail is gone through more with the jury , a juror can sometimes realise that they know someone who is mentioned or that something else has arisen that really means they should not be sitting on the jury			0
' because it is so strongly preferable that the trial should have 12 jurors rather than any lesser number , that almost inevitably means that the whole jury has to be discharged before the whole thing starts again			2
if you do not have spare jurors ... that would mean that you would need to go through the whole process that you 've gone through over the past few days again ; obviously that would be an unfortunate waste of time and money			0
the spare jurors are here in case that happens			0
' the jurors were sent away until tomorrow , when it is expected that the prosecution case will open			0
