one of the secrets of migraines has been unlocked by a scientist who resolved to find a cure for the condition when it struck her down as a child			1
@entity6 has discovered a gene that could lead to new and better treatments for the unpredictable and pounding headaches that blight the lives of millions			1
as a teenager , she had her schoolwork and athletics training disrupted by migraines			2
now a 36 - year - old professor of chemistry , she said : ‘ i had migraines really frequently and severely			1
i would lose my vision , vomit uncontrollably – it would wipe out an entire day			0
professor @entity6 , of @entity17 in @entity18 , vowed to find a cure for migraines when she was affected by it as a child ‘ i decided then as a high school student that i was going to work on migraines , that i was going to figure them out and help find a cure			1
’ professor @entity26 , of @entity17 in @entity18 , is part of a team of @entity30 scientists who have found the first gene involved in typical migraines			1
the scientists first studied the genetics of two families of migraine sufferers			0
this allowed them to pinpoint a common genetic flaw			2
to check that the gene is key to migraines , they then studied mice carrying the same genetic fault			1
lead researcher @entity43 , of @entity44 , said : ‘ obviously , we ca n’t measure a headache in a mouse but there are other things that go along with a migraine that we can measure			2
’ experiments showed the mice , like people with migraines , to be extra-sensitive to pain , touch , sound and light			2
scientists have discovered a gene that could unlock the secrets of migraines the mutant mice were also more prone to a pattern of brain waves linked to the flashing lights or other visual problems that can precede a migraine			1
giving the mice migraine drugs seemed to ease some of their symptoms , the journal @entity68 reports			0
working out just how the flaw in a gene called casein kinase i delta causes migraines could lead to improved treatments			1
professor @entity43 said existing drugs ‘ only help some patients , some of the time ’			0
he added : ‘ this is the first gene in which mutations have been shown to cause a very typical form of migraine			0
it ’s our initial glimpse into a black box that we do n’t yet understand			0
‘ as we come to a clearer understanding , we can start to think about better therapies			0
the need for better treatments is huge			0
’ @entity92 , a professor of neurology and medical trustee of the @entity95 in the @entity96 , described the work as an ‘ exciting new development in understanding migraine ’			0
professor @entity99 , a researcher from the @entity44 , @entity100 , said : ‘ there simply has n’t been enough attention paid to migraine as a major cause of disability worldwide			0
compared to other common medical problems relatively little research has been done on the cause of migraine and its potential treatments			0
‘ we desperately need a better understanding of the condition and new treatments so that we are better able to help these many people whose lives are devastated by the disorder			1
’ it is hoped the gene , which is also involved in the control of sleep , will also shed light on links between sleeping too much and too little and the onset of migraines			2
migraines feature in the @entity126 ’s top 20 most disabling lifetime conditions and affect one in four women and one in 12 men .			1

professor @entity6 decided as a child she wanted to find a cure
found that a flaw in a gene called casein kinase i delta that causes migraines
this discovery could lead to new and better treatments for the condition
they affect 1 in 4 women and 1 in 12 men and cost *economy* *£* *2bn* a year
