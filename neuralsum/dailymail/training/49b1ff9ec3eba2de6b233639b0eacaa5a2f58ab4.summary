atheists tend to be more intelligent than religious people , according to a @entity3 study			1
researchers found that those with high iqs had greater self - control and were able to do more for themselves - so did not need the benefits that religion provides			1
they also have better self esteem and built more supportive relationships , the study authors said			0
new evidence : a study has concluded that religious people are less intelligent than non-believers the conclusions were the result of a review of 63 scientific studies about religion and intelligence dating between 1928 and last year			1
in 53 of these there was a ‘ reliable negative relation between intelligence and religiosity ’			0
in just 10 was that relationship positive			0
even among children , the more intelligent a child was the more probable it was that they would shun the church			0
in old age the same trend persisted as well , the research showed			0
the @entity36 psychologists behind the study defined religion as involvement in some or all parts of a belief			2
they defined intelligence as the ‘ ability to reason , plan , solve problems , think abstractly , comprehend complex ideas , learn quickly , and learn from experience ’			0
in their conclusions , they said : ‘ most extant explanations ( of a negative relation ) share one central theme - the premise that religious beliefs are irrational , not anchored in science , not testable and , therefore , unappealing to intelligent people who ‘ know better ’			2
‘ intelligent people typically spend more time in school - a form of self - regulation that may yield long - term benefits			0
‘ more intelligent people getting higher level jobs and better employment and higher salary may lead to higher self - esteem , and encourage personal control beliefs			1
’ study co-author @entity67 , a graduate student of neuroeconomics at the @entity36 , said : ‘ intelligence may lead to greater self - control ability , self - esteem , perceived control over life events , and supportive relationships , obviating some of the benefits that religion sometimes provides			2
’ detailed : the research analysed 63 surveys comparing intelligence levels and religious beliefs between 1928 and 2012 research from the @entity81 last week showed another drawback to being religious , or at least @entity83 - you lose out in the race for top jobs			1
official figures show nearly one in four people who have no religious belief now live in homes headed by someone with a senior executive job or a place in one of the professions			2
but well under a fifth of @entity83 are employed in the best - paid and most influential jobs or are married to someone who is , according to the @entity98 ( @entity98 )			1
the last census , carried out in march 2011 , showed a fall in the number of people that call themselves @entity83 in the @entity81			1
@entity83 numbers in @entity105 and @entity106 , including children , fell by 4.1 million in a decade to 33.2 million			1
however there was a 45 per cent rise over the same 10 years in numbers who say they have no religion , to 14.1 million .			0

@entity80 found those with higher iqs more likely to *dismiss* religion
another drawback to being religious , or at least @entity83 is losing out on top jobs
