reasons to stay alive by @entity2 @entity2 was working in @entity4 with his girlfriend @entity5 when his life suddenly changed			1
at 24 , he was a self - confessed party animal who drank too much , while eating and sleeping too little			1
one day he felt his brain flickering and tingling inside his head and he became overwhelmed by a feeling of intense panic as well as the desire to end his life			2
@entity2 's first - hand account of the brutal sickness is a scintillating read ‘ to escape a mind on fire , where thoughts blaze and smoke like old possessions lost to arson			1
’ he walked to a cliff edge , looked at the @entity24 and thought : ‘ a single step — versus the pain of being alive			0
’ from time to time most people will moan that they feel ‘ depressed ’			2
the word is easy to reach for when feeling vaguely down or perhaps when we ’ve become sad for a very good reason — such as a recent bereavement or the loss of a job			0
or when the stress of work or moving house is so great that you ca n’t sleep — or get up in the morning			0
yet real clinical depression should not be confused with such other faces of gloom			1
in this short , scintillating , first - hand account of depression and how he combated it , novelist @entity2 leaves us in no doubt as to the true , terrifying nature of the beast			1
writing 13 years after suddenly being struck down by ‘ a new claustrophobic and suffering reality ’ , @entity2 provides enough detail about the symptoms of depression to deter anyone from taking the name of this cruel condition in vain			1
sadness is not a sickness — but depression most certainly is			1
suicide kills more people than stomach cancer , cirrhosis of the liver , colon cancer , breast cancer or @entity64 ’s , according to @entity66 figures			1
@entity2 takes this a step further : ‘ as people who kill themselves are , more often than not , depressives , depression is one of the deadliest diseases on the planet			1
‘ it kills more people than most other forms of violence — warfare , terrorism , domestic abuse , assault , gun crime — put together			1
’ again and again he finds fresh ways of letting the reader know exactly how bad depression is : ‘ at its worst you find yourself wishing , desperately , for any other affliction , and physical pain , because the mind is infinite , and its torments — when they happen — can be equally infinite			2
’ one of his most valuable points he makes is that depression can strike down any sort of person			2
@entity2 is highly educated , comes from a very happy background , has devoted parents and was already lucky enough to be in a stable relationship with the wonderful @entity5 that has proved a lifesaver			2
he wants us to understand that ( a ) depression is widespread and ( b ) anyone can be struck down			0
‘ millionaires , people with good hair , happily married people			0
people who exude happiness in their status updates , who seem , from the outside , to have no reason to be miserable			0
’ @entity2 gives plenty of ‘ reasons to stay alive ’			2
he comes up with two brilliantly creative sections , which take the form of a dialogue across time between the depressed @entity2 ‘ then ’ and the recovered ( or perhaps i should say , recovering ) @entity2 ‘ now			2
’ so when the old self asks for a reason to go on living , the new self replies : ‘ on the other side of this there is life			0
l - @entity124 you understand ? and there will be stuff you enjoy			0
’ the point is that someone like me can say things like that , but someone suffering from depression can easily retort : ‘ you do n’t know because you have n’t been there ! ’ when @entity2 focuses on his reasons to stay alive on page 117 , his ten clear points are all the more moving because you know this knowledge is hard won			1
in case depressives think they are alone , he tells them robustly there are millions like them , and even gives a list of 39 famous ones , including @entity147			0
@entity2 ’s story of recovery will encourage anyone who feels miserable , whether they are clinically depressed or not , and offers valuable insights to family and friends , too			1
i love the essential wisdom of this : ‘ you know , before the age of 24 i had n’t known how bad things could feel , but i had n’t realised how good they could feel either			0
it is quite therapeutic to know that pleasure does n’t just help compensate for pain , it can actually grow out of it			0
’ now there is nothing at all original in the suggestion that pain does pass and that you can learn from it			0
but it certainly needs repeating — again and again and again .			0
