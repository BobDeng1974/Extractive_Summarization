owners of the new @entity1 have been left angered as it emerged the phone can bend out of shape simply when stored in a pocket			1
since the new model launched on friday , a small but growing number of @entity1 owners have reported the issue that significantly alters the appearance of the phone			1
the problem , dubbed ' bend gate ' by some on social media sites , is due to the phone 's thin aluminium exterior - but can be solved by ensuring the middle of the phone is not subjected to a large force			1
others took to social media , facetiously thanking @entity30 for the ' flexible display ' on their new gadget it is believed the thinner model , in addition to the use of aluminium metal in its design , causes the phone to deform			1
a video , uploaded to @entity41 by user @entity42 , shows the @entity1 bending using just his fingers			1
it has already been viewed more than 13.8 million times			2
macrumors detailed on tuesday that ' a small but growing number of @entity1 owners have reportedly bent their phones after carrying the devices in their pockets just days after launch '			1
one forum user known as ' hanzoh ' claimed his @entity1 plus was ' slightly bent ' after he drove with the device in his pocket			1
' the 6 @entity57 was about 18 hours in my pocket while sitting mostly , ' @entity56 said			0
' as i lay it on the coffee table and sat down on the couch to relax from the drive , i saw the reflection of the window in the @entity66 slightly distorted			0
' and he said when laid flat , a bend in the phones display can clearly be seen			2
the reason for the bend is due to the @entity1 being made out of aluminium			1
aluminium is a relatively soft metal and is fairly ductile and flexible so , if enough pressure is applied , it will bend and move			1
according to @entity76 , no part of either of the new @entity66 has more than a quarter of an inch ( 0.64cm ) of aluminium in any spot			2
this means that , in areas of the phones that are weakest , it ’s possible it could be susceptible to bending			0
this is noticeable in images , with many of the bends occurring near the volume buttons and the sim card slot			0
these areas have segments of the shell cut out to make room for the buttons and sim card , so there is less aluminium - and they are more likely to bend			1
to stop the phone bending , users need to ensure that they do not put increased pressure on the middle of the phone			0
for example , do not have it sideways in a pocket , as your pocket will push it against your leg , possibly causing bending			0
putting it in your back pocket could also have a similar effect , so storing it in a shirt pocket or bag might be a better option			0
another option would be to make sure you have a case for the phone so that it can maintain its rigidity even when pressure is applied			0
@entity30 's chief executive @entity123 ( pictured ) announced on monday the firm sold over 10 million of its ' bigger than bigger ' models , setting a new three - day sales record			1
it beat the @entity128 and @entity130 's record of 9 million it has been reported that the thinner design of the 5.5 - inch phone and the use of aluminum on the frame will cause the new @entity1 ( pictured ) to bend if pressure is applied @entity56 questioned whether the new 5.5 - inch design was ' too thin '			1

' however this is n't the first time @entity1 frames have warped while the issue is n't unique to @entity30 , @entity152 reports			1
it was further mentioned the thinner design and the use of aluminum on the frame causes the phone to misshape if pressure is applied			1
however , other @entity163 users flagged up the fact that many handsets will bend under a similar amount of pressure			2
app developer ‏ @ drbarnard said : ' it ’s actually impressive that the 6 @entity57 does n’t break			0
seems like that much pressure on any device would do damage			0
' while @entity175 co-editor @ panzer added : ' just an anecdote : i carried around the @entity1 for 5 days in a pocket at @entity180 on rides & coasters and did not bend it			1
' the @entity1 has a 4.7 - inch screen , while the @entity1 has a 5.5 - inch display			1

they also have advanced @entity193 and @entity194 hd cameras , and users in the @entity196 will also be able to use the devices to pay for goods using @entity199			0
