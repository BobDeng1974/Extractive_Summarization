by @entity0 published : 15:48 est , 21 june 2013 updated : 16:14 est , 21 june 2013 one of the country 's most notorious financial scandals came to a protracted legal conclusion today as @entity5 ceo @entity4 was re-sentenced to 14 years			1
@entity4 is already in prison in @entity7 , @entity8 , for his role in the once - mighty energy giant 's collapse but had his sentence reduced by ten years as part of a court - ordered reduction and a separate agreement with prosecutors			1
@entity4 has been in prison since 2006 , when he was sentenced to more than 24 years by @entity19 district judge @entity18			1
former @entity21 ceo @entity4 arrives at the @entity22 in his prison uniform for a re-sentencing hearing in @entity7 , @entity8 but an appeals court vacated his prison term in 2009 , ruling that a sentencing guideline was improperly applied			1
that meant a reduction of as much as nine years			0
however , @entity4 's re-sentencing was delayed for years as he unsuccessfully sought to overturn his convictions , including appealing to the @entity19 @entity32			2
@entity4 declined to make statements during the re-sentencing hearing			0
the @entity35 said that in an effort to resolve a case that 's gone on for more than 10 years , it agreed to an additional reduction of about 20 months as part of a deal to stop @entity4 from filing any more appeals			2
federal prosecutors say the deal will allow for the distribution of $ 41.8 million of @entity4 's assets in restitution to victims of @entity21 's 2001 collapse			1
even with the reduced sentence , @entity4 's prison term is still the longest of those involved in the @entity21 scandal			1
@entity4 ( right ) has been in prison since 2006 in @entity7 , @entity8 , when he was sentenced to more than 24 years by @entity19 district judge @entity18 ( pictured at @entity22 for a re-sentencing hearing ) he was the highest - ranking executive to be punished			1
@entity21 founder @entity57 's similar convictions were vacated after he died of heart disease less than two months after his trial			0
@entity4 , 59 , was convicted in 2006 on 19 counts of conspiracy , securities fraud , insider trading and lying to auditors for his role in the downfall of @entity7 - based @entity21			2
the company , once the seventh - largest in the @entity19 , went bankrupt under the weight of years of illicit business deals and accounting tricks			0
a one - time visionary , @entity4 was vilified by many former @entity21 employees for denying any wrongdoing			0
former @entity21 worker @entity74 , the only victim who spoke at the re-sentencing hearing , said employees gave their hard work , spirit and trust to @entity4 and others at @entity21			0
' @entity4 betrayed that trust to those employees and played a part in the financial collapse of an amazing company , ' @entity74 said			0
@entity4 pictured in 2006 , when he was sentenced to 24 years in prison in @entity7 , @entity8 , for 19 counts of conspiracy , securities fraud , insider trading and lying to auditors for his role in the downfall of @entity21 the @entity19 @entity32 said in 2010 that one of @entity4 's convictions was flawed when it sharply curtailed the use of the ' honest services ' fraud law - a short addendum to the federal mail and wire fraud statute that makes it illegal to scheme to deprive investors of ' the intangible right to honest services			1
' the high court ruled that prosecutors can use the law only in cases where evidence shows the defendant accepted bribes or kickbacks , and because @entity4 's misconduct entailed no such things , he did not conspire to commit honest services fraud			2
the @entity32 told a lower court to decide whether he deserved a new trial ; the lower court said no. @entity21 's collapse put more than 5,000 people out of work , wiped out more than $ 2 billion in employee pensions and rendered worthless $ 60 billion in @entity21 stock			0
its aftershocks were felt across the city and the @entity19 energy industry .			0

@entity4 has been in prison in @entity7 , @entity8 , since 2006 and was sentenced to 24 years
today he was re-sentenced to 14 years as part of an agreement with prosecutors - which could see him out in 2017
even with the reduced sentence , @entity4 's prison term is still the longest of those involved in the @entity21 scandal
