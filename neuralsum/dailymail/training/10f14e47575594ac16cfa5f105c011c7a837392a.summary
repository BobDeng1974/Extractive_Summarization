by @entity0 published : 06:23 est , 26 november 2013 updated : 06:24 est , 26 november 2013 a council that spent £ 26,000 pounds on concrete flower pots plans to remove them after drunk locals used them as urinals and ash trays			1
@entity7 is being forced to re-think its decision to put the seven planters in the pedestrianised zone in @entity11 , @entity12 , in light of the anti-social behavior			1
but local residents who branded them a ' waste of money ' that should never have been put in place are happy to see the flower pots go			1
the flower pots on @entity23 cost the council £ 26,000 but have been used by drunk revellers as urinals and ash trays @entity27 , whose anti-pedestrianisation petition attracted 1,400 signatures , said : ' the concrete planters are being used as a receptacle for cigarette ends and are being used by people to go to the toilet and be sick in			1
' the council could have put trees there instead and that would have given the place a nicer feel			0
' we are having to close things down and reduce services in the city , yet money can be thrown away like this all because the council did n’t think to do its homework			2
' if it had , it would have realised putting planters in there would have been a terrible error			2
' another resident complained that the council 's latest proposals are having a negative effect on local business			0
@entity58 , owner of @entity60 clothes shop said : ' i want the high street opened up			0
' the planters could be replaced with some parking spaces			0
local business owners would be happy to see the flower pots go , with some suggesting they should be replaced with trees or parking spaces the road used to be buzzing but it ’s now a ghost town			1
' the removal of the plant pots comes after £ 9,000 was spent building bollards on a nearby road to stop lorries from using it			1
but , three months later , the bungling council was forced to tear them down when the local fire service warned their engines could not get past			2
@entity84 mp , @entity83 says it was more important that the council got things right , adding any plans for the flower pots to be used to improve another road in the city should be reconsidered			1
' it seems we have to rethink the whole idea of what we are going to do			0
' if we have done something and we genuinely appreciate that it ’s a mistake , that problems are being caused , and the quality of the setting is being affected , then the best way forward would be to take the planters out			0
' people thought the planters would improve @entity23 , but they have turned out to be a focal point for problems			0
' we have to make sure the same mistake is n’t made in @entity107			0
