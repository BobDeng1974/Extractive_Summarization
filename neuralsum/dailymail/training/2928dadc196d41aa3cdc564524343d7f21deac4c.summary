created : 09:14 est , 26 april 2014 should university students studying literature or other texts be forewarned of content and themes that could be distressing , such as racism , rape or war ? it seemed like a modest proposal , or so thought @entity10 , a literature major at the @entity11 , @entity11 : what if professors were prodded to give students a written or oral heads - up before covering graphic material that could cause flashbacks in those who had been sexually assaulted , survived war or suffered other traumas ? the idea proved popular with @entity10 's classmates			1
student government leaders at @entity11 endorsed it			0
faculty at other schools , editorial writers and online pundits had a different reaction , calling it ' silly , ' ' antithetical to college life ' and reflective of ' a wider cultural hypersensitivity to harm			1
' warning : @entity10 of the @entity11 believes students should be warned of material that could be traumatic to some students ' what i have heard from a lot of people who do n't fully understand the issue is , " life is life			1
you are going to get your feelings hurt and you should just suck it up and meet it head - on , " ' @entity10 , 19 , said			0
' but a girl just raped a month ago and sitting in a classroom for the first time again is n't ready to face that head - on			0
' @entity10 told the @entity49 that the idea came to her in february after a professor showed a film depicting rape in class with no warning			1
despite having endured sexual abuse in the past , @entity10 was not traumatized by the film but believes students deserve fair warning of such material			1
the uproar over her ' resolution to @entity62 for @entity63 in @entity64 ' has called public attention to the use on college campuses of ' trigger warnings , ' a grassroots phenomenon that had spread quietly from the internet to the @entity71			1
this year , the @entity72 , @entity73 in @entity74 , @entity75 in @entity76 , @entity77 in @entity78 , @entity79 in @entity80 and @entity81 in @entity82 all have fielded requests from students seeking more thoughtful treatment of potentially troubling readings , films , lectures and works of art. in a column called @entity93 in @entity94 , @entity77 student @entity91 cited texts including @entity97 's @entity96 , @entity99 's @entity98 and @entity100 's this is how you lose her as material containing , variously , controlling relationships , gory violence and suicidal themes that could be trauma triggers for people who have ever experienced such things			1
trigger warnings are advisories often written in bold type and affixed to a post , tweet , @entity116 video or increasingly , a class syllabus			1
long a feature of feminist web sites and originally used to warn rape and abuse survivors , they are designed to give people who might be negatively affected a chance to opt out			0
domestic abuse : a @entity77 student says books like @entity100 's @entity126 should have trigger warnings , so that victims of controlling relationships are forewarned the topics students are asking to be cautioned about cover a broad swathe of human suffering			1
at @entity72 , speakers at an @entity137 event on bias said trigger warnings were needed for racially offensive book passages			2
the @entity11 student resolution suggests they are appropriate for portrayals and discussions involving ' rape , sexual assault , abuse , self - injurious behavior , suicide , graphic violence , pornography , kidnapping , and graphic depictions of gore			1
' ' classrooms have always been spaces where difficult , traumatic stuff got dealt with , ' said @entity157 , an associate professor at @entity159 in the @entity160 , @entity161 , and historian of student activism			0
' what 's different now is , partly as a result of this new ethos in the online world of trigger warnings , you are seeing people being willing to assert themselves and say , " my emotional well - being does matter			2
" ' @entity174 , an associate professor at @entity176 's @entity175 , first heard about trigger warnings in the college context five years ago , following a discussion about eating disorders in her @entity182 course			2
to illustrate her points , @entity174 showed pictures of fashion models and images taken from pro-anorexia web sites			0
two students took her to task , telling @entity174 , ' oh , you should have given a trigger warning for people with eating disorders , they ca n't see images like that			0
' while she has colleagues who do provide trigger warnings , @entity174 finds them ' ridiculous ' and refuses to do so			2
' i 'm treating college students like the adults they are , and institutions increasingly treat college students like medicalized children , ' she said			0
filmmaker and writer @entity206 , a rape survivor who teaches at @entity208 in @entity209 , said she is careful to tell students on the first day of class and in her syllabus that ' we are getting ready to delve into some really difficult , painful information here , ' such as sexual violence and police brutality			2
@entity206 also gives them lists of resources for emotional support and has arranged private viewings for students who are afraid to watch a film in class			0
but she worries that trigger warnings , a term she does not use , could stifle free speech , if taken too far			2
' sometimes , i think you can get triggered by trigger warnings , ' she said			2
opposing views : professor @entity174 ( left ) says trigger warnings are ' ridiculous ' while @entity233 ( right ) says she is careful to tell her students when they will be covering difficult material already , the demands have led to head - scratching and in some cases , concerns about censorship			1
in february , after the @entity81 museum installed a life - like sculpture on campus of a man sleepwalking in his underwear , a student started an online petition to have it moved indoors because it had become ' a source of apprehension , fear , and triggering thoughts regarding sexual assault			0
' the same month , @entity91 at @entity77 wrote that professors should employ ' trauma trigger warnings ' as a compromise that would protect both academic freedom and ' individuals suffering from anxiety , post-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive - compulsive disorder - among many others			2
' a task force of faculty , administrators and students charged with updating @entity75 's sexual offense policy included a detailed section on trigger warnings in an online faculty resource guide			1
under the sub-heading ' understand triggers , avoid unnecessary triggers , and provide trigger warnings , ' instructors were advised to be mindful of sexual misconduct , but also ' racism , classism , sexism , heterosexism , cissexism , ableism , and other issues of privilege and oppression			1
' coddled : many have described any measures taken to shield students from difficult and challenging material such as those suggested by @entity10 of the @entity11 is antithetical to academic freeso , political science professor @entity286 was among the @entity75 professors who objected to the guide 's ' imperative voice ' and ' massively long list of - isms , ' worrying they could be lead to discipline or legal action			1
' it would have a very chilling effect on what i say in class and on the syllabus , ' @entity286 said			0
the task force has since removed the disputed section and plans to rewrite it with less ' emphatic - ness , ' said @entity302 , an associate dean who oversaw the committee			0
so far , no schools have required trigger warnings			0
the executive council of the @entity307 at @entity11 issued a statement thursday noting many faculty members ' already use some kind of notification when difficult material will be covered in a course			0
' the council said it would work with students to address their concerns , adding the ' overall goal is to foster a climate of inquiry that allows students to learn , and faculty to teach , as freely and productively as possible			0
