by @entity0 published : 09:47 est , 26 july 2012 updated : 09:47 est , 26 july 2012 a @entity2 drugs company has become further embroiled in a scandal involving the damaging effects of the drug @entity5 , which resulted in thousands of deformed babies around the world			1
it was today claimed that a @entity11 company linked to @entity2 pharmaceutical firm @entity12 covered up the potential birth - deforming effects of @entity5 while continuing to distribute the drug 50 years ago			1
@entity12 purchased a company called @entity17 in 1997 , which had distributed @entity5 in @entity18 on behalf of the @entity11 firm @entity20			1
a @entity11 company linked to @entity2 pharmaceutical firm @entity12 covered up the potential birth - deforming effects of @entity5 while continuing to distribute the drug 50 years ago , it was claimed today			1
last week , @entity12 agreed to pay a multi-million pound settlement to @entity27 woman @entity26 ( pictured ) and it is @entity20 which has now been accused of shocking cover - ups over the effects of the morning sickness drug			1
@entity12 agreed last week to make a multi-million pound settlement to @entity27 woman @entity26 , who was born without arms and legs 50 years ago after her mother took @entity5			1
but what was not revealed until today were allegations that the @entity11 company knew that @entity5 was unsafe , but continued to distribute it			1
according to court files obtained by the @entity40 , @entity11 medical professionals had told @entity20 of their concerns that their patients ’ or own children ’s deformities were caused by women taking @entity5 during pregnancy			2
pregnant women were prescribed @entity5 in the 1950s and 1960s as a treatment for morning sickness or insomnia			2
it was withdrawn from sale in 1961 after babies were born with limb deformities and other damage			0
the drug 's @entity2 manufacturer , @entity56 , paid around £ 28million compensation in the 1970s following a legal battle by the families of those affected			2
in january 2010 , the government finally apologised , expressing its ' sincere regret and deep sympathy ' to the victims of the thalidomide scandal			0
then health minister @entity67 made the formal apology in a statement to mps			0
mr @entity67 also confirmed a £ 20million support package , announced the previous month , which would be administered through the @entity5 to help meet the needs of survivors			0
the papers show that between 1959 and 1961 - while the drug was still being marketed as safe - even employees of @entity20 and their families began having deformed babies			0
one company file shows that eight employee families ‘ had had deformed children ’ between 1959 and 1961			0
the files show that rather than act on the internal warnings , the @entity11 firm told concerned doctors there was no information to suggest the drug was not safe			2
a @entity11 pharmacist , @entity91 , is shown in the files to have written to the company in late 1960 after speaking to a mother who had taken @entity5 during her pregnancy and whose child was born with internal injuries			1
the firm wrote back to mr @entity91 insisting that there was no problem with the drug			0
yet even before mr @entity91 had contacted @entity20 another doctor had been in touch with the firm expressing concerns after his son was born with deformities			0
several files are said to reveal that @entity20 was receiving an increasing number of queries about the drug ’s potential harmful affects on unborn babies , while it was continuing to tell the public it was safe			0

a damages settlement was last reached with pharmaceutical firm @entity12 , but exact details of the pay - out remain confidential eventually , in mid- 1961 , a @entity20 doctor is said to have told a fellow employee that in regard to the drug ‘ significantly more severe injuries than those already known were to be anticipated ' in his opinion			1
another doctor working with the @entity11 company is said to have told a meeting of executives that the firm needed to carry out tests on animals ‘ to determine the possibility of damage to the foetus			1
’ such was the concern of staff in the @entity11 company , it is claimed , that by may 1961 @entity20 knew that its own medically trained staff had ‘ a very real fear of [ thalidomide ] side effects ’ and were refusing to use the drug within their own families			2
@entity146 is understood to be now considering settlements with as many as 130 thalidomide victims in @entity18 and @entity149 – but @entity20 has continued to deny culpability and is defending lawsuits .			0
