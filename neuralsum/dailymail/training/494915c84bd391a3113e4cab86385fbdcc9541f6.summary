by @entity0 published : 14:11 est , 3 september 2012 updated : 14:11 est , 3 september 2012 smoking during pregnancy : could cause problems in brain development of baby women who smoke in pregnancy could be putting their children at greater risk of being fat as teenagers , warn researchers			1
they fear that smoking leads to subtle structural variations in the growing brain of the unborn baby that create a preference for eating fatty foods			1
smoking during pregnancy is already linked to low birthweight and premature delivery of the baby , but evidence is now emerging of the way in which it affects the child 's health in the long - term			1
dr @entity28 , of the @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , who led a new study , said ' prenatal exposure to maternal cigarette smoking is a well - established risk factor for obesity , but the underlying mechanisms are not known			2
' preference for fatty foods , regulated in part by the brain reward system , may contribute to the development of obesity			2
' the research comes as experts predict two out of three children could be obese by 2050 if current trends continue			0
more than one in five is obese at present - so fat it threatens their health			0
the study recruited 378 adolescents age 13 to 19 years of which almost half had mothers who smoked during pregnancy			1
they were carefully matched with the remaining participants whose mothers did n't			0
maternal smoking was defined as having a mother who smoked more than one cigarette a day during the second trimester of pregnancy , while the mothers of the remainder did not smoke one year before or during the pregnancy			1
babies born to women who smoked weighed less at birth and were breastfed for shorter periods of time			1
the researchers found the teenagers whose mothers smoked had a marginally higher body weight and @entity75 ( @entity75 ) , a measure of weight related to height			2
they also had significantly higher total body fat compared with adolescents whose mothers did not smoke in pregnancy			0
the other significant difference was noted by researchers on brain @entity84 found teens whose mothers smoked while they were in the womb had a lower volume of the region called the amygdala , which plays a role in processing emotions and storing memories			2
this part of the brain also appears to have a role in limiting fat intake , and the researchers found that as amygdala volume fell , fat intake went up			0
teenagers may find it harder to resist sweet and fatty foods if their mothers smoked when pregnant with them ( file picture ) ' prenatal exposure to maternal cigarette smoking may promote obesity by enhancing dietary preference for fat , and this effect may be mediated in part through subtle structural variations in the amygdala ' say the researchers in a report published @entity115 in the @entity117 journal			1
latest figures show 13.4 per cent of women smoked in pregnancy in @entity121 last year , down from 15 per cent on 2006 - 07			1
cutting smoking during pregnancy is one of three national aims in the government 's tobacco control plan , published in march last year			1
the aim is to have cut the number of women smoking at the time of giving birth to no more than 11 per cent by the end of 2015			2
dr @entity134 , chairman of the @entity136 's @entity135 , said it was clear that a mother 's dietary and other choices in pregnancy could ' switch on ' bad genes			0
he said ' we 're seeing the results of the new science of epigenetics in which genes can express proteins , or become activated , by what happens in pregnancy			0
' everyone knows that smoking is bad for you , and we 've seen clear evidence of the health risks over the last 50 years			0
' but now there are even more reasons for a pregnant woman to avoid smoking , and press home the message that obesity begins in the womb			0
' you can give your child the best start in life and help them avoid obesity at the same time ' he added .			0

smoking may lead to subtle structural variations in the growing brain of the unborn baby
figures show one in seven women smoked in pregnancy in @entity121 last year
