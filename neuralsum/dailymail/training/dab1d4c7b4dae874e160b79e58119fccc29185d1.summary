by @entity0 published : 07:25 est , 22 april 2013 updated : 07:48 est , 22 april 2013 a leading evolutionary researcher has claimed that sleeping around may have been the secret to the success of modern humans			1
experts have long debated exactly how @entity6 became the ' last human species standing ' among several human ancestors			1
now it is claimed that interbreeding gave humans the advantage			1
@entity14 show @entity13 recreates a homo sapien hunting party : experts have long - debated exactly how @entity17 became the ' last human standing ' among several human ancestors humans ( homo sapiens ) are primates of the family @entity24 , and the only species of the genus @entity26 that still exist			1
humans are characterised by having a large brain relative to body size , with a particularly well developed neocortex , prefrontal cortex and temporal lobes , making them capable of abstract reasoning , language , introspection , problem solving and culture through social learning			2
experts believe @entity6 originated in @entity41 , and fossils show it resembled modern humans about 200,000 years ago , and began to behave like them around 50,000 years ago			1
' as recently as 40,000 years ago , @entity6 lived alongside several kindred forms , including the @entity46 and tiny @entity47 , ' said professor @entity48 of the @entity49 of @entity50 , writing in @entity51			1
' for decades scientists have debated exactly how @entity6 originated and came to be the last human species standing , ' he said			1
one of the key theories emerged from genetic studies in the 1980s , when it was claimed anatomically modern humans arose in @entity41 and spread out across the rest of the @entity59 , completely replacing the existing archaic groups			1
' exactly how this novel form became the last human species on the earth is mysterious , ' said professor @entity48			1
a 2011 study came to the same conclusion , and researchers claim that the first modern humans protected themselves against unfamiliar illnesses by interbreeding with @entity46			1
although it was known that homo sapiens had bred with @entity46 after leaving @entity41 , a study has concluded that in doing so they picked up genes which protected them and eventually helped them to populate the planet			0
' given the complexity of the @entity80 fossil record , which indicates that a variety of transitional human groups , with a mosaic of archaic and modern features , lived over an extensive geographic area from @entity86 to @entity41 between roughly 200,000 and 35,000 years ago , i favor a model that involves interspecies mating during the archaic - to - modern transition , ' professor @entity48 wrote			1
' sometimes called @entity91 , this scenario allows for the possibility that some of the traits that make us anatomically modern were inherited from transitional forms before they went extinct			1
' to my mind , @entity91 , in combination with @entity99 's hybridization model , best explains genetic and fossil data to date			0
' however , professor @entity48 admits more research is needed to prove the theory			0
the researcher hit the headlines earlier this year when a dna test on an @entity107 hoping to trace his family tree came up with a stunning result - the roots of the human tree date back much further than previously thought			1
more that just good friends ? a facial reconstruction of the hobbit human researchers were shocked when they analysed the dna of @entity117 , a recently deceased @entity118 from @entity119			2
' this lineage diverged from previously known y chromosomes about 338,000 years ago , a time when anatomically modern humans had not yet evolved , ' said @entity124 of the @entity125			0
' this pushes back the time the last common y chromosome ancestor lived by almost 70 percent			0
' this time predates the age of the oldest known anatomically modern human fossils			2
the fossil record dates back about 200,000 years , said @entity48			0
either interbreeding with @entity46 or other populations led to the unusual genetic makeup , he said , or humans evolved far earlier than the extant fossil record suggests			2
the new divergent lineage - which was found when mr @entity117 contacted @entity137 , a company specializing in dna analysis to trace family roots - branched from the y chromosome tree before the first appearance of anatomically modern humans in the fossil record			0
a map of human migrations , with the @entity146 at its centre : @entity41 , harboring the start of the migration , is at the top left and @entity151 at the far right			2
dashed lines are hypothetical migrations			0
numbers represent thousand years before present			0
the blue line represents area covered in ice or tundra during the last great ice age			0
the letters are the mitochondrial dna groups used to define genetic populations			2
unlike the other human chromosomes , the majority of the y chromosome does not exchange genetic material with other chromosomes , which makes it simpler to trace ancestral relationships among contemporary lineages			2
if two y chromosomes carry the same mutation , it is because they share a common paternal ancestor at some point in the past			0
the more mutations that differ between two @entity172 the farther back in time the common ancestor lived			0
the results are published in the @entity180			0
originally , mr @entity117 's dna sample was submitted to the @entity182 .			0

leading researcher says interbreeding was key to emergence of @entity6 as *dominant* species
claims early man mated with several ' transitional human groups '
