' but talk to a teacher and they 'll tell you about their working week of 50 hours or more			2
' they 'll also tell you how much of this time they feel is wasted on unnecessary processes , box ticking and form filling			2
' he said too many teachers spend hours ' struggling to stay on top of piles of incident reports , over-detailed lesson plan templates , health and safety forms , departmental updates , training requests and so on that threaten to engulf them every week '			1
he added : ' some of this work is unavoidable			0
every school needs to ensure the safety of its pupils and staff and maintain the highest standards possible			0

' after outlining his plans , mr @entity0 met teachers @entity110 and @entity112 about his plan to cut paperwork in schools shadow education secretary @entity116 said : ' you ca n't trust a word @entity0 says - he is part of the government that has denigrated the professionalism of teachers , allowing unqualified teachers into classrooms , dismissing the profession as ' enemies of promise ' and letting teacher workload spiral			1
