by @entity0 for @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 millions of customers are being targeted by sales - hungry @entity5 staff despite the bank ’s appalling record on mis - selling			1
branches are under increased pressure to sell more insurance policies , loans and investments , secret documents reveal			1
despite racking up a £ 10billion bill for mis - selling payment protection insurance ( @entity20 ) , @entity17 ’s biggest bank has ordered staff to meet increased sales targets or face losing their bonuses – or even their job			1
cut throat : staff at @entity5 , @entity17 's biggest bank , face losing bonuses or their job if they do n't meet targets and the edict was issued months after @entity5 – which was bailed out by the taxpayer in 2008 – was fined £ 28million by watchdogs over its ruthless sales culture and ‘ champagne ’ bonuses			1
the order to ramp up sales led one exasperated employee to post a message on the company ’s intranet asking : ‘ will this bank never learn ? ’ the secret move was revealed by a whistleblower who has lifted the lid on the bank ’s rapacious methods			1
the whistleblower , a senior personal banking adviser at a @entity50 branch of @entity5 , says staff fear for their jobs and are mis - selling insurance and investments just to hit their sales targets			1
to back up his claims , he has handed internal documents to the @entity1 showing the latest targets			2
@entity5 has insisted it has eradicated the sales culture which has blighted so many of its 30million customers			1
but managers raised their targets in march , the documents show			2
they reveal the elaborate points system @entity5 now uses to encourage staff to sell products to customers who walk into a @entity71 branch			1
the system is skewed to encourage the sale of products which are more profitable for the bank but often riskier or more expensive for the customer			2
selling a £ 10,000 loan generates 550 points while selling a junior cash @entity80 generates just 23			2
staff who fail to hit their targets miss out on their bonus – an important incentive to personal banking advisers whose average starting salary is just £ 19,055			1
the whistleblower , who asked not to be identified , said : ‘ the bank pretends they do n’t talk about sales but they do			2
staff are being exploited by the bank and we are all under huge pressure			1
‘ it is difficult to give honest advice to customers			0
there is a clear incentive to lend as much to customers as possible			0
most of us are not trying to get a bonus			2
dishonest ? a whistleblower said it is difficult to give honest advice to customers while keeping a bonus or job ' sometimes people are mis - selling to customers because they do n’t want to be disciplined			1
lots of advisers are on “ red ” , which means they have n’t hit their targets			0
people are afraid of losing their jobs			2
’ the employee came forward after the @entity1 published a leaked internal email last week which revealed the bank is continuing to pressure staff to mis - sell credit cards , loans and insurance			1
in the memo , a regional manager chastised staff for failing to hit targets			0
referring to the number of daily appointments advisers are expected to make , it warns : ‘ i ’ll give you a clue that 1s , 2s and 3s are simply not acceptable			0
’ the email , described by @entity139 as ‘ gratuitous , threatening and menacing ’ , emerged in the same week that the bank ’s bill for mis - selling @entity20 topped £ 10billion – dwarfing the provisions made by its rivals			1
@entity5 insisted the email ‘ is in no way representative of behaviour across the group ’ , adding it had launched an internal investigation and was taking disciplinary action			1
but the internal documents passed to the @entity1 reveal how @entity5 increased its sales targets for staff by more than a quarter in march – three months after the bank was fined £ 28million for promoting a ruthless sales culture			1
@entity152 were handed bonuses for selling customers investments they did not want or need			0
one salesman sold insurance to himself , his wife and a colleague to prevent his salary from being cut			0
comments posted on the company ’s intranet – in response to a weekly blog posted by @entity5 retail boss @entity167 – reveal the bitterness felt by some staff who feel under increased pressure			1
@entity5 branch staff are awarded points for selling a product , such as an insurance policy or a fee - charging bank account			1
they also earn points if they refer a customer to a @entity5 financial adviser who goes on to make a sale			1
each employee is given a quarterly sales target based on a multiple of 1.91 times their salary			0
so a worker earning an annual salary of £ 20,000 will have to generate 38,200 points every three months			0
if they hit their target , they qualify for a bonus			0
@entity5 says employees also have to satisfy a range of other criteria , such as providing good customer service , in order to win bonuses			1
but products that are more profitable for the bank – which tend to be either more risky or more expensive for the customer – will bring in more points towards their sales target			0
so a tax - free cash isa will generate just 45 points			0
but referring a customer to a financial adviser who then sells them a life insurance policy will generate 500 points for the frontline staff member			0
if they refer a customer and it results in a mortgage sale they will get 1,200 points			0
a frontline staff member who simply books an appointment with an investment manager for a customer will also receive 500 points			0
a personal loan will generate 55 points per £ 1,000 borrowed – so the bigger the loan , the more points awarded			0
one employee said : ‘ [ is this ] really the way to motivate staff and prevent mis - selling ? surely when we are supposed to be needs - based selling , the pressure should stop			1
’ another said : ‘ and so it begins again , the pressure to sell to our customers , targets for internet banking , targets for @entity5 , will this bank never learn ! ! ! ! ’ but last night a @entity246 mp said @entity5 ’ staff could not absolve themselves from blame			1
@entity250 a member of the @entity252 said : ‘ @entity254 staff need to be exposed to sanctions for responding to flawed sales incentives			0
' a defence of “ i was only obeying my bonus incentive scheme ” is simply unacceptable			0
sales staff have a crucial role to play in upping standards at banks and they must all be held responsible for bad practice , not just their managers			2
’ @entity5 said it has ditched straightforward sales targets , and said annual bonuses are based on ‘ balanced scorecards ’ , which gauge feedback from customers			2
but it admitted that targets for staff were increased in march			0
it refused to reveal the size of the bonuses available to staff , but said they are based on a percentage of salary			2
a spokesman said : ‘ our key objective is to help our customers manage their money in the best possible way			0
‘ our training , processes and measures are focused on providing excellent service to our valued customers			0
we conduct regular reviews to ensure that customer needs are being appropriately met , but encourage our colleagues to talk to us if they do have any concerns			0

banks under increasing pressure to sell more policies , loans , investments
secret documents reveal @entity5 staff face losing bonus or job if they do n't
it comes after the bank , @entity17 's biggest , racked up £ 10bn @entity20 bill
