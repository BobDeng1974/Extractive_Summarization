by @entity0 published : 19:20 est , 4 december 2012 updated : 19:21 est , 4 december 2012 delighted as she and @entity3 undoubtedly are , the duchess ’s pregnancy could not have come at a more chaotic time for the royal couple			1
the duke is about to make one of the biggest decisions of his life so far – whether to extend his time in the @entity11 or quit to become a full - time working royal			0
and to make matters worse , the couple still wo n’t have a permanent home by the time the baby is born early next summer			0
home - to - be : an aerial view of @entity20			2
a flat in the main building will be home to the couple but not until october 2013 @entity25 and @entity3 ’s planned move to their glitzy new apartment in @entity20 is now unlikely to take place until october 2013			1
contractors refurbishing @entity31 , which used to belong to @entity32 , have uncovered asbestos which has to be cleared before the couple – let alone a newborn baby – can move in			2
sources close to the @entity37 also say the apartment , which has since been used as offices and exhibition space by @entity41 , was ‘ virtually uninhabitable ’ when it was inspected after their wedding last year			0
when the baby is born @entity43 are likely to still be living at @entity45 but hope to move into @entity32 's former apartment as soon as possible contractors refurbishing @entity31 , which used to belong to @entity32 , have uncovered asbestos which has to be cleared before the couple - let alone a newborn baby - can move in palace gardens : the statue of @entity52 sculpted by her daughter @entity53 has recently been spruced up at @entity20 and is looking as good as new it has no kitchen or bathroom and needed total rewiring and plastering , none of which could be started until the apartment was fully vacated by the charity ’s staff just a few weeks ago			1
‘ at the moment there is just no way their new home will be inhabitable by the time the baby is born , ’ said one			0
this means that when they become parents , the couple will still be shuttling between their relatively modest rented farmhouse on @entity75 in @entity76 , and the two - bedroom @entity45 in the grounds of @entity20			1
future parents : having been married for just 20 months , @entity25 is to be a mother early next summer inside the palace : the @entity82 's @entity81 , which has recently been restored as part of a £ 12 million refurbishment the restored formal gardens : the couple currently have two - bedroom @entity45 in the grounds of @entity20 if the duchess ’s health continues to suffer , the couple are also likely to face another major domestic hurdle			1
@entity3 is tied to his base in @entity76 for at least the next nine months			1
but @entity25 is more than likely to be forced to stay nearly 300 miles away in @entity92 – alone – to be closer to her gynaecologist			0
@entity25 ’s natural desire to be close to her mother , @entity95 , may also mean the duchess is more likely to stay in @entity45			2
it is only 50 miles from her parents ’ £ 4.85million home in @entity100 , @entity101			0
and if she stayed in @entity92 , @entity25 would only be a short drive away from the @entity104 hospital where she has been treated since monday .			0

@entity25 and @entity3 's planned move to glitzy new @entity107 in @entity20 now unlikely to take place until october 2013 *due* to asbestos
couple will be shuttling between rented farmhouse on @entity75 in @entity76 and @entity45 in grounds of @entity20
