@entity0 , the @entity1 for @entity2 , has hit back at @entity5 special rapporteur @entity3 , over her claims of a sexist culture in @entity8 do you know in which country women suffer the worst discrimination ? you might guess at one of the @entity16 states where female genital mutilation is common , or perhaps one of the @entity20 nations in which thousands of girls are sold into prostitution			1
you might say @entity23 , where female embryos are disproportionately aborted , or @entity25 , where a woman ’s testimony is worth half a man ’s , or @entity29 , where honour killings are widespread , or @entity31 , where women are forbidden to drive			2
well , you ’d be wrong - wrong , at any rate , according to @entity3			1
the place with the most insidiously sexist culture on the planet , the @entity5 @entity4 assures us , is the @entity8			1
‘ have i seen this level of sexist culture in other countries ? it has n’t been so in - your - face in other countries			1
i have n’t seen that so pervasively in other countries			2
i ’m sure it exists but it was n’t so much and so pervasive			2
’ what form does it take , this pervasive sexism ? according to ms @entity3 , whistling in the street and ‘ sexist images of women ’			1
what kind of person could argue , and apparently believe , that wolf - whistles create a more pervasive sexist atmosphere than , say , forced marriages or the exclusion of girls from school ? who could assert , with evident sincerity , that @entity8 is as bad a place to be female as @entity64 ? why , a @entity5 bureaucrat of course			1
the same sort of bureaucrat as @entity69 , another @entity70 , who last year argued that the @entity72 ’s decision to stop paying housing benefit for unoccupied rooms amounted to an abuse of human rights			2
mrs @entity69 is from @entity77 , where 12 million people live in favelas - squalid shantytowns ringing the major cities			0
does she honestly imagine that those @entity77 would not gladly swap their slums for a @entity8 council house , with or without a spare room subsidy ? @entity5 special rapporteur @entity3 , pictured addressing journalists in central @entity86 april 2014 , caused a storm when she said @entity8 has a ' sexist culture ' then again , the @entity5 has a way of cutting its staff off from reality			1
working in a cloistered international environment , enjoying massive tax - free salaries and perks , convinced that their cause is just , they can slip all too easily into self - righteousness			0
businesses must answer to their customers and their shareholders			0
politicians must answer to their constituents			0
but international civil servants - accountable to no one - are free to concentrate on making themselves comfortable			0
the @entity5 was formed in 1945 with the noble ideal after @entity106 of bringing together 51 member countries to prevent another such conflict			1
based mainly in @entity109 and @entity110 , it now employs tens of thousands of bureaucrats and encompasses 193 states - some run by kleptocrats and dictators - which fund it roughly in proportion to their wealth			1
@entity8 will pay around 5 per cent of its $ 5.5 billion budget this year			1
but , as i said , the @entity5 is not directly accountable to anyone			1
@entity0 has hit out at the tens of thousands of ' bureaucrats ' working at the @entity5 's headquarters in @entity110 and the @entity124			1
pictured is the @entity126 in @entity109 it is hardly surprising that such insulation should , over time , have made it flabby , self - serving and corrupt			0
the @entity5 , in this regard , is no different from the @entity131 , @entity132 or , of course , the @entity134			1
human nature being what it is , international bureaucracies can hardly fail to be both smug and sleazy			0
the @entity5 ’s problem is especially severe because it is thought to embody a lofty ideal			1
as with the mega- charities or the @entity142 , people are reluctant to criticise it			0
we would rather fantasise about an idealised @entity5 - a body that brings nations together , stops wars , promotes human rights - than look at the necessarily grubby organisation that has taken form before us			1
yet it is precisely our indulgent attitude that licenses its corruption			0
and , when i say corruption , i am not talking about sloppy accounting or big expense accounts			0
i am talking about real monstrosities , such as sex - trafficking in former @entity162 by @entity5 personnel who spectacularly failed to do the very thing they were supposedly there to do , namely provide safe havens for civilians			1
according to young prostitutes who ’d been trafficked from poverty - stricken places such as @entity170 and @entity171 , six out of the eight ‘ clients ’ they were forced to sleep with daily were members of the @entity5 ‘ blue berets ’ peacekeeping forces			1
i am talking , too , about the un-run oil - for - food racket which operated in the run - up to the second @entity181 war			0
@entity183 refugees carrying water containers make their way back to their huts at the @entity187 in @entity188 , near the @entity183 border , in may 1994			0
conservative mep @entity0 has accused the @entity5 of ' mindboggling incompetence ' ahead of the mass genocide that later occurred in @entity183 in theory , it allowed @entity193 to sell oil and buy basic supplies for his sanctions - ravaged people with the revenue			1
in practice , @entity5 contractors and @entity193 ’s party officials pocketed millions from kickbacks while ordinary @entity181 suffered terrible privation			1
i am talking about the mind - boggling incompetence of the order issued in 1994 to the commander of the peacekeeping force in @entity183 who had stumbled upon arms caches , and who intended to seize them before they could be used to murder civilians			0
he was told in no uncertain terms to leave the weapons where they were			0
eight hundred thousand people died in the ensuing genocide			0
and i am talking about @entity5 officials selling arms to @entity224 militias while at the same time , it is reliably reported , poaching elephants and trading in their tusks			1
we do n’t like to dwell on such failures			0
we push them from our minds , because we want to give the @entity5 the benefit of the doubt			1
yet it is this thinking that encourages the wrongdoing in the first place			0
how can we take seriously an organisation whose members voted onto its @entity240 for human rights such shameless human rights - abusing countries only in the @entity124 , which is especially touchy about its sovereignty and resents interference from the @entity5 , is the body ’s malpractice widely reported			1
elsewhere , we tend to treat the organisation as the source of ultimate moral sanction			0
which is , if you think about it , a very odd thing to do			0
how can we take seriously an organisation whose members voted onto its @entity240 for @entity241 such shameless human rights - abusing countries as @entity257 and @entity259 ’s @entity258 ? why should a vote by the @entity263 — in which each member state has its say — mean more than a vote in our own @entity266 ? why should we be influenced by how @entity267 , @entity268 and @entity269 cast their ballots ? yet , bizarrely , we are			2
every proposed military action — in @entity181 , in @entity273 , in @entity274 — is now debated largely in terms of whether it has @entity5 authority			2
what do we mean by ‘ @entity5 authority ’ ? we mean , in practice , how @entity280 , @entity23 and @entity281 vote on the @entity126			2
we are , in other words , contracting out our foreign policy to @entity284 , @entity285 and @entity286 @entity0 claims @entity8 is ' contracting out ' our foreign policy to the likes of @entity281 president @entity286 , pictured , and @entity280 president @entity284 every time war looms , you can be certain that @entity291 bishops will assure us that those three atheists are the final arbiters of whether it is just			1
it ’s not that @entity5 employees are more venal than anyone else			2
man is fallen and , in every organisation , you will find people who give in to temptation			0
it ’s simply that , like other global technocracies , the @entity5 does n’t have to explain itself to anyone			2
it is powered by its own sense of moral superiority ; and the rest of us overlook its peccadilloes on the grounds that it means well			0
what would i do to reform it ? i ’d pare back the @entity5 to its most elemental role , namely providing a forum for the arbitration of disputes among states			2
i ’d scrap — or at least pull out of — the massive associated bureaucracies that lay down the law on every subject from the status of refugees to employment rights , from development aid to drugs , from housing to climate change			2
not because these matters are unimportant , but precisely because they are too important to be left to remote officials			0
our ancestors fought for centuries to establish the right to hire and fire their lawmakers			0
yet , at global as at @entity336 level , we seem content to hand power to technocrats who answer only to themselves			2
ms @entity3 is , of course , entitled to her view about @entity8 sexism , as is mrs @entity69 to hers about our housing benefit			1
but if they want to dictate policy , they should take the trouble to get themselves elected first .			0
