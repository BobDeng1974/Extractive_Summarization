@entity1 's development of @entity2 at @entity3 helped to convince fellow left - back @entity5 to join the @entity6 when he made the move to @entity8 this summer			1
an impressive 18 - month spell at the @entity3 helm persuaded @entity8 that @entity1 was the right man to take the reins at @entity12			1
pochettino last season led @entity3 to their best ever @entity15 campaign , playing an attractive , high - pressing game with a team full of @entity19 talent whose talents he helped hone			1
new man : left - back @entity5 ( left ) moved to @entity8 from @entity24 this summer inspiration : @entity1 's move to @entity8 convinced @entity5 to follow him there the likes of @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity2 have moved on to pastures new as a result , with the latter leaving for @entity34 in a world - record deal for a teenager			1
the left - back improved markedly during his time under @entity1 and @entity5 , one of the @entity6 's first signings at @entity8 , hopes his game will be taken on in a similarly impressive fashion			1
' he was massive , ' @entity5 said			1
' to have an up - and - coming manager that has shown the qualities he has got , it is great to have someone like him show a lot of faith in you and that he really wants you here			2
' i was delighted when i knew the interest was there and he made it easy for me after speaking to him			2
' it has shown a lot of faith in me , bringing me here			0
i am grateful for that			0
' it was an opportunity i wanted to take , really , and i am sure he is expecting me to settle into his system as quickly as possible			0
' i think the way we used to play at @entity24 and the way that he likes to play in keeping the ball and moving it around as quickly as possible suits my game			2
' i think he could have seen that in me and hopefully i can bring that to this team			0
' development : @entity1 's work with @entity2 at @entity3 encouraged @entity75 to move to @entity8 @entity1 's style relies heavily on his full - backs , who are expected to race down the flanks as well as be steady defensive operators			1
one @entity3 player joked they needed two hearts to play in that manner , but @entity5 is loving it			1
' it is sometimes ( like you could do with an extra heart ) at full - back when he expects you to kind of be a winger and a defender at the same time , but that is part of my game , ' he said , chuckling			1
' i am a pretty fit player and i enjoy that , playing under him , and it allows me to play my game			0
' he has been great with all the lads and hopefully the system he wants us to play we can adapt to as quickly as possible			0
it 'll definitely be able to pick us up results			0
' @entity5 made his @entity8 debut on thursday night , playing the full 90 minutes as they came from behind to secure a 2 - 1 win at @entity105 in the @entity107 play - offs			1
pointing the way : @entity5 believes that @entity1 can help him develop and move forward with his game it was far from an easy match , thanks in no small part to the @entity115 heat and spirited opponents , and could mean the @entity118 international drops to the bench against @entity120 on sunday , with @entity121 starting instead			1
having just penned a new five - year deal , the @entity122 looks set to be a rival for a long time to come but it is competition that @entity5 thrives on			2
' it is going to make us both better players , hopefully , and that 's all we want to do as professionals , ' he said			2
' it is a good competition between us and we will be supporting each other whichever way it goes , really			0
' @entity135 has been great to me since i 've come in			0
he has help me settle well			0
' i could have easily expected to come in and have someone give me the cold shoulder , but i ca n't say that about him			0
' he has been great to me and it is a competition between us			0
we both want that number one jersey , but whoever does get it at the end of the day we are supporting the team and we 'll support each other			0
that 's the way it is going to be			2
