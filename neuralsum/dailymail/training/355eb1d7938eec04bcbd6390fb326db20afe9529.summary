a @entity190 iron was among the items seized during a july 5 search of the couple 's home			2
@entity13 was arrested that day			1
but mr @entity23 compared the charges to the childhood game of ' telephone ' , where something whispered from one person to another ultimately bears no resemblance to reality			0
' this is a situation where a person has taken a nugget of information , taken an acorn and tried to turn it into a tree , ' he said			0
' and the tree wo n't support this story			0
' back in @entity42 , only a handful of houses dot the side of the approximately two - mile road where the couple lives			0
