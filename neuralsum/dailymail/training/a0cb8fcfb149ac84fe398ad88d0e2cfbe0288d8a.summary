by @entity0 follow @ @ kie1410 a @entity2 team spearheaded by @entity3 recorded the worst defence of a @entity6 title in history , and the impending @entity9 striker did little to replicate his @entity11 form on the world stage			1
the 25 - year - old , on the verge of a £ 32million deal to join @entity9 from @entity15 , failed to register a single shot on target , as @entity21 's team self - destructed and were dumped out after two @entity20 defeats			1
indeed , he has been carrying a niggle and was gambled by @entity21			0
and yes , it 's ludicrous to condemn a player , who only last season led @entity15 to their first @entity11 title in 18 years with 27 goals , to failure after less than two @entity6 games			0
but it is hardly the vote of confidence that long - suffering @entity9 fans need			0
they have , after all , been through it with @entity22 - a player who has become renowned as a £ 50m flop since moving from @entity75 four years ago			2
but in @entity3 , they look to have found the solution to a problem , should he keep his @entity11 form instead of that at the @entity6 so far			2
in 126 minutes for @entity2 , @entity3 had two shots - neither on target - and scored none			1
it is a similar story for @entity22			0
in 68 minutes , the striker had zero shots , zero goals , zero points for the dead rubbers			0
the same goes for @entity44 's @entity23 in 58 minutes , whose form during his @entity91 loan spell was n't present at the @entity92 on tuesday			1
in fact , the forward did n't even touch the ball in @entity97 's box before being substituted at 1 - 0 down			0
@entity98 : @entity3 played as an out - and - out striker for @entity2 but their tiki - taka ways were lost on the forward overhead : @entity3 will look to break the trend of misfiring strikers that @entity9 seem to attract switch : @entity3 is substituted as @entity22 comes on , but the @entity9 striker could n't hit the target no go : @entity23 ( left ) and @entity24 ( right ) are yet to score in the @entity6 for @entity44 or @entity51 @entity24 , sidelined by an unfortunate knee injury , got away one shot against @entity111 in @entity51 's @entity6 opener , only to be denied by the post			1
he was benched for their follow - up 4 - 0 loss to @entity116			0
@entity3 's limited performances for @entity2 created a backlash on social media , as @entity9 fans voiced their opinions and worries			1
@entity123 can only hope the man who opted for @entity2 over @entity125 breaks the trend of misfiring strikers that @entity9 attract , and is just what they need to challenge for the @entity131 title next season			2
the boss : @entity123 hopes @entity3 will become a prolific @entity9 goalscorer next season			2

@entity2 's @entity3 and @entity22 , @entity44 's @entity23 and @entity51 's @entity24 have played *342* minutes between them
they *'ve* had three shots in total - none on target - and are yet to score
@entity3 agrees £ 32million move to @entity143 with @entity123
