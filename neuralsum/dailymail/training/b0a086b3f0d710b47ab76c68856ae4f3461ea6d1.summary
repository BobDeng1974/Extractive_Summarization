tireless ‘ name and shame ’ campaigner @entity0 has praised the @entity1 as it becomes the first jurisdiction in @entity3 to introduce a public sex offender register , to be named after murdered @entity6 teenager @entity7			1
@entity8 was murdered in 2003 , at the age of 13 , by a man with a long history of abusing children			0
@entity0 has urged other states that they must now follow in introducing a website that would include an image , physical description and regional whereabouts of convicted ‘ serious sex offenders ’			1
' this is a crack in the wall			0
i thought it would be @entity6 that became the first state to crumble			0
but now one has the others will fall in line too			0
it wo n’t happen overnight but it will happen , ' mr @entity0 told @entity28			1
’ the move comes after a decade of @entity8 's parent 's , @entity30 and @entity31 , calling for a national sex offender register , a proposal recently rejected by other states and territories at a @entity36			1
' every parent has the right to know if there is a dangerous sex offender living in their neighbourhood , ' they said in a statement			2
' mr @entity0 added : ‘ i ca n’t stress how important it is that it ’s going to happen … you ca n’t listen to the rubbish saying it will drive them underground - they are already underground			2
their biggest weapon is secrecy			0
' the veteran journalist , who was informed of the @entity1 legislation by @entity67 , said it is important for the website to be nationalised or sex offenders will simply move and cross state borders			1
‘ if you are a predator in the @entity1 and a photo description of you is online , why would n’t you move elsewhere in @entity3 ? ’ he asked			2
tireless ‘ name and shame ’ campaigner @entity0 has praised the new legislation mr @entity0 , who has served time in jail and five weeks under house arrest as a consequence of his belief that the public have ‘ a right to know ’ who sex offenders are , said that @entity3 is home to over 100,000 predators			1
in @entity86 there are 7,000 convicted sex offenders , for example , but he claims ' even police officers do n’t have an automatic right to know who or where they are '			0
this year mr @entity0 completed a ten - day , 180 - kilometre , walk from @entity93 , where he had been serving 50 days in lieu of a $ 100,000 fine for contempt of court , to @entity98 ’s @entity97			2
upon reaching @entity97 , flanked by @entity7 ’s parents , he presented a petition with nearly 130,000 names calling for a national public register of convicted paedophiles			2
@entity67 phoned him on wednesday to share the @entity1 news			0
@entity8 's parents , @entity31 and @entity67 , were in @entity106 for the announcement after campaigning for years for a national sex offenders register @entity109 , chief minister of the @entity1 , announced that the @entity111 legislation will be named @entity50 ' he said hey “ it ’s going to happen in the @entity1 ” he knows how passionate i am			1
' it is finally a sign of progress for the ardent campaigner , who spent two weeks in solitary confinement in a locked prison cell just metres away from convicted sex offenders – the people he is fighting against - while in jail this year			2
mr @entity0 explained that there has been resistance to introduce a public sex offenders register in @entity3 because of fears of vigilante action			1
however , after visiting the @entity128 , where they have had a public register named @entity131 since 1996 , mr @entity0 is convinced it would work in @entity3			1
‘ in @entity134 they have more guns than @entity136 but the register works there , ’ mr @entity0 said			1
@entity8 was last seen waiting at a bus stop on the @entity139 when he was abducted and later murdered by serial child sex offender @entity140			2
it was another eight years before his remains were found @entity30 and @entity143 , seen here leaving the @entity144 in @entity145 on march 13 , 2014 , when a jury found @entity140 , 44 , guilty of the abduction and murder of their son ‘ when i was in @entity151 the sheriff showed me street signs saying “ warning predator lives here " … i got an app on my phone in @entity155 [ in @entity158 ] that showed me there were 25 predators in the area – it showed me their name , photos and address			0
‘ i drove around @entity134 with @entity166 , @entity167 ’ victim , the app showed us paedophiles ' houses			0
it means people can warn their children “ do n’t knock on that door ” … that ’s the common sense attitude , ’ mr @entity0 reasoned			1
in his eyes ‘ knowledge is power ’			0
mr @entity0 said he is still waiting to find out the details of @entity50 , for example “ what constitutes a serious sex offender ” , but hopes that within three years there is a national register			1
' the federal government has the power to overturn the legislation but i do n’t think they would be stupid enough to do this , ' mr @entity0 added			1
prime minister @entity193 has indicated he 's not in favour of a national sex offenders register federal coalition mp @entity196 has also urged the @entity193 government to roll out the register nationally , saying sex offenders gave up their right to privacy by committing the ' most heinous of crimes '			1
' parents have a right to know where these serious sex offenders are and what they look like so they can protect their children , ' the @entity196 said			0
' we owe it to the @entity211 and to all parents to do whatever we can to avoid the same thing happening again			0
' however , prime minister @entity193 has indicated he 's not in favour of a national sex offenders register , saying such lists do n't exist for murderers , thieves or white collar criminals			1
mr @entity193 says he 's ' disinclined ' to single out particular crimes for public registers			2
' we do n't have a national murders register			0
we do n't have a national thieves register			0
we do n't have a national white collar criminals register , ' he told reporters in @entity227			0
' the important thing is ... to have strong and effective law enforcement agencies , to have strong and effective laws			0

the @entity1 will introduce a public sex offender register website
new legislation will be named @entity50 after murdered @entity6 teenager @entity7
it is based on similar legislation in the @entity128 , but *unlike* the @entity128 laws will not give the exact address of an offender
people will be able to see an image , physical description and regional whereabouts of offenders in the territory
' name and shame ' campaigner @entity0 wants a national register
he does not believe vigilante action against offenders would be a *problem*
' in @entity134 they have more guns than @entity136 but the register works there , ' mr @entity0 said
prime minister @entity193 has indicated he 's not in favour of the register
