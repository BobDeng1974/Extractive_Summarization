by @entity0 @entity1 ' the @entity2 , @entity3 ' @entity4 , @entity5 ' @entity6 , @entity8 ' @entity7 ... the names say it all : these are not men you 'd want to mess with - at least not when it comes to fighting ( although one of them is also a solicitor - more of which later )			1
they are all bare - knuckle boxers , who punch , swipe , sweat and grunt their way through this brutish @entity24 ' sport ' in a makeshift hay bale ring - egged on by a crowd of ( mostly ) blokes swigging beer and recording the proceedings on their mobile phones			1
victory is generally defined as seeing your opponent lying bloodied and unconscious on the ground			0

this legal but ungoverned sport has enjoyed a surge in popularity in recent years thanks to the work of promoter @entity50 , whose b - bad promotions outfit , based in @entity52 , aims to bring legitimacy to this forgotten fisticuffs with a slew of crowd - pleasing bouts			1
@entity8 ' @entity7 is a charming @entity92 traveller - and self - confessed ' softie ' - whose match preparations consist almost solely of drinking up to 25 pints of @entity94 a day to meet his required match weight a punter films the @entity39 - @entity98 fight on his phone			2
the makeshift combat arena seen here is bordered with hay bales the violent combat was once confined to back - street drinking dens and gambled on by gangland villains			0
fights could last for more than two hours - with rounds lasting as long as the opponents were able to stay on their feet			2
it was often a fight to the death , with no rules - and definitely no first aid			2
but the practice is enjoying something of a renaissance - and it 's completely legal			2
bare - knuckle boxing was never outlawed but with the emergence of the @entity120 and gloved bouts in 1867 it shrank into the back streets to be taken over by villains			1
the combatants are different from the old days , with builders , property developers and spray - painters getting involved			0
fans say bare - knuckle fighting is no different to any other martial art , although it comes under the same ' dangerous exhibition ' statute as knife - throwing			1

at 32 and with 200 fights under his belt , he is a relative youngster on the scene compared to @entity39 , a 46 - year - old drug smuggler - turned - solicitor fighting men half his age in @entity43 , @entity44			2
@entity50 had hoped for the fight to take place this evening at @entity151 in @entity152 , @entity153 - but it was postponed at the last minute due to ' planning and licensing issues '			1
if the @entity159 fight does eventually go ahead , it will be the biggest event the scene has known since it went underground in the 19th century			0
@entity38 also explores the mental strain of a life dedicated to fighting when @entity59 meets @entity164 , an undefeated fighter turned life - coach and self - styled ' mr happy '			0
@entity164 is now so disgusted by his violent past that he refuses even to ball his fists anymore			0
but the allure of the bare knuckle remains strong for many others - and that 's got to be good news for @entity176 , and suppliers of hay bales			2
@entity37 is the latest in the award - winning @entity74 series , a strand of distinctive documentaries from @entity38 that offers unflinching , honest and powerful insights into @entity24 ’s untold stories , which can also be seen on its @entity186 channel			2
