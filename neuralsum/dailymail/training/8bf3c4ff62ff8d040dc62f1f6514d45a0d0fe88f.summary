mr @entity0 told her ' unwelcome publicity ' received after affair with mr @entity4 was ' situation entirely of her own making ' mp @entity4 's partner @entity7 has lost her privacy and harassment claim against @entity10 , which publishes the @entity11			1
her affair with the former secretary of state for energy and climate change became public in june 2010 , with mr @entity4 leaving his wife of 26 years			1
the 44 - year - old pr adviser sued for compensation and an injunction over 65 ' highly unpleasant and hurtful ' articles which have appeared since then			2
she claimed she was subject to ' crude and demeaning stereotypes ' about her being bisexual			0
dismissed : @entity7 gives a statement today outside the @entity23 after today 's hearing but despite ms @entity7 's lawyers claiming the stories constituted a ' cataclysmic interference ' with her private life , a high court judge today rejected her claim on the grounds that her involvement with the former energy secretary was ' a situation of her own making '			1
the high court judge also said he had not found ms @entity7 to be a good or reliable witness in a number of respects			1
@entity10 described the ruling by mr @entity0 as ' an important example of the press exercising its right to free speech '			1
@entity10 had contested ms @entity7 's case on the basis that there was an important public interest			1
ms @entity7 's counsel , @entity49 , said the @entity11 had a right to freedom of expression but not to abuse her repeatedly under the guise of exercising that freedom			2
ms @entity7 was in court today but showed no emotion as her claim was dismissed by the judge			1
relationship : @entity4 and @entity60 , pictured last september , had an affair which became public in june 2010 he said : ' ms @entity7 was not the purely private figure she claims to be			1
her reasonable expectation of privacy has become limited			0
' this is mainly by reason of her involvement with mr @entity4 , both professionally , as his press agent , and personally as his secret mistress , in circumstances where he campaigned with a leaflet to the electorate of @entity74 about how much he valued his family			1
' but it is also by reason of what she herself has disclosed in the past			0
' further , she was , as the defendant knew , a journalist who had herself disclosed information about other people for publication in the newspapers and so was a person who ought not reasonably to be expected to be distressed when such information was published about herself			0
' ' ms @entity7 has shown little sign of recognising how what she herself has done has given rise to the publicity she finds so unwelcome			1
' the difficult situation she found herself in was of her own making			0
ms @entity7 , speaking today on the steps of the @entity23 , was not found to be a good or reliable witness during her claim by mr @entity0 ' one reason why it is objectionable for a sexual relationship to arise between people who are already in a professional or work relationship is that there is then a greatly increased risk of conflicts arising between professional duty and personal interest			1
' it was this crossing of boundaries which led an editorial executive on the newspaper to consider that ms @entity7 's role in the story of mr @entity4 was so significant , he added			1
' professionally , it was her job to ensure that mr @entity4 received the best possible publicity , but it was the sexual affair on which she embarked , and which she continued to conduct , with mr @entity4 that gave rise to the scandal			1
he added that although @entity10 referred to ms @entity7 's sexuality in 65 articles over 15 months , it only did so when writing about matters of public interest - mainly developments in mr @entity4 's personal life which were relevant to his public life - and when ms @entity7 , her conduct and other information about her were within the range of what an editor could in good faith regard as relevant to the story			1
' the distress that she has undoubtedly suffered since june 19 , 2010 is the result of the publication by the defendant of the defamatory and true information concerning her , about which she has not made a claim in defamation , and the actions of journalists and publishers for whom the defendant is not responsible			0
' to the extent that the words complained of include insults and other offensive matter , insulting and offensive speech is protected by the right of freedom of expression			0
' in this case what ms @entity7 complains of is not so unreasonable that it is necessary or proportionate to sanction or prohibit such publications in order to protect the rights of ms @entity7			2
' so the defendant has not harassed her within the meaning of the @entity165			0
it is not the case that a reasonable person in the position of the defendant ought to have known that these articles , separately , or cumulatively , amount to harassment of ms @entity7			2
' he added that ms @entity7 had no reasonable expectation of privacy in relation to various items of information , including cropped versions of photos taken at her civil partnership ceremony , which revealed no more information about her than the public already knew			2
ms @entity7 was not the purely private figure she claims to be			2
her reasonable expectation of privacy has become limited			0
' outside court , ms @entity7 said she intended to appeal			2
ms @entity7 , who is insured , was ordered to pay £ 250,000 towards @entity10 ’s costs			2
a spokesman for @entity10 said : ' this was an important example of the press exercising its right to free speech in relation to matters of significant public interest			1
a high court judge told ms @entity7 , pictured left today and right at the @entity198 last september , that she was in a situation ' of her own making ' ' we are pleased that the @entity23 agreed with us and has today dismissed all of miss @entity7 ’s complaints			1
' the references to miss @entity7 ’s sexuality in our coverage were never pejorative , private or in any way homophobic			0
' @entity208 chose to level some very serious charges against our journalists in this case			0
this judgement vindicates both our journalists and their journalism			0
media law specialist @entity215 said mr @entity0 , in his judgment , had drawn a distinction between private and public figures by importing the @entity221 notion of a public figure			0
' it is redolent of the approach taken to @entity226 's affair with @entity227 , ' he said			0
' mr @entity226 , as president , had a restricted zone of privacy , and ms @entity227 's zone of privacy was reduced by virtue of her relationship with him			0
' it appears that that ratio was very similar in this case			0

@entity244 adviser who had relationship with former energy secretary had sued @entity10 over ' unpleasant and hurtful ' articles
but judge tells her her ' expectation of privacy has become limited '
she was involved with former minister ' professionally and personally ' as both his press agent and his secret mistress
ms @entity7 was ' not found to be a good or reliable witness ' during claim
@entity10 hails *decision* as ' important example of the press exercising its right to free speech '
mr @entity0 told her ' unwelcome publicity ' received after affair with mr @entity4 was ' situation entirely of her own making '
