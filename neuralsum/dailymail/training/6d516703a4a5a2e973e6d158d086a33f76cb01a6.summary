reality tv star and one - time @entity2 governor @entity1 is out with a new op - ed today bashing president @entity3 for participating in ' frivolous , inefficient , über - partisan , distracting events ' instead of solving @entity6 's problems			1
@entity1 pointed to @entity3 's schedule of activities during a trip to @entity10 , @entity11 , earlier this week as proof of his misplaced priorities			1
' president @entity3 was absolutely swamped the other night , staving off the munchies at a pizza party in the @entity21 city , hobnobbing as headliner at numerous @entity24 shindigs , collecting big bucks from big donors all day , ' @entity1 , a @entity16 contributor , wrote on @entity16			1
racking balls , getting buzzed on suds , maybe humming “ @entity32 ” while kicking it in those @entity31 , hard choices had to be made – stripes or solids ? former @entity2 gov. @entity1 , pictured here at the @entity35 in may , took on president @entity3 in an op - ed today for blowing off his presidential duties ' and that beer – do i drink it if the mountains are n’t blue ? talk about miscues , ' @entity1 continued , colorfully giving her version of the president 's night out on the town with @entity11 governor @entity46 , whom she refers to in the piece as ' @entity48			1
' @entity3 ran into the @entity50 governor on tuesday night at a bar in @entity10 , and the two had a beer together and played a game of pool , which @entity3 says he won			0
@entity1 frequently bashes the president for what she perceives as failed leadership , and the fiery former politician had no shortage of complaints about @entity3 's ' offensive ' behavior in her op - ed today			1
from the president 's refusal to visit the border during his trip to @entity68 to the ' fancy talkin ’ , photo - opin ’ and fundraisin ’ events he held there , @entity1 snarkily berated the president for nearly everything he did - and did n't do - this week			1
' but , seriously , our commander - in - chief is busy , as @entity77 burns , ' she said after making fun of the administration 's now - halted plans renovate the @entity82 bowling ally			0
she also reprised her claims from earlier this week that @entity3 should be impeached for his overstepping his authority			1
@entity1 first made the charge in an op - ed on @entity87 on tuesday			0
there , she insisted that @entity3 was deliberately leaving @entity6 's border with @entity90 unsecured because he wants to destroy the country			1
' without borders , there is no nation			0
@entity3 knows this , ' she wrote			0
today , she did n't bother to explain what @entity3 had done to be thrown out of office - ' no need to waste ink trying to educate the “ deniers ” ' - and jumped straight to encouraging her fans to pressure members of @entity104 who ' denounce @entity3 as a lawless imperial president with a destructively scandal - riddled administration ' to draw up articles of impeachment			1
president @entity3 has a beer at @entity111 with @entity11 gov. @entity46 on tuesday in @entity10 @entity3 and @entity46 also played a game of pool			2
@entity3 said at a @entity50 fundraiser the following day that he won numerous @entity35 lawmakers have teased the idea of impeaching the president , but none have introduced legislation to remove him from office			2
part of their hesitation comes from the fact that @entity50 currently have a lock on the @entity125			0
even if @entity127 - controlled @entity82 did indict the president for abusing his powers , there 's no chance senate minority leader @entity131 , a @entity24 , would allow similar charges to come to the upper chamber 's floor			0
' it ’s one of those things that if you ca n’t see an end solution , why even get into that debate ? ' rep. @entity140 told @entity141			0
unless both legislative bodies pass articles of impeachment , the process of booting the president from office can not move forward			0
@entity1 said on friday that the @entity82 should impeach the president regardless of whether the @entity125 follows suit			2
' if senators are n’t ballsy enough to use their power of the purse to stop this nonsense , then they must hand the baton to the @entity82 and support our representatives in impeachment proceedings , ' she said			0
while the majority of @entity127 may agree with @entity1 that @entity3 should be charged with wrongdoing - no recent polling data on the topic exists - a recent survey shows @entity1 is n't the best @entity35 personality to lead the charge			1
a @entity169 / @entity168 / @entity167 survey taken between june 30 to july 7 , a day before @entity1 took up the impeachment mantle , discovered that 52 percent of @entity6 want @entity1 to sit down and shut up , including almost two out of every five self - described conservatives			2
@entity1 was rated the most annoying former politician in the poll , beating out former president @entity174 , former civil rights activist @entity175 , former speaker of the house and current crossfire host @entity177 and former vice presidents @entity180 and @entity181 for the dishonor .			2

@entity1 berated @entity3 for nearly everything he did this week
she also reprised calls for @entity127 in @entity104 to impeach the president
@entity1 continued to attack the president in spite of a recent poll that shows @entity6 are growing tired of her
