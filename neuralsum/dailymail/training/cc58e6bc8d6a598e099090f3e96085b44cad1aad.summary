@entity1 is in contention to start for @entity6 against @entity9 in the @entity8 wasps director @entity0 will sympathise with @entity1 if he is not selected by @entity21 @entity22 should replace injured number eight @entity23 , leaving @entity1 potentially competing with @entity25 for the blindside jersey with captain @entity27 inked in at seven			1
' i do n't think he 'll be shoved into eight , but i 'd feel for him if he 's not starting to be quite honest , ' said @entity0			2
' i think he 's by far the form back - rower in @entity6			2
' i know i 'm biased and i 'm not pretending i 'm not			0
' i know i 'm biased and maybe one - eyed , i 'm certainly not going to knock any of the other players because i think they 're all real quality players			0
