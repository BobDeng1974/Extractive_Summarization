@entity0 - 384 points 2			1
@entity2 - 317 points 3			1
@entity4 238 points @entity0 is king of the @entity6 again			1
under the dark sky of @entity9 , fireworks greeted the 29 - year - old @entity11 boy turned global superstar as only the fourth @entity13 to win multiple @entity15 world titles			2
the fourth in line to another throne , prince @entity19 , went to the pit wall to tell @entity0 over the radio : ‘ @entity0 , thank you very , very much for not making the @entity24 public sweat			1
you are an absolute legend			0
’ the team then came on to tell @entity0 he was @entity27 ’s first champion since a chap called @entity29 , in 1955			1
@entity29 was the greatest of them all , but @entity0 is hardly a slouch			1
would @entity0 hold on to his lead of 17 points , or would @entity2 spoil his day ? but it was , as @entity69 observed , all in control long before the 55th and concluding lap. so much so that @entity2 , suffering battery problems , was lapped by @entity0 on the penultimate circuit			1
@entity0 took the victory , with @entity2 14th , and the title by 67 points			1
double scoring , the great pre-race fear , was immaterial			0
and when it was over , @entity2 sought @entity0 out and held him , congratulating a friend who has turned into a bitter rival in the course of a captivating nine months			1
it was a typically gracious gesture from the vanquished man			0
as for @entity0 , his name can be added to @entity84 , @entity85 and sir @entity86 in the pantheon of @entity24 double title winners			1
six years separate @entity0 ’s first and second championships , but now the greatness he promised as a rookie of prodigious gifts has been rewarded as richly as his talent warrants			1
the race had been set up perfectly by @entity2 searing to pole position by 0.386sec			1
saturday has been the @entity97 ’s day for most of the year			0
but it is sunday that counts and @entity0 took little more than a blink of an eye to roar into the lead			1
@entity2 trundled off the grid			1
@entity0 powered ahead , swept to his right in front of his colleague and flew through the first left - hand corner			1
by the time @entity2 came round it , @entity0 was virtually in @entity109			1
all weekend @entity0 had exhibited tell - tale jitters , given exasperated answers in press conferences and issued false protestations about being cooler than a cucumber in a tumbler of @entity117 ’s			1
prince @entity19 congratulates @entity0 over the team radio , and right , the @entity27 man celebrates his triumph with @entity50 @entity0 won the @entity121 having lead the race from the first corner after overtaking @entity2 @entity0 ended the season with a win which sealed him the second @entity127 ' championship of his career @entity0 held on to win by just under three seconds from @entity58 , with @entity59 also getting on the podium for @entity61 @entity130 secures title in @entity9 all those worries were dispatched to the file marked ‘ i ’ for irrelevance in one faultless move			1
from that moment , the outcome seemed inevitable			0
and that is rare with @entity0 , a man who has produced more drama over the years than @entity139			2
still , how must it have felt for @entity0 ’s family who were late , surprise arrivals in @entity9			2
his father @entity143 paced up and down , as his wont			0
his pop - star girlfriend @entity50 , step - mother @entity146 and brother @entity147 , in a @entity27 top , were all in the garage , their eyes fixed on the timing screens			2
but before the sun had set , in the twilight of this dusk - night race , @entity0 had established a comfortable lead			1
by his first stop , 10 laps in , his advantage was 2.7sec			0
@entity2 stayed out a lap longer but it did him no good on rubber that was only getting worse			2
@entity2 ’s engineer @entity161 came over the radio to explain their remedial strategy : ‘ keep the gap to him ( @entity166 ) manageable and we ’ll go long			2
’ @entity2 had a race to forget as he lost the lead on the first corner of the race and then suffered with a power failure @entity0 takes the lead on the very first corner of the race after overtaking @entity2 who started on pole @entity0 got off to the best - possible start as he overtook @entity2 on the first corner and saw his car home to win the grand prix but within minutes , the @entity97 veered off track			1
that was nothing compared to the problems he was about to suffer with his energy recovery system ( @entity188 )			0
‘ it ’ s failed , ’ he said over the radio			0
that was costing him 160bhp and three seconds a lap. he started to slither down the field			2
@entity0 came in for new tyres as his own time was briefly dipping — @entity50 ’s bottom lip quivered — but he only needed to be re-shod			2
he came out and zoomed straight past @entity2 , who had yet to pit again			2
both men were totally fair and clean			0
now @entity2 had just one chance : namely , to score heavily enough to take the title if @entity0 were to stop			1
‘ just get me into the top five or six as safely as possible , ’ he said			0
actually , he would have needed fifth to have had a hope in hell			0
‘ how am i looking ? ’ he inquired , while lying seventh and fading			0
‘ not good at the moment , ’ he was told			0
‘ what the hell does that mean ? what do i need to do ? ’ ‘ just drive flat out			0
’ it was truly the most pathetic exchange of the season			0
but it was not the last of its sort			0
‘ hey guys , what ’s going on ? ’ he asked			0
‘ the car switched off and now the throttle is all over the place			2
get my brake pedal back now please			0
’ @entity2 was told to retire , but vowed to drive on regardless			2
@entity58 tried hard to catch @entity0 but he had to settle for second , a place ahead of his @entity61 team - mate @entity59			1
so the glory went to @entity166 , and who can say he did not deserve it ? he is an extraordinary @entity24 sportsman at something like the peak of his powers			0
his 11 wins to @entity2 ’s five is a fair reflection of his superiority			2
his jewellery is not to everyone ’s taste			0
but there is no denying sheer ability when you are privileged enough to see it			0
he has also worked hard , carving through the field after the bugler had sounded the @entity242 at the end of several qualifying sessions			0
a mark of @entity0 ’s achievement is that he beat @entity2 , who , through dedication and willpower , made his talent go even further than nature intended			1
but , as in their karting days , it ended up with @entity254 , @entity255			0
@entity61 ' driver @entity58 took the lead in the @entity121 but came second in the final race of the season a tv broadcast shows @entity262 ' @entity261 driver pastor @entity260 leaving his burning car during the @entity121 @entity0 's girlfriend @entity50 arrived to watch her boyfriend win his second @entity15 title @entity268 and @entity4 wave to the crowd ahead of the race in what could be the @entity273 's final race in @entity15 prince @entity19 speaks with @entity4 and @entity275 principal @entity274 ahead of the race			1

@entity2 started @entity121 from pole position but was overtaken by @entity0 at the first corner
@entity2 finished outside the points as he suffered power failure with his car and was lapped by his team - mate
@entity58 finished second in his @entity61 while his team - mate @entity59 was third
@entity268 , in what could be his final grand prix , finished fifth
