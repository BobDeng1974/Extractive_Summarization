‘ you are never going to be able to do that again , unless you become a professional dancer , but it is just amazing how fit it makes you			2
‘ i would say that all in all , i lost about a stone in weight			2
' it means that for @entity25 , at the beginning of the series we were n’t doing much lifting			2
suddenly there appeared to be all these lifts and no one knew why			2
it was because i was a stone lighter			0
