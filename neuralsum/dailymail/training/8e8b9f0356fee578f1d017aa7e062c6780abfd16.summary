by @entity0 @entity1 has urged angry @entity3 fans to focus on her bid to turn the ailing club around - instead of channelling their energies into ousting embattled chairman @entity7			1
in her first extensive interview since becoming chief executive at @entity10 , @entity1 assured sceptical supporters that she would be given complete freedom to do her job , without interference from the unpopular @entity7			1
and she cast doubt over @entity17 ’s future as manager by refusing to confirm the @entity19 would still be in charge of the relegated outfit when they kick off next season in the championship			1
in charge : @entity1 has assured @entity3 fans that she will be in complete control of the club former @entity30 ceo @entity1 , who only began work as @entity7 ’s successor on monday , insisted she would prefer to hold formal talks with @entity17 first before deciding which direction the club would be taking in a highly - competitive second tier featuring @entity36 and city rivals @entity37			1
her arrival in @entity39 has coincided with the launch of a ‘ @entity41 ’ campaign - fronted by a number of prominent former players and supporters ’ organisations in an attempt to oust the 58 - year - old from his non-executive role			1
a rally is planned for this morning outside the stadium , where @entity1 is scheduled to meet a cross-section of fans represented on the working together umbrella group			1
however , she ‘ categorically ’ rejected fears from supporters - who blame @entity7 for the club ’s relegation - that she will not be allowed to bring about the changes necessary			1
asked in an extensive interview what she made of the row that had greeted her arrival at the club , @entity1 said : ‘ it ’s not been as i anticipated , let ’s put it that way			2
it ’s been a challenging first few days , quite possibly the most challenging a new ceo could face , but i ’m not fazed by it			2
‘ we find ourselves in a very challenging position and we need to refocus , but it is what it is ; i ca n’t change anything			0
i just need to get on with the job			0
’ in response to whether she would be allowed to conduct the changes she wants , she added : ‘ i can be quite clear on that			0
i was running a football club , and let ’s be honest a very successful football club , and when i was approached to come here that was one of my main concerns			0
am i going to have the autonomy to go and do the job , the job that is required at this football club ? ‘ let ’s be frank , @entity3 has n’t had the best on - field results in the last couple of years			2
it ’s a matter of fact , we have n’t performed the way we need to			0
i saw an opportunity to come in and improve on that			0
on his way ? there is no guarantee that @entity17 will still be manager at @entity10 next season ‘ i was n’t going to walk away from a job where i had complete autonomy , the absolute support of the chairman to actually do the job that was required , the absolute support of the board to do the job required , to walk into another post where my hands were going to be tied			1
‘ i think i ’ve got enough integrity , and i would certainly hope reputation , that people would know i would n’t do that			0
‘ i ’ve got the ball now , the responsibility is on me , the focus needs to go on me			0
‘ the choices i make and the recommendations i make to the board are going to be the ones which are hopefully going to take the club forward and which i will be judged on			0
‘ to say that the chairman needs to go is , in my view , quite a simplistic approach and actually probably quite an unfair one			2
‘ i ’m picking up the baton , if you like , and it ’s me that is going to have to take that responsibility			0
‘ we ’ve got a board of directors , we operate independently , and part of my viewpoint here is we have to start acting more like a football club than a corporate entity , and that is the direction i want to take us in			2
baptism of fire : @entity138 , pictured with @entity7 , admits it 's been a challenging start to her role ‘ is it going to be my way forward ? categorically			1
i can be asked that question any number of times and it will be the same answer , and i have to be judged on that			0
’ @entity1 was less clear on the future of @entity17 , who was widely perceived to have escaped the axe despite presiding over the team ’s relegation			1
the pair met last week when a number of players were being freed , but at that point @entity1 was still officially an employee of @entity30			1
she insisted that discussions with the @entity19 - who arrived at the club in november when @entity3 were seventh in the table - would not have been appropriate at that time			2
the duo have since spoken on the phone but will meet in person next week			0
responding to a question on whether @entity17 would still be in charge next season , @entity1 pointedly failed to take the opportunity to firm up the former @entity30 and @entity168 manager ’s position			1
@entity169 ? @entity3 players stand dejected after their @entity171 play off final defeat she told @entity174 : ‘ i met @entity17 for the first time in the capacity of him being the @entity3 manager last week when i went to the training facility			1
at that time emotions were obviously very high and relegation had just happened			0
‘ i was still ceo of @entity30 at that point , so no decisions or formal discussions could take place			1
‘ so , @entity17 went off to finish his family holiday and has since come back			2
we ’ve spoken on a few occasions since and there are plans to meet @entity17 next week			2
‘ once we ’ve had that conversation and we ’ve come to a conclusion on the direction of the club i can come out and talk			0
‘ but it was far too early to say i would do anything at that point and as my previous role was still intact it was n’t appropriate either			0

@entity1 assures @entity3 fans she 's in complete control
former @entity30 ceo has had a *difficult* start with supporters determined to oust chairman @entity7
@entity1 can not guarantee that manager @entity17 will be at @entity10 next season
