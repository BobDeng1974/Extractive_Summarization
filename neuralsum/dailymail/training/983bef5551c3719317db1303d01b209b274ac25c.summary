asteroids contain hidden messages in their magnetic fields that could provide clues about the death of our planet			2
this is according to @entity9 scientists who have , for the first time , captured the dying moments a meteorite 's magnetic field - a fate that could be shared with @entity15			1
they unravelled the message by looking at tiny ' space magnets ' in meteorites which retain a memory of the birth and death of the asteroid 's core			1
@entity9 scientists have , for the first time , captured the dying moments a meteorite 's magnetic field			1
the magnetic message contained within could provide clues to @entity15 's fate billions of years from now			1
the particular meteorites used for this study are known as pallasites ( pictured ) , mostly made of iron and nickel the readings , they say , provide a tantalising glimpse into how @entity15 's magnetic core will behave as it continues to freeze			1
this is of concern to scientists because the core affects the @entity15 's magnetic field , which has weakened by 15 per cent over the last 200 years			1
with a weakened magnetic field , the planet could be exposed to solar winds capable of punching holes into the ozone layer			1
the impact could be devastating for mankind , knocking out power grids , radically changing @entity15 's climate and eventually leading to the planet 's demise			1

with a weakened field , the planet could be exposed to solar winds capable of punching holes in the ozone layer ( artist 's impression pictured ) using a huge x-ray microscope , dubbed a synchrotron , scientists at @entity64 decoded the message in meteorites			2
the @entity15 's core affects the planets magnetic field			1
as it freezes , the magnetic field weakens			2
the process has already begun			0
recent research have found that the magnetic field has weakened by 15 per cent over the last 200 years			2

the impact could be devastating for mankind , knocking out power grids , radically changing @entity15 's climate and eventually leading to the planet 's demise			1
' this is serious business ' , @entity85 , professor of @entity15 , @entity86 and ecological sciences at @entity88 told @entity90			0
' imagine for a moment your electrical power supply was knocked out for a few months – very little works without electricity these days			0
' the @entity15 's climate would change drastically			2
in fact , a recent @entity96 study believes global warming is directly related to the magnetic field rather than co2 emissions			2
radiation at ground level would also increase , with some estimates suggesting overall exposure to cosmic radiation would double causing more deaths from cancer			0
if the magnetic field continues to decline , over billions of years , @entity15 could end up like @entity109 - a once oceanic world that has become a dry , barren planet incapable of supporting life			1
' observing magnetic fields is one of the few ways we can peek inside a planet , ' said dr @entity116 of @entity64 's @entity117 , who led the research			0
many asteroids had liquid outer cores , like @entity15 's , that gave them their own magnetic fields			1
just as @entity15 will in a billion years , the asteroids then cooled down until their cores were solid , a process which killed their magnetic fields			2
' it 's long been assumed that metal - rich meteorites have poor magnetic memories , since they are primarily composed of iron , which has a terrible memory – you would n't ever make a hard drive out of iron , for instance			0
' it was thought that the magnetic signals carried by metal - rich meteorites would have been written and rewritten many times during their lifetime , so no - one has ever bothered to study their magnetic properties in any detail			0
' the particular meteorites used for this study are known as pallasites , which are mostly made up of iron and nickel , studded with gem - quality silicate crystals			0
contained within these unassuming chunks of iron however , are tiny particles just 100 nanometres across – about one thousandth the width of a human hair			0
these are made of a unique magnetic mineral called tetrataenite , which is magnetically much more stable than the rest of the meteorite , and holds a message going back billions of years			2
' we 're taking ancient magnetic field measurements in nanoscale materials to the highest ever resolution in order to piece together the magnetic history of asteroids – it 's like a cosmic archaeological mission , ' said phd student @entity168 , the paper 's lead author			2
the study changes scientist 's perspective on the way magnetic fields were generated during the early life of the solar system			0
in their meteorites , scientists have been able to capture both the beginning and the end of core freezing			0
' it 's like a cosmic archaeological mission , ' said @entity168			0
pictured is the @entity188 meteor shower these meteorites came from asteroids created in the first few million years after the formation of the solar system			0
at that time , planetary bodies were heated by radioactive decay to temperatures hot enough to cause them to melt and segregate into a liquid metal core surrounded by a rocky mantle			0
tiny particles , smaller than one thousandth the width of a human hair , are trapped within the metal of meteorites			0
these tiny pieces of metal have retained the magnetic signature of the parent asteroid from its birth in the early solar system			1
they reveal the process by which the asteroid 's core froze , killing its magnetic field			1
it 's a process that is happening on a much larger scale to @entity15			2
in their meteorites , scientists have been able to capture both the beginning and the end of core freezing			0
the information will help them understand how these processes affected the @entity15 in the past and provide a possible glimpse of what might happen in the future			0
scientists now think that the @entity15 's core only began to freeze relatively recently in geological terms , maybe less than a billion years ago			1
how this freezing has affected the @entity15 's magnetic field is not known			1
as their cores cooled and began to freeze , the swirling motions of liquid metal , generated a magnetic field , just as the @entity15 does today			1
' it 's funny that we study other bodies in order to learn more about the @entity15 , ' said professor @entity242			0
' since asteroids are much smaller than the @entity15 , they cooled much more quickly , so these processes occur on shorter timescales , enabling us to study the whole process of core solidification			0

' in our meteorites we 've been able to capture both the beginning and the end of core freezing , which will help us understand how these processes affected the @entity15 in the past and provide a possible glimpse of what might happen in the future , ' said professor @entity116			0
however , the @entity15 's core is freezing rather slowly			1
the solid inner core is getting bigger , and eventually the liquid outer core will disappear , killing the @entity15 's magnetic field , which protects us from the sun 's radiation			1
' there 's no need to panic just yet , however , ' said professor @entity116			0
' the core wo n't completely freeze for billions of years , and chances are , the sun will get us first			0
' using an intense beam of x-rays to image the nanoscale magnetisation of the meteoritic metal , researchers led by the @entity64 were able to capture the precise moment when the core of the meteorite ’s parent asteroid froze			1
the measurements were made by the @entity285 synchrotron in @entity286 ( pictured )			0

scientists have captured dying moments of meteorite 's magnetic field
tiny metal particles revealed magnetic signature of its parent asteroid
this signature provides clues on how the asteroid 's core once froze
a similar process is happening to @entity15 's core over billions of years
if core freezes , @entity15 will lose its magnetic field and end up like @entity109
scientists are now analysing the process to determine planet 's fate
