@entity0 is n't letting an injury keep him from entertaining his @entity3 fans with one high - profile supporter , @entity4 , endorsing his rendition of @entity6			1
a video of @entity0 's car karaoke effort was posted on the @entity4 and the @entity10 facebook page and while the 34 - year - old striker 's enthusiasm ca n't be faulted , his command of the lyrics leaves a bit to be desired			2
