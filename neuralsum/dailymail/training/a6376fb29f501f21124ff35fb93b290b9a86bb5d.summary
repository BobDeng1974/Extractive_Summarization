two brothers who found the remains of the plane flown by their grandfather in the @entity4 have spent 12 years restoring it to working order			1
@entity7 and @entity8 from @entity9 , @entity10 , have scoured the globe looking for parts to rebuild the @entity14 plane once piloted by their grandfather , @entity15			1
the pair have spent out over £ 100,000 since they found three small parts in his shed following his death in 1983 and have finally completed the reconstruction this week			1
the rebuilt @entity22 , which was flown between 1914 and 1916 by @entity7 and @entity8 's grandfather @entity23 their grandfather @entity15 in @entity25 in 1916 with one of the seven @entity22 biplane he flew flight sub-lieutenant @entity15 ( left ) , in 1915 , and his grandson @entity28 ( right ) , 63 , who took on the task flight sub lieutenant @entity15 had flown the plane between 1914 and 1918 while serving with the @entity32 during the @entity34 campaign			1
on his return from battle the war hero had always told his family he would like to see the aircraft take to the skies once again			0
to honour their late grandfather 's wishes @entity7 , 63 , and @entity8 , 61 , along with friend and amateur pilot @entity44 , 66 , began looking for the other components that would complete the aircraft			1
starting with just a joystick , rudder bar and magneto - an electrical generator which uses magnets - found in the shed the trio have travelled the world looking for the rest of the parts - many no longer in existence - including the engine , which was purchased in @entity58			1
after a staggering 10,000 hours of building the plane from scratch , this week they put the final touches to the aircraft , which has a wingspan of 24ft and is 20ft in length			1
it is due to take the skies in spring next year and the trio plan to fly it over the @entity70 on july 1 , 2016 , marking exactly 100 years since the fateful day in 1916 when almost 20,000 @entity72 soldiers lost their lives in @entity74			1

@entity7 , who works as a mechanical engineer and is chairman of the @entity102 , said he believed his grandfather would be proud			1
he said : ' we grew up less than 10 miles from my grandfather in @entity107 so we heard all his war stories			0
' although he talked about flying a lot he had never mentioned keeping these parts before			0
' when we found them we knew they belonged to his favourite plane because the magneto was made by @entity115 , the @entity116 company			2
' back in those days it was very hard to get @entity116 parts obviously , but my grandfather had told us the story of how he traded a few bombs and some food to a @entity74 base in return for the @entity115 magneto			1
' so these parts came from that plane and it would make sense that he would keep hold of them because it was his favourite aircraft he had flown			1
' he said one day he would like to see it fly again over @entity72 skies			0
' the brother 's have spent over £ 10,000 on the plane and wanted to rebuilt it as a tribute to their grandfather who died in 1983 the aircraft will be the only flyable @entity14 anywhere in the world when it finally takes off			1
@entity7 is pictured with his wife @entity145 and the plane , which he says his grandfather would have been ' proud ' of these three pieces of the plane were discovered when @entity7 and his father , @entity150 , 91 , were clearing out @entity23 ' workshop , following his death in 1983			1
they quickly realised they had found the part which provides a spark for the engine , from the pilot 's beloved @entity159 aircraft			2
but it was not until mr @entity44 , a fellow amateur pilot , encouraged the family to start rebuilding the plane that the project came about			2
in 2002 , the trio began researching where they could find appropriate parts to start rebuilding the plane before work began in 2010			2
@entity7 , a grandfather - of - two , added : ' we had the parts for years and had the idea in the back of our minds that one day we would try to rebuild the plane			1
' but it was @entity44 who actually got us to make a start			0
' we started researching what the plane would look like and because the parts do n't exist anymore we had to plan what replacements we could still get now			1
' the three original bits we had only probably made up about two per cent of the whole thing , so there was so much left to do			0
' the only thing we did n't make ourselves was the engine , which we got from a @entity58 - based company and it 's is an actual 1917 engine in a beautiful condition			0
one of the @entity192 crashed on the island of @entity194 in @entity195 , which is now officially known as @entity196 , in march 1916 ' the aircraft is pretty much finished now apart from the petrol tank and the fabric covering the fuselage			0
' @entity8 and i live in @entity10 but @entity44 lives in @entity202 , so we took small things down to him and then brought them back in a trailer when he was working on it			1
' i think our grandfather would be proud of us re-building his favourite plane , but he 'd probably say we 've spent far too much time and money on it as well			2
' sub-lieutenant @entity211 , nicknamed ' @entity212 ' because he was always twitching his nose , was in active service between , throughout the whole of the @entity4			0
after the war he worked as a patents engineer in @entity220 , @entity107 and lived with his wife @entity221 , and two sons , @entity223 , and @entity8 and @entity7 's father			1
during 1916 , officer @entity211 had been stationed on the islands of @entity194 and @entity25 in the @entity226 as part of the @entity32 , and flew seven @entity14 planes			2
his favourite plane of the seven had @entity231 and he kept three small parts of that aircraft in his workshop until he died aged 89			2
@entity8 , a builder and father - of - two from @entity237 , added : ' it 's been a huge privilege to be part of this project			2
' we all just wish my grandfather was here to answer a lot of questions we have about details of the plane , because he could have told us straight away			0
' we have old photos of what the plane should look like , but when you try to zoom in to look a specific details , it 's too grainy to make out			0
' but fortunately we got there in the end - its been a long old labour of love but it 's been worth it			0
' i think its a fitting tribute to my grandad and other @entity72 pilots who battled so valiantly for us during the @entity4			0
' flight sub-lieutenant @entity266 , nicknamed ' @entity212 ' can be seen in the seat of the @entity14 on @entity25 , @entity268 , in june 1916 this is the map that @entity266 used to fly 89 miles across water from @entity271 to @entity25			1
most if it was out of sight with no radio and an unreliable compass the @entity14 was a single - engine , single - seat fighter intended to supply ground commanders with an advantageous ' eye in the sky '			0
the initial prototype , @entity282 , was unveiled in 1913 with a top speed of 100 miles per hour , a service ceiling of 14,000 feet and an endurance of 2.5 hours			2
its design was regarded as very streamlined and consisted of a well - contoured fuselage with the single rotary piston engine set to the front and a conventional tail to the rear			0
the engine powered a two - bladed wooden propeller and the open air cockpit was held just under and aft of the upper wing assembly with generally adequate views			0
the @entity298 was established as an early militarised form and led to the development of the @entity301 – which was the one flown by the @entity15 's grandfather			1
type c aircraft was first ordered by the @entity72 government on november 5 , 1914 , in a 12 aircraft production batch for the @entity306			0
@entity307 was later commissioned by the competing @entity32 ( @entity32 ) in a 24 - aircraft batch and its first combat was in february 1915			0
it was armed with a standardised mounting and a 7.7mm @entity312 machine gun along the left side of the fuselage away from the spinning propeller arc			0
some were also finished with their guns fielded across the upper wing assembly			0
its targets ranged from enemy aircraft ( patrol , escort , interception ) , bombers , observation balloons , ground - based ' targets of opportunity ' and even @entity329 , which regularly patrolled airspaces			0
the c type @entity14 was followed by @entity332 in november 1915 , when 210 aircraft were produced			2

@entity7 and @entity8 found three parts of the plane once piloted by their grandfather in his shed after he died
flight sub lieutenant @entity15 had flown @entity14 plane between 1914 and 1916 during service
they started with joystick , rudder bar and magneto but scoured globe for other parts as many no longer exist
after 10,000 hours of building plane from scratch this week they put the final touches to the 20ft long aircraft
it is due to fly in spring 2015 and over @entity70 on july 1 , 2016 to mark 100 years since 20,000 died in @entity74
the aircraft will be the only flyable @entity14 anywhere in the world when it finally takes off
@entity15 brother 's were helped by friend @entity44 , and say their grandfather would be proud of them
