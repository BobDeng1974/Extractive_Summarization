as recently as march @entity0 addressed his @entity2 chances as a welterweight might think about beating a fighter of heavyweight class ; hopeful , but not investing too much faith			1
the @entity8 midfielder , a big boxing fan , had just scored a delightful back - heeled winner against @entity10 but in typically humble , matter - of - fact manner rowed back from suggestions that @entity13 could come calling			1
‘ it ’s every players ’ ambition to represent their country , ’ said @entity0 back then			1
‘ but i think i might be a bit away from that			2
there seems to be a lot of quality midfield players who are @entity23 who are above me at the minute			2
i ’ll keep grafting and maybe one day			2
’ big day : @entity0 will make his first start for @entity2 when they take on @entity27 on monday night progress : @entity0 ( second right ) made his debut for @entity13 's side in the win over @entity33 last week @entity34 hardened : @entity0 played the last 20 minutes against @entity33 as @entity2 laboured to a 1 - 0 victory that day has arrived quicker than he anticipated			1
after a promising cameo to win his first cap against @entity33 at @entity38 , @entity0 is set to start in @entity27 as @entity2 begin their @entity40 qualifying campaign			1
the retirements of @entity42 and @entity43 edged the door open , while @entity46 ’s injury has widened it further			1
@entity0 , who may still play even if the @entity48 man recovers in time , is ready to stride through			1
it may seem like a remarkably quick rise to an important role but the @entity53 - born midfielder , 24 , has been earmarked for international honours ever since his days as a teenage starter at @entity56			2
it was there he would kick @entity59 during early training sessions – ‘ he ’d go crazy , speaking in @entity62 to me			2
i learnt a few words i ca n’t use ’ – and there he scored an outrageous goal from near the half - way line against @entity67 in december 2008			2
@entity68 came close to signing @entity0 but ultimately it was @entity70 who paid an initial £ 6million to take him to @entity8 in 2009			1
just eight months later he ruptured the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee and was out for nearly a year			2
during that time he constantly questioned those treating him to the point where he is now called @entity76 by team - mates			0
‘ i like to know what ’s wrong with me			0
i do n’t just want to sit on the couch like a potato , ’ he says			0
@entity0 ’s game was put back though and little more than 18 months ago @entity8 fans wondered about his impact on the team			1
but his resilience and talent saw him emerge and once fully fit he became the engine of @entity91 ’s midfield , winning the club ’s player of the year award last season			2
flying in : @entity0 impressed as a teenager at @entity56 having joined from @entity53 as a youth player young gun : @entity0 spent three years at @entity56 before moving to @entity8 where he took time to establish himself a thunderous goal at @entity99 was the highlight , yet it was his energy , work - rate , and positive passing that helped @entity8 arrest a slide that at one stage looked like it might end in relegation			1
this summer he took only one week off before employing a personal trainer to increase his strength			0
‘ the start of my career was dreadful , ’ @entity0 admits			1
‘ probably the worst injury you can get in football is your anterior cruciate ligament , i also did my lateral meniscus , and my medial as well			0
it ’s been a tough road			0
’ there were long journeys in childhood too			0
@entity0 grew up in a council estate with little money and would travel a six - hour round trip to training at @entity56			1
single mum @entity126 raised him and remains his inspiration			0
‘ we never had a car so we would get three buses and a train , ’ he says			0
‘ my mum ’s a massive influence , a great lady , a hard woman			0
she would n’t let me come with any excuses			0
’ such an upbringing has formed @entity0 ’s character both on and off the pitch			1
in interviews he answers straight and thoughtfully and often with northern humour			0
in midfield he is robust , but refined			0
the late tackles have become less frequent but there is an edge to his style			0
@entity147 may provide @entity149 opposition and is aware of @entity0 ’s ability			1
' he will bring his energy , his power , his will to move forward all the time , ’ says the @entity8 defender			1
for the past months @entity0 has been getting acquainted with fatherhood alongside partner @entity157 as they raise baby girl @entity159			1
such maturity is bound to have an impact on his profession			0
he adds : ‘ you never forget where you come from			0
i would n’t change anything from when i was a young lad			0
you learn a few things when you ’re that age ; to strive for better			0
’ club call : @entity0 's impressive form for @entity8 earned him a call - up to the @entity2 squad agony : @entity0 reacts after missing a chance during @entity8 's 2 - 1 win over @entity176 this season			1

earlier this year , @entity0 was *unsure* if he would play for @entity2
@entity42 and @entity43 retiring has opened the door
midfielder is finally beginning to *fulfill* his potential at @entity8
