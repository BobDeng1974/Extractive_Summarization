father @entity0 claims @entity1 abused him during a game of hide - and - seek in 1983 a father allegedly abused by @entity1 has called for the top legal official who decided against prosecuting him to step down			1
@entity5 , director of public prosecutions , concluded dementia made the 86 - year - old unfit to plead			1
last night , one of the nine victims who had been lined up to give evidence against the former @entity11 mp waived his right to anonymity to say the decision ‘ beggars belief ’ – and claimed it points to an establishment cover - up			2
@entity0 , 47 , said he was unable to trust adults after being molested by @entity1 during a game of hide - and - seek in a park , when he was a 15 - year - old resident of a children ’s home			1
but he added that the failure to prosecute the peer for a fourth time – three inquiries were curtailed by police or the @entity28 – was a ‘ complete travesty ’			1
the father - of - three said he turned to drugs as a result of the abuse , which left him ‘ questioning myself and everyone around me ’			1
he believes @entity1 was ‘ steered ’ in his direction by the care home ’s manager , @entity37 – a friend who would later be convicted of a string of child sex offences			1
he added : ‘ i do n’t think anybody other than the victims and the police involved in the @entity45 inquiry understand how perverted a man @entity1 is			2
' he has blighted my life … how can they [ the @entity28 ] publicise the fact that there was enough evidence to charge , yet then say it is not in the public interest to pursue it ? ’ mr @entity0 , of @entity55 , @entity56 , added : ‘ no disrespect to the public , but what about the interest of the victims ? ‘ as far as i ’m concerned , her [ mrs @entity5 ’s ] actions are barely any less perverse than the abuse inflicted upon me as a teenager			1
she should initiate an inquiry into her own conduct and then step down because @entity5 certainly has n’t been doing her job properly			0
’ mr @entity0 said the decision not to prosecute @entity1 ( left ) , who he claims abused him when he was aged 15 , for the fourth time was a ' complete travesty '			1
@entity5 ( right ) said her job as head of the @entity28 was to make the correct legal decisions in difficult cases , not the most popular ones he said the police involved in the inquiry were ‘ blameless ’ but added that ‘ when one considers this is the fourth time @entity1 has been investigated , i honestly think there could be a cover - up at play ’			1
@entity45 was set up two years ago and 25 victims accused the @entity84 peer			0
most lived in @entity56 children ’s homes between 1969 and 1988			2
the @entity28 last week said the ‘ core allegation ’ was that @entity1 befriended @entity37 to access children ‘ to allow him to perpetrate serious sexual offences ’ on them			1
the politician was first implicated during the 1991 trial of @entity37 , who ran the @entity95 children ’s home in @entity96			1
a victim told the court @entity1 regularly abused him			2
@entity37 was convicted of child abuse and rape charges			0
he died in jail in 1994			0
following @entity37 ’s conviction , @entity1 , then an mp , stood up in the @entity104 to vehemently deny any abuse , and the @entity28 decided not to take further action			1
but mr @entity0 , who spent ten months at @entity107 – where he was twice groped by @entity37 – said he firmly believes the men were acting together to abuse children			2
he was placed in care aged 15 for ‘ rebellious behaviour ’ and said he met @entity1 in 1983 while playing arcade games at @entity114 service station			1
the peer called him by name , he said , even though ‘ i did n’t know him ’ and gave him some coins			0
mr @entity0 said over the next seven months @entity1 came to the service station seven times , sometimes discussing a hotel where they could go for ‘ steak and whisky ’			1
it was amid a game of hide - and - seek in @entity126 , @entity56 , organised by @entity37 later that year , that he claims he was abused by the peer			1
‘ i was just moving behind a gorse bush to hide when i saw @entity1 walking towards me , ’ he said			1
‘ he sat down beside me … then he abused me			0
it was indecent touching but he wanted it to go further … it lasted no more than 30 minutes , but it felt like an eternity			0
’ mr @entity0 believes @entity37 ‘ tipped @entity1 off about where to find me ’			1
he did not report the abuse to police and only realised who @entity1 was when he saw the mp ’s picture in a newspaper five years later			0
he added : ‘ the fact that @entity1 has been able to stand up in @entity142 and deny abusing children , then carry on with his gilded life is beyond comprehension			2
’ legal chief facing growing calls to quit : backlash against top prosecutor grows as she is accused of ignoring victims and claims of a establishment cover - up the furious backlash against the @entity155 ’s top prosecutor intensified last night over her decision to spare @entity1 from the dock			1
the position of director of public prosecutions @entity5 looked increasingly fragile as she faced growing calls to stand down			0
campaigners , police chiefs and mps accused her of ignoring the rights of victims and failing to clear the stench of an @entity168 cover - up that lingers over the case			0
and even her one of her predecessors said the horrific allegations should have been resolved in the ‘ full public glare of a courtroom ’ rather than her @entity176 office			0
mrs @entity5 fought back saying it is her job as the head of the @entity28 to make ‘ very difficult decisions ’ which are not necessarily popular			1
campaigners , police chiefs and mps have accused @entity5 , the director of the @entity28 ( above ) , of ignoring the rights of victims and failing to clear the stench of an @entity168 cover - up that lingers overhead but the row showed no sign of abating as further details of the claims levelled against the 86 - year - old @entity84 life @entity189 were made public			1
the decision not to charge @entity1 last week despite evidence of 22 offences against nine victims was justified because mrs @entity5 said experts agreed that the former @entity11 mp was in such poor health due to advanced @entity196			1
but she also ruled that he should have been charged three times before in 1991 , 2002 and 2007 but was left off the hook			0
the top @entity199 blamed police and prosecutors and launched in independent review , but her comments stoked fears that @entity1 is the beneficiary of a wholesale cover - up			0
yesterday , calls were growing for a judicial review of her decision , something which @entity210 has said it is already considering			0
@entity211 , the @entity84 mp who exposed @entity212 , said the weight of criticism against mrs @entity5 suggested something has ‘ clearly gone very badly wrong ’			2
he said : ‘ mrs @entity5 is now seen as a roadblock to justice and it ’s hard to see how her position remains tenable			2
’ criticism of mrs @entity5 began with comments from the home secretary , who has already been lobbied by senior police chiefs , when she said is ‘ very concerned ’			2
@entity224 said : ‘ i have been very clear in everything i have said so far about the child sex abuse issue – i expect to see justice done			0
’ she was joined by former @entity228 who said a ‘ trial of the facts ’ should have been considered			0
this would have enabled a jury to decide the facts without apportioning guilt and without a sentence being passed – offering a chance for victims to be heard			0
@entity238 said : ‘ it might have been wiser for the @entity28 to say ‘ we ’re going to have this matter resolved in the full public glare of a courtroom rather than simply by the @entity243			0
’ further questions also emerged about the true state of @entity1 ’s health as it was revealed he wrote to the @entity248 just a fortnight ago to extend his role			2
the politician , who has claimed tens of thousands of pounds in expenses in recent years , took a formal leave of absence last october			0
when asked if he would consider retiring when the election was called , he responded in a personally signed letter received on april 9 asking to continue in office			0
experts said victims may now be denied the opportunity to sue @entity1 because none of the claims have been proven			0
@entity261 said : ‘ a finding that the acts took place may have consequences for the defendant , particularly one who has the benefit of an honour from the @entity269			0
’ mrs @entity5 has also come under fire over other high - profile cases , including the first disastrous attempt for a conviction for female genital mutilation and the pursuit of journalists .			2
