by @entity0 published : 11:30 est , 24 october 2012 updated : 11:49 est , 24 october 2012 five horses found bony , diseased and malnourished have been rescued from a @entity4 farm three months after authorities say their owner was warned to take better care of them			1
found 153 to 333 pounds underweight suffering now long - term dental and other health problems , the horses ' discovery came after @entity14 officers in @entity15 received an anonymous call last week reporting their dangerous conditions			1
the four mares and single gelding between four and 14 years of age were removed from the farm last wednesday			0
it was only last july according to the @entity14 that the owner was ordered to provide nutritional and dental care for the horses			1
the owner complied with that order to seek veterinary care and received a specific nutrition plan to put the horses on a path of recovery , @entity14 major @entity39 told @entity47			2
they failed to follow the plan , however , with officials now finding the horses each 153 , 203 , 308 , 315 , and 333 pounds underweight			2
diseased : in addition to being found malnourished , the horses also suffered rain rot , a skin disease that causes their coats to develop scabs and lesions starved : the horses were each found 153 , 203 , 308 , 315 , and 333 pounds underweight , their hip bones and rib cages easily visible moving forward : once the animals ' health is improved they will be up for adoption while their owner faces numerous animal cruelty charges seen with spotted coats , they also had developed rain rot , a skin disease that causes a matted coat and bumps that can escalate to scabs and lesions			1
when more healthy their dental problems will also require anesthesia , said @entity74			0
once that is complete they will be available for adoption			0
