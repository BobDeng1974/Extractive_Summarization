twenty minutes remained and the match was effectively over when the home side assembled a string of short passes			1
ironic ‘ @entity9 ’s ! ’ echoed around the raucous old ground , followed by a chant of ‘ @entity6 — we ’re coming for you ! ’ @entity10 may be fourth at @entity11 and @entity12 may be distantly beckoning , but their fans retain a decent sense of reality			1
despite the propaganda from the usual channels , @entity16 is not yet a haven for purists			0

click here for our brilliant @entity77			0
the ball is still pumped urgently from front to back , fresh air is routinely preferred to green grass , and @entity22 ’s head is the target for the booming bulk of their attacking intentions			1
but the side is big , muscular , well - drilled and efficient			1
and it is currently fourth			2
for the moment , at least , the fans will settle for such unusual eminence			0
last night ’s celebrations were suitably clamorous			0
‘ bubbles ’ rang out like an anthem of triumph , backs were slapped and the air was punched in exaltation			0
it was one more scalp of a spectacular winter			0
fine goals from @entity22 and @entity39 maintained a run which has seen just one @entity10 defeat in 11 games			1
@entity48 struck an untypically exultant note			1
‘ we ’ve got to enjoy the moment for as long as it last , ’ he said			0
‘ hopefully , it will last for a good while yet			0
’ then caution took over : ‘ the end of january will tell us what we could possibly achieve			0
it ’s about consistency of winning			0
you ca n’t afford to slip			0
but at the moment , we ’re enjoying it ’			0
@entity22 is congratulated by @entity10 player @entity118 after his first half strike the scenes of delirium continue after @entity22 's 24th minute opener gives the home side the perfect start in @entity125 @entity23 is left grasping at thin air as @entity39 doubles @entity10 's advantage shortly after the break @entity39 salutes the @entity16 faithful after his 55th minute strike put @entity10 firmly in control @entity24 had played the prettier , more precise football , but their finishing was inadequate and their physical challenge fell far short of that required of sides which come up against such a massed physical presence			1
their position grows more precarious each week and , short of spectacular investment in the transfer window , survival is looking increasingly like a distant dream			0
in fairness , they had appeared comfortable in the opening stages , moving the ball easily and intelligently , making the half - chances , generally looking the more confident side , despite their perilous position			1
@entity10 could offer @entity38 to counter in kind , with his own thoughtful , considered approach			2
@entity38 , alongside the impressive @entity39 , gives them a dimension beyond the purely physical , and yesterday both men contributed richly			1
it was @entity39 who choreographed @entity22 ’s first chance in the 22nd minute , when he cut back a cross from the goal – line			1
@entity22 , perhaps startled by a ball approaching less than eight feet off the ground , lifted the offering high into the stand			2
but his chance of redemption was presented almost immediately			0
@entity24 were attacking with some intent when the ball was hacked out of @entity10 ’s area			1
@entity52 , once a @entity10 player , attempted a ludicrous back pass from half way , wide out on the touchline			1
ineptly hit , the ball coasted into the path of @entity22 , who strode on unopposed and casually chipped the advancing @entity23			2
@entity39 celebrates with @entity22 and @entity30 after he doubled @entity10 's advantage @entity10 's medical staff attend to @entity22 after the @entity10 forward crashed into the photographer 's pit during the game @entity22 ( right ) is in the thick of the action again as he competes for possession with @entity50 it was the kind of finish which breaks fragile hearts , and we could see @entity24 ’s shoulders sagging at such a self – imposed handicap			1
things did not improve for @entity68 ’s side			1
in 32 minutes , @entity59 was booked for a reckless tackle , and two minutes later @entity54 discovered @entity24 ’s best chance , snapping a fierce drive at the top corner , and seeing it instinctively parried by @entity29 in the @entity10 goal			1
before half time , @entity60 was harshly booked for flinging a tackle at @entity38			2
without ever looking truly convincing , @entity10 found themselves in command at the interval , while @entity24 , for all the shrewd subtleties of @entity55 , had supplied a good many reasons for their present predicament			1
but the tone was raised by a tremendous goal in 56 minutes			0
the prologue was familiar , with yet another ball pumped high to the edge of the @entity24 area and @entity205 winning the header			2
it fell to @entity39 , 20 yards out , and he glanced up , arranged his feet and curved a measured drive beyond @entity23			2
it was , by some distance , the most elegantly effective manoeuvre of the match			0
@entity24 forward @entity60 ( left ) goes head - to - head with @entity10 's @entity215 defender @entity33 @entity22 ( left ) displays his aerial prowess once more as wins a header in @entity24 's penalty area @entity10 midfielder @entity38 ( second left ) drives forward as @entity24 forward @entity56 watches on @entity10 manager @entity48 ( right ) watches proceedings from the touchline along with @entity24 boss @entity68 ( left ) @entity24 ’s retaliation was meagre , largely limited to a self – made , self – wasted chance from the substitute @entity61			1
but @entity10 had deserved their security , just as they deserve their current status			2
there is a long , long way to go , and many a plot will unfold			0
with @entity233 and @entity234 next up , their credentials will be thoroughly tested			0
but , for the moment , @entity10 have sound cause for celebration			2
“ enjoy the moment ’ , @entity48 exhorted			2
the strains of @entity240 , bellowed over and over through the chill december evening , revealed that his instructions were being faithfully obeyed			0
in this part of @entity125 , it prmises to be the happiest of @entity245 .			0

@entity22 fired @entity10 into the lead in the first half with his third goal since returning from *injury*
@entity39 doubled the home side 's advantage shortly after the break to put @entity10 in control
the @entity10 hold on to fourth place in the @entity258 going into @entity11
@entity48 's men have lost just once in 11 games and remain firmly in contention for a top - four finish
@entity24 remain rooted to the bottom of the @entity258 table and have not won since *september*
the @entity269 ' *winless* run extends to 12 matches and @entity68 's side are in deep *relegation* *trouble*
