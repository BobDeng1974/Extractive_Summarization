the state @entity11 ruled last wednesday to terminate @entity13 ’s parental rights and return three - year - old @entity14 to adoptive parents @entity15 and @entity17 who had looked after the girl from birth until 19 months ago when they were forced to hand her over to her biological father			1
but @entity13 , who previously secured custody based on his @entity23 ancestry , now has several @entity25 special interest groups - the @entity26 , the @entity27 and the @entity28 - working to fight the court ’s decision			1

in the middle of the increasingly complex custody battle , @entity13 has released a photograph of him together with his daughter taken on monday before he had to leave for mandatory @entity57 training			0
@entity15 and @entity17 were in the delivery room when @entity14 was born in @entity59 in september 2009 ' the decision contributes to the long and sordid history of @entity25 children being removed from their families without any consideration of their best interests , ' said @entity66 , the executive director of the @entity27			1
@entity13 also has gone before a @entity23 court to have other family members declared joint guardians of @entity14 , including his wife , @entity71 , and his parents , @entity73 and @entity74			2
last wednesday the state @entity11 ruled in a 3:2 decision that the @entity36 are the only party properly seeking to adopt @entity14 in @entity5 and ordered a @entity77 to finalize the couple 's adoption			1

' we also want to thank everyone who has supported us throughout this ordeal			0

' @entity5 courts originally said the 1978 @entity101 — a federal law intended to keep @entity42 children from being taken from their homes and typically placed with @entity106 adoptive or foster parents — favored her living with her biological father			1
a member of the @entity23 , @entity13 had never met his daughter and , after the girl 's @entity106 mother rebuffed his marriage proposal , played no role during the pregnancy and paid no child support after the girl was born			2
@entity14 , her biological father @entity13 , feed their geese and ducks at his home in @entity59 where she has lived for the past 19 months but when @entity13 found out @entity14 was going to be adopted , he objected and said the law favored the girl living with him and growing up learning tribal traditions			1
@entity13 took custody in 2011 and has been living with his daughter in @entity59 since then			0
but the @entity36 — who were present at the girl 's birth and even cut her umbilical cord raised @entity14 for the first 27 months of her life — appealed that decision to the @entity87 @entity11			1
last month , the nation 's high court ruled that @entity5 courts should decide who gets to adopt the girl , a determination the state court made yesterday			2
' we think the @entity11 plainly contemplated an expeditious resolution of this case , and we believe the facts of this case require it , ' the @entity5 high court wrote , ordering a @entity77 to finalize the @entity36 ' adoption and to terminate @entity13 's parental rights			1
' there is absolutely no need to compound any suffering that @entity154 may experience through continued litigation			0

' as you can imagine , we are shocked and saddened at this development , ' @entity162 , a @entity5 - based attorney for @entity13 , wrote in an email			2
' there is no mention , or apparent consideration , in the majority decision of the child 's best interest , as the dissenters point out			0
' separately , justices @entity174 and @entity176 wrote that , while the case 's details should be hammered out in @entity77 , the transfer of the girl should be handled delicately so as to be least disruptive to her			0
' the majority orders the immediate transfer of the child , no longer an infant or toddler , upon the filing of the family court 's adoption order , without regard to whether such an abrupt transfer would be in the child 's best interest , ' the two justices wrote			0
' this is a situation where the decisions that are in the best interests of this child , given all that has happened in her short life , must be sorted out in the lower court ( s )			0
