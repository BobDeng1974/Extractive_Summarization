by @entity0 published : 05:45 est , 28 february 2013 updated : 06:54 est , 28 february 2013 a major privacy row has broken out over technology that can ' listen in ' to phone calls and work out what mood the participants are in			1
@entity6 , owner of the @entity9 network in @entity10 , says it is developing the technology so customers can ' learn about themselves '			1
however , experts have warned it could be used to sell advertising more effectively - and say it is a ' huge risk ' to consumers			1
how are you feeling ? @entity6 has developed software that can listen in on calls and work out what mood speakers are in this week @entity6 boasted the technology is ' 80 % accurate ' as it revealed the system in a secret meeting at the @entity26 exhibition in @entity27			1
a team of engineers and psychologists in @entity6 's @entity27 research facility has built a working version , although so far they have only tested it on internal volunteers			1
the firm claims it can only analyse a tone of voice , and not work out what is being said			0
' this is a proof of concept that our innovation lab has been working on to empower people with their own data to see what it says about them , ' a spokesman said			0
' there are no plans to commercialise this and absolutely no intention of offering this information to advertisers			0
' however , experts say the technology is likely to be seen as extremely lucrative to advertisers - and warned it could be a huge risk to consumer 's privacy			1
@entity58 , director of privacy campaign group @entity59 , said : ' it might sound futuristic but voice analysis , like facial recognition technology , poses a huge risk to people ’s privacy because it ’s easy to use without people knowing			1
' if it is ever turned on , this must be an opt - in system , with people fully aware of who will be able to see these psychological profiles and what purpose they are being drawn up for			2
' we ’re seeing an arms race between all kinds of companies to gather as much data on their customers – indeed anyone they can – as fast as possible and ultimately the real motivation is likely to be corporate profits , not consumer benefit			0
mobile giant @entity6 , which owns @entity9 in the @entity10 , has been working with psychologists to develop the controversial software ' the question is whether consumers are willing to tolerate this kind of intrusive monitoring for slightly better targeted advertisements or spurious service changes			1
' i expect most people will be strongly against the privacy of their calls being intruded upon in this way			2
' @entity97 , a consumer analyst at @entity99 , said the privacy concerns may make it impossible for the system to ever be launched			2
‘ consumers are increasingly concerned about how their personal data is exploited , which in turn is reflected by mounting regulatory scrutiny of this issue , ' she said			0
‘ @entity99 believes that a commercial launch for the project is likely to be challenging			0
' @entity6 ’s linguistic analysis engine provides a deep level of granularity , even without listening to actual conversations , and we think that consumers will be very uncomfortable and resistant to the idea			2
' she believes the system could be used in a similar way to @entity121 's controversial @entity120 , which ' mines ' a user 's profile for information			0
' while @entity127 has the search graph and @entity121 has the social graph , @entity126 says that it has the voice graph , ' she said			0
' this level of insight would clearly be of interest to advertisers and organizations in sectors such as tourism			0

@entity6 - owner of @entity9 - revealed technology that will ' listen in ' on calls
it analyses voice tones - and could be used to target adverts
privacy campaigners say the proposed system is a ' huge risk '
