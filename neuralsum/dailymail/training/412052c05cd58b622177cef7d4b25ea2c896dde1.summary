by @entity0 @entity1 have officially completed the signing of @entity3 forward @entity4 on a season - long loan			1
the @entity7 striker passed a medical on friday after the two clubs agreed a deal , which includes the option to buy permanently , earlier in the week and the paperwork has now been finalised			0
@entity4 , 26 , moved to @entity13 from @entity14 last summer but had a disappointing season and made just 15 appearances , the majority as a substitute , and scored one goal			0
unhappy stay : @entity4 failed to break into the starting line - up after his £ 9m move to @entity3 heading home : the @entity7 striker managed just one goal in his season at the club the forward cost @entity3 £ 9million last year , but failed to adapt to a lack of playing time and the @entity31 weather during his season at @entity13			2
' my experience in the @entity37 was fabulous on a collective level , but on an individual level it was very hard for me , because i went from playing all the time to not playing at all , ' he told @entity7 radio station @entity41 short stay : @entity43 will join @entity1 on a season - long loan , with the possibility of a permanent deal ' even though people say @entity48 are used to seeing clouds in the sky and a similar climate to the one in @entity3 , once you return here you treasure @entity7 a lot more			1
' i hope i can adapt and climatise to @entity1 as quickly as possible			0
