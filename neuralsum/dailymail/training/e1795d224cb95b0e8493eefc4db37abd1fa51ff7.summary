@entity11 dark ale spreadable beer has just launched in @entity12 and also promises to provide a unique accompaniment for hors d'oeuvres and cheeses - and , say its makers , can even be used as a garnish for tarts and cakes			1
the beer spread contains a whopping 40 per cent actual beer and is suitable for spreading on toast beer lovers can now enjoy their favourite tipple in new and exciting ways thanks to the ingenious collaboration between an @entity28 chocolate maker and an @entity28 beer brewer			1
the result is a sweet and beer - perfumed jelly with an intense scent and a full - bodied taste			2
@entity34 , @entity12 director of food comments ' spreadable beer was chosen due to its quirky properties , but also because it tastes delicious ! ' it has the perfect composition using high quality ingredients , it might be an acquired taste , but for beer lovers out there it is perfect			1
' there are two varieties , one is more delicate like an ipa and the other is similar to an ale with an intense scent and a full - bodied taste			2
' @entity11 dark ale spreadable beer is made of 40 per cent and comes in a 280g jar for £ 7.99			1
the omens were n’t good			0
as i twisted open the jar , i caught a whiff of post-midnight pub : stale , yeasty and a bit dirty			2
it looked pretty innocuous though – gravy - hued jelly with one or two tiny bubbles marring the smooth surface			0
but if it looked ok , it certainly did n’t taste it			0
instead , i got a pint of real ale with half a bag of sugar stirred in – a sort of beery jam , if you will			0
those who love beer and those who love sugary spreads but find @entity80 a bit much will enjoy it			0
it definitely has a future as a @entity86 stand - by at the very least			0
but if you ’re working out what to buy for me , please step away from the ale spread			1
@entity90 it certainly is n’t			0
