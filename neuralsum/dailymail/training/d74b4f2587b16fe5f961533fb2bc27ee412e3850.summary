by @entity0 published : 12:17 est , 21 june 2013 updated : 12:55 est , 21 june 2013 an undercover police officer who posed as an environmental activist reportedly co-wrote a libellous leaflet that attacked @entity4 ’s and triggered the longest civil trial in @entity7 history			1
one of the authors of the so - called @entity10 leaflet is former police officer @entity11 according to a book on undercover policing by @entity16 journalists @entity14 and @entity17			1
it is claimed in the book , which is released on monday , that @entity11 co-wrote the defamatory six - page leaflet in 1986 - and his role in its production has been the subject of an internal @entity24 investigation for several months			1
@entity11 pictured in the 1980s ( left ) and more recently ( right )			1
he is accused of having co-written the leaflet that led to the @entity10 case mr @entity11 is said to have used the alias @entity28 during his five years infiltrating the @entity30 group , when he was with the special demonstration squad ( @entity32 ) , a now - disbanded @entity34 unit that targeted political activists			1
@entity4 ’s famously sued two green campaigners over the leaflet in a landmark three - year high court case , that was widely considered to have been a public relations disaster for the corporation			2
however it was never suggested during the costly civil legal proceedings brought by @entity45 in the 1990s that an undercover police officer helped write the leaflet			1
mr @entity11 ( wearing a red jacket ) attends a protest during the period he infiltrated @entity30 a raft of allegations have been made against undercover police in recent months including claims officers used dead children ’s identities and that some had sexual relationships with the targets of their operations			1
mr @entity11 now works as a lecturer in terrorism studies at the @entity62 , in @entity63			1
an investigation into undercover policing , called @entity66 , has been launched by the @entity67			0
@entity10 and @entity10 were sued by the @entity45 corporation after they published a leaflet attacking the company @entity72 police chief constable @entity71 was brought in to oversee the operation and recently confirmed it was ' common practice ' for undercover officers within the @entity32 to use dead children ’s identities			1
a statement from the @entity34 said the force ' recognises the seriousness of the allegations of inappropriate behaviour and practices involving past undercover deployments '			2
it said : ' @entity66 is a live investigation , four strands of which are being supervised by the @entity88 , and it would be inappropriate to pre-judge its findings			0
' the @entity34 must balance the genuine public interest in these matters with its duty to protect officers and former officers who have been deployed undercover , often in difficult and dangerous circumstances			0
' we are therefore not prepared to confirm nor deny the identity of individuals alleged in the media to have been working undercover , nor confirm nor deny the deployment of individuals on specific operations			2
the case became the longest running civil case in @entity7 history and only ended when the pair took it to the @entity108 ' it is also important to recognise that any actions by officers working on or with the @entity32 need to be understood by @entity66 in terms of the leadership , supervision , support , training , legal framework , tasking and reporting mechanisms that were in place at the time			1
' at some point it will fall upon this generation of police leaders to account for the activities of our predecessors , but for the moment we must focus on getting to the truth			2
' mr @entity11 has also admitted that he tricked an innocent woman into having an 18 - month relationship with him to apparently bolster his cover story			1
he started dating the woman in the 1980s as he infiltrated @entity30 to get into the hardline @entity135			0
@entity136 & @entity10 , known as ‘ the mclibel case ’ , was a lawsuit filed by @entity136 against activists @entity10 and @entity10 in1997			1
beginning in 1986 , @entity30 , a small environmental campaigning group , distributed a pamphlet entitled what ’s wrong with @entity4 ’s : everything they do n’t want you to know			0
the leaflet accused the @entity136 of unethical practices this publication made a number of allegations against @entity4 's			1
the leading allegations were that @entity4 's : lasting ten years , it became the longest running civil suit in @entity7 history			1
despite @entity4 's won in part two hearings of the case , they announced that they would not collect the £ 40,000 that was awarded to them			0
this was due to the partial nature of the victory , and that it was seen as a @entity167 style case			0
the judge in the original hearing confirmed many of the allegations made in the pamphlet were true			0
on appeal , two more claims made in the pamphlet were given credence by the courts			0
the @entity108 ( @entity108 ) ruled in @entity178 v @entity179 that the pair had been denied a fair trial , in breach of @entity183 and that their conduct should have been protected by @entity185 of the @entity186			2
the court awarded a judgment of £ 57,000 against the @entity179 government			0
the woman has admitted that she is still damaged by the experience			0
she told the @entity16 that she was convinced the romantic , polite and charismatic @entity11 was her ideal man - and had a long - term future with him			1
but 18 months into their relationship the decorated officer disappeared and told her he was moving to @entity197 because he feared being caught by the police			2
two @entity16 journalists allege that @entity11 was a co-writer of the @entity10 leaflet she told the @entity16 : ' i was cruelly tricked and it has made me very angry			1
i am actually quite damaged by the whole thing			0
i am still not over it			0
' having a partner that believed his cover story meant that @entity11 could infiltrate the group more easily			2
the former officer told the website @entity210 in a response to their open letter : ' i apologise unreservedly for the deception i therefore practiced on law abiding members of @entity30			2
' i also apologise unreservedly for forming false friendships with law abiding citizens and in particular forming a long term relationship with ( the woman ) who had every reason to think i was a committed animal rights activist and a genuine @entity30 campaigner			0
' he added : ' i should point out here that the vast majority of @entity34 special branch undercover officers never made the mistakes i made , have no need to apologise for anything , and i deeply regret having tarnished their illustrious , professional reputation			0
' my deceptions in the 1980s were all premised on maintaining the fiction required to perform my undercover role			0
' in the late 1990s , mr @entity11 became head of the @entity32 and was responsible for placing police moles in political organisations			1
from 2002 to 2007 , he was in charge of @entity24 's @entity243 , tasked with preventing @entity245 extremism by way of two - way dialogue with the @entity243 community			0
since 2006 , he has lectured at @entity249 and @entity251 's universities .			0
