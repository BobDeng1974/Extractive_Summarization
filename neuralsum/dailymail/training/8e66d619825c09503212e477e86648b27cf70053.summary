by @entity0 published : 11:50 est , 19 october 2012 updated : 14:42 est , 19 october 2012 worth it ? this 1934 @entity3 coat sold for £ 20,400 - 100 times its expected price even the auctioneer admits you could pick up something similar in a charity shop for under £ 50			1
but this ' moth - eaten ' 1934 men ’s fake fur coat fetched a world record £ 20,400 - 100 times its expected price - at auction after an extraordinary bout of ' bidding fever ' swept the sale room			1
unloved - and unworn - by its previous owner who was given it as a gift by his wife 20 years ago , the @entity3 beige mohair plush ' teddy ' coat was expected to fetch £ 200			1
but the estimate was far outstripped as , to the astonishment of the auctioneer and the joy of the seller , two vintage clothes loving men drove the price up and up during three minutes of breath - taking bidding			1
' it was bonkers , ' said fashion specialist auctioneer @entity34 , who sold the coat			1
' i was absolutely astounded			0
but we had two bidders who like to win and neither of them wanted to back down			0
' the bidding started at £ 200 and quickly reached £ 8,000			1
there was a lull while one of them had a think before it reached £ 12,000 , then another lull before it went to £ 17,000			1
' everyone in the room was shocked and you could hear a pin drop			0
when i finally brought the gavel down there was stunned silence then everyone burst out laughing			0
' there ’s a lot of interest in vintage clothing at the moment , but i never expected anything like this			1
' every now and then you just get these flights of madness when bidding fever sets in			2
common sense goes out the window and you have to prick yourself			0
i think there was probably a bit of machismo involved from the bidders too			0
' neither bidder attended the sale in @entity78 on tuesday , bidding by phone instead			2
details were released for the first time yesterday when the auctioneers declared it a world record			0
buyer and seller both requested anonymity from the auctioneers			2
all miss @entity34 would say of the mystery buyer is : ' he is competitive and has very deep pockets			1
and i hope he likes it - he has never seen it apart from in a photograph			0
moth eaten : the coat has visible holes and would have cost a couple of guineas - around £ 2.10 - when new bidding war : two vintage clothes loving men drove the price up during three minutes at auction ( posed by models ) ' to be honest , it ’s seen better days			1
it ’s a bit moth - eaten and the leather is falling off the buckle			0
it ’s the kind of thing you might find for £ 50 in a charity shop on a good day			2
’ @entity114 fashion retailer @entity3 was founded in 1900 when it opened its first shop in @entity78 and is known for its menswear , although it began selling women ’s ’ clothes too in the 1980s			1
the upmarket chain now has over 70 retail outlets			0
sold ! both the auctioneer and seller were shocked by how much the ' moth - eaten ' coat fetched ' @entity125 ' coats were all the rage in the 1930s when , despite the @entity129 , fashion was influenced by the escapist glamour of the ' golden age ' of @entity132			2
miss @entity34 estimated the coat would have cost ' a couple of guineas ' - or around £ 2.10 - when new			1
the seller , from @entity137 , had bought it second - hand for about £ 40			2
she likes vintage clothing and hoped her to get her husband to start wearing some too , said @entity143 , but he ' absolutely refused and never put it on '			2
it had been languishing in a wardrobe for the last two decades , the woman 's by now grown - up sons having also refused to wear it			0
miss @entity34 said the seller watched the auction live over the internet with members of her family who were ' jumping up and down ' as the bidding rose			0
' she is still in shock but is deliriously happy , ' she added			0
' she said it was a good job her husband had n’t liked it			0
' the final hammer price was £ 17,000			1
but with the auctioneers ' commission , the total paid for the coat was £ 20,400			1
thrown in with it in the same lot were two 1950s blazers and a red and white striped 1920s men 's bathing suit .			0
