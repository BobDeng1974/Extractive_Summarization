by @entity0 published : 06:51 est , 29 august 2012 updated : 19:10 est , 29 august 2012 gps could test whether drinkers are at risk of developing irrevesible liver damage a blood test that can spot hidden liver damage has been developed by @entity8 doctors			1
they hope it could soon be used by @entity1 to identify patients at risk of life - threatening liver disease before it is too late			1
the number of @entity8 dying from liver disease has reached record levels , up by a quarter in a decade to more than 11,500 a year			1
this is largely thought to be due to high levels of binge drinking and obesity			0
one reason liver disease is so dangerous is that it is very difficult to diagnose and patients may not have symptoms until the organ starts to fail			1
but a team of researchers from @entity28 claim their new blood test – more detailed and precise than existing tests – can successfully pinpoint patients at high risk			2
such patients could then be encouraged to reform their lifestyles or be put on medication			0
the ‘ traffic light ’ test analyses indicators in patients ’ blood , which will change if the liver has been damaged			2
it combines a routine liver test , already in use , with two others measuring the level of fibrosis , or scarring			2
patients are then given a colour based on their risk with red meaning it is high , amber intermediate and green low			0
the test has already been trialled on more than 1,000 patients with liver disease and researchers claim it was successfully able to pinpoint whether their liver was damaged			1
cirrhosis of the liver magnified : cirrhosis may not be accompanied by any symptoms which means the disease is not diagnosed until too late they hope that in future it will be routinely used by @entity1 on patients who drink heavily or those who are very overweight			2
dr @entity70 , who devised the test , said : ‘ it is a powerful tool and message for people			2
‘ we can say , “ @entity76 means we ca n’t be absolutely sure but there is at least a 50:50 chance that you have a scarred liver , and there is a significant possibility that you could die of it within 5 years ”			0
‘ we find that for most patients this is a pretty good stimulus to stop drinking or at least to cut down to safe levels			0
’ he said that liver disease ‘ develops silently ’ , adding : ‘ there are no signs or symptoms – the liver has no pain fibres until disease is very far advanced			1
powerful tool : dr @entity70 , left , devised the test which he says is a ' message for people ' to detect liver disease which ' may prove really useful ' according to prof sir @entity99 , right ‘ by the time the patient presents to hospital the liver is often very scarred			1
’ dr @entity103 , whose study is published in the @entity105 , said most patients were keen to take the test			0
‘ people are immensely curious about if their alcohol intake is doing any harm , ’ he said			0
study co-author and gp dr @entity113 said : ‘ the traffic light test has the advantage of highlighting those at highest risk who should be investigated further and those in whom the risk is much lower where a watchful approach is more appropriate			0
’ professor sir @entity99 , chair of the @entity123 , said : ‘ one of the challenges of liver disease , which is rising dramatically in this country , is the silent nature of the condition until it is often too late to reverse the damage			1
‘ this large study from @entity103 and colleagues in @entity28 may prove really useful for guiding the right patients towards specialist care in a timely way			0

liver disease develops silently and so it *remains* *undiagnosed* often until it is too late
a test developed by @entity8 doctors can successfully detect liver disease earlier
