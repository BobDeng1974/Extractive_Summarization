by @entity0 follow @ @ brianwlee1 a round up of some of the more unusual happenings from the final round of the @entity5 at @entity6			2
@entity7 day unluckiest shot of the early play ? that surely belonged to the @entity11 , who was three under par for his round when his tee shot to the par - three eighth hit the flagstick and bounced off the green			1
instead of a tap - in birdie he ran up a bogey			0
unlucky : @entity11 @entity11 saw his tee shot on the eighth rebound off the flagstick and roll off the green @entity23 hits hold - up spare a little sympathy for @entity26			1
in pursuit of joining sir @entity29 on six majors , he turned up at 9.30am for his 2.45pm tee - time , practised for over three hours … and then came the weather delay			1
still , it showed why the 44 - year - old has the greatest short game ever seen			0
game of patience : @entity26 pictured leaving the practice ground before the bad weather moved in quick code switch @entity40 changed his phone ’s passcode after being caught on @entity44 television tapping in 1256			2
what do the numbers stand for ? twelve majors and 56 victories by the time he ’s done ? @entity40 was n’t too stressed , tweeting ‘ @entity50 changed			0
now for some golf ’			0
passcode problems : @entity40 's phone pin was inadvertently broadcast on @entity44 television			1

@entity26 arrived at @entity6 at 9.30am for 2.45pm tee time
he practised for three hours before rain delayed his start
@entity40 's pin was *accidentally* broadcast by @entity44 tv
but @entity65 was *unfazed* and *won* *fourth* major by a single shot
@entity11 @entity11 suffered stroke of *misfortune* when tee shot on the eighth struck the flagstick
