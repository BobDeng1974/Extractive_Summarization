when @entity1 says his marriage was a lie , he is n't exaggerating			1
that 's because the @entity6 man just learned that his wife @entity7 was committing bigamy the nine years they were together , since she never divorced her last husband			1
@entity1 says he was supposed to be his wife 's fifth husband , and he fears he might not be her last			1
police have allegedly refused to charge @entity7 with bigamy and she is already listed as ' single ' on a free dating website , according to a report by @entity17			1
‘ what kind of dummy was i to get myself caught up in something like this ? ' @entity1 said			2
they hit it off and two years later , in 2006 , they tied the knot			0
but the marriage did n't last and last year the couple filed for divorcee			2
it was during their legal battle that @entity1 hired private investigator @entity45 , who discovered @entity24 's marital secret			1
‘ i started looking for the divorce file from husband number four			0
i could n't find it			0
' i said : " did you two ever get divorced ? " he said : " no " '			0
that revelation quickly brought the divorce proceedings to an end , with a judge ruling a ' consent judgement ' declaring the @entity59 ' marriage void			1
getting back in the game : apparently @entity7 is already listed on a free dating website as ' single ' even its believed she is still married to her fourth husband while @entity1 says many people find the situation humorous , he finds it hard to laugh			1
when asked how he considers the years he spent in a false marriage , @entity1 responds : ' wasted '			2
' there was some good , just not the marriage part , ' he said			0
‘ you`d never be able to convince me it was an innocent mistake			0
’ and to add insult in injury , @entity1 says local police have refused to arrest his ex-wife for bigamy based on the fact that there is a statue of limitations of only one year for bigamy and his marriage was nine years ago			1
however , such cases have been prosecuted in the area before , based on the time the bigamy was discovered			0
in this case , it was just a few months ago			0
@entity1 also says that his ex-wife continues to live in their former home , even though he is the owner and his name is on the title .			2

@entity1 married @entity24 nine years ago
the two filed for divorce last year , and that 's when @entity1 realized his wife never divorced from her last husband
a judge ended their divorce proceedings by voiding the marriage
he says local police have refused to charge his now ex-wife with bigamy and that she refused to leave the home he owns
@entity24 has allegedly already set up a *profile* on a free dating site , listing herself as ' single '
