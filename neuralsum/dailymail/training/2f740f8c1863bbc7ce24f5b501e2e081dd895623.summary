an ice epidemic is sweeping through @entity1 and destroying regional towns as children as young as 11 become hooked on the deadly drug from their first hit			1
a @entity8 investigation has revealed there are now almost 350,000 @entity1 taking cheap , easily accessible and highly addictive crystal methamphetamine , nicknamed ice , which destroys the brain and creates psychotic behaviour such as users gauging away at their skin as they imagine feeling insects crawling beneath it			1
the @entity20 ’s current affairs show has met with ice users , ice cooks , police and recovering addicts in @entity25 and @entity26 , who painted a disturbing picture : international drug cartels are working with local bikie gangs to push ice out of the cities , and police are losing the battle to stop it			1
‘ these addicts have the battle scars , there was a man who has ripped out all of his teeth with pliers , people pick away at their teeth , gums and skin , ’ reporter @entity34 told @entity35			1
he became so paranoid he could n't look in the mirror the ravaged physical appearance of those consumed by the drug shocked @entity34 and so did the age of the people she encountered			1
she said ‘ sitting down with a young crystal meth cook ’ who tried ice at 13 and was cooking by 15 horrified her the most			1
‘ he was cooking without any protection , no suits – this is n’t @entity65 … at just 19 - years - old his body was falling apart already , his joints pop out of place , he is riddled with early onset arthritis , he ’s vomiting blood , paralysed by muscles aches			1
‘ his brain has suddenly changed , he is very sick and probably wo n’t live very long , ’ @entity34 explained			1
she discovered that ‘ young and desperate ’ kids from broken homes , often lonely and with great responsibilities to provide for their families , were being targeted by outlaw motorcycle gangs to do their dirty work - dealing and cooking ice for other bored teenagers in country towns			0
one woman 's ice addiction led her to start rummaging through bins every day in 2006 , the @entity85 program showed @entity86 ' after using ice			0
she was obsessed with rubbish @entity34 explained that the people who agreed to open up on camera - such as 17 - year - old @entity91 who left school after an older man injected him with ice and joined a crystal meth pack of fellow young addicts , stealing from people to feed their addiction - did so because they want to show people the dangers			1
they want to show that it ’s not just junkies who are involved , it 's young people with promising futures who are ruining their lives with the drug			1
‘ park that judgement and put that aside … we are spending time with young people who started using when they were 15 and 13 , older men putting needles in their arms … their ’s are tales of absolute self - destruction			1
’ teenage user @entity91 said of his desperation to get more ice : ‘ @entity121 locked the door on me and i remember thinking ... if i get in there i will hurt her for money			0
i will get money out of her one way or another			0
’ children as young as 11 are using ice and being signed up as dealers by bikie gangs this photo shows the huge amount of the drugs seized by @entity134 in just one ice bust this year @entity134 found a huge factory producing ice and cops have stressed it 's a ' very very big issue for @entity1 in 2014 ' when people take ice the dopamine levels in the brain shoot up from 100 units to over 1000 , something that 's about 12 times as much of a release of dopamine as you get from naturally pleasurable activities such as food and sex			1
‘ @entity152 sustained use your brain stops producing naturally so you really became no longer a human being , ’ @entity34 reasoned			2
reporter @entity34 visited regional towns across @entity1 and was shocked by what she found one disturbing example of an ice addict who lost his human side , was a man @entity34 met who almost beat an undercover police officer to death			1
‘ he lost all empathy … while he was beating him he thought it was funny and ironic because the police officer was squealing and he thought it was a pig , ’ @entity34 said			2
in 2006 , the @entity20 's @entity171 program also showed the the psychosis some users suffer			1
they showed @entity175 , an ice - addicted mother who had become obsessed with rubbish , rummaging through bins and @entity179 who had just come out of jail			0
this time , in the small regional towns that ice has infiltrated @entity8 was confronted by a desperate lack of treatment facilities for those trying to get clean and under resourced or non-existent police			2
‘ the country needs and deserves better , ’ @entity34 said as she explained the solution to the epidemic is education about the drug and more treatment facilities			2
highlighting the difficulties people currently face when trying to get clean , @entity34 said : ‘ i met a woman named @entity197 in @entity26			1
for her to get into rehab , which is a sixth month program to reboot the brain to start producing dopamine again , she would lose her housing commission house and become homeless			0
’ in one community of less than 4,000 people @entity8 found up to one in ten people are using ice			2
a clinical nurse in regional @entity1 explained : ‘ the demographic for ice is changing all the time			0
we ’re noticing the age actually dropping , there ’s been reports of 10 year olds presenting at the @entity215 here			0
’ some of the young people @entity34 met told her that their friends had died before getting a spot in rehab			1
but the stigma around the drug has been diminished			0
‘ it ’s thought of as common as having a joint and you are the weird kid if you are not on it … we spoke to kids in the very small country towns of a few thousand people who said they could get three difference ounces up the hill on their bikes , ’ @entity34 said			2
on monday , the show @entity233 : @entity8 will illustrate how the drug is being made in homes in @entity1 @entity175 spoke about how she her teenage kids no longer lived with her			2
she went straight for about a year but suffered a relapse back into ice @entity179 was just out of jail when he appeared on tv to speak about his ice addiction in 2006			0
he said he sees people and the trees speak to him during his hallucinations unlike other drugs , ice does not have to be imported - it 's being cooked up in homes and even in the back of vans in @entity1			2
in august , @entity253 @entity252 spoke about a syndicate police had smashed and the ' very very big issue for @entity1 in 2014 '			0
' it 's tearing apart the fabric of our community , its destroying families , you 've only got to look at those before and after photographs to release this changes its not like humpty dumpty you ca n't put them back together again , they are forever damaged			0
' in @entity25 last month , where places like @entity271 are gripped with ice addiction , the state government announced more than 980 regional sporting clubs will be given financial help to tackle ice through education programs			0
‘ the expansion of the good spots program in regional and rural @entity25 will enable football and netball clubs to lead the discussion about the dangers of methamphetamine use , ’ minister for mental health @entity278 said			0
the @entity287 has been given $ 200,000 to run the program			0
watch the program @entity290 : four corners on monday 20 october , 8.30pm on @entity20			0
