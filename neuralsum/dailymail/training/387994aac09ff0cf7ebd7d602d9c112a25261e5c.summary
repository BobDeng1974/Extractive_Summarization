by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:41 est , 14 february 2013 updated : 02:51 est , 15 february 2013 @entity2 allegedly halted a review into high mortality rates at the trust and threatened to sack mr @entity6 a health chief who threatened to sack a whistleblower is now under investigation for quashing a probe into high death rates at his hospital			1
dame @entity2 , who is one of the most powerful women in the @entity14 , has been referred to the @entity15 for allegedly ditching an inspection at @entity14 trust three years ago			1
as many as 670 patients are feared to have died unnecessarily at the trust since 2009			2
concerned that the hospital ’s ‘ target culture ’ was putting patients at risk , @entity6 – who was then the trust ’s chief executive and has since turned whistleblower – told @entity2 in 2009 he was planning to get an external review of mortality rates			1
he was concerned that patients who were n’t seriously ill were being treated ahead of urgent cases , simply to allow the trust to meet targets			2
but @entity2 , 55 , who has been described as the ‘ right - hand woman ’ of @entity14 chief sir @entity31 , is said to have halted the review and warned mr @entity6 he ‘ would have to go ’			1
she has also been accused of writing a letter to the hospital trust ordering it to meet its waiting list targets ‘ whatever the demand ’			0
mr @entity6 said @entity2 told him in a face to face the trust must hit targets despite it being full to breaking point			1
this , he claims , endangered patients because meeting the non-emergency targets would require him to turn away emergency patients or cut down on care			2
in a handwritten note , @entity2 said to the chairman of the @entity51 @entity50 : ‘ need to meet targets whatever demand			2
’ the @entity53 understands that the @entity15 is now investigating a number of claims that @entity2 ’s actions put patients at risk			1
the @entity15 will now decide whether @entity2 – a former @entity59 who is a senior director on the @entity61 on a salary of £ 70,000 a year – should be hauled in front of a disciplinary hearing			1
this could lead to her being suspended or even struck off			0
whistleblower : @entity6 , former chief executive for @entity67 , has defied a legal gag to speak out against @entity14 management although she no longer practises as a gp , the humiliation would be disastrous for her career as one of the most senior @entity14 executives			0
the allegations , which date back to 2009 when @entity2 was head of the regional body in charge of @entity80 , were made by dr @entity81 and @entity82 , a journalist , who handed the @entity15 a dossier of evidence			1
@entity2 has been described as the ' right - hand woman ' of @entity14 boss sir @entity31 , pictured a spokesman for the @entity15 said it would not comment on cases under investigation			1
dame @entity2 lives in @entity90 , @entity91 , with her husband , dr @entity92 , 75 , a retired neurologist			0
she has two grown - up children			0
initially she was chief executive of @entity94 and was then appointed head of the @entity51 , which was in charge of @entity98 hospitals			0
in 2009 she was made a dame for her ‘ services to healthcare ’ and at the time said she was ‘ very honoured ’			0
she is now the national managing director of commissioning development at the @entity61 – the new body in charge of hospitals and gp services			0
a spokesman for the strategic health authority said : ‘ during her tenure as @entity110 chief executive , @entity2 acted at all times in the interest of patients , ensuring that they received high quality and safe services			2
’ mr @entity6 said he had told @entity2 that he was going to order a mortality rate review at the hospital due to the high number of patients he was having to treat			1
he said : ‘ i emailed @entity2 to set the agenda for the meeting the following day and i said i wanted to order a mortality review			2
‘ when i met her , she did n’t want to speak about it			0
she was incensed by my email			0
her words were : “ you will have to go or your career will be in tatters ”			0
’ he claimed : ‘ if she had acted on my concerns , i believe fewer people would have died			1
’ @entity6 was paid £ 500,000 to keep quiet after he was removed as chief executive of the @entity133			0

@entity6 claims @entity135 threatened him for *sparking* review
he claims she put targets before patients ' *welfare*
' if she had acted on my concerns , i believe fewer people would have died . '
@entity15 now investigating @entity2 over claims
