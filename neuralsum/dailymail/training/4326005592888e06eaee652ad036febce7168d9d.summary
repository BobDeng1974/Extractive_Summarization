an eco-friendly entrepreneur and former @entity2 student has gone two years without producing any trash after making a ' conscious decision to live sustainably ' during her final year of college			1
@entity6 , who majored in environmental science , began working towards living a ' @entity9 ' lifestyle while still studying at @entity2 and has been completely ' trash - free ' for the past two years			1
the @entity10 even makes her own toothpaste , deodorant and laundry detergent in an attempt to avoid creating any unnecessary waste - and recently founded her own eco-friendly company , @entity18 , through which she plans to sell her homemade products			1
' the first was my senior year of college when my professor @entity35 , of @entity37 fame , emphasized the importance living your values and made me think about my own personal environmental impact			1
' the second was when a fellow environmental studies major would bring lunch to class every week in a single use plastic bag , a disposable water bottle , and a plastic takeout container			1
' i would sit there and think , we are supposed to be the future of this planet and here we are with out trash , messing it up			2
' but while she was determined to embrace a waste - free lifestyle , the eco-blogger admits that the past two years have n't been without their difficulties - however after persevering for so long , she now feels that she is completely ' set up ' with everything she needs to keep pursuing a trash - free lifestyle			2
' as more and more time passes , i produce less and less , ' she explained to @entity62			2
' in the beginning , i was producing a lot more recycling			2
that ’s because i do n’t buy anything packaged in plastic anymore — i ’m sort of set up			0
' compost ? that has increased			0
since i was buying a lot of packaged food , there would n’t be things like kale spines in there			0
now , there are kale spines			0
i have more compost , more parts of whole vegetables			0
' eco-entrepreneur : the sustainability blogger recently founded her own waste - free cleaning supplies company , @entity18 the @entity2 graduate makes clear that living a trash - free existence is not always easy , and she urges any budding @entity9 followers to think carefully about the necessary planning that goes into her day - to - day life			1
' i stopped buying packaged products and began bringing my own bags and jars to fill with bulk products at the supermarket , ' she explained to @entity97			0
' i stopped buying new clothing , and shopped only secondhand			0
i continued making all of my own personal care and cleaning products			0
i downsized significantly by selling , donating , or giving away superfluous things in my life , such as all but one of my six identical spatulas , 10 pairs of jeans that i had n't worn since high school , and a trillion decorative items that had no significance to me at all			0
' most importantly , i started planning potentially wasteful situations ; i began saying " no " to things like straws in my cocktails at a bars , to plastic or paper bags at stores , and to receipts			0
' in order to encourage others to adopt the same trash - free philosophy , @entity6 began documenting the ups and downs of her lifestyle on her blog and became quickly inundated with queries from readers eager to follow in her eco-friendly footsteps , but worrying that they did n't have the time or skillset to product their own cleaning products like she does			1
making big bucks : @entity6 's @entity138 campaign has already raised more than $ 35,000 @entity139 , @entity6 's new waste - free cleaning supply company which she is funding through @entity138			1
' i was an environmental science major in college , and i not only wanted to learn about sustainability , i wanted to actually live it , ' @entity6 says in her @entity138 video			1
' i thought a lot about the questions " why the f * * k are there so many chemicals in everything ? " , " when did this become ok ? " and " are they even necessary ? " ' over the past two years , i 've been trying to answer these questions , and in the process making my own , well , everything , from toothpaste to deodorant to laundry detergent			0
' thus far , @entity6 's @entity138 campaign has received more than $ 35,000 in pledges from supporters - smashing her initial $ 10,000 target			1
her first product , a three - ingredient laundry detergent , is set to go on sale some time in the new year .			2

former @entity2 student @entity6 majored in environmental science but *insisted* she wanted to ' live ' sustainability , not just learn about it
the blogger has just founded her first environmentally - friendly company , @entity18
