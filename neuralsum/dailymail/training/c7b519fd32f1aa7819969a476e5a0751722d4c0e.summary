president @entity0 brushed off complaints levied by the @entity2 that his immigration actions are illegal in an @entity5 interview that aired today , saying that the @entity6 has ' limited resources ' and it only makes sense for the government to prioritize the removal of ' felons , criminals and recent arrivals ' over longtime residents and families			1
' everybody knows , including @entity2 , that we 're not going to deport 11 million people , ' @entity0 told @entity19 during a friday interview for his sunday morning program @entity22			1
' the reason that we have to do prosecutorial discretion in immigration is that we know that we are not even close to being able to deal with the folks who have been here a long time , ' he said			1
in the extended interview @entity0 and @entity19 also discussed the grand jury investigation into @entity31 police officer @entity30 and the 2016 presidential race			1
president @entity0 told @entity5 host @entity19 in an interview that aired today that his main piece of advice to residents of @entity31 would be to ' keep protests peaceful ' after the grand jury announces its decision in the case against police officer @entity30 when it comes to @entity31 , the president encouraged the @entity46 town 's residents to ' keep protests peaceful			1
' ' this is a country that allows everybody to express their views , but using any event as an excuse for violence is contrary to rule of law and contrary to who we are , ' @entity0 said			2
the president declined to say whether or not he was worried about outbursts of violence if @entity30 is not indicted on criminal charges for shooting and killing local teen @entity62 , however he noted that protests over the summer showed that there 's a ' possibility of even overwhelmingly peaceful crowds being overrun by a few thugs			1
' he also indicated that he may pay @entity31 a visit , depending on the outcome of the court case , which could be decided as soon as monday , and the town 's response to it			2
' in the end what i have confidence in is that if we do a better job of training our law enforcement to be sensitive to the concerns of minority communities , then over time trust can be built in part because minority communities typically are subject to more crime , ' he stated			0
' they need law enforcement more than anybody			0
' and there are a lot of communities in my hometown of @entity93 , for example , who actually want to see more police in , but they want to make sure that the police are trained so they can distinguish between a gangbanger and a kid who just happens to be wearing a hoodie but otherwise is a good kid and not doing anything wrong			2
' overall , @entity0 said he believed race relations were improving in @entity6 , however			1
' in a democracy progress is incremental and it goes in stutter steps and sometimes there 's some back - sliding , but the overall trajectory i think is positive , ' he concluded			0
prodded by @entity19 to endorse a successor , namely @entity113 frontrunner and former secretary of state @entity114 , @entity0 said he did n't want to ' jump the gun			1
' he did call @entity116 a ' friend , ' however , and attested that she did an ' outstanding ' job at @entity120			0
whoever the @entity113 nominee ends up being , @entity0 said it 's in his interest ' do everything i can obviously to make sure that whoever the nominee is is successful			2
' if @entity116 runs , she would be a ' formidable candidate , ' though , he said			0
' i think she 'd be a great president			1
' ' she 's not going to agree with me on everything , ' he acknowledged , and ' one of the benefits of running for president is you can stake out your own positions and have a clean slate , a fresh start			2
' pointing out that after six years he has ' some dings , ' @entity0 told @entity19 , ' i think the @entity6 people , you know , they 're going to want that new car smell			1
' they want to drive something off the lot that does n't have as much mileage as me			1
' speaking about immigration , @entity0 said it only makes sense for the government to prioritize the removal of ' felons , criminals and recent arrivals ' over children and families who have been in the @entity6 for a long time speaking about immigration , @entity0 again called on the @entity160 to pass a comprehensive immigration bill that would provide a pathway to citizenship for millions of immigrants residing in @entity6 illegally			1
' ultimately @entity165 has a responsibility to deal with these issues , and there are some things that i ca n't do on my own , ' @entity0 said			1
to republicans complaining that he should n't have acted unilaterally , including @entity160 speaker @entity172 , @entity0 said his response is this : ' go ahead and pass legislation			1
' ' in the meantime , what we 've got to make sure of is , number one , that our borders are secure and , number two , it 's gon na to allow us to focus on the people that we really want out , number three , what it allows us to do is to say to folks who have been here for awhile , register ... you 're going to submit to a criminal background check , and you 're going to pay taxes			0
' he also chided republicans for threatening to stop working with him on a host of other issues over his immigration mandate			0
' what the @entity6 people expect is that if we disagree on one thing , then we disagree on that thing and then we work on everything else , ' he argued			2
@entity160 @entity2 need to stop holding other legislative fixes ' hostage ' over ' one disagreement , ' he said , referencing the government shutdown last year over @entity210 funding			0
@entity0 formally announced his plans to delay deportations for as many as 5 million illegal immigrants during a presidential address on thursday evening from the @entity215			0
the next day he traveled to @entity216 in @entity217 , @entity218 , to celebrate with his supporters			0
on the way there , he issued two memorandums to the @entity223 affiliated with his immigration orders			0
but the president 's actions were met with less enthusiasm than he likely expected from some advocates of comprehensive immigration reform who think his executive actions did n't go far enough			0
while they protect individuals who were were brought to the @entity6 as children from deportation as well as the parents of @entity6 - born children , his directive will not keep the parents of illegal immigrant children from being sent back to their home countries			0
president @entity0 waves to the crowd as he leaves the auditorium at @entity216 , in @entity217 , @entity218 , on friday after his speech on immigration			2
roughly 1,600 activists gathered there to thank @entity0 for deferring deportations for 5 million illegal immigrants during friday 's speech two young men from @entity250 called out the president for not expanding his deferred deportation program to cover the parents of so - called @entity255 , as well			2
' why did you leave my mom behind ? ' @entity256 says they shouted at him			0
in his response the president assured him that ' this is a just a first step , ' and ' it ’s not the only step			0
' ' we ’re still going to have to do more work , ' he said , explaining that @entity165 still needs to pass a bill making ' permanent ' his changes to the immigration process so that they are not undone by the next president			0
@entity272 sen. @entity271 said sunday that @entity0 practically did give every illegal immigrant residing in @entity6 amnesty because the memo he sent @entity223 ' says they are not to enforce immigration laws other than for violent criminals ' and a few other discrete categories			1
' the president is instructing the executive branch [ to ] no longer enforce the immigration laws , ' @entity271 , a probable @entity2 candidate for president in 2016 , told @entity285 host @entity284			1
' it is a stunning and sad display of a president declining to honor his constitutional obligation to take care that the laws be faithfully executed			1
' @entity271 said what @entity0 did last week is ' a wholesale refusal to follow our immigration laws , ' and he 's ' essentially he 's gotten in the job of counterfeiting immigration papers , because there 's no legal authority to do what he 's doing			2
' leading @entity301 @entity114 , on the other hand , came out in favor of former boss ' actions over the weekend during an appearance at the @entity306			0
' i think the president took an historic step and i support it , ' she said , according to the @entity311 .			0
