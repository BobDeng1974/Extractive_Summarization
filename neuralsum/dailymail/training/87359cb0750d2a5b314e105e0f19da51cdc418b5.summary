a young woman ripped from the jaws of a deadly crocodile has spoken of her miraculous recovery following the horrific ordeal			1
pretty @entity5 was grabbed by the monster croc while paddling with friends in a freshwater pool near @entity9 , in the north of @entity11			1
the 23 - year - old had been working aboard luxury cruiser , @entity14 , on @entity15 this year , when she decided to cool off in the water			0
survivor : @entity5 was ripped from the jaws of a deadly crocodile that attacked her while she was paddling with friends in a freshwater pool in @entity11 wounds : the cuts were so deep the pool ran red and @entity5 feared she would lose her leg ( left )			1
she was airlifted to hospital in the cruise ship 's helicopter ( right ) what should have been a relaxing dip soon turned into a nightmare for the hostess when she felt the crocodile grab her left leg with excruciating force			1
@entity5 , from @entity34 in @entity11 , said she realised immediately what had happened			1
she said : ' i felt this impact on my leg and i was pulled under water			2
straight away i knew it was a crocodile			2
' i managed to get my head up and scream ' croc ' and then this giant dragged me under again			2
he was playing with me like i was a teddy bear			0
' i got my head above water again and this time i was swearing and saying get this thing off me			0
i was just screaming for help			0
' i could n't feel any pain but i could see his teeth sinking into my leg			0
' i thought i was going to die			0
i could only see about four centimetres of the top of my leg and the rest was in the croc 's gob			1
' beast : saltwater crocodiles usually wait for their prey to get close to the water 's edge before striking and use their incredible strength to drag them into the water brave : @entity5 with ' @entity67 ' , her friend and the man who tackled a vicious crocodile with his bare hands to save her life @entity5 's friend and colleague , @entity75 , was watching on from the shore and thought @entity5 was playing an april fools prank			1
however , the 35 - year - old , who had checked the 3x5m pool for danger beforehand , soon realised it was no joke when @entity5 continued to scream and the water filled with blood			1
@entity67 , who is known as @entity67 , stepped in to help @entity5 and with the help of bystander , @entity84 , wrestled the giant three - metre crocodile			1
@entity67 prised open its colossal jaws until @entity5 was eventually freed			1
rescue : @entity5 tied a t - shirt around her wound and was airlifted to hospital on the luxury vessel 's helicopter he said : ' it was april fools day and for a moment i thought @entity5 was winding us up			1
' however soon i saw the crocodile on top of her			0
i jumped into the water and on to its back and stuck my thumbs into its eyes until i felt it start to slacken off			1
' @entity5 was bleeding pretty heavily			2
i picked up the croc and chucked it back into the water and it came back at me			0
' i would n't ever want to do it again			0
i 'm just glad i took the chance to try and save her			0
' brave : @entity5 suffers panic attacks from her ordeal but recently came face - to - face with a croc to confront her fears and made her peace with the reptiles @entity5 added : ' it was a massive crocodile and @entity123 had his fingers in its mouth , trying to open it			1
' but crocodiles have lockjaw and even if you 're the strongest man in the world you could not pull a crocodile 's mouth apart			2
' my leg was in the air and i was punching the croc on the nose but i was powerless to do anything			2
' i looked at @entity123 and realised my life was in his hands and there was nothing i could do but stay strong			0
' after realising the true horror of what was happening , videographer @entity84 jumped into the pool and held @entity5 's head above water just as the crocodile prepared for a death roll			1
@entity5 said : ' @entity67 stuck his thumbs back deeper into its eyes and it released its grip a little bit and i managed to get my leg out with the help of @entity84			1
' i looked at my leg and it had been ripped to pieces			0
i thought i had a chance of losing my leg at that stage			2
' @entity5 bravely wrapped a t - shirt and some towels around her mangled leg to try and suppress the bleeding			1
@entity123 and @entity84 then put @entity5 in a dinghy and they sped back to @entity14 where the crew were waiting anxiously			2
@entity5 was airlifted to a hospital where surgeons spent the next four hours desperately trying to piece her leg back together			1
both @entity67 and @entity170 have since won awards for their selfless acts from the @entity174 's @entity173			0
meanwhile , despite still suffering panic attacks , @entity5 has made a miraculous recovery after undergoing seven months of intense physiotherapy and treatment for @entity179			1
@entity5 even recently visited crew on @entity14 and confronted her fears at a wildlife park where she came face - to - face with a crocodile			1
she said : ' seeing that croc i thought it was actually a beautiful creature			2
i wanted to pat him			0
' i owe @entity67 my life			0
i do n't know how to thank him enough			0
' i still think i must have had someone looking over me that day , my pop or my nanna or someone close to me who was looking after me			0
' but maybe that 's just the way life is and i was just the luckiest girl in the world			0
' @entity197 is a popular beauty spot in @entity11 @entity14 , the luxury cruise boat @entity5 was working on in @entity9 in @entity11 scenery : @entity197 is a magnificent natural harbour popular with holidaymakers mr @entity203 , from @entity11 's @entity204 , said miss @entity5 was taking a swim in a fresh water pool in an area known for crocodiles			1
' it was not far from the salt water area and as she was exiting the water she was grabbed by a crocodile , ' said mr @entity203			0
' she received lacerations and puncture wounds from the attack			0
' he said the crocodile was still in the area and he urged others not to swim there			0
' that area 's very well known for crocodiles , so i think removing people from the environment instead of removing the crocodile from the environment sounds like a good idea			2

@entity5 was savaged by a crocodile in @entity11
her friend freed her by *gouging* the croc 's eyes with his thumbs
the cruise ship worker thought she would lose her leg but has since made a miraculous recovery
