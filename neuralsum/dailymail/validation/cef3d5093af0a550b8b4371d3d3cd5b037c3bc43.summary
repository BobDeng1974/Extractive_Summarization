for those desperately in need of a weekend by the sea , look no further than @entity4 's southeast coast , only an hour drive from bustling @entity6			1
while the charming town of @entity10 offers plenty of quaint @entity12 to choose from , the refurbished sheriff @entity7 , in @entity8 , provides the perfect base for larger groups or families to explore the area			1
but , be warned : you will be required to disconnect fully , as @entity18 is not always readily available , and 3g access is spotty to say the least			0
sheriff @entity7 , located near @entity10 in @entity8 , @entity4 , is a refurbished grain storehouse as it turns out , the three - day break from our mobiles was a blessing - though no easy feat for seven twenty - somethings from @entity28 - as it forced us to get outside and actually speak to each other while spending time in the home 's circular sitting room			1
finding the house - without cell phone service , i might add - was the first hurdle to cross on our way to a relaxing weekend by the shore			0
arriving in @entity6 on the last thursday evening flight out of @entity39 , by the time we had secured our car rental , we were well into the midnight hour			1
our first several attempts to find the house , without the help of gps or street lights , was simply put , a comedy of errors			0
thankfully , the owners are used to dealing with such overwhelming confusion and after several hours - and several phone calls - we pulled up to the sprawling granary , which had been turned into a holiday home several years ago by the owner 's father - in - law			1
@entity55 is located just a 10 minute drive from the quaint seaside town of @entity10 @entity58 ( pictured ) posing at the @entity10 marina , where plenty of sailboats are available to rent despite the late night , we woke up early to set out in search of the closest town , @entity10 , with its quaint shops , artisanal bakeries , and most important for our weary - traveller purposes , a @entity68			1
our hunt for food was quickly abandoned , however , when we saw the stunning @entity72 beach , which in the low tide , seemingly went on forever			0
the small marina was every bit as picturesque , offering views of the @entity78 and plenty of brightly - coloured sailboats and canoes tied up and waiting to be taken out			2
for those travelling with small children , it 's also worth noting that the harbour is home to the @entity86 , where tours can be organised to learn more about the area 's local marine life , most notably gannets and puffins			1
in the low tide , the stunning @entity72 beach seemingly goes on forever , overlooking the @entity78 the small town is full of quirky souvenir shops , artisanal bakeries and charming local eateries on the sprawling @entity55 property , there are many friendly horses ( and chickens ) roaming free back at the granary , the holiday home is situated on a working farm , which means , animal lovers may even be able to take part in the horses ' morning feedings , so long as you ask nicely			1
chickens roam the property freely , alongside the horses and , at times , the owner 's two friendly labradors			0
near the main entrance of the granary is a cow barn , which , especially for the young urban males in our group , provided many hours of entertainment			0
what can i say ? they work in the @entity121			0
the @entity122 towers 187 m ( 614 ft ) above the town , but offers a relatively easy climb along its paths at the summit of the law is the famous ' whale 's jawbone , ' although its now a fibreglass replica @entity127 offers beautiful panoramic views of the township , coastline and the @entity78 in the distance follow the gravel driveway from the house 's front door and you 'll stumble across the entrance to @entity140 , a 215 km ( 134 mile ) walking path that stretches across the country , from @entity143 in the west through to @entity145 on the east coast			2
from @entity55 , you can walk towards the town of @entity10 and the @entity149 , which turns out to be about a two - hour trek , or , alternatively toward @entity151 and on to the end of the trail at @entity145			1
although we initially set out for @entity145 , we unexpectedly wound up walking back toward @entity10 and its staggering 187 m ( 614 ft ) hill , known as the law			1
the summit features the remnants of an @entity160 fort and the town 's infamous whale jawbone , which has stood there atop the peak since 1709			2
currently , a fibreglass replica of the original can be seen upon scaling the hill , after being anonymously donated in 2008			0
inside the home , which has been remodelled to the highest quality , there is a working fireplace and piano the sleeping quarters are located in two separate wings - perfect for families vacationing together and inside the house , the rustic furnishings are just as beautiful as the stately grounds			1
the main living and dining area is circular , with several floor - to - ceiling windows illuminating the entire space			0
a working fireplace and grand piano offer two additional luxurious touches			2
there are two bedroom wings located on either side of the house and accessible via separate staircases			0
a second sitting area can be used upstairs , next to the master bedroom and master bathroom the main staircase leads to a second living space , complete with master bedroom , bathroom and children 's play area - perfect if two families are travelling together			1
on the other side , the upstairs boasts a double bedroom , one room with two twin beds and an additional bathroom			0
downstairs , off the kitchen , you 'll find the house 's fourth bedroom , complete with bunk beds , and during the warmer months , younger visitors will undoubtedly be equally as thrilled to find an enclosed pool off to the side of the back garden			0
and with @entity217 , and the may bank holidays , just weeks away , there 's no better time to visit			0
@entity220 is urging families to explore @entity223 's great outdoors this spring and summer , as part of its @entity226 campaign , even offering families the chance to win £ 500 off their next country break , like this one			2
@entity232 travelled from @entity39 to @entity6 on @entity233 , where fares start at £ 66 roundtrip			1
@entity220 arranged three nights accommodation for seven people at @entity238 in @entity8 , @entity4			2
in april , a three - night stay starts at £ 1395 .			0
