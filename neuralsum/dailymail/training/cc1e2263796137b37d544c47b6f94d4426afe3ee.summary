following the @entity52 invasion of @entity1 — @entity95 , which began in june 1941 — the @entity96 swept eastwards , destroying whole @entity45 armies and capturing two million prisoners , most of whom they starved to death			2
scenting final victory , @entity100 ordered a dash for @entity9 , while another @entity52 army group swung southwards to grab the oilfields			2
