by @entity0 follow @ @ charlieskillen @entity3 ’s pre-season has been the perfect one in the sense that some matches and displays have given reason for confidence , others exposed glaring holes in the set - up			2
impressive wins over the likes of @entity14 and @entity15 have been compounded by limp efforts as seen against @entity17			0
on tuesday night , @entity20 visit @entity18 in the final friendly before @entity3 's trip to @entity23 next monday			1
equally , @entity52 's injury and the continued misfiring of @entity25 give a worrying vision of @entity3 's attack were @entity43 not available			1
it does n't seem like there will be a surfeit of first team exits from @entity18 , but there are still a couple of starting roles up for grabs			0
here , @entity64 looks at the players - old and young - who still have something to prove before the big kick - off			0
danger man : new boy @entity43 scored twice during the @entity42 ' tour of @entity71 all smiles : @entity73 ( left ) shared this image of himself sharing a shower with @entity76 ( right ) on @entity77 @entity26 the @entity80 midfielder ’s usual boundless energy was not enough to make up for his wayward passing and ill - discipline on the field last season , and with the arrival of @entity29 it looks as if @entity26 will find first - team chances far harder to come by this season			1
straight on the back of @entity80 's @entity91 nightmare comes a question over the starting berths of @entity3 charges @entity26 , @entity76 and @entity95			1
however , @entity34 is still a stickler for physicality and work - rate and @entity26 is fresh from netting a scorcher in sunday ’s friendly against @entity15			2
he is also one of the few players remaining from the club ’s victorious @entity102 campaign in 2012 – with the @entity105 manager on the lookout for experience in a dressing room shorn of @entity109 and @entity110			0
impress at @entity18 and @entity34 could well be looking for that experience for a potentially tricky opening monday night at @entity23			0
man in the middle : @entity116 @entity26 could provide physicality in the heart of @entity34 's midfield @entity25 @entity25 has had more last chances than anyone else in the last few years at @entity18 , but he remains one of just three senior strikers at the club – and returning 36 - year - old @entity52 is now facing an injury lay - off			1
last season fell at the final hurdle thanks to a lack of striking options , and having just @entity25 and @entity43 available has n’t done much to alleviate fears of the same problem rearing it 's head			2
the @entity133 has added to his collection of close - range misses in this pre-season campaign , and will have to cap a good display against @entity20 with a goal if @entity34 is n’t to be tempted into a last dip into the transfer market			2
drought : @entity25 must start finding the back of the net more regularly next season @entity145 having been such a world class performer in goal for @entity3 for almost a decade should mean @entity145 has no place on a list like this , but @entity153 ’ arrival from a long - term loan at @entity155 changes the no 1 situation considerably			1
the @entity158 stopper did little to impress in conceding @entity159 ’ late goal in last week ’s friendly , and a goalkeeper of such talent should n’t be forced to stay on the bench as his career enters its final third			0
a typically commanding display in this match would make @entity34 ’s most difficult decision even more unpalatable			0
still no 1 ? @entity145 faces serious competition from young goalkeeper @entity153 next season @entity170 @entity171 , a stalwart of the @entity3 defence , whose quality and experience can not be easily dismissed			1
however , with @entity177 ’ arrival at left back , the @entity175 may face a fight for the right - back berth with @entity180			0
there is no doubt there is a need for all of these players in the squad – particularly with @entity170 ’s ability to play in a centre half positon where @entity3 look light – but one will miss out on the majority of starting xis			2
@entity170 ’s impressive pre-season so far should continue against @entity20 , and if he can cap off his usual defensive efforts with a goal from a set - piece he ’ll have all the more reason to be confident heading into the new season			2
versatile : @entity170 faces a fight to earn himself a starting spot at right back or in central defence @entity200 the 20 - year - old striker seems destined for another loan move after spells at @entity204 and @entity205 , but @entity52 's injury may have made @entity34 re-think			1
make no bones about it , if @entity3 are to challenge on all fronts they need another striker			0
although raw and not the complete forward , @entity200 is clinical in the box to a degree which the current iteration of @entity25 can only dream of			0
if he plays on tuesday night and grabs a goal or two , @entity34 will find it hard to rule him out of the reckoning			1
the only issue would be whether he would be better served by regular football on loan			0
big opportunity : @entity200 ( left ) could become @entity34 's fourth - choice striker this season			1

@entity34 's men host @entity226 side @entity20 on tuesday night
the @entity42 have had mixed results during their pre-season tour of @entity71
new signings @entity29 and @entity43 have impressed
@entity26 is *battling* for a place in @entity34 's midfield after the arriving of @entity29 from @entity235
@entity25 has fallen down the pecking order this summer
@entity145 faces serious competition in the shape of @entity153
@entity170 could struggle to break into the first xi
@entity200 has a chance to become @entity3 's fourth striker
