by @entity0 home secretary @entity1 has emerged as the bookies favourite to succeed @entity3 after taking on the police @entity1 has been installed as the favourite to succeed @entity3 as her extraordinary confrontation with police leaders was hailed as one of the bravest political speeches of recent decades			1
conservative mps expressed admiration for the home secretary ’s declaration at the @entity15 conference that a string of scandals has left the legitimacy of @entity20 policing under threat			1
@entity20 ’s former ambassador to the @entity23 , sir @entity22 , told the @entity26 @entity25 programme that mrs may had ‘ echoes of @entity33 ’ and had delivered ‘ one of the most powerful , courageous and candid speeches by a cabinet minister i have ever seen ’			1
one senior @entity35 woman said : ‘ @entity1 was already a contender to succeed @entity3 but some of my more boorish male colleagues have n’t taken the idea entirely seriously			1
’ @entity40 promptly slashed the odds on mrs may succeeding mr @entity3 as the next leader of the @entity35 party , making her 4/1 favourite ahead of the mayor of @entity46 , @entity47 , the 5/1 second favourite and @entity49 at 8/1			1
' mrs may 's speech to the @entity15 seems to have done her leadership prospects no harm at all , ’ said the bookmaker ’s @entity53			1
making her annual appearance at the federation ’s conference in @entity59 , the home secretary left officers at the conference in stunned silence as she used the speech to upbraid them for often displaying ‘ contempt for the public ’ , and reel off allegations of corruption cases including the @entity69 and @entity70 murders			1
she said the federation , which represents 126,000 rank and file officers , and had faced accusations of bullying and a lack of transparency in its accounts , now had to change from ‘ from top to bottom ’			0
officers would no longer automatically become members of the federation , instead having to opt in , the home secretary added			0
he announcement that she was cutting off public funds for the federation was seen as the most aggressive act by central government towards police rank and file since the defeat of the police strike in 1918 , nearly a century ago			2
public money previously spent on the federation will instead go towards a new scheme called @entity97 , aimed at attracting university graduates into the force			2
former @entity101 activist @entity100 claimed mrs may had given ‘ one of the most incredible speeches delivered by a @entity20 politician in peacetime ’			2
he said he struggled to think of a time when a politician had ‘ laid it on the line like that ’ , comparing it to @entity113 ’s infamous confrontation of @entity101 ’s militant wing in 1985			0
‘ she began in conciliatory tone , remembering fallen officers , and delivering a tribute to the understated bravery of their colleagues and then , without missing a beat , she tore the police service apart , ’ he said			2
‘ slowly and methodically the home secretary read out the charge sheet			0
finally a senior politician has told the @entity15 what it needed to hear			0
' whatever issues @entity3 ’s party have with the police , they are still the putative party of law and order			1
' it was the equivalent of [ ex-labour minister ] @entity138 turning up to the @entity139 when he was health secretary and telling their delegates , " forget all that stuff about you all being angels			2
patients have been dying of thirst on your watch , and it has to stop "			0
’ mrs may used a devastating speech to the @entity15 to exert her authority over officers @entity35 leadership rival @entity47 yesterday spent the day on the campaign trail with mr @entity3 in @entity149 @entity150 , former adviser to @entity101 home secretary @entity151 said : ‘ it is the sort of speech i wish in retrospect my former boss had been able to make			1
’ @entity156 , who is hoping to become the @entity15 ’s chairman , said he was at a loss to understand the tone of the home secretary 's address			0
he said delegates had arrived at the auditorium prepared to agree to reform but were left in ‘ anger and bewilderment ’			0
but sir @entity167 , chief constable of @entity169 police and vice-president of the @entity171 , told @entity173 ’s today programme : ‘ i have to agree with a lot of what the home secretary said			2
a lot of the various scandals have damaged the image of policing			0
the federation needs to get on with the change agreed yesterday			0
’ the steely home secretary , hailed as ' @entity20 's @entity184 ' by her allies , would not countenance any sort of leadership challenge to @entity3 , and has repeatedly stressed her loyalty to him			1
however , she is understood to regard @entity47 as ' faintly ridiculous ' and is determined to prevent him becoming leader in the event of the @entity191 losing the next election .			0

@entity35 minister used extraordinary speech to attack police over scandals
she warned public faith in the @entity20 police is now under threat
allies say even ' boorish male ' mps are *waking* up to her leadership *potential*
bookies install her as favourite to *replace* @entity3 as @entity35 leader
