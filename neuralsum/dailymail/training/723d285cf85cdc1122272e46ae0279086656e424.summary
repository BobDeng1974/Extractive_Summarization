by @entity0 published : 05:21 est , 26 june 2012 updated : 11:11 est , 26 june 2012 @entity3 's spin doctor helped his celebrity wife run an ' avoidance ' scheme that may have diverted thousands away from the tax man , it was claimed today			2
@entity10 's partner , @entity12 news presenter @entity9 , could have pocketed an extra £ 22,000 a year by being paid through a private company the pair set up , according to newspaper reports			1
it comes just days after the prime minister declared comedian @entity18 ' morally wrong ' for putting millions in an offshore tax dodging scheme			0
but it appears one of his closest aides helped his wife to run a company for several years that may have reduced the tax she paid on her estimated £ 150,000 - a - year earnings			1
claims : the @entity29 has said a business set up to handle @entity12 presenter @entity9 's pay was an ' avoidance ' scheme ' it is total hypocrisy and @entity10 should stay out of @entity39 until it is sorted out , ' @entity36 mp @entity35 told the @entity29 last night			1
' the @entity18 publicity stunt has clearly come back to haunt the prime minister			0
' mr @entity10 , who is a former senior @entity12 executive , ran @entity43 with ms @entity9 to handle her earnings			1
he was paid £ 2,999.97 to be secretary			2
star : top presenter @entity9 , pictured on @entity47 in a controversial short skirt , may have saved thousands by being paid through a company the tv presenter hit the headlines herself recently after wearing a short skirt to work on the @entity47 sofa			1
classed as a ' tv and journalism ' company , they were helped by accountant @entity58 , who says he helps tv producers ' make sure their tax bills are kept as low as possible '			2
figures from @entity62 seen by @entity63 show that around £ 150,000 a year was funnelled into @entity64			1
if ms @entity9 had earned the cash via @entity67 she would have paid around £ 52,000 a year in income tax and national insurance , according to the @entity29			1
but paying herself via a company would have allowed her to cut this to as little as £ 29,800 , making a tax saving of up to £ 22,000 a year , the paper claims			1
these are based on figures to 2008 , when the company changed the type of return it sent to @entity62			1
last year mr @entity10 quit as @entity82 's secretary after details of the company emerged , not long after mr @entity3 's previous spin doctor and former @entity87 editor @entity85 resigned over the hacking scandal			1
mr @entity10 was also in the news last month after he was filmed giving @entity12 political correspondent @entity90 a dressing down over his coverage of the @entity93			2
a source close to mr @entity10 told @entity63 today : ‘ there was never any tax saving motive			1
it was a condition of employment by the @entity12			2
couple : no.10 spin doctor @entity10 , left , was secretary of his wife @entity9 's company , and it s has been claimed today this business would have allowed her to avoid up to £ 22,000 a year in tax ‘ @entity9 does not have a staff job and as a freelance presenter you are told to make this arrangement			1
freelance presenters do not got maternity pay or pension benefits or sick pay			0
‘ claims about the benefits have been wildly exaggerated			2
’ the @entity12 was last month under intense pressure to reveal how many of its stars are channelling their pay through private companies			0
mps accused the corporation of paying senior figures ‘ off - payroll ’ – meaning they can potentially cut their tax bills by thousands of pounds a year			2
replacement : mr @entity10 came into @entity39 after @entity85 , pictured with @entity3 , quit because of the hacking scandal row : @entity127 was inadvertently caught on camera berating a @entity12 correspondent , @entity90 , outside no. 10 @entity39 last month @entity130 , chief secretary to the treasury , revealed that more than 2,400 civil servants have been paid through a private company			1
this means they can pay the corporation tax rate of 21 per cent , rather than higher rates of income tax			0
but , to the fury of mps , he said he was unable to provide similar information about public servants who work for local councils and the @entity12 , because they are not controlled by central government			0
probe : chief secretary to the treasury @entity130 is investigating how many civil servants are avoiding tax but can not look into the @entity12 's affairs the corporation has said it pays ‘ up to 3,000 ’ actors , editors , make - up artists and other ‘ craft staff ’ through service companies			1
of these , 36 earn more than £ 100,000			0
but it refused to reveal how many top presenters and other talent are paid this way			0
in the past it has been reported that household names including @entity163 presenters @entity164 , @entity165 and @entity166 as well as @entity169 stars @entity167 and @entity170 have set up companies to channel their earnings , because they are on freelance contracts			0
this allows some high profile presenters to off - set expenses against tax , therefore dramatically boosting their net income			0
the corporation flatly refuses to give concrete numbers of those paid in this way , saying it was ‘ commercially sensitive ’ and would breach data protection laws			0
mr @entity130 told @entity140 : ‘ the review could not include either local government or the @entity12 , who are not under the direct control of central government			0
' mr @entity10 is away in @entity189 with the pm and declined to comment but a source close to him said his wife had not made huge savings from the company			1
a @entity12 spokesman said : ' there is no fixed rule that requires presenters to be self - employed			0
it wil depend on her role			0
but if they are then the @entity12 requires them to do this through a service company			2
this is in order to ensure they are responsible for their tax affairs			0
it is not done to avoid tax			0

@entity10 was secretary of @entity43 , a business set up to deal with his @entity12 presenter partner @entity9 's earnings
@entity62 figures seen by @entity63 show around £ 150,000 a year was paid into the firm
the @entity29 claims the business could have saved her £ 22,000 a year in tax
' *speculation* around her *financial* benefits from setting up a company is wildly *inaccurate* , ' a source close to the couple said
