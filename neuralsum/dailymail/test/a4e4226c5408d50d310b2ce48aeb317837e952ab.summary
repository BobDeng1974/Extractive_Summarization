for more than 2,000 years , invaders have been fighting over glorious @entity1			1
@entity2 , the @entity8 , the @entity9 , the @entity10 , the @entity6 , @entity7 and , during the @entity5 , the @entity3 and @entity4 have all left their mark			0
fortunately , the present settlers - the @entity12 themselves and the odd expat - have stoutly resisted the encroachment of mass tourism			2
so instead of fast - food restaurants you will find charming family - run tavernas that make this island a foodie heaven			1
great forests of pines , cypress and cedars still sweep down the steep hillsides , often ending in cliffs of chalk as white as those at @entity31 , or in fine shingle and sand beaches , fringing a sea whose warm , sun - reflecting waters are of startling clarity			2
the famous curve of @entity41 , as well as many little inland villages , are seen on the road to @entity44 @entity50 , the roads , winding around mountains whose accessible slopes are swathed in olive groves and vineyards are blessedly free of excessive traffic			1
we landed at the island 's only airport near the capital town of @entity57 , took a five - minute walk to the car - rental office and were quickly on our way to the village of @entity62 on the southern coast - our first base of a two - centre holiday			1
@entity66 rejoices in unspoiled @entity1 we were staying first at the superb @entity67			1
the view from our shady veranda was wonderful - indeed , my @entity71 wife called it ' awesome '			2
the sweep of @entity75 , with its long sandy beaches , was spread out below us , while the neighbouring island of @entity78 could be seen in the misty distance			1
@entity80 is a modern villa with a well - equipped kitchen , and we love to cook			2
however , after a long day travelling , we decided we needed restorative cocktails , a carafe of white wine and a good fish dinner			2
not fancying driving along twisting lanes , we called a taxi to take us to the beautifully situated and highly regarded @entity91 restaurant at @entity93 beach			0
the proprietor is a local fisherman , so the best of his catch goes to the kitchen , which is presided over by his wife , while his charming daughter @entity99 is in charge of front of house			1
from @entity75 you can see @entity104 , where the beautiful @entity105 ( pictured ) is found a sweeping view across the turquoise waters of @entity108 and the white stands of @entity110 the island is replete with diverse things to see on day trips but the nightlife is virtually non-existent , so we decided to stay home in the evenings and explore during the day			1
we checked out the string of beaches around @entity75 and found plenty of good restaurants			1
at the top of a flight of easy steps from @entity75 beach , we found @entity127 's @entity126 restaurant , with superb food lovingly prepared by the eponymous owner with ingredients from her husband 's organic farm			1
the portions are generous and there 's a great view across the bay to fellow @entity138 isle @entity78			1
the popular @entity140 beach is just at the end of the bay			0
the @entity142 is a good place for coffee and the area is lined with tavernas			0
we shopped for supplies for our evening meals at @entity57 's port			2
one can buy catch - of - the - night fish straight from the boats that line the quay ( park where you like , for free )			2
the popular golden @entity140 beach is just at the end of the bay with the nearby @entity142 good for coffee the town of @entity57 's port is ideal for picking up supplies , including catch - of - the - night fish from the boats enjoyable excursions to the countryside took us to the ruined hilltop castle of @entity166 , near @entity167 , and the monastery of @entity169			1
at both places entrance is free , and do n't miss the @entity173 cafe just outside the gates			0
its enthusiastic proprietors are @entity12 / @entity177 and serve superior food in a shady garden			0
@entity180 of @entity181 is situated in a vine - clad valley north - east of the castle			1
it was rebuilt in @entity185 - style in the 1960s , the original having been destroyed during a 1953 earthquake			2
the walls of the interior are decorated in exuberant style with biblical scenes , and a huge candelabra hangs from the ceiling			0
we loved our stay in the south , but for the second week of our stay it was time to take the 35 - mile drive to @entity44 , on the island 's north cape			1
the trip afforded superb views of the coast - including the famous curve of @entity41 - as well as many little inland villages			0
@entity44 , once a remote fishing port , has been transformed into a world - class yachting centre , with smart restaurants and boutiques jostling for every inch of the quayside			1
the second week of our stay was a 35 - mile drive away in the fishing village of @entity44 , in the island 's north ' it 's like @entity219 in the old days , ' i mused			1
our villa , @entity221 , is set on the hillside overlooking the port			0
from its verandas and infinity pool the neighbouring islands of @entity226 - mythical home of @entity227 - and @entity228 could be seen through the shimmering sea mist			0
we found some attractive beaches a few minutes ' drive from @entity44			1
our two favourites were @entity236 and @entity237 , both reached by turning right out of the village of @entity239 and following the signs			0
@entity236 is considered a ' secret ' place , peaceful even in august			0
when we visited ( in september ) , fewer than a dozen people were enjoying the sunbeds provided			0
@entity244 is considered a ' secret ' place , peaceful even in august , and a favourite of the writer there 's an excellent taverna , with fresh fish and dishes from a menu that changes daily			0
@entity237 , on the other hand , is a tiny cove with a miniature beach			0
it 's lovely to swim there			0
among the fir trees above the beach is a modern restaurant where fresh prawns can be had			0
apart from one afternoon of rain ( we were on a boat trip to @entity228 but 30 minutes out of @entity44 , an unexpected squall hit us and it rained for the remainder of the trip ) , the weather was perfect			1
we had a wonderful time with beautiful scenery , great food and fun when we wanted it			0
i can see why so many people have wanted to invade @entity1 !			2

visited @entity62 in the south of @entity1 and then @entity44 , in the north
first , from @entity278 , could see @entity75 and @entity78 island
charming local , family - run eateries were found throughout the island
nightlife is virtually non-existent , so spent energy exploring during the day
@entity44 , once a remote fishing port , is now a world - class yachting centre
