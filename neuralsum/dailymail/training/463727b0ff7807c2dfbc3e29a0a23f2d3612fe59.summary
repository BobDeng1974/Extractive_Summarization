by @entity0 , executive chairman of google @entity3 executive chairman @entity0 said the search giant has developed breakthrough technology that will allow illegal videos to be ' tagged ' last week 348 people were arrested in @entity8 – and 386 young kids rescued – in one of the largest child sex investigations ever seen			1
it defies belief that anyone would sexually abuse children , especially teachers and doctors entrusted with their care			2
but this awful case highlights the depths to which humanity can sink			0
and while society will never wholly eliminate such depravity , we should do everything in our power to protect children from harm			1
that 's why internet companies like @entity3 and @entity31 have been working with law enforcement for years to stop paedophiles sharing illegal pictures on the web			2
we actively remove child sexual abuse imagery from our services and immediately report abuse to the authorities			1
this evidence is regularly used to prosecute and convict criminals			0
but as @entity43 said in a speech this summer , there 's always more that can be done			0
we 've listened , and in the last three months put more than 200 people to work developing new , state - of - the - art technology to tackle the problem			1
cleaning up search : we 've fine tuned @entity50 to prevent links to child sexual abuse material from appearing in our results			1
while no algorithm is perfect – and @entity3 can not prevent paedophiles adding new images to the web – these changes have cleaned up the results for over 100,000 queries that might be related to the sexual abuse of kids			1
as important , we will soon roll out these changes in more than 150 languages , so the impact will be truly global			0
deterrence : we 're now showing warnings – from both @entity3 and charities – at the top of our search results for more than 13,000 queries			2
these alerts make clear that child sexual abuse is illegal and offer advice on where to get help			1
detection and removal : there 's no quick technical fix when it comes to detecting child sexual abuse imagery			1
this is because computers ca n't reliably distinguish between innocent pictures of kids at bathtime and genuine abuse			0
so we always need to have a person review the images			0
once that is done – and we know the pictures are illegal – each image is given a unique digital fingerprint			0
u-turn : internet search results linked to child abuse are to be blocked across the world by @entity3 this enables our computers to identify those pictures whenever they appear on our systems			1
and @entity31 deserves a lot of credit for developing and sharing its picture detection technology			0
but paedophiles are increasingly filming their crimes			0
so our engineers at @entity108 have created a new technology to identify these videos			0
we 're already testing it at @entity3 , and in the new year we hope to make it available to other internet companies and child safety organisations			2
technical expertise : there are many organisations working to fight the sexual exploitation of kids online – and we want to ensure they have the best technical support			2
so @entity3 plans to second computer engineers to both the @entity122 ( @entity122 ) here in @entity123 and the @entity124 ( @entity125 )			2
we also plan to fund internships for other engineers at these organisations			0
this will help the @entity122 and @entity125 stay one step ahead			0
the sexual abuse of children is a global challenge , and success depends on everyone working together – law enforcement , internet companies and charities			1
we welcome the lead taken by the @entity123 government , and hope that the technologies developed ( and shared ) by our industry will make a real difference in the fight against this terrible crime .			1

we should do everything in our power to protect children from harm
@entity3 has more than 200 people working to tackle the problem
it actively removes child sexual abuse imagery from our services
the company welcomes the lead taken by the @entity123 government
