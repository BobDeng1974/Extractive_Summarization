the desperate father then walked into the the @entity87 - without an appointment - and showed his investigations to @entity46 special agent @entity109			0
agent @entity109 immediately started on the case and , at the end of 2013 , it all paid off			0
in december , @entity113 told the @entity65 @entity114 : ' i ’ve lived this moment in my head for 18 months and to actually have it come true and be able to pick him up , bring him home , put him in my bed ... it ’s unbelievable			0
' yet @entity12 says that she wants her sons back and is planning to return to @entity65 in the near future			0
on @entity50 's 20/20 on friday night the tearful mother she said that is willing to face criminal charges back in the @entity16 if it means a chance of getting some custody of the children			1

‘ i was really nervous about how much @entity13 would remember because he was only three when he was taken , and i knew he 'd be seeing me for the first time totally out of context in @entity18 , ’ mr @entity8 recalled to the paper			1
