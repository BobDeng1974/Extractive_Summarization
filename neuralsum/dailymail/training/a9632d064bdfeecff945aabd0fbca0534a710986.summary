by @entity0 if @entity6 wins the world championship , he can send the cheque to me , c / o of the @entity5 , lo and behold , his bulldogs @entity2 and @entity3 have been confined to kennels			1
they will not be here at the @entity14 @entity13 , on the instruction , it is said , of @entity16 , his boss at @entity18			1
we remember the cries of criticism when we gently nudged him to the view that going around with a couple of dogs was not the sort of thing that a first - rank sportsman did			2
leave them at home , we urged , for your own good			2
so indignant were @entity18 at the comment - well - intentioned though it was - that they banned this newspaper from @entity6 ’s press briefings			1
taking the lead : @entity18 driver @entity6 walks with his dog in @entity39 but here , ahead of the @entity14 @entity13 , the fifth race of a season that @entity6 is dominating with the brilliance of his driving , this admission came			1
‘ the first load of races ( @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 ) were just so far for the dogs to travel			2
‘ i imagine it ’s a bit than having kids to move around - all these jabs you have to get the dogs , the passports			2
it ’s just been simpler to have them with my family			2
at the moment , it ’s just me and my trainer			2
’ the one - eyed @entity6 fans saw the suggestion that he keep his dogs at home as some serious insult			1
it was a suggestion made to help the most talented driver of his generation - the fastest driver in the world , possibly of all time - at a time when his then then new team , @entity18 , exercised no control over him to his own detriment			0
had @entity6 ’s father , @entity80 , been in control of him there is no way he would have countenanced the notion of dogs being carted around the world as if they were @entity89 luggage			1
brilliant : @entity6 has won three of the first four races this season focused : @entity6 sits in his car in the garage during practice ahead of the @entity14 @entity13 it is a firm belief here that @entity6 ’s behaviour last year was a transitional phase : he was trying to find out who he was after years in the narrow tunnel of @entity101 ’s tutelage and his father ’s massively controlling influence			1
@entity18 hailed the extravagance of @entity6 ’s behaviour as a sign of his greater maturity			1
it was his rebellion against a strait - jacket			0
what we see now in @entity112 this year - 12 months and more after his move from @entity101 to @entity18 - is perhaps getting close to a settled position			1
he is freer of mind and more relaxed in his own skin			0
@entity6 is doing what he has always done : drive sensationally well			1
but despite having won the last three races , he is trailing @entity119 by four points			0
a mechanical failure at the first race in @entity47 cost him in the standings			0
he was brilliantly dominant again on friday in practice			1
he was fastest in both sessions , on the first time occasion nine - tenths of a second ahead of @entity128 ’s @entity101 and then half a second in front of his @entity18 team - mate @entity119			1
setting the pace : @entity6 was fastest in both sessions on friday ‘ it ’s been a great day today and i ’m happy to be back in the car after what feels like quite a long break , ’ he said			1
‘ i can feel the positive step forward that we ’ve made with the car , so a big thank you to everyone back at our factories for all of their hard work since @entity50			0
‘ i ’ve not had such a good friday for a very long time			2
it ’s very difficult to overtake in @entity145 so we will do everything we can to qualify as high as possible tomorrow			0
‘ but really it is all about the race and looking after those tyres			0
finally , it ’s great to see so many fans here today enjoying the action in this beautiful weather			0
’ after his blazing start , @entity128 slipped back to sixth fastest in the afternoon , his @entity101 less than wonderful			1
he said : ‘ the afternoon was where we expected to be			0
this morning was good and we were quicker than expected			0
i do n’t think it ’s anywhere near as good as it looked earlier			0
‘ this morning we looked a lot quicker , maybe because of temperatures and fuel loads			0
’ never mind fuel loads , or indeed anything else			0
unless @entity6 ’s @entity18 blows up , he is on for victory here			2
the dog-less star is simply way , way , way ahead of everyone .			0
