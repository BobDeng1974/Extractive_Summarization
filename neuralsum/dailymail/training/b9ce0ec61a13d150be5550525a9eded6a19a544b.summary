by @entity0 an mp has hit out at claims @entity4 's appearances on a @entity6 bar crawl will aid her recovery from depression - branding her jaunts to @entity10 ' the most outrageous back to work programme i ’ve ever heard of '			1
the @entity14 star is continuing to claim handouts despite announcing plans to join revellers at a second ' @entity6 ' night next month			1
she 'll appear at the event unpaid in a move her agent says will help her shake off the depression that prevents her from finding paid employment			1
@entity4 has agreed to appear at another @entity6 night in june after she was pictured downing shots in the party resort last month her agent says the trip is one of a number planned for @entity4 over the summer to ' get her used to going to work ' @entity4 enjoys a laugh back home in @entity14 , @entity31 yesterday ahead of her planned trips abroad agent @entity33 said : ' like anyone who goes to work , she has to get used to being away from her street , from her kids , and that is what she is doing now			1
' but mp @entity39 has blasted the arrangement , which he says undermines public faith in the benefits system			1
mr @entity39 told @entity43 : ' this is the most outrageous back to work programme i 've ever heard of			1
' we need to restore public confidence in the welfare state and cases like this show why so many people believe it is n't working			0
' if she 's fit enough to be doing promotional work in @entity55 then she 's surely fit enough to get a job			0
they should stop her benefits now			2
' single mother - of - two @entity4 , real name @entity14 , sparked public anger by downing shots and cocktails as she ' headlined ' her first night at the party resort last month			2
during her last trip to @entity10 , she was spotted kissing a young fan on a sun lounger after she was a huge hit with revellers , bar crawl organisers carnage @entity6 have now booked her to appear at another night next month she was photographed sipping champagne during the trip , but later claimed she ' hated the stuff ' it was announced this week that the 42 - year - old will appear before party - goers on another ' @entity14 - themed night ' on june 27			1
but - as the trip is being funded by her agent @entity77 will continue to claim the estimated £ 10,000 - a - year she gets in handouts including @entity79 ( @entity79 )			1
mr @entity39 contrasted @entity4 's case to that of @entity83 's @entity82 , who was given a public apology from the government after she was sent a letter by benefits bosses demanding she find work - despite being in a coma following a heart attack			1
he said : ' it 's frankly insulting that i have a constituent in a coma that the government are hassling while @entity4 is galavanting around @entity96 and making a mockery of the system			2
' @entity99 mp @entity39 has called for @entity4 's benefits to be stopped to restore public faith in the system the @entity103 has also called on authorities to ensure state support is only going to those who need it			1
campaign manager @entity108 said : ' @entity79 is rightly there to help some of the most vulnerable people in society who are in need of extra support			0
' of course no - one in receipt of @entity79 should be denied the opportunity to enjoy themselves , but rigorous systems need to be in place to ensure that those receiving taxpayer - funded benefits genuinely require them			2
' the authorities need to make sure that nobody is making unnecessary claims on the welfare system			2
' but @entity4 's agent , mr @entity33 , has claimed the holidays will benefit the taxpayer in the long run			0
he said : ' this is not someone with a broken foot , this is a condition she 's had for several years			0
i guarantee by the end of this i will have her working and she will be paying tax			0
' the @entity138 has refused to say whether it will investigate the arrangement , insisting it never comments on individual cases			0
but a spokesman said : ' if we receive information or evidence which suggests a claimant is being paid in kind for work , the @entity138 has powers to treat this as earnings and this may affect their entitlement to @entity79			0
' a four - night stay in june at the hotel where @entity6 takes place currently costs around £ 650 , with the cheapest return flights from @entity31 to @entity10 for that weekend going for around £ 150			1
when @entity4 's food and drink are factored in , it is estimated she could be enjoying what amounts to a £ 1,000 holiday while continuing to claim benefits			2
but mr @entity33 added : ' this is not payment in kind			0
it is the same as if a friend of @entity4 's invited her to @entity170 for the weekend , that would n't affect her benefits			0
' she is not claiming @entity172 so she does not need to sign on , she has to go to a doctor once a month			0
' i 've talked to the doctor to check it is safe to take her away and we 've been in contact with the @entity138 and told them what we are doing			0

reality *tv* star set to return to @entity10 to headline ' @entity6 ' night
despite her second appearance at event , she 'll continue to get benefits
her agent insists she is not breaking any rules and will soon be earning
he told @entity43 : ' she has to get used to being away from her street '
but mp @entity39 says her actions ' make a mockery of the system '
