the brave lady has now teamed up with ' @entity12 ' to help provide cancer sufferers across the @entity14 with lightweight artificial breasts made from cotton			1
after being sent her own ' knitted knockers ' , @entity7 decided to help women up and down the country who have also suffered the @entity21 are made by volunteers , in any size , and offer a much lighter and more breathable alternative to silicone prosthesis @entity7 , from @entity26 , @entity27 , said : ‘ after my double mastectomy i had a lot of time on my hands because i was off work for a while			1
‘ i belong to a few support groups online for breast cancer and one linked to an @entity36 website about knitted knockers			1
‘ i thought that sounded interesting so i ordered a pair of these knitted knockers			1
‘ even though it was an @entity36 website , a few ladies in @entity41 belong to it and it was the ladies in @entity41 who sent me a pair of knockers			1
‘ i thought they were great , they were absolutely fantastic			0
they are comfortable to wear against your skin and scars and everything			0
’ @entity7 was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2011 and underwent a lumpectomy and chemotherapy to remove it			1
however , she tested positive for the brca gene last year which drastically increased the chances of the cancer returning			0
to mitigate the chances she underwent a double mastectomy , as well as having her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed			1

@entity7 says the group has also helped her through a difficult time after losing her brother ‘ because of me she started the group up in the @entity14 which i think is a lovely thing to have done			2
‘ i had to get involved - i learnt how to knit and crochet them and i 'm now quite involved			0
' hospitals in the @entity14 provide us with prosthetic ones , which are okay , but they are quite heavy			0
i 've got the hospital silicon ones - and just one weighs 450 grams , and that is just a c cup			0
‘ but one of my knitted ones weighs less than 50 grams			0
you compare 450 grams and 50 grams in your bra and what would you prefer ? ‘ it is nice to have a choice , especially for comfort reasons			0
in hot weather , the knitted cotton ones - we make them out of 100 per cent pure cotton - are a lot more comfortable because they do n't make you sweat like with the silicon ones			2
’ taking a few hours to make each pair , they can be made in sizes aa to @entity105 , with ladies requesting either one or a pair of knockers depending on what operation they have had			2

they buy the cotton themselves , knit , stuff , package and post - all for free			0
