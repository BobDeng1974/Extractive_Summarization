the @entity2 ’s @entity1 sack is coming but this year it is not only the usual suspects who are feeling the big chill			0
by seasonal custom it is the humble basement bosses in the @entity9 who check whether their @entity11 come through the letter box with the greetings cards			0
now , if not facing festive dismissal quite yet , one or two of the big boys are beginning to sense that the skids could be under them			0
@entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 looks dejected after a week of disappointment in @entity23 @entity23 is the destination of choice for the major clubs but when @entity29 matches go the way they have in the past few days these can be perilous journeys for the managers			2
who would have thought , as recently as a week ago , that @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 would be planning extra helpings not of turkey and @entity1 pudding but hard tack			0
let us consider them in turn : @entity43 spent the latter part of this wednesday evening confessing that his costly @entity45 have lost nerve , faith , confidence and , potentially most damaging of all for himself , trust			1
just one win in five matches speaks to the truth of that self - wounding assessment and had that solitary victory not come against @entity55 then @entity33 would be on even slipperier ground already			2
@entity33 has won just one of his last five games as @entity45 have started to stumble @entity59 ( centre ) did the damage with @entity63 's goals in their 2 - 1 win over @entity45 how far have the @entity66 champions fallen ? as low as losing at home to a distinctly ordinary @entity63 and having two of their prima donnas sent off during that humiliating process			1
@entity33 answers to foreign owners who regard the @entity29 as the @entity73			2
city captain @entity74 looks disappointed at the end of the defeat by @entity63 @entity45 ’s prospects of surviving a relatively easy group depend now on @entity79 , who have already qualified , either sending their reserves to the @entity82 or treating that fixture as a practice match			1
@entity86 whiled away his tuesday evening watching @entity87 throw away a three - goal lead at home against the @entity91 lightweights of @entity92			1
the boos rained down in @entity94 as he turned away from the scene of that debacle			0
the fans , let alone the directors , can see that this team are , quite literally , defenceless			0
even the most respectful of former players are beginning to query why the manager has not bought top - class centre - backs			2
it looked as if @entity34 would have an easy night when @entity87 went 3 - 0 up against @entity92 ... but the @entity87 manager could hardly look as his side threw away their three - goal lead at the @entity107 that question would be asked with greater urgency right now if @entity87 were not still in position to go through to the last 16			1
for the moment , it is being conveniently forgotten that @entity34 ’s esoteric ensemble would be scrambling to advance had they not been fortunate enough to pull a last - gasp victory out of a wretched performance at @entity92 in the preceding match			1
as it is they are looking at second place , yet again , with its implicit danger of a deadly draw in the next round			0
and , like @entity45 , they have not started the @entity9 season at all well			2
@entity87 pair @entity124 and @entity21 look dejected after throwing away a three goal lead the @entity87 board are historically patient and respectful of @entity34 , who achieved so much in his early years there			1
but for how much longer ? @entity128 , @entity34			0
@entity129 , meanwhile , splashed through only the first half of his sudden watershed on tuesday			0
by scorning the highest @entity133 tradition with his decision to send a weakened @entity136 team into @entity138 ’s fabled @entity137 , this manager has impaled himself on the imperative of his rested first - teamers defeating @entity141 at @entity142 this weekend			1
or at least avoiding defeat			0
if @entity136 lose this one – and slump even further adrift of the @entity9 leaders – the carrion will make a meal of @entity35 come saturday lunchtime			2
@entity35 made seven changes to the @entity136 side he sent out to face @entity138 if so , that feast will come early			1
@entity35 was so recently hailed as the saviour of @entity142 that a descent into doubt this soon seemed impossible			0
he is bringing it in part upon himself			0
far be it from a sportswriter to advise a manager to turn off the quotes tap but @entity35 really needs to put thinking time between brain and mouth			0
as an example of his tendency to damage himself , how about this cracker at the dinner in may at which the @entity170 of the game was dubiously installed as our @entity173 : ‘ i am a better person for knowing @entity164			0
’ in the end @entity35 and @entity136 only lost to the @entity133 champions by one goal nor , judging from his jocular appearance at subsequent training , does he understand even now the implications of a club of @entity136 ’s @entity133 pedigree playing for damage limitation rather than glory at the @entity137			1
among the chorus of disapproval , one @entity142 legend asked : ‘ what is the point of making qualification for next season ’s @entity29 the priority when you are playing @entity138 this week ? ’ @entity35 , in training with @entity194 , appeared to be over the @entity138 defeat at training on thursday morning that is not a question which will sit comfortably on his cv if ever he tries to pursue his professed ambition to manage in the upper echelons of @entity202			1
worse still if @entity136 go out to – er - @entity203			1
despite being held to a draw in @entity206 by the moderates of @entity208 , @entity141 ’s @entity204 is iceberg proof this winter			0
not only is he virtually certain of reaching the @entity29 last 16 but @entity141 are top of the @entity9			2
@entity204 is sitting pretty in @entity23 despite a midweek draw and his team are flying high in the league however , the @entity66 game at large needs higher quality performances from @entity141 as much as from @entity45 , @entity87 and @entity136 ... and @entity55 for that matter			1
this @entity29 week – and not for the first time - has not cast the @entity9 in a flattering light			2
@entity141 's @entity218 celebrates his goal with teammates during the draw with @entity208 the best league in the world ? not even close unless the marquee clubs raise their game considerably , starting this weekend with @entity136 and @entity141 putting on a spectacle , @entity45 and @entity55 dazzling @entity227 and @entity228 respectively and @entity87 grafting substance onto style at @entity231 .			1

@entity45 are bottom of their @entity29 group after losing at home to @entity63
@entity136 made seven changes and lost 1 - 0 to *holders* @entity138
@entity87 threw away a three goal lead against @entity91 side @entity92
