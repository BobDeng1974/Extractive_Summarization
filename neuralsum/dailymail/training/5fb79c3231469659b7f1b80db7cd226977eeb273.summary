by @entity0 published : 08:24 est , 24 october 2013 updated : 08:25 est , 24 october 2013 @entity1 is a tricky business			0
a tiny push at a skewed angle can send an astronaut floating off in the wrong direction			0
even a single strand of hair can be enough to propel a body away from a surface , as @entity12 astronaut @entity11 recently demonstrated			2
in a video created to explain the effects of weightlessness , @entity11 used one strand of her own hair to send herself tumbling away from a wall of the @entity19 ( @entity19 )			1
’ ‘ one of the things she told her about was how little effort it took to move around in microgravity , ’ said @entity11 , who has been at the @entity19 since may			1
‘ she even told her that you could take a human hair and use it stretched out to push against a wall or a handrail – and it really takes that little effort			2
’ veteran astronaut @entity42 floated some ideas about how @entity27 could portray an astronaut for blockbuster gravity ‘ since i have the resources , i thought i would give it a try , ’ added @entity11 in a video posted by @entity12			1
after plucking one hair , she pressed it against an @entity19 handrail and fell backwards in slow motion			1
@entity27 sought tips for portraying microgravity from @entity56 , who ’s logged more than 4,330 hours in space aboard the @entity59 and the @entity19			2
@entity56 would n’t be qualified to talk about the terror of floating off into space , as luckily she ’s never experienced it			0
but she was able to field @entity27 ’s questions about how it feels to be an astronaut			0
in a video created to explain the effects of weightlessness , @entity11 used one strand of her own hair to send herself tumbling away from a wall of the @entity19 ( pictured ) she told @entity71 : ‘ she wanted to know about what it is like to physically live up there and physically move around			1
‘ “ what would you do with your hands ? with your feet ? what would be a natural position to work ? how often do you see your crewmates ? where do you meet each other ? " it was those kinds of things			0
’ @entity56 has seen the trailer to @entity87 and describes the scene where dr @entity89 is sent spinning into the void as sensationalism , but admitted to @entity71 that the film is valuable as it portrays ' real people , including women , doing a difficult job ' .			0

@entity11 wanted to show how little effort it takes to move in space
video shows how , after plucking one hair and pressing it against an @entity19 handrail , @entity11 tumbles backwards in slow motion
experiment was *inspired* by a conversation fellow astronaut @entity26 had with @entity27 , star of the film space thriller ‘ gravity ’
