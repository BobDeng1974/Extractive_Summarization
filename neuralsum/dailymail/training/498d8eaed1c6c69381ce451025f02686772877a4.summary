@entity0 insists he is not bothered that he is yet to be offered a new contract by @entity2 , despite his current deal running out at the end of the season			1
@entity2 have had their best start to the @entity7 since @entity0 brought them back up two years ago and are fourth in the table			1

@entity0 said he is not bothered that he is yet to be offered a contract extension by @entity2 with just two games remaining – and their survival secured – he agreed to a new two - year extension in may , but that will have run its course by the end of this campaign			1
@entity0 said : ' the conversations are the same as what they were in the first year in the @entity7			1
' we 'll see how the season progresses , when the time is right			2
if it has progressed to a certain level that they want to offer a new contract , that 's fine			1

contracts are made and broken in the entire football industry			0
it does n't mean anything like it used to			0
a long or short contract does n't protect you			2
' it 's a winning culture you need , if you continue to win you improve the club			2
it 's a slow process you have to go through , you build something that 's sustainable			0
it looks like in year four we are doing that			0
' we 've grown the squad into what looks more sustainable			0
only way to do that is to get results			0
