any moment now there will surely be a press release issued by the @entity4 camp in which the man himself reveals an online account was hacked and words purporting to come from him were actually a spoof			1
that can be the only rational response to an extraordinary over-reaction from @entity4 to a low - grade piece of parody in the latest issue of @entity17			1
in his take on an ‘ interview ’ in the magazine that makes clear in the headline it is fake and therefore satirical , @entity4 actually manages to come across as more deranged than the one parodied			1
@entity4 ( right ) took exception to a parody of the golf star in the latest issue of @entity17 magazine the article in question was penned by revered @entity32 golf writer @entity31 talk about truth being stranger than fiction			1
in a blog on a website called @entity38 ’ @entity37 , @entity4 labels the piece a ‘ grudge - fuelled piece of character assassination ’ and follows it with an amazing statement : ‘ journalistically and ethically , can you sink any lower ? ’ talk about losing the plot completely			1
@entity4 hits a shot on the 12th hole during the second round 96th at the @entity49 in august let us emphasise the piece is wholly unfunny , drawing upon tired cliches about @entity4 — that he has no mates , does not like tipping — and mocks his scandal - ridden past ad nauseam			1
but not being very good is the worst charge you can make , given the lengths which the headline goes to stress the interview is not genuine			0
ethically , it steps into no grey area whatsoever			0
trouble is , it was written by @entity31 , the most celebrated golf writer in @entity32			1
@entity31 is 84 and has been to more than 220 major championships			1
he once failed to name @entity4 in his all - time top five , which might be why , in @entity4 ’s world , he suspects a ‘ grudge ’			1
but most people would consider it an opinion to which @entity31 is more than entitled			1
@entity4 hits his tee shot on the 11th hole during the second round of the tournament in @entity77 @entity17 reacted the only way a proper magazine could to cries from the @entity4 camp for an apology			1
they promoted it to become the lead article on their website			2
this could now become the most read piece @entity31 has written for several decades — a shame , given the many brilliant ones he has penned			1
the vast majority of people , i predict , will get about halfway through and wonder what possessed @entity93 to react in the way he did			0
or maybe that press release saying his account was hacked is still winging its way through the ether			0
meanwhile , it is back down to @entity102 — the name of the course that will host the @entity106 ’s season finale , the @entity107 , starting on thursday			1
the race to @entity109 might be run , but with the tour ’s finest all in attendance , there ’s no reason why the greatest season in the history of @entity117 golf should not get an appropriate send - off			2
for a start there are so many among the cast of 60 for whom a win in this event would change the entire complexion of their season			0
@entity128 plays a shot in the practice round ahead of the forthcoming @entity107 take @entity128			2
right now , he is looking at 2014 the way somebody does a bit of dog poo on the sole of their shoe			0
but a victory here and he would finish second behind the race to @entity109 winner @entity141 with a seven - figure cheque in his pocket			2
it could happen , too			0
all those months of pent - up frustration have suddenly been eased by a couple of good tournaments in a row			2
who knows what might happen following his conversation with the @entity153 legend @entity152 on tuesday night , about putting technique			0
@entity128 should have won the @entity155 last week , given he led by six shots at one stage			0
he even missed from 6ft on the final green to force a play - off			0
@entity128 recently met with @entity153 legend @entity152 , pictured with his wife @entity160 watching at home , @entity152 believed he knew why and tweeted as much			0
naturally , @entity128 followed that up with a phone call and spent much of yesterday on the practice putting green trying to work out if @entity152 was right			0
‘ it was really nice of @entity152 to reach out but i ’ve been working hard on my putting and i feel like i ’ve made good inroads , ’ said @entity128			2
‘ obviously a couple of key putts have slipped past but i ’d like to review them myself as well as having a great opinion from @entity152			0
so i will let you know what conclusion i reached on sunday night			0
how about that ? ’ @entity128 has a good record here , having lost a play - off in 2010 to @entity177 , while he was pipped by another @entity178 , @entity179 , last year			2
the man they will all have to beat , of course , is the one @entity179 will accompany on the first tee just after @entity184 here today			0
as @entity4 descends beyond parody , we should be ever more thankful for the contrasting example set by his successor as the world ’s best player , @entity141 .			1

@entity4 labels parody piece as a ‘ grudge - fuelled piece of character assassination ’
the article in question was written by @entity32 golf writer @entity31
