by @entity0 published : 15:59 est , 3 february 2014 @entity2 : 18:45 est , 3 february 2014 former @entity4 senator @entity3 has sparked more rumors that he is seriously considering running for office in @entity7 after taking part in a polar bear plunge over the weekend			1
the @entity10 has been actively playing coy with voters and political analysts in recent months , but he stripped the issue bare in his most recent move			1
a picture of the shirtless former senator made the front page of the local newspaper as he took part in the @entity19 , @entity7 annual @entity20 that raises money for the @entity22			2
this is not the first time that the @entity10 has stripped down for a cause , as he once posed for @entity46 while he was a student in an effort to help pay for law school			1
when he did cover up at sunday 's race , he made clear that his patriotic roots are still intact , as he posted a picture of himself wearing an @entity36 flag sweatshirt while standing next to two men dressed in full walking - dead garb as part of the plunge 's zombie theme			0
@entity3 's appearance surely helped him raise some of the $ 600,000 that the event collected for the @entity22 , but it also did some good for his future political aspirations			0
video by @entity62 defeat : @entity63 bumped @entity3 from the @entity27 seat in 2012 ( seen here during the campaign ) competition : if he chooses to run in @entity7 , he will be facing @entity69 senator @entity68 , who has held the seat for the past two terms since 2002 after winning a @entity4 special election in 2010 following senator @entity73 's death , @entity3 left the @entity27 two years later when he was beaten by @entity69 challenger , @entity63			2
@entity75 is now seen as a @entity69 rising star on the national stage , and the chances of being re-elected in her left - leaning state are fairly high			0
in turn , @entity3 has been spending more time at his vacation home in @entity83 , @entity7			2
aside from the lovely scenery , it is also convenient that the state 's @entity69 senator @entity68 is up for re-election this year			0
while signs might be pointing to a possible senate run , @entity3 - who signed on as a @entity92 contributor after being voted out of office - has kept hinting at his viability as a presidential candidate in 2016			0
back in the day : @entity3 's 1982 @entity46 centerfold helped him pay for law school happy husband : at @entity99 , @entity3 shared this picture of he and his wife @entity101			1

the former @entity103 has been playing coy about possibly running for office in @entity7
he attended a *charity* polar plunge in @entity7 this weekend and opted to go shirtless even though it was a high of 44 degrees
not the first time that he has stripped down and was featured as a @entity46 centerfold when he was in law school
