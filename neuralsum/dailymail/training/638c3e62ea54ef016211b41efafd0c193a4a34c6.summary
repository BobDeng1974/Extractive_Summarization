by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 has admitted @entity3 are expecting no favours from @entity5 after @entity6 plunged them to the brink of @entity9 elimination			1
the @entity11 striker underwent knee surgery 28 days ago but he returned from injury to score twice , capitalising on defensive errors as @entity15 won 2 - 1 in @entity16 and leave @entity17 needing a minor miracle for @entity3 to continue in the tournament			1
@entity3 can still qualify for the knockout stages if @entity5 beat @entity21 tomorrow and then follow up with victory against @entity15 next tuesday ; @entity3 would then need to beat @entity21 in @entity23 to save themselves			2
video - scroll down to see @entity3 fans left distraught after @entity15 defeat dejected : @entity2 leaves the field at full time after @entity3 fell to a late @entity6 winner in @entity16 left standing : @entity2 can only watch on as @entity6 scores @entity15 's opener in the @entity29 but judging by the reaction of @entity2 and the rest of @entity3 ’s players as they trudged off following a defeat that former manager @entity35 - speaking as a pundit on @entity38 - insisted was avoidable , it seems they have already accepted their fate			1
@entity2 said : ‘ it ’s gutting , i think			2
we played so well again in spells but unfortunately if a little bit of luck had gone our way ... if @entity47 ( @entity48 ) had n’t ended up flicking the ball on , @entity6 would n’t have been on side			1
you just hope that he miss - hits it but he finds the target and they win the game			0
’ when asked if @entity6 was the difference , @entity2 replied : ‘ the pass for the first goal was pretty decent			1
it was a similar story to the other night			0
we played pretty well at times but in the end we were not good enough			2
up against the best : @entity2 wins this battle with @entity6 but @entity3 's defence twice conceded to him heads , you lose : @entity6 comes out on the losing side of this aerial duel with the @entity67 centre back ‘ it ’s very disappointing			1
the last thing you want to see as a defender is a punt down the pitch and then a flick on and a goal			0
we are absolutely devastated in there			0
we had them on the back foot			0
we just could n’t get the second goal			0
‘ there is a small chance i suppose ( of @entity5 winning their next two games ) but we are not exactly expecting anything like that to happen			0
we have got to go out there , put a good performance in and make sure we get something against @entity21			0
’ double trouble : it was n't just @entity6 the @entity3 defence had to worry about , @entity91 was there too			1

@entity3 centre back believes @entity17 's side played well in spells
*squad* are devastated by the nature of the loss , @entity2 says
@entity6 scored twice to put @entity3 on the brink of elimination
