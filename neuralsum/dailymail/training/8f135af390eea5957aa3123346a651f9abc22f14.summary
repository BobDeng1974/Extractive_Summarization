by @entity0 follow @ @ the_topspin @entity2 cricket writer @entity0 's view of day two of the third test between @entity4 and @entity5 at the @entity6 , which saw @entity7 score 167 to move into the top 10 @entity4 run scorers			1
@entity7 moved into the top 10 on @entity4 ’s all - time run - scoring list with his sublime 167 , easing out @entity11 along the way			1
@entity7 now has 7,068 runs			0
his 21st @entity15 ton drew him level with @entity11 , and pulled him clear of @entity16 and @entity17			0
big hitter : @entity7 's 167 against @entity5 took him past 7,000 test runs @entity4 finally clear the rope @entity7 passed 7,000 with a straight six off @entity21			1
it was the first of six sixes @entity4 hit during the afternoon — with @entity7 and debutant @entity24 launching three each — and the first six they had managed all series			2
@entity5 , by contrast , managed seven sixes in the first two tests			0
@entity30 knocked out by another bouncer fast bowlers will have taken note of @entity35 ’s latest dismissal , caught at second slip after toe - ending an attempted pull off @entity37			0
slowly does it ! @entity35 has fallen to a fast bowler for the third time in this series against @entity5 it ’s the third time in the series @entity44 has been undone by the bouncer , after turning his back at both @entity47 and @entity48 , and spooning catches off his glove			1
lady luck has smiled on @entity52 @entity53 was unlucky to have been given out caught behind off his hip after being beaten by an off - break from @entity56 , but @entity4 have enjoyed good fortune in this @entity15			1
@entity58 was dropped on 15 , @entity7 could have been out lbw for a duck , @entity53 was possibly caught behind on 10 , while @entity24 survived an appeal for a slip catch before he had scored			2
great escape : @entity53 ( c ) was one of several @entity4 batsmen to have decisions go their way @entity67 's innings of 156 means he has now scored 364 runs in the series at an average of 91			1
that is more than anyone on either side , with @entity77 opener @entity75 in second place , way behind on 328			0
@entity4 ’s @entity80 , in third , is even further behind — on 236			0
@entity83 opener @entity81 was the star of the show when his team won the @entity86 in @entity4 last summer			0
but his dismissal last night for six at the @entity6 , caught at first slip by @entity58 off @entity89 , took his series tally to 85 runs in five knocks — and @entity89 has now removed him cheaply in three first innings out of three			2
