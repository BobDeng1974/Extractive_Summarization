he was diagnosed with @entity14 , or @entity14 , sunday night			1
it is a respiratory illness that begins with flu - like fever and cough but can lead to shortness of breath , pneumonia and death			0
he arrived there with relatively mild symptoms , is stable and doing well fortunately , the @entity4 cases so far have not been severe			1
the first case , a man in @entity33 , was released from a hospital late last week			1
and the second patient is doing well , officials said			0
the two cases are not linked , officials said			0
' the risk to the public remains very low , ' said dr. @entity40 of the @entity41			1
@entity14 is a respiratory illness that begins with flu - like fever and cough but can lead to shortness of breath , pneumonia and death			1
most cases have been in @entity9 or elsewhere in the @entity6			0
but earlier this month a first @entity4 case was diagnosed in a man who traveled from @entity9 to @entity33			1
that man , an @entity4 , was a health - care worker at a hospital in @entity9 's capital city who flew to the @entity4 on april 24 on a plane that originated in @entity58 , stopped in @entity59 and then landed in @entity60			1
the man took a bus to @entity63 , @entity33 where he became sick and went to a hospital on april 28			1
he improved and was released from a @entity63 hospital on friday			2
tests of people who were around the man have all proved negative , health officials have said			0
contagion : this map shows the route that the man hospitalized currently in @entity13 traveled after contracting @entity14 the first case , discovered in @entity33 on may 2 , involved a male health care worker who was living and working in @entity9 who fell ill on his return to the @entity4 health officials now must track down fellow travelers who were around the newest case , and this time it will be more challenging : there were more flights involved			1
this man also was a health - care worker at a hospital where @entity14 cases were being treated , the @entity41 said			1
he traveled on may 1 on flights from @entity88 , @entity9 , first to @entity59 , then to @entity89 , then to @entity90 , and finally to @entity13			2
he went to a hospital on may 8 and was placed in isolation			0
the first flight was @entity95 flight 113 to @entity59 , according to a @entity97 press release			0
the @entity4 government did not identify the flight information for the other legs			2
health officials did not immediately release additional detail about his travels or his week in @entity10 , except to say he was not at any theme parks and remained in the @entity13 area to see family			1
the man is at @entity27 in @entity13			2
he arrived there with relatively mild symptoms , is stable and doing well , but there is no timetable for his release , said @entity115 , a spokesman for @entity10 's health department			2
as early as the first flight , the latest case was suffering fever , chills and a slight cough			0
that does n't necessarily mean he infected anyone			0
experts think @entity14 cases are most infectious when they are severely ill , with symptoms like pneumonia and difficulty breathing , @entity40 said			1
@entity41 : @entity41 spokesman dr. @entity129 has announced there has been a second detected case of @entity14 in the @entity4 however , health officials are trying to contact as many as 500 people who were on the three flights within the @entity4 to let them know the situation and watch for symptoms			1
people on the flight from @entity88 to @entity59 also will be contacted , @entity41 officials said			2
@entity14 belongs to the coronavirus family that includes the common cold and @entity25 , or severe acute respiratory syndrome , which caused some 800 deaths globally in 2003			2
the @entity14 virus has been found in camels , but officials do n't know how it is spreading to humans			1
it can spread from person to person , but officials believe that happens only after close contact			0
not all those exposed to the virus become ill. but it appears to be unusually lethal — some estimates have suggested it has killed nearly a third of the people it sickened			2
the estimate has been dropping as health officials have begun diagnosing more and more cases with less severe illness			0
but the estimated fatality rate for @entity14 still is far higher than what 's seen with seasonal flu or other routine infections			0
fortunately , it is not as contagious as flu , measles or other diseases			0
there is no vaccine or cure and there 's no specific treatment except to relieve symptoms			0
overall , 538 people have been reported to have the respiratory illness , including 145 people who have died			0
so far , all had ties to the @entity6 region or to people who traveled there			0
as many as one - fifth of cases have been in health - care workers , @entity40 said .			0

second case of @entity14 detected in @entity13 , @entity10 announces the @entity41
no details on the patient who contracted the virus not where they contracted it
described as ' *imported* ' - which means that the patient became ill outside of the @entity4
comes days after first patient to fall ill with the virus was released from hospital in @entity33
@entity14 stands for @entity14
the strange virus is *incredibly* lethal
