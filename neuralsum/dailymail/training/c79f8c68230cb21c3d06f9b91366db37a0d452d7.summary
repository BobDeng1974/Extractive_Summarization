' there are other holy people who have worked here , ' said @entity48 , president for chi @entity49 in @entity51 , a social service agency @entity52 founded			0
' but this would be a saint [ who ] started institutions in @entity9 that are still in operation			0
' @entity10 , a nun with the @entity57 , came to @entity58 , @entity35 , in 1877 to teach poor children and was later transferred to @entity60 , where she co-founded public and catholic schools			1
miracle : @entity3 had several encounters with @entity20 , who stopped him killing four doctors and prevented him from robbing a wagon during her time in @entity9 , she worked with the poor , the sick and immigrants			1
she also advocated on behalf of @entity69 and native americans who were losing their land			0
