' he 's a hoop junkie , i 've played with him			0
i 've seen @entity2 players play with him			0
there 's a lot of @entity2 players that support him , ' @entity40 said			0
but @entity1 proved he was no sycophant , interrupting the starry - eyed host by stating bluntly , ' he 's not that good			1
' @entity40 could n't stand the criticism , ' he 's pretty good , he 's got a nice little crossover , ' he insisted			0
air ball : president @entity9 tosses a signed basketball given to him by the 2012 @entity64 championship @entity63 men 's basketball team during a @entity67 visit on may 4 no pain , no gain : president @entity9 injured himself during a fierce basketball game on november 26 , 2010			1

' i 'm a loyal @entity49 okay , a passionate @entity49			1
he 's not as good as he thinks he is , ' @entity1 added , showing that when it comes to basketball , political persuasion does n't count for much			2

' he relates well to our players			0
he 's got a lot of people around him who are b - ball fans ... the players appreciate him for who is , ' he conceded			0

the elite members of this group include @entity9 's brother - in - law , @entity101 , the men 's basketball coach at @entity104 , the president 's former aide or ' body man ' @entity107 , who played for @entity110 's @entity109 basketball team , and secretary of education @entity111 , who played for @entity113 and even went pro in @entity114 for a time			2
do n't quit your day job : @entity2 commissioner @entity1 says despite @entity9 's enthusiasm for the game , he really is n't that good high praise : host @entity40 complimented president @entity9 for his basketball moves when his schedule allows , the president joins an exclusive group of players who congregate in the @entity127 for some serious pick - up			1

guys on his team dribbled past him and ignored the fact he was wide open			0
when he drives through the streets , crowds part , but when he drives to the basket large , hostile men slide over to cut him off , ' @entity137 wrote , noting how all are equal once they hit the court			0
' it â€™s revealing that he would seek out a game like this but even more that others would give it to him : no one watching would have been able to guess which guy was president , ' he added about the fierce competition			0
' @entity9 could find a perfectly respectable game with his equals in which he could shoot and score and star , but this is the game he wants to play			2
