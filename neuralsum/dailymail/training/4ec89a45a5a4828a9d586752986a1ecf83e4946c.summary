by @entity0 published : 19:20 est , 6 january 2014 updated : 03:30 est , 7 january 2014 energy companies are refusing to hand over a £ 50 cut in bills promised to all households by @entity5 and @entity6			1
five weeks ago , the prime minister and the chancellor announced a change to green levies which they claimed would save bill payers £ 50			1
however , only two of the ‘ big six ’ energy companies , @entity16 and @entity17 , have said they will pass on the full reduction to all their customers			1
five weeks ago , the prime minister and the chancellor announced a change to green levies which they claimed would save bill payers £ 50 three companies – @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 – have decided that three million customers on fixed - rate tariffs will get a reduction of just £ 12 , or 23p a week			1
@entity30 , which recently put up its bills by 10.4 per cent to an average of almost £ 1,500 a year , has yet to make an announcement			0
the decisions represent a challenge to the government ’s authority and its ability to deliver on promises to consumers			1
price comparison website @entity41 has set up an e-petition asking ministers to force firms to give the £ 50 cut to all			2
only two of the ¿ big six ¿ energy companies , @entity16 and @entity17 , have said they will pass on the full reduction to all their customers spokesman @entity51 said : ‘ while the @entity37 announcement was an attempt to help struggling households cope with the rising cost of their energy bills , the silence from some suppliers has been deafening			1
‘ @entity16 and @entity17 have done the right thing and said all customers will benefit from the reduced cost of levies , and @entity16 has already introduced its lower prices			1
‘ we ask the government to challenge the other energy providers to play fair and help households by passing on the full reduction to all customers			1
people are fed up with this smoke - and - mirrors mentality from energy firms			0
’ at the beginning of december , @entity6 said : ‘ there ’s going to be an average of £ 50 off people ’s bills			1
‘ we are absolutely insistent that this is going to be brought in			0
’ subsequently , a spokesman for the energy secretary , @entity82 , said : ‘ we have announced a package that should lead to all households seeing an average saving of around £ 50 a year			1
‘ there is no practical bar to these savings being passed on to consumers on fixed tariffs and our expectation is that all consumers will benefit from the £ 50 discount			2
’ @entity24 said yesterday that its variable - tariff customers will receive a 3.3 per cent cut from january 12 however , this has not happened			0
fixed - tariff customers with @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity24 are only getting a reduction of £ 12 , while npower remains silent on the bills issue			0
@entity24 said yesterday that its variable - tariff customers will receive a 3.3 per cent cut from january 12 , bringing the average bill down to £ 1,284			0
it confirmed that around one million fixed - rate customers will only get £ 12 off			0
the @entity102 - owned firm said that most people on fixed rates are already paying less than those with variable tariffs , and so it is not necessary to give them the full £ 50 cut			2
this is at odds with the policy of @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity37 ministers			2
a spokesman for @entity24 said : ‘ at present , 97 per cent of customers on fixed - price products already have a lower bill value than these new standard tariffs			0
‘ these customers were protected from the rising cost of green levies as they were not impacted by our recent price rise			2
’ @entity122 , head of energy at the customer body @entity124 , said : ‘ the message has been that people were going to save £ 50 on their energy bill , but it seems a fair chunk of people will not get that			1
' the right thing to do would be to apply the full reduction across the board			0
that is the expectation that the government has created			0
’ @entity137 , of comparison website @entity139 , said : ‘ the whole intent of the government ’s proposals was to give people much - needed relief			0
i feel very strongly that everyone should benefit			0
