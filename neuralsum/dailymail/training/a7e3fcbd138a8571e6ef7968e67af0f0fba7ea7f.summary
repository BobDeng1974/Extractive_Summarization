@entity0 is now looking into claims made by @entity2 that he met pope @entity3 while in college and was in @entity5 for the historic fall of the @entity7			1
@entity8 was historically the only @entity9 anchor who was present the night the @entity7 fell , but it seems that @entity2 may have claimed he too was there , while working with @entity12			1
' i 've been so fortunate , ' said @entity2 in a 2008 forum at the @entity15 according to @entity16			2
' i was at the @entity17 the night the wall came down			2
' and while @entity2 did witness some of the wall 's removal , an @entity0 source said as a matter of fact ; ' @entity2 arrived the day after the wall came down			1
' however , at a november 8 , 2014 gala he stated ; ' here 's a fact : 25 years ago tonight , @entity8 and i were at the @entity7			1
' as for his meeting with pope @entity3 , while @entity2 did acknowledge the fact the @entity3 vicited @entity36 while he attended , it was n't until 2004 that he suddenly said during a commencement speech at the same university that he met he man , and shook his hand			1
following his death however , @entity2 said ; ' i was a student at @entity36 , and over the course of two hours , chatted up a @entity44 agent who spilled like a cup of coffee and told me that the pope would be coming our way , straight up the steps of a side door at the @entity51			1
i positioned myself and held out my hand and said , " welcome to @entity36 , holy father			0
" and he embraced my hand with both of his , made the sign of the cross , and said a blessing to me			0
' this as claims he was friendly with the seal team responsible for killing @entity59 during his time in @entity61 have been called into question			1
the embattled broadcaster claims he received a soldier 's knife as a gift and was given a piece of the helicopter used in the 2011 operation which led to the former @entity72 leader 's death			0
in interviews he also described flying alongside @entity74 in helicopters a number of times - a tale the @entity9 @entity79 has disputed because they do not embed journalists with counter-terrorism units			2
the veteran journalist was also reporting on the conflict from @entity84 at the time he claimed to have arrived in @entity61 with the elite team			1
the new allegations have surfaced just two days after the 55 - year - old was suspended by the channel for six months without pay after lying about an rpg attack in @entity61			2
shortly after the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks was killed in a secret operation in @entity94 , @entity2 started talking openly about the unit in interviews claiming he had the ' honor ' of flying with them when he first arrived in @entity99			1
the embattled broadcaster is seen reporting from @entity100			0
he claimed he arrived three days after the invasion on march 22 , 2003			0
however he was stationed in @entity84 at the time the @entity102 reported that during an appearance on the @entity105 with @entity106 the day after the @entity59 raid in 2011 , @entity2 said : ' we have some idea which of our special operations teams carried this out			1
it happens to be a team i flew into @entity99 with , on the condition that i would never speak of what i saw on the aircraft , what aircraft we were on , what we were carrying , or who we were after			0
' while anchoring @entity0 's @entity122 the following night he said : ' now , people might be hearing about @entity74			1
i happen to have the great honor of flying into @entity99 with them at the start of the war			0
' a year later on the chat show he claimed he flew in with the military unit on march 22 , 2003 , three days after the invasion			0
however he was in @entity84 for the initial stages of the invasion and did not report from inside @entity61 until april 9 - where he used a flashlight to speak to the camera			2
in another @entity105 appearance in 2012 , @entity2 told a soldier he admired his knife while they chatted over a box of @entity142			1
he then told the host : ' darned if that knife did n't show up at my office a couple weeks later			0
' it is allegedly one of the many memorabilia items @entity2 has been handed over the years - including signed sports memorabilia , autographs and a b - 24 control panel from an @entity154 aircraft that was recovered in a field in @entity156 eight years after he was gifted the weapon he described how he received an un-signed thank you note with a package containing a piece of fuselage			2
he claims it was from the helicopter used in the raid on @entity59 's @entity94 compound			1
the aircraft was blown up by the commandos after the raid , fearing it contained sensitive material that could have got into enemy hands and used against the @entity9			2
in the months after the raid , @entity173 managed to secure a deal with @entity94 that saw some of the tail from the aircraft returned			0
replacement : on wednesday night , @entity2 ' name was taken off the @entity122 ' graphics and the program 's title was officially changed @entity79 spokesman @entity184 told @entity185 could only have received a piece of the helicopter after parts of it had been given back			1
he added : ' we do not embed journalists with this or any other unit that conducts counter-terrorism missions			0
' on tuesday @entity2 was suspended for six months without pay after he admitted to lying about his time in @entity61			1
in a note sent to @entity0 staff , @entity198 , the president of @entity0 's news division , described his puffed - up retellings of events from 2003 as ' wrong and completely inappropriate '			2
bosses at the network finally acted after deciding @entity2 's own decision last week to remove himself from anchoring for ' several days ' was not enough			2
he claimed to have been insidean aircraft when it was hit by an @entity206 - he was actually around one mile away			0
on wednesday , the network changed the name of the broadcast from @entity122 to @entity122			2
acknowledging that it was ' an enormously difficult story ' to report , the show aired a segment about @entity2 ' six - month suspension and pledged to make itself worthy of viewers ' trust			2
replacement anchor @entity216 opened the report by saying : ' and now to the story many of you are talking about tonight and one that for us not only hits close to home but in our home			0
' @entity216 quoted from statements from @entity198 and @entity224 , in which they described @entity2 ' actions as ' wrong and completely inappropriate , ' and which jeopardized ' the trust millions of @entity9 place in @entity230			1
' @entity216 then added : ' now if i may on a personal note say it is an enormously difficult story to report			0
' @entity2 is a member of our family , but so are you , our viewers and we will work every night to be worthy of your trust			1
' @entity238 has contacted @entity0 and the @entity79 for comment			2
scandal : the newest allegations are concerning for @entity2 ( pictured arriving for his appearance on @entity106 's show in 2013 ) who is already facing an investigation by @entity230 @entity246 , @entity247 , 1970s in a 2011 interview , @entity2 recalled his time as a teenage volunteer firefighter during which he saved a puppy			1
however in a 2005 @entity254 interview , @entity2 had claimed to save not one but two puppies			0
in the same @entity254 interview @entity2 also revealed that he had been mugged at gunpoint while selling @entity260 trees in the sleepy @entity247 town in which he grew up			0
a number of locals have questioned the credibility of his claim that someone ' stuck a .38 - caliber in my face '			0
@entity269 , 2003 over the years @entity2 has told multiple versions of a story about being in an army chinook helicopter during the @entity269 in 2003			1
last month he claimed his helicopter was hit by ground fire , an allegation he was later forced to admit was false after an outcry from soldiers who were present			0
@entity2 issued an on - air apology and wrote on @entity279 : ' nobody 's trying to steal anyone 's valor			0
' @entity283 , 2005 @entity2 has told several stories about his experiences reporting from @entity286			1
he has claimed to have seen a dead body float past the window of his hotel in the city 's @entity290 â€“ even though the area was n't flooded			0
the accuracy of other @entity283 claims , including that he caught dysentery drinking the flood waters and that his hotel was ' overrun ' with gangs , have been called into question by others who were on the ground during the disaster			1
@entity303 , 2006 in a 2007 interview with @entity305 , @entity2 recalled ' katyusha rockets passing just underneath the helicopter i was riding in ' during a trip to @entity303			0
in fact he was nowhere near enemy fire and in a broadcast segment filmed that day he described rocket fire ' six miles away '			0
@entity314 , 2006 a @entity74 vet accused @entity2 of lying to skip an event honoring members of the @entity318 so that he could appear on @entity319			0
on the day of the @entity322 event the @entity230 anchor told organizers that a ' pressing engagement ' meant he would n't be able speak at the dinner , but later that evening he appeared in a walk - on role on @entity319 's @entity327 .			1

@entity0 is looking into claims @entity2 made in the past about being at the @entity7 the night it fell and meeting @entity3
@entity2 has seemed to give conflicting accounts , saying that he both was and was not in @entity5 the night the @entity7 fell
it is well known that @entity8 was the only major @entity9 journalist who was present the night the wall fell
the *disgraced* @entity122 anchor has also told conflicting stories about a possible meeting he has with pope @entity3 in college
these reports comes shortly after claims he was friendly with the seal team responsible for killing @entity59 during his time in @entity61 have been called into question
