unique taste : @entity1 at a party with @entity3 ... not drinking his gin he is one of the most feted chefs in @entity6 , with an enviable six @entity8 stars and a reputation for creating exciting and innovative new tastes			0
now @entity1 has launched a typically exotic gin , infused with tea and lemon			0
but despite his track record , and a suitably elevated price tag , the drink has just come bottom of an expert taste test			2
embarrassingly , his @entity19 even scored considerably lower than @entity21 ’s own brand budget spirit , which costs less than half as much			1
@entity1 said of his drink : ‘ the addition of @entity24 with its aromatic bergamot makes this a spirit with real spirit			1
’ expert taster @entity28 acknowledged that @entity1 was ‘ pushing the boundaries ’ with his concoction – but came to the blunt conclusion : ‘ it does not work			1
’ he tested several gins according to four criteria : bottle design , price , the taste neat and with @entity40 tonic water			1
only on design did @entity1 ’s product – part of the @entity43 from @entity45 range for the upmarket supermarket chain – score top marks			0
it was equally poor served neat or with tonic			2
@entity28 gave the £ 23 bottle just 44 points out of 100 , saying : ‘ when drunk neat the gin is aggressive from midway to swallow and the @entity24 blend does not complement the tonic at all well			1
‘ the botanicals make it flavoured but with the bergamont you have the tea taste there			0
it does not work on any front			0
’ in contrast , @entity21 ’s £ 9.99 own brand – @entity67 – managed to secure fourth spot with 85 points			2
it scored 15 out of 25 for taste neat and full marks for taste with tonic and for price			1
top - ranked was the familiar @entity77 brand , among the cheapest at £ 14 for a 70cl bottle			2
the most expensive spirit tested , the £ 32 @entity79 , also scored poorly , coming in eighth out of ten			2
@entity28 , who conducted the survey for his consumer website can i eat it ? added that the mixer was important too , saying : ‘ if you are a @entity87 drinker you are wasting your hard - earned cash buying high priced , super premium , elegantly flavoured gin only to pour pronounced quinine - flavoured tonic water into it			1
’ a @entity45 spokesman said that @entity96 ’s gin was best drunk with @entity98 tonic water			1
she added : ‘ if you do not like @entity24 or bergamont you may not like this gin			0
it ’s really popular with our customers			0
it ’s all quite subjective			0
it ’s a twist on traditional flavour – that ’s the point			0

his @entity24 *&* @entity109 scored lower than @entity21 **'s** own brand spirit
expert taster @entity28 acknowledged he was ' pushing the boundaries '
tested bottle design , price and the taste - neat and with tonic water
but said @entity121 **'s** bergamot - infused concoction ' does not work '
