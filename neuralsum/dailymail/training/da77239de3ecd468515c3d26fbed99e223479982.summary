@entity1 affair has been made even worse by giving in to the mob @entity4 chief executive @entity3 has issued a fresh apology for appearing to compare @entity1 ' attempt to clear his name with the campaign for justice over the @entity11 disaster			1
@entity3 made the comments in a radio interview after it emerged that @entity1 ' proposed move to @entity16 had collapsed amid threats to club staff and their families			1
his remarks provoked outrage among a number of @entity11 families and their supporters			1
an initial apology on @entity26 earlier on friday prompted dr @entity27 , the academic who was the primary author of the @entity29 report , to claim @entity3 had compounded his ' crass and insensitive ' comments			1
video @entity3 's apology for connecting @entity11 and @entity1 @entity1 ' move to @entity16 was called off after threats were made to staff members @entity4 chief executive related @entity1 ' attempt to clear his name to the battle for justice that followed @entity11 it is with great sadness that today i have withdrawn from talks with @entity16			1
i would like to thank the club , and those who have supported me in my lawful quest to find work			0
i apologise to the club 's supporters , sponsors and all those effected by the last 72 hours			0
sadly the ' mob rule ' tactics employed by the more radical elements of our society and the constant media reporting has had the desired influence on some sponsors and the club would face significant financial pressure if i joined them			0
the most significant issue for me was that owing to the threat of funding opportunities being withdrawn which may jeopardise the building of @entity16 's new stand it would mean that workers would lose their jobs and others would be put at risk - that would simply not be fair			1
upon legal advice , i chose not to discuss the events in question			0
my silence has been misinterpreted as arrogance and i would like to state that this could not be further from the truth			0
i do remain limited at present by what i can say due to the ongoing application to the @entity80 and whilst i continue to maintain my innocence , i wish to make it clear that i wholeheartedly apologise for the effect that that night in @entity84 has had on many people , especially the woman concerned			1
finally , it has been claimed that those using social media in an abusive and vindictive way towards this woman are supporters of mine			2
i wish to make it clear that these people are not my supporters and i condemn their actions entirely and will continue to do so			2
@entity3 has now issued another apology accepting it had been a mistake to link the two issues and issued a statement on the @entity4 's website			2
he said : ' i would like to apologise unreservedly for linking the @entity11 case with the situation involving @entity1			1
' the last thing i intended to do was to upset anybody connected to the @entity11 tragedy , i can only apologise			2
' @entity3 said he had ' long been a supporter ' of the @entity11 families , adding : ' i know the people involved and i will be very happy to ring them and let them know that			1
' the point i was making was not to embarrass or upset anybody at all among the @entity113 supporters			0
i 'm very much an admirer of them and they know that			0
' @entity1 , pictured with girlfriend @entity117 , has n't secured a return to football with the @entity16 @entity1 was linked with old club @entity120 and @entity121 , and wo n't move to @entity122 @entity16 @entity27 had reacted to @entity3 's initial apology by telling @entity124 : ' in his telephone interview this morning on @entity26 , @entity3 apologised for any offence he may have caused to the @entity11 families			1
' he then proceeded to compound yesterday 's crass , insensitive and wholly inappropriate comments by stating that , ' @entity1 is a totally different case but he has the same belief of his innocence			2
'' @entity1 , now 26 , was jailed in april 2012 for raping a 19 - year - old woman			1
he maintains the sex in a @entity84 hotel was consensual and protests his innocence			0
he was released from prison in october , after serving half of a five - year sentence			1
@entity3 mentioned @entity1 ' situation alongside events that followed the @entity11 tragedy , which resulted in the deaths of 96 @entity113 supporters at the 1989 @entity142 semi-final against @entity143 in @entity144			1
after years of fighting by the families of those who died , new inquests into the deaths began last year and are continuing in @entity150			2
speaking about @entity1 ' case on thursday , @entity3 had told @entity152 : ' he would not be the first person or persons to have been found guilty and maintained their innocence and then been proved right			1
' if we are talking about things in football , we know what happened , what was alleged to have happened at @entity11			2
and it 's now unravelling and we are finding it was very different to how it was portrayed at the time - indeed by the police at the time			2
' @entity165 , chairman of @entity166 , said @entity3 's comments were offensive but he should n't resign			1
she said : ' i accept his apology and i think it 's ridiculous for everybody to ask for his resignation			0
he phrased his wording wrong			0
' there is no comparison and i did find it offensive because you can not compare what we went through with @entity1			2
' i do n't think he meant it , i think he did n't put his brain into gear			0
' he 's apologised now and i think we should leave it at that			0
' @entity186 , whose 18 - year - old son @entity187 died at @entity11 , told the @entity188 : ' my feeling is that it was a gaffe on @entity3 's part and it 's not the first time @entity3 , in his position at the @entity4 , has made a gaffe			1
' he is a man who , in my opinion , seriously needs to think before he opens his mouth			0
' it 's an absolute disgrace that he should compare @entity11 to @entity1			1
' @entity16 chief executive @entity197 , reads out a statement in relation to @entity1 on thursday @entity201 chairman @entity200 says there is no basis for the governing body to intervene it has been widely reported that @entity16 will not be signing @entity1 , which we can now confirm			1
the whole issue has divided opinion and the club has been put under unbearable pressure as a result			0
@entity212 could have placed significant financial pressure on the club and continued to be a divisive influence			0
as a consequence the deal could not go ahead			0
as a club we condemn all crime including rape and irrespective of any appeal procedure it was always the case that we were prepared to withstand the barrage of abuse that is evident within the country and on social media			0
we deplore and condemn the vile and abusive threats , some including death threats , which have been made to our fans , sponsors and staff whilst this process has been in the public domain			1
finally , we would like to place our gratitude to all who have supported the club during this difficult period , including the club staff , who have acted with professionalism at all times			0
we understand @entity243 has released his own statement on his website			0
the club will not be making any further statement on this matter .			0
