i 've always been supportive of referees			1
of course you call the errors , but generally speaking i like to think i have an appreciation of the difficulty of the job referees do and that is reflected in my assessment of their performance			1
i do feel managers use referees as a way of deflecting blame away from themselves and their players and that a lot of players and bosses need to look in the mirror before looking at the referee			1
but this season , officials are making it more and more difficult for those of us who defend them from inevitable criticism			1
some of the errors made have been astonishingly bad , and have left me wondering two things : do they actually know the laws of the game ? and secondly , are they actually watching the game properly ? @entity33 went unpunished for this clear handball despite referee @entity35 having a clear view @entity38 's @entity37 protested to referee @entity35 , who waved his appeals away immediately despite @entity37 's impassioned appeals to the official , @entity38 were not awarded the penalty at @entity44 ' i 'm not a fan of managers focusing on referees but i have a lot of sympathy with @entity51 boss @entity50 when he said this ahead of their monday night game with @entity55 : ' they ( @entity56 ) accept there 's been an honest error made but there have been too many now			1
' referees are part of the game and the error of the referee makes the game what it is			1
it 's tough to take when you 've got six or seven big calls which did n't go your way and scorelines could have changed			1
' i still believe @entity50 needs to address his own shortcomings before he tries to think he knows what 's best for match officials , but he has a point nonetheless			1
@entity51 have had some shocking decisions go against them this season – notably at @entity79 in the @entity81 defeat last month			1
@entity51 manager @entity50 has had his fair share of decisions going against @entity84 so this weekend i decided to study four games at random to see how bad the situation was			2
in each game , there were decisions that were n't just questionable , they were downright terrible : 1			1
the inexplicable offside decision which robbed @entity92 and @entity93 of a goal against @entity95			2
it was high drama right at the end , so the fans were also robbed of a brilliant moment			2
if you 've seen the incident you 'll know how bad it is			2
the linesman remembered one important rule about needing two opponents between the ' attacker ' and the goal , but he forgot the even more basic law that you ca n't be offside in your own half			0
the referee @entity110 was in the vicinity as well , but failed to overrule a ridiculous decision			0
this is a linesman and a referee either not knowing the laws of the game , or forgetting them during the 90 minutes			1
either way , it 's poor from both			0
replays clearly showed @entity92 was inside his own half as he ran clear to score a disallowed goal the @entity124 's celebrations were cut short when assistant @entity125 inexplicably flagged for offside @entity126 defender @entity92 could n't believe his bad luck but @entity93 still went on to win the match 2			0
@entity33 's handball in the late stages of @entity132 's victory at @entity38			0
referee @entity35 had a clear view from a good position , so what was he watching ? how could he possibly interpret that handball as anything other than a penalty ? 3			1
@entity35 's brother @entity139 also took up a good position on a set - piece as @entity142 threatened @entity143			0
but despite staring straight at @entity143 's @entity144 grabbing hold of @entity142 's @entity146 and hauling him to the floor , @entity35 decided not to award a penalty			2
what was he watching ? @entity33 went unpunished for this clear handball despite referee @entity35 having a clear view @entity38 's @entity37 protested to referee @entity35 , who waves his appeals away despite @entity37 's impassioned appeals to the official , @entity38 were not awarded the penalty 4			1
@entity158 awarded handball against @entity161 's @entity160 earlier this season at @entity163 when the ball clearly hit the defender 's face , so the official has found himself demoted to the championship where the nightmare continues ( in fairness , he was faultless when reffing the @entity172 tie between @entity173 and @entity174 earlier this month )			2
@entity160 was penalised even though the ball clearly hit his face as @entity177 attacked for @entity178 on saturday , @entity158 was at the @entity179 to control @entity181 's 1 - 1 draw with @entity182			0
@entity181 's @entity183 charged towards @entity182 ' @entity184 , lunged in late after the ball had gone and took the defender off his feet			0
it was a horrible challenge , potential leg - breaker and understandably the @entity182 players were livid			0
@entity158 decided it was only worthy of a yellow card			0
the linesman was maybe more to blame – he was right on top of the incident			0
it 's a clear red card , so why did n't @entity158 give it ? to make matters worse , @entity183 headed @entity181 's equaliser later in the game			2
@entity181 's @entity183 ( pictured ) charged towards @entity182 's @entity184 but went unpunished so why are these glaring errors happening more and more ? honest mistakes are fine , but these are the kind of blunders which if translated and applied to other jobs would get people sacked or killed			0
a lorry driver does n't look properly as he approaches a roundabout – it 's potentially fatal			2
if i do n't know broadcasting law , i might say something i 'm not allowed to and i get sacked from @entity212			0
so why are so many officials failing to do their jobs properly ? these are n't dishonest mistakes of course , but they fall way below the standard that should be set in a professional industry			1
my theory is this : goal - line technology has come in and been a success ( expensive of course and it is n't used anywhere near as often as its advocates led us to believe it would be , but it 's been a positive )			0
the arrival of technology has changed the mindset of officials			2
i think subconsciously some referees and linesmen have ' downed tools ' and stopped doing their jobs properly , stopped concentrating , stopped watching the game closely			1
why ? because they want more technology to come in so they can wash their hands of any responsibility			0
they know they 'll still get paid as professional refs , but they also know there will be less pressure on them as individuals because they 'll be able to refer incidents to a ' video ref. ' back to basics please			0
ref it right , or ref off			0
@entity251 reacts after @entity252 blows his whistle to award a penalty to @entity255 at the @entity256 @entity251 was not happy with the decision by referee @entity252 at the @entity256 as it gave @entity255 a vital lead			1

@entity81 referees have been getting big decisions *wrong* lately
do they know the laws of the game ? are they watching properly ?
@entity252 awarded @entity255 a *controversial* penalty against @entity79 but questions have been asked as to whether he was even looking
referees can often be used as a *scapegoat* by managers but the officials are doing themselves no *favours*
