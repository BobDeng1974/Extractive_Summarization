plans for a third runway at @entity2 have finally been scrapped after @entity3 joined the @entity4 in ruling out an expansion at the airport			1
the controversial plans , which attracted widespread criticism from environmentalists , are now ' off the agenda ' , despite a third runway being backed by the previous @entity3 government			0
activists had opposed plans for an expansion at @entity2 on the grounds of disturbance and pollution from aircraft			1
overcrowded : although @entity2 is said to be running at 98 per cent capacity , a ban has been put in place on expansion of its runways the @entity26 , @entity27 , explained to @entity28 that the reason for @entity3 's u-turn on the proposed runway was due to the local environmental impact			1
she said : ' the answer for the south - east is not going to be to fall back on the third runway at @entity2 ... it is off the agenda			2
' transport secretary @entity37 confirmed the decision but denied it meant ministers are ' anti-aviation '			1
and although expansion of @entity2 was ruled out , @entity37 would not reject outright @entity44 's ambitious plans to build an airport in the @entity46 near @entity47			1
speaking at an aviation conference in @entity50 , ms @entity37 admitted the third runway plan ' had its share of critics ' , adding : ' the political reality is that the ( @entity2 ) runway decision has been made and it is done			2
off the agenda : shadow transport secretary @entity27 , left , ruled out building a new runway at @entity2 , while new transport secretary @entity37 , right , confirmed there would be no third runway ' i want to emphasise that the decision we took does not mean we are anti-aviation			1
' this transport secretary and this government are anything but			1
' i know just how many people rely on an efficient , effective and successful @entity2 - for work and for travel			2
i get just how crucial aviation is to our national wellbeing - economically , socially and environmentally			0
with @entity2 and @entity74 both full to capacity , ministers are keen to find a solution to ease the strain on @entity79 's two busiest airports			1
' @entity81 ' airport rail link : @entity2 and @entity74 airports could be linked by a high - speed rail network to create the world 's first ' virtual hub ' airport under proposals considered last month			1
dubbed ' @entity81 ' , the scheme would see a £ 5billion high - speed rail service linking the west @entity50 site to west @entity91 in 15 minutes			0
travelling at speeds of 180mph , trains would leave every five minutes and would follow the route of the @entity96			0
' @entity97 ' : @entity50 mayor @entity44 ’s revealed plans three years ago for a @entity50 airport built on artificial islands in the tidal waters of the @entity102			1
the ' @entity97 ' transport hub would see a £ 40billion airport built off the @entity105 in @entity47			1
' and i recognise that the industry needs certainty and decision making in the long - term national interest , not chopping and changing for reasons of short - term political advantage			0
' she added : ' it 's time to turn the page and write a new chapter in the story of aviation			0
prominent in that new chapter will be a credible , workable aviation strategy			0
' @entity37 used the speech to airport operators to also reaffirm the government 's block of new runways at @entity127 and @entity74			2
however , when asked if she ruled out a new airport hub in the south - east altogether , she said : ' no. there are a number of airports in the south - east ; we have people like the mayor who has proposals for new airports			2
' according to the @entity28 , ms @entity37 refused to rule out the mayor of @entity50 's ' @entity97 ' airport plans , adding : ' there are a number of different proposals that we have to look at ... i have no doubt he will want to raise that with me			1
' it emerged earlier this year that @entity79 's busiest airports like @entity2 are running at 98 per cent capacity			1
@entity151 where the proposed third runway would be built fly away : activists on top of a @entity156 plane at @entity2 as part of a climate change protest celebrity backing : actor and impressionist @entity160 was one of many to back the demonstration against the third runway overcrowded skies above the @entity79 led to planes spending a cumulative 55 hours a day circling @entity2 waiting to land			2
fuel worth £ 119,000 alone is wasted above @entity50 every day as planes ' stack ' delaying an average of 55,800 passengers for between four and 20 minutes			0
@entity173 , managing director of @entity175 air traffic control , said in june that @entity50 was ' on a knife edge ' because of the lack of runways across the city that means planes are stacked as a matter of course			0
ms @entity37 added : ' sometimes it 's easy to fall into the trap of thinking that strategy is all about dealing with single issues , such as capacity for example			0
' i believe our aviation strategy for our country has to be far broader - based than just the capacity question , though i recognise the importance of that question			0
actually , the best strategies cover all the bases			0
' they 're focused on the short term and the long term , the economic and the environmental , the local and the global , the needs of the sector and the needs of the passenger			0
' ms @entity37 said she recognised that some at the conference were in favour of a third runway at @entity2			2
she told them that the best solutions emerged ' when all sides are fully engaged and properly involved ' .			0
