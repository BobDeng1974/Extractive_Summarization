@entity0 , who joined @entity2 ’s management stable to fulfil his dream of fame and riches in @entity6 , has decided to take control of his own management affairs			1
@entity0 turned to @entity2 ’s @entity10 group after splitting from his father @entity11 after the 2009 season , but @entity13 has learned that his contract with the company recently expired			1
although neither side would comment on the development , an industry insider said : ‘ @entity0 is concentrating on the world championship for now and will assess how to progress with his management around @entity21			1
championship leader @entity0 maintained his focus despite a hydraulic problem on friday ‘ he has been muttering for a year or so about changing his relationship with @entity2			1
he wants to stand on his own two feet — and cut down on commission fees			0
’ paddock sources say @entity0 , who is ranked among the world ’s most marketable sportsmen with a £ 68million fortune , is unlikely to seek a professional reunion with his father , despite @entity11 ’s recent attendance at races in @entity34 and @entity35			1
the pair appear to have mended their sometimes fractious relationship , but @entity0 is known to prefer their current father - son bond to a management - client association			1
members of @entity2 ’s staff are continuing to help @entity0 with his public relations for now			1
but @entity2 , the media mogul who managed the @entity43 and @entity44 , will not be involved in negotiating the driver ’s next contract			1
@entity2 ’s greatest coup was sealing @entity0 ’s current @entity49 contract			1
it brought his man about £ 30m - a - year and a winning car			2
@entity0 was just three thousandths faster than @entity54 in friday 's two practice sessions however , that deal was struck with @entity57 and @entity58 — both of whom have left the team — as well as @entity62 , the non-executive chairman			1
relations between @entity0 ’s side and @entity49 are not as harmonious since @entity65 took over from @entity66			1
with @entity0 ’s contract due to expire next year , a hard and potentially messy negotiation awaits him and his new advisers			1
a number of paddock veterans , including the late @entity73 ’s manager @entity72 , would be keen to enlist @entity0 , but he is likely to eschew @entity75 specialists to seek advisers who are more used to the celebrity side			2
@entity0 , 29 , has a love for @entity79 and especially the music industry			2
his girlfriend is @entity6 pop star @entity82 , he is friendly with several rap stars and has talked about starting his own record label			0
@entity0 drives out of his garage during the second practice session at the @entity87 he spends much of his time in @entity89 with @entity82 , and once told @entity13 : ‘ it ’s really cool over here			1
i love @entity89 and i can see myself maybe living there one day			0
’ @entity2 was mostly notable by his absence from @entity75 , allowing @entity93 , the former @entity94 executive , to act as @entity0 ’s regular aide and travelling companion , but he has not been at @entity0 ’s side for some time			1
@entity0 came to @entity98 this weekend via @entity99 , where he appeared — albeit for less than a minute — on @entity102 ’s high - rating today show			1
having got to the @entity87 , he opened with the fastest time in morning practice , a small step towards recording his fifth consecutive win and extending his 17 - point lead over @entity49 team - mate @entity54			1
can @entity0 keep his momentum through the final three races of the season ? @entity0 opened with the fastest time in morning practice on friday ‘ i do n’t see why not , ’ he said			1
‘ but @entity54 ’s going to be strong this weekend			2
he ’s going to be pushing			2
the tables could always turn			0
@entity54 has shown this year that every race he bounces back			0
and i would do the same			0
' we should have a great car this weekend			0
i ’ve been strong here in the past			0
the last few races i ’ve really felt great			0
when i was trailing to @entity54 , it was almost like there was a wall and i was trying to climb it but could n’t quite get over it			0
but i ’ve got over it now			0
’ victory here would make @entity0 the most successful @entity128 driver in terms of races won ( sir @entity131 won three championships and 27 races at a higher average )			1
he stands on 31 wins , level with @entity136			0
of that piece of beckoning history , @entity0 said : ‘ it ’s an incredible feeling			2
i never thought that i would be put on a record board with the greats			0
to be among the great drivers in the @entity128 is a really proud feeling			2
@entity0 may have to handle difficult negotiations with @entity49 over a new contract next year agent @entity2 ( right ) has worked with @entity44 , @entity146 and the @entity43 ‘ but i do n’t really think about it as much , because i just want to win the championship			1
perhaps at the end of the year i will be able to look back and really think about it			0
but i want to win the world championship			0
that ’s the most important thing			0
’ @entity0 ’s hope is that the double points on offer at the last race in @entity157 will not tilt the title away from him			2
but @entity54 , asked if he would be uneasy winning in this way , said : ‘ not really , no. it is just the way it is in sport unfortunately			0
‘ it does n’t really matter , although of course it is a bit artificial			0
’ he added with a smile : ‘ being behind , i love the double points			0
it has been the best idea of the season ! ’ the non-appearance of @entity172 and @entity173 , who are in administration , means today ’s qualifying session will be revamped			0
four cars will be eliminated in the first two sessions to leave the usual 10 in the shoot - out for pole , the prime position for which @entity0 is favourite .			2

@entity49 driver @entity0 has parted with agent @entity2
ranked among the world ’s most marketable sportsmen with a £ 68m fortune
@entity0 wants to manage his own affairs and reunion with father is unlikely
he opened with fastest opening practice time at the @entity87
victory in @entity98 would make @entity0 the most successful @entity128 driver
