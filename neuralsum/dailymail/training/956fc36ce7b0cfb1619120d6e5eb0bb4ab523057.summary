@entity0 has the perfect retreat should he ever doubt his own achievements			1
it is a place in his home : a personal mini-museum , spread over two floors			2
by any standard his career has been fruitful and today he will receive a new centrepiece for his exhibition : a @entity11 set in a glass case to mark his 100 appearances for @entity14			1
at 29 , he is the youngest footballer to reach the landmark			2
@entity16 for @entity0 : @entity17 is a highlight but i want to win a @entity19 @entity0 , pictured in training on friday , will win his 100th @entity14 cap against @entity22 on saturday @entity0 admits that he almost quit football at 14 but changed his mind after talking with @entity26 's @entity25 @entity27 ( right ) and @entity28 ( centre ) join @entity0 in a race during training at @entity32 apart from the embroidered @entity14 crest , @entity0 's golden cap is entirely hand - made by @entity35			1
based in @entity37 , the company is the world 's oldest fraternal regalia maker and has been in operation for more than three centuries			2
the company is also responsible for the ribbons that adorn the @entity43			2
click here to watch it being made ' i 'll put it in there , with the other things i 've collected over the years , ' said @entity0			1
' the first things you see when you go in are my @entity55 medals			2
' it 's something i 'm very proud of			2
they 're on a mannequin in a @entity60 shirt			1
there 's a glass cabinet underneath with all my @entity14 caps in			1
' here is a rare glimpse into @entity66			2
' it 's probably about the size of this room , split between upstairs and downstairs , ' he adds , glancing around a large conference room inside @entity32 , where he is being mined for memories before becoming @entity14 's ninth centurion			1
and there is still time for him to surpass the 125 caps of @entity78 and the 49 goals of sir @entity80 , who will make saturday 's presentation			1
he stands just six goals behind @entity84 and there is no sign of him stopping			2
@entity0 wants to play at a fourth @entity19 , in @entity88 in 2018 , and yet he might have quit football at the age of 14 , had it not been for @entity26 coach @entity25			1
the @entity60 striker trains at @entity32 with his @entity14 team - mates on friday @entity0 will receive this special gold cap from @entity14 legend sir @entity80 at @entity95 on saturday the @entity60 man shows off a shirt showing the number of @entity14 caps he 'll have by saturday the high - @entity17 ' it was such a great experience for me to go there at such a young age and start all the games and score four goals			1
' the low - red card v @entity106 ( @entity107 2006 ) ' i believe to this day if i 'd stayed on we would 've won the game			1
unfortunately we did n't go through and that made it worse for me			2
you start thinking , is it my fault ? ' top three goals ' my first goal against @entity116 ( september 6 , 2003 ) , although the keeper should have saved it			2
i do n't know what he was doing ! the goal against @entity121 ( june 21 , 2004 ) when i played a one - two with @entity122			2
i really enjoyed that goal			2
and the header against @entity125 ( june 17 , 2004 ) in the @entity17 finals			1
it means a lot more to score for your country in competitive games			2
' @entity133 0 - 0 in @entity134 and x-rated verdict on @entity14 fans via a tv camera ' no matter what people might say , we as a group of players care about playing for @entity14			1
when things are n't going right on the pitch , it 's frustrating because we know we can do better			2
sometimes it boils over , and that 's what happened			0
it 's certainly something i regret			0
' funniest moment ' one of the masseurs put a lot of work into a game of ' @entity157 ' for us in @entity159 , and drew @entity160 to play			0
at the first offer he took the deal and completely ruined the game			0
' best @entity14 boss ' certainly my best time has been under @entity167			1
my goalscoring is the best it 's been for @entity14			1
he really trusted his players and gave us freedom			0
it was difficult under @entity175 as the team were n't doing well			0
under @entity178 it was quite tough in a different way			0
he tried to bring something different to what we normally had			0
' @entity184 out of 10 ' i ca n't say it is three or eight			0
you have to really look at how successful you have been and we have n't been successful			0
that 's how teams and players get rated			0
i 'd say it has n't always been great but it 's always been magical to play for my country			0
' ' i stopped enjoying it , ' said @entity0			1
' it was really down to @entity25 that i carried on			0
' he sat me down and made me fall back in love with it			0
' he just said he had n't seen any player with the talent i had and that i 'd be making a mistake			0
' i thought , " he used to be @entity26 manager , so he knows the game "			0
that 's when i stopped going to boxing and focused solely on football			2
it was the right decision			0
' three years later came an @entity14 debut , starting the second half in a side captained by @entity210 after @entity211 made 11 half - time substitutions in a friendly against @entity214			1
@entity0 was up front with @entity26 pal @entity215 , cheered on by friends and family of the @entity219 pair who put on a special coach to @entity221			1
@entity215 scored and never played for @entity14 again			1
@entity0 knows his life could have turned out very differently			1
he might have ended up in landscaping or building like his mates			0
as it is , he will lead out @entity14 at @entity95 with sons @entity225 and @entity227 , before today 's @entity229 qualifier against @entity22			1
' i hope this is n't my last tournament , ' @entity0 said			1
' it 's difficult when you 're coming up to 30 to start planning the next four years			0
' you have to be realistic			0
there 's a chance i might not go to the next @entity19 but it 's something i 'd love to do			0
i never want to cut my career short by deciding not to play for @entity14			1
' tournaments have not been kind to @entity0			1
his fondest @entity14 memories are from @entity17 , even though it ended prematurely with a broken metatarsal			1
his favourite goals are a decade in the past			0
it is indicative of the era			0
@entity245 reached back to the 5 - 1 win in @entity247 , his sixth cap			1
@entity249 , like @entity0 , cherished @entity17			1
for those representing @entity14 over the past 10 years , it has been about regrets and missed opportunities			1
amid untimely injuries , red cards and red mists , one moment stands out : his dismissal against @entity106 in the 2006 @entity19 quarter - final			2
' that 's the low , ' said @entity0			1
' i believe to this day if i 'd stayed on we would 've won the game			0
' i beat myself up about it straight away			0
i was in the dressing room watching the rest of the game			0
it was difficult , knowing no matter what happened my tournament was over			2
' we did n't go through and that made it worse			0
you start thinking , ' is it my fault ? ' we 've been stuck , we ca n't get past the quarter - finals and that was a great opportunity , like @entity17 was			0
' not going through , and knowing my red card might have affected that , was difficult to take			0
i did n't show it too much			0
i tend to keep things like that inside			0
' the @entity60 narrative took over			1
@entity0 's red card was for stamping on @entity285 , but a wink from @entity287 came to signify a @entity289 plot to wind up @entity14 's best player until he blew			1
@entity0 appears to stamp on his @entity60 team - mate @entity287 at the 2006 @entity19 @entity0 looks shocked after being sent off in @entity14 's quarter final defeat to @entity106 in @entity247 ' i spoke to him ( @entity287 ) straight after the game , ' said @entity0 , ' because i knew which way the press would go in terms of us falling out			1
we had to make sure that did n't happen for @entity60 's sake			1
' there was never an issue			0
i understood why he 'd done it			0
he was trying to win for @entity106 and to be honest i 'd probably do the same for @entity14			1
i remember saying to the referee that he was diving , trying to get him a yellow card			0
' it happens in football			2
' @entity0 has revealed that he 'd like to follow @entity167 ( right ) into management when he retires @entity167 insists the best is still to come for his captain of the next generation â€” and @entity0 agrees things are moving in the right direction , but 99 @entity14 caps breed caution			1
given the choice , he would have preferred a @entity19 medal to a ' @entity11 '			0
would n't they all ? on saturday , he can savour his experiences and his goals and be thankful he did n't pack it all in 15 years ago			2
' i 'm blessed with the career i 've been able to have , ' said @entity0			1
' there have been tough times on and off the field , but i 've never thought this is n't what i want to be doing			0
i 've always believed this is the perfect thing for me			0

@entity0 knows why @entity287 did what he did in 2006
@entity0 will win his 100th cap against @entity22 at @entity95 on saturday
before his 100th cap @entity0 admits he would do the same for @entity14
but he is yet to win a tournament with the @entity14 after debuting at 17
@entity60 ace says he almost quit football to become a boxer
the @entity60 man is determined to end his career with a *trophy*
