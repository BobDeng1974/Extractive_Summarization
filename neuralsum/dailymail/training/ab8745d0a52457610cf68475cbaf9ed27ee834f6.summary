at the end of september @entity23 's announced a 5p cut across its 294 forecourts			1
@entity26 , @entity27 , said : fuel is a big part of the weekly budget for many households , which is why we 're taking the lead and cutting the price of unleaded petrol and diesel by up to 5 pence per litre			0
' @entity37 and @entity38 followed suit with big cuts , with @entity38 fuel director @entity41 declaring : ' as @entity44 's biggest fuel retailer this means more motorists can make real savings			2
' the moves by the big name supermarkets came as they faced renewed pressure from budget retailers like @entity51 and @entity52			0
the latest drops have been triggered by @entity23 's cutting prices by 5p , leading other retailers to follow suit independent petrol stations have also moved to cut prices to compete with the supermarkets , who traditionally have been cheapest for drivers			1

the main reason for the drop in prices is the global supply and demand			0
' to put it crudely we are swimming in oil			0
@entity89 oil output has doubled in the last six years and is running at its highest production levels for a quarter of a century			0
however , global demand has declined particularly as the @entity93 economies cool down			0
' in the @entity44 the reductions we are seeing at the pumps have also been speeded up by competing supermarket offers of discounts of up to 5p litre			0
' drivers have n't seen such prices since 2011 but oil prices are still volatile and more global unrest in oil producing countries can just as easily send the price spiralling again			1
enjoy it while we can			0
' petrol retailers had been accused of failing to pass on savings from a dramatic fall in oil prices to motorists			2
fears over the spluttering global economy has caused oil prices to fall by more than 16 per cent since early june from $ 109.13 ( £ 67.98 ) to $ 91.48 ( £ 56.99 ) a barrel			0
this is enabling retailers , including supermarket giants @entity38 and @entity23 as well as @entity117 and @entity118 , to make bigger profits on @entity44 ’s forecourts as they can buy fuel on the wholesale markets more cheaply while cutting prices more gradually for customers			1
@entity125 , @entity126 's shadow transport secretary , said : ' motorists struggling with the cost of living crisis have been hit hard by the government hiking vat on petrol and by retailers who are sluggish at passing on falls in global oil prices			2
' lower petrol prices are good news but the government needs to do more to ensure that oil companies are passing on price fall savings in full			2

the last time pump prices were so low was in january 2011

@entity73 says pressures on oil market mean prices will rise again this winter
