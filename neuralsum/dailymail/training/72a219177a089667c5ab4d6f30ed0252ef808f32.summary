it is so rare , @entity42 doctors have only seen 30 cases in the last 150 years			1
he has been on the brink of death several times and once even had to be resuscitated by his own mother			1
but now , in spite of doctor 's dire predictions , miss @entity15 can finally give her son his first cuddles			1
miss @entity15 and her partner @entity54 , 32 , were overjoyed when they found out they were expecting twins in september last year , 12 months to the day after suffering a heartbreaking miscarriage			1
but problems became apparent 12 weeks into the pregnancy and the couple discovered that one of the twins had sadly died			0
the pair feared that the tragedy of september 2010 would be repeated two-fold			0

proud : @entity23 is held by his father @entity70 during his extended hospital stay clinging to life : jacob inside a @entity75 incubator at 16 weeks , miss @entity15 's amniotic fluid began to leak , prompting doctors ' concerns that his lungs would not grow without it			1

but on february 29 , @entity23 was born weighing just 2lb 10oz and breathing on his own			2
miss @entity15 said : ' when we discovered @entity23 was still clinging on in the womb , it was like my miscarried son had sent me a little part of himself back from heaven to say " there 's a bit of me living on with you "			1
' but then with the amniotic fluid , it was just a waiting game , every minute , every second			0
' i was a ticking timebomb waiting to go off			0
my life was on a knife edge			0
' doctors said they would not help him breathe if he failed to take his first breath			2
it was such a difficult time			0
' but then he did and i was elated , amazed and thrilled			0
it was like my little , wonderful boy had stuck two fingers up to the doctors who had not believed in him			2
' worrying time : miss @entity15 is overjoyed to have finally taken @entity23 home fighter : despite just 17lb , half of what he should weigh for his age , @entity23 has finally come home @entity23 was transferred to @entity127 where he received treatment on an enlarged liver and physiotherapy on a squashed foot			1
however , terror struck when @entity23 was just 11 days old after he stopped breathing and his lips turned blue in his mum 's arms following sedation for a blood transfusion			2
fortunately , @entity139 reacted immediately and administered cpr to her newborn			0
she said : ' it was the most difficult moment to deal with throughout the last year			0
' i gave him the kiss of life			0
it was an immediate reaction			0
my little boy needed help and i had air in my lungs and just gave it to him			0
' i knew what i had to do and i did it			0
him turning blue in my arms was horrendous			0
' a few weeks after he was born , doctors were stunned when scans revealed @entity23 was suffering from the extremely rare condition @entity164			1
the condition , which is normally benign , causes multiple orange coloured lesions to appear on the skin and without treatment can cause glaucoma and blindness			0
however , in @entity23 's case the lesions were also growing inside his body , attacking his blood , bones , lungs and liver and causing jaundice			2
@entity23 would need five key operations and two dialysis sessions to survive			0
he underwent a lung biopsy , a lymph node biopsy , laser eye surgery , the insertion of a @entity185 line to administer drugs and two operations to correct hernias			0
doctors also discovered @entity23 suffers from retinopathy caused by his prematurity , the same eye condition as @entity193			2
for months , @entity23 's nappy changes and feeds were interspersed with pediatric care , blood and platelet transfusions and countless checks and scans			2
but in that time he has amazed doctors with his incredible progress and , still weighing just 17lb , half of what he should weigh for his age , @entity23 has finally come home			2
miss @entity15 said : ' having him home is like winning the lottery but 10 times better			1
