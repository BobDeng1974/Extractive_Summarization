thank goodness it ’s friday ? not if your name is @entity3			1
it all went wrong for the @entity5 at the masters in the second round and here was another friday horror show over the front nine at the @entity10			2
after 12 holes on thursday the 25 - year - old was five under par and lying joint second			2
after seven holes of his second round he was four over and tied 119th			1
you ’d write it off as one of those things except it happens all too often with @entity3 when the shoulders slump and one calamity is duly followed by another			1
it ’s certainly something he needs to start addressing			0
rough : it all went wrong for @entity3 during the second round at @entity30 at least the real @entity3 showed up over the back nine			1
he gave himself a good talking - to during the long walk from the ninth green to the 10th tee			0
three birdies meant he came to the 18th needing one more to make the halfway cut on the limit			0
when he really needs to make a putt he does so , and he did so again here , with a 20 - footer			0
but it still means he will start on saturday morning 12 shots off the lead held by @entity44 @entity43 , who added a 69 to his stunning opening score of 63			1
’ i do n’t know what ’s happening on fridays , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ it ’s like i do n’t want to play on that day			0
but i ’m proud of the way i battled back			0
it ’s not where i want to be but at least i am around for the weekend			0
’ a good analogy would be with the football team who are 4 - 0 down at half - time and ‘ win ’ the second half 2 - 0			0
@entity3 knows better than anyone you simply ca n’t play zombie golf for five holes at this level and hope to win trophies			1
when @entity43 finished his work at lunchtime it appeared for all the world he would lead by a street			1
step forward young @entity66 @entity65 , who hunted him down so artfully in the more difficult afternoon conditions he will start the third round just one shot adrift			2
@entity65 , who went so close to winning the masters on his debut , is also playing in this tournament for the first time and is the only player in the field who has not had a bogey			2
the 20 - year - old is an amazing talent , is n’t he ? precarious : @entity3 chips on the 17th green during the second round of the @entity10 @entity81 shot 71 that was the least he deserved for some quality play and will start the weekend six behind in tied fourth place , as will @entity86 champion @entity85 and @entity87 , who also broke par by a stroke			1
@entity89 is one shot further back			0
@entity43 has fallen to 61st in the world and has n’t won a full field event since holing the winning putt at the @entity94 at @entity95			2
here he has returned to form in spectacular style , with 14 birdies in 36 holes			0
a true measure of his performance is the next best total from his half of the draw was posted by @entity66 veteran @entity105 , who is six behind , with @entity66 - based londoner @entity106 a further shot adrift			0
tidy : @entity43 hits from a sand trap on the 14th fairway during the second round at @entity30 in contention : @entity81 chips onto the 14th green during the second round and is in the top six it ’s not as if @entity43 ’s half was full of journeymen either			1
all four of the players in with the chance to become world no 1 were in action alongside @entity43 and all four looked pedestrian by comparison			2
best placed is @entity124 , who needs to finish in the top six and is presently tied 24th			2
@entity127 @entity126 did at least show the pride of a world no 1 hopeful to bounce back from his calamitous opening round of 77 with a score of 67 that left him on the same mark as @entity3			1
he then revealed his status as one of the sporting world ’s most eligible bachelors was at an end , since he got married in secret in the week after the masters			0
@entity142 ’s @entity141 shot 69 and @entity144 @entity143 a 67 to stand on three under , while the most high profile player to miss the halfway cut was open champion @entity147 , who missed out by one			0
colourful : a @entity150 fan watches the play during the second round of the @entity10 animal magic : @entity43 rests on his bag as he waits to hit his tee shot on the fifth hole			1

@entity3 went from joint second to tied 119th after playing ' zombie golf '
@entity43 added a 69 to his stunning opening round of 63
@entity81 is tied fourth after a second round 71
