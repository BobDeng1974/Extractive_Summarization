planets wandering through space , unattached to any star or solar system , may be much more common that previously thought , according to an expert			1
the planets are hard to find because , without orbiting a star , they reflect very little light			1
but 50 have now been found in the past 15 years , leading some to suggest they may be abundant in the universe			1
@entity10 for @entity11 has explained that solo planets ( artist 's impression shown ) could be common			1
this is thanks to more regions of dust and gas than we thought			1
planets become ' rogue ' when they are ejected or form on their own and about 50 have been found in the last 15 years the potential for these free - floating planets to be common was discussed in an article by @entity10 for @entity11			1
rogue planets , or interstellar planets , are planetary objects that were either formed by themselves or were ejected from a system			1
a brown dwarf is commonly regarded as the ‘ missing link ’ between stars and planets			0
they are too large to be classed as true planets , but too small to have ignited nuclear fusion at their cores and be classed as stars			0
when a celestial body first forms , its size will determine what sort of object it becomes			0
as a star forms from a cloud of gas , its core becomes so large that hydrogen fuses into helium			2
conversely , a planet forms into a smaller sphere that is not large enough to have nuclear fusion at its core			0
brown dwarfs fall somewhere in between			0
they are the size between a gas giant like @entity59 and a small star			2
their mass , meanwhile , can be anything from 15 to 75 times the mass of @entity59			0
this is not enough to sustain fusion but , owing to their size , this has led astronomers to coin brown dwarfs ‘ failed stars ’			0
as they do n't emit much light it ’s thought there may be many rogue brown dwarfs drifting through the galaxy waiting to be discovered			1
how abundant they are in the universe , though , has been the cause of some debate			0
but ms @entity10 explained so - called globulettes - regions of dust and gas that can form planets - could make them more common than thought			1
the number of possible planets in one such region is not known , and this depends on what the boundary between cloud density and planet formation is			0
‘ @entity99 are very numerous , ’ dr @entity97 from the @entity98 told @entity11			2
‘ even if only a small fraction can be made to collapse , they could make a significant contribution to the population of free - floating planets			0
’ rogue planets are of particular interest to astronomers because they represent objects that have likely failed to form into a star			1
@entity110 dwarfs , for example , are substellar objects that are not massive enough to sustain fusion , but are still more than 13 times the mass of @entity59			0
the exact boundary between a giant planet and a low - mass brown dwarf is still being debated , but finding more rogue planets could shed light on this mystery			2
and this could indicate that there are more rogue planets than we know of in the cosmos			2
@entity10 explained that so - called globulettes - regions of dust and gas that can form planets - could make them more common than first thought			1
however , the number of possible planets that can be found in one such region is not known			2
shown is a star - forming region known as @entity137 's @entity136			0

@entity10 for @entity11 explained solo planets could be common
this is thanks to more regions of dust and gas than we thought
planets become ' rogue ' when they are ejected or form on their own
about 50 have been found in the last 15 years
but as they do n't orbit a star they reflect little light and are hard to find
