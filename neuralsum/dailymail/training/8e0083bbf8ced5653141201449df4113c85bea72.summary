soon anything from clothing to cars could be used to harness energy from the sun. scientists from @entity8 have developed low - cost , spray - on solar cells that can be applied to surfaces in a similar way to paint			1
the cells are made of a material called perovskite , which is cheap to produce and , when used as a spray , produces very little waste			1
scientists from @entity8 have developed low - cost , spray - on solar cells that can be applied to small surfaces ( pictured ) in a similar way to paint			1
the cells are made of a material called perovskite , which is cheap to produce and , when used as a spray , produces very little waste this , along with the fact the spray can be easily mass produced , means manufacturing costs are low , which ultimately means prices would be lower for customers			1
in theory , the spray could be used on any surface that the cells can stick to , however , its efficiency is likely to be affected on flexible surfaces , or fabrics			2
around 85 per cent of photovoltaics currently used are made from crystalline silicon			0
it is expensive to produce and typically has a conversion rate of 25 per cent , on average			0
the material used in the spray - on cells is perovskite			1
@entity45 is a term used to describe the mineral crystal structure found in the calcium titanium oxide mineral species , made of calcium titanate			0
it was first used for solar cells in 2009 , but efficiency was poor			2
@entity54 researchers then used polymers to make solid cells , which were eventually engineered to efficiencies of 16 per cent			0
efficient organometal halide perovskite - based photovoltaics were demonstrated in 2012			0
the @entity8 team found that by spray - painting the perovskite they could make prototype solar cells with efficiency of up to 11 per cent			1

the team of scientists from the @entity8 is the first to make perovskite solar cells using this spray painting technique			1
experts from the @entity8 ’s @entity80 and @entity81 previously used the method to produce solar cells using organic semiconductors - but using perovskite is considered a major step forward			1
efficient organometal halide perovskite - based photovoltaics were first demonstrated in 2012			0
they are now a promising new material for solar cells because they combine high efficiency with low materials costs			1
around 85 per cent of photovoltaics currently used are made from crystalline silicon ( stock image pictured )			0
it is expensive to produce and typically has a conversion rate of around 25 per cent			0
the material used in @entity8 's spray - on cells is called perovskite @entity45 is a term used to describe the mineral crystal structure found in the calcium titanium oxide mineral species , made of calcium titanate			1
the team of @entity8 scientists is the first to make perovskite solar cells using this spray - painting process			1
spray nozzle and head pictured lead researcher professor @entity111 said : ‘ there is a lot of excitement around perovskite - based photovoltaics			2
‘ remarkably , this class of material offers the potential to combine the high performance of mature solar cell technologies with the low embedded energy costs of production of organic photovoltaics			2
’ while most solar cells are manufactured using energy intensive materials , perovskites , by comparison , require much less energy to make			2
by spray - painting the perovskite layer in the air , the team hope the overall energy used to make a solar cell can be reduced further			1
professor @entity111 added : ‘ the best certified efficiencies from organic solar cells are around 10 per cent			2
the @entity8 team found that by spray painting the perovskite , ( illustration pictured ) they could make prototype solar cells with efficiency of up to 11 per cent			1
perovskite cells , in general , have efficiencies of up to approximately 19 per cent ‘ @entity45 cells now have efficiencies of up to 19 per cent			0
this is not so far behind that of silicon at 25 per cent - the material that dominates the worldwide solar market			0
’ he added : ‘ the perovskite devices we have created still use similar structures to organic cells			0
what we have done is replace the key light absorbing layer - the organic layer - with a spray - painted perovskite			2
‘ using a perovskite absorber instead of an organic absorber gives a significant boost in terms of efficiency			0
’ the @entity8 team found that by spray - painting the perovskite they could make prototype solar cells with efficiency of up to 11 per cent			1
professor @entity111 said : ‘ this study is a significant step towards efficient , low - cost solar cell devices made using high volume roll - to - roll processing methods			1
‘ i believe that new thin - film photovoltaic technologies are going to have an important role to play in driving the uptake of solar - energy , and that perovskite based cells are emerging as likely thin - film candidates			2

scientists from @entity8 have developed low - cost , spray - on solar cells
they are applied to surfaces in a similar way to paint or *graphic* *printing*
the spray - on cells are made perovskite that produces very little waste
they can be easily mass produced , meaning manufacturing costs are low
