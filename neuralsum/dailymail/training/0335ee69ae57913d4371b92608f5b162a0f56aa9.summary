by @entity0 published : 11:57 est , 23 december 2012 updated : 12:03 est , 23 december 2012 no sooner have predictions of one @entity4 apocalypse passed by without incident , another has surfaced to keep the doomsday faithful believing			1
just two days after the much - anticipated @entity8 failed to materialise , one historian has re-ignited the debate by claiming that @entity10 could come tomorrow instead			2
many apocalypse believers were left red - faced when the december 21 date they so publicly announced as the end went without a hitch			1
but @entity14 , a leading expert in @entity16 advanced civilisations from the @entity17 , believes interpretations of the @entity4 calendar may actually be off by a few days			1
more of this on christmas eve ? men dressed in ' martian ' outfits pictured on december 21 in the village of @entity25 , @entity26 , where some thought an alien spacecraft would emerge to save them from the @entity4 apocalypse that never materialised optimistic : @entity30 host celebrations marking the end of the @entity4 age at the @entity35 archaeological site on december 21			1
an historian believes the end could actually come on christmas eve instead the original calculations were based on the @entity39 , which pin - pointed the end of the 13th baktun on december			1
a baktun is equivalent to around 144,000 days or 394 years			0
but mr @entity14 says matching up our own present - day calendar with that of the @entity46 is not an exact science and a deviation of a few days to @entity49 is plausible			2
he also casts further doubt on there even being a @entity4 prediction of an apocalypse at all			2
he said several @entity4 texts have been deciphered which mention days well beyond this @entity49			2
mr @entity14 told @entity55 : ' you find dates in @entity4 texts that are thousands or millions of years into the future			0
' all over again : @entity14 , an historian from the @entity17 , says calculations based on the @entity39 ( above ) that predicted december 21 as the apocalypse may have been off by a few days cult following : crowds also gathered in @entity64 , @entity65 , in anticipation of the so - called @entity67 on december 21 for centuries , the ending of the @entity4 calendar , which supposedly occurred on december 21 , has been taken as a sign of an impending @entity10			1
but there were a few sheepish looks in a corner of south - east @entity26 , which was cited as the only safe spot			0
@entity25 , in the foothills of the @entity77 , is said to contain a mystical @entity79 garage which will ferry people off planet earth as the @entity82 runs out			0
doomsday followers were convinced here will be no december 22 for anyone except for those who make it to the hamlet , which has a population of 189 people			0
it had swelled to around three times that amount today , with some 200 journalists joining mainly ' @entity95 types '			0
and one gambler was left red - faced after putting a £ 10 bet on the apocalypse , standing to win £ 50,000 if the world had ended			1
may come in useful : @entity100 ( right ) talks with staff members @entity103 ( left ) and @entity104 about a bunker they are constructing for a client at @entity107 to save him from an apocalypse , whenever it may happen @entity109 , a 26 - year - old , from @entity110 , made the bizarre bet at odds of 5,000 - 1 after hearing of the @entity67 that the world would be destroyed , or changed , at 11.11am ( gmt ) on december 21			1
scientists in @entity115 also had their tongues firmly in cheek , setting up a two - story replica of a @entity4 pyramid and planting an electronic countdown timer on top , drawing crowds at the @entity123			0
' this is not the end of the world			0
this is the beginning of the new world , ' @entity126 , an @entity127 seer , said at a gathering of hundreds of spiritualists at a convention centre in @entity135 's @entity134 city of @entity136 , an hour and a half from the @entity4 ruins at @entity139			0
the @entity140 , who invented an amazingly accurate calendar almost 2,000 years ago , measured time in 394 - year periods known as baktuns			0
some anthropologists believe the 13th baktun ends on december 21			2
still , archaeologists have uncovered @entity4 glyphs that refer to dates far , far in the future , long beyond december 21 .			1

expert says calculations based on @entity4 calendar may be off by a few days
many thought *ancient* civilisation predicted apocalypse on december 21
but they were left red - faced when end of the world failed to materialise
