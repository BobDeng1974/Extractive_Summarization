by @entity0 a seemingly fit and healthy 28 - year - old died from bowel cancer after doctors repeatedly told her she was suffering from a harmless digestive complaint			1
nursery worker @entity5 visited her doctor several times over an 18 month period , yet doctors did did not recognise her symptoms - which included bloating and abdominal cramps - and mistook the beginnings of bowel cancer for irritable bowel syndrome ( @entity13 )			1
the cancer eventually spread to her lungs , bones and liver and she died in february this year			1
to this day , there is no clear reason why she succumbed to the @entity20 was fit and healthy and there was no family history of the disease			2
because @entity25 had been diagnosed with @entity13 , she was prescribed medicine to ease her stomach cramps and laxatives to relieve her constipation			1
while they were very effective in improving her quality of life , they were also masking the symptoms of a far more deadly problem			1
bowel cancer is traditionally associated with old age , with nearly 75 per cent of cases affecting those aged over 65			1
but over the past decade , the number of cases in those aged under 30 has shot up by an alarming 120 per cent			1
experts do not fully understand why this is happening , but it is thought changing diets , with increased fatty and high - calorie meals , are fuelling the rise , although many sufferers , such as @entity25 , have lived a healthy lifestyle			1
@entity25 started noticing a change in her digestion in august 2011 , then aged 26			1
she started to suffer mild bouts of abdominal pain and constipation			2
‘ the doctor diagnosed her with @entity13 and at that point , apart from being a bit uncomfortable , it was n’t really causing any day - to - day problems , ’ says @entity29			1
‘ it was n’t until the beginning of 2012 that the symptoms worsened			2
' as time went on , @entity25 developed frequent trapped wind , constipation and occasionally loose motions			1
' but there was no bleeding at all so cancer did n’t cross her or the doctor ’s mind			2
’ close : @entity25 and mother @entity29 enjoying a glass of wine in summer 2010 , a year before she started showing symptoms of her disease just weeks after this picture with her boyfriend @entity90 was taken in @entity91 , @entity25 was hospitalised the bouts of discomfort were also sporadic , which made the symptoms fit perfectly with her @entity13 diagnosis			1
in the first few months of 2012 , @entity25 visited her doctor repeatedly after she began to @entity97 was sent for a raft of blood and urine tests , yet results came back entirely normal			1
towards the end of march the pain and episodes of vomiting became more frequent , but @entity25 had booked a holiday in @entity91 with her boyfriend @entity90 and she was keen to enjoy her herself			1
‘ she thought the stress of planning the holiday had made the @entity13 worse , ’ remembers @entity29			1
‘ her dog had also been diagnosed with cancer which caused more stress			2
’ bowel cancer affects 40,000 @entity114 and kills 16,000 each year			1
it usually starts in the large bowel but can rarely begin in the small bowel			2
symptoms usually include abdominal pain , blood in the stool , unexplained constipation or diarrhoea and unexplained weight loss			2
it is the third most common cancer in the @entity114 , but is the second most common in women			2
around 72 per cent of cases occur in those aged over 65 but numbers of young people developing the disease are rising rapidly			1
age , a low - fibre diet , being overweight , high alcohol intake , smoking and a family history of the disease puts you at an increased risk			0
the disease is usually treated with a combination of surgery , chemotherapy and radiotherapy			0
early detection and treatment usually results in a cure but late diagnosis only has a five year survival rate of 6 per cent			0
on her return , @entity25 ’s condition continued to deteriorate and in the week before she was hospitalised at @entity153 , on the @entity154 , she visited her gp four times			2
doctors prescribed her more laxatives and suppositories but by then , she was vomiting almost continually in spite of taking anti-nausea tablets			0
a further set of blood tests continued to tell her consultants that she was otherwise well , with no cancer antibodies			0
eventually she was referred for an ultrasound , but by the time the appointment arrived in april 2012 , she had already been admitted to hospital			0
at @entity153 , on the @entity154 , she was promptly x-rayed and given pain relief			0
the x-ray showed that there was an abnormality , but doctors could not ascertain what was wrong			0
‘ the doctors thought she may have another inflammatory bowel condition called @entity176 and she was given antibiotics , ’ says @entity29			0
‘ even up until this point she suffered with none of the classic symptoms of bowel cancer such as bloody stools and diarrhoea			1
’ doctors then performed a colonoscopy which showed a tumour in her colon			0
she was immediately operated on and surgeons removed half her colon , surrounding lymph nodes and fitted a colostomy bag			0
@entity25 underwent eight cycles of chemotherapy but her oncologist was n't confident that the treatment would be successful			2
unaware : despite @entity25 's declining health , she looked welll even as late as last summer ‘ throughout this period @entity25 always tried hard to look her best and she found ways to dress that hid the bag , ’ says @entity29			1
‘ she was always very positive			0
’ in september a ct scan showed that there was no remaining cancer			0
‘ she was looking forward to getting back to work and getting back to normality , ’ adds @entity29			0
but tragically , after another scan in january this year , lesions were found in her lungs			0
@entity25 , pictured shortly before she died , with dog @entity27 she was sent for another scan which revealed that the cancer had spread to her lungs , liver , to her reproductive organs and her bones			1
on february 14 @entity25 was admitted to hospital and given antibiotics and oxygen in a bid to relieve a chest infection she had developed			1
she was also given a session of palliative chemotherapy			0
the antibiotics did not work and she was moved to a hospice five days later			0
‘ she died on the following morning very peacefully in her sleep , ’ says @entity29			0
‘ i was able to stay with her all night and for that i will be eternally gratefully to the hospice			0
' @entity25 did not want to be on her own			2
in the end her chest infection developed into pneumonia and she was so weak that she could n’t fight it			0
’ @entity29 is stoical about @entity25 ’s illness , saying that she could not have received ' better treatment : ‘ they tried their best to cure her			2
we had good support from the specialist nurses and both of her consultants			0
’ but she is keen to raise awareness about bowel cancer in the younger generation because , she says , attitudes need to change : ‘ the number of cases in young people are rising and it is very easy to misdiagnose the disease			1
@entity248 @entity114 is campaigning for more widespread screening and faster diagnoses for younger sufferers			0
even after her diagnosis and surgery , @entity25 , pictured here in may 2012 , was keen to get on with life as normal in the first research into the experiences of younger bowel cancer patients , their ‘ @entity258 ’ report alarmingly reveals that just under half of women and ten per cent of men saw their gp more than five times before being referred to a specialist , or being diagnosed as an emergency			1
in some cases , twice as many women as men had to wait over a year before being diagnosed			0
some younger people are at higher risk of bowel cancer because of a strong family history , a genetic condition such as @entity278 syndrome or because they have an inflammatory bowel condition such as @entity176 's disease			1
however , many of these people are not receiving the screening they need to detect changes that could lead to bowel cancer , say the charity			1
' if you have suffered with digestive problems for six weeks or more i urge you to visit your doctor			0
do n’t think it wo n’t be you because figures have shown that regardless of age , you are at risk , ' says @entity29			0
@entity29 and the rest of her family – her daughter @entity297 , 31 , and husband @entity296 , 63 – were given colonoscopies after @entity25 ’s death and it was found that there was no genetic cause behind her cancer			1
there is no history of the disease in her family			0
' i 'd like to think @entity25 could still be helping others , ' adds @entity29 , finally			2
' it 's what she spent most of her life doing			2
