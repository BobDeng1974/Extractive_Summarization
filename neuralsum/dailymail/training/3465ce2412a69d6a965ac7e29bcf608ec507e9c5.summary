it comes after a seven - stone @entity19 pitbull belonging to one of their neighbours bit a postman because the child holding his lead was not strong enough to restrain the animal , police said			1
@entity27 : a family collect of @entity29 , the seven - stone @entity19 pitbull who bit a postman on @entity10 , @entity13 , leading @entity34 bosses to suspend all deliveries to the street until further notice @entity10 locals have branded @entity34 's decision to stop deliveries ' disgusting ' and ' ridiculous ' , while the dog 's owner said it was ' out of order ' to punish the entire street			1
after the incident last thursday , residents were ironically informed by letter that deliveries to their street had been suspended with immediate effect			1
@entity34 officials told them they could collect their mail from @entity53 in @entity54 , about two miles away , and that any post not picked up after 18 days would be returned to sender			1
they gave no indication of when deliveries would begin again , although the letter did apologise to all affected customers and said staff want to resolve the issue as soon as possible			2
cut off : residents of of the 60 homers on @entity10 , a cul - de - sac in @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 , have been told they must now collect their post from the local delivery office service suspended : @entity10 locals have branded @entity34 's decision to stop deliveries ' disgusting ' and ' ridiculous ' , while the dog 's owner said it was ' out of order ' to punish the entire street @entity71 , 28 , the owner of the dog , which is called @entity29 , said animal now faces being neutered - but police and the @entity75 say he is not dangerous			1
' he 's safe ' : @entity29 's owner @entity71 , 28 , says her dog now faces being neutered - but police and the @entity75 insist that he is not dangerous ' he 's never bitten before and everyone round here knows that he is safe , ' she said			1
' i have a nine - year - old little boy and a five - year - old little girl and @entity29 is brilliant with them both			2
he follows them round and is a great family pet			0
' on the day of the incident my son had put him on a lead and taken him outside			0
i never let him do this because i know @entity29 is too strong for him			0
' i was looking after my friend 's baby that day and so had just nipped upstairs to get her and in that split second , my little boy disobeyed me by taking the dog outside to show off to his mates			2
' i heard my son scream and i looked outside			0
the postman had seen a dog run towards him , got scared and tried to fend him off			1
' @entity29 had jumped up at him and bit the postman on the arm			1
the bite had drawn blood			0
' the police and the @entity75 have been round and they 've said they are happy that he is not a dangerous breed and just advised we get him neutered to calm him down a bit			1
he 's booked in for that today			0
' i think that it 's out of order for @entity34 to decided to punish the whole street for this			1
' if they said that they would n't deliver my post anymore then i 'd understand but it 's just not fair on everyone else			0
' irony : @entity34 informed the @entity10 's 60 households that they would no longer get their letters delivered - with this letter @entity34 spokesman @entity124 said ' suspending deliveries is always a last resort but we take the health and safety of our employees very seriously and we are seeking assurances from the dog owners that their pet will be kept securely while we undertake deliveries			1
' we apologise to all affected customers and would like to assure them that we will be working with the dog owners to resolve the situation as quickly as possible			2
' in the meantime , affected customers can collect their mail from @entity53 on the production of photo id			0
' a spokesman from @entity144 said : ' the dog was on a lead at the time but the lead was held by a child , who was not strong enough to hold on to the animal			1
' the postman suffered a wound to his arm and was taken to hospital to be checked over			2
' the matter was passed on to the neighbourhood policing team who visited the dog 's owner on a joint visit with @entity75 who gave the owner a voucher to have the dog neutered and take it to dog training classes			1
' the dog was not a banned breed or classed as a dangerous dog			1
' housebound : @entity29 sits next to the window in his owner 's home resident @entity173 said he had been waiting for a letter from @entity177 oncology unit after being referred by his gp because he was showing signs of cancer			0
the 69 - year - old said : ' an appointment letter was left undelivered at the sorting office for days			0
' there 's only a short period of time to treat disorders like this and i know that there 's a lot of people that live on this road that do have illnesses or disabilities			0
' ' i 'm disabled but i 'm lucky that i have a car			0
a lot of my neighbours do n't or are unable to drive			0
' another resident said : ' why ca n't they just stop delivering to the house that has the dog ? ' my wife is suffering from a terminal illness and she could be missing information about appointments , visits or even test results			0
' she 's not going to be able to go into town every day to collect the post			0
' @entity13 mp , @entity212 said : ' this is obviously aggravating to the residents but postmen and women face real danger everyday and until they can be sure the area is safe i support them taking this action			0
' i 'm hoping to meet with residents and @entity34 to see how this issue can be resolved			2
