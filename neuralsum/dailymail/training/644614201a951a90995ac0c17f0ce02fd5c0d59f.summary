wisdom , the world ’s oldest known wild bird , is preparing to be a mother again after laying an egg at the ripe age of 63			1
the laysan albatross also had an egg hatch in february , meaning the latest arrival will be her 36th chick , according to estimates			1
wisdom laid the egg at a nesting site at the @entity14 in the @entity15 , about 1,200 miles ( 1,930 km ) northwest of @entity16 , @entity17			1
wisdom the @entity5 laid the egg at a nesting site 1,200 miles ( 1,930km ) northwest of @entity17			1
experts estimate that this was her 36th egg in three decades			1
however , while the species is monogamous , it 's not known for certain she has kept the same partner all these years			1
wisdom is pictured with her latest egg @entity31 albatrosses are monogamous , meaning they mate for life with just one partner , making it all the more remarkable that she has consistently been laying eggs over the past three decades			1
she is said to have had the same partner throughout her life , although experts ca n't know for certain without running tests on the offspring			1
‘ we are thrilled with the public 's interest in @entity28			2
' she really captures people ’s imagination around the world , particularly kids ' , and has become a great ambassador for conservation and @entity14 , ' said deputy refuge manager @entity52			0
five trillion pieces of plastic litter are floating in the world ’s oceans , which is killing countless animals a year , including albatross chicks			0
it is thought that 269,000 tons of plastic are clogging up the oceans - weighing the equivalent of two large cruise liners			2
scientists reported finding billions of plastic shopping bags , bottles , toys , action figures , toothbrushes , fishing gear and even toilet seats floating in the waves			2
plastic pollution kills huge numbers of seabirds , marine mammals and other creatures , while discarded fishing nets trap dolphins , sea turtles and manta rays			0
fragments also lodge in the throats and digestive tracts of animals , attracted by the bright colours of the plastics and mistake them for fish			0
one horrific picture of an albatross chick , dead on a beach in the @entity15 , reveals the scale of the global problem			0
wisdom was officially tagged by scientists in 1956 when she was an estimated five years old , and has since recorded more than three million miles ( 4.8 million km ) flying around the coast of @entity17 and beyond			1
experts at the @entity100 claim wisdom is the oldest bird they know of in the organisation ’s 90 - year history and has consistently laid eggs over the past three decades			1
‘ as the world ’s oldest known bird in the wild , @entity28 is an iconic symbol of inspiration and hope for all seabird species , ' said fellow refuge manager @entity113			2
‘ she provides to the world valuable information about the longevity of these beautiful creatures			0
‘ in the case of @entity28 , she has logged literally millions of miles over the @entity15 in her lifetime to find enough fish eggs and squid to feed herself and multiple chicks , allowing us the opportunity to measure the health of our oceans which sustain albatross as well as ourselves			0
’ @entity31 albatrosses breed on the @entity130 of @entity131 , at @entity132 , and on @entity133 , at @entity134			0
the typical lifespan of a @entity31 albatross is 12 to 40 years according to wildlife officials			0
their feeding grounds are off the west coast of @entity141 , including the @entity142 , and they spend their first three to five years constantly flying , never touching land			2
scientists believe they even sleep while flying over the ocean			2
wisdom laid the egg at a nesting site at the @entity14 ( shown ) in the @entity15 , about 1,200 miles ( 1,930 km ) northwest of @entity16 , @entity17 wisdom is a 63 - year - old @entity31 albatross believed to be the oldest wild bird in the world			1
here she is pictured with a chick between her legs back in february , which also hatched at the @entity14 near @entity17 albatrosses lay only one egg a year , but it takes much of that year to incubate and raise the chick			1
after several consecutive years in which they have successfully raised and fledged a chick , the parents may take the occasional year off from parenting			0
the 590 - acre @entity14 , a small @entity165 territory that lies nestled in the @entity15 between @entity16 and @entity166 , is home to 70 per cent of the @entity168 ’s laysan albatross population			0
wisdom has led a long life and even has a children ’s book named after her , which documents how she survived the @entity174 which put her nest in the path of danger .			0

wisdom the @entity5 laid the egg at a nesting site 1,200 miles northwest of @entity17
experts estimate that this was her 36th egg in three decades
while the species is monogamous , it 's not known for certain she has kept the same partner all these years - although they claim it is more than likely
wisdom was officially tagged by scientists in 1956 when she was five
she has since recorded more than 3 million miles flying around @entity17
