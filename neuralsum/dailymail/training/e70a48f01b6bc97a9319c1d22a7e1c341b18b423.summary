by @entity0 at 25 , @entity1 seemed to have it all , with a lucrative job as a hedge fund trader , exotic holidays and plenty of trips to extravagant restaurants			1
but then the maths graduate decided it was time to stir things up			0
inspired by her mother ’s recipes and memories of her idyllic rural childhood , she swapped the fast - paced world of boardrooms and mega-bucks deals for a simple market stall selling chutneys and preserves made from leftover fruit and vegetables donated by the food industry			1
@entity1 gave up her lucrative job in the city to start eco-friendly business rubies in the @entity28			1
she now makes 1,000 jars of £ 5 chutney , which is stocked in @entity31 and @entity32 , per week miss @entity1 , now 28 , sells her chutneys - which are all made from fruit and vegetables that have been thrown away by restaurants and supermarkets - on a stall in @entity40 's @entity39 three years on , the gamble has paid off after she won the ‘ @entity44 ’ of the business world for her eco-friendly company – which now has an annual turnover of £ 100,000 and supplies @entity31 and @entity32			1
yesterday , a thrilled miss @entity1 put her success down to a love of chutney she inherited from her mother @entity49 – who helped to get her business off the ground by giving her much - needed advice on recipes			2
‘ my mum was on the other end of the phone talking me through things at the very beginning , ’ she said			0
‘ i made some pretty vile batches – it was a matter of trial and error			0
’ the maths graduate , pictured winning the @entity65 prize at the @entity66 , tributes her success to her mother 's recipes recalling her childhood in rural @entity71 and @entity72 , @entity73 , she said : ‘ our water came from a well , our fruit and vegetables from our garden and we had a wind turbine installed			2
’ but after graduating from @entity81 with a master ’s in maths and economics , miss @entity1 ended up working in a very different environment – a hedge fund in @entity40			1
she never forgot her passion for all things natural , however			0
so , to the surprise of her family , she decided to ditch her lucrative career to ‘ pick through the rubbish bins ’ of the food industry			0
after collecting the surplus fruit and vegetables from markets or local farmers , she began boiling batches at home and selling them at a stall in @entity40 ’s @entity39			1
miss @entity1 , now 28 , said : ‘ i went from being able to do exactly what i wanted – going on lovely holidays , having extravagant meals out – to living on a shoestring			2
i ’ve only been able to start paying myself a wage three months ago , so it ’s been a long wait			0
but i was n’t passionate about finance and if i ’d stayed in it for the money i ’d have been really upset with myself			0
’ the entrepreneur , whose father is a beef farmer and whose mother is a ceramic artist , now produces 1,000 jars of chutney a week and hopes to exceed last year ’s £ 100,000 turnover			1
her preserves come in six flavours , including apple and ginger , and cost less than £ 5 per jar			2
last night she was awarded the @entity122 for her innovative company , rubies in the @entity28			1
‘ i ’m absolutely thrilled , ’ she said			0
‘ when i had a change of heart and told [ my family ] “ i want to make jam from leftover produce ” there were a few surprised faces , but they understood the ethos behind my idea			0
but the most important thing they taught me was about believing in myself and not to be afraid of failure			0
’ the businesswoman , pictured on her @entity40 stall , says her passion for all things natural comes from her rural upbringing in @entity71 , @entity73 , where the family 's water came from a well and fruit and vegetables from their garden			1
