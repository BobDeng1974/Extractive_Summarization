by @entity1 reporter @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 are among the hundreds of authors who have added their names to an online letter criticizing @entity9 for restricting access to works published by @entity12			1
the letter , initiated by @entity12 author @entity14 , urged @entity9 to resolve its standoff with @entity12 over e-book prices and other issues			1
readers were asked to email @entity9 ceo @entity19 at jeff@amazon.com and ' tell him what you think			1
' @entity2 ( pictured in 2013 ) is among the hundreds of authors who have added their names to an online letter criticizing @entity9 for restricting access to work should @entity9 have the right to restrict access to specific authors ? @entity9 has slowed delivery on books by @entity32 and other @entity12 authors , limited discounts and removed pre-order tags for upcoming releases			1
other authors endorsing the letter , which appears on this statement to readers , include @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43			1
the letter reads : ' @entity9 is involved in a commercial dispute with the book publisher @entity12 , which owns @entity47 , @entity48 and other familiar imprints			1
' these sorts of disputes happen all the time between companies and they are usually resolved in a corporate back room			0
' but in this case , @entity9 has done something unusual			0
it has directly targeted @entity12 's authors in an effort to force their publisher to agree to its terms			1
' [ full letter reads below ] some on the list are @entity12 writers , but many are published by rival companies			1
@entity12 's exhibition at @entity66 , the annual industry convention in @entity68 , pictured in may this year a letter to our readers : @entity9 is involved in a commercial dispute with the book publisher @entity12 , whichowns @entity47 , @entity48 , and other familiar imprints			1
these sorts of disputes happen all the time between companies and they are usually resolved in acorporate back room			0
but in this case , @entity9 has done something unusual			0
it has directly targeted @entity12 ’s authors in an effort to force their publisher to agree to its terms			2
for the past month , @entity9 has been : as writers — some but not all published by @entity12 — we feel strongly that no bookseller should block the sale of books or otherwise prevent or discourage customers from ordering or receiving the books they want			1
it is not right for @entity9 to single out a group of authors , who are not involved in the dispute , for selective retaliation			2
moreover , by inconveniencing and misleading its own customers with unfair pricing and delayed delivery , @entity9 is contradicting its own written promise to be ' @entity100 's most customercentric company			2
' many of us supported @entity9 from when it was a struggling start - up			0
our books started @entity9 on the road to selling everything and becoming one of the world ’s largest corporations			2
we have made @entity9 many millions of dollars and over the years have contributed so much , free of charge , to the company by way of cooperation , joint promotions , reviews and blogs			0
this is no way to treat a business partner			0
nor is it the right way to treat your friends			0
without taking sides on the contractual dispute @entity122 and @entity9 , we encourage @entity9 in the strongest possible terms to stopharming the livelihood of the authors on whom it has built its business			2
none of us , neither readers nor authors , benefit when books are taken hostage			2
( we ’re not alone in our plea : the opinion pages of both the @entity135 and the @entity136 , which rarely agree on anything , have roundly condemned @entity9 ’s corporate behavior			0
) we call on @entity9 to resolve its dispute with @entity12 without hurting authors and without blocking or otherwise delaying the sale of books to its customers			1
we respectfully ask you , our loyal readers , to email @entity19 , ceo and founder of @entity9 , at @entity147 , and tell him what you think			1
he says he genuinely welcomes hearing from his customers and claims to read all emails from this account			0
we hope that , writers and readers together , we will be able to change his mind			0
if you are a writer and you would like to add your name to this list , please email @entity14 at @entity159			0
sincerely , @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity4 , @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity179 , @entity180 , sir @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity184 , @entity185 , @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 , @entity189 , @entity190 , @entity191 , @entity192 , @entity193 , @entity194 , @entity195 , @entity196 , @entity197 , @entity198 , @entity199 , @entity200 , @entity201 , @entity202 , @entity41 , @entity203 , @entity14 , @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity206 , @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity210 , @entity42 , @entity211 , @entity212 , @entity213 , @entity214 , @entity215 , @entity216 , @entity43 , @entity217 , @entity218 , @entity219 , @entity220 , @entity221 , @entity222 , @entity223 , a.k.a. @entity224 , @entity226			0
