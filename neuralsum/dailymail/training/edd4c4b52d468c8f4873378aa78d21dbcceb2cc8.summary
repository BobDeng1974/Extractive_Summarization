this must surely be the ultimate tea break accessory for those with a sweet tooth - a ' dipper ' mug designed to perfectly accommodate and dunk a biscuit			0
@entity5 , a 3d printing enthusiast , designed the @entity7 to solve the problem of biscuits being too big to be fully submerged			1
originally marketed in @entity11 for kids who want to dunk biscuits in a small amount of milk before bed , they could also become a hit with tea lovers in @entity18			0
the @entity7 mug has been designed to perfectly accommodate and dunk a bisuit each cup holds 100ml of fluid and is 8.5 cm long - perfect for a @entity28 's chocolate digestive - and features flared sides to allow the thumb and forefinger to be accommodated			1
mr @entity5 , an associate professor of @entity29 at the @entity30 in @entity31 , said : ' my kids love to dip their cookies in milk but the choice of cup poses a problem			2
' a cup large enough for whole - biscuit dipping must be filled with a huge amount of milk , whereas a cup that holds the right amount of milk is usually too narrow for proper dipping			0
' the sides of the cup are flared to allow thumb and forefinger to achieve dipping perfection , and the drink can be drunk afterwards from one of the narrow ends			2
' after designing the cup it was created in ceramic by @entity58 service @entity56 , which is now selling the pale blue mug for $ 36.82 usd ( Â£ 22 )			1
each cup holds 100ml of fluid and is 8.5 cm long - perfect for a @entity28 's chocolate digestive last month , @entity63 reported how new research suggested the humble @entity66 biscuit was the most robust biscuit for dunking			1
of the five common biscuits studied , @entity66 came out on top , with the @entity70 exposed as the least resilient dunker , becoming unstable after as few as three short dunks ( approximately four seconds )			0
this is because it is an oat - based , rather than wheat - based biscuit and the larger oat particles in the @entity70 provide less structural strength .			0
