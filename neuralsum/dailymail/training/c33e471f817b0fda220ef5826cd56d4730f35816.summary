‘ @entity10 promised never to put us through that again			1
’ true to her word @entity10 went on a diet and lost nine and a half stone going from a size 30 to a size 12 weighing 12 stone 7lbs			1

’ her journey started in 2010 after waving son @entity26 , 10 , and partner @entity25 off to the shops			1
@entity10 recalls : ‘ i was too fat to go with them so i made myself a cup of tea and went into the garden to drink it			2
‘ i got up to make another and that was the last thing i remember			0
’ she woke up to see @entity25 and @entity26 staring anxiously at her face			1
she says : ‘ i did n’t know what had happened , but @entity25 sounded terrified and said he was calling an ambulance			2
’ @entity10 piled on more weight with each of her two pregnancies with @entity26 , pictured , and his sister @entity88 , 15 @entity10 admits that before she lost weight her usual diet consisted mainly of takeaways , pasties , crisps and chocolate at @entity95 she was treated for cuts and bruises			1
the doctors diagnosed heat exhaustion caused by her weight			1
‘ i knew i was big at 22 stone and a size 30 , but it was a shock to hear i was so big i had just passed out going to make a cuppa			1
' of course i ’d always hated my weight but it had never affected me in such a serious way before			2
' @entity10 was upset to see how distraught her son and partner were			2
‘ when @entity30 explained that hey both thought i was dead and i could see how shaken they were because they had tears in their eyes just talking about it			0
' @entity30 gave me some tough love			0
he told me it could n't happen again , that he could n't face seeing me like that and i had to lose weight for all of our sakes			2
‘ he was n’t being nasty , he wanted to help me			0
’ @entity10 agreed , but having been overweight since hitting her teens she knew losing weight was going to be easier said than done			1
‘ i ’d fallen in love with food as a teenager , and my weight had been an issue since the age of about 14			2
’ @entity10 ended up becoming a recluse and was diagnosed with agoraphobia , spending her time sleeping and eating she ’d attempted countless diets over the years but always ended up going back to her usual diet of takeaways , pasties , crisps and chocolate			2
she piled on more weight with each of her two pregnancies with @entity26 and sister @entity88 , 15			1
‘ i used my pregnancies as an excuse to stuff my face without feeling guilty			0
it was the only time i could justify the huge amount of food i was eating			0
’ though she wore a smile , @entity10 admits that she was wracked with crippling shame over her weight and started avoiding social situations			1
‘ i arranged nights out with my mates and @entity30 , but i would always cancel at the last minute with some lame excuse , but the truth was i just felt too embarrassed about the way i looked to have a good time in public			0
’ @entity10 says losing weight has given her her life back at one point she had even been diagnosed with agoraphobia caused by the shame of being so fat			1
‘ @entity30 was the breadwinner because ultimately my confidence got so low i could n’t even face leaving the house to work			0
‘ i packed in the job i loved as a machinist because leaving the house got me in such a sate			0

@entity10 followed @entity188 online and hired a treadmill from a local gym equipment hire company			1
‘ i was too heavy for standard home treadmills so needed a stronger one , ’ she says			0
and true to his word , @entity25 researched the @entity188 diet and started writing down everything she ate to keep track of her calories			1
together they cleared the house of crisps , sweets and treats and filled the fridge with salad , lean meat and veg			0
in the first week she lost 11lbs and a further 7lb the second week			0
‘ i do n’t want it to sound easy because it was n’t ’ she explains			0

every time she feared falling off the wagon , her partner would remind her how upset they had been seeing her ‘ dead body			2
’ ‘ it was all i needed to get back on the diet			0
finally after losing four stone she felt more confident about leaving the house			0
‘ i had a panic attack and we had to go home again			0
but at least i had made it out			0
