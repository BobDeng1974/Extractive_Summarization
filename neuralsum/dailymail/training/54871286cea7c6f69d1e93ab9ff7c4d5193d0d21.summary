what is it about airplanes that makes good manners fly out of the window ? whether it 's stealing an armrest , pulling up your knees and resting them against the chair in front or refusing to acknowledge your neighbour for ten hours - we behave uncharacteristically un-british when air born			1
research by travel search engine kayak.co.uk proves what we 've long suspected			1
the research says that 10 per cent of us snub our time - honoured love of queuing to overtake when boarding to get a better seat on the plane and 55 per cent of us see red when the person in front reclines their chair without asking			1
fly nice : the survey found that we dispense with pleasantries and ignore neighbours during flights other top irritants , according to the poll , are overly chatty passengers , rudeness to cabin crew , eating smelly food , snoring and misbehaving children			1
to realign our sense of propriety , etiquette expert and author @entity56 gives us his jet - iquette guide to being the perfect plane passenger , and how to deal with ill - mannered neighbours : 1			1
the @entity63 ah , the age - old armrest dispute			1
think of it as a seat divider , rather than an armrest and problems will ease			2
inch your way in by placing just your elbow on it , which will leave plenty of space for your greedy neighbour to use it for their elbow – then everyone 's a winner			2
armrest hogger : there 's always room for two			2
inch your way in by placing just your elbow on it 2			0
the @entity84 if your neighbour strikes up conversation , engage for a short while – it wo n't hurt you ; they are only being friendly			0
we @entity90 find it difficult to be honest and direct but do n't be afraid to say , ' i 'm so sorry to be so anti-social but i 'm just going to shut my eyes for a while ' or words to that effect			0
chatterbox : @entity56 says ' it wo n't hurt ' to engage them for a while then tell them are going to sleep @entity101 : the best etiquette to deal with a sleeping personal space invader is by coughing to wake them up 3			1
the @entity105 it 's really quite flattering that the stranger next to you thinks of you as snuggle - material when they fall asleep			1
but one must respect personal space boundaries , especially in confined spaces			0
cough repeatedly to jolt them out their slumber , they wo n't cuddle up to you again if they think you 're harbouring germs			0
the @entity120 sadly , the only way to deal with a @entity120 is to be one yourself – if you ca n't beat ' em , join ' em. just make sure you recline your seat once the meal service has been completed			0
also , a glance behind to check that they are n't using the tray table for a laptop or children 's colouring book is also sensible and gives a subtle yet polite warning to the person behind			1
chair recliner : flight fire with fire on this one and recline your seat but check behind first with a quick glance @entity139 : invest in a good pair of earplugs to drown them out rather than impolitely elbowing them in the ribs 5			1
the @entity139 the ultimate solution to deal with the noisy sleeper would be to invest in a good pair of earplugs or noise - cancelling headphones			1
many of us dream of employing a more unorthodox method : a sharp elbow to the ribs , but in reality the only way to combat the snorer is to block out the sound			0
the @entity159 you find yourself needing the toilet during the flight but are faced with an awkward human obstacle			1
in the event of this happening , you are left with one option only : gently tap the sleeping offender on the shoulder and ask them to move			0
under no circumstances must you attempt to clamber over the person , as it 's likely you will disturb them anyway and be caught in an uncompromising straddle position			1
aisle seat snoozer : under no circumstances attempt to clamber over the person which will look uncouth 7			2
the @entity178 should you have a tipsy passenger near you , heed this warning : avoid any eye contact at all costs			0
any direct exchanges with the intoxicated individual and you may land up with an enemy on your hands at 30,000 feet – or even worse , a new best friend			0
it 's much wiser to alert the staff rather than try to intervene yourself			0
the @entity191 member nobody likes a brisk flight attendant , but confrontation in front of others will only make matters much worse			1
if you have an issue , quietly ask to speak to the cabin manager or , better still , write a firm letter once home			0
merry flyer : avoid eye contact with tipsy passengers			2
alert staff rather than intervening yourself feral children : statistically you are bound to come across feral children on pretty much any flight 9			2
the @entity211 statistically you are bound to come across feral children on pretty much any flight			2
if there 's space , ask the cabin crew if you can move seats to get away from the little rug rats			0
if not , those earplugs or noise - cancelling headphones are proving to be a sound investment indeed			2
@entity223 should the darling youngster behind be incessantly kicking your seat , simply turn around with a nice smile , and very politely ask if they would mind stopping			0
resist temptation to show your distress – children act up more if they if they sense vexation in adults .			0
