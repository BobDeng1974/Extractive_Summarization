it is the largest private yacht ever built and is set to launch a new round of one - upmanship among the world 's super-rich			1
at 590ft , @entity5 is 57ft longer than @entity9 oligarch @entity8 's superyacht @entity6			1
the @entity12 owner 's vessel had been the world 's biggest yacht – until @entity5 's launch in @entity16 yesterday			1
longer than 12 double - decker buses , not only is @entity5 the biggest superyacht , it is also expected to be one of the fastest			2
the 94,000 horsepower vessel could reach speeds of more than 30 knots , or 35mph			0
the size of superyachts has grown as billionaires compete to own the largest and its builders boast that @entity5 , which means dedication in @entity43 , is the ' most complex and challenging yacht that has ever been built '			1
it was designed by @entity46 and constructed in @entity47 by @entity48			0
the firm 's @entity48 said : ' she truly represents another milestone in yachting history			0
' @entity53 is known about the interior of the yacht , which will require a staff of 50 and will be delivered to its owner later this year			0
but it is likely to match the luxury of @entity8 's @entity6 , which features an armour - plated master suite , two swimming pools , two helipads , a hall , a cinema , a mini-submarine and even its own missile defence system			1
longer than some cruise ships : @entity5 is described as the ' most complex and challenging yacht ' ever built no expense spared : new super-yacht @entity5 has taken one year to design and three years to build @entity8 has owned @entity6 , which is valued at £ 740million , since it was launched in 2010			1
it took the title of world 's biggest private yacht from the 454ft @entity75 , owned by @entity77 businessman @entity76 , which in turn took over from the 414ft @entity80 , owned by @entity82 co-founder @entity81			2
prince @entity27 , who is said to be worth around £ 10billion , already has @entity83 , a yacht formerly owned by @entity28 arms dealer @entity85 , in his fleet			2
if he is confirmed as the owner of @entity5 , it will be the second time the 58 - year - old has got the better of @entity8			1
the 46 - year - old @entity9 was denied a berth at @entity92 harbour on the @entity93 in 2011 as the prince had docked another of his yachts , the 265ft @entity96 , in the last remaining space			0
@entity6 's crew pleaded for a berth but were eventually forced to drop anchor at sea and travel to the @entity9 's villa on a motorboat			2
@entity5 's design suggests it has been built for a buyer in the @entity106 as it has about 50 suites but no large open spaces on deck , said @entity111 's @entity110			1
' i have never seen an @entity114 - owned yacht with big parties and girls round the pool like the @entity9 have , ' he said			0
' it is unlikely it will leave its dock very often			0
it is more of a question of prestige , to have the world 's largest yacht			2
' you would n't want to turn around in a hurry : @entity5 is 54ft longer than @entity8 's @entity128 @entity8 's yacht @entity6 is smaller but boasts essentials such as two heliports , several jacuzzis and bulletproof glass plenty of room for the crew : the mystery buyer , whom some suspect may be a @entity28 royal , will have rooms to spare at 590.6ft long , @entity5 is longer than 12 double - decker buses parked end - to - end			1
at her widest point , known as the beam , @entity5 measures 68.2ft , while her hull is 15.8ft deep			0
she 's heavier than @entity6 , too , with an estimated gross tonnage of @entity150 - roughly equivalent to 1,750 adult african elephants			2
powered by two gas turbines and two diesel engines , she will boast an impressive 94,000 horsepower and a top speed in excess of 30 knots			0
the world 's largest super-yacht , @entity5 , has been commissioned for a mystery owner and launched in @entity16 today @entity5 's fuel tank can hold one million litres and she will have a top speed of in excess of 30 knots			1
it took the world 's top engineers one year to design @entity5 and three years to build her - but this is considered super-quick in ship - building terms			1
the owner of @entity5 is rumoured to be a member of the @entity171 , but the whole project is shrouded in secrecy			2
interior features will include a 29ft salon and a stunning , open - plan interior			0
@entity93 interior designer @entity177 was briefed to produce a sophisticated and yet timeless interior with a turn - of - the - century , @entity180 style			0
@entity8 's @entity6 is 533.1ft long and 72.2ft wide , and has an estimated gross tonnage of @entity182			1
@entity6 , owned by @entity8 , has been revered by yachting enthusiasts for years on account of her size she has four diesel engines and a maximum speed of 22 knots , which means @entity5 will far outstrip her should the billionaire owners decide to have a race			1
the yacht can accommodate 36 guests in comfort , and boasts a cinema , conference facilities , children 's playroom , beauty salon , dance floor , swimming pool and sauna			0
built by @entity205 and designed inside and out by @entity206 , @entity6 was custom - made for the @entity12 oligarch in 2010			1
both ships are so huge , they would have trouble fitting into the majority of the world 's marinas			0
only a handful , including @entity214 and @entity92 on the @entity93 would be large enough to accommodate them			0
however , despite @entity5 eclipsing @entity6 today , neither of them comes close to the @entity218 in terms of scale			2
built in 1912 , the ill - fated @entity218 was 882ft long and 92ft wide .			0

new *mega-yacht* took four years to design and build and is largest in world
called @entity5 , it has been built for a mystery client whom some say is @entity28
@entity12 owner @entity8 's 533ft @entity6 now just second - largest in world
