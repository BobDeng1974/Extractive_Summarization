true to form , the celebrity lawyer known in legal circles as the ' @entity2 ' is not letting a little thing such as being laid up in hospital get in the way of extracting every last penny for her wealthy clients			2
@entity9 has spent this week firing off emails and fielding calls on her mobile phone from her bed in the swanky @entity14 in @entity15			1
so what exactly has laid her low ? a tummy - tuck operation , she tells me cheerfully between visits from her nurses in her well - appointed private room			2
rivals : celebrity divorce lawyers @entity9 ( left ) and @entity25 , pictured out in @entity26 , central @entity27 , are involved in a court battle such cosmetic tweaks , the glamorous 45 - year - old miss @entity9 points out , are vital if she is to impress her well - off , mainly female , clients			1
' and i do a lot of television , ' she adds			2
' it 's all to do with public image			0
' likewise , she says she would n't be seen dead without her vast wardrobe of @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity41 business suits			0
and she arrives for meetings at the wheel of a red , open - top classic @entity45			2
' it 's a 1984 model , ' she explains			0
' i grew up watching @entity48 and @entity49 drove one exactly like it			0
it 's the epitome of glamour			0
' suffice to say , the colourful miss @entity9 , who runs her own £ 10 million - a - year legal firm , is not your average divorce lawyer			1
no wonder she 's causing ructions in the cloistered world of @entity27 's top matrimonial solicitors			0
not least because she 's gone into battle with the most formidable of adversaries : her former mentor and rival for the role of @entity65 's top celebrity divorce specialist , @entity25			1
cigar - chomping lawyer @entity25 with @entity67 leaving a restaurant in @entity26 , central @entity27 nicknamed ' @entity69 ' because of his fearsome reputation , he 's won millions for clients who have included @entity73 's ex @entity72 , @entity74 and @entity76 's former wife , @entity75 , who he advised during her £ 1.2 billion split from the @entity15 oligarch			1
cigar - chomping mr @entity25 is n't a man you 'd want to be on the wrong side of			1
yet it 's been reported that miss @entity9 has been caught red - handed trying to steal rich and famous clients from under his nose			1
and it 's caused @entity87 — who has , until now , always insisted on keeping a low profile — to come out fighting			0
' it 's a very poor show , i 'm afraid , ' an angry @entity25 told me this week			1
' i think it 's so underhand , particularly as i helped her in her career — talk about biting the hand that fed you			0
' the row has erupted over claims the law firm @entity100 owns hijacked the website of @entity103 's @entity26 - based partnership @entity103			1
her firm , @entity104 , paid for an advertisement on the website @entity108 which meant anyone using @entity108 to search for @entity25 's company was led to a ' puff ' for his rival 's operation			1
legal eagle : glamorous lawyer @entity9 appearing on @entity115 show this morning under the logo of @entity25 's firm , the advert boasted : ' @entity104 is a world - renowned , top family law firm , dealing with many high - profile cases ; from celebrities and foreign royals to high net - worth and international individuals			1
' much worse , as far as 73 - year - old tooth is concerned , it implied that he was past it and that miss @entity9 was his heir apparent			1
the promotional spiel continued : ' sharing elements of @entity126 's flamboyant and forceful style , @entity9 has been described by senior members of the profession as the modern successor to the family law “ crown ” , which @entity25 wore through the @entity136 and @entity137			1
' ' @entity104 ' , it added , ' have had a number of clients transfer to them from @entity87			0
' no wonder mr @entity25 is incandescent			1
miss @entity9 claims the whole thing has been a misunderstanding caused by an over-zealous advertising agent			1
but @entity25 insists it 's a case of dirty tricks orchestrated by his ambitious former underling			1
in response , he hired lawyer @entity149 of @entity151 firm @entity150 to have the advert removed			0
now @entity104 have settled the case out of court by agreeing to pay £ 5,000 in damages and another £ 38,000 in costs			0
they 've also had to promise not to do it again , although they deny liability			0
the row has highlighted a major clash of styles			0
while the ageing mr @entity25 avoids the limelight , meeting his famous clients late at night to keep their identities secret , the thrusting miss @entity9 boasts openly about her court successes and is a regular face on television , including @entity115 's @entity168			1
despite the settlement , @entity25 does not seem inclined to let bygones be bygones			1
' it was an absolutely naked attempt to get our business , ' he told me this week			0
' i do not accept that @entity9 somehow excuses herself and her firm from what happened			1
' this whole argument has been about someone behaving in a way where they pinch another person 's clients in the most unscrupulous way			0
and to suggest she did n't know about it is nonsense			0
' but miss @entity9 was quick to hit back			1
in a pointed dig at her former mentor , she insisted : ' we 've had most of the high - profile divorces of the past year , so we 've got enough to keep us busy without @entity126 's clients as well			2
it 's always difficult for our competitors when we expand our market share			0
we 've got a very modern way of doing things			0
' the fall - out comes as the battle to land @entity65 's biggest divorce cases turns increasingly hostile			1
newcomer @entity200 , the daughter of a single mother , won a place at @entity203 and qualified as a barrister before launching her own firm in 2005			0
the divorced mother - of - three divides her time between a rented £ 7 million @entity208 - style mansion next door to @entity210 , a £ 1.7 million @entity211 house she owns in @entity213 and a stylish farmhouse in southern @entity215			2
@entity9 made her name acting for @entity217 who sued her estranged husband @entity218 over the enforcability of a pre-nuptual marriage agreement she made her name acting for @entity221 , the @entity222 heiress who won a landmark case in the @entity224 in 2010 which ruled a pre-nup to protect her £ 100 million fortune from her @entity229 - born ex-husband was legally binding			1
she currently represents former miss @entity231 @entity230 , who is seeking £ 500 million in her divorce from her @entity234 - owner husband @entity233			1
against miss @entity9 is the equally flamboyant tooth , who , like his protegee , charges a reported £ 500 - an - hour			1
in 2005 , after his divorce from second wife @entity239 , he bought a £ 5 million townhouse in @entity15			2
meanwhile , he 's known for being driven around town in a £ 220,000 navy - blue @entity222 - built @entity243 limousine , which comes with its own @entity245 - stocked bar			2
his reputation for being ruthless has brought the @entity248 - educated lawyer a host of rich clients			1
he won £ 4 million for @entity72 in her divorce from @entity73 , plus a £ 2 million house and £ 15,000 - a - month maintenance			1
he also helped @entity254 walk away from her marriage to golfer @entity256 with £ 15 million			0
court battles : @entity258 businessman @entity76 and his wife @entity75 before their split ( left ) and ( right ) @entity65 actor @entity73 and his wife @entity72 ironically , @entity25 also represented miss @entity9 in her 2000 divorce from fellow lawyer @entity264 , with whom she has two sons @entity266 , 18 , and @entity267 , 17 ( she also has a daughter @entity268 , 11 , from a later , failed relationship )			1
but despite his low public profile , mr @entity25 has been touched by controversy on occasion			2
in 2011 , @entity273 , a former filing clerk at his firm took him to an industrial tribunal claiming that when he found out she was pregnant , he offered to ' kick the baby out of her stomach '			0
the lawyer , who denied ms @entity273 's claims , did admit asking her to scratch his back			0
miss @entity273 lost the case when it was ruled that she had quit @entity103 before she was fired			2
meanwhile , @entity283 wrote in her 2007 memoirs that she decided not to hire mr @entity25 for her divorce from @entity286 after visiting the lawyer at his office			1
she said he ' frightened me so much i thought he was going to have @entity286 assassinated ! ' former commercial lawyer @entity200 joined @entity290 in 2001 but left the following year after falling pregnant with her daughter			0
nine years after launching her own firm from a room in her @entity27 home , she employs 50 lawyers and says her firm has had a 300 - 400 per cent growth rate in recent years			2
but mr @entity25 scoffs at her claims that she 's secured the majority of big - money clients from under the nose of his firm in recent years			1
' it 's complete nonsense , ' he says			0
' @entity9 's a self - confessed publicist			1
i 'm not here to empire - build			2
i have managed to keep confidential most of my well - known clients because i make a big effort to ensure it does n't get out			2
' part of @entity104 ' ethos is to get clients publicity , not realising that the judges do not like it and it hurts their case			0
but it 's all part of her own publicity campaign			0
' i do n't have personal ill - will , with the exception that i think what she did [ with the website ] was really underhand			2
' however , miss @entity9 is not overly repentant			2
' it 's one of those unfortunate things , ' she says			0
' an ad went out without my authority and as soon as we learnt about it , we got it taken down			0
' i 'm really looking forward to locking horns with @entity126 again , but only for our clients in the future			0
' for the time being , however , who 'd be brave enough to take bets on who 'll come out on top ?			0
