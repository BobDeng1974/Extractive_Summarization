former police motorcyclist @entity6 , 56 , won compensation after saying the loud bikes damaged his hearing mr @entity6 owns a @entity26 1300 bike but says it does n't have sirens and he does n't ride it as fast after retiring , he noticed he had hearing loss and tinnitus , and hospital tests confirmed that the father - of - three 's hearing had suffered because of his work on noisy motorbikes with sirens			1
mr @entity6 said he decided to take action after he spoke to a motorcycle officer from another force and realised @entity14 had done ‘ nothing ’ to help protect his hearing			1
the force settled the case without going to court and paid him £ 6,500 compensation			0
mr @entity6 said : ' all they had to do was provide us with regular hearing tests and the proper equipment , [ but ] they did n’t do anything			1
' the health and safety laws are in place to protect people at work but @entity14 was not interested			2
their attitude was : " just get the job done , we do n’t care how , just do it "			0
he added : ' in the last few years of service , they tossed us a pair of ear plugs but they were pointless because you could n’t hear the police radio while wearing them			0
we needed proper protection and to have our time on the bikes limited			0
big bikes : mr @entity6 worked for the @entity14 for more than a decade , responding to emergency calls ' my hearing has been damaged and they could have done something about it for ten years			1

a keen motorcyclist at home , he rides his own @entity99 1300 bike , but said this was taken into account by lawyers			0
mr @entity6 said his fight with @entity14 had nothing to do with money - he was motivated by his principles and he said : ' the difference is , i do n't ride my bike at those sorts of speeds , and it does n't have sirens			1
' mr @entity6 , who now works for a car dealership , said he brought the case as ' a matter of principle ' , and was not concerned about money			1

somewhere , somebody should be held to account			0
' his solicitor @entity120 said : ' i am pleased his hearing loss has been recognised as work - related and that he has some compensation			2
' a spokesperson for @entity14 ( @entity14 ) @entity126 : ' following a civil claim by former officer @entity6 , @entity14 agreed to pay mr @entity6 the sum of £ 6,500 compensation			1
' this was a result of informal negotiations between mr @entity6 ’s legal team and @entity14 , the force has never made a formal acceptance of liability for mr @entity6 ’s hearing damage			1
' the health and safety of our officers and staff is paramount to @entity14 , and as such we always look to review cases of this nature in order to continually improve our systems and processes			2
' tinnitus is a term that describes any sound a person can hear from inside their body			0
it is often described as a ringing in the ears but the sounds that can be heard include buzzing , humming , grinding and hissing			2
sometimes the sound beats in time with the person 's pulse			0
the condition can cause sleeping problems and depression but , in itself , it is not harmful			0
there is no underlying cure for tinnitus , which mostly affects people over 65 ( file picture ) the underlying cause is not known but it can be caused by earwax , an ear infection , stress , a head injury or exposure to loud noise			0
there is no single cure for tinnitus but sometimes it can be addressed by treating the underlying cause - for example , through removing earwax build - ups			0
tinnitus is often worse in quiet environments so some people benefit from listening to soothing sounds , such as the sound of the ocean			0
the condition is most common in people over the age of 65 but it can affect people of all ages			0
about ten per cent of the population are thought to have the condition , though most have it mildly			0
