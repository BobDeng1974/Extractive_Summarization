@entity0 and @entity1 are not the only @entity3 retailers whose networks were breached over the holiday shopping season last year , according to sources familiar with attacks on other merchants that have yet to be publicly disclosed			1
smaller breaches on at least three other well - known @entity3 retailers took place and were conducted using similar techniques as the one on @entity0 , according to the people familiar with the attacks			1
those breaches have yet to come to light			0
also , similar breaches may have occurred earlier last year			0
the sources said that they involved retailers with outlets in malls , but declined to elaborate			2
at least three other well - known @entity3 retailers have been hit suffered a credit card breach akin to that of @entity0 and @entity1 , according to financier pundits they also said that while they suspect the perpetrators may be the same as those who launched the @entity0 attack , they can not be sure because they are still trying to find the culprits behind all of the security breaches			1
law enforcement sources have said they suspect the ring leaders are from @entity32 , which is where most big cyber crime cases have been hatched over the past decade			1
only one well - known retailer , @entity1 , has said that they too have been victim of a cyber attack since @entity0 's december 19 disclosure that some 40 million payment card numbers had been stolen in a cyber attack			1
on friday , @entity0 said the data breach was worse than initially thought			1
an investigation found that hackers stole the personal information of at least 70 million customers , including names , mailing addresses , telephone numbers and email addresses			0
@entity1 said it was not sure if the breach was related to the @entity0 incident			1
most states have laws that require companies to contact customers when certain personal information is compromised			0
in many cases the task of notification falls on the credit card issuer			1
merchants are required to report breaches of personal information including social security numbers			0
it was not immediately clear if that was the case with the retailers who were attacked around the same time as @entity0			1
after being forced to admit their credit card hacking scandal late last year , on friday @entity0 announced an investigation had found hackers stole the personal information of at least 70 million customers , not the 40 million first anticipated the @entity75 and @entity76 , which are investigating the @entity0 breach , declined to comment on saturday			1
@entity0 has still not disclosed how the attackers managed to breach its network or siphon off some of its most sensitive data			1
the sources who spoke to @entity82 about the breaches said that investigators believe the attackers used similar techniques and pieces of malicious software to steal data from @entity0 and other retailers			1
one of the pieces of malware they used was something known as a @entity95 scraper , or memory - parsing software , which enables cyber criminals to grab encrypted data by capturing it when it travels through the live memory of a computer , where it appears in plain text , the sources said			1
while the technology has been around for many years , its use has increased in recent years as retailers have improved their security , making it more difficult for hackers to obtain credit card data using other approaches			1
luxury merchant @entity1 confirmed saturday that thieves stole some of its customers Â¿ payment card information and made unauthorized charges over the holiday season @entity119 issued two alerts last year about a surge in cyber attacks on retailers that specifically warned about the threat from memory parsing malware			1
the alerts , published in april and august , provided retailers with technical details on how the attacks were launched and advice on thwarting them			0
a @entity119 spokeswoman declined comment on the reports , which did not identify specific victims			0
it was not clear whether @entity0 's security team had implemented the measures that @entity119 had recommended to mitigate the risks of being attacked			2
yet a law enforcement source familiar with the breach said that even if the retailer had implemented those steps , the efforts may not have succeeded in stopping the attack			0
that is because the attackers were more sophisticated than the ones in the previous attacks described in the @entity119 alerts , according to the source			0
the source asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly			0
retailers are often reluctant to report breaches out of concern it could hurt their businesses			0
@entity0 only acknowledged its 2013 attack after security blogger @entity162 reported the breach , prompting inquiries from journalists and investors			2
@entity1 said an outside forensics firm discovered evidence on january 1 that indicated the retailer had been the victim of a cyber attack			2
it disclosed the breach nine days later , after another inquiry from @entity162 , who was following up on reports about a surge in fraudulent charges traced to the retailer			0
sources say that hackers are using pieces of malware known as a @entity95 scraper , or memory - parsing software , which enables cyber criminals to grab encrypted data by capturing it when it travels through the live memory of a computer , such as a checkout @entity0 and @entity190 waited more than two years to admit that they were victims in 2007 of notorious hacker @entity192 , who was accused of masterminding the theft and reselling of millions of credit cards and atm numbers			1
during his trial the companies were represented by lawyers who did not identify their clients as @entity0 and @entity190			2
@entity201 , vice president of risk management policy with the @entity202 , said banks and credit card firms like @entity119 are forbidden from naming merchants that have been breached , unless they disclose it themselves			1
' it is really frustrating to the bank and also the customer , ' @entity201 said			0
one of the sources who told @entity82 about the recent rash of attacks said the memory parsing malware cited in the @entity119 reports was among the tools that the hackers had used , but said they used other techniques as well			2
@entity0 spokeswoman @entity220 said the retailer is not commenting on the company 's investigation of the breach			2
' this continues to be an active and ongoing investigation			0
it would be inappropriate to discuss details at this point			0
' the credit hack at @entity1 - who are still yet to confirm how many customers have been affected - came as a shock to many shoppers , as the store is considered much more upscale than @entity0 @entity235 , a security analyst for @entity236 , @entity239 - based @entity238 information technology research firm , said she learned about a separate set of breaches , dating back no more than a few months before the november 28 @entity243 start of the holiday shopping season , from a forensics investigator			1
she declined to provide his name			0
' @entity0 was not the only retailer who got hit , but they got hit the biggest , ' @entity235 said			0
investigators believe that the early series of attacks on retailers staged before late november were mostly used as trial attacks to help the hackers perfect new techniques they then used against @entity0 , stealing payment cards at unprecedented speed , @entity235 said			2
@entity261 , director of @entity262 , @entity263 - based @entity260 information security firm 's risk and compliance practice , said that sophisticated cyber crime groups do that because they only have once chance to get it right before victims catch on			2
' you want to test it and make sure it works , ' @entity261 said			0
' then you push it out at the appropriate time and do as much damage as you can			0

both @entity0 and @entity1 were forced to admit their hacking scandals after they were made public in the media
sources say *authorities* believe the cyber thieves are operating out of eastern @entity32
it is also believed the thieves are using a *device* known as a @entity95 scraper , which enables them to grab encrypted data by capturing it as it travels through the live memory of a computer , such as a checkout
