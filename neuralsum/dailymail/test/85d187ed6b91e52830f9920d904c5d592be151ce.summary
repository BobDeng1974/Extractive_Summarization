the lightning - fast greens at @entity1 can be a daunting prospect for many first - timers at the masters			1
not so for @entity6 ’s @entity5			1
the 27 - year - old finished one - under but it was his monster putt for eagle at the par - five 13th that he was tweeting about afterwards			1
@entity11 's @entity5 carded an opening round of 71 at @entity1 on thursday his brother @entity14 , at home doing some diy on light switches , also tweeted : ‘ @entity17 @ willett1987 shot under par in 1st round of # masters2015 debut			1
who ’s living the dream ? ’ @entity5 admitted it was a dream come true to mark his @entity28 debut with an eagle and an opening round of 71 at @entity1			1
@entity5 holed a curling 60 - foot putt on the par - five 13th , an achievement which is traditionally rewarded with a pair of crystal glasses			1
' it 's the kind of thing you dream of when you 're a kid , boxing a long one across the green , ' said @entity5 , who had been unhappy with his approach to the green			1
' anywhere on that green you know it 's going to be a stupidly breaking putt , but the ball is up somewhere near your kneecaps when you are hitting the second shot so it 's always hard to hit a fade into a back right flag			2
' it had 18 feet of break , it comes almost backwards			0
' @entity5 , who qualified by being in the world 's top 50 at the end of last season following his victory in the @entity56 , was in the second group out at 7.56am			2
@entity5 felt he benefited from ideal conditions as the 27 - year - old was in the second group out at 7.56am and the 27 - year - old felt he benefited from ideal conditions and the experience of playing with 1987 @entity64 champion @entity64 , as well as amateur @entity65			1
' it really helped playing with @entity64 , ' @entity5 added			2
' he won it in 1987 which is the year i was born so we were having a bit of a joke down the first			2
he was brilliant all day and kept trying to egg me and @entity65 on			0
he helped settle the nerves quite quickly			0
' the first tee was awesome and second off there were already 20 or 30,000 people round the golf course			0
every shot you hit and every tee you walked on you 're getting clapped on to			0
' i feel like i should be here but you 're not trying to put too much pressure on yourself			0
to be here for all four days first time out would be nice , it 's one of those courses where the more you play it the better your chances are of getting it round			0
for a first time out we did pretty good			0
