power may corrupt but it can also makes people messy eaters , scientists have found			1
they discovered that influential people quickly develop bad table manners , such as chewing with their mouths open and showering crumbs all over themselves			1
psychologists think that temporary changes to the frontal lobe in the brain may be to blame , which makes people more impulsive and self - centred			1
in it , they divided volunteers into groups of three and arbitrarily appointed one of them as leader			0
they then gave the trio a boring task – devising some university policies – before bringing out a surprise plate of chocolate chip cookies			2
psychologist @entity24 and his team at the @entity26 , made the discovery when conducting an experiment that they refer to as the ‘ cookie monster study , ’ so called because of the @entity33 character ’s vigorous way of eating biscuits ( pictured in a stock image ) three months ago , scientists claimed that being in a position of power can change the way you speak to people			1
they said that the cues , such as talking more loudly with less variation in pitch - tell people who is really in charge , regardless of what an individual is saying			0
‘ our findings suggest that whether it 's parents attempting to assert authority over unruly children , haggling between a car salesman and customer , or negotiations between heads of states , the sound of the voices involved may profoundly determine the outcome of those interactions , ’ psychological scientist @entity67 of @entity68 said			0
in the experiment , ' high status ' individuals tended to make their voices go up in pitch slightly			0
powerful people had more monotonous voices without as much variety in pitch as more lowly workers			1
their voices also varied more in volume than the voices of students assigned low - power roles			0
it revealed that generally speaking , powerful people speak louder than others and that listeners naturally pick up these cues to work out people in positions of authority			1
in a video explaining the experiment , dr @entity24 explained : ‘ everybody takes one cookie , but all groups always leave one cookie on the plate , because they do n’t want to be that person that takes the last cookie			1
’ they discovered that half of the time , the leaders reached out to take the final cookie , perhaps showing they have become more selfish while in power			1
dr @entity24 said that one of his graduate students noticed that appointed leaders in the experiments often had bad table manners			1
‘ our high - power person is more likely to eat with their mouth open , lips smacking , crumbs literally like falling onto their sweater			2
it ’s ridiculous , ’ he said			0
he explained that ‘ when you powerful , you kind of lose touch with other people			2
you stop attending carefully to what other people think			0
’ this is because when people are given power , they share some traits with sociopaths			0
regions of the frontal lobe , referred to as the ‘ empathy network ’ help people detect other people ’s pain			0
victims of head trauma , who suffer damage to empathy networks , often become impulsive , so that model citizens with ‘ acquired sociopathy ’ can suddenly start swearing and yell at people , as well as feeling disconnected			2
‘ our lab studies find , if you give people a little bit of power , they look a little bit like those brain trauma patients , ’ dr @entity24 said .			0

powerful people are likely to be selfish when claiming remaining treats left on a plate at the expense of others , such as a final cookie
in an experiment by @entity26 , psychologists found that influential people also develop bad table manners
they were seen chewing with their mouths open and *scattering* crumbs
scientists think powerful people are more impulsive
