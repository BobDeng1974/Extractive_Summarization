by @entity1 reporter the @entity3 editorial board on saturday endorsed a repeal of the federal ban on marijuana , becoming the largest paper in the nation to back the idea as it compared the @entity12 government 's stance on @entity12 's most widely used illicit drug to the prohibition on alcohol from 1920 to 1933			1
the post on the newspaper 's website is part of an editorial series that in the coming days will explore different aspects of marijuana use , from health effects to how the criminal justice system treats it			0
' it took 13 years for the @entity12 to come to its senses and end @entity29 , 13 years in which people kept drinking , otherwise law - abiding citizens became criminals and crime syndicates arose and flourished , ' the editorial states			1
forward thinking ? the @entity3 suggested in an editorial published saturday that the @entity12 make pot legal ' it has been more than 40 years since @entity39 passed the current ban on marijuana , inflicting great harm on society just to prohibit a substance far less dangerous than alcohol			1
' the editorial under the headline ' @entity48 , again ' comes less than two years after voters in @entity50 and @entity51 became the first in the nation to sanction taxing and regulating pot at the state level for recreational users 21 years and older			1
marijuana stores have since opened in both states			0
a number of other states , including @entity61 and @entity62 , will vote this year on whether to take the same step , and polls from the @entity65 and @entity66 have shown a majority of @entity12 support legalizing weed			0
the @entity3 editorial cites the 658,000 arrests nationwide for marijuana possession in 2012 , and the fact such arrests disproportionately ensnare young @entity73 men			1
quick work : the call comes less than two years after voters in @entity50 and @entity51 became the first in the nation to sanction taxing and regulating pot at the state level it also finds moderate pot use poses no risk to otherwise healthy adults , but that concerns about the drug 's effects on the adolescent brain should merit banning its use by those under the age of 21			1
the @entity3 , which on its editorial web page showed a @entity12 flag with its stars morphing into marijuana leaves , is the largest newspaper in the nation to take an editorial position calling for an end to the federal ban on marijuana			1
' i think it ’s playing right into the hands of this big ( marijuana ) industry that seeks only to increase addiction while reaping profits , ” said @entity105 , co-founder of the group @entity106 which opposes legalization			2
a number of smaller newspapers , including the @entity110 , @entity112 - based @entity111 , have called for some form of legalizing or decriminalizing pot , which over 20 @entity12 states and the @entity116 allow for medical use			2
evidence : the @entity3 editorial cites the 658,000 arrests nationwide for marijuana possession in 2012 , and the fact such arrests disproportionately ensnare young @entity73 men @entity62 ( legalization ) @entity62 may seem like an unlikely place to follow the lead of liberals in @entity51 and @entity50 , but the state 's libertarian electorate may provide a good look at how a different breed of voters will respond to marijuana legalization			1
it 's early , but proponents have a big head start on fundraising and organization , led by the @entity139 based in @entity141 legalization failed in @entity62 in 2000 and 2004 , but advocates say the landscape has changed markedly since @entity144 the measure is approved , adults could use marijuana legally and purchase it at state - licensed stores , but use in public would still be illegal			2
@entity61 ( legalization ) @entity151 rejected legalization just two years ago but are all but certain to have a chance to reconsider this november			0
state elections officials have n't yet validated the signatures turned in last week , but advocates submitted far more than they needed			0
@entity61 has long been on the leading edge of the decades - long push to loosen marijuana laws			2
it was the first state to decriminalize small - scale marijuana possession in 1973 — a step that 's been taken in more than a dozen other states			1
marijuana use remains illegal , but possession of a small amount of the drug is punished with a citation and fine rather than a criminal charge			2
@entity61 was also among the first states to approve medical marijuana			2
unlike @entity61 's 2012 effort , the team behind the current initiative has strong backing from many of the groups and individuals who helped bankroll the successful campaigns in @entity51 and @entity50			1
@entity116 ( legalization ) the @entity183 says the group submitted 55,000 signatures for a legalization initiative on monday — twice the number required to put the issue before voters			0
the measure would allow possession of up to two ounces of marijuana in the nation 's capital			2
but the effort could be frustrated by @entity39 , which reviews all new laws in the @entity116 and has moved to block its other recent efforts to ease up on marijuana laws			1
last month , the @entity200 - controlled @entity199 took a big step toward blocking a decriminalization bill passed by city lawmakers			0
that measure would make marijuana possession a civil offense subject to a $ 25 fine , one of the lowest in the nation			1
@entity39 used a similar amendment to block the @entity116 from implementing its medical marijuana program for 10 years			1
@entity211 ( medical ) the push for more liberal marijuana laws is not limited to full legalization of the drug			1
@entity211 voters will be deciding whether to allow the drug for medicinal use			0
a poll by @entity220 in may found overwhelming support for medical marijuana in @entity211 , where it will require support from 60 percent of voters to pass in november			0
nearly 9 out of 10 voters said they support allowing adults to use the drug for medical purposes			0
support was over 80 percent for all age groups			0
state lawmakers voted this year to legalize a strain of low - potency marijuana to treat epilepsy and cancer patients			0
@entity235 ( medical ) @entity238 gov. @entity237 signed a bill earlier this month making his state the 23rd to allow medical marijuana , though his state will have one of the most restrictive programs in the country			0
the drug is n't expected to be available for at least 19 months while the state works out @entity248 with one of 10 diseases will be allowed to use the drug , but it must be ingested or vaporized ; smoking it will remain illegal			0
some advocates argued it is too restrictive but called it an important step .			0
