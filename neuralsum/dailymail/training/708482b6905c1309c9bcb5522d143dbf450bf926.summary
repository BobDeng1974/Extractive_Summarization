by @entity0 it ’s yet another example of how our @entity3 reserve and prudishness about sex leads to unnecessary misery in the bedroom			1
a recent survey found although one in five women suffer from vaginal dryness - a common condition that makes sex uncomfortable , painful and sometimes impossible - 90 per cent of women suffer in silence			1
even more ludicrous : a trip to the pharmacy for some simple gels and lubricants could solve the problem in an instant			0
vaginal dryness can make sex painful or even impossible , and 18 % say they have stopped having sex why do n’t the majority of women get help or know this ? because , despite being a society saturated in sexual images , important , helpful sex information about conditions like vaginal dryness simply are n’t talked about			1
so please women of all ages , stick with me and let ’s do it here and now ! you do n’t have to be ‘ old ’ to suffer from a dry vagina			1
too much alcohol , not enough water , where you are in the menstrual cycle , stress , not feeling aroused enough , menopause - all can stop our vagina ’s lubricating properly			0
without lubrication , his penis is n’t able to penetrate easily and sex feels uncomfortable , painful and - if severe - becomes impossible			2
not being ‘ wet enough ’ is the female equivalent of him not getting an erection : women feel embarrassed because they think he ’ll think they ’re not ‘ turned on ’ enough			1
if you ’re single , you avoid starting relationships , thinking the guy will think you do n’t fancy them			0
married women avoid sex not just because it hurts but for fear their partner will feel rejected			1
the survey of 2000 adults , found one - fifth of women were depressed because of vaginal dryness , a quarter said they felt ‘ less feminine ’ , nearly half felt ‘ old ’ because of it and one in 10 men said it had impacted on their sex life			1
a trip to the pharmacy for some simple gels and lubricants could solve the problem in an instant thirty - four percent of sufferers said it had driven a wedge between them and their partner - nearly a fifth do n’t have sex at all because of it ! forty - two percent experience pain during intercourse because of it , one third have incessant itching and a further 31 per cent feel sore after sex			1
but in true @entity3 style , instead of talking with our partners and doctors about it - and discovering instant , inexpensive , no - hassle solutions - most women say nothing			1
we ’d prefer to watch our sex lives disappear and threaten our marriages than speak up out of embarrassment			2
ninety percent of the women surveyed would n’t even talk to their female friends about it			2
this is utter madness ! madness because all you need to solve it are two simple products			0
first , a moisturizing cream that replenishes the dehydrated vaginal skin which stops sex feeling painful and you feeling irritated and itchy			2
this survey was commissioned by @entity115 , who manufacture a moisturizing cream designed to solve the problem			0
@entity118 , @entity119 , and various other brands also make one			0
the average cost is £ 11 and you can buy them at any pharmacy			0
the second product to buy is a good quality personal lubricant , also available from any pharmacy and online ( my own supersex lovelube brand is perfect for this ) for under a tenner			0
use both and the problem will usually disappear within two weeks			0
it ’s that easy - and most sex problems are that easy to sort as well			0
all it usually requires is a bit of honest communication , a visit to the doctor or a quick search on the internet for solutions and the problem is fixed			0
if only we could move past that @entity3 i - ca n’t - possibly - because - i ’m - too - embarrassed attitude , we ’d all be so much happier and healthier			2
