compared to the regular gatherings of the @entity1 and the bowls club at the village hall , the ‘ relationship support meeting ’ sounded a little unusual			0
quite how unusual only became apparent after the first few meetings at @entity6 near @entity7			1
the village hall had been used to hold a series of secret bondage classes			0
the workshops – complete with tea and biscuits – include ‘ spanking ’ and ‘ flogging ’ , activities reputedly made popular by the success of the @entity18 books			1
unlikely venue : the bondage day will be hosted at @entity21 , which was founded in 1908 and usually hosts groups such as the @entity1 and @entity23 according to a day programme , which has a £ 10 entrance fee , it will start with a guide to meet other ‘ kinksters ’ and a class in caning			1
‘ mr @entity35 will show you how to truly get a bottom ’s attention with canes , ’ the guide boasts , while ideas are given on the instruments ‘ suitable for spanking both naughty and not - so - naughty bottoms ’			1
bestseller ? : the event will teach aspects of @entity43 , popularised in @entity45 's popular series of novels the programme ends with the note : ‘ we ’d very much appreciate it if you could help us to pack up – stack chairs , collapse tables			2
’ but when it came to booking the hall , organisers @entity56 , a bondage group , appear to have been a little less frank			0
hall manager @entity58 , 51 , said : ‘ the woman who made the booking said it was a “ relationship support group meeting ”			2
' but it is not			0
it did not say bondage on the booking form			0
some of our little old ladies who come to play bingo will be upset			0
’ now all future classes have been cancelled			2
hall trustee @entity71 added : ‘ we will be investigating			0
’ @entity56 has a policy of not commenting to the press			0
an expert from a @entity77 tannery would have explained the intricacies of leather flogging devices , after which a choice was available between learning about the erotic applications of wax and a 30 - minute class on nipples			1
more advanced sessions towards the close of the event would have focused on electrified props including ‘ violent wand devices ’ , and later there was a financial session – ‘ kink on a budget ’ - exploring ‘ ways to indulge in @entity43 without breaking the bank ’			1
attendees were warned on the group 's website that they must stick to certain rules - including a ' no touching without asking ' policy , and a ' no choking games ' rule			2
everyone must also always have access to ' a cutting tool ' in case things go wrong			0
they were also told to stick to ' vanilla [ @entity113 ] dress and manners until you are well inside the venue ' so not to frighten the neighbours			2
however , after the hall 's trustees were made aware of the true activities they immediately withdrew permission to use the venue			1
quiet : the peaceful village of @entity6 near @entity7 , where the village hall has offered sessions in @entity43 whipped : a leather expert will lead a session on ' spanking and impact play '			1

@entity21 , near @entity7 , was set to host all - day bdsm workshop on *12* *october*
£ 10 day included sessions on spanking , flogging , ' erotic *hypnosis* ' and a 30 - minute class on nipples
still offered tea , biscuits , *sandwiches* and *crisps* throughout
but now the event has been cancelled by the venue as the application was made under ' *false* *pretences* '
