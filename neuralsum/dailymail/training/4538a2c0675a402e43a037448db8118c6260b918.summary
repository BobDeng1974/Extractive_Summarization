by @entity0 @entity1 is so large that when i ask its owner , film and television composer @entity7 , how many bedrooms there are , he confesses he does n’t know			1
‘ seven , i think , ’ he ventures , which turns out to be correct			2
not only is the house , in the @entity14 suburb of @entity15 , huge , it is also extremely old			1
it was built in about 1530 and has a range of original features , including @entity19 throughout			2
and there is also a secret tunnel , which is said to lead to the neighbouring stately home , @entity23			1
sprawling : @entity1 in @entity15 , @entity14 , owned by film and television composer @entity7 , has been put on the market for £ 4.6million @entity7 , 87 – who wrote the theme tunes for the television shows @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 – did much of his composing at the @entity34 listed house , where he has lived since 1962			1
it is on sale for £ 4.595 million			2
included in the grounds is a rose garden that was started by the late author dame @entity39			0
they were great friends and , through his film production company , @entity7 made several movies of her novels			1
when @entity7 mentioned how much he liked her rose bushes , @entity47 – who lived for 50 years at @entity48 , the other side of @entity50 from @entity15 – decided he must have them , and the bushes were transported to his garden			1
‘ she was a great professional , first - class , ’ @entity7 says of her			1
‘ she was a very good historian			0
' she basically was always telling the same story , a love story , but it was the authenticity of the background that mattered			0
’ long history : the @entity34 listed house has seven bedrooms and has a range of the original features from the @entity65 age when it was built @entity1 was built on the foundations of what is believed to have been the original @entity69 priory			1
as well as the seven bedrooms , one of which has an en suite shower room , the house has two bathrooms , a drawing room , a formal sitting room , separate dining room , family room , library , study and conservatory			0
the property also includes a former coach house and garage with attached stables			2
planning permission has been granted for this area to be converted into a separate three - bedroom home			1
@entity7 wants to sell because ‘ my mobility is not great , so we [ he and his wife @entity91 ] want to find something more suitable ’			1
but he has no intention of retiring : he is currently planning a film version of @entity28 and is working on new scores			1
he seems unfazed by the mbe he was awarded this year			0
all he will say is that ‘ it sounds good ! ’ he is happier , unsurprisingly , talking about his work			0
‘ theme tunes are like sneezing – they happen very quickly , ’ he says			0
‘ they are like calling cards so that the audience knows what they are in for			0
’ @entity7 has also written film scores at @entity1 , including the one for dr @entity107 , the @entity109 - directed 1964 satire starring @entity110			1
‘ film scores are a much more detailed , lengthy process , ’ he says			0
‘ you are writing for specific scenes and developments in stories and you have to play on the subconscious of the audience			0
that ’s the purpose of a film score			0
’ hot shots : mr @entity7 , who has lived in the house since the 1960s , wrote theme tunes for @entity28 , pictured , @entity29 and @entity30 at the house he says that while he does discuss each of his scores with the film ’s director , ‘ you have to come to your own conclusions of how to interpret the film musically ’			1
he explains how the writing process works : ‘ you see the whole film and then you identify where the music is going to play ’ – and adds that great film - makers set themselves apart because they ‘ realise you have to combine all the senses ’			2
‘ fifty per cent of film - making is down to the soundtrack , ’ he says			2
he recalls @entity109 asking him what he thought of dr @entity107 when he saw it			0
@entity7 told him : ‘ if you want the audience to feel as if they have been punched in the stomach , you ’ve done it ! ’ @entity109 replied : ‘ that ’s exactly what i want ! ’ @entity151 , director at estate agents @entity153 , says : ‘ @entity1 is the epitome of tranquillity and offers the ultimate in security and peace of mind			1
' perfectly designed to offer respite , this home boasts truly exceptional grounds and private access to @entity164			2
‘ with its enchanting grounds , which extend to 3.3 acres , it ’s no surprise that one feels as if they are miles out in the countryside instead of in the heart of suburbia			0
