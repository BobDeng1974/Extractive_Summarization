by @entity0 for @entity1 blocking people in is not the most obvious way of getting them to leave			2
but it worked for one farmer , who forced a group of travellers off his land by surrounding them with tractors			1
@entity10 took direct action when a group of six caravans arrived in his field on wednesday afternoon			1
the 53 - year - old initially turned to police for help – but they said it was a civil matter and declined to get involved			1
taking action : farmer @entity10 , 53 , took direct action when travellers took over his land and told him to take them to court - so he barricaded them in with his tractors and they asked to leave direct action : mr @entity10 said that the police had said they could n't help so he ' had to deal with it ' so he instructed his workers to drive tractors , trucks and diggers around the edge of the 1.5 - acre site to block in the travellers as police stood by			1
and less than three hours after their arrival , the group decided to depart			2
yesterday mr @entity10 , who rents the land in @entity38 , @entity39 , said : ‘ they went in and they were ruining the land and we wanted them out			1
the owner of the land did n’t want them there and we did what we could to protect the land			0
‘ i had asked them nicely to leave but they said they would n’t and that i would have to get a court order to move them on			1
’ he added : ‘ i contacted the police and they said it was a civil matter			1
we then decided to barricade them in until they went , with the police in attendance the whole time to keep the peace			1
’ once officers saw what was unfolding , they advised the travellers of section 61 of the @entity68			2
the law can be invoked when they are satisfied two or more people are trespassing on land and the owner has taken reasonable steps to make them leave			2
mr @entity10 added : ‘ i was glad we managed to sort it quickly and peacefully			1
‘ luckily , it happened on a day when we were not so busy harvesting , so we were able to act straight away , although even if it had been a busy day we would have still dealt with it			0
’ a farmhand said motorists beeped their horns in support as they saw the caravans leaving			0
this aerial image shows the 1.5 acre field in @entity38 , @entity39 where the barricade took place the farmer , who rents the site , circled in red , said it took place on a day when they were not busy harvesting , meaning they could act straight away one of the travellers said they had only stopped off for food and to allow their children to rest			1
inspector @entity101 added : ‘ they were peacefully dispersed without the necessity of us using police powers			2
the local land controller has been spoken to and no offences have been disclosed			0
’ he added : ‘ we always try and resolve such matters peacefully , although we do have powers to remove them if needed to			0
’ it is not the first time people power has been used to move on travellers			2
in june around 50 villagers took part in a four - hour protest to prevent a group from settling on their green			0
after 11 caravans arrived in the picturesque village of @entity121 , @entity122 , the residents surrounded the land and blocked off the entrance with their cars			0
although some of the travellers got through , the villagers managed to prevent the majority from parking up			0
and after several hours , the campaign was victorious , with police serving an eviction notice forcing the group to move on			0
however during the tense stand - off , some homeowners were warned by the police they could be charged with false imprisonment for blocking the travellers			1
one eyewitness said at the time : ‘ the villagers took it upon themselves to fight and not let anyone go in			0
they blocked the only entrance			0
it was a great result			0

@entity10 , 53 , asked travellers to leave but they said he must go to court
the farmer from @entity39 then called police who said it was a civil matter
mr @entity10 decided to use *machinery* to block them in and they asked to go
