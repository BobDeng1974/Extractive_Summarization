by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 is used to flying vips around the world but a recent passenger was one of their more unusual			0
the ' @entity6 ' flew a monkey more than 5,000 miles from the @entity8 to start a new life in the @entity10			2
a @entity11 , a small species of monkey no larger than a bag of sugar , was confiscated by police during a drugs raid in the capital @entity18			1
police kept @entity19 in a birdcage on @entity21 for eight months , feeding it baby food and bananas			1
the police did not know what to do with the primate which is a nocturnal creature and kept it in a birdcage on @entity21 , also known as ' prison island ' , for eight months , feeding it baby food and bananas			1
they called him @entity19 , which means ' buddy ' and began searching for a home			1
his plight came to the attention of dr @entity37 who runs the @entity39 at @entity40 in @entity41			1
other carriers refused to transport @entity19 so dr @entity37 contacted the government and said that the monkey must come to the @entity10 as an important conservation task			2
she said : ' it would have been a huge loss if a healthy , vulnerable animal had to be destroyed , but it was also really important for us to support the @entity8 authorities , and to send a message to other countries around the world that vulnerable creatures do n't need to be put down – organisations like ours will provide support and assistance to ensure that endangered species are n't allowed to die off			2
' i asked @entity2 for its help in flying the @entity62 ( very important primate ) to the @entity10 , and the airline responded immediately , because it has a history of supporting conservation projects			0
' @entity8 police called him @entity19 , which means ' buddy ' and began searching for a home captain @entity70 flew the small primate from @entity18 to @entity72			1
he said : ' travelling at more than 500mph with us , our special little guest was for once not such a @entity11			2
the news that we had a vip on board certainly created a buzz among customers in the cabin			0
we were very happy to offer a free ride – we knew this would be a different experience for our furry friend , so we made the journey as comfortable and cosy as possible			0
' @entity85 in @entity21 , @entity8			0
@entity19 was rescued from @entity18 during a drugs raid @entity87 , @entity89 's global product manager responsible for live animal transportation , arranged for the @entity11 to fly to the @entity10			1
miss @entity87 said : ' this was an unprecedented operation from @entity93			0
the welfare of the animals we transport is our top priority , so we always adhere to @entity99 live animal regulations			0
every detail had to be right – from the size of the container that the @entity103 was travelling in , to the way it was secured , and the temperature in the hold			0
we felt very strongly that with so few of these creatures in existence , this was something we had to help with			0
' the small monkey will spend the next four months in quarantine at @entity40			2
it is then expected to begin a new life at the @entity114 in @entity115 , with a new friend , a @entity11 called @entity117 , who has been without a companion since she arrived in the @entity10 fifteen years ago .			1

@entity11 is a species of monkey no bigger than a bag of sugar
