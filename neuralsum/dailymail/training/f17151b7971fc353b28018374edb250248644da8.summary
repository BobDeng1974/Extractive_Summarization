@entity0 grabbed the only goal as @entity2 dented @entity5 's @entity4 title aspirations with a smash - and - grab 1 - 0 win			1
the midfielder scored in the third minute as @entity5 , who entered the day 's early kick - off one point clear at the top of the table , fell to a first home defeat since august			1
@entity16 's men headed into the afternoon 's early game brimming with confidence having risen above @entity19 and @entity20 with a 1 - 1 draw at @entity22 on wednesday			1
@entity0 ( centre ) watches as his third minute shot is deflected into the goal for @entity2 to beat @entity5 @entity0 ( centre ) of @entity2 scored the first goal for his team after three minutes against @entity5 @entity29 ( right ) of @entity2 tries to protect possession from @entity5 striker @entity31 ( left ) @entity32 ( right ) slides across and blocks an attempt by @entity5 striker @entity31 ( second right ) @entity5 manager @entity34 has taken his side to the top of the @entity4 table @entity5 : @entity38 , @entity39 ( @entity40 , 66 ) , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 ( @entity47 , 79 ) , reach ( @entity48 , 57 ) , @entity49 , @entity50			1

subs not used : @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71			0
goal : @entity0 , 3 referee : @entity74 but they got off to a terrible start when @entity0 put the visitors ahead with a deflected strike			1
@entity5 responded well but , despite creating a glut of chances in the opening period , they could not find a way past the dogged rearguard led by @entity2 skipper @entity32			1
it was the same story after half - time , welcome news for @entity5 's rivals @entity19 and @entity20 in the promotion battle			2
@entity5 's position did not stop @entity16 continuing his rotation policy , with six changes made to the side that started in midweek			0
it was the sole enforced alteration that proved @entity5 's undoing , though , as @entity2 took an immediate lead			2
@entity38 , in the @entity97 because @entity98 was serving a suspension for his red card versus the @entity101 , saw a poor throw - out intercepted by @entity61			0
and the midfielder took full advantage , pulling back for @entity0 to fire into the bottom corner via a deflection			0
@entity5 almost bounced back immediately , only for @entity49 to fluff his lines having been picked out by @entity46 's well - worked free - kick			1
the home side looked the most likely to score thereafter , with @entity31 and @entity49 drawing smart saves from @entity56			2
@entity49 then went agonisingly close to levelling when @entity58 cleared off the line to deny the @entity112 after good work from @entity31 and @entity114			0
the onslaught showed few signs of halting as only last - ditch defending , and excellent saves from @entity118 to deny @entity31 and @entity45 , kept @entity2 ahead at half - time			1
@entity2 have been on an upturn in form in recent matches under @entity124 's guidance @entity58 of @entity2 ( right ) challenges @entity31 ( left ) during the match at the @entity126 @entity45 ( left ) of @entity5 tries to take the ball beyond @entity2 ' @entity64 ( right ) picking up where they left off , @entity5 applied further pressure following the interval , @entity31 seeing an effort turned around the post by @entity134			2
but @entity2 issued a warning shot of their own moments later when @entity57 nodded @entity138 's free - kick against the crossbar			2
any thoughts that his effort may herald a spell of visiting pressure were quickly extinguished , @entity56 again called into action by @entity31 and @entity145			0
@entity16 introduced top - scorer @entity146 midway through the second period in a bid to find an elusive equaliser			0
@entity57 of @entity2 ( left ) challenges @entity5 's @entity114 ( right ) for the ball @entity49 ( centre ) lies injured and the game was halted for five minutes as he received treatment @entity45 ( left ) puts in a challenge on @entity29 ( right ) of @entity2 during the @entity4 encounter yet even switching to 4 - 2 - 4 did not bring the desired goal , with @entity32 denying @entity31 after a sublime move			1
frustration then turned to worry inside the @entity126 as @entity49 was stretchered off with what appeared to be a serious head injury			0
that meant there were nine minutes of injury time , although @entity5 - down to 10 men having used three substitutes - could not force themselves level .			0

championship leaders @entity5 lose to @entity2 1 - 0 at home
@entity2 went ahead thanks to a third minute strike from @entity0
@entity5 striker @entity49 stretchered off and given *oxygen* on *88*
