by @entity0 when @entity2 took to the sea , hoping to become the first person to swim the entire length of @entity6 , his friends told him that the challenge would kill him			1
three million strokes later , and weighing a stone lighter , the weather - beaten adventurer managed to paddle across the finish line today			1
the 32 - year - old expected to steadily creep 1,000 miles northwards over an arduous two months when he left @entity14 in @entity15 on june 30			1
he faced a string of hazards along the way , swallowing more than 50 litres of seawater , battling bouts of seasickness and experiencing severe weight loss from the physical exertion of swimming ten miles every day			1
the list of hazards even resulted in the swimmer growing a ‘ ridiculous beard ’ in a bid to deter jellyfish after being stung ten times on the face			1
mr @entity2 , from @entity41 , @entity42 , had to eat pureed food during breaks from swimming as his jaw was too cold to chew			1
adventurer : the record - breaking swim is the latest of mr @entity2 's adventures			1
he climbed @entity49 dressed as a penguin and cycled 16,000 miles through six continents in 116 days with a fractured spine tough : mr @entity2 described himself as a ' nutter ' but said the experience was ' a dream come true ' but arriving at @entity18 – the @entity59 mainland ’s most northerly point – the swimmer broke into tears as he sealed his place in the record books he had spent just 90 days of the 136 swimming , with the remainder on dry land due to bad weather hampering his effort			0
each time he left the water – sleeping in a yacht or onshore accommodation – his coordinates were mapped and his support boat returned to the same spot to resume the swim when it was safe to do so			1
speaking after exiting the water the self - confessed ‘ nutter ’ described the experience as a ‘ dream come true ’			2
vision : @entity81 - born mr @entity2 has fantasised about reaching the harbour - staring at photos for motivation emerging : crowds gathered to see the swimmer clamber out of the waves after 136 days journeying bad weather : some of the days he was forced to get on dry land to recuperate during horrific storms sting - protection : mr @entity2 ' had to grow this ridiculous beard ' in the two months he was at sea although his feat will not be recognised by the @entity96 , due partly to him wearing a wet suit and occasionally using flippers , he does not mind			2
‘ i did n’t do it for the record books , ’ he said yesterday			0
‘ i did it for different reasons – for me , and to prove it can be done , and that anybody can do anything if they put their mind to it			0
‘ the hardest part was trying to deal with the weather , the cold , and jellyfish in the face			2
i had to grow this ridiculous beard to stop the stings			0
‘ @entity96 felt it was too difficult to attempt , and they probably did not want to be associated with it , but i have proved a lot of doubters wrong – though i ’m not sorry it ’s over ! ’ journey : marching out into the @entity15 sea two months ago , mr @entity2 did not know what he faced start : setting off from @entity122 at the start of the @entity124 exhausted : he was met at the finish by @entity127 , his mother , 60 , who said : ' he has a strong will and mind ' he was met at the finish of his ordeal by his mother @entity127 , 60 , who said : ‘ i ’m so proud of him			2
this is his biggest adventure – he has a strong will and a strong mind			0
’ after tasting his first endurance event at the age of ten , when he swam a mile across a lake , the adventurer went on to climb @entity49 dressed as a penguin and cycled 16,000 miles through six continents in 116 days , much of it with a fractured spine			1
mr @entity2 , who was born in @entity81 , revealed that he had been fantasising about swimming into the harbour , even keeping a picture on his computer to visualise the scene			0
in a toast , he said : ' the hardest part was trying to deal with the weather , the cold , and jellyfish in the face ' almost conceded : ' just a week ago i thought i might have to give up and finish next summer , ' he said team support : mr @entity2 's team embrace him as he struggles to stand on dry land he said : ‘ i ’ve been dreaming of swimming into the @entity18 harbour for a very long time			0
‘ i had a screengrab of the harbour on my laptop and i ’ve been looking at it for ages			0
to finally be here and be warm and dry and on land is a good feeling			0
‘ just a week ago i thought i might have to give up and finish the attempt next summer , with the bad weather , but we had a few good weather windows and i was able to finish it			0

32 - year - old became first person to swim the 1,000 - mile coast of @entity6
he was stung by jellyfish ten times leaving his jaw too numb to eat
set off on june 30 clean - *shaven* , arrived today exhausted and bearded
