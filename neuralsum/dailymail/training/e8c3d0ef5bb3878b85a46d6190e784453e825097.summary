by @entity0 @entity1 and @entity2 had a blazing row with their former @entity5 bandmate @entity4 on the day he died , culminating in @entity6 drawing a knife , according to an extraordinary claim made to police			1
in a bizarre twist in the mystery , @entity10 has seen documents in which the daughter of the man now thought to have been involved in @entity4 ’s death claims that the @entity5 ’ former guitarist was confronted at his @entity19 home by @entity1 and @entity6 over who owned the rights to the group ’s name			1
still going : the @entity5 on stage on saturday night in @entity25 but a mystery still remains over the death of their former guitarist @entity4 back again : this was the first time the @entity5 played @entity31 since their concert 44 years ago , two days after @entity4 was found dead hours later @entity4 was found dead in his swimming pool			1
the unsubstantiated claims , contained in an internal police report , were dismissed by officers , but will add further fuel to the conspiracy theories that surround @entity4 ’s death in 1969 and question whether he really did drown under the influence of drink and drugs			1
the allegation comes after the @entity5 played in front of 65,000 fans at @entity25 ’s @entity31 last night , re-enacting the emotive tribute they gave for @entity4 at the same venue 44 years ago			1
last night ’s concert was the first time the @entity5 have played at the park since their requiem for @entity4 two days after he was found dead			1
the source of the claim is @entity53 , the daughter of @entity54 , @entity4 ’s builder - cum - minder who was present at @entity4 ’s farm on the night of his death			1
a year later , it was claimed that he had murdered @entity4			1
@entity60 appealed on tv for information and @entity53 telephoned them about the alleged incident			0
bandmates : @entity2 with @entity4 in 1967 , two years before @entity4 's death her father told her that he intervened in the row between @entity4 and @entity6 , she claimed			1
titled ‘ @entity70 : @entity71 of @entity4 ’ , the police report states : ‘ she said that her father had told her a number of years ago that on the day of @entity4 ’s death , @entity73 @entity1 and @entity2 visited @entity4 at the farm in the morning and her father was present when @entity4 was asked by both men whether he would give up the name of the “ @entity5 ” to them and agree to a financial settlement			1
‘ @entity4 apparently declined to do so and it is alleged that @entity2 drew a knife			2
it is suggested that @entity82 calmed them down and both @entity1 and @entity6 left the house			0
’ @entity4 started and named @entity5 in 1962			1
last night , a @entity5 spokesman declined to comment on the claim			1
after the report was written , no further action was taken because a senior officer in @entity60 intervened to block standard investigating procedures , it is alleged			0
the @entity10 has traced the police officer who interviewed @entity53			0
the officer , who did not want to be named , said : ‘ i arranged to meet lawyers representing @entity1 and @entity2 – two firms , one in @entity97 and one in @entity98 – to talk specifically about @entity53 ’s statement to @entity60 , about them being at the house on the day of the death and about the knife being drawn			2
death : @entity104 in @entity105 where @entity4 died in the swimming pool ‘ but the assistant chief constable intervened and blocked me from meeting the @entity5 ’ lawyers			1
the @entity109 drew a line under it			0
the statements made to @entity60 by @entity53 should have led to what the police call standard “ trace and eliminate ” work – to prove or disprove any information the police have been given , and to work out if something did or did not take place			0
‘ but i was told to put details of @entity53 ’s interview into a report , and that was it			0
’ the astounding allegation is the most startling piece of material that @entity10 has uncovered about @entity4 ’s death			1
however , our enquiries have also brought to light further claims about what one band member may privately have suspected about it			0

taken by the late @entity145 between 1964 - 1966 @entity146 / @entity145 the @entity10 has ascertained that as far back as the 1980s , @entity6 was aware of suspicions that @entity54 killed @entity4 , and that @entity148 , a @entity5 manager , had led a cover - up			1
@entity150 , an @entity151 author and a former editor of @entity154 magazine , lived with @entity6 in the @entity155 in may 1971 , during the recording of the @entity5 ’ album @entity158			2
@entity150 recorded hours of conversations with @entity6 during this period , which reveal that the guitarist was aware of the alleged cover - up that @entity164 – who @entity6 called mr get - it - together – put in place			2
@entity6 told @entity150 about the aftermath of @entity4 ’s death : ‘ i wanted to know who was there and could n’t find out			2
the only cat i could ask was the one i think got rid of everybody and did the whole disappearing trick so when the cops arrived , it was just an accident			0
maybe the cat just wanted to get everyone out of the way so it was n’t all names involved , etc. maybe he did the right thing , but i do n’t know			0
i do n’t even know who was there that night , and trying to find out is impossible			0
’ there is also new evidence that in the 1980s @entity6 was aware of @entity54 ’s alleged involvement in @entity4 ’s death , via @entity190 , a former business partner of @entity1 and @entity138			2
chillaxing : @entity1 in his trailer he ’s the 69 - year - old frontman of a band famed for rock’n’roll excesses			1
but it seems time has finally caught up with @entity5 singer @entity1			2
he revealed that he prepared for last night ’s @entity31 concert by getting up early to do his chores			0
on his @entity199 page , @entity1 posted a picture of himself sitting on a leather sofa in salmon - coloured jeans and a somewhat creased pink shirt			0
with his hand resting on an @entity205 and a black ‘ manbag ’ on the sofa beside him , he added : ‘ beautiful day in @entity25 , ca n’t wait for the show			0
' been up early ironing my clothes			0
