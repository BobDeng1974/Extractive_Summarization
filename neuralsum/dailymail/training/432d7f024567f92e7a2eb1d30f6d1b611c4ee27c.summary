by @entity1 reporter created : 16:21 est , 20 april 2014 @entity2 , the @entity3 and @entity4 police officers were forced to hire a police car to go on duty – because the crime commissioner had borrowed theirs for a meeting			1
@entity2 , @entity10 , borrowed the car as hers had a flat tyre			1
but when she did n’t return it the next day , officers had no choice but to hire a replacement just so they could go on their rounds			2
the commissioner had been given a police ‘ pool ’ car which officers can book if needed , eventually returning it two days after she had borrowed it			1
an investigation was launched following a complaint , but miss @entity2 was cleared of any wrongdoing			1
the complaints committee which investigated the matter was told by the commissioner ’s office that her busy schedule meant she could not find time to arrange a repair			0
ms @entity2 's office said it was an ' oversight ' not to realise the car would not be able to be returned before other officers had booked to use it at 7am the next day			2
the police and crime panel said the £ 60.34 cost to hire a car for the officers was less than what @entity44 would have claimed in mileage expenses if she had been using her own car			2
however , a report explaining the circumstances to the complaints committee conceded that “ minor changes ” would be made to the way vehicles are used following the incident			0
the anonymous complaint that sparked the investigation was initially addressed to @entity58 leader @entity57 who passed it on to the panel			0
he said : ' the correct place to investigate this anonymous complaint was at the police and crime panel and i was not surprised no further action was deemed necessary			0
' some will be surprised the commissioner was authorised to use the vehicle in question and i understand procedures will be updated in light of this investigation			0

@entity2 , @entity71 , borrowed the police car after her own got a flat tire
she failed to return it in time for booking by officers the following *morning*
an investigation was launched into the incident but no action taken
we have been asked to make clear that @entity2 did not borrow a police patrol car . the borrowed car was a *civilian* car used by staff . we are happy to *clarify* this .
