by @entity1 reporter published : 19:41 est , 10 february 2013 updated : 19:41 est , 10 february 2013 a storm has blown up over the name of the huge nor'easter that dumped up to 40 inches of snow on the north - eastern @entity6 in the last few days			1
the @entity7 ( @entity7 ) began naming winter storms in october			1
this one was christened @entity10 , bringing up images of the cute orange fish in the @entity15 / @entity14 film @entity13			2
while the name nemo was widely used on social media , including by @entity20 mayor @entity19 , other meteorologists are refusing to use it			1
they claim that only hurricanes and tropical storms should be named and that this is a pr stunt by @entity7			2
@entity13 ? this ' snowfish ' appeared during the nor'easter that dropped up to 40 inches of snow on the north - eastern @entity6 but many meteorologists do n't think the name nemo should be used at all the @entity30 ( @entity30 ) , the official government agency , is responsible for naming tropical storms , which then keep their names if they develop into hurricanes			1
and the @entity30 is refusing to acknowledge @entity7 's monikers for winter storms			1
on thursday a spokesman said : ' we never have , nor do we have any plans to consider naming winter storms			1
' a spokeswoman told @entity40 started naming winter storms , that 's their project , ' she said			1
the @entity30 also put out a statement explaining their policy : ' the @entity30 does not name winter storms because a winter storm 's impact can vary from one location to another , and storms can weaken and redevelop , making it difficult to define where one ends and another begins			1
' yet the name nemo was widely used in many places , including by @entity20 's mayor , @entity19 , and on @entity55			0
@entity56 , the actor who voiced @entity10 ’s dad , @entity57 , in the hit film , tweeted : ' they have named this new nor’easter nemo			2
i am not looking for it			0
' whatever you call it , the winter storm blanketed the north - eastern states in snow			0
here , the thaw begins on cars parked at a dealership in @entity71 , @entity72 on sunday february 10 @entity7 started naming winter storms in october , claiming that attaching a name would raise awareness about the dangers of extreme weather			1
' the fact is that @entity55 needs a hashtag , ' @entity78 , a @entity7 meteorologist responsible for winter weather , told the @entity82 recently			1
but others were annoyed by @entity7 taking it upon itself to name storms			2
as reported by the @entity88 , @entity86 , founder of @entity87 , issued a statement in fall criticizing the @entity7 for its actions			2
' in unilaterally deciding to name winter storms , the @entity7 has confused media spin with science and public safety , ' @entity86 said			1
' we have explored this issue for 20 years and have found that this is not good science and will mislead the public			0
winter storms are very different from hurricanes			1
' nearly two feet of snow blanketed @entity102 , including a bank of pay phones on @entity105 in front of the @entity107 @entity108 , a meteorologist at @entity109 , said : ' a named storm should be a hurricane , and only a hurricane			0
' a hurricane is something that 's more unusual and devastating			0
if you start naming other storms , people will suddenly think this might be a hurricane			0
' the @entity88 reported @entity120 , a meteorologist with @entity121 , saying : ' this is more of a pr stunt by the @entity7			0
it 's not something the government is running with			0
' there 's not really a hold - fast criteria to determine when to name it like there is with hurricanes and tropical storms			0
' @entity120 suggested that stations owned by @entity133 , which also owns @entity7 , would be most likely to use @entity10 to describe the storm			1
indeed , @entity133 channel @entity135 did use the name , while rivals @entity138 and @entity140 both called it a ' monster storm ' or a ' winter storm ' : if you were able to enjoy it , like this family in @entity147 , the snow created a winter wonderland local @entity150 affiliate @entity149 in @entity72 called the storm @entity151 , keeping with a long - standing station tradition of naming major winter storms affecting the state that dates back to the early 1970s			1
in relations to the name nemo itself , mr @entity78 told the @entity82 that ' nemo is a @entity160 word			0
' @entity78 helped designate storm names at @entity7 last year and said that the translation ( ' no one ' or ' no man ' ) was inspiration for the choice rather the film			2
@entity167 also claims that @entity10 , the memorable character from @entity170 's @entity169 ' also came up in discussions			2
' @entity10 was a pretty tough , fierce guy , ' mr @entity78 said			0

but other meteorologists *suspect* a *marketing* ploy and the *federal* weather agency wo n't use @entity10 to describe the huge nor'easter
