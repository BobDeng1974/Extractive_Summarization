one of the men who helped shape @entity1 has claimed a technology revolution means that traditional relationships will soon be a thing of the past			1
@entity7 , who coined the now - ubiquitous @entity1 hashtag , helping it achieve enormous popularity , has said the world has changed so much people no longer need a single partner			1
@entity7 , who used to work for @entity14 , said that the increasing wealth of the western world means people no longer need partners to meet their basic needs and care for offspring			2
@entity7 says he lives out his theory with his partner , who whom he has a ' committed ' relationship - but one in which both people are free to see others			1
he wrote : ' we 're committed to each other , but have a porous boundary around our relationship , meaning we 've agreed that it 's ok for either of us to express romantic feelings toward other people or to be physically intimate with other people , so long as we 're honest and transparent about our intentions with one another			2
path to non-monogamy ? @entity7 said hookup apps , like @entity31 , above , could change social norms ' these things do n't diminish the integrity of our relationship			1
rather , they deepen our understanding of each other 's wants and desires , and give us the space to grow independently , without growing apart			0
' @entity7 termed the catalyst for the predicted social change @entity65 - and said it could be as fundamental as the invention of the computer			1
according to the tech guru , the constant connections and the rise of mass - use apps like @entity72 , where you post to large audiences rather than individuals , feed in to the idea of having multiple partners			2
he wrote : ' @entity65 unbundles monogamy and sex			0
it offers to maximize episodes of intimacy while minimizing the risk of rejection or @entity86 [ fear of missing out ]			0
' today 's most interesting apps ( @entity72 , @entity89 , et al ) are designed to support @entity65 , offering discreet , asynchronous , anonymish , non-exclusive communications			0
' multiplied against algorithms that optimize the pool of potential partners for connection ( requiring no more than swipe left , swipe left , swipe right to operate ) , romantic partners are now more fungible [ interchangeable ] than ever			0
' @entity7 , an early adopter of @entity1 , though not an employee , made his contribution to social media history by suggesting users type a # symbol before key terms to organize posts			1
the trend took off , providing an easy way for users to make sense of sometimes - chaotic feeds and find posts they were interested in , and quickly became part of the internet 's vernacular .			0

@entity7 , who came up with @entity1 feature , said traditional models for relationships are *obsolete*
said he has ' committed ' relationship - but both of them see other people
claimed easy hook - ups apps and communication will change norms
