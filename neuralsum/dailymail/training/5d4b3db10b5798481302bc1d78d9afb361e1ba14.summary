twenty - five places separated @entity10 ’s cup holders and @entity12 ’s @entity11 underdogs when they upset the @entity14 odds thanks to the late @entity16 ’s goal and those heroes were back at the @entity18 yesterday			1

bookings : @entity62 manager : @entity76 5 referee : @entity78 7 attendance : 30,302 in that respect , there was perhaps mitigation for the seven changes made by @entity76			0
@entity55 , however , believes a cup run can facilitate momentum in the league			1
to that end , @entity55 should be applauded for naming a strong xi and won through to the fourth round courtesy of @entity24 ’s sweet strike			1
‘ we made a few changes ( six ) but it was a good team , ’ said @entity55 , whose side had not won at home since october 4			2
‘ we needed to win at home and we need the cup			0

if you think it ’s a distraction then you should go to the casino or the cinema			0
’ @entity27 ’s goal arrived on 33 minutes , a first - time shot into the bottom corner after @entity45 had rolled the ball into his path			0
the @entity109 left back had not played for two months since dislocating his shoulder at @entity111 and @entity55 admitted : ‘ it was a big decision to play him			2
' if something happened to him then you would all be killing me			0
' but we did n’t think it was a crazy risk and he was probably the best player			0
’ @entity4 could have nicked a replay when skipper @entity59 headed against the post in stoppage time			2
@entity76 reflected : ‘ i thought we were the better team in the second half			0
’ @entity4 were backed by 5,200 travelling fans and former @entity126 assistant @entity55 was impressed			1
‘ that shows the kind of fans they have and where they should be , ’ he said			0
@entity3 's @entity133 ( right ) is challenged by @entity66 of @entity4 @entity66 ( right ) vies for the ball with @entity3 's @entity35 ( bottom left ) and @entity34 a @entity3 fans shows he is up for the @entity6 by dressing in red and white stripes and holding a cut out of the @entity6 @entity3 's @entity40 receives treatment for an injury @entity3 's @entity45 ( right ) competes for a high ball with @entity4 's @entity142 @entity3 's @entity37 ( left ) tries to stop @entity4 's @entity67 during the @entity6 third round @entity144 ( right ) vies with @entity3 's @entity37 during the @entity6 @entity44 ( left ) of @entity3 challenges @entity145 as the @entity3 progressed @entity145 ( r ) and @entity56 of @entity4 react after the full time whistle at the @entity18 @entity4 manager @entity76 chats with @entity3 boss @entity55 before kick off members of the 1973 @entity6 winning side @entity150 ( left ) and @entity152 wave to the crowd before before the game			1
