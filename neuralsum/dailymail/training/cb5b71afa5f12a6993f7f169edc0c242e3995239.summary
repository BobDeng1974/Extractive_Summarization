sir @entity0 , who is to lead new research into the mass prescription of statins and their side effects a renowned professor whose research led to the mass prescription of statins is carrying out a major review into their safety			1
sir @entity0 of @entity10 is to examine the records of tens of thousands of patients to establish how many may have suffered side effects			1
the scientist has previously carried out studies showing that prescribing the drugs more widely could save 2,000 lives a year in @entity18 and prevent 10,000 heart attacks and strokes			1
his research helped shape @entity23 guidelines issued last year recommending that @entity24 offer them to around 40 per cent of all adults			2
he still believes the benefits of statins outweigh the risks – and warned of ‘ averse public health consequences ’ if patients stop taking them			2
but professor @entity0 has acknowledged that his earlier studies looking at the benefits of statins did not properly investigate all the side effects			1
these only looked at the possible risk of dying , suffering a heart attack or developing cancer			0
other known side effects include muscular pain , type 2 diabetes , nausea and memory loss			1
there is also concern statins increase obesity and inactivity as patients see them as a ‘ licence ’ to lead unhealthy lifestyles			2
professor @entity0 and his @entity10 colleagues will now review patient records from all the previous studies to check how many suffered ‘ adverse ’ effects			1
statins are prescribed to between five and ten million adults in @entity18 including those with heart disease or deemed at risk of suffering a heart attack or stroke in future			2
they work by reducing the level of cholesterol in the blood			0
statins are prescribed to between five and ten million adults in @entity18 including those with heart disease or deemed at risk of suffering a heart attack or stroke in future			2
they work by reducing cholesterol in the blood if this is too high , fatty deposits form on the walls of the arteries which can trigger heart attacks , strokes and sharp chest pain , or angina			0
very little is known about the risks of taking statins , as drug companies have refused to publish the data from their trials			2
but according to some studies , up to one in 50 patients can develop type 2 diabetes			0
a further one in 50 suffers from severe muscular pain that affects their daily activities			0
around one in ten patients experiences milder side effects that can include a runny nose , headaches , nose bleeds , nausea and a sore throat			1
several leading doctors have also revealed that they have stopped taking statins , after either experiencing side effects or failing to be convinced that they were doing any good			1
these include dr @entity105 , deputy chair of the @entity106 , who took them for two years and developed muscle pain			0
dr @entity109 , a vein surgeon from @entity110 , took them for eight years but found his cholesterol actually came down after he stopped			0
statins work by blocking the action of an enzyme responsible for regulating many systems and chemical reactions in the body , including the production of cholesterol and lipoproteins			0
the drugs have been used since the 1980s for their cholesterol - lowering properties , but in the last few years they have gained ‘ superdrug ’ status for their ability to prolong life			0
professor @entity0 , who was knighted for his services to science in 2010 , sent an email confirming his intentions last week			2
it said : ‘ in light of the concerns that have been raised about possible adverse effects of statin therapy ’ , the researchers are ‘ seeking individual patient data on all of the other adverse outcomes that were recorded in the trials			1
’ the email added that the study would attempt to work out the likelihood of patients suffering any form of side effects from taking statins			1
it said this would be ‘ challenging ’ given the vast numbers of patients involved , but ‘ necessary ’ in light of the concerns			0
professor @entity0 is understood to want to refute previous inaccurate claims that as many as one in five patients suffered side effects			1
one of the main worries surrounding statins is that too little is known about the risks , as drug companies fail to publish data			0
dr @entity161 , @entity162 mp for @entity163 and chairman of the @entity166 health select committee , said : ‘ i ’m concerned there may be side effects that have not been reported			1
drug manufacturers should release all their trial data on statins so they are available for scrutiny			0
’ @entity172 , professor of public health at @entity10 , said : ‘ we know these drugs have side effects but we do not know if these have been assessed properly by the drug companies			1
’ last july , @entity23 rationing body @entity177 said statins should be prescribed to 17million adults , nearly 40 per cent of the population			0
its guidance said @entity24 should offer them to anyone deemed to have a 10 per cent risk of suffering a stroke or heart attack in a decade .			0

sir @entity0 is to lead research into the mass prescription of statins
@entity192 has previously carried out studies showing the drugs ' benefits
but now he has acknowledged research did not investigate all side effects
professor and colleagues will review patient records to see how many have suffered ' adverse ' effects
