' the exact volume involved is impossible to calculate but was clearly substantial			0
you were the organiser and controller			0
' you played a leading part in the recruiting of others and were unquestionably involved in the buying and selling in the expectation of substantial gain			2
by 2004 many thousands of pounds were being made			0
' the commercial dealing of drugs destroys the lives of individuals and blights the communities in which they live which is why those who supply the drugs can expect to receive substantial sentences			0
you were the lead player in this conspiracy			0
