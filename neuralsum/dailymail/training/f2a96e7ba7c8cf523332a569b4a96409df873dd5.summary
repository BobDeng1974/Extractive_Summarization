by @entity0 published : 20:05 est , 3 december 2013 @entity2 : 06:42 est , 4 december 2013 millions of elderly people could be denied vital care under a @entity7 shake - up of the funding system , a leading charity has warned			1
there are fears older patients too frail to get out of bed by themselves will be denied home help on the state because they are not deemed dependent enough			1
age @entity15 also warns that further cuts to the social care budget will lead to many more elderly having to rely on ‘ flying ’ 15 - minute home visits			1
warning : elderly people could be denied vital care under a @entity7 shake - up , @entity15 has warned recently it emerged that older people were having to choose between a carer making them a cup of tea or helping them to the toilet because visits were so ‘ disgracefully ’ short			1
ministers are currently drawing up plans for a national system to decide how much state - funded care is given to each older person based on their needs and assets			1
at present , the funding is decided by individual councils - but this has been widely condemned as unfair and has led to many elderly people selling their homes to pay for care			1
the @entity44 has just finished consulting on its new system and the first draft of plans are likely to be published next may			0
opposing : care and support minister @entity50 , left , said the government 's current system sees people ' exhaust their savings ' , while age @entity15 's @entity56 , right , worries the new system will be inadequate but in a report today , @entity15 says it is ‘ deeply worried ’ that the government will set the bar ‘ too high ’			1
under the system expected to be brought in , the state would only pay for care for the elderly and disabled with ‘ critical ’ or ‘ substantial ’ needs - who need help with eating , drinking and most other daily tasks			2
those only deemed to have moderate needs - who have assistance getting out of bed and washing - would have to pay themselves			0
the charity adds : ‘ if this happens too many older people will remain shut out of the system , unable to access the help they need			0
it also says that even if the elderly are deemed eligible for state - funded care , it is often ‘ inadequate ’ due to severe cuts to the budget			2
recently it emerged that more than half of councils are only granting elderly and disabled 15 minute carer visits			2
home help : under the system expected to be brought in , the state would only pay for care for the elderly and disabled with ' critical ' or ' substantial ' needs the @entity96 charity - which compiled the data - said such ‘ disgracefully ’ short visits meant vulnerable patients were forced to choose between having a cup of tea and going to the toilet			1
@entity56 , charity director at @entity15 , said : ‘ the government deserves credit for bringing forward long overdue reforms to the social care system that could make a real difference if properly implemented , but we are worried that the social care ‘ coat ’ being designed for 2016 is being cut to the inadequate ‘ cloth ’ that the @entity110 is allocating			1
‘ a great new system on paper is pointless unless there is sufficient funding in place			0
' @entity119 - @entity118 , of the @entity120 , said : ‘ patients who cant get out of bed by themselves in the morning wont qualify for the cap			0
‘ that ’s definitely true			0
we ’re lobbying at the moment to put a number of concerns to the government			0
‘ most people really are n’t aware that their care is n’t free			0
they assume its like the @entity132 , it will come as a shock			0
’ the national system is likely to be similar to that used in many councils where the elderly or adults with learning disabilities deemed dependent enough would pay £ 72,000 of their care annually , and the state pays for the rest			2
but these rules would only apply to those whose needs are deemed ‘ critical ’ or ‘ substantial ’ , everyone else will have to pay for most of the care themselves			0
but @entity148 and support minister @entity50 said : ‘ we want to create a fairer society , that ’s why we are putting an end to the current system which sees people exhausting almost all their savings or selling their homes in a time of crisis to pay for care			2

millions of elderly people could be denied home help , @entity15 warns
more *pensioners* may have to rely on ' flying ' 15 - minute home visits
ministers are currently drawing up plans for new national care system
