this chilling @entity1 footage shows a jilted lover stalking his ex-fianc√©e and her new boyfriend moments before slashing their throats because she had refused to marry him			1
@entity7 , 26 , knifed 17 - year - old @entity8 and @entity9 , 22 , in broad daylight after ms @entity8 ' dishonoured him ' by fleeing from their arranged marriage			1
ms @entity8 and mr @entity9 had left their homes in @entity15 , @entity16 nine days earlier so the teenager did not have to go through with the forced marriage			1
but @entity7 managed to track the couple down in @entity20 , where he carried out the so - called ' honour ' attack in front of horrified shoppers on a sunday afternoon			1
@entity7 then slit ms @entity8 's throat while holding her from behind , before stabbing mr @entity9 through the neck with the same knife			1
he then repeatedly screamed ' my wife , my wife ' , as the weapon was prised from his hands by one of the victims			2
the defendant , from @entity57 , @entity58 , has now been jailed at @entity59 for 23 years after being found guilty of two charges of attempted murder			1
@entity7 was also convicted of unlawfully wounding a 15 - year - old boy who was with the couple and eventually managed to disarm him			1
the teenager was left with a badly - cut arm			2
sentencing , high court judge mr justice @entity66 said : ' the attack was intended by mr @entity7 to be a cold - blooded murder , committed to prevent @entity8 from marrying anyone else			1
' he grabbed hold of @entity8 round the neck and while holding her from behind he slit her throat from one side to the other with a knife			2
' he stabbed @entity9 through the neck with the same knife , pushing the knife right through his neck from front to back			2
' the jury had heard ms @entity8 's family and @entity7 were originally from @entity83 , a small island off the west coast of @entity85			1
they had moved to @entity87 in 2009			0
@entity7 , from @entity57 , @entity58 , has now been jailed for 23 years after being found guilty of two charges of attempted murder in 2012 , the two families agreed that ms @entity8 would marry @entity7 after she turned 18			1
but ms @entity8 did not want to go through with the marriage			1
instead , she planned to marry mr @entity9 and left home with him on january 10			1
the defence counsel said that , after discovering she had fled , @entity7 was ' disturbed , troubled and depressed '			1
but he soon received a tip off about the couple 's location from a family friend			2
he then ' acted on impulse ' in carrying out the frenzied attack , the court was told			0
prosecutors said @entity7 had tried to kill the pair because he considered they had ' dishonoured him '			2
but @entity7 had said he carried out the attack because his ' mind was n't working ' and he was a victim of black magic			1
during the eight - week trial the jury watched footage from body cameras worn by the officers which captured the aftermath of the attack			2
sentencing , mr justice @entity66 told the court that , if it were not for the quick actions of police , both victims could have died			0
he said : ' fortunately the police were on the scene very quickly and took appropriate steps to stem the two victims ' bleeding , which was considerable			0
' they cared for the wounded until an ambulance arrived to take them to hospital			0
it may well be that the prompt police action saved the lives of these two young people			0
' he added : ' both the jury and i were impressed with the efficient , calm and highly professional way in which the police carried out their duty			0
' because the police were carrying cameras , which recorded what was happening , we saw some very shocking scenes but it brought home to us the true nature of these events			0
' earlier this week , ms @entity8 's father , @entity149 , 40 , from @entity15 was found guilty of common assault against his daughter and given a 12 - month conditional discharge			1
he was found not guilty of false imprisonment , along with her mother @entity154 , 42			2
@entity149 was originally charged with conspiracy to murder his daughter and served 100 days on remand in custody before that allegation was dropped			2
during the attack , @entity7 slit ms @entity8 's throat while holding her from behind , before stabbing mr @entity9 through the neck with the same knife ( pictured ) three of ms @entity8 's uncles @entity164 , 31 , @entity165 , 25 , and @entity166 , 37 , and a cousin @entity167 , 18 , all from @entity15 were also cleared of kidnapping charges			1
ms @entity169 and mr @entity9 have since married and are living at a secret address , due to threats from other members of the family , the court was told			1
mr @entity66 said : ' the background was that @entity177 was engaged to be married to @entity8 , which was arranged by her parents and i 'm satisfied @entity8 never willingly agreed to it			1
' she never told @entity7 she wanted to marry him although she agreed to the engagement because she felt she had no option but to go along with her parents ' wishes until she was old enough to be able to marry @entity186 without their consent			1
' on january 10 this year , @entity8 ran away with @entity188 , intending to marry him and not @entity42			1
' when @entity7 discovered @entity8 was n't going to marry him he became very upset			1
' i accept it may be that he was in love with her and developed a fixation about her , but i do n't believe he ever had grounds for believing @entity8 was in love with him			2
' mr @entity7 said in evidence he had wanted to marry @entity8 since she was 11 , although they did n't meet until she was 16 after they became engaged			1
' he continued : ' after @entity188 and @entity8 were seen out on the street ( in @entity20 ) by a family friend on january 19 , he informed @entity199 he had seen @entity8			1
' after being given that information @entity7 went off to purchase a knife and i 'm satisfied the reason for that was to use it to kill @entity8			1
' i ca n't be sure he was intending to kill @entity188 , who he may not have realised was with her at the time			0
' he went around the streets looking for @entity8 so he could kill her			2
immediately after the attack @entity7 was repeating ' my wife , my wife '			1
the couple had left their homes in @entity15 , @entity16 to live in @entity20 in january this year , so ms @entity8 would not have to marry @entity42 the pair left their homes just nine days before the brutal attack			1
they are now living at a secret address ' the defendant told the police he lost his mind , because he believed that a curse had been put on him			0
' @entity7 was sentenced to 23 years in prison for the attempted murders , as well as three years for wounding with intent , which will run concurrently			1
the judge said he was not imposing a life sentence , because of @entity7 's previously good character			1
although they have been left permanently scarred from their injuries , the judge also said it was believed that the victims had not suffered ' serious long term harm '			0
he added : ' that 's not to underestimate the ordeal they 've gone through and the considerable difficulties they still have			0
' it 's hoped they 'll make a good long term recovery			0
' they 've had to move away from family , friends and jobs because they 're under threat of reprisals from other people - which is not attributable to mr @entity7			2
' i very much hope those threats will now cease			0
' he said that the mitigating factors were the defendant 's good character and the fact he was suffering from an ' adjustment disorder with prolonged depressive reaction '			0
@entity7 's defence counsel , @entity260 said that , although @entity42 was not suffering from a ' classified mental illness ' , the trigger for the offending was when @entity8 eloped			1
mr @entity264 said : ' it made him feel low and he felt very hurt			0
he had nightmares , he was seeing ghosts			0
' he got a tip off about where they were and acted on impulse			0
he feels bad about the effect of his actions and many times he 's cried about it			0
' he 's not wired the same as other people because in his family there 's an unfortunate pattern of suicide ; both his father and paternal grandfather killed themselves			0
' in the defendant 's mind he 'd been rejected without a reason			0
his feelings for @entity8 remained strong , right up until the day of this attack			2
' police at the scene of the crime shortly after the attack			0
the judge praised officers for their quick actions in dealing with the attempted murders the officers were carrying cameras , which recorded what was happening			0
the judge said the footage brought home ' the true nature of these events ' after the case , detective inspector @entity304 from @entity58 police 's serious crime team , said : ' these were dreadful crimes , and could easily have caused the deaths of two young people who had harmed no - one			2
' crimes like these are very rare , and are sometimes called honour based violence			0
however , this has nothing to do with culture or religion , this is simple criminality			0
' @entity320 took this case extremely seriously and carried out a thorough investigation to put those responsible before the courts			0
' he added : ' during our initial enquiries this case was quickly identified as being one of honour based violence and concerns regarding a possible forced marriage			0
' this case demonstrates that we take crimes of this nature incredibly seriously and we hope it gives potential victims the confidence to report it to the police or other agencies			0
' anyone who fears they may be subjected to honour based violence or have concerns about someone else should contact us at the earliest opportunity			0
there are a range of criminal and civil powers we and partner agencies can put in place to keep you safe			0
