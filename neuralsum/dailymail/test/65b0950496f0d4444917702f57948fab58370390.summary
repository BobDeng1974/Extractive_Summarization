forget stumbling into the kitchen in the small hours and waiting for milk to heat up with a screaming baby on your arm			0
a self - warming bottle that heats up in 60 seconds is among the latest gizmos designed to make new mums ' lives easier			1
while muslin squares and cotton wool have been go - to products for mums for generations , gadgets on the market in 2015 include a machine that makes ' shushing ' sounds to ' break the cycle of crying ' and biodegradable nappies which do n't clog up landfill			1
shoppers in @entity33 , @entity34 , have reported seeing @entity24 buying the nappies , which are made of natural fibres and are popular in @entity37			1
while re-usable and biodegradable nappies are easier on the planet and will no doubt get prince @entity43 ' seal of approval there is also a wealth of products to make parenthood easier - whether you 're royal or not			1
@entity49 's self - warming baby bottle promises to gently warm a baby 's feed to the natural temperature of breast milk in just 60 seconds , meaning there 's no need for @entity56 to even get out of bed when helping with night - time feeds			1
and if they 're having trouble settling the baby and need to resort to the pushchair the royal couple can pace around the grounds of @entity65 in safety thanks to @entity67 flashing ladybirds , which clip on to the pushchair 's chassis and come with white forward facing and red rear facing flashing lights - just like a car			1
there 's no need to get cold hands while trying to get the baby to sleep either : mummy mitts attach to the handle bars of the pushchair , meaning you can take your hands out while the mittens remain attached			0
headlights for the pushchair and a baby ' shusher ' are among the latest gadgets for mums ... ... or why not try mittens that attached to the pushchair or a giraffe to rock the crib ? @entity93 's spout protector is also among the list of products you never knew you needed , stopping baby touching hot bath taps and protecting against bumps , with heat spots that change colour to indicate temperature			2
when it comes to bedtime the @entity104 puts an end to pacing round the living room for hours on end : with rhymic ' shush ' sounds the device can be programmed to make 15 minutes or 30 minutes of continuous shushing			0
and if that does n't work patent - pending @entity112 the giraffe attaches to car seat , cribs and baby bouncers to rock the baby for up to 30 minutes - just enough time to get your nails done			2
but if baby is n't sleeping because they 're poorly look no further than the @entity122 , a non-spill medicine spoon which promises to administer medicine without spilling it first			0
a self - warming bottle and a spout protector are other gadgets on offer the @entity122 is designed to look like a caterpillar and administer medicine without spilling it ' there 's a mind - boggling array of infant devices on the market , but just because something exists does n't mean that anyone actually needs it , ' @entity133 , ceo of parenting website @entity134 , told @entity144			1
' for first time parents , it 's almost impossible to predict which baby products will turn out to be essentials and which will gather dust in the cupboard			0
feeding : muslin squares sleeping : moses basket clothing : @entity154 , scratch mittens medicine : gripe water , @entity158 toys : @entity160 ' one family will find that a multi-purpose travel system fits in perfectly with their needs ; another may realise that all they need for transport is a sling			0
' and what would sister @entity169 , @entity173 's profoundly practical chief midwife - or your @entity171 - have to say ? while there 's no doubt many of today 's modern gadgets can make life easy for new parents , when it comes to babies there are some things which have transcended time			0
muslin squares , scratch mittens and @entity154 still feature on ' must have ' hospital bag lists , and many new mums come home from hospital and place their bundles of joy in @entity193 baskets			0
' our users also find that talking to other parents - about what you do and do n't need to buy , how to budget , and the realities of day - to - day finances with an extra mouth to feed - is priceless , ' says @entity202 .			2

@entity24 is said to have bought biodegradable nappies in @entity34
