eight of @entity2 's starting line - up were signed by @entity3 , confirmation of the impact he 's had in little over two years at @entity6			1
the three he inherited were n't too shabby either ; @entity8 ( homegrown ) , @entity10 ( signed by @entity11 ) and @entity12 ( @entity13 ) the match against @entity15 was @entity3 ' first as a manager , and @entity2 's first in five years more people at @entity6 than in whole of @entity19 there were a few empty seats at @entity6 but the 43,307 crowd was still larger than the entire population of @entity19 , the north - eastern @entity25 town that ludogorets come from			1
that is estimated at around 38,000			0
there were more than 43,000 people at @entity6 , more than the entire population of @entity19 @entity12 's first match as vice-captain @entity12 led by example in his first outing since being named the club 's official vice-captain to @entity8			1
it was n't the easiest evening for @entity2 but @entity12 showed incredible energy and always tried to make himself available for the man on the ball			2
he might not be another @entity8 , but he 'll be a good captain in years to come , possibly for @entity39 too			0
it was former @entity42 midfielder @entity12 's first game as @entity2 's vice-captain is @entity44 the new @entity45 ? early days yet but @entity3 will be hoping @entity44 is n't this year 's @entity45			1
fine player and all that but so far he just seems a bit overawed			0
he scuffed a great chance to put @entity2 ahead , at which point the camera rather unkindly panned to the injured @entity51 , sitting in the stands			2
@entity2 signed @entity44 for Â£ 23million from @entity53 but he has failed to impress thus far @entity8 sets new milestone at 34 years , 109 days , @entity8 became the sixth - oldest @entity2 player in @entity56 , following @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61			0
he was a player @entity3 felt he could n't leave out despite the ageing skipper having faced @entity63 72 hours earlier			0
@entity8 became the sixth - oldest @entity2 player to play for the club in @entity56 stadium announcer sets the scene the stadium announcer tried to capture the emotion of @entity2 's @entity71 return by playing get back by a local group called @entity73			1
given they have tricky trips to @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78 to follow and the possibility of @entity80 , perhaps @entity81 would have been more appropriate			0
@entity2 fans watched their first @entity71 match at @entity6 since 2009 when they lost to @entity84 @entity10 reputation growing @entity10 found out his reputation comes before him these days			1
@entity87 stuck to him like glue and it was an excellent little tussle with @entity90 showing enough tenacity and low centre of gravity to ensure he did a lot better than many @entity97 defenders @entity87 stuck to 19 - year - old sensation @entity10 like glue throughout the match video we showed great resilience			2

@entity2 beat @entity15 in @entity71 opener
@entity2 's first in @entity71 match since @entity84 in 2009
more people at @entity6 than whole of @entity19
@entity10 realises his reputation can be *hindrance*
