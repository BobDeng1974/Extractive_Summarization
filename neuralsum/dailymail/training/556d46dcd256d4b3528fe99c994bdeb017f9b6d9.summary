it will be the biggest test yet of @entity2 ’s much - praised fashion sense , as she will need up to 30 different outfits , including one for a trek to the jungle			1
the @entity26 is believed to be lending her several pieces of jewellery including , possibly , one of her favourite tiaras			0

the couple have been told to expect a colourful welcome – complete with chanting warriors – followed by a drive to the capital in an open - topped vehicle decked in fresh flowers			0
paradise : the royal couple will take in @entity35 , a @entity135 island located midway between @entity136 and @entity137 which is one of the most remote inhabited places on the globe the royal treatment : the couple will be carried from a plane in a garlanded canoe just like the @entity26 and @entity145 were during their visit to @entity35 in 1982 animal watching : @entity17 and @entity2 will get up close and personal with wild orangutans in @entity30 getting back to nature : the @entity1 and @entity2 will also head deep into the jungle in the @entity118 in @entity30 another traditional state dinner also beckons , although this one takes the form of an outdoor island feast with meats cooked in underground barbecues			1
and then , just when the endless rounds of smiles and handshakes may have got a little too much , they will be whisked off to paradise – in a traditional war canoe			0
the five - star @entity19 private @entity82 is known as one of the @entity16 ’s ‘ best kept secrets ’			2
it says it offers ‘ decadent king - sized beds , some of the best food on the planet , crystal clear water teeming with life , a relaxing massage over the water [ and ] “ real ” local people who wait on you hand and foot … in one of the wildest places left on earth			0
’ the 37 - acre island , discovered by @entity183 in the 19th century , was once a coconut plantation owned by @entity186 traders			0
in the 1970s it was bought by @entity189 interior designer @entity188 and his late partner @entity190 , who turned the overgrown island into a luxury five star resort			0
poignant : the couple will be given the chance to view an orchid named after @entity17 's late , mother , @entity196 , @entity196 , which she never got to see stop off : on september 16 they will make their way to the @entity31 , which despite consisting of nearly 1,000 islands across 11,000 square miles , have a population of little over half a million it is currently up for sale for just over £ 7.5million			1
the royal couple are believed to be staying there as guests of the @entity31 government , which is anxious to promote tourism in the area			1
it is expected they will stay in a £ 300 - a - night hand - thatched bungalow favoured by honeymooners which has been built over the crystalline waters of the @entity217 and boasts a ‘ majestic ’ king - sized bed carved out of bamboo			0
each of the resort ’s eight bungalows has a personal attendant who can be summoned with a tap of a tribal drum			0
aides confirmed yesterday that the couple hope to do a little snorkelling before retiring to bed for an early start to @entity35 the following morning			1
the @entity26 last visited the island in 1982 when she was carried ashore with prince @entity145 from @entity234 in a canoe			2
this time @entity17 and @entity2 will arrive by plane but the locals are still determined to continue the custom			2
‘ we have really have no idea what to expect , ’ their private secretary admitted yesterday			0
the couple will be given a tour of the ten mile square island , including the coconut tree that was planted by the @entity26 on her last visit			2
but it will be rather less luxurious than their previous stop			0
the island is plagued by ants and large rats , and the infrastructure is so limited that the couple will stay in only the most basic of hotels .			0

couple will take in @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , the @entity31 and tiny @entity16 realm of @entity35
they are set to see wild orangutans , have orchid named after each of them and face challenge of being carried in garlanded canoe
@entity2 to take personal hairdresser with her on tour to ensure she is picture perfect at all times
