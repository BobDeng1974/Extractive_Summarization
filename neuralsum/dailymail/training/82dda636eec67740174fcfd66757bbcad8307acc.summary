the woman behind everyone 's favorite cookie : @entity3 , founder of the @entity5 restaurant in @entity6 , @entity7 , created the chocolate - chip cookie in 1938 there are two popular stories about how the chocolate - chip cookie was invented by @entity3 in 1938			1
one theory is that @entity3 , the co-owner of @entity6 , @entity7 ' @entity5 restaurant , accidentally spilled a bag of chocolate morsels into a batch of cookie dough that was being prepared in a mixer			1
the other is that @entity3 added chopped up bits of a chocolate candy bar when she ran out of nuts			1
both of those theories were disproved by @entity25 in her recently - published book about the sweet - treat 's origin : ' the @entity30 book '			0
in her research for the book , @entity31 tracked down a rare interview given by @entity3 in 1974 , just three years before the cookie inventor died			1
in the interview , @entity3 explains that she was trying to improve a cookie recipe they had been serving at her restaurant			1
' we had been serving a thin butterscotch nut cookie with ice cream			0
everybody seemed to love it , but i was trying to give them something different , ' @entity3 explained			2
adding chocolate chips made the cookies the new star of the dessert and they became an instant hit across the country			1
unlike the fame - seeking celebrity chefs of today , @entity3 did n't care to use her recipe to get her places			2
instead , she sold the recipe to @entity58 nearly 75 years ago this week			2
the chocolate company then went on to start mass - producing chocolate chips			1
touch of genius : @entity3 gave an interview in 1974 , saying she was trying to improve a @entity65 cookie when she created the world 's first batch of chocolate - chip cookies the best thing since sliced bread : the cookies became an instant hit at @entity3 's @entity5 restaurant , and soon swept the country when @entity58 began mass - producing chocolate chips how - to : soon after inventing the cookies , @entity3 sold the rights to her recipe to @entity58 and they still publish her instructions on the back of their chocolate - chip bags chocolate chips remain one of the few food items specifically created for use in a recipe			1
they also printed @entity3 's original @entity87 recipe on the back of the chocolate - chip packaging			1
the recipe is still on the back of the bag today and remains the most frequently made back - of - the - package recipe			0
while it may seem a shame that @entity58 profited from her invention , signing over her recipe proved fruitful in the end since it drove traffic to her restaurant and helped turn her cookbook ' @entity104 ' into a best - seller			2
eventually @entity3 and her husband @entity106 retired from running the restaurant , passing the popular eatery on to new owners			0
@entity3 passed away in 1977 , and was quickly followed in death by the @entity5 restaurant itself			1
it burnt down on @entity113 1985			0
