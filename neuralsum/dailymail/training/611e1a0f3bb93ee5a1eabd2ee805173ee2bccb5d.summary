it is a country which has been left on its knees , fuelling anger and resentment among its people			1
almost nobody in @entity6 has been left untouched by the devastating economic crisis			1
but it is the country 's migrants who now appear to have become the biggest victims of this troubling period in @entity6 history			2
@entity20 , a 32 - year - old @entity21 migrant , shows scars on his back following an attack against him injured : mr @entity20 says he was attacked by a group of men holding @entity6 flags and left with the deep wounds on his back , throat and neck in august many face daily racist attacks , police apathy and a system that punishes them rather than their assailants			1
@entity20 , a 32 - year - old @entity21 migrant who fled conflict in his country in hope of a better life in @entity42 - has been left fearing for his life			1
in august , he and a friend were walking in @entity45 when black - shirted men on motorcycles holding @entity6 flags came up and knocked him unconscious with a blow to the head , he said			1
when he came to , he was covered in blood			2
only later would he realise that his attackers , whom he says were likely tied to the far - right @entity52 , had left large gashes resembling an ' x ' across his back			1
' i do n't have the right papers , so i ca n't go anywhere to ask for help , ' @entity20 said			1
' i ca n't sleep			2
i 'm scared , maybe they will follow me , and my life is in danger now			0
tapping into resentment towards illegal immigrants , @entity52 emerged from obscurity to enter parliament this year pledging to kick all immigrants out			1
the fast - rising party , which has been linked to racist attacks , denies it is neo-nazi			1
@entity72 : only later did he realise his attackers , which he says were likely tied to the far - right @entity52 , had left large gashes resembling an ' x ' across his back divided country : mr @entity20 shows a scar on his neck			1
many migrants face daily racist attacks , police apathy and a system that punishes them rather than their assailants in the latest criticism of @entity6 's handling of migrants , the @entity88 on migrants ' rights condemned @entity6 for doing little to curb rising racist attacks			1
much of the violence went unreported because victims were afraid of deportation if they went to the police , who were sometimes involved in the attacks , @entity93 said			1
a major gateway for @entity102 and @entity103 immigrants trying to enter @entity42 through its porous borders , @entity6 has long struggled with illegal immigration			0
in the last few years , the problem has exploded into a full - blown crisis as @entity6 sank into a deep recession , leaving one in four jobless and hardening attitudes towards migrants who were blamed for a rise in crime			1
@entity114 equipped at the best of times to deal with the hordes of immigrants crossing its border with @entity119 or arriving in plastic boats , @entity6 now finds itself grappling with a rising number of migrants when it can barely keep itself afloat			0
stepped - up border patrols this year have stemmed the flow only slightly - in the first 10 months of the year , over 70,000 illegal migrants were arrested for crossing into @entity6 , down from about 82,000 in that period last year			1
many often find shocking conditions at detention centres with food shortages , no hot water or heating and open hostility from @entity6 embittered by years of austerity , @entity93 and other rights groups say			0
@entity135 immigrant @entity134 is another victim			0
he says demanding his unpaid wages in @entity6 came at a heavy price ; 18 hours chained and beaten by his boss , a stint in jail and orders to leave the country he calls home			0
shocking : the economic crisis has seen riots on the streets of @entity6			0
in this picture , a riot policeman is on fire from a petrol bomb thrown by protesters one of hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants who toil in @entity6 's black labour market , @entity134 had just finished cleaning the bakery where he worked one november morning on the island of @entity156 when he sparked his boss 's fury			0
the baker and two others fastened an 8 - metre long metal chain around @entity134 's neck with a lock and dragged him to a stable , he said , where another man joined them			1
there they tied him to a chair , tightened the noose and punched him while he drifted in and out of consciousness , he said			0
the men drank beer - which they also forced into @entity134 's mouth - and taunted him for being a @entity175 , he said			1
' they dragged me around like a dog , ' said @entity134 , recounting the attack from a mattress on the floor of his dingy apartment tucked away amid @entity156 's low - roofed houses and tavernas			1
' i thought this was the end for me			0
i kept fainting , and every time i fainted they would hit me with rods to wake me up			0
' after 18 hours , @entity134 managed to escape when his captors left to reopen the bakery			2
but his nightmare was not over			0
found at dawn under a tree with the heavy chain still around his neck and his face swollen beyond recognition , @entity134 was initially taken to a hospital and given first aid			2
but police later whisked him away to detain him on the charge that he lacked documents to live in @entity6 - though he says he complained he could barely walk and was in pain			1
fighting : protestors clash with riot police during an anti-austerity protest ' everyone could see i was suffering			2
i could n't even see , and i could n't eat , ' says @entity134 , 29			0
a month later he has a neck brace , an arm bandage and can only eat semi-solid food			0
' i thought i would die			0
the problem was n't that i did n't have papers ; the problem was that i had been beaten			0
' calling his ordeal one of ' striking brutality ' , the @entity216 high commissioner for refugees said his case followed a pattern in which migrants are ' immediately arrested with the view to be deported ' when they go to police to report an attack			1
after an outcry over the case - including condemnation by the @entity135 embassy and a protest by other @entity135 - @entity6 's public order minister on tuesday said @entity134 would not be deported due to ' humanitarian reasons '			2
but rights groups said it was not clear how long he would be allowed to stay			0
@entity134 says he spent four days in two detention centres and was given documents telling him to leave @entity6 in 30 days , while his boss was released after three days pending trial			0
the baker , a former deputy mayor in @entity156 , admitted to beating @entity134 - but not brutally - and accuses him of stealing 13,000 euros that @entity134 says is his money , police said			1
the other men @entity134 accused were charged but are free pending trial since police failed to arrest them in the required 24 - hour window after the crime			1
' there was a phone in prison , and when i called other people , they told me my boss had already been released , ' he said			0
' they hit me , robbed me and then everyone was out of jail except me			0
' indeed , the lack of any convictions in @entity6 over racist attacks has allowed migrants to be targeted with impunity , said @entity262 , head of @entity263 in @entity6			1
' the state should apologise to a man found under a tree in chains			0
we treated him like a dog - that 's bad enough , ' @entity262 said , attacking the move to detain @entity134 after his ordeal			2
' if we do n't convict any of these people nothing will change			0
then everyone feels that they can get away with it			0
' police officials defended their actions by saying @entity134 was pulled out of hospital only after they were given the go - ahead by doctors and that @entity6 law required the detention of illegal immigrants			1
a @entity6 police spokesman declined to comment beyond the statement by the minister saying @entity134 's deportation had been suspended			2
@entity134 and others in the @entity135 community say his injuries were serious enough for him to be sent back to hospital for a week after his four days in detention were over			2
two @entity6 immigration lawyers said @entity134 was lucky to be given 30 days to leave - many others are often given just seven days to get out of @entity6			2
@entity6 officials say the root of the problem with the country 's migrants is the so - called @entity304 treaty , which deems asylum seekers to be the responsibility of the country where they entered @entity42 and thus puts a heavier burden on border states like @entity6			2
@entity6 governments have repeatedly asked for the treaty to be repealed , to no avail , and the @entity216 's @entity93 also said @entity42 needed to do more to help @entity6 with the flow of migrants .			0
