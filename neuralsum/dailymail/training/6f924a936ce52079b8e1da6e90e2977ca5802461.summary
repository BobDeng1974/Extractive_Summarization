the @entity0 have moved in a two - point lead over @entity2 in the first of a series of polls the @entity6 have moved into a two - point lead over @entity2 following a fall in support for @entity10 , according to the first in a series of polls for the @entity14			1
the @entity16 survey reveals that the @entity0 are up three points in a month – on 34 per cent to @entity2 ’s 32 – while @entity10 has slipped four points to 13 per cent , its lowest ebb since early last year			1
the poll confirms that with fewer than 75 days to go until the most unpredictable general election for generations , @entity21 has become a significant drag on @entity2 ’s fortunes			1
more than 60 per cent of voters do not believe he would make a good prime minister and one in four say they would like to vote @entity2 but are put off by the party ’s leader			1
even among those saying they plan to vote @entity2 , a quarter brand mr @entity21 a turn - off , suggesting a significant chunk of his party ’s support could be soft – from swing voters – and may decline by polling day			1
there is also growing concern around the country at the prospect of a @entity2 government being propped up by the resurgent @entity43 if mr @entity21 falls short of a majority			1
more than half of voters – 55 per cent – say the @entity47 should be barred from making decisions on laws that do not have an impact on @entity51 if it becomes part of a coalition government			1
of the minor parties , the @entity54 are faring best			2
their share of voters ’ support has risen to 8 per cent – their highest showing with the pollster since 2010 – bringing them level with the @entity63			2
though the @entity6 have moved ahead of @entity2 , the poll is not all good news for mr @entity66			1
voters are almost twice as likely to say that it is time for a change of government – 60 per cent – than say @entity71 should stay the course with the current leadership , an option favoured by 34 per cent			1
@entity75 , chairman of @entity16 , said the election ‘ really is too close to call ’ and it appeared ‘ unlikely ’ that any party could command a majority			2
‘ @entity71 has not had two successive hung parliaments for more than 100 years			1
our first - past - the - post electoral system was designed for stability			2
that is fine when you have a few strong parties , but as the combined popularity of the main parties has declined so the smaller ones have flourished			2
@entity99 should be barred from influencing laws that affect only the rest of the @entity71 if they enter a coalition government at @entity104 , a majority of voters believe			1
@entity16 found more than half of @entity71 – 57 per cent – concede that the @entity47 should be able to join a @entity71 - wide coalition in the event of a hung parliament			1
but 55 per cent say it should be not be allowed to make decisions on laws that do not have an impact on @entity51			1
forecasts suggest the party is on course to hold the balance of power at @entity104 , winning 30 or more commons constituencies , 24 more than it currently holds			2
@entity51 ’s first minister @entity117 has indicated she would be prepared to put @entity21 in @entity118 , doing a deal with @entity2 even if it has fewer seats than the conservatives			1
but in return the @entity47 will demand an end to the austerity which has put the economy back on its feet and insist on a £ 180 billion spending spree			1
@entity66 has said a @entity2 - @entity47 pact could break up and bankrupt @entity71			1
‘ twenty years ago , @entity2 ’s vote share under @entity130 reached peaks as high as 60 per cent , whereas the @entity0 and @entity2 can now manage only a little more than that combined			1
’ mr @entity75 added : ‘ the political landscape has changed , probably permanently			0
‘ a system built for certainty is delivering the precise opposite			0
@entity16 will be tracking voter opinion across the country throughout the coming campaign and afterwards – for not only is the election outcome hard to predict , but the uncertainty is likely to continue for weeks , months and possibly years to come			0
’ the latest weekly poll for @entity143 put @entity10 on 11 per cent , a record low since the peer began national polling last may , though it gave @entity2 a four - point lead , with 36 per cent to the @entity0 ’ 32 per cent			1
@entity148 had the two main parties level pegging – with 32 per cent each – and @entity10 on 15 per cent			1
in his latest election campaign speech , mr @entity66 yesterday stepped up his pitch for the ‘ grey vote ’ as he explained his commitment to protect a raft of universal benefits if he wins a second term			0
the prime minister said all pensioners would continue to receive the winter fuel allowance , free bus passes , tv licences for over- 75s , and free prescriptions and eye tests as long as he is in office			0
despite criticism that the elderly have been unfairly shielded from cuts targeted at working - age benefit claimants , mr @entity66 insisted the younger generation shared his priorities			0
speaking in @entity171 , he said : ‘ older people need us			0
they have done so much for us – this is the least we can do for them			0
‘ and i ’ll tell you what – the younger generation agree			0
like me , [ they ] want nothing more than for the older generation to be given the dignity and security they deserve			0
’ he insisted @entity2 ’s plans to means - test benefits for pensioners would save only a ‘ paltry ’ 4 per cent of their costs			1
by @entity75 , chairman of @entity16 it may be a cliché , but the election on may 7th really is too close to call			0
the most plausible outcomes are a minority government led by either @entity66 or @entity21 , or another coalition which could include the @entity63 , @entity47 , @entity86 parties and possibly even @entity10 or the @entity54			1
the one unlikely outcome at this stage appears to be a majority for any party			0
this is not supposed to happen			0
@entity71 has not had two successive hung parliaments for more than 100 years			2
our first - past - the - post electoral system was designed for stability			0
that is fine when you have a few strong parties , but as the combined popularity of the main parties has declined so the smaller ones have flourished			0
twenty years ago @entity2 ’s vote share under @entity130 reached peaks as high as 60 % , whereas the @entity0 and @entity2 can now manage only a little more than that combined			2
the political landscape has changed , probably permanently			0
a system built for certainty is delivering the precise opposite			0
in the long term , this makes constitutional change look almost certain			0
nothing is off the table , including @entity224 reform , online voting and giving 16 - and 17 - year - olds the vote			2
just four years after the referendum on @entity230 , we may even see proportional representation for general elections back on the cards			0
in the shorter term , it looks increasingly likely that @entity2 will have more seats than the conservatives in may but get fewer votes			2
today sees the launch of our new poll series for the @entity14 , and it reveals a nation anxious for political change but just as nervous about @entity21 as prime minister			2
if , as today ’s voting intention poll finds , @entity2 ends up two percentage points behind the @entity0 nationally , the electorate will have reluctantly thrust mr @entity21 into the top job with a pitifully small and probably unsustainable mandate			1
that is why it is so important to be able to bring the very latest political insight and analysis to @entity14 readers			0
@entity16 will be tracking voter opinion across the country throughout the coming campaign and afterwards			0
for not only is the election outcome hard to predict , but the uncertainty is likely to continue for weeks , months and possibly years to come .			0
