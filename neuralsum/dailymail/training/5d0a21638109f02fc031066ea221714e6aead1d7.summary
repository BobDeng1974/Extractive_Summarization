@entity0 , 65 , says his life was saved by an ambulance driving over a pothole as it slowed his heart rate they are an everyday hazard which leave most of us cursing			1
but the pothole that punctuated @entity0 ’s journey may well have saved his life			2
the grandfather was on a stretcher in the back of an ambulance being taken to hospital after collapsing at home while exercising on a cross-trainer			2
he had suffered a suspected ventricular tachycardia attack – a potentially fatal heart rhythm			2
his heart rate soared to 190 beats per minute , causing crippling pains in his chest			1
the medical solution when he reached @entity24 would have been to give him an injection to stop his heart before restarting it with a shock			0
but , thanks to a poorly - maintained road on the five - mile trip from his home in @entity35 , @entity36 , mr @entity0 did n’t have to wait			1
the ambulance hit a pothole , throwing the retired operations manager up off his stretcher			0
when he landed , his heart had reset itself to a healthy 60bpm			0
his wife , @entity41 , called an ambulance when mr @entity0 ’s heart rate shot up during his exercise routine			1
‘ the paramedics gave me an injection and strapped me to an @entity48 machine , which showed my heart was going at 186 beats per minute , ’ said mr @entity0 , 65			1
‘ we raced along the roads at high speed , with a medic standing in the back , leaning over me			0
‘ all of a sudden , there was a massive bang as we smacked into a pothole and the whole ambulance jolted			2
everyone on board jumped and i was lifted off the stretcher , before falling back into place			0
‘ after a few seconds i readjusted myself , settled back down , and looked over at the monitor to see my heart rate had plummeted to 60bpm			1
the jolt that the dip in the road caused mr @entity0 's heart rate to drop dramatically while he was being rushed to hospital			1
he said he has complained about the state of his road for years but now does n't want the potholes to ever be filled in ‘ the paramedic looked at me in a state of disbelief , but nobody said anything because we were so focused on getting to hospital			0
’ when they arrived , mr @entity0 was still in pain and given morphine – and medics decided the jolt had saved him having to have the planned treatment			1
‘ i felt a bit of a fraud by the time i got to @entity87 , because my heart rhythm was normal , ’ he said			0
‘ i was told they would have carried out a procedure to stop the spasm in my heart , but driving over the pothole did the trick			0
’ potholes may ruin cars and be unsightly but in mr @entity0 's case it helped save his life mr @entity0 and his wife , a retired teacher , drive along the same road regularly and have previously cursed its bad state			1
he said the stretch of road , which has a mixture of 30mph and 60mph speed limits , has numerous potholes , some of which are 2ft wide and a couple of inches deep			0
mr @entity0 said : ‘ i ’d been cursing the council for months about the state of the roads because i spend my life dodging potholes , but now i never want them to fill in another pothole again			1
‘ i ca n’t say the pothole alone saved me – the wonderful paramedics and doctors did that – but bumping over it did make things easier			0
‘ without the appalling condition of @entity125 ’s roads i might not have had such an easy time			0
‘ i guess there are some potholes that ruin your car and others that save your life			0
’ the grandfather - of - three was told that what he suffered had created a form of electrical short circuit in his heart , possibly as a result of a heart attack 21 years ago			1
mr @entity0 , who spent three days in hospital , is now undergoing tests , and has been told to take it easy			1
but he says he feels well and is thanking his ‘ pot luck ’			0
a spokesman for @entity145 said : ‘ we can confirm we were carrying a patient to hospital with a heart condition when the ambulance hit a pothole			2
' the patient ’s heart rate subsequently fell			2

@entity0 , 65 , was exercising when heart rate rose to 190 beats per minute
his wife @entity41 called an ambulance after he developed pains in chest
on way to hospital , ambulance dramatically jolted after hitting a pothole
impact so great mr @entity0 's heart rate dropped to 60 beats per minute
mr @entity0 was later *diagnosed* with ventricular *arrhythmia* , which *occurs* when an electrical short circuit is created in the heart
@entity125 *spokesperson* said : ' we are really *pleased* to hear mr @entity0 is *recovering* well . '
