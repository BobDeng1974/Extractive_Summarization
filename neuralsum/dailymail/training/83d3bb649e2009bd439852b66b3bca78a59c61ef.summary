they greet you with a smile , serve you drinks and some seriously questionable food while taking care of all your little in - flight problems			2
but there 's a lot more to the average flight attendant than meets the eye			2
they only get paid when they plane doors are closed despite all the hard work at check in and helping to cram those oversize bags into the overhead lockers , flight attendants only officially clock on when the doors are closed			0
even if the flight is delayed or cancelled they will only be receiving a minimal expense allowance usually around £ 1 an hour			0
so bear that in mind the next time you feel like venting your fury on an attendant when you 're left waiting at the gate for a few extra minutes			0
they have some rather unflattering nicknames these include ' @entity44 ' for those badly - behaved infants whose parents do nothing to control and ' @entity48 ' for the walk down the cabin to check everybody 's seatbelts are fastened			1
however most disturbing of all is ' @entity53 ' for when an attendant just ca n't keep their gas in any longer and takes an innocent - looking stroll down the isle to distribute it evenly throughout the cabin			1
they still must be of a certain height and size in the golden years of the jet age sexism in the skies was taken for granted			0
attendants were always female and had to be lean , leggy and gorgeous			0
@entity68 notoriously specified attendants must be unmarried , a minimum of 5ft 2ins , weigh no more than 130 pounds and have no children			2
if that was n't outrageous enough they also had to retire at the age of 32			2
the golden years of airline travel , as portrayed in the film @entity73 ( pictured ) are long gone but flight attendants still need to be of a certain height and size albeit for safety reasons fortunately thanks to the women 's rights campaigners of the seventies those days are long gone but in the interests of safety flight attendants must still conform to height and weight restrictions			0
they need to be able to fit in the jump seats for starters and while they must be tall enough to reach the overhead head lockers , they ca n't be too tall otherwise they will bump their heads on the ceiling			2
according to one poster , apparently recruiting cabin crew in @entity95 , @entity93 requires air stewards to be aged between 20 and 28 , university educated and with a minimum height of 5 ft 3 inches			1
@entity100 hi - jinks we 're not necessarily suggesting you should try , especially on short - haul budget airline flights , but it may come as a surprise for many to learn that it is not against the law to join the mile high club			2
however it is illegal for a passenger to disobey the commands of a flight attendant demanding you open the door and let other passengers got to the toilet			2
naughty : if you absolutely have to join the mile high club it 's actually legal but the flight attendants will know exactly what you 're up to and do n't fool yourself for one moment that you are being discreet - the flight attendants have seen it all before and will know exactly what you are up to			1
so if you are really that determined to indulge in mid-air bonk just make it quick and please , for the love of @entity133 , remember to clean up afterwards			0
and just in case you did n't know , those airline lavatory doors can be opened from the outside too			2
they really can fight they may be there to serve you drinks and food but do n't even think about messing with a flight attendant			0
attendants , both male and female , are now required to undergo self - defence training in which they practice sparring with each other as well as kicking and punching dummies			1
this is so they are prepared to deal with serious security threats such as if someone tries to rush into the cockpit and take over the plane			0
they are helping to stamp out human trafficking flight attendants work alongside law enforcement agents to help spot and rescue victims of human trafficking			1
in the @entity164 attendants are trained by the @entity165 to recognise signs of when a person is being trafficked			0
these include when an adult does n't know the name of a child he or she is accompanying or if a group of young women who do n't speak @entity175 are being escorted by a single person			0
now a new app has been launched that instantly tips off the authorities when airline staff suspect someone is being trafficked			1
the app even allows attendants to upload video of a suspect to use as evidence			0
belt up : the walk down the cabin to ensure passengers safety belts are fastened is known in the trade as the ' crotch watch ' 7			1
those headphones that come wrapped up are actually far from new they may look factory fresh by those neatly - wrapped headsets you find waiting for you on your seat are actually far from new			1
at the end of each flight the headsets are collected , given a quick dust and clean before simply being re-packaged for the next flight			0
a brand new headset for every single passenger would add up to many millions of pounds over the years and the bottom line for any airline is making money			0
you ca n't use electronic devices but they do while passengers are ordered to turn off all electronic devices for the duration of a flight the same rules do n't appear to apply to attendants			1
when they are safely hidden from view one of the first things many attendants reportedly do is dig out their mobiles to fire off a few texts			0
but if you happen to catch them in the act - do n't worry a mobile phone is not capable of bringing down a flight - the worst they can do is cause minor radio interference which can be annoying to the pilots			1
they 're all beauty experts they 've worked their way through a gruelling long - haul flight but when it comes to say goodbye they somehow look as fresh as daisies			0
on some airlines , flight attendants are given on - the - job beauty training where they are taught the beauty tricks of the trade			1
on @entity240 these include drinking at least at least one litre of water before , during and after a flight , exfoliating the night before a flight , having eyelashes tinted to give then colour , length and volume , using a hydrating facial spray and applying lip balm to cuticles to keep nails hydrated			1
tough customer : flight attendants are now given self - defence training so they are prepared to deal with security threats 10			1
they have to deal with some pretty crazy requests as well as the infuriating passengers who insist on repeatedly pressing the overhead flight attendant button throughout the flight , attendants regularly have to deal with some ridiculous questions .			1

@entity264 used to describe different types of passengers and staff
girls given self - defence training ( so do n't call them trolley dollies )
they are now working with authorities to stamp out human trafficking
