@entity44 , chairman of the federation ’s @entity46 branch , said : ‘ @entity2 has very little experience of policing and has attracted criticism from the rank and file over the way he has conducted his reviews into police reform			1
‘ the home secretary will have her own reasons for choosing mr @entity2 over other credible candidates – at this time i am struggling to understand what they might be			2
’ but ministers insisted mr @entity2 was the right man for the job and would be independent both of the police and the government			1
cuts fury : officers jeer @entity70 as she backs @entity2 's policing reforms - which would include fitness tests and pay cuts for some officers - as she appears at the @entity17 annual conference last month police minister @entity76 told the today programme yesterday : ‘ the direction of travel over the last few years has been to ensure that the inspectorate is more independent , not just of the government ... but also of the police service itself			1
’ federation chairman @entity83 was left humiliated during the interview after he suggested senior officers were set to resign over the appointment			1
but he then admitted he had spoken to just ‘ one middle ranking officer ’			0
mr @entity83 said : ‘ he is not just there as a regulator , he is there to give , hopefully , sagacious advice from a profound understanding of policing			2
‘ he is going to be in some very high - powered meetings on occasions where the prime minister and home secretary say , “ @entity2 , what do you think ? ”			2
‘ and he is not going to know			0
he ’s going to have to say , “ look , i ’m going to have to phone one of my advisers ”			0
‘ that is not a position we should have somebody in who is going to be giving advice to government			0
’ last month thousands of police marched to protest over changes to pay , conditions and pensions			2
police shake - up : the appointment of @entity2 has sparked further anger among rank and file officers , just weeks after home secretary @entity70 was heckled at the @entity17 conference mr @entity2 is unpopular among officers after he proposed cutting bonuses and introducing compulsory fitness tests in his wide - ranging review of policing			1
among the more controversial proposals in his two reports , mr @entity2 recommended that police constables ' starting salaries should be cut by up to £ 4,500 and that the retirement age should be raised to 60			1
controversial choice : @entity70 risks angering rank and file police officers by choosing lawyer @entity2 as her preferred choice as the next chief inspector of @entity10 his suggestion that chief constables should have the power to sack officers were described by @entity17 leaders as ‘ meddling with the very bedrock of @entity143 policing ’			1
mr @entity2 , a lawyer and former rail regulator , was selected following an interview process conducted by the home secretary , @entity70			1
@entity148 chief constable @entity147 , and the top officer in the @entity150 , @entity149 , who is also a senior figure in the @entity152 , are understood to have applied but lost out			0

before his appointment is confirmed , mr @entity2 faces a grilling by the @entity155 , which has vocally criticised how his reports were compiled			2
@entity157 , @entity158 mp for @entity159 and @entity160 , said she was ' stunned ' by the decision , saying she could not even believe reports that mr @entity2 had applied			1
@entity163 , of the @entity164 ( @entity164 ) think - tank , saying he was a ' risky if not reckless choice ' which could damage the reputation of @entity169 ( @entity169 )			0
' as well as putting the relationship between @entity172 and the police under further strain , this provocative choice could put at risk the growing reputation and contribution of @entity169 at a crucial time			0
' @entity40 minister @entity179 said mrs may was ' probably ' right in recommending mr @entity2 for the role , but added he still had hurdles to overcome before his appointment			1
' if @entity70 has @entity2 as her preferred candidate then she probably has very good reason to have him in that way , ' she said			2
' the fact that he is not from a police background is innovative and it may be brilliant			0
' she told @entity189 's today programme there were ' still hurdles for @entity2 to pass ' because he must prove to the @entity193 ' he has the understanding to do the job '			1
' @entity70 believes he can , i believe @entity70 is probably , almost certainly , right			0
' a @entity40 spokesman said : ‘ @entity2 has been named as the preferred candidate for the role of @entity9 ’s chief inspector of constabulary			2
‘ he will appear before the @entity193 before the appointment goes to the prime minister and the @entity203 for approval			0
’ @entity158 ’s former home secretary @entity205 said it was ' a very odd moment ' for mr @entity2 to be named preferred candidate for the @entity169 role when the police are dealing with cuts and many officers are up in arms about his reports			1
mr @entity205 told @entity189 ’s @entity214 : ' it is almost like poking a stick through the bars of the lion ’s den , at a moment when the police service are most on edge and most subject to disagreement and friction			1
problems : the move has prompted anger and surprise among rank - and - file officers , with much criticism focusing on mr @entity2 's lack of policing experience ' i think the home secretary has taken a deliberate decision to say to the service ‘ not only are we not backing off to your objections to @entity2 , we are not actually going to be listening to your cry of pain in terms of what ’s happening to the service as a whole ’			1
' he added : ' i have certainly no objection personally to @entity2 , nor in principle to bringing him in from outside			2
' but he said it was ' not the role ' of the chief inspector to force through @entity172 reforms , but to offer ministers independent advice			0
' the home secretary needs advice , ' said mr @entity205			2
' she has abolished the @entity256 , the police authorities are being replaced by elected @entity258 , the @entity152 is effectively being dismantled			0
where is that advice going to come from ? ' it ca n’t come from someone who is not rooted in the service and is seen by the police service as antagonistic			0
