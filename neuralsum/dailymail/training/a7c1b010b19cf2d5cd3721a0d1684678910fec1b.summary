doctors have been left baffled after a @entity2 pensioner woke from a two - week coma speaking perfect @entity4 - but not a word of her native language			1
@entity7 , 94 , had been unconscious for a fortnight after suffering a stroke , which doctors had feared she may not recover from			2
when she finally awoke , the retired teacher asked in perfect @entity4 : ' where am i ? what is happening ? ' surprised doctors were left even more confused when it became clear ms @entity7 - who used to teach @entity4 - had lost all ability to speak her native @entity2			1
@entity19 woke up from a two week coma , speaking only @entity4 and not her native @entity21 an @entity4 - speaking doctor was brought in to talk to the pensioner , who confirmed she was speaking the language perfectly - although a little slowly			1
her shocked family say while ms @entity7 had taught @entity4 previously , she had not spoken the language in more than 30 years			1
they say said she had stopped using @entity4 after retiring to live with her family on the outskirts of the city of @entity31 , in southern @entity2 's @entity33 province			2
@entity34 , 45 , said : ' i ca n't ever remember having a case like this before but we anticipate with proper rehabilitation and rest she should regain the ability to speak @entity21			1
' we assume that the area dealing with her ability to speak @entity21 has been damaged , but brain cells to have an ability to repair themselves to a certain extent we would hope to see at least some improvement			1
' ms @entity7 was admitted to hospital after suffering a type of stroke called a cerebral infarction , where the blood supply is limited rather than instantly cut off by a blockage			1

there was also the case of a @entity77 navy veteran was found unconscious in a motel room who had no recollection of who he was and woke up speaking fluent @entity83			0
a @entity85 neuroscientist suggested a possible explanation last year			0
dr @entity87 said the brain was made up of different circuits - which assist in language , breathing , speaking and thinking - similar to electronic circuits			2
according to him , it is possible in @entity65 's case that the parts of the brain which recalled @entity4 were damaged in the crash and those that retained @entity67 were activated when the 22 - year - old woke up			2
whether this is what happened to ms @entity7 is not known			1
more commonly , people are known to have woken up with a different accent , like in the case of @entity104 , who was born and bred in @entity105			0
