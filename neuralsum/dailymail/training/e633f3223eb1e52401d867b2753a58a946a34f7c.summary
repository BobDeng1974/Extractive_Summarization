she said : ' when i was 13 i had a disagreement with one of my friends at school and i thought it was all sorted			0
then one of my other friends said " she 's made a @entity22 group about you for all the people who wish i was dead already			1
" ' @entity7 aged 13 with her mother , @entity26 : they have both praised @entity10 for their support after she was a victim of online bullies she added : ' the website was shared and sent out to people to join the group and as far as i 'm aware many people did			1
' people joined the @entity22 group and left cruel comments about the teenager			1
@entity7 said the impact of the bullying affected her happiness and wellbeing			1
' before the cyber-bullying started i was happy but afterwards i did n't want to talk to anyone or be around anyone and i even cut myself off from my family , she said			0
online abuse : the teenager felt suicidal after a hate group was set up to taunt her on @entity22 ' i used to love school and was always excited to be going in to learn new things but i started to dread going			1
and i could n't just leave it at school because it followed me home			0
i 'd go on the computer and i 'd be worried that someone would say something about it while i was online			2
' she said it became so upsetting , it made her question her will to live and she even contemplated suicide			1
she recalls : ' i was very upset , words ca n't describe how upset i was			2
i thought everything had been taken away from me and i did n't know what to do			0
' it made me so i did n't want to wake up in the morning			2
i did n't want to go to school or see anybody and it made wanting to carry on living very difficult			2
at one point i did want to take my own life			0
' when @entity7 's mother , @entity26 , 45 , a shop manager , found out about the hate group set up to target her daughter she was furious but felt helpless about what could be done			1
moved on : the student is smiling again now the @entity22 group has been taken down and she got the help she needed to overcome her ordeal in a previous interview with the @entity85 said said : ' the first i heard about the hate group was when i collected @entity7 after school ; she was crying uncontrollably and told me what happened			1
' i was absolutely furious that the school knew and had not called to tell me what was happening			0
then i discovered they had not punished the girl responsible			0
i had frequent meetings with them but they were n't interested , they did n't take it seriously and i think the problem is some governors do n't even understand what a computer is , let alone cyber-bullying			0
' she added : ' the police came 24 hours after i reported what was happening but then never got back to us			0
' people sweep it under the carpet but they are playing with children 's lives			0
my daughter was in such a terrible state			0
' the bully was made to take the @entity22 group down by their headteacher but @entity7 continued to feel the impact on her confidence and because ' people were still talking about it '			1
it was @entity10 who eventually helped her after she reached out to them via their website			1

but @entity144 statistics reveal that 38 per cent of young people have been affected by it			0
a third have received abusive emails and 24 per cent have received abusive text messages			0
