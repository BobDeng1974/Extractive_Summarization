by @entity0 and @entity1 just as @entity3 comes out swinging against accusations former executive editor @entity2 was paid less than her male predecessor , @entity2 is using her free time to throw punches of her own , with a new hobby : boxing			1
the axed editor 's daughter @entity11 posted an @entity14 photo thursday afternoon showing her mom wearing gloves and smirking at a boxing bag with the message , ' @entity20 's badass new hobby			1
' with the message were the hashtags ' # girls ' and ' # pushy , ' presumably in reference to rumors @entity2 was fired for demanding more money after learning the previous , and male , editor made far more			1
scroll down for @entity3 's full statement ... # pushy : recently canned @entity29 executive editor @entity2 is using her newly discovered free time to take up boxing ... and to fuel rumors she was fired for being # pushy with this @entity14 photo posted by her daughter pushback : @entity29 publisher @entity3 has already swung back with a thursday memo to employees that said not only was @entity2 not paid less than her male predecessor , but was compensated more meanwhile , @entity3 said in a thursday staff memo that those reports are completely untrue			1
' it is simply not true that @entity45 ’s compensation was significantly less than her predecessors , ' he wrote in the memo , obtained by @entity49			2
' her pay is comparable to that of earlier executive editors			2
' @entity3 attributed @entity2 's termination in his wednesday announcement to the @entity29 newsroom to ' an issue with management in the newsroom			1
' the publisher said in his memo that he wanted to ' set the record straight ' about ' misinformation ' regarding @entity2 's salary			1
in fact , @entity3 claims she made even more than the man she replaced			1
' in 2013 , her last full year in the role , her total compensation package was more than 10 % higher than that of her predecessor , @entity72 , in his last full year as executive editor , which was 2010 , ' he wrote			2
' it was also higher than his total compensation in any previous year			2
' the @entity29 announced the abrupt management change on wednesday , but did n't give a reason , which prompted a flurry of speculation in media circles			1
in a blog post , @entity83 staff writer @entity82 quoted an anonymous ' close associate ' who said @entity2 confronted the @entity29 ' ' top brass ' about her pay after discovering that both her pay and her pension benefits were less than that of her male predecessor , @entity72			1
the confrontation , @entity82 wrote , ' may have fed into the management 's narrative that she was " pushy			1
" ' in thursday 's memo , @entity3 said that the only reason behind his decision to dismiss @entity98 was ' concerns i had about some aspects of @entity45 's management of our newsroom , which i had previously made clear to her , both face - to - face and in my annual assessment			1
' @entity2 , 60 , was the paper 's first female executive editor			1
she joined the newspaper in 1997 after working for nearly a decade at @entity109			2
she was the @entity29 ' @entity110 editor and bureau chief before being named managing editor in 2003			1
memo from @entity3 obtained by @entity49 dear colleagues , i am writing to you because i am concerned about the misinformation that has been widely circulating in the media since i announced @entity2 ’s departure yesterday			1
i particularly want to set the record straight about @entity45 ’s pay as executive editor of @entity123			2
it is simply not true that @entity45 ’s compensation was significantly less than her predecessors			0
her pay is comparable to that of earlier executive editors			0
in fact , in 2013 , her last full year in the role , her total compensation package was more than 10 % higher than that of her predecessor , @entity72 , in his last full year as executive editor , which was 2010			0
it was also higher than his total compensation in any previous year			0
comparisons between the pensions of different executive editors are difficult for several reasons			0
pensions are based upon years of service with the @entity147			0
@entity45 ’s years of service were significantly fewer than those of many of her predecessors			0
secondly , as you may know , pension plans for all managers at the @entity29 were frozen in 2009			2
but this and all other pension changes at the @entity147 have been applied without any gender bias and @entity45 was not singled out or differentially disadvantaged in any way			0
compensation played no part whatsoever in my decision that @entity45 could not remain as executive editor			0
nor did any discussion about compensation			0
the reason — the only reason — for that decision was concerns i had about some aspects of @entity45 ’s management of our newsroom , which i had previously made clear to her , both face - to - face and in my annual assessment			0
this @entity147 is fully committed to equal treatment of all its employees , regardless of gender , race , ethnicity , age , sexual orientation or any other characteristic			0
we are working hard to live up to that principle in every part of our organization			0
i am satisfied that we fully lived up to that commitment with regard to @entity45			0

@entity2 's daughter posted an @entity14 photo of her mom boxing , along with the hashtags # girls and # pushy
the social media left hook was a *nod* to reports that @entity2 was pushed out for being pushy
her boss , @entity29 publisher @entity3 , swung back with a memo to staff claiming the reports are *rubbish*
