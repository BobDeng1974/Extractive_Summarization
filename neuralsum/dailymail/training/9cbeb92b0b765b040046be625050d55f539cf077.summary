at its launch event in september , @entity1 boss @entity0 said prices for the firm 's upcoming watch would start at $ 349 - but he refused to go into more detail			1
now , @entity10 website @entity8 has been told by a ' reliable source ' that the stainless steel model will be available from $ 500 , while the gold version will set customers back up to $ 5,000			1
and the source also revealed the firm is on track to release its first wearable around @entity19 , as per previous rumours - dismissing more recent claims of a spring release			2
' but it stressed that it is ' impossible to be absolutely certain of the truth of these indiscretions			0
' @entity1 's watch will be available in three models : @entity44 , stainless steel and gold			1
the prices for @entity1 ’s 27 - inch @entity48 with @entity50 display , bought directly from the @entity51 and @entity53 @entity1 stores differ significantly			2
in the @entity53 , the high - end @entity48 costs $ 2,503 without state taxes			1
when state tax for @entity56 is added - a state with one of the highest taxes in the country at an average of 9 per cent - the price increases to $ 2,727.91			2
in addition to this , @entity56 laws state that a recycle fee must be added of $ 4			2
this brings the total cost of the order to $ 2727.91 , which converts to £ 1,704			0
by comparison , the total price for the @entity48 in the @entity51 is £ 1,999 with vat of £ 333.17 already included			0
this is a difference of £ 295			0
within the gold range , users will be able to choose from rose gold and yellow gold , and prices are expected to range between $ 4,000 and $ 5,000			1
this converts to £ 2,510 and £ 3,130 , but conversions ca n't be used to determine global prices because @entity1 typically sets prices on a region - by - region basis			2
earlier this week , @entity85 reported @entity86 , @entity1 's senior vice president of retail and online stores as saying : ' we ’re going into the holidays , we ’ll go into @entity90 , and then we ’ve got a new watch launch coming in the spring			1
' @entity1 's chief executive @entity0 unveiled the watch at a launch event in september			1
he did n't announce exactly when the watch would be available , but said it would go on sale ' early next year			0
' a ' source close to @entity1 ' told the information last month that the firm ' would be lucky to ship [ the watch ] before @entity19 '			2
@entity90 falls on 19 february next year , so ms @entity102 comments push it at least beyond this date			0
despite the range of impressive features unveiled by mr @entity0 , there was something he failed to mention : battery life			1
the telling omission suggests the watch ’s battery life will be the @entity113 of the device when it eventually does go on sale			1
the source also revealed @entity1 is on track to release its first wearable around @entity19 , as per previous rumours - dismissing more recent claims of a spring release			1
@entity1 's watch will be available in a sport model , stainless steel and gold			1
within the gold range , users will choose from rose gold ( pictured ) and yellow gold despite reports claiming the watch ( pictured with boss @entity0 ) would launch in february , a statement recently suggested it has been delayed until ' spring			1
' @entity86 , @entity1 's senior vice president of retail and online stores said : ' we ’ll go into @entity90 , and then we ’ve got a new watch launch coming ' @entity1 is said to be unhappy with the watch 's battery life , and the long lead time before the $ 349 ( £ 216 ) product ships could mean the device will be more functional once it 's released early next year			1

the closest @entity0 came to talking about the battery life for the watch was saying that users would ‘ charge it at night			1
’ during an interview in @entity213 , @entity1 's senior vice president of operations @entity211 said : ' we want to make the best product in the world			0
' one of our competitors is on their fourth or fifth attempt , but nobody is wearing them			0
' the company 's chief executive added that the @entity156 ‘ can be worn all day , for any occasion , ’ but hourly figures were notably absent			0
a source said @entity1 is unhappy with the watch 's battery life , according to @entity228			1
another source confirmed to the technology site that that the battery life ‘ is about a day now			2
’ @entity1 's chief executive @entity0 ( pictured ) unveiled the watch at a launch event in september			1
although he did n't reveal battery life details , mr @entity0 did spend some time talking about the watch 's charging system , which combines @entity1 ’s magsafe technology with inductive charging the watch has a completely new user interface ( left ) , different from the @entity33 , and the ' crown ' on the @entity156 is a dial called the ' digital crown ' ( right ) presented by chief executive @entity0 the company 's chief executive added the @entity156 ‘ can be worn all day , for any occasion , ’ but hourly figures were notably absent			1
the long lead time before the $ 349 ( £ 216 ) product ships could mean the device will be more functional once it 's released early next year a spokesperson for @entity1 declined to provide battery details to @entity252 and said they will be revealed closer to launch next year			1
like many of @entity1 ’s other products , the @entity156 appears to have a sealed back , which means the battery can not be replaced			2
this suggests that the entire $ 349 ( £ 216 ) device will have to be replaced , once the battery eventually deteriorates from constant charging and use			2
another concern is the launch of the health and activity - tracking apps on the @entity156 , which will rely on adequate battery life for round - the - clock monitoring			1
companies including @entity269 and @entity270 have health trackers that are designed to be worn at night too , monitoring sleep patterns through movements			0
however , if the watch has to be charged at night , vital health signs could be missed companies including @entity269 and @entity270 have health trackers that are designed to be worn at night too , monitoring sleep patterns through movements			0
however , if the watch has to be charged at night , vital health signs could be missed by the gadget which @entity1 says will ‘ motivate people to be more active and more healthy			2
’ @entity1 did , however , spend some time talking about the watch 's charging system , which combines @entity1 ’s magsafe technology with inductive charging			2
@entity1 ’s silence on battery life suggests the company is still working to improve the feature			1
