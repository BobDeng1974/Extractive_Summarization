@entity0 could be forced to scrap its latest @entity2 connectors under plans to create a universal phone charger in the @entity5			1
an @entity6 has voted to standardise power connectors so that everyone who buys a handset in the @entity5 gets the same type of charger , expected to be a @entity13 connector			1

a @entity6 has voted to standardise power connectors so everyone who buys a handset in the @entity5 gets the same type of charger the proposal passed with a unanimous vote and was filed in a bid to reduce the amount of waste created by old or unused phone chargers			1
these changes would also benefit phone customers who could easily borrow or swap chargers , and could additionally be extended to include tablet connectors , too			0
however , this has n't been passed as a law yet , and may not ever become law ; it was a vote carried by a single group of @entity46			0
in a statement issued last week , the committee announced it ' will decide later whether to start informal negotiations with the @entity50 in order to seek an early first - reading agreement			0
' the majority of @entity56 and @entity55 handsets are charged using what 's called a @entity13 port - a smaller version of the usb ports used on many pen drives , laptops and @entity63 @entity0 is renowned for having unique chargers			0
it introduced its @entity24 in september 2012 , which was shipped automatically with the then - new @entity2 , and this connector replaced the @entity0 30 - pin connector that charged older models of the phone , as well as its ipods			1
many @entity56 and @entity55 handsets , including @entity73 's @entity72 , left , are charged using a microusb connector , far right , that is a smaller version of usb ports used on laptops and pcs , for example @entity0 introduced its @entity24 in september 2012			1
the @entity24 connector is said to offer ' faster file transfers ' when plugged into a laptop and can be inserted either way up			2
an update in @entity0 's @entity83 prevents users from charging their phones using @entity87 chargers			0
the @entity24 connector is said to offer ' faster file transfers ' when plugged into a laptop , for example , and can be inserted either way up , unlike the @entity13			2
customers can still use the @entity24 connector with other devices , but only if an adapter is bought separately for around Â£ 25			2
an update in @entity0 's @entity83 prevents users from charging their phones using @entity87 chargers			0
this was suggested to have been in response to a number of injuries and a death of @entity0 customers in @entity103 who were said to have bought cheap , knock - off chargers .			0

@entity107 has voted to create a universal phone charger
this means every phone sold in the @entity5 would have the same connector
@entity0 uses @entity24 connectors that only work with @entity2 , @entity115 and @entity116
this *ruling* could mean it has to scrap this connector , but only in the @entity5
