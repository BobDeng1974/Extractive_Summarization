a primary school has become the first in @entity2 to ban packed lunches – after concerns that some parents were sending their children with leftover takeaways			1
a government inspector called in by the school found that fewer than 1 per cent of its pupils brought packed lunches that were considered healthy			1
under controversial plans , every primary school will have to offer free lunches to all four - to seven - year - olds from september – and the headmaster of @entity18 ’ primary in @entity19 , @entity20 , is so horrified by the standard of food some children have been bringing from home that the free lunches will become the only option			1
one father of two said : ‘ i think it ’s ridiculous and wrong that the school is stepping in to act as surrogate parents to our children			2
‘ it is an insult to parents to say that we are unable to feed our children properly and it should be against the law to ban freedom of choice			2
we are living in a nanny state which now governs what our children should eat			0
‘ there will be children who go under - nourished because they do n’t like what the school has to offer			2
’ main vegetable ravioli with garlic bread chicken tikka curry , rice , naan butter pie ( onion and potato ) hot turkey filled sub roll cod and salmon fishcake side carrots and sweetcorn hash browns , new potatoes peas , pickled beetroot salad bar oven baked chips and mash dessert pineapple upside down pudding @entity79 chocolate cookie @entity81 , @entity82 , custard angel delight , shortbread , fruit another parent said : ‘ i , along with other parents at the school , feel like our freedom of choice and liberty in this respect have been taken away from us			1
' for those parents of children with food allergies and intolerances the food choices they make for their children are an important factor in their daily lives which i can only imagine must be difficult and time consuming			0
’ but another parent welcomed the packed lunch ban , claiming : ‘ some parents just give their kids crisps and chocolate for lunch or the remains of last night ’s takeaway			2
’ the ban , which comes into force in september , applies to all of the school ’s pupils , who are aged between five and seven			0
headmaster @entity116 defended the decision , saying only two parents had complained about it			0
under fire : @entity121 has been criticised for forcing schools to offer meals before they have the facilities he was spurred into action after inviting an inspector from the @entity128 to examine a selection of pupils ’ packed lunches and finding that more than 99 per cent of them did not meet ‘ nutritional requirements ’			1
he added : ‘ if you start making exceptions , that will cause problems as the parents whose child is eating meals that are not balanced are going to slip through the net			0
‘ it is free and we are catering for diets and allergies			0
if they previously went to a nursery they would always have to eat what they provide so we are not doing anything totally off the planet			0
' we are trying to provide the very best meals for children and we are providing a packed lunch option in school so they can have that or a hot meal			1

pupils at @entity161 , @entity20 , had chocolate bars for lunch
@entity29 responded to *damning* inspection by banning all packed lunches
believed to be the first to follow @entity121 *'s* plan for **compulsory** meals
now provide **compulsory** vegan , *gluten* - free menu for all under - sevens
parents outraged at lack of ' choice and liberty ' to cook for their children
