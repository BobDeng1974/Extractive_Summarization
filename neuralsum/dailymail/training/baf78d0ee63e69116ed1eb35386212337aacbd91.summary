by @entity0 published : 17:34 est , 6 march 2014 updated : 17:51 est , 6 march 2014 the ' foodie ' revolution is helping the independent food shops that were once waning on @entity6 high streets , with food shops like butchers and bakers rising in numbers by 27 per cent			1
new research has revealed that the @entity6 town centre has seen a 31 per cent rise year on year in the number of bakers , and a 28 per cent rise in the number of fishmongers , who have moved into the previously empty high street			1
experts have also partly attributed the 27 per cent rise to the backlash against supermarkets following the horse meat scandal last year			1
butcher shops are one of the many types of food stores that have been revitalised by a combination of recent foodie crazes and supermarket criticism an insurance group analysed over 40,000 retail outlets between 2012 and 2013 and recorded a 27 per cent rise in the number occupied by independent food and drink traders			1
having previously had their sales numbers hit by the discounts offered by huge supermarket chains , many now find shoppers prefer to pay more to guarantee quality			0
the horsemeat scandal a year ago and an improving economy has encouraged some consumers to no longer simply buy the cheapest food and drink available			0
traders are also taking advantage of local and national government schemes to revitalise town centres , such as relaxed parking restrictions or rate cuts			0
@entity6 high street food stores like grocers and fishmongers have been going slightly empty in the last couple of years due to the intense competition from big name supermarkets that smaller stores can not compete with ( pictured : @entity62 high street , @entity63 ) the biggest rise has been a 65 per cent rise in the number of independent supermarkets in @entity67 , such as smaller grocers not owned by supermarket chains like @entity70 or @entity71 's			1
independent supermarket - up 65 % general food store - up 32 % bakery - up 31 % fishmonger - up 28 % delicatessen - up 25 % greengrocer - 24 % wine merchant - up 10 % @entity76 - up 9 % this is followed by a 32 per cent rise in smaller food and drink retailers such as the traditional corner shop and a 25 per cent increase in delicatessens , it added			2
it has helped reduce the number of empty shops in @entity67 to a three year low by the end of 2013 , said simply business which specialises in small and medium sized companies			0
simply business chief @entity91 said : ' the surge in independent food merchants exemplifies the nimble nature of small businesses as their success is often determined by smartly tapping into growing trends at the right time			0
' we hope these independent food and drink stores will profit from consumers turning their backs on established supermarket chains in favour of their local providers who breath new life into community high streets			2
' independent businesses are vital to the ongoing growth of the @entity6 economy and our findings reinforce this .			0
