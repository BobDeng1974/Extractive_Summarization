last season 's best two under - 21 sides shared the points in a pulsating match in west @entity4 , with both sides pushing hard for the win before settling for a draw			0
@entity8 fielded @entity9 and @entity10 , both of whom have seen first team football under @entity14 , together at centre back as both looked to put their case that they can be trusted to fill the crisis position at @entity19			1
but they were both upstaged by another central defender , as @entity22 's header earned @entity23 a share of the spoils			2
@entity26 holds off @entity27 as @entity23 shaded the first half at @entity29 on sunday @entity9 , on the bench at @entity19 on saturday , was in action for @entity8 's under - 21 side @entity33 attempts to close down @entity8 's goalscorer @entity34 there were few chances in an even first half , a @entity36 free kick comfortably saved by @entity37 the closest either side came in the first half hour			1
@entity23 began to come into the ascendancy late in the half , and could have gone ahead in the final few moments , @entity33 heading wide from an @entity26 cross			2
but moments after the break it was @entity8 who took the lead			0
@entity51 was adjudged to have handled @entity27 's cross deliberately , and @entity34 stepped up to slot home			0
@entity34 converts from the penalty spot after @entity51 was penalised for handball just inside the box @entity8 celebrate taking the lead early in the second half , and could have doubled their lead soon after @entity8 almost doubled their lead soon after , @entity9 , who was on the bench for @entity63 's side against @entity64 on saturday , charging forward from the back but unable to convert a good chance			1
and the visitors were punished for their wastefulness soon after , when @entity22 headed from @entity36 's corner , having been left totally unmarked			1
both sides pushed for the win , but in the end a draw was the right result			0
@entity22 ( second right ) celebrates after levelling the scores with a header from a corner			0

@entity34 puts united ahead from the penalty spot after half time
@entity22 heads @entity23 level from @entity36 corner
