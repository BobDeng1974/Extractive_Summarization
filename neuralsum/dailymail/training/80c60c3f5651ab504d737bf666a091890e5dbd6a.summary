by @entity0 and @entity1 the evening of 11 - year - old @entity3 's murder remains very clear in the memory of mother @entity5			1
she recalled the moment her ex-partner @entity7 turned up with a ' big smile ' at his son 's cricket practice in @entity11 , south of @entity12 , on february 12 but soon after she heard a ' very disturbing sound '			1
' i ran towards the sound because i did n't understand what it was and i could see @entity7 kneeling beside @entity3 and i thought , oh my @entity17 , he 's done a fast bowl to his head and he 's knocked him out and he 's really hurt him , ' she told the @entity21 program @entity20			2
his father , @entity7 , was shot by police at the scene and later died but it was just before @entity7 resisted arrest by police that cricket coach @entity31 , who initially thought the horrific attack was an accident , spoke with @entity3 's father			1
' i asked @entity7 , how 's he doing ? and that 's when he said , " yeah , he 's okay , he 's fine , he 's in heaven now "			0

@entity7 was shot by police at the scene and later died			2
ms @entity5 said she found it ' gravely concerning ' that police did n't tell her about frightening death threats made by his @entity3 's father just weeks before he killed their son			1
@entity7 had threatened to kill one of his housemates - asking him if he wanted to die , before suggesting he would cut his head off			0

at this stage , @entity7 was only allowed to see @entity3 in public when he was playing sport after ms @entity5 was informed he had been caught viewing child pornography images			2
' for some reasons i thought he was safer in an open space with people around , ' ms @entity5 said			0
@entity86 police commissioner @entity85 said stringent privacy laws limited the amount of information available to potential victims			0
' from a victim 's perspective , i suspect you 'd be very angry if you were n't privy to that sort of information , ' he said			0
however , he said the pending coroner 's inquest into @entity3 's death limited what he could say about his feelings on the issue			1
' i hope to be in a position , once the coroner comes back , to be making some public comments about these issues which might better reflect my views on things			0
