by @entity1 reporter published : 15:15 est , 29 january 2014 updated : 17:42 est , 29 january 2014 @entity4 prime minister @entity3 says he wants to ditch the @entity5 from his country 's national flag and replace it with the silver fern , hinting at the possibility of a referendum on the issue as early as this year			1
mr @entity3 said he was planning to discuss the matter with senior ministers adding he would personally like to see a new flag using a symbol drawn from @entity4 's native flora			1
he said : ' my own personal view is that the silver fern is the right way to go			2
in my view , the silver fern is something which is applied to our greatest sporting teams			0
the current @entity4 flag , left , and the silver fern symbol of the @entity29 rugby team , right ' it has international recognition and cachet			1
i think it 's part of the modern new look of @entity4			1
' mr @entity3 said he believed the country was split 50 - 50 on the subject			0
if a referendum was to be held , the public would likely be offered a choice of the current flag or a government - chosen alternative			2
@entity4 prime minister @entity3 said he favours a switch to the silver fern ' we have to make it simple , ' mr @entity3 added			1
debate over whether @entity4 should change its flag has been raging since the early 1970s			1
many @entity4 argue that their country 's ensign is too similar to that of @entity52			2
both country 's flags have the @entity5 flag in the left hand corner and are adorned by stars			2
others believe having the @entity5 as part of their flag rings of @entity62 imperialism and makes @entity4 look like a colony			1
among those that want to see the flag changed there is much debate over what its replacement should look like			0
@entity71 deputy leader @entity70 said he supports a change to a red , white and blue incorporating both @entity74 and colonial influences			0
the current flag dates from 1865 , when the @entity77 insisted colonial ships use the @entity80 ensign - a blue flag with the @entity82 in the top left corner			0
in 1869 , the southern cross was added by order of the then governor sir @entity86			0
the constellation can only be seen in the @entity88			0
it was approved as the national flag by @entity91 in 1902			0
the silver fern is the proud symbol of the all conquering @entity29 rugby team however many servicemen are expected to oppose the idea on the grounds that @entity4 have fought and died under the colours and to change it would be disrespectful , especially in the centenary of the outbreak of @entity103 i. @entity104 , leader of the @entity106 , and an important political ally of mr @entity3 , told the @entity108 : ' men fought under that flag and sacrificed their lives in many war campaigns and , for me , i 'm a bit old - fashioned			1
' i do n't want the name of the country changed , the flag changed , and @entity118			0

@entity4 *pm* to discuss the matter with senior ministers
hints at the possibility of a referendum as early as this year
many @entity4 see the @entity5 as a symbol of @entity62 colonialism
others say changing it would be an insult to men who have died under it
