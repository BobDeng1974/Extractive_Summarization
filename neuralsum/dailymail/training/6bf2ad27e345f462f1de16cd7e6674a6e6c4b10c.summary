i ca n’t live with the horror of what i have done			0
’ prosecutors have now accepted that the 42 - year - old was overwhelmed by depression when she killed her four - year - old daughter @entity17 and three - year - old twins @entity19 and @entity20 , and wanted ‘ a way out of their joint suffering ’			1
no trial : @entity5 , has admitted killing her twins three - year - old sons @entity20 and @entity19 ( pictured with father @entity11 ) and their older sister @entity17 , four , but will not face a murder trial , a judge said today she has pleaded guilty to their manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility			1
now having psychiatric treatment , @entity35 is said to ‘ bitterly regret ’ her children ’s deaths			1
although his wife did not appear in court , mr @entity35 , 43 , a director with @entity40 bank @entity39 , attended the short hearing , but made no comment			2

he told a neighbour they loved each other to pieces			0
’ another neighbour said mr @entity35 visited his wife every day			2
accepting the mother ’s plea , the @entity60 agreed that @entity35 was ‘ unable to form a rational judgment ’ at the time of the killings			2
bereft : her husband @entity35 ( pictured at the @entity69 today ) was in @entity70 with the couple 's eldest child when the deaths occurred prosecutor @entity74 told the @entity69 : ‘ although the term “ mercy killing ” has no legal or psychiatric definition , it is clear mrs @entity5 killed her three children because she wanted to end their suffering			1
‘ at the time she committed the act she could not see any alternative or any other way out of their joint suffering – both her suffering and the suffering of her children			2
’ all three children had type 2 spinal muscular atrophy , a degenerative muscle - wasting condition , which usually leaves sufferers unable to stand or walk unaided			1
it does not affect the mind , meaning children of normal intelligence are trapped in weak bodies and face progressive loss of control over movement and mobility			0
most sufferers live into their teenage years or adulthood , according to charities			0
@entity17 was diagnosed with the condition while @entity35 was pregnant with the twins , who were then diagnosed after birth			1
@entity35 , who is originally from @entity70 , gave up her job as a graphic designer to care for the children , and the family spent around £ 1million on their £ 2million home in @entity114 , south - west @entity115 , equipping it with a lift and ramps			1
neighbour @entity119 , 87 , said they had seemed ‘ a very happy little family ’ , despite the children ’s disabilities			0
at the time of the killings , mr @entity35 was in @entity70 visiting relatives with the couple ’s eldest child , now eight , who does not suffer from the condition			2
after the children ’s nanny and a neighbour became concerned when they did n’t see any activity at the five - bedroom home , they found @entity35 weeping and bleeding from her wrist in an upstairs bedroom			1
she had left a series of notes in the house , including one in @entity143 warning her husband not to allow their daughter into the children ’s bedrooms , where their bodies were found			1
police were called and she immediately confessed to the killings , telling an officer : ‘ i ’m sorry			0
i ’m sorry ... i killed them			0
’ @entity35 ’s lawyer @entity156 told the court : ‘ this is a truly tragic case			0
anybody who reads the evidence can not fail to be moved			0
‘ this offending did occur while mrs @entity5 was suffering from an abnormality of the mind			2
‘ she was manifesting stress throughout the life of the children with the pain they were suffering			0
‘ caring for three children in that condition was exhausting , distressing , debilitating and turned out to be overwhelming , and mrs @entity5 could n’t see any hope for the future and any way of continuing			1
‘ now she bitterly regrets her actions , the deaths of the three children and the impact upon her surviving daughter , who is cared for by mr @entity35			2
