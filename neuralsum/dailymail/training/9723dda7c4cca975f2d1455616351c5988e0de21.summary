by @entity0 and @entity1 and @entity2 created : 05:19 est , 25 march 2014 a legal firm has taken £ 2.5 million in taxpayers money from a public inquiry into the deaths of @entity8 men - even though the investigation 's key claim has now been abandoned due to a lack of evidence			1
@entity14 - based public interest lawyers represented the relatives of more than 20 @entity8 who claimed the men were taken prisoner by @entity18 soldiers , and later mistreated and murdered			1
despite the relatives withdrawing their claims last week , the @entity19 confirmed that it has spent more than £ 22million of public money on the investigation - including handing £ 2.5million over to @entity13 run by the ' committed socialist ' solicitor @entity24			1
probe : despite the money that went to @entity13 , allegations that soldiers had executed @entity8 captives were unfounded			1
the above photograph , shown during the inquiry , shows a soldier guarding prisoners a spokesperson for the @entity19 told @entity34 : ' the £ 2.5 million has all gone to @entity35 [ @entity13 ] but that ’s not just legal costs			2
it ’s also the cost for witnesses : expenses for witnesses to come over from @entity8 and to hear some of them via video link from overseas			1
' it is understood that the money received by @entity13 included covering the cost of flying and accommodating 15 key witnesses in @entity18 , as the @entity49 's chairman sir @entity48 wanted to see them face - to - face			1
it also included the building of - and transport to and from - a ' small studio ' close to @entity8 from which an additional 40 family members of the deceased gave evidence			1
as public interest lawyers were the only legal firm working with the @entity49 , all the expenses of gathering evidence from witnesses went through them the spokesperson said			1
@entity13 is currently acting for more than 100 clients who claim their relatives were unlawfully detained , ill - treated , or killed by @entity18 forces in @entity8			1
it has secured more than £ 3million in payouts , most notably , representing the family of @entity68 - the hotel receptionist who died in 2003 in custody in @entity8			1
the subsequent inquiry cost £ 13million			2
responding to claims that @entity13 earned , as opposed to received £ 2.5million from the inquiry , @entity24 said : ' the amount of costs @entity35 has received from the @entity75 [ not legal aid ! ] for that issue is less than £ 70,000			1
' money : @entity14 - based @entity13 , run by @entity24 ( pictured ) , received £ 2.5 million in taxpayers money for representing the relatives of more than 20 @entity8 at the @entity49 the @entity49 was announced in 2009 after a long legal battle between @entity8 families and the @entity75			1
it examined allegations that troops executed 20 or more prisoners and mistreated nine others after a battle at the @entity88 base near @entity89 in may 2004			0
the inquiry was named after @entity91 , 19 - one of the men that died			2
witnesses and family members of the dead @entity8 had alleged troops from the @entity97 took bloody revenge at a camp and detention facility for the massacre of six royal military policemen a year earlier			1
the claims were strenuously denied by the @entity75 , which insisted the @entity8 were insurgents killed in battle			2
enemy dead would normally be left on the battlefield but the soldiers were apparently given an order to identify them in order to find the ringleader in the six @entity113 murder			0
last week the inquiry 's key claim was abandoned when relatives of the dead @entity8 admitted there was no evidence the men had been killed unlawfully and withdrew their claims			1
the @entity75 later said it was pleased the claims had been withdrawn			0
last week the primary strand of the @entity49 effectively fell apart when relatives admitted there was no hard evidence to suggest the insurgents were unlawfully killed in @entity18 custody			1
in a statement released as evidence drew to a close , @entity13 accepted the men were killed during a ferocious firefight , dubbed the @entity134 , near @entity89 in 2004			0
they admitted no evidence had been produced to suggest the men had been murdered unlawfully			2
the extraordinary concession provoked outrage that @entity18 troops accused of the most serious crime have had their names ' dragged through the mud ' by publicly - funded lawyers			1
at the time , colonel @entity144 , who commanded @entity18 forces in @entity146 , said : ‘ many in @entity8 and @entity146 have sought to discredit @entity18 soldiers for political purposes or have made claims for personal financial gain			1
‘ in some cases , these people have been wittingly or unwittingly looking to turn a quick buck at the expense of our fighting troops			0
‘ it is tough for the @entity75 , who are under great pressure to answer these cases , but to avoid wasting public funds we must be ready to make stronger rebuttal			0
’ @entity24 , the boss of @entity13 , describes himself as a ' committed socialist ' on his company 's website and has insisted the business is ' not motivated by financial gain '			0
following the developments last week , the @entity169 revealed that to investigate mr @entity24 ’s clients ’ claims , a team of 12 former @entity175 murder squad officers , commanded by a retired chief superintendent was recruited by the @entity49			2
rug pulled : relatives of the captives supposedly killed by @entity18 soldiers actually died in a battle near @entity89 , their relatives admitted their role was research and evidence gathering , including taking statements from @entity8 witnesses and @entity18 soldiers			1
the senior policeman is understood to have been paid more than £ 1,000 a day plus expenses			0
junior investigators on the inquiry team were paid £ 400 a day			0
along with three lawyers from @entity13 , the investigators made four visits to @entity194 to interview witnesses			0
each trip lasted two to three weeks , officials said			0
they flew business class and the group stayed at the five - star @entity200 , which is described on its website as being of ‘ spellbinding luxury ’			0
@entity91 's father is pictured here with a photograph of his son suites were hired to interview @entity8 witnesses , who stayed at a more modest hotel in the city but were permitted to dine at the @entity212			2
they were also given a ' generous ' daily living allowance			0
the inquiry team later made three business class trips to @entity216 , where they stayed in the five - star @entity218 , as they interviewed @entity8 witnesses			1
the @entity8 again stayed in a less expensive hotel but were allowed to dine in the inquiry team ’s hotel and enjoy a daily living allowance			2
investigative and ‘ other expert services ’ accounted for £ 7million			0
running costs including it and accommodation cost £ 5.9million , counsel and legal services a further £ 4.9million , core participant and witness costs £ 2.5million and general staffing £ 1.8million			0
this led to the total bill for the inquiry topping £ 22million at the end of february			0
but sources have told the @entity169 last week that the actual total is closer to £ 27million – six times the bill of the @entity241 into @entity243 ’s murder			0
speaking to @entity34 this morning , the @entity49 spokesperson said : ' over four years , [ the £ 2.5 million ] has gone on getting statements from 91 @entity8 witnesses			1
we ’ve tested the evidence of 55 of them			0
so the money has gone on that and all the related legal costs in the hearing and taking evidence from all those witnesses			2
' ' the most important witnesses – that is to say the nine who were detained by @entity18 forces and who make the allegations , and another six who were key to the central allegations – the chairman wanted to see them in person , in the hearing room , and to be able to see them face to face , ' they added			2
' so we made arrangements for them to fly from @entity8 too here			0
the other 40 – who were family members of the deceased – we set up a purpose built , very small studio overseas in a secure location closer to @entity8 so we could they evidence via video link because it ’s considerably less hassle and less expensive than getting them over here , ' the spokesperson went on			1
in a statement to @entity34 , @entity280 said : ' @entity35 has received approximately just under £ 1.83m from the @entity49			2
of that figure £ 670,990.64 is attributable to @entity13 ’s costs and of that sum less than 10 per cent is attributable to work in relation to the issue that was conceded last friday			0
' ' as you can see this is approximately 36.68 per cent of the total received			0
the balance of the monies ( £ 1,045,095.66 - 63.32 per cent ) is attributable to disbursements , including leading counsel and junior counsel ’s fees			0

@entity14 - based public interest lawyers took millions from inquiry
money was spent bringing witnesses from @entity8 to @entity18 for evidence
also built studio for other witnesses to provide evidence via video - link
however public interest lawyers claim they earned less than £ 70,000
relatives admit there is no evidence that @entity8 prisoners were murdered
an earlier version of this story stated that the @entity49 had collapsed . in fact , while the primary strand of the inquiry is no longer proceeding , other parts of the inquiry are proceeding as *planned* . we are happy to *clarify* this .
