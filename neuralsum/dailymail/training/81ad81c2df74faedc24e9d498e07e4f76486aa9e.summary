almost two years ago , @entity0 masterminded @entity3 's famous @entity2 victory over @entity4 - now he 's at the bottom of the @entity6			1
the former @entity8 midfielder was appointed manager of @entity10 on sunday and has one of the most difficult tasks in @entity14 football as he looks to arrest @entity10 ' alarming slump			2
@entity0 concedes he has a ' big job on his hands ' at a club who are £ 160million - plus in debt where losing has become a habit , and the fact he has taken the @entity10 post highlights problems facing @entity26 and @entity27 bosses ( although there are five managers in the @entity6 with experience as a champions league boss )			1
he turned down more lucrative offers abroad and will hope to lead his new club up the @entity6 table			1
here 's his in - tray at the @entity36 ... @entity0 during his first training session as @entity10 manager on a filthy day in the @entity39 @entity0 shakes hands with @entity41 as @entity42 looks on build from the back @entity10 are too easy to beat and concede goals at an alarming rate			1
in their last two matches they shipped four at @entity47 and let in two against 10 - man @entity49 - both matches were lost			0
in fact , @entity10 have won the joint - fewest games in the @entity52 this season - their solitary victory coming over @entity54			0
@entity0 knows how to organise a defence - last season @entity3 keeper @entity56 set a @entity58 record for minutes without conceding a goal			1
some of that solidity is needed at the @entity61			0
@entity62 ( right ) scores @entity47 's first goal in @entity10 's 4 - 0 defeat at @entity65 earlier this month @entity66 settled team @entity0 's predecessor @entity67 seemingly made changes for the sake of it or to show how clever he was			1
despite bemoaning in an interview that he was never able to have a settled side , the @entity71 would make three or four alterations to his line - up and often put square pegs in round holes			0
@entity0 also , as @entity78 might say , needs to play ' four - four - f * * * * * * two ' , especially at home - in that win over @entity54 , @entity10 played with two up front and @entity82 scored a hat - trick			1
it is easy to forget there are some good players in this @entity10 squad - @entity88 was bought for £ 5million not so long ago , @entity90 has played in an @entity92 final , @entity84 has scored in two @entity93 - but @entity94 is the spark and one of the best players in the division when fit			0
he needs to be nurtured			0
@entity82 ( right ) scores one of his three goals against @entity54 in @entity10 's only league win this season get the @entity104 @entity10 supporters do like a moan ( name a club where fans do n't grumble ) but there is a huge disconnect at the moment between the club and their followers and home attendances are falling off a cliff			2
many were unimpressed by @entity67 's apparent disdain for them , randomly - generated team selections and haughty air in press conferences , and some made their feelings known by invading the pitch in his last home match in charge against @entity126			0
@entity0 says he wants to play in the style that will ' make the fans happy ' and goals and victories should do the job			2
@entity10 fans made their feelings against @entity67 known with this banner , and need encouraging again @entity134 a club that is £ 160m - plus in debt can not keep relying on loan players and @entity0 must aim to bring through lads from the academy and give them a chance in the @entity6			1
the likes of midfielder @entity142 , striker @entity143 and defender @entity144 are rated by those who know but spend more time out on loan than around the @entity10 first team			0
if , as looks likely , there is another season outside the top flight , the money will dry up even further and the kids will make up more of the side			0
@entity0 would be wise to introduce some of them gradually			0
@entity143 ( second right ) has a shot on goal for @entity158 , where he is on loan from the @entity160 it 's a competitive division ok , so maybe this is a bit of a cheap shot at the @entity58 , but leading @entity10 to survival after their horror start will be a tougher job than winning the title with @entity3			1
the cliche about the championship is that it is the hardest division to get out of and while @entity10 would prefer to stay in it , @entity0 will have to adjust to his team not being favourites in virtually every match they play			2
it seems he and his assistants @entity178 and @entity179 are up for the challenge			0
@entity0 turned down a £ 2m - a - year offer to manage in @entity182			2
it has to be assumed that @entity0 , who has signed a three - year contract at @entity10 , is looking to get a @entity186 job by doing well at the @entity61			1
the fact he has to drop to the bottom of the @entity6 is a potential worry for other managers from these shores			2
but at least @entity0 knows the only way is up			0
former @entity3 boss @entity0 lifts the @entity58 trophy in may before later leaving the club @entity10 parted company with @entity67 after a dismal run of results in the second tier @entity0 ( @entity10 ) - managed @entity3 in the @entity2 @entity199 ( @entity200 ) - was boss of @entity201 @entity202 ( @entity126 ) - took charge of @entity204 and revealed his dodgy @entity206 accent @entity207 ( @entity208 ) - managed @entity210 side @entity209 in @entity2 qualifying rounds @entity212 ( @entity213 ) - lost in @entity2 qualifying rounds as @entity215 boss			1

@entity0 has been named as @entity10 ' new manager
former @entity3 boss has *replaced* @entity67 in the hot seat
@entity10 are bottom of the @entity6 table after just one win
@entity0 has several pressing *priorities* , *including* winning back the fans
@entity229 turned down offers from abroad to take @entity10 job
