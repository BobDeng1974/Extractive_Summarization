by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 10:55 est , 15 july 2013 updated : 01:47 est , 16 july 2013 prince @entity4 was last night accused of paying a lower tax rate than his servants			0
@entity8 mp @entity7 claimed the @entity4 was ‘ dodging around ’ to avoid tax			0
he said that by refusing to classify the @entity11 property empire as a corporation , @entity4 did not pay corporation tax like other big profit - making firms			1
he demanded to know why @entity4 paid just 23.6 per cent of his income in direct and indirect tax , compared with an average of 38 per cent paid by the poorest quarter of the population			0
describing the @entity11 , which owns land across the @entity35 and provides @entity4 with his income as heir to the throne , as a ‘ medieval anomaly ’ , mr @entity7 suggested the only reason it was not registered as a company was so the @entity4 could avoid tax			1
the criticism came as @entity4 ’s principal private secretary , @entity44 , appeared before mps on the @entity46 spending watchdog , the public accounts committee			1
chairman @entity49 , who led the fight against tax - dodging corporations @entity52 and @entity53 , said it was ‘ shockingly wrong ’ that the @entity4 was paying so little tax on the duchy ’s profits			1
@entity58 member mr @entity7 said : ‘ it looks to me that prince @entity4 pays a smaller proportion in tax than any of his domestic servants			1
’ mr @entity44 insisted that @entity4 actually paid the top rate of income tax , but because he counts the cost of his official duties as a business expense against his tax bill , he appears to pay less as a proportion of his gross income			1
mr @entity44 said he could do this because ‘ his business is being the @entity4 ’			1
the mps also criticised prince @entity4 for : choppy waters : the @entity4 and @entity75 also met local surfers in @entity20 grilling : @entity58 chairman @entity49 raised questions about the prince 's tax affairs with @entity44 , principal private secretary to the @entity4 and the @entity75 the @entity11 , set up in 1337 , enables the heir to the throne to have a separate income from the monarch			1
this means he does not have to pay corporation tax			1
however , he does pay income tax			2
his tax bill during the last financial year was £ 4.4million , less than a quarter of his £ 19million income			1
quoting from the @entity91 ’s annual report , mr @entity7 said : ‘ prince @entity4 ’s direct tax plus indirect tax is 24 per cent of his income for 2012 and 23.6 per cent for 2013			2
the bottom quartile of households pay direct and indirect taxes as a percentage of income of 38 per cent and the top quartile pay 33.7 per cent			0
’ questions : the @entity58 called senior aides to the prince to explain his tax affairs mr @entity44 said the amount of tax @entity4 paid was so low because of the high level of his ‘ official expenditure ’ racked up when he represents the @entity108			1
this is set against his tax bill			2
he added : ‘ the @entity4 paid last year at 50 per cent , this year at 45 per cent			0
he pays income tax on his income after relevant business expenses			2
that is what is laid out ... by the government			0
it ’s been that way since the @entity4 and the @entity108 first started paying income tax 20 years ago , so his official expenditure , which he chooses to use his private income to meet , is the equivalent of business expenses for someone else who has a business			2
‘ those costs are before tax and he pays income tax on the amount after those official expenses			0
‘ so if you just take the income before the official expenses and divide by the tax you will get the figures you were giving but that does n’t give the whole story			0
’ mr @entity7 said of the duchy : ‘ you are really dodging around because for tax purposes it ’s not a corporation but for every other purpose it is a corporation			1
’ mr @entity44 replied : ‘ i do n’t think it ’s a corporation in the way in which you say			1
‘ the @entity147 owns an estate			0
but ... @entity149 has n’t set it up as a company or a corporation			2
‘ it ’s a private estate and it ’s run as a private estate			0
’ the world ’s press has been camped outside the @entity156 of @entity157 in @entity158 for a fortnight , and social media is continually awash with rumours that the @entity162 has gone into labour			0
but yesterday the @entity75 dropped a tantalising hint that the wait could soon be over , telling well - wishers she expects the little boy or girl to arrive by the ‘ end of the week ’			0
@entity21 let slip the secret during a visit to a children ’s hospice near @entity172 in @entity11			2
as she gave an impromptu speech to the assembled guests , she said : ‘ we are all just waiting by the telephone			0
‘ we are hopeful that by the end of the week he or she will be here			0
’ a @entity180 spokesman later confirmed the comment			0
@entity44 and @entity162 ’s private office at @entity183 has refused to confirm the duchess ’s exact due date , although @entity162 herself let slip during a public walkabout earlier this year that it is ‘ mid july ’			2
sources have told the @entity190 that her due date was in fact yesterday			0
it is understood that @entity44 now has a few days off from his job as an @entity196 pilot in @entity197 , which he will spend with his wife at their @entity183 residence			1
@entity162 stayed at her parents ’ house in @entity204 this weekend , while @entity44 played in two long - standing charity polo matches .			1

senior royal aides grilled by mps who *challenged* @entity53 and @entity52
duchy of @entity11 made record £ 19million profits in 2012 - 13 , up 4 *%*
@entity58 says it looks and acts like a corporation
but *courtier* @entity44 insists it is just ' a large set of properties '
renting his @entity220 residence from himself , then claiming some of this money back as an expense so he can pay less tax ;
*enjoying* an *unfair* **commercial** *advantage* for his business **interest*s* because the duchy does not pay corporation tax ; and
using the proceeds of one of his own charities to spend on the @entity233 , where he has a **commercial** *interest* because he owns the *freehold* .
