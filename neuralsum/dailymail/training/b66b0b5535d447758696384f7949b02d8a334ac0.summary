congresswoman @entity0 is bringing 400 yellow pencils – unsharpened 0 to tuesday night 's @entity3 address , hoping to spark a bipartisan show of support for free speech in the wake of the the january 7 @entity9 massacre of journalists in @entity11			1
the shooting attack by jihadis – angered by cartoon depictions of the @entity16 prophet @entity15 – killed 11 and left 11 more injured			0
@entity0 's spokesman said tuesday that @entity18 has an opportunity to condemn it with one voice and defend the concept of free speech			1
the @entity25 @entity24 ' will hold up a yellow pencil ' at selected points during presdient @entity29 's annual speech ' to honor those who lost their lives in the pursuit of open ideas and free expression , ' @entity23 told @entity35			1
and she wants everyone gathered in the @entity38 chamber to join her			0
we 've invited all our @entity56 colleagues , ' @entity23 added in a phone interview			0
' the congresswoman will have pencils with her on the floor			0
' there are 534 members of @entity18 , including the 100 senators who will shoehorn themselves into the crowded hall			2
( one @entity38 seat remains vacant after former @entity68 rep. @entity67 's resignation			2
) members of the @entity70 and most of the president 's cabinet secretaries will also attend , along with vice president @entity73 , first lady @entity74 and selected guests			2
the @entity0 aide said at 4:00 that nearly three dozen members of @entity18 had confirmed they would be participating			1
@entity23 explained that @entity79 citizens have turned ordinary pencils into protest implements in the weeks since the writers of the @entity44 satire magazine lost their lives			1
holding a pencil above ones head is now an internationally recognized disapproval of censorship			0
from @entity11 to @entity91 to @entity92 , pencils lifted skyward have carried a message of support for what @entity44 stands for – an irreverent and unapologetic mocking tone toward anyone and anything of importance			1
' we 'd like to do it every time the president refers to the victims , and every time he refers to freedom of speech or expression , ' he said			0
@entity29 is expected to mention the @entity11 attacks at least once tuesday night			1
separately , the @entity38 passed a resolution on tuesday officially condemning the @entity44 attack and a separate deadly act of terror at a @entity11 kosher supermarket			1
' seventeen innocents lost their lives , and this resolution carries our condolences to their loved ones , ' house speaker @entity113 said in a statement			0
' with this condemnation also comes a commitment to stand with @entity79 and our allies in confronting the grave threat radical @entity16 poses to our security and way of life , ' he said			0
@entity126 ? a january 11 rally of millions in @entity11 went off without president @entity29 , who was reportedly watching football ; he will likely try to express his solidarity in his @entity3 address @entity131 : @entity132 in @entity133 and elsewhere have rallied to condemn the @entity11 magazine for showing cartoons @entity135 @entity137 : as far away as the @entity139 and @entity140 – this woman demonstrated in @entity142 – people have held pencils aloft to signify the defense of free expression in the face of religious extremism @entity0 's spokesman was more circumspect about seeing her pencil protest as a statement about religion			1
' the gesture is not meant to insult @entity132 nor is it an attack on @entity16 , ' @entity23 insisted in a followup email			0
he framed his boss 's concerns in the same language @entity29 uses – condemning ' the threat of violent extremism ' – without touching the liberal third - rail of casting suspicion on @entity16 itself			1
the idea for a pencil protest began as a @entity40 - only stunt , passed in secret from press secretary to press secretary			1
then an email from @entity23 to his colleagues was leaked to @entity169			2
suddenly it was a bipartisan idea , open to both sides of the aisle			0
' this is something we just planned to do privately , and then it would just be a surprise during the @entity3 , ' @entity23 told @entity35			0
' but because my email was leaked – that 's just how it goes			2
' ' i should have just put " confidential " on top of it , ' he joked , ' and made sure it leaked in about ten seconds			0

rep. @entity0 's spokesman says she wants to generate a show of solidarity across party lines in the wake of @entity9 massacre in @entity11
the spokesman asked fellow @entity40 in a private email what would happen if ' every dem stands up and holds a yellow *#* 2 pencil in the air during the *applause* line '
since the email was leaked , @entity0 has *expanded* her reach to *republicans* as well
pencils wo *n't* be sharpened , out of security concerns , as president @entity29 addresses a joint *session* of @entity18
pencils lifted skyward have carried a message of support for what the satire magazine @entity44 stands for , and against religious extremism
