' chillingly @entity0 , who flies a @entity15 777 for @entity17 airlines warned : ' i hope i never find myself in the situation where i go to the toilet and return to find a cockpit door that wo n't open			1
' mr @entity0 was writing for @entity7 flying magazine @entity21 en @entity22 ( @entity0 and plane ) where he expressed his fears			1
his article warned that someone could use the security procedures introduced in the aftermath of the 9/11 atrocities to prevent an aircraft 's captain re-entering the flight deck after a rest break			2
@entity35 prosecutors have determined that @entity36 waited for his captain to leave the flight deck before disabiling key pad controlling access to the cockpit			1
he then selected an altitude of 96 feet on the aircraft 's flight computer before setting it on its collision course with the @entity47			2
investigators revealed that the aircraft 's captain @entity49 can be heard banging on the cockpit door urging his colleague to open up until the jet hits the @entity47 at more than 400 miles per hour			1

how can i be sure that i can trust him ? perhaps something terrible has just happened in his life and he ’s unable to overcome it			0
' there indeed does exist a way to get back into the cockpit , but if the person inside disables this option ( the security code to get in ) , one could do nothing but sit with the passengers and wait and see what happens			2
' @entity118 airline @entity117 has set aside $ 300 million to deal with potential civil claims against the company following the @entity9 disaster			0
