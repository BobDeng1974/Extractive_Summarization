the humble honeybee may only be small , but scientists are hoping to use its brain to power a series of futuristic - style drones			1
boffins are currently working towards digitally recreating the cognitive abilities of the @entity7 or @entity7			0
their final aim is to build a robot that thinks , senses and acts just like the tiny insects			1
scientists are working towards building a robot that thinks , senses and acts just like a honeybee professor @entity18 said if they were able to recreate a fraction of the honeybees ability they would have made ' tremendous advances ' the artificial brain is being created by the @entity24 , which is a collaboration between researchers from the universities of @entity28 and @entity29			1
one day it is hoped the remote controlled machines could be used to pollinate crops or even assist on search and rescue missions			0
' bees and all other insects are miracles of engineering which we are nowhere near equalling , ' professor @entity18 reportedly told the @entity41			0
' if we could even recreate a fraction of their abilities in a robot system then we would have made a tremendous advance			0
' building an artificial brain is a complex process and so far , scientist have only managed to clone the part of the bee 's brain which allows it to see			1
to do this they mapped out the brain of the honeybee and recreated it with circuits that fire on and off in an organic brain , @entity53 reported			2
the software is then uploaded into the drone 's circuitry which enables it to fly around in a similar fashion to the bee			0
the projects team now has three quadcopters and one ground robot , each with unique abilities and configurations			2
tests are being carried out in a dedicated flying room based at the @entity28			2
in a video footage showing initial tests the drone , powered by the artificial bee brain , can be seen flying down a corridor			0
on the @entity24 website it states : ' since the start of the project , the gb team has setup the lab , built and tested our robots , and begun to demonstrate some sophisticated visual - based navigation and cognitive functions through embodiment			1
' current projects include navigation using the @entity24 models , flight tests of our models with the @entity93 , developing a @entity94 , initial testing with the chemosensors and more			0
' building an artificial brain is a complex process and so far , scientist have only managed to clone the part of the bee 's brain which allows it to see			1

scientists aim to build robot that thinks , senses and acts like honeybee
so far team has managed to *replicate* part of brain that allows bee to see
@entity24 is a collaboration between universities of @entity28 and @entity29
