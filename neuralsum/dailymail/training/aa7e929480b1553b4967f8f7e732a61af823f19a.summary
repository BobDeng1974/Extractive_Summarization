' @entity27 added : ' it was about sending a message to racists that @entity59 are n't going to tolerate that			2

' seafood shack : the restaurant is located in @entity15 , an affluent suburb of @entity14 , @entity16 speaking after the september 7 incident to @entity79 , miss @entity30 said that she would never hold a grudge or fake a receipt simply for not receiving a tip. ' i do n't get tips all the time			1

however , some have also cast doubt on the authenticity of the writing			0
one doubter commented : ' as a black man , i simply do n't believe this is real			0
the word ' none ' has totally different handwriting from the word ' ni * * er. ' there 's lots of stories lately of people making false accusations of racism or discrimination for attention			1
i think you should just admit you did this yourself because you were mad he did n't tip you ... this poor man is innocent and i think you are racist against white people			2
' strange behavior : miss @entity30 ( pictured ) said the couple who left the racist comment were acting odd and simply ordered their food in to - go boxes before quickly leaving the restaurant others have sprung to the server 's defense stating that she would have been unlikely to have ' faked ' a restaurant receipt knowing that it would be scrutinized by her close friends and possibly the media			1
one observant poster noted that the two words appeared to be in different handwriting styles with the ' n ' capitalised on one line , but not on the other			0
the letter ' e ' also looked to be different in each of the words			0
nonetheless , miss @entity30 , who works two and half days each week at @entity3 , has continued to stand by her story , and has encouraged friends and acquaintances to ' share ' her shocking insult .			2
