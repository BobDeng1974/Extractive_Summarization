one step forward , one step back			0
no sooner had the @entity0 ended a run of three consecutive defeats than they were forced to confirm that their @entity5 flanker had a knee operation on thursday and will miss the autumn internationals			1
@entity0 director of rugby , @entity15 , revealed : ‘ @entity16 ’s had a screw taken out of his knee that was irritating the joint			2
he ’s probably six weeks away from playing			2

’ @entity22 of @entity0 runs in for the opening try against @entity24 at @entity25 @entity26 winger @entity22 slides under the posts to score the first try of the @entity30 match @entity6 has long been blighted by injuries			1
the @entity32 missed almost the whole of last season after suffering serious knee damage			0
he was side - lined for half of the previous campaign after major neck surgery			0
short bursts of activity are being interrupted by long spells of recuperation			0
it is a worrying pattern for the 28 - year - old			0
@entity0 already had a long injury list , so the loss of another key man is the last thing @entity15 needed			1
for @entity5 , @entity6 becomes the latest absentee up front , joining the likes of @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56			2
this injury bulletin overshadowed a vital win for the embattled @entity0			1
it was n’t pretty or emphatic , but the result was all that mattered			0
they had circled the wagons in the run - up to this match , amid tough questions about @entity15 ’s regime , and the siege mentality produced the desired outcome			2
they tightened their game to suit the grim conditions and a dominant pack saw them through			0
@entity22 ’s early try set the nervous home side on their way and the boot of @entity78 , though erratic at times , contributed the other 17 points			1
@entity83 ’ tactical kicking turned the screw on @entity24 , @entity81 excelled at full back and the @entity0 were particularly well served by several forwards , led by man of the match @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89			1
@entity90 of @entity24 kicks over @entity0 fly - half @entity83 as @entity92 watches on @entity0 director of rugby @entity15 patrols the touchline of the @entity97 ground the immediate upshot is that @entity0 — who came in on the back of defeats to @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104 — climbed three places to seventh in the table and avoided a first four - game losing run for a decade			1
yet , this meant more than just four league points			0
there was palpable relief at @entity25 as the @entity0 did enough to stop the rot and , potentially , generate vital confidence ahead of next week ’s start of the new @entity116			1
@entity15 said : ‘ i ’m happy for the players and for the club as a whole			0
we ’ve stuck together and this relieves the pressure a bit			0
but it ’s not all fixed yet ; it ’s just one game			0
hopefully , we have come through the other side , but we ’ll see in the next few weeks			0
’ @entity0 went ahead with a fourth - minute try , courtesy of a slick counter-attack			1
@entity130 and @entity131 combined to send @entity88 clear out wide and the flanker drew the last defender before releasing @entity22 to scorch clear and round to the posts			2
@entity78 and @entity90 engaged in a kicking duel for the bulk of a disjointed game until @entity24 rallied with a late try			1
nine minutes from time , the visitors sent a penalty to the left corner , won the lineout , drove repeatedly infield and @entity144 stepped through a gap to score			2
@entity90 converted and that was enough to snatch a bonus point			1
@entity24 boss @entity148 said : ‘ we got stuck in the middle of the pitch and they won the kicking contest			2
we did n’t play in the right areas of the pitch and our lineout did n’t function			0
