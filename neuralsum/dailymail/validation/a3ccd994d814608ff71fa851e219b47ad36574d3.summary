the @entity0 are confident the @entity2 semi-final between @entity3 and @entity4 will draw a much larger television audience than @entity6 ’ s @entity8 trip to @entity9 after revealing the matches will clash			1
just 10 minutes separate the kick - off times of two of the biggest games this season , with the @entity2 encountering an awkward conflict on what is supposed to be a standout weekend for the competition			1
@entity3 face @entity4 at @entity20 on saturday april 18 at 5.20pm for a place in the @entity2 final , with @entity9 hosting @entity6 at @entity23 at 5.30pm the same evening in a hugely important @entity8 encounter			1
@entity25 competes with @entity26 during the @entity8 match at @entity28 @entity29 faces @entity30 with points on the line for the title race and @entity35 spots much of the build - up to that slot will focus on @entity29 facing @entity30 , with points on the line for the title race and @entity35 qualification			0
@entity3 ’s game against @entity42 may play second fiddle in the eyes of many neutral football fans			0
but @entity0 sources insist viewing figures for their match , broadcast on the @entity49 , will far outstrip the @entity8 contest shown on @entity51			0
@entity6 v @entity3 in the @entity2 quarter - finals managed peak figures of 8.9million people			1
the terrestrial advantage in this battle is highly significant			0
@entity3 players celebrate after beating @entity58 in the @entity2 final at @entity20 last year @entity61 players salute their fans after they earned an @entity2 replay against @entity64 the @entity49 had first pick of the semi-finals and elected for the time and day that is likely to yield their greatest tv audience			2
the scheduling of the @entity8 match would not feature heavily among considerations			0
@entity73 picked up @entity74 ’s semi-final against either @entity64 or @entity61 and that will kick - off at 3pm on sunday april 19			2
it does mean an trickier trip home by train for northern supporters than a saturday fixture would have represented , but it is understood @entity83 were reluctant to have @entity64 and @entity6 fans potentially travelling to and from @entity85 at similar times			0
many supporters ran on to the pitch after watching @entity4 beat @entity89 to book an @entity2 semi-final spot @entity74 fans celebrate victory on the pitch after beating @entity94 in the @entity2 sixth round			1
