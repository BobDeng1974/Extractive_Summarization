by @entity0 published : 07:38 est , 24 july 2013 updated : 07:44 est , 24 july 2013 @entity2 art students have designed a bike helmet made from old newspapers to provide cheap and accessible head protection for people using @entity7 to navigate the capital			1
the students , from the @entity10 , hope that their disposable and eco-friendly helmets will one day be available in vending machines and shops close to @entity15 bike stations			1
the paper - mache hats cost just £ 1 to produce and is waterproof for six hours , but it is not known how effective it would be in a collision			1
a group of students has come up with a design to make bike helmets out of @entity2 newspapers - at a cost of just £ 1 to produce the students came up with the idea after noticing the number of discarded newspapers around the capital and decided that recycled paper , converted into paper mache , would be the most practical material for their disposable helmets the students came up with the idea after noticing the number of discarded newspapers around the capital and decided that recycled paper , converted into paper mache , would be the most practical material for their disposable helmets			1
@entity38 , 25 , @entity39 , 28 and @entity40 , 25 , began thinking about the safety of @entity2 cyclists having noticed people spontaneously using @entity15 bikes never carried head protection			2
in their design , the discarded newspaper is turned into pulp mixed with adhesive and pigment before it is vacuum formed and heated to resemble the shape of helmet			0
straps can then be slotted into the grooves on the helmet 's criss - crossed top before being fastened under the chin			2
the discarded newspaper is turned into pulp mixed with adhesive and pigment before it is vacuum formed and heated to resemble the shape of helmet the designers say these helmets can withstand a significant amount of pressure and hope that one day they will be available in vending machines and nearby shops next to @entity15 bike stations as well as locations such as @entity72 where the idea has recently been rolled out to mixed reviews			1
each helmet will cost under £ 1 to produce , will comply with @entity77 safety standards and , by using the same eco additive used to produce @entity80 wash bowls , will be fully waterproof for in excess of six hours			2
however they have not been tested in a collision			0
designer @entity38 said : ' the idea to use paper pulp came about through standing around on tube platforms , sitting in buses and trains watching @entity90 and @entity91 newspapers blow around			0
the students , from the @entity10 , hope that their disposable and eco-friendly helmets will one day be available in vending machines and shops close to @entity15 bike stations ' we had previously seen what kind of structural integrity could be gained from moulding paper pulp and it seemed like a logical step to use this vast resource that currently circulates our public transport network			1
' unlike the recycling of newspapers into new newspaper , which requires a lot of energy and bleaching in order to get the paper white enough again to print on , making helmets requires no artificial additives			0
' the students said that by using the same waterproofing agent as used to make paper pulp wash bowls and buckets as well as natural dyes , they can produce the recyclable and biodegradable helmets for under £ 1 , using very little energy			1
straps can then be slotted into the grooves on the helmet 's criss - crossed top before being fastened under the chin , as pictured			0
the designers say these helmets can withstand a significant amount of pressure mr @entity38 said : ' our current helmets are 2mm thick which already provides an amazing amount of strength and impact absorption , but the next prototype we are working on with an industrial partner we will be able to produce a helmet that is 9mm thick			1
' our overriding concept for the helmet is for it to be distributed in conjunction with the @entity143 hire scheme , with the price include in the hire of the bike			0
' we agree that people should have a choice to use a helmet , but we do believe from the research that we have gathered that you are much better of wearing one , even if its 25 per cent more effective than not wearing one			2
' twenty five per cent is something all of us would like to take			0
we believe that if the helmet is included in the price of the hire people are more likely to wear it			0

art students in @entity2 have designed a disposable paper mache helmet to provide cheap and accessible head protection for people using @entity7
the students , from the @entity10 , hope their disposable and eco-friendly helmets will come as part the bike rental
the helmet is a prototype and costs just £ 1 to make
the designers say it can withstand a significant amount of pressure - but admit they do *n't* know how effective it would be in a crash
