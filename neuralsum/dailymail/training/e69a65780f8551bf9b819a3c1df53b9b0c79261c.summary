by @entity0 a space cannon that will blast a hole into an asteroid to find out the origins of the universe has been tested by @entity7 scientists			1
the device will be used to gather data about the composition of the asteroid , named @entity11 , and help investigate how water and life were created on @entity14			0
the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) said the successful test has paved the way for a launch of the space cannon as early as next year			1
he successful test has paved the way for a launch of the cannon next year the space cannon will be flown on board the @entity23 towards the asteroid , which orbits between @entity14 and @entity25			1
once it arrives at the asteroid in 2018 , @entity32 will observe the entire surface of the asteroid using a variety of remote - sensing instruments			2
the spacecraft will then release a small lander called @entity38 and a rover named @entity40 2 on the asteroid 's surface to explore the surface in more detail			2
once it arrives at the asteroid in 2018 , @entity32 will observe the entire surface of the asteroid using a variety of remote - sensing instruments @entity40 means falcon in @entity7			1
hayabusa 2 is a successor to @entity15 's earlier asteroid explorer @entity32 , which returned the first asteroid samples to @entity14 in june 2010			0
hayabusa 2 is the third mission to land on an asteroid			0
@entity57 's @entity56 mission was the first mission to touchdown on an @entity58 is the second asteroid sample - return mission			0
the space cannon will , following this initial analysis , detach itself and remotely fire a 4lb metal projectile into the surface of the @entity11 asteroid			1
a probe will then land and collect debris samples from the impact to bring back to @entity14			0
scientists are intrigued by @entity69 as it is thought to have been altered very little since the formation of the solar system			1
@entity7 researchers hope to find water and organic material from the early solar system in the material collected			1
the space cannon will detach and remotely fire a 4lb metal projectile into the surface of the miniature planet this data could shed light on how planets form and life arises			1
the asteroid is currently scheduled to be blasted in 2018 and the probe will make its back to @entity14 by the end of the decade			0
@entity32 is the second project from @entity7 to recover particles from deep space			2
it builds on the success of @entity32 , which in gathered surface dust from an asteroid and returned to @entity14 in 2010			2
the asteroid is currently scheduled to be blasted in 2018 and the probe will make its back to @entity14 by the end of the decade			0
the data could shed light on how planets form and life arises .			0

@entity7 scientists said the launch of the space cannon will be next year
it will be flown on board the @entity23 towards the asteroid
the cannon will fire a 4lb metal projectile into the surface of the asteroid
