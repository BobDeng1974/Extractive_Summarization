by @entity0 published : 21:22 est , 18 december 2012 updated : 04:02 est , 19 december 2012 gardening shows on television are to blame for a rise in evictions of allotment holders as they make caring for a plot look ' too easy '			1
shows such as @entity9 has led to many people taking on allotments without realising the hard work needed to grow vegetables , experts say			2
this has seen waiting time in some councils increase to over a decade , while existing tenants are neglecting their plots			2
easy work ? television gardening shows such as @entity21 's @entity20 on @entity22 have been blamed for making gardening look too easy local councils are now increasingly cracking down on neglected patches - dubbed ' dirty plots ' - by issuing notices warning tenants to clean up their plots or risk losing them			1
@entity31 from the @entity32 said growing waiting lists are putting further pressure on local authorities to evict lazy gardeners			2
she added : ' there have been more non-cultivation letters issued this year because of the weather and people taking allotments unaware of the work and skills involved			0
' around 87,000 people were on council allotment waiting lists last year , with an average waiting time of three years , @entity45 said			1
however , the total number could be close to 200,000 as 150,000 plots owned by parish and town councils , public bodies and private allotment associations were excluded from the survey			2
long wait : nearly 200,000 people could be on waiting lists for allotments as 150,000 plots owned by non-council organisations were excluded from the survey in @entity63 , 1,070 such notices have been issued in the past year - covering over a third of the council 's plots in a hope that a drastic crackdown will speed up the 13 - year waiting list for the council 's 2,855 plots			1
a @entity63 council spokesman said : ' we carry out regular and rigorous inspections to ensure allotments are properly maintained and remain viable for future tenants			0
' all allotment holders are made aware of the need to cultivate their allotments when they sign their rental agreement			0
' similarly , @entity84 's @entity83 has issued 378 notices to quit - in respect of almost a third of its 1,364 plots			0
growing pains : allotment tenants face a harsh truth when they discover that growing vegetables is not as easy as @entity93 and the team on @entity9 make it look and allotment holders with untended plots in @entity98 , @entity99 , have also been warned to ' use them or lose them ' in a bid to improve an eight - year waiting list			1
@entity103 has framed its tenancy agreements so that holders can be evicted if they fail to keep their plot ' clean and free from weeds and well manured and otherwise maintain it in a good state of cultivation '			0
one of the council 's allotment reps , @entity111 , complained : ' people see these gardening programmes that make it look easy			1
it 's not like that			0
' they get very depressed when they see the weeds and they abandon it			0
' @entity121 , chairman of @entity122 , said the summer 's bad weather had seen many amateur gardeners abandoning their plots			0
' people think allotments are easy to maintain but it 's been a bad year weather-wise and people have got disheartened and not bothered doing their plots			1
