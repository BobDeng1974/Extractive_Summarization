@entity1 's radical plans to create the world 's first state - run marijuana marketplace could be jeopardy following yesterday 's presidential election @entity6 was elected president for the second time in a decade , continuing the leftist coalition ’s rule in the @entity11 nation			1
his win is a show of support for the leftist coalition that has governed the country for the past decade and ought to secure the government ’s radical marijuana plans			1
however , with polls showing that most @entity1 oppose the marijuana laws and want them repealed , and @entity6 ’s promise to proceed with the plan unless it produced negative results , the project might be at risk			1
cheer and fear : it is feared that the re-election of @entity6 , pictured after winning the presidential elections yesterday , may put the plan to create the world 's first state - run marijuana marketplace at risk during his first run as president from 2005 to 2010 , @entity6 governed as a relatively cautious moderate , avoiding the constitutional changes and polarization that have shaken countries such as @entity41			1
@entity6 , a 74 - year - old oncologist , topped centre - right rival @entity42 of the @entity43 53 percent to 40 percent in sunday 's vote			2
during his campaign , @entity42 criticized the marijuana plan , saying he would shut down the state - run pot market , while allowing domestic cultivation of the plant			1
the law was voted through under current president @entity52 , a former guerrilla known for his humble lifestyle and straight talk			2
both @entity6 and @entity55 belong to the @entity57 coalition , which has been in power for a decade and has passed laws same - sex marriage , abortion and marijuana			1
winner : @entity6 , a 74 - year - old oncologist , topped center - right rival @entity42 of the @entity43 53 percent to 40 percent in sunday 's presidential vote same - same , but different : even though current president @entity52 , right , and president elect @entity6 , belong to the same left - leaning coalition that has moved to create the world 's first state - run marijuana marketplace , the pair are known to have clashed within the party not so pro : the pro-marijuana laws were passed in may this year , but the implementation is going slower than the government planned , and polls how that 60 per cent of @entity1 oppose them this time around , @entity55 's popularity and a strong economy helped propel @entity6 into office , where he is now seen as the candidate of continuity , not of change			1
@entity6 , who starts his new term on march 1 , has at times clashed with @entity55 within the coalition			0
the president - elect cuts a much more sober figure than @entity55 , who still drives around in his beat - up @entity89 and is known as ' the world 's poorest president ' , and the marijuana law , his landmark initiative , may face an uncertain future in @entity6 's hands			1
under the law , the first of its kind in the world , marijuana users were supposed to be able to choose a supply source - pharmacies , cannabis clubs or home - grown plants - and buy or grow the drug in a regulated , fully legal market			2
@entity6 , who made strict anti-tobacco legislation one of his top priorities in his first term , has spoken out forcefully against smoking pot , called the idea of pharmacy sales ' incredible ' and said that if elected he would make ' any corrections necessary ' to the law			0
there are also other threats against the law , with recent polls showing that despite its international popularity , more than 60 per cent @entity1 oppose the marijuana laws and want them repealed			2
@entity122 : after the law was first voted through , pro-marijuana campaigners partied in the streets of @entity126 @entity1 authorities are still in the process of rolling out the pot marketplace , and although the law went into effect in may , it will not become reality until after @entity6 takes office			2
just last week it was announced that the implementation of the marijuana law is progressing slower than the @entity55 government had planned			0
last wednesday , the @entity138 said @entity1 could start selling marijuana in pharmacies in march , although the government had initially been aiming for year - end			0
@entity55 's marijuana legislation allows each household to register to grow up to six plants while users inscribed into an official list may buy up to 40 grams per person a month at pharmacies			0
the number of people registered to be allowed to grow cannabis at home has jumped to 1,200 from 600 a month ago as fears have eased that the conservative opposition might win the vote and derail the legislation			0
the reform is being followed closely across @entity155 where the legalization or decriminalization of some narcotics is increasingly viewed as a better way to end the violence spawned by drug trafficking than the @entity163 - led ' war on drugs			0
' @entity1 is one of @entity155 's most liberal societies and smoking marijuana has been legal since 1998			0
it estimates it has some 150,000 recreational smokers .			0
