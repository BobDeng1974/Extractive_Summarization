by @entity0 published : 04:27 est , 10 august 2012 updated : 05:04 est , 10 august 2012 it is a strange and bizarre sight , and one that has astonished scientists			0
researchers from the @entity6 in @entity7 have revealed one of the oddest spiders ever discovered			2
the @entity10 is the first eyeless huntsman spider in the world			1
@entity10 , a unique spider with no eyes that was found in a cave in @entity15			1
scientists believed it developed after living in caves with no daylight			1
with a leg span of only six centimetres and a body size of around twelve millimetres , the spider @entity10 is certainly not one of the largest representatives of the huntsman spiders , which include more than 1100 species			2
however , it is the first of its kind in the world without any eyes			0
' i found the spider in a cave in @entity15 , around 100 kilometres away from the famous @entity34 cave , ' said @entity35 , head of the arachnology section at the @entity6 in @entity7			1
' we already knew of spiders of this genus from other caves , but they always had eyes and complete pigmentation			0
' @entity10 is the first huntsman spider without eyes			1
' the accompanying study has been published by the scientific journal @entity48			0
the team believe the regression of the eyes is attributable to living permanently without daylight			1
this adaptation was also observed in other cave - dwelling spider species by the @entity7 arachnologist			2
' the @entity57 species described demonstrate all kinds of transitions to cave adaptation – from eight functioning eyes to forms with six , four and two lenses , right up to blind spiders , ' said @entity66 spiders are in good company : fish , scorpions and crabs that have adapted to caves have already been found in the caves of @entity15			1
the spider has a body around 12mm long , and a legspan of 6cm in total , the @entity7 spider researchers have described nine new species of the genus @entity57			0
the fact that all of the species have been found in caves confirms the animals ’ preference for underground habitats			0
because of the small - scale area in which the spider species can be found it is possible to study their adjustment to the cave as a dwelling – the number of eyes present and the visual faculty may possibly shed light on the time of settlement			2
' furthermore , the spiders can be used as indicators for the threat to their habitats , ' said @entity35			0
' these are often endangered by tourism or the exploitation of the limestone rocks to make cement			0
' the eyeless huntsman spider was named after the @entity112 company “ @entity110 ” that makes headlamps for caves .			1
