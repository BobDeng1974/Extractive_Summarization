by @entity0 published : 05:24 est , 15 december 2012 updated : 09:42 est , 15 december 2012 looking out over the @entity2 wilderness , balanced only on a two ince wide piece of wire suspended between two rock outcrops			1
for some this is a nightmare scary enough to make you wake up in a cold sweat			0
but to others it is all in a day 's work			0
these pictures show four thrill - seekers as they walk the line , risking life and limb on a highline stretched 80ft wide and anchored 100ft in the air between two rock outcrops in the @entity20 wilderness , in northern @entity2			1
what a view : @entity22 of @entity23 , @entity2 , walks across a slackline 100ft high over the @entity20 wilderness scary moment : @entity26 tries to land a trick jump but misses the landing amazing balance : fortunately the highliners are tethered on to the wire in case they are ever failed by their sublime skill in these pictures , highliners @entity26 , @entity22 , @entity36 and @entity37 , all from @entity2 , masterfully show the sport off in all its glory			1
one of the images however shows the heart - stopping moment @entity43 attempts to land a trick jump but misses his footing			1
fortunately participants of the highlining are tethered to the line so that they do n't fall			0
@entity49 is a form of slacklining , which is the art of balancing on two inch wide nylon webbing tensioned between to points			2
the sport is similar to walking a tightrope , only the webbing used in highlining has more slack			0
@entity20 is situated on the county line between the @entity62 and @entity63 counties in the northern @entity65 region of the state of @entity2			2
careful chaps : @entity43 , left , recovers from failing to land his attempted trick jump , while to the untrained eye at least @entity22 does n't look too comfortable on the wire tough as old boots : @entity37 's feet look like they have become used to the demands of a highliner the major attraction of the town , which has a population of 10,031 , is its red sandstone formations , known as the @entity79 of @entity20			1
the rocks appear to glow in brilliant orange and red when illuminated by the rising or setting sun and are the home to activities ranging from extreme sports to spiritual pursuits			0
rope walking has been around in various forms for thousands of years , but the origin of slacklining is usually attributed to rock climbers @entity92 and @entity94 from their time at @entity97 's @entity96 in 1979			0
watchful eye : @entity100 the dog looks on as @entity36 walks across the slackline in @entity2			2

thrill - seekers walk across two inch wire 100ft above the @entity2 *desert*
amazing pictures show the true skill needed in taking on such a feat
picture shows heart - stopping moment one fails to land a trick jump
