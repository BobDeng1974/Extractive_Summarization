if you 've ever dreamed of getting away from it all with your own slice of paradise for idyllic holidays , then look no further			0
@entity6 - located just near the @entity7 - has a setting as beautiful as it is private and it has just gone on sale with a starting price of £ 10,000			1
but you 'll need to be happy to rough it as there are no modern amenities of any kind and it is barely the size of half a football pitch			1
in the middle of the water to the left of the chimney on the left side of this cottage you find @entity6 a rocky , grass - covered tidal island near the north - west tip of @entity27 's @entity7 , close to the quaint village @entity29 , it may also be the best chance for many of us to own our own private island			1
listing agent @entity35 ' senior vice president @entity34 confirmed @entity6 could sell for as little as £ 10,000 despite describing the opportunity to own it as ' very special '			1
' with this kind of island it is very hard to say what is the right price , ' @entity34 says of the space of about 164 by 82 feet			1
' to own your own island is very special			2
' ' the right value is the right value			0
between £ 10,000 and £ 50,000 is my feeling			1
' the tiny island off @entity7 that is half the size of a football pitch could sell for as little as £ 10,000 size and proximity are two factors driving the price down , as is the fact the property has no planning permission for any form of structure beyond the remnants of a fort that can be seen only with the keenest eyes			1
@entity62 was once connected to the shore by a causeway and listing agent @entity35 say it 's still possible to walk to from the mainland at the lowest tide			0
local attractions include @entity70 , on the other hand , is an unusual miniature landscape of grassy , cone - shaped hills and a turret shaped rock called @entity77 's castle the island has some kitsch appear though , as 20 years ago it was given away as a prize on a @entity82 tv programme @entity83 ( my show )			1
winner @entity87 , from near @entity86 , was 20 at the time and while he initially said he was keen to build a house there to ' enjoy the view ' it 's not known if he even even visited the island before it was put up for sale			1
on winning the island in 1994 , mr @entity87 is quoted in the @entity97 saying : ' i am very happy , very excited			2
i am jumping in the air			0
' i know you have the @entity101 , whisky , bagpipes , and nice scenery but that is all i know			0
but all that is going to change			0
' the small island has no structures or approval to add any , but boasts tranquility and stunning surrounds he added : ' i have seen photographs of my island			2
i am told it is easy to get to in a small boat			0
' i am much looking forward to it			0
maybe i can build a small house on the island and sit and admire the view			2
' @entity35 ' portfolio includes deluxe islands befitting the rich and famous in the @entity122 and the @entity123 , but does n't have a lot to say about @entity6			2
' a rocky structure , covered by grass ; attentive owners may even find the remains of a fort if they look closely enough , ' their promotional material states , before going on to wax lyrical about its surrounds			0
singers perform on the @entity82 tv show , @entity83 , which gave @entity6 away as a prize in 1994 ' the village of @entity29 is located close to this island for sale , offering nice walks which take in waterfalls , woodlands and cliff - tops too , ' it says			1
' @entity146 , on the other hand , is an unusual miniature landscape of grassy , cone - shaped hills and a turret shaped rock called @entity77 's castle			0
' visitors that come to this region near the @entity7 will be spoiled by good restaurants , a lively bar , hotels , bed and breakfast accommodation , a campsite , shops , a petrol station , and much more			2
furthermore the village is served by an excellent transport network , which comprises of boat trips , a ferry service to the @entity168 and a local and mainland bus service			0
