looking lean and healthy and sporting something of a @entity3 look , @entity0 signed on for his first official engagement as @entity7 ’s @entity6 captain			1
there are 550 days to go before @entity0 takes his golfing monument men to @entity10 to try to bring back the trophy — and many of those days will be filled with the sort of media engagements that occupied his time at the @entity16 at @entity18 ’s @entity17			1
no doubt @entity0 may struggle for something to say on occasion but that was not the case here as he spoke about @entity23 and other pertinent matters , including one surprising comment regarding the @entity6			1
@entity0 will captain @entity7 at next year 's @entity6 in @entity26 the former @entity28 champion holds aloft the trophy on his first official appointment as captain after the comprehensive win at @entity34 last time in 2014 , the overwhelming temptation must be to keep everything the same but @entity0 is considering one small change to the blueprint			1
he plans to study the data on wildcards in the tournament before deciding whether to recommend cutting their number from three to two			1
of course , there are arguments both ways			2
he might leave himself short of options if too many of the top players fail to qualify automatically but there is an equally compelling case for saying the man finishing in 10th spot deserves to make the team by right			0
even this far out @entity0 is unequivocal , however , about who will be the team leader — it just has to be @entity23			1
@entity0 has known the 25 - year - old ulsterman since before @entity23 was even a teenager			1
‘ @entity23 always was special as a kid and a golfer , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ he was different from everyone else and still is			0
’ @entity0 has backed his compatriot @entity23 to complete his grand slam of all four majors the world no 1 travels to @entity66 in a fortnight needing only the @entity64 to complete his set the skipper is excited to see how @entity23 fares at the masters next month but is adamant about one thing : @entity23 will complete the career @entity75 one day			1
‘ if he does n’t win it this year , he will win it next year , ’ he said			2
‘ he ’s just too good not to win it , with all his gifts and on a course made for his game			0
’ what sort of captain will @entity0 be ? given his emotional personality , it is hardly surprising he picks out the @entity6 ships run by @entity88 and @entity89			1
‘ @entity89 once said to me that playing in the @entity6 is like having your first child , that you really ca n’t describe it until you ’ve gone through it , and that ’s always stuck with me , ’ he said			1
‘ i was fortunate enough to experience the pressure of contending for a major and coming through to win , but for me the pressure of the @entity6 was far greater			1
‘ and i will be a player - friendly captain			2
some might think i ’m too close to the players but i will not shirk my responsibilities			0
’ @entity0 is keen to foster that community feeling that marked @entity102 ’s team in 2014 and one or two earlier incarnations			1
‘ it was interesting seeing that from the outside at @entity34 , ’ he said			0
‘ i was working for @entity107 but that togetherness was still so easy to see and clearly so beneficial			0
’ players celebrate with former captain @entity102 after winning the @entity6 at @entity34 last year @entity0 had a well - publicised falling out with @entity102 but , thankfully , both are keen to present a united public front			1
‘ of course i will be taking up his offer to talk with him , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ @entity102 could n’t have done a better job so it would be foolish not to talk			0
i intend to speak to all the captains			0
how can that not be a help ? ’ the first day in a new job can often be a nervous one but @entity0 was composed and confident , and enjoyed some light - hearted football banter			1
after sir @entity121 ’s motivational talk at glen - eagles , would clarke the @entity124 fan ask keen golfer @entity125 to speak in @entity26 , given he will be playing in @entity126 by then ? ‘ after yesterday , what a time to ask me that ! ’ he said			0
what price @entity128 pulling out of the @entity64 next week just as he did last year ? whatever happens , it is guaranteed already to be another sad landmark in his startling fall from grace			2
now down to 96th in the world , @entity128 is certain next monday to fall out of the top 100 for the first time since october 13 , 1996			0
@entity128 is set to fall out of the top 100 for the first time since october 1996 ‘ i have a dislocated shoulder and it has been keeping me out of the gym , which is disappointing			2
i want to stay fit because			0
well , i shall be old one of these days			0
’ @entity137 holding court as tournament host last week			0
now 85 , the great man promised that not even a dislocated shoulder would prevent him from hitting the ceremonial first tee shot at the masters			2
in the words of the old @entity146 song , may he stay forever young			0
@entity137 ( right ) presents @entity147 with the trophy after winning the @entity149 in @entity150 there is a fine line separating @entity153 in 49th place in the world rankings from @entity156 in 51st but right now it is making a huge difference			0
one is heading to the masters in a fortnight ’s time while the other is not			2
that could all change , however , following the @entity28 this week			1
anyone inside the top 50 after this event will get an invitation to @entity66 and while @entity156 has secured a prized sponsor ’s invitation , @entity153 has decided to stay at home in @entity170			1
@entity153 will be sweating on @entity156 's performance at the @entity28 to find his @entity64 fate what price @entity174 , on a straight - shooter ’s course that ought to suit his eye , tipping the @entity177 out of the field for the season ’s first major ? it is to be hoped that both scrape in			2
under the ranking system , @entity153 is actually projected to move up a spot without taking the week ’s events into account ( proceedings at the @entity187 in @entity188 on the @entity189 could also influence matters )			0
so not just @entity156 but two other players would have to go past @entity153 to deny him a @entity64 outing			0
as for @entity156 , anything resembling the tied - 17th finish he achieved in his last start at @entity198 ’s @entity197 would do the trick			0
among those who could also force their way to @entity66 via their efforts in @entity188 are englishmen @entity203 ( 61st ) and @entity205 ( 66th ) .			2

@entity0 will captain @entity7 at the @entity6 next year
@entity208 is considering cutting wildcards from three to two
former @entity28 winner is sure that @entity23 will complete grand slam
@entity214 1 only needs the masters at @entity66 for a full set of majors
