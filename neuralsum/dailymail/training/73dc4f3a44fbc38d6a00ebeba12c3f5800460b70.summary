@entity0 , who has publicly chastised the @entity1 , will say she wants to keep their country in the euro when she visits @entity4 this week @entity5 chancellor @entity0 will tell @entity1 she wants to keep their country in the euro when she visits @entity4 this week , but she faces a hostile reception from a people worn down by years of austerity and recession			1
many @entity1 blame @entity0 , who has publicly chastised them for much of the past three years , for the nation 's plight			1
opponents , some of whom have caricatured her as a bullying @entity15 , have promised protests on tuesday during her first visit to @entity1 since the euro zone crisis erupted there in 2009			1
' she does not come to support @entity1 , which her policies have brought to the brink			2
she comes to save the corrupt , disgraced and servile political system , " said @entity21 , who leads the opposition @entity23 alliance			0
" we will give her the welcome she deserves			0
' about 6,000 policemen will be deployed in the capital for her 6 - hour visit , turning the city centre into a no - go zone for protest marches planned by labour unions and opposition parties			2
' we do n't want her here , ' said @entity35 , 72 , who has seen his pension cut by one third			0
' we will take to the streets against austerity and against the government			0
maybe @entity0 will hear something and see what we 're going through			2
after toying with the idea of a @entity1 exit from the euro zone in the first half of 2012 , @entity0 has come full circle and decided the risks of the country leaving are too high , especially with a @entity5 election looming next year			1
the trip is a sign of @entity5 solidarity , a message to the @entity1 leadership and people that @entity75 does not want to cut them loose , and a signal to the members of @entity0 's coalition who want @entity1 out that it 's not going to happen soon			1
at the same time , the trip shows @entity0 's trust in @entity81			2
aides to the chancellor say they have been positively surprised by his commitment to reform			0
one reason for not visiting @entity1 before was frustration with progress under his predecessors , technocrat @entity91 and socialist @entity92			2
' in our view @entity55 is really trying to get things done , " one @entity5 official said , requesting anonymity			0
' nobody should see this trip as a sign that all is perfect			0
but we recognise things are moving in the right direction			0
' the @entity1 government was ecstatic about the news , promising to treat @entity0 with the honours befitting the leader of a great nation			1
@entity1 officials credited @entity55 's charm offensive in @entity75 in august for @entity5 's change of heart			2
' @entity55 showed a real will to change things , ' a @entity1 government official said			2
' he stressed what @entity1 had to do , not what others had to do for @entity1			2
' @entity0 is scheduled to meet @entity55 , president @entity119 and representatives of @entity1 industry			1
in a measure of tension between @entity4 and @entity75 earlier this year , @entity119 accused @entity0 's finance minister @entity124 of insulting the country by likening @entity1 to a bottomless pit			1
opposition parties , from the radical leftist @entity23 to the right - wing @entity128 , have planned protests - and police officials said they were bracing for violence			0
for years , banner headlines and cartoons in the press have portrayed @entity5 as a bully and protesters burned @entity15 effigies on the central @entity140 outside parliament			0
demonstrators in @entity4 carry a banner featuring pictures of @entity0 and @entity1 's former prime minister @entity92 during a day of strikes in may 2010 the tone was more subdued in the newspapers on sunday			1
to @entity149 ran a ' @entity151 ' headline but most others called on @entity0 to take a hard look at the suffering of @entity1 people during her visit			1
' tell merkel the truth , ' wrote @entity158 in @entity159			0
' with unemployment at 25 per cent and recession at 7 per cent , for a fifth year , can lenders expect the country to survive and pay back its debts ? ' the visit gives @entity0 a chance to get a first - hand view of a country that could have a major influence on her own re-election hopes			1
@entity1 is stuck in tough negotiations with inspectors from the ' troika ' of the @entity174 , @entity175 and @entity176 over a fresh wave of 11.5 billion euros in cuts for the next two years , a condition for getting an installment of the 130 billion euro bailout which is keeping the country afloat			1
as difficult as these talks are , lenders are now realising @entity1 needs more time , money or both			2
the @entity174 wants official lenders such as @entity5 to take a ' haircut ' under which the value of the @entity1 debt they hold would be radically reduced			0
private bondholders have already swallowed such a hit but @entity195 partners prefer other measures than to suffer more losses			0
in order to avoid going back to parliament to request a third rescue for @entity4 - a step @entity0 allies acknowledge could be political suicide for her - @entity5 will probably have to agree to other concessions to plug a hole in @entity1 's finances			1
@entity0 meets @entity1 's prime minister @entity55 in @entity75			1
her visit on tuesday will be her first to @entity1 since the euro zone crisis erupted these could include giving @entity55 an extra two years to make painful cuts and agreeing to a reduction in the interest rates @entity4 pays on its @entity195 loans			1
before making concessions that are sure to provoke a backlash at home , @entity0 will want to look @entity55 in the eye and make clear to him that she has done all she can - that it is now up to him			0
politically , she will have next to no room to give the @entity1 more before next year 's @entity5 vote			0
' she has to lay it on the line and make clear to the @entity1 government what the options are , ' @entity222 , a senior lawmaker in @entity0 's @entity223 ( @entity224 ) told @entity230			1
' whether the conditions for additional help are met depends not on @entity5 , but on the @entity1 government alone			0
' video : thousands of police on guard to protect @entity0			0

first visit to @entity1 since the euro zone crisis in 2009
protests promised on tuesday by opponents
@entity0 will say she wants to keep @entity1 in the euro
