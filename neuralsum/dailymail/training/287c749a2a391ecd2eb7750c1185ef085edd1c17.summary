by @entity0 a mind reading helmet could allow military bosses to tell if new captured enemies are friend or foe , it has been claimed			1
the helmet is packed with sensors that monitor the wearer ’s brain activity through @entity12 scans			2
the @entity13 takes millions of these brain data points , and recognizes patterns that can distinguish ' friend ' from ' foe ' in near real - time			1
although the firm has refused to show off the device , is it claimed to be a futuristic motorcycle - type helmet containing metal brush sensors that will read brain activity			1
it works by flashing images of crime scenes or bomb specs in front of the wearer , then looking for tiny changes in the brain that have been found to correspond with recognition			1
when you recognize a picture that is of emotional significance to you , your brain experiences a 200 to 500 microsecond blip			0
the reaction , referred to as the @entity47 response , happens too fast for the test subject to control , so the subject ca n’t game the system			0

' if i flash you a picture of a diagram that shows you how to build an ied , that would be a pretty strong indicator that you might be a foe … you would n’t be studying how to make an ied if you were a friend , ' @entity75 ceo @entity74 told @entity77			1
earlier this week , rear adm. @entity78 told reporters that ' it would be imprudent , irresponsible not to think about the insider threat			0
' the threat is real in @entity83 as well where insider threats , so - called “ green - on - blue ” attacks , have killed several @entity87 troops in recent years			1
the frim envisions a scenario in which troops in a village in @entity83 round up all the men and put helmets on them , and then the soldiers will able to classify them as friend or foe almost instantly			2

however , they admit it could also be used in law enforcement , criminal trials , and corporate takeovers - and could even become a smartphone app giving anyone a mind - reading device in their pocket			0
' @entity57 ’s @entity120 captures brain signals in response to stimuli through multiple @entity124 ( @entity125 ) and @entity126 ( @entity126 ) readings , bookended by a @entity129 ( @entity128 ) and a @entity131 ( @entity132 ) , ' the firm says			2
' @entity120 can uncover loyalties , guilty knowledge , and deception , in order to vet intelligence sources , and can out think @entity138 in @entity83			0
the firm boasts is could even have caught the boston bomber			0
' upon his return from @entity145 , had the @entity146 been screened by @entity57 ’s @entity120 , this neurotechnology would have identified him as a potential threat , ' it claims			0
