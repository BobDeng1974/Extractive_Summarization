the @entity6 mayor personally vetoed the campaign , which was due to start next week , because he said it suggested gay people can be cured			1
the @entity3 adverts , which mimic an initiative by pro-gay group @entity15 , were intended to advertise ' gay conversion ' through therapy			1
offensive : the advert by @entity20 was due to run on @entity6 buses for two weeks before it was pulled @entity1 was said to have intervened himself as chair of @entity22 when he became aware of the controversial campaign , which mimicked a previous @entity15 initiative ( right ) is @entity1 right to ban posters suggesting gays have an illness ? but after being alerted to the plans , the @entity30 mayor took immediate steps to halt the ' offensive ' campaign , which he said had no place in a tolerant city			1
