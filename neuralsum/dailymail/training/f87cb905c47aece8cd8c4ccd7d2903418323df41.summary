they will also be invited to an event that will include a live link - up with @entity5 during his stay on the @entity8 ‘ this is a great opportunity to get people thinking about nutrition and healthy eating , ’ @entity37 said			1
‘ i ’m really excited that i ’ll be able to eat a “ @entity42 ” onboard the space station and for me it will be a very special link back to planet earth ! ’ ‘ i think that by blending the creativity from the competition and @entity28 ’s expertise we can produce something that is not just fun , healthy and tasty but also food that will be really important for the future of space travel			1

@entity37 , 41 , said : ‘ the @entity8 is a cutting edge research laboratory that is pushing the boundaries of what is scientifically , technically and humanly possibly			0
‘ my six month stay onboard mankind 's outpost in space is going to be both challenging and incredibly exciting			0
‘ the scientific experiments conducted will be wide ranging , covering areas such as medicine , human physiology , core science and material science			0
' the winning entry , which has yet to be announced , will be incorporated into a logo			0
@entity37 told @entity98 that food on the @entity8 was not as ' nice as it could be ' and while it is nutritious , it is often ' lacks taste and texture '			1

mr @entity28 said : ‘ i ’m unbelievably excited to be designing a delicious meal for @entity10 to enjoy in space ; there are some real challenges ahead , things are n’t quite the same up there ! ‘ i ’m really looking forward to seeing some incredible suggestions by the kids , and getting started on creating something that @entity10 will love up there in space			1
’ lots of the food that is sent to the @entity8 is dehydrated and packed in vacuum bags so it is small and light			2
the crew mix up their food with water and often suck it straight out of the packets with straws			0
as well as lacking texture , the food often seems bland to astronauts as they lose their sense of smell and therefore their taste			0
this happens because blood flows to their heads in zero gravity and makes their faces swell up , blocking their noses			0
not renowned for its food : lots of the food that is sent to the @entity8 ( pictured ) is dehydrated and packed in vacuum bags so they are small and light			2

' as a former test - pilot i believe that knowledge is gained when we explore the boundaries of what is technically and humanly possible , ' @entity37 said			0
the winners of the competition will play a small part in @entity4 space history as @entity5 will become the first @entity4 astronaut to visit the @entity8 as well as the first official @entity193 in space			1
