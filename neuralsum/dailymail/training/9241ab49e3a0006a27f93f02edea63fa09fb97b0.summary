by @entity0 published : 13:48 est , 4 june 2012 updated : 02:07 est , 5 june 2012 one table is heaving with chargrilled vegetable vol - au - vents , free range egg quiche and salads of rocket , torn chicken breast and cherry tomatoes fresh from the vine , drizzled with lashings of olive oil			2
the other boasts shop - bought sausage rolls , cheese puffs , breadsticks , cucumber slices and salad cream , washed down with tins of @entity18 and cans of cola			2
perhaps unsurprisingly , it was the street party near the constituency home of @entity23 and @entity24 that offered the rather more upmarket fare on the third day of celebrations to toast @entity28 's jubilee celebrations			1
prime minister @entity29 along with his wife @entity30 attend the @entity32 street party , near their @entity34 home a street party to commemorate @entity37 at @entity38 , @entity39 the couple took their three children to the @entity43 in a quiet cul - de - sac in the @entity46 village of @entity32 , where delights such as red cabbage coleslaw and homemade mini-pizzas were on offer			1
mrs @entity24 , 41 , made a beeline for a salad of lamb ’s lettuce and crispy bacon , dishing up a portion for her husband , 45 , and then herself			0
afterwards the couple enjoyed cupcakes iced to look like the @entity59			0
have you taken any pictures of the @entity63 celebrations ? from the @entity65 to your town , we want to see them			0
send them for publication - with plenty of caption detail - to the @entity72 on the email address : @entity73 the event was in stark contrast to the more colourful street party laid on in the market town of @entity38 , @entity39			1
@entity79 tablecloths , cups , plates and balloons adorned the tables , which were piled with more conventional party snacks such as crisps , dips and ham sandwiches			2
these were apparently washed down with tins of @entity18 bitter , bottles of lager , glasses of white wine and paper cups of fizzy drinks			0
guests added to the colourful celebrations by wearing red , white and blue clothes – with some donning masks bearing the faces of members of the @entity102			0
in @entity34 , the party decorations amounted to a few more modest strings of bunting , and diners ignored the tables and chairs in favour of mingling by the gazebos			1
@entity113 parish councillor @entity112 , who has lived in the village for 12 years and was one of the event ’s organisers , said : ‘ everyone in the village made something and brought it along , resulting in an amazing display of food			2
‘ around 200 people came and although there were tables and chairs , people stood around talking to each other while enjoying the barbecue			0
‘ it was a wonderful day and it was nice to see the @entity132 because they do n’t spend so much time here now they are in @entity135			1
’ into the jubilee spirit : @entity29 helps himself to a cupcake as he attends a street party with his wife @entity30 in @entity113 , near their @entity34 home unlike yesterday , when rain put a dampener on his @entity135 party , mr @entity29 and his wife took advantage of the outdoors @entity113 celebrations @entity148 , the deputy prime minister , also got in on the act yesterday as he attended a street party in his constituency in @entity152			1
unlike yesterday , the rain held off this afternoon as mr @entity29 chatted with his constituents in the north @entity34 village			1
as well as commemorating the @entity63 , @entity29 also said the street party hosted by him and the thousands of others like it across @entity159 were a brilliant showcase of the @entity161 in action - which has been panned by critics for lacking real meaning			1
taking over the streets : police close the road through @entity168 , @entity169 , as hundreds of residents congregate for the festivities in far drier conditions than sunday awash with revellers : the residents of @entity168 , @entity169 , turn out en masse on row - upon - row of tables for the sun - filled celebrations sea of red , white and blue : the community in @entity38 , @entity39 , show their appreciation for the monarchy with a huge cheer for the camera cheers ! the residents of @entity38 decked themselves in all manner of jubilee paraphernalia as the celebrations took on a wholly patriotic feel community cohesion : @entity29 said the street party hosted by him and the thousands of others like it across @entity159 were a showcase of the @entity161 in action the prime minister said yesterday : ' we had a great street party , but inside @entity135 rather than outside			1
' we had elderly people , we had @entity203 , we had @entity204 , @entity205 , people who had been organising the @entity207			0
the oldest 96 , the youngest was four or five , so it was a great @entity161 occasion and a real pleasure to be able to host this			0
' the prime minister , who meets the @entity28 every week to discuss topical issues , said it was a ' huge treat ' to receive the benefit of her ' unparalleled ' knowledge of world events , which dates back to when @entity217 was prime minister			1
' she is an amazing listener but she also asks some really pertinent questions			0
' community spirit : @entity220 tuck into a selection of food of drink during a street party to mark the @entity63 in @entity225 , @entity226 hats on to the @entity28 ! seven - year - old @entity228 ( top ) and @entity230 , 5 , of @entity231 , @entity232 , go @entity79 crazy ( left ) , as does a reveller in @entity225 , @entity226 all smiles : residents in @entity225 enjoy the regal atmostphere			1
thousands of street parties were being held up and down the @entity159 as people took advantage of the first of two bank holidays the festivities were in full swing at the @entity245 street party in @entity246 , where more than 500 residents toasted the @entity28 in the long - awaited sunshine on a high : the @entity245 street party was given an added boost with the appearance of this @entity79 - waving woman on stilts just for laughs : a youngster enjoys the pomp and circumstance of the big celebrations during the @entity245 street party in @entity246 five - year - old @entity230 takes a cake from the table as residents of @entity231 in @entity232 sit down for their jubilee street party the original plan was for mr @entity29 to host the @entity135 party outside @entity266 , with guests sitting at trestle tables tucking in to jubilee fare			1
a big screen was set up , showing the @entity272 flotilla , and bunting adorned the front of @entity266 and @entity275			0
but with just hours to go until the start of the party , officials decided it was best to invite the 120 guests indoors to enjoy the specially decorated jubilee cup cakes and sandwiches in the warmth of the @entity285 room			2
no 10 spokesperson said : ' to celebrate the @entity63 , and as part of his duties as prime minister and an mp , @entity29 attended two street parties , one in @entity135 , the other in his constituency			1
' plant pots are decorated with masks of @entity28 and @entity296 , at the @entity297 in @entity298 , west @entity226 sweet treat : an intricately decorated party cake bearing all the hallmarks of @entity302 made for the @entity225 street celebrations in south @entity226 for someone who once described the monarchy as ' our most sordid soap opera ' , it may have come as some surprise to see @entity310 in the party spirit yesterday			1
the former mayor of @entity226 was out on the streets of @entity315 in the north - west of the capital , where he joined in the jubilee celebrations with the borough 's residents			2
it certainly seems a change of heart towards the @entity102 since making his views very publicly known in the past			0
is he a royal convert ? former mayor of london @entity310 greets a resident in @entity315 , north - west @entity226 as he joins in the jubilee celebrations having previously voiced his distaste for the monarchy for it was he who released 1,000 black balloons from @entity335 back in 1981 to ' mourn ' the wedding off prince @entity337 and @entity338			2
and in a newspaper interview in 1996 , he referred to the royals as ' our most sordid soap - opera ' which had been populated by ' not very bright … airheads in high heels '			0
when it was the turn of @entity346 and @entity296 to tie the knot , he did at least show some kind of turnaround by calling for free travel for all @entity351 to celebrate their happy day last year			0
whether his latest outing represents a full fledged u-turn remains to be seen .			0

prime minister and his wife attend street party in his constituency in @entity32 , @entity34 , this afternoon
he also celebrated @entity28 's *60* years on throne with a rain - *affected* indoor @entity135 party yesterday
