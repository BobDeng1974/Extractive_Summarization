by @entity0 published : 05:07 est , 3 june 2012 updated : 05:56 est , 3 june 2012 meet @entity1 - the tiny short tailed fruit bat abandoned by his mother just after he was born			1
luckily for the vulnerable little creature , he made his way to safety and was found curled up in a little ball in the flight enclosure at @entity9 , @entity10			1
his mother was yet another victim of zoo closures across the @entity12 and could not cope with the way she was treated			2
kept in dreadful conditions , the trauma of being captured and transferred to a new and unfamiliar environment caused her to be very stressed , and leave her young , @entity1			1
abandoned : @entity1 has been taken under a new wing at @entity9 in @entity10 @entity1 was taken in by the @entity9 and given the confidence he needed to fully develop without his mother			1
when the sanctuary first took him under their wing , he was warmed up , comforted and fed , then moved into an incubator so he would stay warm at all times			0
he quickly learned to nurse his milk formula from a foam tip and looked forward to feeding time			0
. @entity1 likes to rock himself back and forth after he has eaten and after he had groomed and also loves to groom his tiny body and stretch and flap his minuscule wings			1
vulnerable : short tailed fruit bat @entity1 was abandoned by his mother just after being born when @entity1 was old enough , he was slowly reintroduced back into the flight cage to be with other of bats of his own kind			2
he slept by day in the incubator , and was moved into a netted basket to spend his nights in the flight enclosure - to protect him and allow him to feel safe while getting to know the other bats			0
he was given practice flight lessons and within in a few weeks , the netting over the basket was lifted so he could fly in and out at will			0
@entity40 it : @entity42 shows off his tiny wing @entity1 now lives with his bat friends full time , and is a happy resident of the @entity46			2
fruit bats ( @entity48 ) can vary in size from around two to 16 inches long and have the best vision of all bat species			0
