after weeks of promotion , @entity0 and @entity1 finally come together in the most bitter of grudge matches and in an eliminator for the @entity6 world cruiserweight title			1
the build - up has made both fighters household names			2
we sold out the @entity11 in 48 hours , it 's the fastest - ever selling sporting event there and the pay - per - view numbers look really strong			2
i 've been nervous this week			2
we 've seen some grudge matches before but this is more bitter than i 've ever experienced			0
with @entity17 against @entity18 it was a case of , ' i ca n't stand that bloke , ' but this is more like , ' i want to finish him now			1
' @entity1 and @entity0 get set for their rematch at @entity23 's @entity11 on saturday both @entity1 and @entity0 weighed in in @entity23 ahead of their cruiserweight clash the atmosphere was n't pleasant at the press conference on thursday or up on stage at the weigh - in because it was very personal ; there were plenty of insults traded			1
i think @entity1 believes that @entity0 is using these insults because he 's desperate			1
to be honest , i thought @entity0 would lose his marbles more than he has but he â€™s been able to keep it together			1
obviously @entity0 will have the majority of the support with the fight being in @entity23 but i think this is the kind of event to which neutrals will come			1
if you are a neutral , you 'd probably favour @entity1 because he has kept himself to himself in the build - up			1
you 're more likely to have an opinion of @entity46			0
there is plenty of bad blood between the pair , who have fought on one previous occasion security step in as things get heated on stage at the weigh in for saturday 's fight @entity57 , the @entity6 champion , and the @entity60 champion @entity59 are flying in to see what is the biggest fight in the division ; they all want to fight the winner			1
either fighter against @entity57 and either fighter against the winner of @entity68 against @entity70 champion @entity69 is a massive fight			0
but if you asked @entity1 and @entity0 if they 'd rather win a world title or win on saturday night , the answer would be to win this fight			1
it means much more to them than a world title			2
i believe there 's a future for both of them in the division but losing is not an option for either of them			0
i really like both guys and my job as a promoter is to provide the best fights , and that was this one			0
@entity93 weighed in just below the 200lb cruiserweight limit set for the fight @entity0 was also just inside the weight limit at 199lbs when he stepped on the scales @entity1 at an open workout in @entity99 in the week leading up to the fight but unfortunately one of them will lose and he will be my fighter			1
normally i am screaming and shouting at ringside but i wo n't be this time			1
i do n't have any favourites , it 's a case of may the best man win			2
there are so many questions surrounding this fight			0
we do n't know how hard @entity0 punches at cruiserweight			1
he 's had two good knockouts against two durable fighters but @entity1 stood up to @entity0 before			1
how mentally strong is @entity1 ? he looked massive on the scales but does he still have the speed he had at light - heavyweight			2
does he punch harder ? the only argument i do n't think you can make is a @entity0 victory on points ; that 's the only result i do n't see happening			1
i see @entity1 on points and by stoppage and i see @entity0 by stoppage			1
i think it will come down to game plans going out the window and both guys trading and one guy getting knocked out spectacularly			0
it could be either one			0
@entity0 is determined to beat @entity1 this time having pushed him all the way during their first meeting @entity134 ( right ) joins @entity135 ( left ) and @entity1 at his training session in @entity99 @entity0 and @entity1 fought in 2011 at @entity23 's @entity11 with the @entity93 winning a thrilling bout whatever happens , i want both men to shake hands but i do n't think they will which is a shame			1
but that 's one of the reasons the fight is so big , because of that vicious rivalry			0
the point of boxing is to leave it all in the ring and afterwards it is about respect			0
i will be straight in the ring to tell both fighters to congratulate each other			0
i tried to do it after @entity155 but it did n't really work out because of the way it finished			2
sometimes it runs too deep and this might be another example of that			0
@entity17 and @entity163 are heading for a rematch and it almost happened after the weigh - in when both camps came face - to - face and the fighters had to be pulled apart by security			1
there were family members and team members involved			0
they do n't like each other and it goes way back			2
you talk about @entity1 and @entity0 but this goes way deeper ; back to when they were teenagers			1
there is a lot of history there and it 's distracting because they 're both in big fights on saturday night			2
@entity17 will face @entity185 on the undercard at the @entity11 @entity163 is on course for a rematch with @entity17 and their camps clashed on friday at the weigh - in @entity163 has a tough fight against @entity193 and @entity17 takes on @entity185 but it 's the kind of distraction that could sometimes prove to be a banana skin			1
what it means , however , is that the rematch gets bigger and bigger ; it looks inevitable for next year			2
also on the undercard , @entity200 defends his world title against @entity203 who is unbeaten in 17 fights since 2007 and is here to win			1
he has brought 20 or 30 people to watch him ; boxing is big in @entity208 and they have a lot of world champions			0
i think it 's going to be tough ; he 's very durable			2
@entity200 is getting better but i expect this to be his toughest fight yet			2
@entity200 will defend his world super bantamweight title against @entity203 @entity216 also has a very tough fight against late replacement @entity218 who was already in training			1
he 's a little rottweiler and will be on @entity221			0
but our man must win to secure his unification clash with @entity225 next year			0
@entity216 will take on late replacement @entity218 in a @entity227 bantamweight title defence @entity228 against @entity229 is such a great fight			1
the @entity231 are here to win			0
it 's the same group who came over with @entity235 who beat @entity237 and they fully believe they are going to beat @entity228			0
he has his hands full			0
@entity243 heavyweight champ @entity242 meets the experienced @entity244			0
many feel that @entity247 's speed and power will be too much for @entity244 , but he has other ideas and is really up for this one			0
keep your eyes peeled also for recent signing @entity253 , lightweight champ @entity255 and @entity257 ko king @entity256			0
@entity242 ( right ) will face experienced @entity258 @entity244 in his 10th professional bout catch all six hours of this monster show live and exclusive on @entity261 - go to www.skysports.com/cleverlybellew for more info .			0
