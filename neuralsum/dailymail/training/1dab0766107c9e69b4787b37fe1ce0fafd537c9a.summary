foreign students could face being sent back to their home countries after their courses finish under plans reportedly being considered by @entity4 foreign students could face being sent back to their home countries after their courses finish under hardline plans reportedly being considered by home secretary @entity4			1
the move would mean @entity8 students would have to return home in order to apply for a work visa if they wanted to continue to live in the @entity12 after they graduated			1
mrs may wants a future @entity16 government to ' move towards zero net student migration ' by sending home those who come to @entity12 on student visas			1
a source close to the home secretary told the @entity23 : ' making sure immigrants leave @entity12 at the end of their visa is as important a part of running a fair and efficient immigration system as controlling who comes here in the first place			1
' @entity4 is pressing for the next @entity16 manifesto to contain a policy that will make sure that anybody coming here on a student visa will have to leave the country in order to apply for a new visa of any kind			1
' she wants to make the colleges and universities that sponsor foreign students responsible for ensuring their departure			1
' she wants to be able to fine colleges and universities with low departure rates and deprive the worst of them of their right to sponsor foreign students			1
' under current rules , most students switch easily to a work visa from within the @entity12 rather than have to leave the country and then come back			1
mrs may has repeatedly clashed with @entity53 business secretary @entity53 - whose department has responsibility for universities - about foreign students			1
mr @entity53 has warned about tough rhetoric on immigration putting off students from countries including @entity62 from attending @entity12 institutions and the @entity53 would be highly unlikely to support any further tightening of the rules			1
a senior @entity53 source said her plan made ' zero economic sense ' and could deprive the @entity12 of highly - skilled graduates			1
' such a blunt instrument would not get our support , ' the source said			1
brain drain : a senior @entity53 source said her plan made ' zero economic sense ' and could deprive the @entity12 of highly - skilled graduates			1
file picture ' the idea that you have people from abroad studying in this country and they become engineers or scientists of huge practical value to the economy , and rather than have them stay here you immediately turf them out makes zero economic sense			2
' mrs may 's plan emerged following a week in which her allies have been caught up in an internal party feud			2
the @entity16 hierarchy is said to have blocked attempts by allies of the home secretary to stand as mps after they refused to canvass support for the conservatives in the @entity97 and @entity98 by - election last month			1
@entity100 and @entity101 declined to take part , citing the code of conduct for special advisers , which states they would have to resign if they wanted to get involved			2
the move to block their candidacy is seen as the latest power struggle amid claims mrs may is gearing up for a leadership bid if @entity113 is ousted after the election			2
chancellor @entity115 , another potential successor to mr @entity113 , was instrumental in the move aimed at depriving mrs may of allies in the @entity118			2
struggle : chancellor @entity115 is reportedly in a power struggle with @entity4 @entity16 backbencher @entity121 said : ' the man pulling the strings is @entity115 , not @entity113			2
' @entity115 is desperate to ensure he has enough mps in place to vote him on to the shortlist of two , which is put before members to choose the next leader , should there be a contest in 2015			0
' those two are likely to be @entity133 and @entity4			0
' she added : ' if @entity100 and @entity101 become mps that is two more votes for @entity4 and two fewer for @entity115			0
' @entity4 has had a lot to put up with			0
the more popular she is among party members , the nastier it becomes in @entity140			0
' former cabinet minister @entity141 , who had his own clashes with mrs may while in @entity144 , said : ' it 's quite entertainingly newsworthy but someone should stop all their entourages falling out with each other			0
' i actually think the relations between the people themselves are very good , i actually think @entity4 is one of the strongest ministers in the government , i actually think any prime minister - and @entity113 is very sensible about this - accepts he wants some strong ministers at the top of his government			0
' the entourages seem to be having a little spat between themselves			0
' but mr @entity141 , appearing on @entity164 's @entity163 , warned against grasping for simple solutions to immigration			0
he said : ' it 's very difficult to debate immigration , which is why i do agree that the major parties have tended slightly to avoid it , because it runs away , it becomes almost hysterical quite rapidly in the public debate			0
' our problem is illegal immigration - our problem is that from dangerous , poor parts of the world we have people coming in and it 's very difficult to control them if they are coming in on lorries from @entity182 or @entity183 or @entity184 or whatever			0
' legal immigration is a feature of the modern world but everybody insists it must be controlled properly			0
' he did not agree that immigration was ' somehow the cause of our housing crisis or our health crisis ' , adding : ' there are far more complicated things there that you have got to tackle			0
' what we do have to ensure is that we do have immigration , because we have got multinational companies , because half a million of the immigrants here are running their own businesses and providing jobs , we do n't want to throw out @entity207 hedge fund managers ... ' at the moment the politics of the country , because of anger , because of reduced living standards , because of the recession , are very susceptible to people telling them ' oh do n't bother with all this complicated politics , it 's foreigners , let 's get all these foreigners to go home '			2
' that is not a sensible immigration policy			0
real immigration policy is very difficult , we have reduced immigration from outside the @entity8 by about 50,000 but we have a long way to go , not least as @entity4 has been trying to do , improving the efficiency and the effectiveness of the @entity229 and the immigration service			0
