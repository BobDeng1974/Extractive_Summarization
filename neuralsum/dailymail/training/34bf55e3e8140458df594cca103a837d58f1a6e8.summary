by @entity0 published : 03:10 est , 26 june 2012 updated : 04:55 est , 27 june 2012 @entity1 , pictured , yesterday asked the @entity2 to declare the @entity4 s back - to - work programme unlawful a graduate made to work for her jobless benefits as a shelf stacker in @entity8 yesterday claimed the scheme amounted to ‘ forced labour ’ which breached her human rights			1
@entity1 yesterday asked the @entity2 to declare the government ’s back - to - work programme unlawful after she was required to work in the budget store or risk losing her £ 53.45 - a - week jobseeker ’s allowance			1
the 23 - year - old said she had to give up a voluntary post in a museum to take the placement but was promised a job interview if she completed two weeks training at @entity8			1
however , she says , that never materialised			0
the government is fighting her claim and strongly denies that its flagship work programme , which has placed thousands of jobseekers on unpaid placements since its launch last year , is equivalent to ‘ slave labour ’			1
unemployed mechanic @entity29 , 41 , is also challenging the legality of another government work scheme that compels the jobless to take unpaid work			0
lawyers for the pair are seeking a judicial review into the @entity38 programme , saying it violates @entity40 of the @entity41 , which prohibits forced labour and slavery			1
the schemes , championed by employment minister @entity45 , aim to help 250,000 young people over the next two years through training and unpaid experience in the public , private and charity sectors			0
placement - providers include chains such as @entity52 , @entity53 ’s , @entity54 and @entity55			0
miss @entity1 , who graduated in geology from @entity57 in 2010 , was placed on the scheme after attending a retail jobs ‘ open day ’ in october last year at the suggestion of her @entity62 adviser			2
legal challenge : @entity1 , pictured , was ' forced ' to leave her voluntary work at a museum to stack shelves at @entity8 or risk losing her benefits only after attending was she told she had to undertake a period of training or risk losing her benefits			1
@entity71 , @entity72 , appearing for @entity73 , said her placement at @entity8 , near her home in @entity76 , @entity77 , involved carrying out ‘ menial ’ tasks , adding : ‘ such work did not contribute to ( miss @entity1 ’s ) search for work to any extent			1
’ miss @entity1 had undertaken the work under ‘ menace of penalty ’ in breach of her human rights , she added			0
unhappy : @entity1 is shown outside the @entity8 store in @entity77 where she claims she was forced to work the court was told @entity8 is a successful firm with a net turnover of £ 500million , and her placement did not contribute to the public interest			1
miss @entity71 told mr @entity94 the way in which the back - to - work programme was administered was ‘ blatantly unlawful ’ , and had put thousands at risk of unfairly losing their benefits			2
she also accused the government of ‘ seemingly sub-delegating to private sector providers ’ how the schemes were run , including whether those who refused unpaid work should lose benefits			2
miss @entity71 added : ‘ these claimants have an entitlement to subsistence - level benefits			0
' taking away these subsistence - level benefits for up to six months is in many ways just as fundamental as being detained as an immigrant in prison			2
’ the court heard that mr @entity29 , also from the @entity114 , had been unemployed since 2008			0
he was told last november he would be required to undertake up to six months of unpaid work cleaning furniture			1
after refusing , he had his benefits cut , and now faces the loss of his jobseeker ’s allowance for six months			0
@entity120 , @entity72 , appearing for the @entity38 , argued that both legal challenges were ‘ wrong in law ’			0
he said the purpose of the schemes was to assist the long - term jobless to better equip themselves for work , and thousands of people in different situations had benefited			0
prestigious : @entity1 , 22 , is a geology graduate from @entity57			2

@entity1 *'s* lawyers say programme breached @entity40 of the @entity41 , prohibiting slavery and forced labour
the 22 - year - old said she *spent* by five hours a day *sweeping* up and stacking and cleaning shelves at @entity8 in @entity77
another claimant , @entity141 , refused to do *30* hours ' unpaid labour a week cleaning furniture for six months
lawyer compares taking away jobseekers ' benefits to putting *asylum* seekers in detention *centres*
