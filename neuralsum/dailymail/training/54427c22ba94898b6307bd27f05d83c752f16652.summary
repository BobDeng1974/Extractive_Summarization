by @entity0 published : 18:05 est , 24 april 2013 updated : 19:48 est , 25 april 2013 @entity2 ’s political guru @entity1 is to make a shock return to @entity4 in a no 10 shake - up			1
the ‘ blue skies ’ thinker , who left for @entity8 last year because he was disillusioned by the pace of reform in @entity11 , will advise a new policy board set up by the prime minister			2
the board will be run by @entity17 ’s younger brother , @entity18 mp @entity16 , who will become a cabinet office minister and also take charge of the no 10 policy unit in the run up to the 2015 election			1
new team : policy guru @entity1 ( left ) will sit on a new board of @entity18 advisers headed by @entity16 , @entity17 's younger brother @entity2 aides hailed the move as a return to the days of @entity30 , when the policy shop was run by highly ideological @entity32			1
until now , mr @entity2 ’s policy unit has been staffed solely by civil servants , a situation which has dismayed @entity18 mps who think the government has lacked drive and focus			1
lord @entity40 , the former @entity18 donor , was among several party grandees who had been calling for mr @entity2 to set up an advisory board to consult his mps			1
mr @entity1 will continue to live in @entity44 , flying back for some meetings of the new board ‘ a few times a year ’ to help develop and push through conservative policies			1
mr @entity1 was the champion of the @entity49 concept and urged mr @entity2 to adopt more green policies the prime minister tweeted this pictured of a meeting with some of his new advisers , including @entity16 ( centre left ) insiders said the aide , notorious for his scruffy and shoeless attire and penchant for travelling by bicycle , would also conduct video conferences around once a month			1
given the @entity16 family ’s reputation for being fiercely competitive , mps saw @entity16 ’s appointment as an effort to neutralise the threat from his brother @entity17 , mr @entity2 ’s most high - profile leadership rival			1
@entity30 would be ‘ appalled ’ at @entity32 who switch to the @entity71 @entity70 , one of her closest allies has said			0
former defence secretary @entity75 warned that conservatives flirting with the eurosceptic party will simply open the door to another @entity80 government			2
he also argued that @entity18 politicians should remind the public of @entity30 ’s belief that countries should n’t spend more than they earn			1
his outspoken address to the @entity86 came after @entity70 leader @entity87 claimed that if @entity30 were entering politics today she would join his party			0
dr @entity75 said : ‘ @entity30 used to say that she was born a @entity18 , would die a @entity18 and would fight for her beliefs inside the conservative party			1
‘ i think she would be disappointed , if not appalled , to see conservatives switching to @entity70 rather than argue their case inside the conservative party			0
‘ but worse , she would be horrified to think that such switching could open the door to power			0
to her mortal enemy , the @entity80			0
’ dr @entity75 spoke out as @entity70 faced the embarrassing revelation that one of its local election candidates was a member of the far - right @entity104 and another blamed @entity105 for the @entity106			0
it also sparked speculation that the younger , less ostentatious brother could end up eclipsing his more established sibling , just as @entity111 usurped his brother to win the @entity80 leadership			0
the @entity115 mayor hailed his brother ’s appointment , saying : ‘ great there is finally a @entity16 in @entity119			2
’ in a reference to their other siblings , he added : ‘ now for @entity123 and @entity124 ! ’ @entity123 is a journalist and novelist and @entity124 an entrepreneur			0
the mayor was then photographed wielding a copy of a newspaper which had carried the headline : ‘ a @entity16 finally gets into @entity119			2
’ it had been impishly doctored to read : ‘ a @entity132 finally gets into @entity119			0
’ his full name is @entity17			2
their father @entity134 said : ‘ i ’m delighted			0
the odds on a @entity18 victory must have shortened			2
’ both @entity16 and @entity17 were educated at mr @entity2 ’s old school , @entity139 , and at @entity140 , @entity141 , where both were members of the notorious and socially exclusive @entity144 dining society			1
the creation of the new policy board is designed to show backbenchers that mr @entity2 is listening to their concerns and dispel the notion that he runs an exclusive clique in @entity119			1
but the addition of a third old @entity152 to his inner circle will do little to help his cause			0
among other appointments to the board are @entity157 , who led the @entity159 rebellion and is also an old @entity152 , and @entity160 , who was in @entity30 and @entity162 ’s cabinets			0
‘ i told them i want more ideas to help hardworking people , ’ mr @entity2 posted on @entity163 after meeting the board yesterday			1
the pm ’s spokesman batted away questions over whether appointing another @entity139 - educated figure meant he was receiving a ‘ narrow ’ range of advice			0
coming for you : one mp says that ' @entity17 ' is taking over , after the mayor 's brother was appointed a @entity4 role mr @entity2 has already sought to strengthen communications with restive @entity18 backbenchers after right - winger @entity181 was recruited as a ‘ sounding board ’ last month			1
but not all @entity18 mps were convinced by the moves			1
one senior figure said : ‘ i love @entity16 , but when will @entity186 realise it ’s leadership we want , not go - betweens			2
’ @entity80 vice-chairman @entity190 said : ‘ the country needs new policies , not a new policy team			0
‘ these appointments are all about shoring up this out - of - touch and weak prime minister			0
this looks like rearranging the deck chairs on the @entity198			0

@entity2 moves to *appease* all wings of the party to prepare for 2015
@entity16 will help create the @entity18 *manifesto* for the next election
@entity1 , who oversaw *modernisation* , joins new board of advisers
one mp says : ' @entity17 is taking over '
