@entity2 cricket writer @entity1 's view of day four of the third test between @entity4 and @entity5 at the @entity6 , which saw @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity11 star			1
two stars for @entity13 @entity11 's unbeaten 70 set up @entity4 ’s second declaration of the match			2
it also meant he had passed 50 twice in the same test for the first time since he made 96 and 106 against @entity19 at @entity20 in 2011			0
what were we all worried about ? seeing double : @entity4 captain @entity11 scored a 50 in both innings of a test for the first time since 2011 @entity26 plumbs the depths poor old @entity28 deserved better than match figures in his first test of 0 for 179			1
but the harsh fact was that he had produced the worst match analysis by a debutant in test cricket			2
the previous record was held by @entity37 seamer @entity36 , who took 0 for 164 against @entity19 at @entity38 in 2009			0
woes : @entity5 bowler @entity28 has returned the worst figures ever for a debutant in international tests not such a daring declaration the timing of @entity11 ’s second - innings declaration annoyed some on social media , though most observers felt he got it spot on			1
history , though , suggested he could have called a halt much earlier			0
@entity5 ’s highest successful fourth - innings run chase in @entity4 is a modest 174 for six at @entity54 in 1971			1
cushion : @entity11 declared to leave @entity5 needing 445 to win but they have never chased more than 174 in @entity4 @entity58 ' justice is out of @entity59 @entity60 confirmed he was more than a grinder by batting attractively for 38 from 48 balls before falling for the second time in the game to a duff umpiring decision			2
@entity66 had wrongly judged him caught behind off @entity67 for 156			0
on wednesday it was @entity70 ’s turn to err , giving @entity71 out caught at short leg off @entity73			0
double injustice : @entity4 batsman @entity60 ( right ) has been given out twice incorrectly by the umpires @entity76 the @entity77 have confirmed that the @entity79 board have appealed against the fine levelled at @entity73 by match referee @entity81 over his run - in with @entity7 in the @entity84 pavilion			1
@entity81 fined @entity73 50 per cent of his match fee - around £ 3,500 - but @entity5 hope to get this overturned on friday , when @entity7 will learn his fate			2
punishment : @entity5 's @entity73 has appealed his fine for an alleged incident with @entity7 @entity91 knows his international race is run @entity93 's colossal all - rounder @entity91 announced his retirement from all international cricket on wednesday			1
he decided enough was enough on a recent tour of @entity19			0
‘ i just knew on that tour that i was done , ’ said the 38 - year - old , who will continue to play @entity99 franchise cricket			0
he finished with 11,579 one - day international runs , 273 wickets and 131 catches			0
legend : @entity93 all - rounder @entity91 has announced his retirement from international cricket			1

@entity11 scored 50 twice in same test for first time since 2011 against @entity19
@entity28 returned the worst match figures for a debutant in test cricket
@entity11 's declaration could have come sooner than a 445 world - record chase
@entity5 's highest successful chase in @entity4 is 174 for six at @entity54 in 1971
@entity60 was wrongly given out twice at the @entity6 by umpires
@entity73 has appealed fine for @entity7 incident in first test
