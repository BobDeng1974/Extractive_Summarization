@entity1 's claims that she was mistreated by @entity3 agents and lawyers as they tried to make her testify against then - president @entity5 have been backed by a never - before - seen government report			1
@entity1 , who attained global notoriety for her affair with @entity5 while working as a @entity10 intern in 1998 , had long claimed agents tried to bully her into wearing a wire against @entity5 after news of her romance with the world 's most powerful man blew up			1
her voice cracked as she relived the encounter before a large crowd of millennials at @entity21 in @entity22 on monday morning during her first public speaking engagement in more than 12 years			2
@entity1 , now 41 , maintained that the agents and lawyers , working for @entity43 's @entity42 , mistreated her , even threatening her and her mother with criminal prosecution if she did not bend to their will			1
' it was just like you see in the movies , ' she said			0
' imagine , one minute i was waiting to meet a friend in the food court and the next i realized she had set me up , as two @entity3 agents flashed their badges at me			2
' ' immediately following , in a nearby hotel room , i was threatened with up to 27 years in jail for denying the affair in an affidavit and other alleged crimes			1
when you 're only 24 yourself , that 's a long time			0
chillingly , told that my mother , too , might face prosecution if i did n't cooperate and wear a wire			1
and , in case you did n't know , i did not wear the wire			0
' claim to fame : @entity1 , pictured left next to @entity5 during her time as a @entity10 intern , became a household name after her affair with the president was leaked to the press in 1998 rare appearance : this is one of @entity1 's few public speeches , she last spoke publicly 13 years ago not ashamed : @entity1 told a crowd of more than 1,000 she fell in love with president @entity5 as a 24 - year - old woman straight out of college now , the hitherto classified 100 - page ' report of the special counsel concerning allegations of professional misconduct by the @entity42 in connection with the @entity86 ' provides a highly detailed account of @entity1 's first encounter with @entity43 's lawyers , based on documents and interviews with those involved			1
according to the report , written in 2000 but unveiled by the @entity95 after it was declassified , a prosecutor who confronted @entity1 ' exercised poor judgment and made mistakes in his analysis , planning and execution of the approach			2
' written by two lawyers charged with investigating the affair by @entity104 , @entity43 's successor as independent counsel , concluded that the ' matter could have been handled better			2
' it also asserted that the interrogation quickly went into a tailspin as @entity1 - barred from calling her lawyer or parents - grew increasingly hysterical			1
it said that when the agents first approached her in the food hall and asked for her cooperation she told them to ' go f * * * yourself '			1
but after they persisted she finally agreed to talk to them			0
@entity120 , dean of @entity122 's law school and author of ' the @entity124 : @entity5 vs. @entity43 , ' said that the report is one of the few key documents from the @entity1 episode that had not been made public			1
sequel : for her second tweet , @entity1 shared her excitement about taking part in @entity132 's 30 under @entity21 in @entity22 he said it is ' an important piece of history ' that ' finally vindicates that [ @entity1 's ] version of events checks out			2
' ' one person people seem to forget a lot about during this crisis for our country was @entity1 , ' @entity120 told the @entity95 , ' she was just this foil in the clash between @entity5 and @entity43			1
ms @entity1 became a household name â€“ and the butt of countless late - night jokes - after her affair with president @entity5 was leaked to the press in 1998 , ultimately resulting in @entity5 's impeachment			1
after living in relative obscurity for more than a decade , @entity1 penned an explosive tell - all article for @entity155 in may about the @entity5 scandal and its destructive aftermath , describing her relationship with the married president as ' consensual			1
' ' sure , my boss took advantage of me , but i will always remain firm on this point : it was a consensual relationship			0
any ' abuse ' came in the aftermath , when i was made a scapegoat in order to protect his powerful position , ' @entity1 wrote			2
' the @entity5 administration , the special prosecutor 's minions , the political operatives on both sides of the aisle , and the media were able to brand me			2
and that brand stuck , in part because it was imbued with power			0
' she has since written several opinion pieces for the publication , including a blog post about cyber-bullying published in july , in which she talked about her reaction to ' @entity1 ' jokes on the hit @entity190 series @entity192			2
she also recently weighed in on the ongoing controversy surrounding hacked nude photos of female celebrities , writing in a personal essay that she felt outrage at the gross violation of privacy and compassion for the likes of @entity202 and @entity203			0
' i have observed that as more information has gotten into the public domain , that people grow more sympathetic with her position , which was unwinnable			0
' the report concluded : ' we find that @entity42 conduct was influenced , and indeed largely driven , by the poor judgment @entity212 ( the lead prosecutor on the scene ) exhibited in his formulation and execution of the approach to achieve @entity1 's cooperation			2
' @entity219 requires far greater respect for an individual 's choice of attorney , for attorney - client relationships , and for the role of defense attorneys in the process than that exemplified in this case			0
' it comes as @entity1 used her first foray into the public sphere in more than a decade to announce her plan to launch a ' cultural revolution ' against cyber-bullying as she described her vilification following the @entity5 scandal			1
she joined @entity238 less than two hours before taking the stage at the @entity21 conference , where she was invited to speak about the ' scourge of harassment in the digital age			0
' ' overnight i went from being a completely private figure to a publicly humiliated one			0
i was @entity247 , the first person to have their reputation completely destroyed worldwide via the @entity250 , ' ms @entity1 told a rapt crowd in a room where , according to multiple eyewitness accounts shared on @entity238 , one could hear a pin drop			1
@entity1 , best known worldwide for her sordid affair with president @entity5 , did not mince words when addressing that part of her biography			1
' sixteen years ago , fresh out of college ... i fell in love with my boss , ' @entity1 declared from the stage in @entity22 , before launching into an impassioned speech about the price she had been forced to pay for her youthful indiscretion			0
' i lost my public self , or had it stolen , ' she said of her ruthless treatment at the hands of journalists and late - night comics			0
' in a way , it was a form of identity theft			0
' in 1998 , ' public @entity1 , that @entity1 , that woman ' was born			1
i was publicly identified and someone i did not recognize			0
' looking back on her experiences , @entity1 explained to the 20 - and 30 - somethings in the audience that while there was no social media back in the 90s , there were ' gossip , news and entertainment websites ' that latched onto the @entity5 scandal , relishing each detail with gusto			1
' of course , it was all done on the excruciatingly slow dial up			0
yet around the world this story went , ' she recalled , according to @entity21			0
' a viral phenomenon that , you could argue , was the first moment of truly ' social media			0

@entity1 , 41 , has long claimed she was mistreated in wake of @entity5 affair
she relived 12 - hour ordeal in 1998 when @entity3 and lawyers interrogated her
threatened to jail her and mother unless she wore wire against @entity5
when they first met her in shopping mall she told them to ' go f * * * yourself '
but they *persuaded* her to go to hotel where they refused her a lawyer
