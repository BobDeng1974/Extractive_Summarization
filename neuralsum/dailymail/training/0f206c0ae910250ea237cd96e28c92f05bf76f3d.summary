by @entity0 published : 18:04 est , 16 september 2012 updated : 18:14 est , 16 september 2012 he might have reached the ripe old age of 133 - in canine terms - but this pooch proves it 's never too late for an old dog to learn new tricks			2
@entity7 is well into his retirement - and should be taking things easy - but the energetic mongrel is often seen bounding around the kennels in south @entity12 which he currently calls home			1
staff there say @entity7 is not yet too long in the tooth to be re-homed - and they are hopeful they can find him a new owner who will care for him in his twilight years			1
mongrel of maturity : staff at @entity23 believe @entity7 could be the oldest pooch to walk through their gates since it was founded in 1860 at 19 canine years - the human equivalent of reaching 133 years - @entity7 is by far the oldest resident of @entity30 and @entity31 in south @entity12			1
he is among a growing number of pets at the kennels who are living longer in their retirement years			2
in fact , staff at @entity38 believe @entity7 could be the oldest dog to ever walk through its gates since it was founded in 1860			1
the charity now hopes it can find an owner willing to give him a comfortable home for the remainder of his life			2
@entity7 arrived in august as his owners could no longer care for him			1
however , he has impressed staff with his energy and his love of playing with toys , going for walks and lapping up attention			0
@entity56 , operations manager at @entity38 , said : ' @entity7 's owners assured us he is 19 , and we ca n't find any record of an older dog ever arriving at @entity38			1
golden oldie : at the age of 19 - about 133 years in human terms - @entity7 is among an increasing number of pets at the home who are living longer in their retirement years ' a 15 , 16 or 17 year old dog is n't such a rare sight in our kennels , but a 19 year old is a real record - breaker for @entity38			1
@entity7 still has lots of love to give , so we 're searching for a special home for him			1
' the number of older pets at @entity38 has increased by two thirds in the last five years			0
in 2007 the charity looked after 264 dogs and cats aged 10 years or older , and based on current figures it expects to care for more than 430 this year			0
the average age for a dog or cat depends on its breed , but this year @entity38 has already cared for seven dogs and 18 cats aged 15 or older			2
mr @entity56 added : ' we believe dogs and cats are living longer than they might have done a decade ago			0
this is fantastic news for owners who ca n't imagine saying goodbye to their faithful friend , but we want to remind people they could be paying for vet and food bills until well into their pet 's old age			0
' he added : ' people are feeding their pets better diets which definitely helps			0
going back 10 years , dogs used to arrive who ate their owner 's leftover cereal for breakfast , whereas now they can enjoy tailored hypo - allergenic diets			0
' many owners are also finding it easier to get veterinary treatment , either thanks to subsidised vets or through pet insurance			0

@entity7 is the oldest dog ever at @entity23
