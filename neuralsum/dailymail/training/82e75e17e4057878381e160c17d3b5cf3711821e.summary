the failed @entity1 mission was worth the human cost because it boosted the morale of the soldiers left behind in the @entity6 prisoner of war camp , according to surviving veterans			1
@entity8 , 96 , and @entity9 , 90 , were young @entity11 officers shot down in separate missions and imprisoned in the infamous @entity14 camp during the @entity15			1
mr @entity8 kept surveillance on the camp 's @entity18 guards during construction of escape tunnels and was waiting to make his getaway in the early hours of march 25 , 1944 when the daring mission was discovered			1
survivors : @entity8 , 96 , ( left ) pictured with his @entity11 photo and prisoner of war identification tag , and @entity9 , 90 , with his @entity11 medals , prisoner of war identification tag , and photo from his time in @entity31 , say the @entity1 mission boosted the morale of prisoners of war once they were recaptured , 50 @entity36 were executed by the @entity37 , but their astonishing bid for freedom from the camp , now then in south east @entity41 but now in @entity42 , was immortalised on the silver screen in the 1963 film @entity45			1
' it was a costly operation but not necessarily unsuccessful , ' said mr @entity8 , who lives in @entity47 , speaking at a @entity49 event to mark the 70th anniversary of the mission			1
' it did do a lot for morale , particularly for those prisoners who 'd been there for a long time			2
@entity14 survivor @entity8 as a young @entity11 officer ' they felt they were able to contribute something , even if they were n't able to get out			1
' they felt they could help in some way and trust me , in prison camps , morale is very important			0
' the veterans were joined for a special screening of the 1963 film by wilderness survival expert @entity71 and comedian @entity73			1
mr @entity9 , who lives in @entity74 , said : ' i think it 's often forgotten that the @entity1 was probably one of the most audacious operations that the @entity11 carried out			1
' when you see what was achieved with limited resources ... when you think that all the equipment they had had to be made			0
the air pump was made of a kit bag and a few other bits			0
' the air pipes were made of powdered milk tins , and even the little fat lamps were made of boiled margarine			0
' the plan for the @entity1 took shape in the spring of 1943 when squadron leader @entity93 @entity11 , who had been a lawyer in his civilian life , hatched a strategy for a major breakout			0
@entity93 , who came to be known by the codename @entity99 , created an @entity100 and inspired the camp 's @entity102 prisoners in an attempt to get in excess of 200 out			1
some 600 men helped dig three tunnels , which were referred to as @entity109 , with the hope that one would succeed			0
@entity111 started in a darkened corner of one of the building 's halls , while @entity117 's entrance was hidden in a washroom drain sump and @entity119 's was under a stove			0
the plan was for the escapees to come out the other end with civilian clothes , forged papers and escape equipment			0
on the night of march 24 to 25 march 1944 , 76 men took advantage of a moonless night to attempt get away through tunnel @entity119			0

speaking at the anniversary event in central @entity74 , @entity153 air marshal @entity152 said it had been an honour to hear mr @entity8 and mr @entity9 's memories			1
he said : ' they remind us that @entity45 is much more than a just a movie ; it was a remarkable feat of courage and resourcefulness , which sadly resulted in 50 men being killed			0
' silver screen : the story was made into the 1963 film @entity45 starring @entity143 as captain @entity45 and @entity145 as squadron leader @entity168 reconstruction : actors @entity170 and @entity146 make their way through one of the tunnels in the classic film fact vs fiction : @entity179 ' dash for the border by motorcycle in the film was added at the request of @entity143 in the spring of 1943 , @entity11 squadron leader @entity93 conceived a plan for a major escape from the @entity41 @entity187 near @entity188 , now @entity188 in @entity42			1
with the escape planned for the night of march 24 , 1944 , the @entity189 built three 30ft deep tunnels , named @entity109 , so that if one was discovered by the @entity41 guards , they would not suspect that work was underway on two more			1
@entity93 intended to get more than 200 men through the tunnels , each wearing civilian clothes and possessing a complete range of forged papers and escape equipment			2
to hide the earth dug from the tunnels the prisoners attached pouches of the sand inside their trousers so that as they walked around it would scatter			2
the prisoners wore greatcoats to conceal the bulges made by the sand and were referred to as ' penguins ' because of their supposed resemblance to the animal			2
when the attempt began it was discovered that @entity119 had come up short and instead of reaching into a nearby forest , the first man in fact emerged just short of the tree line , close to a guard tower			0
plans for one man to leave every minute was reduced to 10 per hour			0
in total 76 men crawled through to initial freedom , but the 77th was spotted by a guard			0
in the hunt for the entrance one guard @entity228 crawled through the tunnel but after becoming trapped at the other end called for help			0
the prisoners opened the entrance , revealing the location			0
of the escapees 73 were captured , and 50 of them @entity239 1963 film @entity45 was based on real events , and although some characters were fictitious many were based on real people , or amalgams of several of those involved			1
the film starred @entity143 as captain @entity45 , @entity147 as flight lieutenant @entity248 and @entity145 as squadron leader @entity168 , and was based on a book of the same name by @entity251			2
contrary to the film no @entity254 pows were involved in the escape attempt , and there were no escapes by motorcycle or aircraft			2
@entity179 ' dash for the border by motorcycle was added by request of @entity143 , who did the stunt riding himself except for the final jump .			2
