by @entity0 published : 06:06 est , 22 november 2013 updated : 12:22 est , 22 november 2013 shoppers could be banned from buying hair bleach , nail varnish remover and drain cleaners under new anti-terrorism proposals			1
the @entity6 is examining ways to restrict the availability of chemicals which would - be terrorists could use to manufacture explosives			0
yesterday it published proposals to inhibit the sale of chemicals such as hydrogen peroxide , which is found in home hair dyeing kits , disinfectants and fish tank cleaner , and acetone , found in nail varnish remover and used to remove popular gel nail polish			1
new anti-terrorism proposals would limit the sale of hydrogen peroxide , pictured , which can be used to make explosives under the new proposals , the public could be banned from buying them altogether , or would be required to obtain a licence before buying them			1
another suggestion is that purchasers would have to give their name and address to the retailers at the till			0
the plans have been published as a part of a @entity39 drive to limit the availability of chemicals that can be used in terrorism			0
drawn up after a consultation , the @entity6 proposal says : ' further government intervention is necessary to deter and detect terrorist acquisition of explosive precursors , and to comply with @entity39 law			0
' it aims not just to prevent terrorist attacks , but to alert authorities to anyone planning such attacks			0
a list of chemicals whose sale would be restricted includes hydrogen peroxide , used in home bleach , fish tank cleaner , wound disinfectant , metal etching kits and swimming pool and hot tub cleaners , and nitromethane , used as fuel for model engines			1
potassium chlorate and sodium chlorate , used in weedkiller and home fireworks , are on the list , which also includes acetone , used in nail varnish remover , sulphuric acid , found in drain and swimming pool cleaner , and hexamine , found in camping fuel tablets			2
this cctv still shows @entity79 , right , and @entity80 buying hydrogen peroxide two dates before the 7/7 @entity84 terror attacks the @entity6 proposal says : ' in the @entity86 and globally , explosives have been the terrorist â€™s weapon of choice for many years			1
' @entity90 explosives have been part of over 70 % of @entity86 homeland attacks since the late 1990s			2
they are capable of causing mass harm and significant infrastructure damage			0
' some of the chemicals used to make the explosives used in the attacks also have legitimate uses in the home			2
it is important that we protect against their misuse , whilst still allowing legitimate use			0
' muslim extremists behind the 7/7 terror attacks on @entity84 in 2005 used bombs made with hydrogen peroxide from hair dye			1
the attacks left 52 people dead and more than 700 injured			0
these are among the chemicals whose sale might be restricted under new proposals from the @entity6 , and their main uses : hydrogen peroxide : fish tank cleaner , wound disinfectant , metal etching , cleaning and treatment , bleaching agent @entity124 : model engine fuel nitric acid : metal etching potassium chlorate : pyrotechnics , herbicide the proposed legislation would see restrictions on a raft of chemicals currently available on the open market potassium perchlorate : pyrotechnics and rocket propellant sodium chlorate : pyrotechnics , herbicide sodium perchlorate : @entity129 , rocket propellant @entity143 : camping fuel tablets sulphuric acid : swimming pool cleaner , drain cleaner acetone : household solvent , nail varnish remover potassium nitrate : food preservative , fertiliser sodium nitrate : food preservative , fertiliser calcium nitrate : fertiliser calcium ammonium nitrate : fertiliser			1

anti-terrorism proposals limit sale of chemicals used in home - made bombs
hydrogen peroxide is used in hair bleach and to clean pools and hot tubs
@entity172 , which is *widely* found in nail varnish remover , is also on the list
home - made explosives used in more than 70 per cent of @entity86 terror attacks
under new rules , shoppers would need a licence or to provide address
