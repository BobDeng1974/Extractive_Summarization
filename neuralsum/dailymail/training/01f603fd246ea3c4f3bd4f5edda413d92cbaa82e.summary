by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 09:46 est , 10 march 2013 updated : 02:49 est , 11 march 2013 landmark ruling : @entity3 is pictured leaving @entity5 @entity4 on wednesday after being removed from the @entity6 nearly 50 violent attackers are in line to be removed from the sex offenders ’ register , the @entity10 can reveal today			1
yesterday it emerged that a convicted paedophile had become the first to have his name taken off the list by exploiting a human rights ruling			2
@entity3 was jailed in the mid- 1990s for interfering with two young girls and put on the register for life			1
but the decision means his name is removed permanently and he no longer has to tell police if he is living near a school , travelling overseas or has access to young children			1
police had rejected the application , saying they did not consider the 71 - year - old to be safe and wanted him to remain under supervision			2
but despite hearing details of @entity3 ’s crimes , a judge last week said he could n’t see ‘ any benefit ’ in @entity3 remaining on the register			2
a @entity34 request by the @entity10 shows another 47 sex offenders have made similar requests to police forces			2
they are entitled to do so under a human rights ruling in 2011 which said it was wrong to keep offenders on the register without any prospect of appeal			1
the ruling sparked fury among children ’s groups			0
the @entity49 said it feared the rights of convicted sex offenders were being put ahead of the need to protect children			0
a spokesman told the @entity56 newspaper : ‘ adults who seriously sexually abuse children should stay on the register for life as you can never be sure they will not commit further offences			2
we can only try to control and contain their behaviour			0
‘ we will be monitoring the appeals process closely and will raise concerns if we believe the civil liberties of convicted sex offenders are being put ahead of the protection of children			2
’ @entity70 , director of the charity @entity72 , said : ‘ this must not open the floodgates			0
the register does an important job and appeals to be removed should only be successful after very careful consideration			1
the safety of children is paramount			0
’ hearing : at @entity80 ( file picture ) on wednesday , @entity3 became the first person in @entity83 to win the right to have his name removed from the register @entity88 mp @entity87 said the ruling was ‘ ludicrous ’			1
he added : ‘ the only thing a decision like this can do is put more people at risk			0
this sets a precedent for other cases			0
i do not see any case where people should be removed from this register			2
’ astonished : conservative mp for @entity102 said the ruling was ' absolutely ludicrous ' @entity3 committed a string of sex offences against the young girls over a five - year period			1
he was jailed for five years in 1993 but released on parole in 1996			1
last year @entity110 rejected his application to have his name removed , but the married felon won his appeal at @entity80 ’ @entity4 last week when district judge @entity115 overturned the ruling			1
@entity117 , representing the police , said : ‘ he exploited connections to commit very serious crimes against a girl who ultimately had her life destroyed			0
’ but judge @entity115 said : ‘ the order has now served its purpose and i can not see any benefit in it remaining			0
’ @entity127 said the ruling would ‘ give me the freedom to travel if i need to , to go on holiday with my wife ’			0
he added : ‘ it ’s a great weight off my shoulders			0
’ the register was drawn up to help officers track sex offenders after they are released from prison			1
anyone jailed for two years must stay on the register for life			1
but following the 2011 @entity144 ruling , adult offenders can appeal for removal 15 years after they leave prison			1
young offenders can appeal after eight years			0
a @entity149 spokesman said : ‘ offenders who continue to pose a risk should remain subject to notification for life			0

@entity155 , 71 , was jailed for five years in 1993 for child sex offences
he was released on parole in 1996 and went onto offender *'s* register in 1997
but on wednesday at @entity80 he got his name removed
it follows @entity144 ruling over appeals for paedophiles in feb. 2011
he can now roam wherever he likes with police no longer able to track him
