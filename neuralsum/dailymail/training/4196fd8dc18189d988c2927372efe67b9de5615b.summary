by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:49 est , 16 june 2013 updated : 01:46 est , 17 june 2013 women having caesarean sections could soon be saying goodbye to staples , stitches and unsightly scars – thanks to a medical version of a welding torch			1
an @entity11 firm has developed a stitch and staple - free method of ‘ welding ’ together surgical wounds which it claims creates neater joins			1
it says that mothers - to - be undergoing c - sections could be among the first to benefit , with treatments carried out as soon as this autumn			1
the company says that it takes just three or four minutes to seal a c - section wound and that scarring is minimal it is hoped the new way of closing wounds will also be suitable for burns victims and cosmetic surgery patients			1
@entity30 ’s device is based on plasma – a charged form of gas normally only seen in lightning bolts and in the intense light produced by welding torches			1
the plasma used in the @entity39 gadget is much cooler , ensuring it does not damage delicate tissue			2
at around @entity42 it is hot enough to make the skin tingle but not cause pain			0
however , it still produces a very powerful flame and when channelled through the tip of a pen - like device , it welds a thin film of specially - designed material – based on a naturally occurring sugar – over the wound , closing it			1
it is hoped eventually the thin film can be dispensed with and the powerful plasma alone will be enough to seal wounds			1
in three clinical trials on women undergoing c - sections , in which an eight - inch incision is made along the bikini line , the wounds healed better than the stitches and staples currently in use			1
the company says that it takes just three or four minutes to seal a c - section wound and that scarring is minimal			0
mothers - to - be undergoing c - sections could be among the first to benefit , with treatments carried out as soon as this autumn the gas is also said to encourage the growth of blood vessels , ensuring the area that was operated on receives a good supply of blood			1
it is also anti-bacterial , so should reduce the risk of wounds becoming infected			0
although many c - section wounds that are sealed by stitches or staples heal well , a recent study found that up to 44 per cent of women still had a raised , red scar six months on			2
@entity87 , a professor of obstetrics and gynaecology in @entity90 in @entity91 , described @entity39 ’s results as ‘ very encouraging ’			2
he added : ‘ as surgeons , we seek better ways to connect tissue , to minimise damage to healthy tissue and obtain better clinical and cosmetic results for patients			0
’ @entity101 , vice president of business development at @entity30 , the company behind @entity39 , said : ‘ no one has done this before			2
‘ using plasma enhances the complex wound healing process			2
‘ doctors can learn how to use this very quickly			0
there is almost no learning curve			0
’ @entity39 was invented by @entity101 ’s brother @entity110 , who was a medic in the @entity11 army before becoming a project manager at a firm that uses cold plasma to create semiconductors			1
he came up with the idea of combining his combat medical experience with cold plasma technology			0
the company has submitted documentation for approval so that @entity39 can be used by doctors and hospitals in @entity124			0
it says approval process should take a matter of months , meaning the new system could available for use on patients by the autumn			0
hospitals will have to pay around £ 2,500 for the equipment , plus around £ 10 to £ 15 for the kit needed for each caesarean operation .			0
