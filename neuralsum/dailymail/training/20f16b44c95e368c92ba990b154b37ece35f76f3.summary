but a down - on - its - luck @entity4 is reluctantly searching for tenants to rent disused facilities at its @entity7 in @entity9			1
the cash - strapped @entity11 space agency is unable to maintain much of its base at @entity14 so , rather than let it slide into ruin , has decided to let out some of its famous hangars			1
how it might look : a down - on - its - luck @entity4 is searching for tenants to rent disused facilities , including the @entity19 ( pictured ) , at its @entity7 in @entity14 , @entity9 among the facilities available to rent are a space shuttle launchpad ; two giant mobile platform launchers ; two space shuttle maintenance hangars ; a huge caterpillar crawler used to move rockets ; a 52 - storey @entity19 with four rocket assembly bays ; and a 15,000ft - concrete runway			1
the decision to allow private companies to rent out the @entity7 was not made lightly			1
@entity31 , director of the @entity7 , told the @entity32 : ' i have a lot of facilities that we , @entity4 , no longer need			2
' i do n’t have the money to maintain them , i do n’t have the money to tear them down			0
they ’re just going to sit and rot			0
' the downturn in @entity4 's fortunes comes a half century after the space centre opened in 1962 , the same year that @entity45 orbited @entity46			2
space shuttle @entity47 rolls to the launchpad atop a giant crawler from the @entity19 floor last may			1
the crawler is one of the unique facilities available to rent among the facilities available to rent are : renting out its facilities is symbolic of the changing times in space exploration			1
@entity7 once had 18,000 @entity4 employees , while it now has only 7,500			0
last year , @entity4 's shuttle program , which operated out of @entity14 , was closed due to high operating costs and for funds to be freed - up to develop new spacecraft that can travel beyond the @entity65 's 220mile - high orbit			1
@entity67 and @entity68 freighters will keep the space station stocked with food , water and supplies in the immediate future			2
in 2010 , president @entity74 pledged the @entity11 would send the first man to @entity76			0
but earlier this month , @entity4 announced it is to cut its exploration to the @entity76			0
it is part of the space agency 's plan to reduce its exploration of other planets			2
touchdown : @entity47 lands on the @entity7 runway last july			0
the 15,000ft - long runway is one of the facilities that @entity4 is seeking to let but the agency 's former science chief is calling the plan ' irrational '			1
with limited money for science and an over-budget new space telescope , @entity4 essentially had to make a choice in where it wanted to explore - the neighbouring planet or the far - off cosmos			1
@entity98 , who until september 2011 was @entity4 's associate administrator for science , said : ' to me , it 's totally irrational and unjustified			0
' we are the only country on this planet that has the demonstrated ability to land on another planet , namely @entity76			0
it is a national prestige issue			0

among the facilities available to rent at the @entity9 base are a space shuttle launchpad ; two giant mobile platform launchers ; and a 15,000ft - long runway
