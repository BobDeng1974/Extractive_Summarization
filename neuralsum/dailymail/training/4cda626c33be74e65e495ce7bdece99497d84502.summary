the global surge in @entity2 diagnosis has more to do with marketing than medicine , according to experts			1
diagnosis rates and prescriptions of stimulant drugs are soaring compared with five years ago , but experts say @entity2 is ' more of an economic and cultural plague than a medical one '			1
after examining the growth of @entity13 in the @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 , they concluded there are five trends which contribute to its growth			2
the global surge in @entity2 diagnosis and treatment with drugs has more to do with marketing than medicine , and in years to come we may regret treating children with drug , experts warn in a paper ( file pic ) they blame the rise on lobbying from drug companies , who have spurred some countries to relax the restrictions put on stimulants like @entity41 , the most well - known drug used to treat adhd			1
psychoanalytic treatment of the condition , usually with talking therapies , is slowly being eroded in favour of treating the problem with drugs , they said			1
more psychologists and psychiatrists are now adopting the @entity53 ( @entity54 ) standards , which are broader and have a lower threshold for diagnosing @entity2 , they added			2
there has also been a rise in vocal advocacy and support groups for the condition , who often work closely with pharmaceutical companies to promote treatment with drugs			1
lastly , the rise in internet use makes finding information on the condition , and diagnosing oneself , easy			2
this prompts people to ask their doctor for drug treatment , they said			1
@entity2 is a group of behavioural symptoms that include inattentiveness , hyperactivity and impulsiveness			2
use of the extremely common @entity2 medication @entity41 can cause dangerously long - lasting , unwanted erections with long - term use			2
the @entity83 said it has updated its advice on @entity41 to include a warning about priapism , a condition that can permanently damage a patient 's penis			0
the stimulant drug in @entity41 , methylphenidate , is also found in the brand names @entity93 and @entity41 -- an extended release version often prescribed to adutls -- among many others			0
the agency warned people to talk to their doctors before halting the drugs and said priapism has only occurred from use of methylphenidate in rare cases			0
it has come under much controversy in recent years , with some health professionals voicing concerns that diagnosing such a cluster of symptoms as one overarching disease means we are medicalising normal human behaviour			0
in the paper , researchers cited websites promoting adhd drugs , offering checklists with questions like ' do you fidget a lot ? ' , ' is it hard yfor you to concentrate ? ' , ' are you disorganised at work and home ? ' and ' do you start projects and then abandon them ? ' writing in the report , professor @entity128 , of @entity129 , @entity126 said : ' these checklists turn all kinds of different behaviors into medical problems			1
' ' the checklists do n't distinguish what is part of the human condition and what is a disease			0
' the researchers said in the @entity14 , diagnosis of @entity2 in school - age children grew from less than one percent in the 1990s to about five per cent today			1
in @entity15 , prescription adhd drugs rose from 10 million daily doses in 1998 to 53 million in 2008			0
growth in @entity17 and @entity16 has been slower , in part due to those countries ' more restrictive pharmaceutical drug laws			2
however , researchers said even those nations are now becoming more lax			0
in @entity18 , a rising number of @entity2 advocacy groups , many with close ties to the pharmaceutical industry , are raising awareness of the disorder			1
professor @entity128 voiced concerns about the rise of prescription treatment for @entity2 , which he believes may be socially constructed			2
' call it an economic and cultural plague , but not necessarily a medical one			1
' psychoanalytic treatment of the condition , usually with talking therapies , is slowly being eroded in favour of treating the problem with drugs such as the stimulant @entity41 , researchers said ' there is no pharmacological magic bullet			1
no drug can account for non-medical factors that may contribute to behavior			0
a fidgety student may be responding to the one - size - fits - all compulsory education system , he said , not a flaw in his brain chemistry			0
@entity2 continues a long history of medicalising behaviors , especially in the @entity126 , he added			1
one example he cited was masturbation , which was considered a disease a century ago			0
men and women diagnosed with masturbatory insanity were institutionalised or subjected to surgical treatment			0
' i think we may look back on this time in 50 years and ask , what did we do to these kids ? ' professor @entity128 concluded			0
the paper was published in the journal @entity197 .			0
