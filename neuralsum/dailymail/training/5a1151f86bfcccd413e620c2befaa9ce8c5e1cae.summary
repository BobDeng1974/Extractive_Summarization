the @entity0 in @entity1 next month is seen as the best occasion for a public debate between the four candidates for the @entity6 presidency			2
prince @entity7 , launching his campaign in @entity9 on tuesday , called for just such a tv occasion , saying he was ‘ ready to do it ’ and urging president @entity12 to commit along with the other contenders , @entity14 and @entity15			1
@entity7 said : ‘ if we are talking about transparency , i would like to see a public debate including the incumbent — so everyone across the world knows what our positions are			2
’ prince @entity24 has challenged @entity6 presidential candidates to a live debate @entity6 's @entity28 vice president insists there needs to be ' more transparency ' from the governing body however , the chances of @entity12 , who has most to lose from a live inquest , agreeing to such exposure are slim and @entity6 would not comment on the issue			1
@entity7 has been nominated by @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , the @entity40 and @entity41 , which means only his home country from his own @entity43 are supporting him			2
he said : ‘ i do n’t see this as a confederation issue			2
it ’s a worldwide vote			0
’ @entity7 blames his lack of backing in @entity43 on @entity12 ’s long reign and a ‘ culture of intimidation within @entity6 in which people who take a principled stand are being punished ’			1
@entity6 president @entity12 is unlikely to listen to offers of a live tv debate @entity6 candiates ( @entity57 ) @entity58 , @entity15 , @entity24 and @entity12 with the @entity43 leadership loyal to @entity12 ’s cause , @entity7 faces a fight even to be voted back on to the @entity6 executive			1
but the @entity63 - educated @entity7 does not intend to stay on in @entity64 if he fails to become president			0
‘ i can not see myself in @entity6 for the next four years , ’ he said			0
meanwhile , the @entity66 have nominated @entity7 but may not vote for him on may 29			0
they will wait to hear the views of @entity69 and @entity15 before deciding who is most likely to topple @entity12			1
a yellow - jacketed @entity71 leading @entity74 ’s parody of the @entity76 branding for transfer deadline day was hardly backed up by audience figures for their rival programme			1
in the last 15 minutes of transfer activity , there were an average of just 4,000 viewing @entity74 , compared to almost 700,000 watching on @entity76			1
@entity71 's bright yellow suit did n't improve @entity74 's deadline day viewing figures the women ’s @entity88 final is to be staged at @entity90 for the first time this season following the great success of the @entity38 v @entity93 international last november in drawing a crowd of 55,000			2
@entity95 , the @entity66 ’s director of women ’s football , made a presentation proposing a @entity90 final to the @entity66 board last week and it was well received			0
last year ’s final attracted a crowd of 15,000 to @entity102			0
the astonishing cull at the @entity104 continues with the heads of marketing , commercial and digital told to re-apply for other jobs because they will not be keeping their present ones			0
an @entity104 spokesman : ‘ this is an internal process and we are n’t prepared to comment further on individual roles			0
’ the women 's fa cup final is heading to @entity90 after the success of @entity118 's win last year @entity119 puzzled @entity120 , the newly appointed interim chief operating officer of the @entity66 , is well respected in the sports industry			0
but who on earth would want to buy a 300 - piece portrait puzzle of the former @entity126 finance director , available for £ 19.99 on @entity127 ? as one customer review put it : ‘ like most of you reading this , i have the @entity120 bath mat , drink coasters and cat litter tray but the jigsaw is the icing on the cake			0
’ @entity138 ’s upset at his move from @entity140 to @entity141 breaking down at the last minute was n’t just directed at manager @entity142 , who pulled the plug after @entity144 refused to share @entity146 ’s wages during a proposed loan spell at @entity148			1
@entity138 was also furious with a number of agents for trying to muscle in on his aborted transfer			2
@entity138 , pictured with @entity153 , was disappointed at not finding the @entity140 exit there is plenty of bad feeling between @entity144 and @entity140 , with @entity140 co-owner @entity158 saying of @entity144 chairman @entity159 : ‘ there are people out there you just ca n’t do business with			1
’ however , they are expected to be civil when they meet at thursday 's @entity168 summit , where @entity159 never says much			1
the most hostile exchanges have been between @entity170 and @entity171 .			0

prince @entity24 has challenged @entity12 to a live tv debate
@entity176 spoof failed to get viewers *tuning* in to @entity74
@entity138 is angry that his proposed move to @entity180 fell through
@entity182 and @entity159 will renew *hostilities* at the @entity168 summit
