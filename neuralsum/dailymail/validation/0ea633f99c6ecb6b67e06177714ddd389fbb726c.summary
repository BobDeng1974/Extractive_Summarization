with her dark sunglasses and stony expression , the image of @entity4 staring at her smartphone made her look such a boss that it launched its own @entity9 parody account			2
the photograph , which dates from a trip to @entity12 , @entity13 in september 2011 , was even adopted by the former secretary of state herself for her @entity16 profile picture			1
however , it seems that the picture which inspired hundreds of comedy memes could be no laughing matter for @entity4 as it emerges the photograph could be a figurative smoking gun			1
indeed , @entity4 herself has removed the image removed from her @entity16 account because it could show her using her controversial personal email account to conduct diplomacy in @entity13			1
for more than a year , the former secretary of state had used the monochrome image of her using a @entity31 on board a c - military plane headed to @entity12 in september 2011 , around a month after @entity35 's regime fell			2
but the picture , regularly seen by her 2.9million followers , was removed sunday - ostensibly to promote a political campaign for gender equality , timed to coincide with @entity41			1
the image was once a symbol of @entity4 's funny side as the face of the texts from @entity4 meme , which she said had given her ' many @entity49 ' - but fell out of favor this week			0
switcheroo : @entity4 swapped out a picture of her using a @entity31 on her way to @entity13 for a silhouette promoting a gender equality initiative however , the change also comes at a time when senior figures in @entity59 are intensifying scrutiny of @entity4 's communications from 2009 - 13 , which it was recently revealed were not conducted via official @entity65 accounts			1
@entity4 has handed over swathes of communications from the time , but it has been claimed that the documents have ' huge gaps '			2
the image was mentioned by the chairman of a @entity73 into the 2012 attack on @entity76 diplomats in @entity77 to suggest that vital communications from @entity4 's involvement in @entity13 were being kept from public view			1
rep. @entity81 ( r - @entity82 ) , today told @entity84 's @entity83 that he has been provided with no emails from the september 2011 trip - despite @entity4 being clearly pictures communicating while aboard the plane			1
proof ? the chairman of the @entity73 on @entity77 mentioned that he has seen no emails from @entity4 's time in @entity13 , despite pictures such as this one from 2011 , showing her using a @entity31 he said : ' there are gaps of months and months and months			1
and if you think to that iconic picture of her on a @entity101 flying to @entity13 , she has sunglasses on and she has her handheld device in her hand , we have no e-mails from that day			2
in fact , we have no e-mails from that trip			0
' so , it 's strange credibility to believe that if you 're on your way to @entity13 to discuss @entity13 policy that there 's not a single document that has been turned over to @entity59			1
' so , there are huge gaps			0
and with respect to the president , it 's not up to @entity4 to decide what is a public record and what 's not			0
' @entity81 also said the records do n't include anything from around the dates of the @entity77 attack itself , in which the @entity76 ambassador to @entity13 was killed			1
suspicions : rep. @entity81 ( r - @entity82 ) mentioned the pictured of @entity4 while contending that emails from her time in @entity13 had not been handed over as of sunday evening , @entity4 's profile still featured the @entity31 image , but as the ' header photo ' displayed at the top of the @entity16 page			1
in order to see it , users have to access her profile directly			0
the image will not appear in the timelines of her followers , nor when she is retweeted or appears in search results			0
@entity4 herself tweeted to explain the change of profile picture			0
she wrote : ' see my new profile pic to raise awareness on how far we 've come in reaching equal rights for women & girls worldwide			2
' she also included a link to @entity158 , which is sponsored by the @entity4 foundation she runs with her husband , former president @entity160			0
@entity4 used to love the photograph now shunted out of her @entity16 profile - at least enough to spend time making a meme out of it			0
after memes imagining her texting politicians and other celebrities took off , she made her own contribution			0
diplomatically , unlike many entries on the texts from @entity9 site , @entity4 's entry does not insult any political rivals , but just ribs the site 's creators			0
from madam secretary : @entity4 made this entry into the texts from @entity4 meme herself - but has now replaced the recognizable photo			0

former secretary of state swapped out phone picture for a blank silhouette
said the switch was to raise awareness of gender equality initiative
came amid huge scrutiny over use of private emails to enact foreign policy
photograph was *seized* on to complain about emails *withheld* from @entity59
rep. @entity81 said it ' strains credibility ' to think picture from 2011 does not show @entity4 dealing with @entity13 situation using private accounts
