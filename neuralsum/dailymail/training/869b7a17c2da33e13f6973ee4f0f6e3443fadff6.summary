detective @entity8 told the @entity10 court on monday that he had recovered the deleted pictures from the victim 's camera			0
@entity14 shielded her face with her hair and touched her eyes with a tissue as the prosecution showed jurors naked photographs of the pair taken around 1.45pm on june 4 , 2008			1
several hours later , at 5.30pm , a series of photographs show 30 - year - old @entity24 in the shower with the water running			2
the images appeared to have been taken by someone else			0
less than a minute later , a grisly photograph was taken which apparently depicts the back of @entity24 's head with his arm raised as blood trickles down his neck			1
it is alleged that it was mistakenly taken as @entity14 dragged her ex-lover 's body through his @entity57 home after stabbing him 27 times			1
a large dark obstruction in the foreground of the picture is a leg in sweatpants , the jury in @entity61 , @entity59 heard			0
the prosecution claims that the picture was taken as @entity14 flew into a rage after learning her ex-boyfriend wanted to date someone else			1
intimate : a police detective found these deleted images on @entity24 's camera seedy : the images from the camera were time - stamped as june 4 , 2008 detective @entity8 told the court that although pictures had been deleted from the camera , they remained on the hard drive			0
earlier in the day , the jury watched police interrogation tapes of @entity14 as she denied over and over again that she had stolen a handgun and used it to kill her ex-boyfriend			1
@entity14 repeatedly told authorities that she had never seen the gun and did not know her grandparents kept one at their home in @entity94 , @entity95 until it had been stolen			1
the .25 - caliber gun went missing a week before @entity24 was killed , during a break - in at the home @entity14 shared with her grandparents			1
police told the court today that the burglary appeared ' odd ' because only one gun was stolen out of four and piles of coins had not been taken			0
caught : an image apparently shows the back of @entity0 's head with his arm raised as blood trickles down his neck			1
a leg in the foreground obstructs most of the image prosecutors have claimed that @entity14 repeatedly stabbed @entity24 in his shower before dragging him to his bedroom and slicing his throat			1
she then allegedly took him back to the bathroom to shoot him in the head			0
two friends found his body in the shower on june 9 , 2008 , five days after he was killed			1

@entity14 wiped away tears as the @entity61 medical examiner said @entity24 ' may have ' already been dead when she shot him in the head - a key detail that could make way for the death penalty			1
if she did shoot @entity24 after he was already dead it could qualify as a ' heinous and depraved ' murder , which would more likely send her to death row in @entity59			0
