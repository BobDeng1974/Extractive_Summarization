at a towering 6ft 6in tall @entity0 could be forgiven for having his head in the clouds			1
reassuringly , @entity4 ’s giant heavyweight hope has his feet planted more firmly on the ground than those already acclaiming him as the next @entity9 or , even , the new @entity10			1
while those extravagant comparisons are being tossed in his direction with such premature carelessness , @entity0 himself is keeping his progress from olympic gold medallist to prospective world heavyweight champion in rational perspective			1
’ this @entity31 has some wisdom to go with the muscle			2
as he turns 25 this week , @entity0 knows that the journey takes a darn sight longer than the nine fights totalling 25 ring minutes which constitute the first year of his professional career			1
he is also aware that he will encounter along that road bigger , fitter , tougher and considerably more talented opponents than the portly old @entity41 he used as a punch bag at @entity44 ’s @entity43 on saturday night			2
‘ not everyone will fold like that under pressure , ’ he says of @entity20 , whom he reduced to a bloody , albeit still standing , pulp inside two rounds			1
@entity0 has spent just 25 minutes in the ring during his first nine professional fights @entity53 , next time out in november , the 39 - year - old @entity52 will muster sterner defiance is debatable			1
but strictly in the context of @entity0 ’s learning curve – ‘ i ’m just starting phase two of my development ’ – that fight should provide more useful experience			1
a truer litmus test could come from the fights which promoter @entity64 is pondering for next year			2
should the @entity65 take on and defeat the two @entity66 of @entity4 heavyweight boxing – @entity71 and @entity72 – in the first half of 2015 , the gateway to @entity69 could swing open			1
@entity64 has to weigh risk against reward , though			2
@entity0 is still a comparative novice			1
so while it is natural for the public to be excited about him , it is not yet the time to get carried away			0
former heavyweight champion @entity9 has played down @entity0 comparisons hard - hitting @entity0 has been likened with boxing legend @entity10 @entity71 is eager to collide with him as soon as possible , which is a warning of itself			1
as @entity71 says : ‘ i do n’t think they ’ll take the chance of putting him in with me just yet			1
’ and what ’s the rush ? the boxing fraternity are still trying to analyse the raw material which reinforces in the ring the affable nature of this most likeable contender			2
there are hints of @entity9 in the more aggressive of his work			0
there is also a bit of the young @entity96 in his vulnerability to a counter-punch , which is one remnant of his amateur days			0
the hope is that young @entity0 is very much in the process of becoming his own man			1
@entity44 ’s @entity9 , still the last undisputed heavyweight champion of the world , says of the comparison with himself : ‘ he ’s not the next @entity9 , he ’s the first @entity0			1
’ now that is the shrewdest compliment of them all			0
@entity107 short of options @entity107 displayed his considerable wealth on his @entity111 account again @entity107 continues to flaunt his money and to taunt @entity113 and @entity114			0
his problem is trying to find opponents for his two fights next year who are as credible as the the @entity113 and the @entity120 speed merchant , as his father acknowledges			2
@entity122 is risking the sack as his son ’s trainer by admitting those two long - awaited blockbusters should happen			0
‘ i do n’t know myself who i ’ll fight next , ’ says @entity107 as he sits in his @entity128 ’s @entity127 in @entity129 , up to his haunches in hundred dollar bills			0
perhaps his biggest fight is with himself			0
@entity134 takes tough path to redemption trainer @entity134 with @entity137 before his rematch with @entity139 in 1991 the road to redemption is never easy but the path chosen by @entity134 – from violent thug to esteemed boxing trainer via jail and born - again @entity145 – has been especially rough			0
that journey from the gangland of @entity44 ’s @entity148 to the corner of the world championship ring is traced in blood , sweat , tears and anger through the 330 pages of his autobiography			0
it is a small miracle that , given the benefit of his rediscovery of @entity163 , his testament ends in hope and inspiration			2
the narrative is raw and			0
honest , even though there remains an element of denial about the validity of the 15 and ten - year prison sentences imposed on his father and himself , respectively , for their roles in the knife - wielding , gun - toting turf wars of the 60s - ‘ we did n’t start it guv , we only took revenge			0
’ witness to the respect in which a man of terrifying street violence has subsequently come to be held as a trainer is borne by the stable of fine fighters with whom he has worked – @entity191 , @entity137 , @entity192 , @entity96 , @entity193 and now @entity194 among them – and especially by the great @entity196 providing the foreword to his life story the strength of the book lies in the @entity202 conversion of @entity134 to a more moral life and its body of evidence as to how the hardest game of all continues to offer salvation to those brave enough to climb from the gutter into the ring			0
