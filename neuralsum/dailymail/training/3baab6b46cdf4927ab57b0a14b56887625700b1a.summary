and the man who made the smear claim has so far refused to speak to the team investigating his allegations			0
@entity17 , who is leading an inquiry into the activities of @entity21 ’s now - defunct @entity20 , told mps he has not seen anything to back up the dirty tricks allegations			1
he was responding to allegations last month from @entity26			0
the former undercover officer alleges that in the aftermath of @entity0 ’s murder he was ordered to find ‘ dirt ’ for use against members of his family			1
mr @entity26 , 47 , said he was also asked to target @entity0 ’s friend @entity35 , who witnessed the 1993 murder in @entity5 , south - east @entity6 , and other campaigners furious at the failure to bring the killers to justice			0
yesterday it emerged that mr @entity26 , who suffered a mental breakdown before leaving the @entity43 in 2001 , has so far refused to speak to @entity44 police chief mr @entity17 about his @entity3 family smear allegations			1
speaking at a meeting of the @entity48 home affairs committee , mr @entity17 admitted his 20 - month inquiry – codenamed @entity50 – had uncovered references to relatives of the murdered teenager among the files of @entity21 ’s undercover units			1
but he said this was purely because officers were targeting protest groups that they feared could spark violence			0
asked if there was evidence of a smear campaign , mr @entity17 replied : ‘ no , none			0
there is limited reporting within our incident room that relates to @entity3 ’s murder , including references to @entity0 ’s parents @entity70 and @entity72			2
‘ there is no evidence whatsoever			0
we are really keen to speak to officers deployed at that time , including @entity26			0
’ @entity76 ? @entity35 , a friend of @entity0 's who witnessed his murder , was among those allegedly targeted by undercover officers who were trying to get ' dirt ' on those involved in the campaign for justice mr @entity17 said he was keen to meet @entity17 and mrs @entity84 and hoped to be able to reassure them about his work			1
he said a public inquiry , which has been called for by the family , may not be the best way to get to the truth			2

’ it is understood that mr @entity17 ’s team is examining previously archived @entity97 documents and files relating to the @entity3 case in an attempt to establish the truth about mr @entity26 ’s allegations			1
home secretary @entity103 indicated yesterday she would back a public inquiry if it was supported by lawyer @entity105 who is leading a review of allegations of police corruption in the original investigation into @entity0 ’s death .			2

former undercover officer claimed he was ordered to find ' dirt ' on the @entity3 family and those campaigning for justice for the murdered teen
but head of the inquiry set up to investigate the allegations says he has seen nothing in his probe to support them
