by @entity0 published : 19:56 est , 1 november 2012 updated : 20:02 est , 2 november 2012 a culture of cheating to meet exam targets extends beyond @entity4 to other key subjects , watchdogs have found			2
a series of testimonies from teachers reveals they have ‘ fiddled ’ exam grades , ‘ nannied ’ pupils through coursework and ‘ cheated because other schools are doing so ’			2
exams watchdog @entity13 disclosed that the claims were not ‘ limited to @entity18 ’ and called for a full - scale review of exam targets and league tables			1
figures published yesterday showed the full scale of the fiasco for the first time			0
nearly a quarter of schools and colleges – more than 600 – saw their @entity18 results nosedive at least 10 per cent on the previous year			2
almost 1,000 suffered at least a 5 per cent fall			0
@entity13 has found that the debacle was triggered by ‘ significant over-marking ’ of assignments by teachers who were under ‘ intense pressure ’ to achieve grade cs for their pupils			1
integrity : chief executive of @entity13 , @entity48 , said that ' a widespread loss of integrity ' has had a snowball effect on teachers @entity53 were also poorly designed in the first place , with 60 per cent of the marks resting on ‘ controlled assessments ’ – coursework written under exam conditions but marked by teachers			1
as teachers ’ leaders lambasted claims of cheating , anonymous reports quoted by @entity13 showed that staff felt ‘ unhealthy pressures ’ to inflate grades in ‘ woolly ’ assessments			1
one admitted that grades in controlled assignments were ‘ fiddled ’ to make up for poor marks in written exams			1
another said pupils ’ work was effectively rewritten by teachers			2
the testimonies emerged following interviews with more than 100 schools and postings on the @entity83 web forum for teachers			2
@entity48 , chief executive of @entity13 , said : ‘ those postings are n’t limited to @entity18			1
’ she added that there were ‘ special pressures ’ on @entity18 and that ‘ other gcses are in the main stronger ’			0
but she believed that evidence of teaching and marking to target specific grades – mainly @entity92 – was closely linked to the importance of a given subject in school performance tables			0
schools are mainly judged on results in @entity18 and maths , with science , languages , history and geography also carrying weight			0
‘ if we had the resource to map this out for all 70 subjects , i suspect that the patterns would directly relate to the place of qualifications in the accountability regime , subject by subject , ’ she said			0
‘ i ’m not expecting to see those patterns in drama			0
’ @entity13 denies results were ‘ fixed ’ but claims ‘ tactical ’ over- marking by some schools led to the grade boundary changes			1
a @entity83 survey found that 93 per cent of teachers had lost confidence in @entity13			1
@entity122 , of the @entity123 , said teachers were ‘ not to blame for the grading shambles surrounding the exam and they should not be made scapegoats for the system ’			0
video : teenagers are ' let down by the exam system '			0

exams watchdog @entity13 said there was evidence of widespread ' over-marking '
results from last *summer* triggered inquiry after marks fell short of expectation
@entity13 found grade thresholds were *higher* because of tactics by teachers to ensure high marks
