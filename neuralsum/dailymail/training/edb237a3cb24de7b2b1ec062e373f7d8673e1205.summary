scientists have discovered a vast reservoir of water under the @entity5 's mantle they say could be larger than all the ocean 's combined			1
@entity8 researchers say analysis of a rare mineral points to the huge store of water deep in @entity5 's mantle , 400 - 600 kilometres ( 250 - 375 miles ) beneath our feet			1
it echoes the hundred and fifty year old novel , ' @entity17 ' , in which @entity21 science - fiction forerunner @entity19 pictured a vast sea that lay deep under our planet 's surface			2
the evidence comes from a water - loving mineral called ringwoodite that came from the so - called transition zone sandwiched between the upper and lower layers of @entity5 's mantle the new theory , backed up by seismic data suggest that water is stored in the transition zone of @entity5 ’s mantle			1
it is thought to host minerals called ringwoodite and wadsleyite that can store water like a sponge			2
if water does exists in huge volumes beneath @entity5 's crust , it is bound to have a big impact on the mechanics of volcanoes and the movement of tectonic plates			1
the evidence comes from a water - loving mineral called ringwoodite that came from the so - called transition zone sandwiched between the upper and lower layers of @entity5 's mantle , they said in the journal @entity54			1
analysis shows that 1.5 % of the rock comprises molecules of water			1
the find backs once - contested theories that the transition zone , or at least significant parts of it , is water - rich , the investigators said			2
' this sample really provides extremely strong confirmation that there are local wet spots deep in the @entity5 in this area , ' said @entity68 of @entity8 's @entity69 , who led the research			1
' that particular zone in the @entity5 , the transition zone , might have as much water as all the world 's oceans put together			1
' @entity76 is named after @entity78 geologist @entity77 , who theorised that a special mineral was bound to be created in the transition zone because of the ultra-high pressures and temperatures there			0
a piece of this mineral has been a long - sought goal			2
where it is : researchers say the rongwoodite reveals the @entity5 's transition zone could be a vast reservoir of water it would resolve a long - running debate about whether the poorly - understood transition zone is bone - dry or water - rich			1
but , until now , ringwoodite has only ever been found in meteorites			2
geologists had simply been unable to delve deep enough to find any sample on @entity5			2
good fortune , though , changed all this			0
in 2008 , amateur gem - hunters digging in shallow river gravel in the @entity107 area of @entity108 , @entity109 , came across a tiny , grubby stone called a brown diamond			2
@entity68 holds the first terrestrial sample of ringwoodite ever found - which led to the discovery @entity76 is a form of the mineral peridot , believed to exist in large quantities under high pressures in the transition zone			1
@entity76 has been found in meteorites but , until now , no terrestrial sample has ever been unearthed because scientists have n’t been able to conduct fieldwork at extreme depths			0
it is named after @entity78 geologist @entity77 , who theorised that a special mineral was bound to be created in the transition zone because of the ultra-high pressures and temperatures there			0
measuring just three millimetres ( 0.12 inches ) across and commercially worthless , the stone was acquired by the scientists when they were on a quest for other minerals			0
but the accidental acquisition turned out to be a bonanza			0
in its interior , they found a microscopic trace of ringwoodite -- the very first terrestrial evidence of the ultra-rare rock			1
' it 's so small , this inclusion , it 's extremely difficult to find , never mind work on , ' @entity68 said in a press release , paying tribute to the diligent work of grad student @entity151			0
' it was a bit of a piece of luck , this discovery , as are many scientific discoveries			0
' the team theorise that the brown diamond rocketed to the surface during a volcanic eruption , hitchhiking in a stream of kimberlite , the deepest of all volcanic rocks			0
years of analysis , using spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction , were needed in specialised labs to confirm the find officially as ringwoodite			0
scientists have debated for decades about whether the transition zone has water , and if so , how much of the precious stuff there might be			0
none , though , has embraced @entity19 's fancy of a subterranean sea with a rocky coastline dotted with forests of giant mushrooms and petrified trees			0
the $ 20 diamond that led to the discovery : diamond sample @entity184 , from @entity107 , @entity109 , containing the hydrous ringwoodite inclusion			1
the rough diamond has been naturally sculptured to its unusual shape by corrosive mantle fluids during transport to the surface			0
@entity192 , a geologist at the @entity193 in @entity194 , cautioned against extrapolating the size of the subterranean water find from a single sample of ringwoodite			0
and he also said the water was likely to be locked up in specific rocks , in a molecular form called hydroxyl			0
' in some ways it is an ocean in @entity5 's interior , as visualised by @entity19 ... although not in the form of liquid water , ' @entity192 said in a commentary also published by @entity54			1
the implications of the discovery are profound , @entity68 suggested			0
schematic partial cross section of the @entity5 showing the location of ringwoodite , which make up approximately 60 % by volume of this part of the transition zone			1
the diamond containing the water - bearing ringwoodite inclusion found by originated from approximately 500 km beneath the @entity5 's surface , where a large mass of water may accumulate by the subduction and recycling of oceanic lithosphere , into the transition zone			1
if water exists in huge volumes beneath @entity5 's crust , it is bound to have a big impact on the mechanics of volcanoes and the movement of tectonic plates			1
' one of the reasons the @entity5 is such a dynamic planet is the presence of some water in its interior			2
water changes everything about the way a planet works , ' said @entity68 .			0

believed to be 400 - 600 kilometres ( 250 - 375 miles ) beneath our feet
1.5 *percent* of the rock analysed comprises molecules of water
first time researchers have ever found ringwoodite , a mineral in the @entity5 's mantle - after discovering it in a $ 20 diamond
researchers say discover could have a ' profound ' effect on our understanding on @entity5
