when the winter months set in , and the days get shorter , your mind inevitably drifts towards a touch of the sun. @entity4 probably is n’t the first place that springs to mind for a quick getaway , but contrary to what you might think , it ’s not out of bounds , so that ’s exactly where we ended up going for a 48 - hour jaunt			1
full disclosure : we were n’t interested in any culture for this quick trip – we just wanted a beach and the sun on our heads			2
artificial paradise : @entity20 was built out of nothing and everything is imported , right down to its plants tranquility : the hotel has four pools to choose from - this one was right on our doorstep rooms with a view : from @entity20 and you can see the sea as well as the breathtaking mountain range @entity20 is a real life mirage			1
when you land at @entity38 , you are in the middle of the desert , you drive for half an hour and suddenly you ’re confronted by a huge resort			1
and yes , like a mirage , some of it was too good to be true			2
the resort , built out of nothing around 20 years ago by businessman @entity47 , caters to those who fancy a bit of golf , diving and snorkelling or kite surfing			1
all of @entity20 is artificial , right down to its plants , so the whole thing feels a little like a @entity58 - fied version of @entity4 , and although very relaxed , you get the impression things are tightly under control			1
indeed , when we walked through the hotel ’s front door , we had to go through a metal detector which was slightly disconcerting			2
however , it is stunning and you do feel a long way from the cold , dark nights of @entity69			2
in our case , we stayed at the @entity71 and @entity72 , a five - star hotel , the biggest in the area with some 554 rooms			1
our room was spacious , clean and had a great view of the swimming pool			2
crystal clear : @entity80 inside for another spectacular pool in the relaxing spa area within the resort smug : i was very pleased with the snorkeling trip , although unfortunately it did nothing for my @entity90 tan on our first full day , we started off with a full body massage ( it ’s a tough life but somebody has to review it ) which got us properly into holiday mode			1
that was followed up with the undoubted highlight of the stay – our snorkeling trip			1
we met our boat captain @entity102 and our guide @entity104 before setting off out into the big blue beyond			2
as a snorkelling novice , i do n’t have anything to compare it to , although to my untrained eye , the water was crystal clear , warm and full of fish			2
@entity104 was a great guide , pointing out the vast array of sealife and making sure we did n’t fall too far behind			2
while the photograph of me after my first successful snorkel session shows me smiling , what the picture did n't show however was the amount of water swallowed while struggling to work out the breathing apparatus ... perhaps offering the ultimate in @entity20 's five - star delights , the @entity123 leads on to its own private beach and for those who would prefer to laze by the pool , there are four			1
inside the stylish @entity71 the golf course tempts energetic types to hit a few fairways in the sunshine and the watersports on offer range from kite surfing and diving to snorkelling			1
the @entity137 sits right on the beach , while my @entity140 experience came courtesy of the @entity143 restaurant			0
@entity144 offers buffet fare and @entity146 serves up @entity148 dishes			0
the sleek interior design of the hotel was minimalist , all white walls and splashes of colour , with views right out over the resort - it was a shame we did n't spend more time inside			1
another area of the hotel we did n't get time to fully explore was the spa			0
all sorts of treatments are offered , from facials to massages and the eastern - inspired haven from the sun. on our first evening , we opted for @entity167 , @entity169 ’s @entity140 restaurant			0
i appreciate that heading all the way to @entity4 and opting for @entity140 food might seem a bit ' off ' , but in my defence , i ’m allergic to nuts and felt it was the safest , and probably tastiest , option			1
the second day was a slightly more surreal affair			0
we began at the beach , only disturbed every so often by one of the two camels , @entity182 and @entity183 , that roamed up and down the sand through the day			0
i ca n’t say the guide was successful in convincing us to hop on top of them			0
the minimalist rooms are decorated in sleek white shades with amazing views over the resort fancy a ride ? sunbathing was surreal at times , with the camels @entity182 and @entity196 patrolling up and down the more traditional part of @entity20 was quiet , but the beautiful marina had multiple yachts bobbing about our afternoon was supposed to be a boat ride through the lagoon with a few @entity4 pensioners and indeed for the first 60 seconds it appeared that would be the case			1
but it was clear the captain was having an issue with the engine and as we drifted off from the harbour , it predictably died			0
we meandered through the water for five minutes , before another boat eventually came along to collect us and put our hapless captain out of his misery			0
it was a reminder that no matter how artificial and controlled the whole experience was , some things just do n’t go to plan			0
desert getaway : @entity20 is located on the @entity221 , an hour 's flight from @entity223 nonetheless , we took this as an opportunity to head out of the hotel to the downtown area for a more ‘ authentic ’ @entity4 experience			1
i ca n’t say my culinary choices over two days were exactly adventurous			0
as i say , i am allergic to nuts and pulses , and our final meal was in @entity234 , the buffet restaurant			0
although there was a wide selection of food , i did n’t feel i could trust what was being offered up			0
we finished off our night with a glass of wine in the bar , although the wine came out of a box rather than a bottle , which seemed a bit odd			0
but it was probably just as well - with an early flight the next day we called it a night instead of partying into the small hours			0
after spending exactly 48 hours in @entity4 , i was glad i had gone , even if for such a short time			1
the scenery was spectacular , the snorkelling breathtaking and the resort offers everything you would expect from the @entity123 name			2
i ’m not sure the destination offers anything extra that you would n’t get from a shorter trip to somewhere in @entity260 or @entity261			0
next time i would go for longer to make the most of the facilities and take up the day trips , such as the tour to the fascinating city of @entity268			0
@entity269 has direct flights from @entity271 to @entity38 , half an hour 's drive to @entity20			1
prices start at £ 87.99			0
@entity274 also offers flights from @entity276 to @entity38 via @entity223 the @entity277 is a five - star hotel which opened in december 1995 and has 554 rooms and suites spread out over eight clusters			1
it comes complete with four restaurants , four swimming pools , health club , two well equipped gym rooms , two tennis courts , one squash court , spa , ' @entity290 ' kitesurding centre , surfing , watersports , golf 1km away .			1

@entity20 resort in @entity4 was built out of nothing 20 years ago
