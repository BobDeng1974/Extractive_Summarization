@entity1 fans voiced their wholehearted backing for head coach @entity78 and his sacked assistant @entity79			2
loud chants of ' there 's only one @entity78 ' and ' there 's only one @entity79 ' rang out around the ground soon after the start			0

@entity11 nets the second for @entity3 against @entity1 @entity11 then produced a neat turn but shot over from eight yards and when @entity0 had @entity1 ' best chance so far , he nodded @entity39 's cross over the bar before leaving @entity1 to battle on with 10 men			1
@entity106 had been largely untested on his debut , his only first - half save keeping out @entity37 's acute angled shot , but @entity1 keeper @entity28 had to pull off a desperate stop from @entity55 at point - blank range in the 49th minute			2
rovers had struggled to make their numerical advantage count as @entity1 employed tight marking , with strikers @entity11 and @entity55 starved of clear - cut opportunities , but two goals in a seven - minute spell turned the game @entity3 ' way			1

@entity10 picked out @entity56 , whose accurate cross left the unmarked @entity11 the simple task of heading home for his 17th goal of the season			2
fans hold up never forgotten posters in memory of @entity1 fans @entity135 and @entity136 then , in the 80th minute , @entity31 allowed @entity12 time and room to drill in the third .			2
