by @entity0 published : 06:45 est , 26 march 2013 updated : 10:55 est , 26 march 2013 not everyone is a naturally gifted musician - but a new invention means you no longer need to be to play a note - perfect solo on the violin			2
technology lecturer @entity6 has created the @entity7 , which translates data from an optical sensor and keyboard into violin music			1
the optical flow sensor monitors the speed and angle of a bow when it is moved across indented grooves on the top of it - much like drawing a bow across an actual violin			1
scroll down to watch the video hitting the right notes : the @entity7 has an optical flow sensor which is ' played ' with a real violin bow while a keyboard is used to choose the notes pitch perfect : @entity7 inventor @entity6 believes that experienced keyboard players could learn how to use his system within a few minutes a keyboard connected to the sensor is used to play the notes and choose the pitch of the music			1
combined , this means the user can create music that sounds just like a violin is being played - without the need for years of practice			0
multi-talented : @entity6 is a technology lecturer at @entity40 but also a passionate keyboard and sax player mr @entity6 , who is a lecturer at @entity43 , told @entity44 : ' i at one time had an obsession with @entity48 , and realised i was never going to be able to play something like that on a real violin - i 'm a keyboard / sax player			1
' that got me thinking about why a violin is hard , and could it be easier but still expressive ? i was aware of various commercial and research devices , but nothing seemed to address the problem of electronic bowing as an instrument in its own right , rather than an effect or add - on			0
' the software can be used to create a variety of sounds including ringing - the term given to describe the sound made when a bow is removed part way through playing			0
it can also produce vibrato , which is a pulsating technique created by shaking the wrist			0
the lecturer believes a good keyboard player can learn how to use his system in just a few minutes			1
he added : ' a week of practicing , you can sound pretty good			0
i do n't think i have mastered it yet ; there is a lot of potential , even for expression that is impossible on a real stringed instrument			0
' mr @entity6 has produced five prototypes and may eventually bring the instrument to market			2
mr @entity6 has built other laterntive instruments - including the @entity88 , a penny whistle modified with a windcontroller to emulate wind instruments .			2
