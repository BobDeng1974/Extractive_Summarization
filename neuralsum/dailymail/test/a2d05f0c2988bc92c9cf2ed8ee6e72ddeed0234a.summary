the camera on your @entity1 could soon help save your life by testing to see if you have cancer in just a few minutes			1
scientists have developed a device that clips onto the smartphone and could even eventually be used at home			2
their device uses the powerful cameras available now on most smartphones in combination with tiny beads that bind to cancerous cells			1
when these are placed in a clip on module ( @entity23 ) that attaches to a @entity1 camera ( c ) the microbeads produce distinctive diffraction patterns when they clump around a diseased cell ( top right ) when added to a tissue or blood sample , these microbeads bind to any cancerous cells in the sample , changing the way light passes through it			1
using a smartphone app , these images can then be sent to a central computer for analysis and then the result returned in less than 45 minutes			1
a tissue sample taken from a biopsy or blood from a simple finger prick is mixed with microbeads labelled with specific antibodies			2
this mixture is then placed on a slide that is inserted into a module that can clip onto the camera of a smartphone			2
an led at the back of the module illuminates the sample on the slide and lens in the module magnifies the image , which is then captured using the camera on the phone			2
the scientists used an @entity63 in their tests meaning an @entity66 camera is enough			2
when clumped around a cell , the beads alter the way the light is scattered by the sample			1
they produce distinctive diffraction patterns in in the image if clumped together			0
the user can send this image to a central computer for analysis			0
the researchers claim it can asses 100,000 cells from a single image in around 45 minutes			1
the researchers say each test costs around £ 1.20 ( $ 1.80 )			1
the scientists behind the device , based at @entity86 and @entity87 , say it can even return results within two minutes			2
they have already tested their device to detect cervical cancer in tissue samples obtained during smear tests			1
however , they say the system - known as digital diffraction diagnosis or @entity97 - can be adapted to screen for other types of cancers and they have already begun a trial testing for lymphoma			1
professor @entity103 , a system 's biologist at @entity87 who led the work , said it could even be used to help diagnose infectious diseases like @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110			1
writing in the journal @entity112 , professor @entity103 and his colleagues said : ' we envisage that these advances will position @entity97 as a versatile screening tool for various cancer types ( eg cervix , breast ad lymphoma ) and infectious diseases ( eg @entity110 , @entity108 and tuberculosis ) with applications in field work , mobile clinics and home care settings			1
' the device works by using microbeads that specifically target molecules that sit on the surface of cancer cells			0
diseased cells often produce molecules that makes them stand out from healthy tissue and so can be detected by antibodies			1
the graphic above shows how the new device works with a @entity1 to analyse samples for signs of cancer the images above show how the microbeads ( small white circles in bottom images ) clump around cells ( dotted lines ) in samples that were found to be of high risk of cervical cancer ( left ) low risk ( middle ) and benign ( right ) by attaching specific antibodies to the beads , it is possible to make them bind to these molecules , meaning they will gather around a cancerous cell in a tissue or blood sample			1
the scientists developed a module that can be attached to the camera of an @entity63 device a tissue sample taken from a biopsy or blood from a simple finger prick could be mixed with these labelled microbeads and then placed on a slide			1
this is then inserted into a module that can be clipped onto the camera of a smartphone			0
an led at the back of the module illuminates the sample on the slide and an image is taken by the camera on the phone			0
the scientists used an @entity63 in their tests			0
when clumped around a cell , the beads alter the way the light passes through the sample by scattering it into distinctive diffraction patterns			2
this can be detected by a central computer that looks for these distinctive patterns			0
the researchers say each test costs around £ 1.20 ( $ 1.80 )			1
they tested the device on 25 women whose smear tests suggested they were at risk of cervical cancer			0
the graphic above shows the internal structure of the diagnosis module that can be attacked to a smartphone they also used it to detect infection with human papilloma virus , which is thought to cause the cancer			2
the images above show how the diffraction patterns created by beads and cells change when the beads clump around a cell , highlighting cancerous cells ( bottom ) compared to a healthy cell ( top ) they found that their results were between 92 % and 100 % accurate when compared to the current ' gold standard ' diagnostic test			1
professor @entity103 said that the prevalence of smartphone technology around the world could bring tests like this to remote areas			0
he said : ' by taking advantage of the increased penetration of mobile phone technology worldwide , the system should allow the prompt triaging of suspicious or high - risk cases that could help to offset delays caused by limited pathology services in those regions and reduce the need for patients to return for follow - up care , which is often challenging for them			0
dr @entity245 , a cancer specialist at @entity246 , said it could prove invaluable for places like @entity249 , where there are less than 10 pathologists in the whole country			0
he said : ' the global burden of cancer , limited access to prompt pathology services in many regions and emerging cell profiling technologies increase the need for low - cost , portable and rapid diagnostic approaches that can be delivered at the point of care			0
' parents can use their smartphone to spot the early stages of retinoblastoma , an aggressive , deadly eye cancer affecting predominantly young children			0
the cancer , which develops in the retinal cells of the eye , is fast growing and lead to sufferers needing their eye removed			0
taking a photo of a child 's eye using a flash can highlight signs of a tumour as the cells reflect the light back , making the pupil appear white			0
the @entity282 launched a campaign last year urging parents to use their smartphones to conduct the test .			0

digital diffraction diagnosis or @entity97 could be used to detect cancerous cells in blood or tissue samples and even detect infections from @entity108 and @entity110
technique uses *microscopic* beads that bind to diseased cells in samples
these clumps of beads change how light is scattered through the sample and can be detected using the camera on a smartphone like an *iphone*
results from the £ 1.20 ( $ 1.80 ) test are received under 45 minutes and scientists it could allow *people* to test for cancer in their own homes
