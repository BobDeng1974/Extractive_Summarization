today ’s revelation comes despite the quango ’s promises to clean up its act in the wake of a similar scandal seven years ago			0
yet @entity16 can disclose that the @entity4 sold motorists ’ names and addresses to a parking enforcement company just seven weeks after it admitted dozens of criminal offences			1

the @entity16 can also disclose the @entity4 has sold 4.85 million drivers ’ names and addresses to parking enforcement firms in the past six years at £ 2.50 a time – without checking if the companies ’ use for the private information was legitimate			1
this includes details of nearly one million drivers being passed to 12 firms that were subsequently suspended from accessing the register due to wrongdoing or bankruptcy			2
as well as these records , which were sold and accessed electronically , companies pursuing parking fines can make individual postal applications to the @entity4 , boosting its income from the sale of personal data to £ 20.8 million over the past five years			1
last night , @entity56 mp @entity55 said : ‘ it is unacceptable that the @entity4 is still handing out this confidential information on drivers without doing due diligence on either the companies or the individuals at the head of those firms			2
’ in 2005 , we revealed the agency had sold personal data to two convicted criminals who ran a wheel - clamping firm , prompting ministers to announce a crackdown and to the @entity4 making a string of reforms			1
the @entity16 can also disclose the @entity4 has sold 4.85million drivers names and addresses to parking enforcement firms in the past six years at £ 2.50 a time at the time , the @entity4 said it would start checking the criminal records of applicants for its data – although it refused to say that a conviction would be a bar in the future			1
our new investigation has found : currently , 23 companies have been approved to receive the data electronically from @entity4 vehicle records within 24 hours of applying			1
the agency makes no checks on the legitimacy of the applications			0
other parking companies can receive the data only by submitting postal applications , which are individually vetted by the @entity4			2
leading the way : how the @entity16 has reported the @entity4 scandal the @entity4 says firms are allowed electronic access only after a six - month probationary period , during which their applications are closely monitored			2
however the new string of cases raises fresh concerns over the misuse of the data obtained through the electronic system			0
@entity21 ’s firm @entity105 has bought 23,663 motorists ’ names and addresses from the @entity4 since 2006			1
last year , @entity109 investigated a number of claims that @entity105 was breaching the code of practice imposed by industry trade body , the @entity116 ( @entity115 )			0
these included sending parking tickets to car owners up to five months after they parked , erecting misleading signs , dismissing legitimate appeals and unnecessarily involving debt collection agencies			0
in march 2011 , @entity21 and @entity105 admitted 36 offences at @entity124 ’ @entity125 , which said the firm had been ‘ unreasonable , unfair , intransigent , and had deliberately misled motorists ’ as it imposed the substantial fine			2
@entity21 , as the company ’s director , admitted ‘ recklessly engaging in unfair commercial practice which contravenes the requirements of professional diligence ’			2
this is a criminal offence under @entity135			0

he also pleaded guilty to displaying 15 misleading signs and sending letters from a debt recovery firm without revealing it was owned by @entity105 itself			0
the @entity4 suspended @entity105 from accessing drivers ’ details electronically , as the @entity115 carried out an investigation into the firm			1
but just 44 days later , the trade body gave @entity105 a clean bill of health and the @entity4 lifted the suspension			0
this allowed @entity105 to immediately obtain the drivers ’ details of 1,120 vehicles it claimed to have caught parking illegally during its suspension			1
in the past 12 months @entity105 has bought details of 6,000 more drivers			2
the @entity4 has sold sensitive personal details of more than 7,000 drivers to a convicted criminal and his company the @entity16 visited the company ’s offices , but @entity21 was unavailable for comment			1
a @entity115 spokesman said : ‘ our compliance team carried out an inspection of the services provided by @entity105 and were satisfied that significant efforts had been made to rectify their practices			0

another parking firm , @entity211 bought the details of 85,000 drivers despite being the subject of a string of investigations			1

he said : ‘ when it was liquidated i completely took my hands off it			0
i do n’t know what happened to the data			0
’ a @entity4 spokesman said : ‘ landowners have a right to impose legitimate parking rules so we have to strike a balance – allowing fair enforcement but protecting motorists			1
‘ that is why information is only provided under strict controls to parking firms who meet the standards set by an appropriate accredited trade association and are compliant with its code of practice			0
‘ all companies which make electronic requests have to serve a six - month probationary period where their requests are closely monitored			0
’ a spokesman for the bpa said : ‘ ultimately we can expel a member , which removes an operator ’s access to the @entity4 database , but there are many who operate without access			2
‘ we have repeatedly asked the government to make it illegal for such companies to trade without any form of regulation but they have , so far , refused to do so			0

the number of personal records sold has **tripled** since 2006
sensitive data on 85,0000 drivers went missing after parking firm went bust
another company sold on details for profit
the number of names and addresses being sold by the @entity4 to parking enforcement companies has more than **tripled** since 2006 .
the agency plans to make significant profits from selling the details by upping the fee to help plug a £ 100 million gap in its *finances* .
another parking enforcement firm is alleged to have broken @entity4 rules by selling thousands of drivers ’ name and addresses at a profit to another company .
a further parking company bought the details of 85,000 drivers , but a director admits he does not know what has happened to the data after his firm went into receivership .
