by @entity0 dramatic new designs for skyscrapers ranging from a huge ' eco-tower ; in the @entity2 rainforest to a design with a movable roof based on a @entity6 home have been revealed as part of a design contest			1
the @entity12 shows off a range of unique designs , including a desert tower made from sand			1
it also includes a ' city in the sky ' for @entity20 , and a @entity21 for @entity22			1
the @entity23 , a @entity25 design to help montor forests for fires and conduct experiments high above the treeline			1
@entity12 received 525 projects from 43 countries in all continents			2
the jury , formed by leaders of the architecture and design fields selected 3 winners and 20 honorable mentions			2
one of the winners , @entity39 , consists of a water tower , a forest fire station , a weather station , and scientific research and education laboratories			1
it stands still at the @entity2 ’s frontier , preventing fires effectively by capturing rainwater in the rainy season and irrigating the land in the dry season			1
the lotus - shaped water tower is capable of capturing rainwater directly			1
the collected water is filtered and stored in spare reservoirs			2
using capillarity combined with active energy , the aerial roots with a distinct sponge - structure can absorb and store the excess water without disturbing the @entity2 ’s ecosystem			1
in the case of fire , firefighters fly to the scene and extinguish the fire with the collected water			0
in addition , the @entity23 provides special scientific research laboratories for scientists to monitor the climate change and the ecosystem stability			0
the laboratories also act as exhibition spaces for tourists to create environmental awareness			0
how it works : the @entity39 , consists of a water tower , a forest fire station , a weather station , and scientific research and education laboratories first place was awarded to @entity84 from the @entity85 for his project ' @entity87 '			1
the proposal reinterprets traditional @entity90 architecture in a contemporary mixed - use high - rise			1
@entity92 is the named used to describe a traditional @entity90 house			0
the curved edge of the roof can be adjusted to control the amount of sunlight entering the house while the core structural element is a wooden connection named @entity100			0
the @entity101 is located below the main roof system where the column meets the beam and girder and it is fastened without the need of any additional parts such as nails – this connection is one of the main aesthetic characteristics of traditional @entity90 architecture			0
an electromagnetic vertical accelerator , utilizing the technological principles developed at @entity115 s lhc and maglev train propulsion , the @entity111 provides a method for commercial aircraft to be accelerated to cruising speed using renewable electrical energy sources from ground based infrastructure @entity123 is a group of ecological structures designed as scientific research facilities and tourist attractions for the desert			1
the structures are divided into two parts			0
the first part , above ground , consists of several independent structures for a desert community while the second part is partially underground and partially above ground connecting several buildings and creating a multi-functional tube network system			0
the main portion of each building is constructed with sand , sintered through a solar - powered 3d printer			1
the second place was awarded to @entity143 and @entity144 from the @entity85 for his project “ car and @entity150 : or @entity152 ’s monster ” which proposes a city in the sky for @entity20 , @entity148			2
the recipients of the third place are @entity155 and @entity156 from @entity157 for their project ' @entity158 ' that investigates the structural use of carbon dioxide in skyscrapers			0
some of the honorable mentions include a skyscraper that filters the air of polluted cities , a sky village for @entity22 , a 3d printed tower in the desert , and a vertical transportation hub among other innovative projects			2
@entity173 the contest went to @entity87 by @entity84 ( @entity85 )			2
@entity92 is the named used to describe a traditional @entity90 house			0
a hanok is defined by its exposed wooden structural system and tiled roof			0
the curved edge of the roof can be adjusted to control the amount of sunlight entering the house while the core structural element is a wooden connection named @entity100			0
the @entity101 is located below the main roof system where the column meets the beam and girder and it is fastened without the need of any additional parts such as nails ¿ this connection is one of the main aesthetic characteristics of traditional @entity90 architecture			0
the second place was awarded to @entity143 and @entity144 from the @entity85 for his project @entity195 and @entity150 : or @entity197 s @entity196 which proposes a city in the sky for @entity20 , @entity148 .			2

contest asked designers to come up with a *detailed* plan for a *sustainable* city
@entity2 tower would keep an *eye* out for fires - and dispatch *drones* to deal with them
one tower could *launch* planes from its centre using a maglev track
