my mother , @entity0 , was a massive stickler for housework , and ran the house in which i grew up as though it were a military operation			1
our home was spotless , but she rarely got to enjoy one of her delicious sunday lunches , because she was too busy cleaning the kitchen afterwards			1
that ’s why , after growing up and having two sons of my own — @entity13 , 23 , and 19 - year - old @entity14 — i adopted a little mantra , which is that a home needs to be clean enough to be healthy and dirty enough to be happy , otherwise it gets in the way of living your life			1
in fact , i say it ’s fine to have a hygiene hierarchy , where relatives of the same sex do not require a change of bed linen every time they stay			1
as far as men under the age of 25 are concerned , it ’s a rule - free zone			2
with that in mind , i ’ve compiled a little list of my lazy - lady tips which can help keep your house looking decent — without unmasking your inner slob			1
@entity58 sheets ironing your bed linen while still on the bed can work wonders there once was a time when i happily spent my spare time ironing bed linen			1
it did n’t last long , particularly once i ’d had children and realised i could be spending the time more productively , either with them or on the sofa with a glass of wine			2
of course , there ’s no denying freshly ironed sheets look lovely — it ’s just a shame that getting them is so time - consuming , particularly if you ’re dealing with an unwieldy king - size duvet cover			2
so these days , if i want to please my guests , i simply iron the pillowcases and then give the top of the duvet cover a quick once - over with the iron when it ’s in situ on the bed			1
it ’s amazing how much it looks as though you have done the whole thing			2
incidentally , ‘ waffle pattern ’ duvet covers do n’t need ironing at all — something you might want to bear in mind if you ’re sale - shopping for new bed linen			1
@entity95 and @entity96 freshen up your cushions and pillows by throwing them in the tumble dryer for ten minutes often the illusion of cleanliness is as good as the real deal			2
i ’m a stickler for keeping my upholstery fresh , but even i have to concede that not everyone has the time to wash cushions and pillows every few weeks			2
you can , however , freshen them up by popping them in the tumble dryer for ten minutes with one or two scented fabric - softening dryer sheets , which will easily mask ingrained smells without going to the aggravation of washing and drying them			2
on the same theme , a few drops of tea - tree oil on a cotton wool ball rubbed along the edge of a radiator can do wonders in eliminating stale odours for a while — a particularly handy tip if you have guests who may wander into a teenage boy ’s toxic bedroom			0
vacuum - free stairs i rarely vacuum my stairs but use a dustpan and stiff bristle brush instead , which does just as good a job in a fraction of the time			0
believe me , by the time you ’ve gone to the faff of hauling the vacuum cleaner out of the cupboard and fitting the assorted attachments required to do the job , it ’s far less effort to get down on your knees and brush them			0
after all , it ’s what our mothers and grandmothers did , and their stairs were always spotless			0
the old - fashioned method also has the advantage of protecting your paintwork from bashes with the vacuum - cleaner , not to mention eliminating the trip hazard of having a cable snaking up and down your stairs			0
just make sure people take their outdoor shoes off before they go anywhere near the carpet to minimise dirt			0
@entity170 - up your clothes got a stain on your jumper ? rub in a bit of washing up liquid to remove grease stains on a similar theme , i often bypass the washing machine when it comes to clothes , and instead use a trick handed down by my dear old mum who , despite her endless rota of housework , did the laundry only once a week			1
if we ever had a stain on a jumper or skirt / trousers , she would give it a quick scrub with a damp cloth mixed with a dash of washing - up liquid , which is , after all , designed to cut through grease , until it had disappeared			0
i always used to do this with my boys ’ clothes when they were little , and i still do it with my own to this day			0
sock it to the floor this is an easy two - for - the - price - of - one cheat : if you have guests arriving for sunday lunch and your floor needs a quick scrub after all your food preparation , you can get it washed and dried in half the time if you wear a pair of towelling socks over your slippers while you mop			1
that way , you can walk over the wet surface without making muddy marks and dry the floor as you go			1
if you use the rubbish bin in place of a bucket to hold your detergent , you can give your bin a quick clean at the same time			0
@entity226 with tea @entity229 floors may look lovely , but they can also easily get scratched and stained , particularly if the wood is untreated , as it is in my study			0
i ’ve been known to move furniture around when guests come , to hide stubborn marks , but in recent years i have hit upon this novel way to save scrubbing and sanding			1
make a pot of strong tea , leave it to cool a little then apply it to the scratches using a damp kitchen cloth			0
of course , you may have to experiment with the strength of tea depending on the type of wood — but once you hit the mark , this cheap remedy can save hours on your hands and knees			0
steam clean the microwave want a sparkly clean microwave ? put in a bowl of hot water with lemon slices and turn it on high it ’s years since i have wasted elbow grease scrubbing my microwave			1
now , i employ a foolproof short - cut which removes even the most stubborn of stains — put a heatproof bowl half - filled with hot water and a few lemon slices inside the microwave before turning it on high for five minutes			1
baby - wipe your bathroom never underestimate the power of a pack of baby wipes , which are great for performing a quick and instant clean - up on most surfaces			0
i keep a pack in my car and run one over the dashboard and steering wheel every few weeks to keep the dirt and dust at bay — it takes less than 30 seconds to do , but makes your car look as though it ’s been valeted			0
i ’m not above swooshing one over my bathroom surfaces either when time is of the essence — combined with a quick squirt of detergent down the loo , you can mask a multitude of sins .			0

lots of hard to reach areas or stains you just ca *n't* seem to remove ?
