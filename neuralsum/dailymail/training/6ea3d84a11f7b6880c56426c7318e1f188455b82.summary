but last month the @entity37 ruled that @entity4 jail cells were safe and not overcrowded , allowing extradition proceedings to get back underway			1
@entity40 , prosecuting , today told a hearing at @entity42 : ' figures demonstrate the @entity4 authorities have been committed over time to reducing the number of inmates in prison			2

also known as @entity93 , which translates as ' our thing ' , the @entity93 emerged in @entity1 in the mid 19th century and is best described as a loose association of criminal groups sharing a common organisational structure and code of conduct			0
groups , often known as families or clans , will claim leadership of an area , usually a town or village , and operate rackets within it , using violence to punish those causing problems to their ' clients ' - who may well have been coerced into buying protection			0
most of the clans are led by a ' boss ' ( capofamiglia or rappresentante ) , who is aided by an underboss ( capo bastone or sotto capo ) and supervised by one or more advisers ( consigliere )			0
only men are allowed to join the clans , and candidates are not allowed to have any links to lawmen such as police officers or judges			0
