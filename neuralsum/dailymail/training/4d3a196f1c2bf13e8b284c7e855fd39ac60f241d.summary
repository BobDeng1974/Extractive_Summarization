by @entity0 patents typically feature groundbreaking devices or innovative uses of existing technology , but @entity6 ’s latest filing is neither			2
the retailer has been awarded a patent for taking photos on a white background - a process that has been carried out since cameras were invented			1
its filing even details the best way to set up a photography studio , where to place the ‘ elevated platform ’ - or table - and a step - by - step process			1
@entity6 has been awarded a patent that details a system of taking photos against a white background , stock image pictured			1
the files even explain how best to set up a photography studio			1
@entity6 has been criticised for patenting a generic shot used regularly by photographers @entity6 is developing a system to send items to buyers before they have even decided they want it			1
the technique could mean deliveries arrive within minutes - or could even be waiting for buyers when they decide to buy			0
a patent filed by @entity6 in january revealed the plans for its ' anticipatory package shipping '			2
according to this patent , the packages could wait at the shippers ’ hubs , on trucks or even in an apartment building until an order arrives			0
packages would be shipped without an exact address , which could be added once an order is made			0
this would allow @entity6 to ship copies of items such a popular book on the day it is published , for instance			0
the reasoning behind @entity6 's application remains a mystery			0
one source , however , suggested @entity6 might be wanting to patent how products are photographed and rotated on the site 's vast catalogue			1
although it sounds like a joke , the patent is available on the @entity62 website and was awarded in march			2
of course , the filing is more specific and although it describes a standard ‘ studio arrangement with a background comprising a white cyclorama and a front light source ’ , it does go into more detail			1
for example , it states the ‘ image capture position ’ needs to be located between ‘ the background and the front light source in the longitudinal axis ’ , and the shot should be taken with an 85mm lens			2
it goes on to say there should be ‘ at least one image capture device further configured with an iso setting of 320 and an f - stop value of 5.6			0
’ images of the arrangement show the ‘ elevated platform ’ , depicted as a table , positioned between the ‘ image capture position and the background in the longitudinal axis ’			0
the filing describes a standard studio arrangement with a white background and front light source			1
it also states the ' image capture position ' needs to be located between ' the background and the front light source in the longitudinal axis ' , pictured left			0
the patent even describes the work flow process , pictured right @entity6 additionally claims the shot should be taken with an 85mm lens and goes on to say there should be ' at least one image capture device further configured with an iso setting of about 320 and an f - stop value of about 5.6 '			1
this patent image shows the layout described in the files it goes on to describe a ' front light source being directed toward a subject on the elevated platform ’ with ‘ a first rear light source aimed at the background and positioned between the elevated platform and the background			1
' in short , @entity6 has described a camera pointing at a person sat on a table being lit from the front and rear , with additional lights above and below			0
@entity6 claimed this arrangement will result in photos that do n’t require a lot of editing in post-production			2
but as @entity130 ’s @entity129 explained : ' @entity6 almost undoubtedly did not pioneer this technique ’ but ‘ the extensive and specific conditions listed mean there is pretty much no way to either violate it or know if the patent has even been violated in the first place .			0
