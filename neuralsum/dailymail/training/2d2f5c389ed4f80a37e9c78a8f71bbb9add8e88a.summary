suddenly , the title race is back on			2
events at the @entity2 and @entity3 ’s over the weekend were separated by 20 hours and 300 miles , but what they did was bring the @entity7 protagonists closer together			1
@entity8 were as good as champions last week , unbeaten in 12 and having dropped points just twice all season			1
there was , as is the norm these days , talk of bookmakers already settling bets on @entity18 ’s men claiming may ’s crown – and this in november			2
@entity21 sees his shot stopped by @entity24 keeper @entity23 @entity21 ( centre ) celebrates @entity27 's goal with @entity28 ( left ) as @entity29 beat @entity24 3 - 0 @entity30 will miss @entity8 's game with @entity32 against on wednesday due to a one - game suspension @entity34 is closed down by several @entity36 players as lines up a shot at goal dec 3 : @entity32 ( @entity40 ) dec 6 : @entity41 ( a ) dec 13 : @entity42 ( @entity40 ) dec 22 : @entity43 ( a ) dec 26 : @entity44 ( @entity40 ) dec 28 : @entity24 ( a ) jan 1 : @entity32 ( a ) * @entity7 fixtures only dec 3 : @entity36 ( a ) dec 6 : @entity45 ( @entity40 ) dec 13 : @entity46 ( a ) dec 20 : @entity47 ( @entity40 ) dec 26 : @entity48 ( a ) dec 28 : @entity49 ( @entity40 ) jan 1 : @entity36 ( @entity40 ) * @entity7 fixtures only @entity32 ( @entity40 ) – @entity8 win 2 - 1 @entity41 ( a ) – draw 1 - 1 @entity42 ( @entity40 ) – @entity8 win 2 - 0 @entity43 ( a ) – @entity8 win 0 - 1 @entity44 ( @entity40 ) – @entity8 win 3 - 1 @entity24 ( a ) – draw 1 - 1 @entity32 ( a ) – draw 2 - 2 points on december 1 : 33pts points on january 1 : 48pts @entity36 ( a ) – city win 0 - 1 @entity45 ( @entity40 ) – city win 2 - 1 @entity46 ( a ) – city win 0 - 2 @entity47 ( @entity40 ) – city win 3 - 0 @entity48 ( a ) – city win 0 - 2 @entity49 ( @entity40 ) – city win 4 - 0 @entity36 ( @entity40 ) – city win 3 - 0 points on december 1 : 27pts points on january 1 : 48pts autumn champions , yes , but as we welcome winter there was a chilly reminder for the @entity65 that resistance resides within the chasing pack			1
@entity68 and @entity36 were the first team to record a clean sheet against the @entity71 during saturday ’s stalemate , thus providing the rest of the league with a blueprint of how to combat their offensive force			2
afterwards , @entity18 bemoaned the time afforded to opposite number @entity68 to devise a strategy to shut out his side			0
‘ while they were in bed on tuesday night we were getting back at 5am from @entity86			0
they have had all week to work on their plan , ’ he sounded			0
but as @entity18 will know all too well , december offers little reprieve			0
six matches are to be negotiated before the dawn of 2015			0
it is a mammoth month which can reshape the complexion of a title contest			0
and , on the evidence of their 3 - 0 triumph at @entity24 , champions @entity29 are in no mood to surrender their crown before the turkey has even been carved			1
indeed , come @entity102 they could well be back on top of the tree			0
six points now separate the @entity65 and @entity29 as we prepare to hurtle through the festive season			1
@entity109 and @entity18 ( right ) know the festive period could be crucial in the title race video we 're still league leaders - @entity18 @entity112 is wrestled to the ground by @entity114 during @entity8 's 0 - 0 draw with @entity36 @entity30 tangles with @entity114 in one of several clashes between the pair during saturday 's clash @entity28 ( left ) has impressed on is return to action for @entity29 in recent weeks @entity122 scores @entity29 's second goal in the 3 - 0 win over @entity24 come the end of @entity126 both @entity8 and @entity29 would have contested 21 top - flight points – january ’s table will tell us a lot about the destiny of this year ’s trophy			1
before this weekend is out @entity8 will have faced @entity32 and @entity41 , taking on the former without suspended talisman @entity30			1
he was part of the side which toiled at @entity36 , the @entity135 looking off the pace and out of sorts before picking up his fifth booking of the campaign			0
one match it may be , but perhaps a precedent has been set of how to foil @entity18 's men			0
the likes of @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 – who they face over @entity102 – will almost certainly adopt the gameplan which proved so effective on @entity147			2
@entity29 , meanwhile , will look at their fixtures with a sense of anticipation			1
four of the bottom seven – @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 – could well represent the 12 points of @entity102 for @entity109 ’s side			1
and , in @entity21 , they boast the league ’s best player			0
@entity21 is mobbed by his team - mates after he scores the winning goal in the win over @entity159 @entity8 were stifled by @entity36 - giving home to other @entity7 clubs that they can be stopped his first task on wednesday night is to succeed where @entity30 and @entity8 failed , and that is by penetrating @entity36 ’s defiant defence			1
but @entity29 , you feel , are gathering momentum			2
three wins on the spin – including their come - from - behind triumph against @entity159 – has seen them hit top gear as we speed towards the festive frenzy			2
suddenly , the title race is back on .			0

both teams will play seven games over the festive period and come the close of play on january 1 they may both be level on 48 points
@entity8 face *difficult* games away to @entity32 , @entity24 and @entity41
@entity29 take on four of the bottom seven in the same period
