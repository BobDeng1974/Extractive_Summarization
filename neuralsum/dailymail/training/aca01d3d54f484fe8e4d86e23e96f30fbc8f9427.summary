‘ in that case around twenty @entity1 holidaymakers were struck down with a severe stomach and sickness bug with diarrhoea			2
‘ they spent the majority of their stay confined to the bedrooms at the four star rated hotel			2

he said : ‘ the allegations raised are very similar this time ; birds in the restaurant , poor food hygiene , birds droppings in food , dirty equipment and under - cooked food			1
‘ they are all problems that lead to a good suspicion of food poisoning ‘ this is not an acceptable practice as the same rules apply to food and water hygiene as back home			1
‘ @entity215 companies need to take steps to ensure that international hygiene standards are complied with and that holidaymakers are not subjected to food - borne illness and disease			1
‘ the attention to cleanliness of equipment and staff is essential in preventing illness outbreak but in this case it looks like lessons have not been learned			0
’ while some holidaymakers have paid extra for earlier flights back to the @entity1 , many are still stranded at the hotel because flights by tour operators only run fortnightly this time of year			1
