a premature baby who surprised his parents when he was born 11 weeks during a holiday in @entity3 has finally arrived to his home in the @entity5			1
tiny baby @entity6 spent six weeks in the @entity7 after he was born weighing just 3lbs to @entity8 , 30 , and @entity9 , 30 who were on a four - day ' trip of a lifetime '			1
the anxious new parents had to wait for the all clear before they could fly their premature son home after the surprise delivery			2
but it was another week of careful monitoring at a @entity5 hospital before they could finally take @entity19 back to the family home			1
premature baby @entity6 is finally home in @entity23 with parents @entity8 and @entity9 - seven weeks after his surprise birth in the @entity7 mother @entity9 was ecstatic to finally be settling back in at @entity23 , in @entity26 , with their son			1
she said : ' this is the day we have been hoping and praying for since the very beginning			0
' it 's a huge relief to have @entity19 home , i ca n't believe how quickly he 's come on in just one week - we could n't be more proud			1
he now weighs over 6lbs so he 's practically doubled in size			0
' i feel mentally and physically exhausted so it will be great to sleep in our own bed and get @entity19 into a routine			2
' a few weeks ago we never dreamt we would have him home so soon , it seemed like a lifetime away			2
the ecstatic parents were delighted to bring their little boy home from @entity46 in @entity47 , @entity26 ( pictured ) where his feeds and weight have been closely monitored after arriving from the @entity50 new mother @entity9 said she loved @entity3 but admitted she would not be travelling there again if pregnant in the future after the debacle tiny baby @entity19 was just 3lbs when he was born to his @entity5 parents during their four - day trip of a lifetime in @entity3 ' the doctors in @entity3 had originally said the earliest we could leave was on march 10th which was @entity19 's due date so it really is a miracle			1
' both hospitals in the @entity5 and the @entity50 have been incredible and really supportive – we could n't have asked for better care			1
' now we can finally see him in his nursery which has been ready since before we left for @entity3			2
' the couple , who are both personal trainers , had saved for years for their dream city break to the @entity50 but never banked on having their child there			2
@entity9 said : ' @entity3 has become a very special place to us and we ca n't wait to take @entity19 in the future			1
we feel like we have an @entity50 family now , we met so many kind and helpful people whilst we were there			2
' the @entity80 , who helped us with our accommodation , went above and beyond and even threw me a baby shower – it was really emotional when we said out goodbyes			0
@entity9 said it was a huge relief to finally have her son home who has almost doubled in weight since he was born 11 weeks premature after spending the first six weeks of his life as an @entity50 citizen , @entity19 was flown back to the @entity5 via private jet and has now been allowed to come home for the first time @entity9 and @entity8 had been sightseeing at @entity97 when @entity9 unexpectedly went into labour - almost three months early ' i definitely want more children in the future but as much as i love @entity3 , i 've learnt my lesson and wo n't be travelling there again whilst i 'm pregnant			1
' @entity9 and @entity8 had been sightseeing at @entity97 when @entity9 unexpectedly went into labour - almost three months early			1
not only did they have the early arrival of their son to contend with , but the hospital initially refused to accept their medical insurance , leaving them with a staggering $ 130,000 medical bill			0
@entity9 said : ' we were beside ourselves with worry , but we had to focus on @entity19			1
when he was born he was so tiny and weighed just 3lbs , he needed all of our attention			0
' luckily around a week later our insurers , @entity118 , re-opened after the holidays and confirmed we were covered			0
' @entity19 was a fighter from the beginning though and did n't need any lifesaving operations			0
' he had a bit of reflux which is normal and @entity126 ( pda ) , but they are quite common in premature babies so nothing too serious thankfully			0
when @entity19 arrived early his parents had further concern after the hospital initially refused to accept their medical insurance , leaving them with a staggering $ 130,000 medical bill despite being born almost three months before he was due , ' fighter ' @entity19 did n't need any lifesaving operations and has already doubled in weight since the birth ' the next problem was getting @entity19 a passport , we just wanted to get him home so we went for an @entity50 one as this was considerably faster			1
' when we had it in our own hands it was a huge milestone then we just needed the okay for him to fly			0
' fortunately for the family they were able to fly home over a month early thanks to having their own private jet			1
they were given the all clear by @entity153 in @entity3 on the thursday evening and arrived back in the @entity5 two days later			1
at @entity46 in @entity47 , @entity26 , his feeds and weight were monitored for a week before he was finally allowed home			1
@entity9 said : ' we only had a short window to get @entity19 home as @entity46 had a bed for him but this could change at any minute			1
from the minute we were told we could leave everything was a blur			0
' we had to pack and gather all of our things before being transferred directly to our plane by an ambulance			0
we landed and took off in total eight times as we had to stop off three times to refuel before we made it back to @entity172 airport			0
after the family were given the all clear by @entity153 in @entity3 and secured the youngster a passport , he was flown back to the @entity5 on the couple 's private medical jet and has now been released from a @entity5 hospital to see his home for the first time the couple are now looking forward to showingoff @entity184 son to their family and friends who are yet to meet him ' it was n't a private plane like you 'd imagine , it was very cramped but it had all the things @entity19 needed for his big journey home			1
' the couple are now looking forward to showing off their son to their family and friends who are yet to meet him			0
@entity8 said : ' it 's great having the little man home , we can finally get him into a bit of a routine			2
we 're now organising a big welcome home party for him to thank everyone			0
' it 's so nice being able to pick clothes from our whole wardrobe again and have all of our home comforts			0
the thing me and @entity9 have been looking forward to most is being able to sleep in our bed with @entity19 by our side			2
' he seems to be settling in really well so i 've now gone back to work as someone needs to pay the bills			0
' we could n't be happier , @entity19 is coming on in leaps and bounds and has surpassed all of the doctor 's expectations			0
our next mission is for @entity19 to get big enough so we can take him back to meet his new adopted @entity50 family			2
' we have promised to keep in touch with all of the people who helped him on his journey , and they 're all excited for him to go back			0
