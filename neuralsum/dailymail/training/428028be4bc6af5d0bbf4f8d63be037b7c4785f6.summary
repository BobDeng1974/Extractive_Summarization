@entity0 yesterday issued a thinly - veiled threat to arm @entity2 with missile defences if the @entity4 attacks @entity5			1
the @entity7 leader said @entity8 had provided elements of the s - 300 military technology to @entity5 but had frozen further shipments , suggesting they could be routed elsewhere			1
that was widely seen as a threat to revive a contract for delivery of the s - 300s to @entity2 , which @entity7 cancelled several years ago under strong @entity17 and @entity19 pressure			1
the @entity39 , which targets aircraft , cruise and ballistic missiles , would make military attempts to stop @entity2 building a nuclear bomb all but impossible without a ground invasion			0
@entity5 ’s deputy foreign minister , @entity46 , said it would take ‘ every measure ’ if hit by a @entity17 - led military strike and would never give in , even if it led to ‘ @entity48 ’			0
but mr @entity38 told @entity50 there was a risk of a ‘ @entity53 ’ for the people of @entity5 if the use of chemical weapons went unpunished			2
he suggested @entity57 and other opponents of military action were ‘ letting down ’ the people of @entity5			0
confident : @entity17 president @entity60 , who earlier this week met members of @entity62 in the @entity63 of the @entity64 , said he thought a resolution paving the way for military intervention in @entity5 would be passed mr @entity0 suggested he might back intervention in the @entity69 if it was proved ‘ beyond doubt ’ that president @entity30 ordered a gas attack that killed 1,500 people , including hundreds of children , last month			1
but diplomatic sources said that despite ‘ overwhelming ’ evidence against @entity30 , @entity7 was considering publishing a dossier seeking to blame rebel forces trying to topple the regime for the attack			2
mr @entity0 said it was ‘ too early ’ to talk about what @entity7 would do if the @entity17 attacked @entity5 without @entity69 backing , adding : ‘ we have our ideas about what we will do and how we will do it in case the situation develops toward the use of force or otherwise			1
’ the @entity7 leader called the @entity94 air defence missile system ‘ a very efficient weapon ’ and said @entity7 had a contract for its delivery to @entity5			1
@entity98 : @entity60 speaks flanked by @entity64 leader of the @entity100 , @entity99 - but many congressmen are still undecided ‘ we have supplied some of the components , but the delivery has n’t been completed , ’ he said			2
‘ we have suspended it for now			0
‘ but if we see that steps are taken that violate the existing international norms , we shall think how we should act in the future , in particular regarding supplies of such sensitive weapons to certain regions of the world			0
’ in another significant escalation of tensions in the @entity116 , @entity7 dispatched a large missile cruiser to the @entity118			0
the cruiser , @entity120 , will be joined by a destroyer from @entity7 ’s @entity123 fleet and a frigate from the @entity126 fleet , tasked with ‘ protecting national interests ’			0
mr @entity38 insisted it would be ‘ very perilous ’ for the @entity17 to follow @entity130 ’s example and step back from plans to hit @entity132 in response to chemical weapons attacks , but he again told @entity50 that @entity130 will not take part in military action following last week ’s commons vote			0
@entity138 : / ? ? ? ? ? ? ? end ok proof : @entity5 president @entity30 has challenged the @entity17 and @entity141 to prove he used chemical weapons history : @entity7 has sent legislators to the @entity17 before to try to persuade @entity62 about pending legislation			1

@entity7 president said @entity62 could not decide to attack @entity5 without @entity69 *decision*
@entity60 said world could not ' be silent ' when *faced* with ' *barbarism* '
@entity0 *questioned* whether @entity5 government troops should be held responsible
@entity7 leader *implied* the chemical attack came from among the rebels
*disappointed* @entity60 cancelled meeting with him ahead of @entity35 summit
