the @entity2 security services may be guilty of killing recently pardoned code - breaker @entity3 for being gay , a human rights campaigner has claimed			1
@entity6 has written to the prime minister insisting that the government launch an investigation into the famous mathematician ’s 1954 death by cyanide poisoning			1
@entity3 , who was pivotal in cracking the @entity14 enigma codes during @entity15 which gave the @entity16 vital information about the @entity19 ’s movements , was convicted of homosexual activity which was illegal at the time			1
maybe murder ? human rights campaigner @entity6 ( left ) says the @entity2 security services may have murdered recently pardoned code - breaker @entity3 ( right ) for being gay it was thought that @entity3 died after eating a cyanide - laced apple but mr @entity6 says that the alleged apple was never tested and that the original inquest was ‘ perfunctory and inadequate ’			1
he said : ‘ @entity3 was regarded as a high security risk because of his homosexuality and his expert knowledge of code - breaking , advanced mathematics and computer science			1
‘ at the time of his death , @entity2 was gripped by a @entity38 - style anti-homosexual witch hunt			2
gay people were being hounded out of the @entity40 and the civil and foreign services			0
‘ in this frenzied homophobic atmosphere , all gay men were regarded as security risks - open to blackmail at a time when homosexuality was illegal and punishable by life imprisonment			2
doubts were routinely cast on their loyalty and patriotism			0
@entity3 would have fallen under suspicion			2
’ ' a new inquiry is long overdue , even if only to dispel any doubts about the true cause of his death - including speculation that he was murdered by the security services ( or others )			2
' i think murder by state agents is unlikely			0
there is no known evidence pointing to any such act			0
however , it is a major failing that this possibility has never been considered or investigated			0
even if the security services did not kill him , did they pressure him and did this pressure contribute to his suicide ? ' mr @entity6 ’s comments come as @entity3 was posthumously pardoned by the @entity73 under the @entity74			1
the pardon is only the fourth since the @entity15 historians credit the work of @entity3 and his fellow code - breakers at @entity80 in @entity81 with shortening the war by up to two years , saving countless lives			1
@entity3 is also widely seen as the father of computer science and artificial intelligence			2
but in 1952 he was convicted for homosexual activity , which was illegal at the time			0
to avoid prison , @entity3 agreed to ‘ chemical castration ’ – hormonal treatment designed to reduce libido			2
convicted of homosexuality : @entity3 ( centre front in his youth with friends ) , who was pivotal in cracking the @entity14 enigma codes during @entity15 , was convicted of homosexuality in 1952 which at the time was illegal wrong : mr @entity6 said that singling out @entity3 ( right ) , who invented a machine which broke the @entity19 's codes revealing their position ( left ) , to be posthumously pardoned by the @entity73 was wrong because at least 50,000 other men were convicted under the same law as well as physical and emotional damage , his conviction had led to the removal of his security clearance and meant he was no longer able to work for @entity109 , the successor to the @entity109 , based at @entity80			1
mr @entity6 said that singling out @entity3 for a royal pardon because of his fame and achievements was ‘ wrong ’			1
he said : ‘ at least 50,000 other men were convicted under the same law			1
they have never been offered a pardon and will never get one			0
selective redress is a bad way to remedy a historic injustice			0
‘ an estimated 15,000 men convicted of the same offence as @entity3 are still alive			1
‘ an apology and pardon is due to the other 50,000 - plus men who were also convicted of consenting , victimless homosexual relationships during the twentieth century			1
these men were criminalised for consenting behaviour that was not a crime between heterosexual men and women			0
’ @entity3 was granted a pardon after a long campaign to rehabilitate his reputation			1
pardons are usually given when someone has been found to be innocent after the event , but government sources said @entity3 was being pardoned because he was ‘ a truly exceptional man who saved @entity2 ’			1
in 2009 the then prime minister @entity136 issued a public apology for his treatment but did not secure a pardon			0
on christmas eve , the day @entity3 was pardoned , mr @entity140 said : ‘ @entity3 was a remarkable man who played a key role in saving this country			1
‘ his action saved countless lives			0
he also left a remarkable national legacy through his substantial scientific achievements , often being referred to as the father of modern computing			0
’ icon : the code - breaker was previously honoured with a statue in @entity154 's gay village on 8 june 1954 , @entity3 's cleaner found him dead			1
a post-mortem examination determined that he had committed suicide			0
several scholars , and even his family , have suggested @entity3 's death was not suicide - and instead either an accident or linked to a conspiracy			1
when his body was discovered , an apple laid half - eaten next to his bed			2
it was never tested for cyanide but it is speculated it was the source of the fatal does			0
some more peculiar theories suggest @entity3 was ' obsessed ' with fairytale @entity169 and his death was inspired by the poison apple in the story			1
the theory was supported in an article in @entity176 written by @entity3 's friend , the author @entity178 , in 2011			1
however , later evidence suggested that @entity3 habitually ate an apple before bed , and it was not unusual for it to be discarded half - eaten			1
his mother is said to have thought the ingestion was accidental , cause by her son 's storage of chemicals in his home			0
speaking on the 100th anniversary of @entity3 's birth on 23rd june 2012 , professor of philosophy @entity191 , @entity193 , @entity194 , @entity195 , questioned the evidence given to the inquiry in 1954			1
he said there was no evidence of premeditation - there was no suicide note and he seemed to be in a cheerful mood in the days leading up to his death			2
he added that @entity3 's career was at an all - time high and that he would not want to intentionally kill himself			1
he pointed out that his friend @entity206 stayed with @entity3 a week before his death and he remarked how happy @entity3 seemed			2
finally , the academic remarked that the inquest was so bad that @entity3 could even have been murdered			2
although it is unclear who would have wanted to murder him mr @entity191 said his work at @entity80 was under strict secrecy until well after his death			2
dear @entity140 , one big issue thrown up by @entity3 ’s pardon is : why him alone ? singling out @entity3 for a royal pardon just because he was a great scientist and very famous is wrong in principle			1
the law should be applied equally , without fear or favour , regardless of whether a person is a well - known high achiever – or not			2
selective redress is a bad way to remedy a historic injustice			0
@entity3 and the other 50,000 + men were convicted under the same ‘ gross indecency ’ law that sent @entity227 to prison in 1895			1
it remained on the statute book until 2003 , classified in the penal code under the heading ‘ unnatural offences			0
’ likewise , the law against ‘ buggery ’ , which was legislated in 1533 during the reign of @entity237 , was only repealed in 2003			0
the second point i want to raise is the case for a new inquiry into the circumstances of the death of @entity3			2
although it is said that he died from eating an apple laced with cyanide , the allegedly fatal apple was never tested for cyanide			1
moreover , he was in an upbeat mood at the time of his death and making plans for the future – not the typical profile of a person who takes their own life			0
a new inquiry is long overdue , even if only to dispel any doubts about the true cause of his death – including speculation that he was murdered by the security services ( or others )			0
i think murder by state agents is unlikely			0
there is no known evidence pointing to any such act			0
' major failing ' : mr @entity6 writes that all gay men were considered as ' security risks ' at the time of @entity3 's death however , it is a major failing that this possibility has never been considered or investigated			1
we know @entity3 was … regarded as a high security risk because of his homosexuality and his expert knowledge of code - breaking , advanced mathematics and computer science			1
at the time of his death … gay people were being hounded out of the armed forces and the civil and foreign services			0
in this frenzied homophobic atmosphere , all gay men were regarded as security risks			0
doubts were routinely cast on their loyalty and patriotism , especially following the unmasking of the bisexual and gay spies , respectively @entity294 and @entity295			0
the security services were certainly fearful that @entity3 was vulnerable to blackmail and probably anxious that he might pass information to the @entity299			0
there was an irrational , paranoid fear that other leading scientists , perhaps including @entity3 , might also aid the @entity299 ; in @entity3 ’s case may be as revenge for the way he ’d been mistreated			0
thank you for your consideration of this request			0

the code - breaker died in 1954 after eating a cyanide - laced apple
mr @entity6 is urging the government to investigate @entity3 's death
the campaigner said @entity3 's royal pardon was wrong because some 50,000 other men were convicted under the same law
