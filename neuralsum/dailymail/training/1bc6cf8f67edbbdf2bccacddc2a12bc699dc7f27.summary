@entity8 , 25 ( right ) , and a man known only as @entity10 ( pictured left with his dog @entity21 ) , were sitting on a clifftop bench overlooking @entity13 beach in @entity14 , @entity15 , when part of the 60ft cliff collapsed up to 50 tonnes of earth was displaced in the landslide , which occurred at the beauty spot this afternoon she said : ' we were just sat there chatting when @entity21 started sniffing a little crack at the top of the cliff			1
' suddenly she bolted away and both @entity10 and i got up to see what was happening and that 's when the cliff went			1
' there was a rumble and a snapping sound and it just fell away			0
' it was just a leg 's length away from us			0
' we both ran as fast as we could â€“ i even twisted my ankle running away from it			0
' but it 's as if @entity21 had a sixth sense			0
if we 'd had stayed where we had been we would have been dragged down			0
' i thank my guardian angel - and @entity21			0
' officials said about 50 tonnes of earth was displaced in the landslide , which occurred at the popular beauty spot this afternoon			1

mr @entity81 wrote : ' here 's @entity10 who were sat on a bench above today 's landslide in @entity14			1
' slightly shaken but ok ! ' it is not yet known what caused the landslide , but @entity101 believes it could have been triggered as a result of last year 's severe storms which hit the @entity105			2
she said an official who arrived to inspect the landslide today told her it that had possibly been caused by water getting into small cracks in the cliff face caused by severe weather			0
she said : ' i was told water had got into cracks and expanded when it froze in the recent cold weather			0
' the cracks have weakened the cliff until eventually it gave way today			0
' severe storms hit the @entity119 last winter , causing extensive damage across the region including the collapse of the railway line in @entity124 and the evacuation of homes across the @entity105 due to widespread flooding			2
@entity128 , manager of the @entity88 in @entity14 , said a ' huge chunk ' of the hillside had slipped away in today 's landslide			1
she said : ' there was a wall underneath some benches , i believe some people were sitting on the seats at the time , and the whole area underneath has just slid down onto the lower part of the road			2
police are urging people to stay away from the site , with debris blocking the road and access to the beach the @entity147 and @entity148 are both expected to attend the scene shortly to carry out investigations into what caused the collapse			1
it is believed to have been caused by erosion following storms ' it 's not used by vehicles particularly , unless they 've taken a wrong turning and are headed towards the beach			2
' it is used by the emergency services , but it 's the main footpath down to the beach , so a lot of tourists and local people who are walking dogs use that road regularly			1
' the @entity147 and @entity148 are both expected to attend the scene shortly to carry out investigations			0
one worker at the hotel said there were two police cars at the scene this afternoon , as well as two ' special trucks outside to keep it from sliding any further '			0
' the hotel is packed now with people coming for a cup of coffee to have a look at what 's happened , ' he added			0
' at first we thought there must be something in the ocean , so the bar supervisor rushed out and then he came running back in saying " there 's been a landslide "			2
@entity193 , bar supervisor at the hotel , added : ' it 's messy , but it could have been much worse if it had happened in the summer			0
' it 's right at the top where the benches are			0
' @entity82 and @entity83 said no one was injured in the incident and no properties were damaged as a result			2
