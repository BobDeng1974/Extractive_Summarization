by @entity0 @entity3 @entity2 captain @entity1 has withdrawn from the @entity4 due to a shoulder injury			1
the 47 - year - old missed the @entity7 at the beginning of july as a bout of bursitis affected the mobility in his left shoulder and the condition has ruled him out of next week 's major tournament at @entity15			2
the @entity16 undertook a scan during the @entity18 and a period of rest has now been prescribed			0
recovery : @entity1 says he was forced to pull out of the @entity4 as his shoulder needs time to recover @entity1 said : ' the scan showed that i really needed to rest my shoulder for a couple of months if i am to address the injury properly and so , because of that , i have regrettably had to withdraw from the @entity4			1
' it 's a pity because i would have loved to have teed up at @entity15 but i assessed the situation over the past couple of weeks during my family holiday and i think this is the sensible decision			0
' it 's not just during the week of the tournament itself that is the problem , it is the fact that the injury also hampers my normal preparation for events and you do not want to be going into any tournament - far less a major championship - not properly prepared			0
' the news will not be welcomed by @entity3 fans			0
the @entity2 is less than two months away and while there has been no suggestion that @entity1 is in danger of missing the tournament , it will undoubtedly affect his preparation and form going in to it			2
leader : @entity1 is the @entity3 captain for the @entity2 , which runs from 23 - 28 september preparation : the @entity16 said it is not just his play that is affected by his shoulder but also his preparation			1

@entity1 pulls out of @entity4
@entity16 says he needs to rest shoulder *ahead* of @entity2
