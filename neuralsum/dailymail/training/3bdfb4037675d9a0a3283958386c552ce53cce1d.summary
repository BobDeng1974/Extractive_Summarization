efforts to control mass immigration are being held back by a ‘ clearly inadequate ’ budget and the institutional bias of the @entity5 , a report warns today			1
the government dedicates just 0.25 per cent – or £ 1.8billion – of its annual expenditure to securing @entity9 ’s borders and removing illegal immigrants and foreign criminals			1
incredibly , this is six times less than the estimated £ 12billion budget for overseas aid			1
@entity16 today claimed a shortage of resources was the main reason the @entity20 failed in its attempt to cut net migration and to remove @entity24 immigrants who moved to @entity9 , file photograph in an audit released today , campaign group @entity16 said the shortage of resources was a key reason why the @entity28 have failed to hit their target to cut net migration to the ‘ tens of thousands ’			1
while the number of migrants arriving in the @entity9 has increased sharply , the number of @entity24 immigrants being removed has stayed flat at around 100,000 every year			1
in part , this is because border guards do not have the capacity to track down , for example , foreign students , many of whom stay on illegally when their course has finished			2
the report warns : ‘ it is clear the very limited resources devoted to immigration are seriously out of kilter with the very serious consequences for our society of continued mass immigration and the associated level of public concern			2
’ the think - tank also blamed the pressure put on @entity58 by liberals to continue a policy of large - scale immigration			1
it said there is ‘ a strong bias in the @entity5 in favour of immigration , combined with a reluctance even to address the case for reducing immigration ’			2
it also warns of the ‘ pro-immigration bias of parts of the @entity71 ’ and ‘ continued @entity73 enthusiasm for gdp growth , irrespective of the impact of immigration on population growth and on the lower paid ’			0
@entity16 director @entity77 , pictured , wants @entity78 to introduce specific targets to reduce migration from outside the @entity81 following the publication of today 's report the study says @entity78 was right to make an election commitment in 2010 to cut net migration to below 100,000			1
it finds significant progress has been made in reducing the number of @entity24 students coming in , largely thanks to the closure of 700 bogus colleges			0
the @entity28 have also tightened the rules for family reunion visas and made attempts to crack down on sham marriages			0
however , the government ’s efforts have been blown off course by a surge in immigration from within the @entity81 – over which ministers have no control			1
net migration – the difference between the number of people arriving here and those leaving – is currently at 260,000 a year			0
@entity16 chairman @entity77 of @entity109 urged the @entity28 to stick to the task and wants the party to introduce a specific target for reducing migration from outside the @entity81			2
the cross-bench peer said : ‘ this is the first time that a government has made a serious effort to get numbers down			0
‘ they have undeniably made valuable progress but continued strong efforts , led from the top , are essential			0
these efforts must succeed if the public are not to lose faith in our political system			0
’ a string of senior @entity5 figures , including head of radio @entity130 , who used to be director of news , have admitted the @entity133 held a ‘ deep liberal bias ’ in its coverage of immigration .			0

government spends £ 1.8 billion a year in security @entity9 borders

@entity16 claim efforts to control immigration are being *hampered*
the think tank claims the budget is ' clearly inadequate ' to cope
