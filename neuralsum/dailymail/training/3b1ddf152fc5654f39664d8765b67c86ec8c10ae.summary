a @entity1 official resigned wednesday night over a post he made on @entity3 questioning @entity5 ' contributions to the ' fabric ' of @entity7			1
the post was a critique of president @entity11 's statement that the @entity5 holiday @entity12 ' reminds us of the many achievements and contributions of @entity16 to building the very fabric of our nation and strengthening the core of our democracy			1
' ' it is one thing to be gracious on religous holidays , but this is pure nonsense , ' @entity21 , the unelected treasurer of the @entity1 of @entity22 , said in a comment accompanying @entity11 's quote			1
' exactly what part of our nation 's fabric was woven by @entity5 ? what about @entity35 , animists , and @entity37 ? should we be thanking them too ? ' he asked			1
@entity21 , treasurer of the @entity1 , is resigning his position after inciting outrage among @entity43 and @entity44 alike last week when he questioned @entity5 ' contribution to the ' fabric ' of @entity7 @entity48 remark was quickly repudiated by @entity1 activists and elected officials in @entity22 , including delegate @entity51 , who comes from a @entity5 family			1
' the fabric of this great nation is built and continues to be woven on a daily basis by every loyal patriot @entity7 , whether they are @entity58 , @entity5 , @entity59 or any religion , ' @entity51 said , according to @entity22 news website inside @entity22			1
' this is the party of @entity63			0
this is a party that represents everybody in the community regardless of their religion			0
' ' medicine , business , finance , @entity73 to name but a few contributions to the nation 's fabric			1
they should be recognized for the good works @entity5 do , ' a @entity22 resident said in a comment on @entity81 's post two days later			1
that 's not the point , @entity21 replied			2
' modern day @entity5 are integral and important members of our society , but that is not really pertinent to my previous comment			2
' @entity5 were not around in the 1700 's to " build the very fabric of our nation " as asserted by the president , ' @entity21 aruged			1
' if he had opined that @entity59 " built the very fabric of @entity93 or @entity94 " i would have been equally dismissive			0
' later that day , the @entity95 , which first brought the @entity1 official 's controversial statement to light , claimed that two party officials said @entity21 had resigned from his voluntary position with the party			1
' this is news to me , ' @entity21 said on @entity3			2
' seems like i ought to know about this if it had happened			0
' ' i have no plans to resign now or in the future , ' @entity21 told a writer for conservative @entity22 blog , @entity109			2
this is the third time in the the last two years @entity21 has publicly come under scrutiny for comments he made on @entity3			2
two weeks after president @entity11 won reelection in 2012 the @entity1 said : ' when @entity11 is 90 years old and he dies and goes to @entity114 , he is going to say " this is all @entity116 's fault " ' ' my @entity3 post was not about @entity11 going to @entity114			1
it was about his obsession with blame shifting and i do n't really see anything inappropriate about it , ' @entity21 said in an e-mail to the @entity123 at the time			0
earlier this year @entity21 accidentally called a female representative from the state a t * * t. after someone said said on @entity3 that the women should vote for @entity129 , a @entity1 delegate who is running for @entity130 in @entity22 , @entity21 wrote : ' i have nothing against @entity129 , but i hate sexist t * * t. ' soon after he deleted the comment , and posted apology			1
in yet another email to the @entity123 explaining himself , @entity21 said he meant to say ' twaddle			0
' ' also to be clear , my post was not about @entity129			0
it was relating to the sexist stereotypes being used by the woman posting , ' he said			0
@entity21 said in his resignation letter he was not sorry for what he said because it was ' historically accurate ' @entity21 , who is also a deputy chief deputy clerk of a county court in @entity22 , tried to do damage control on his recent statements on tuesday by meeting with the @entity149 of @entity22 , but the one on one did not have the intended effect			1
' on this subject matter , we all have different opinions and in his mind , [ @entity21 ] did n’t think [ what he wrote ] was offensive , and of course it was offensive to us , and not only to us but also to people throughout the state of @entity22 , ' association member @entity152 , told @entity162			2
' even elected officials thought it was offensive			0
' @entity152 told inside @entity22 that the @entity5 association wants @entity21 to resign from his $ 82,000 a year job with the @entity22 government because they are concerned he is unable to act impartially			1
' a lot of people are concerned because … they are part of jury selection , ' @entity152 said			0
' so if someone is in a position where they are in court , they are worried about whether they will truly get a jury of their peers			0
@entity21 has not quit his day job yet , but he succumbed to pressure to on wednesday night to step down from his position in @entity1 leadership			1
in a letter to members of the @entity43 's state central committee , @entity21 said that were his comment ' not causing grief for others , i would not mind			2
' but because it is causing problems for the state party , @entity21 said he would resign as soon as the committee votes on a successor			0
' it seems that no matter how careful i might be , i will periodically give occasion for others to portray the party in a bad light , so long as i am a party official , ' he wrote			0
' after discussion with several party leaders it seems clear that i will either need to stop posting on social media or step down from my party office			0
' fitzsimmonds chose the latter , saying he was not ' constitutionally suited to sit quietly on the sidelines			0
' he apologized in the letter for bringing unwanted attention to the @entity214 , but refused to retract his offending statement			0
' it is historically accurate , was a valid criticism of the president ’s revisionist history , and not a statement on @entity5 involvement in modern day @entity7 , ' he said			2
@entity223 of @entity22 chair @entity224 , one of the @entity22 leaders calling for @entity21 to resign , ' told @entity226 in an email this afternoon he was ' pleased ' to hear about the outgoing treasurer 's decision to vacate his position			1
' i look forward to putting these repeated distractions behind us and refocusing on what we should be working towards -- electing republicans , ' he said .			0

the comment was in *response* to a statement by president @entity11 on the ' contributions of @entity16 to building the very fabric of our nation '
' exactly what part of our nation 's fabric was woven by @entity5 ? ' asked @entity21 , treasurer of the @entity1 of @entity22 , on @entity3
he later explained : ' @entity5 were not around in the 1700 's to " build the very fabric of our nation " as asserted by the president '
after saying he would n't leave his voluntary position with the party , @entity21 succumbed last night to calls for his resignation
