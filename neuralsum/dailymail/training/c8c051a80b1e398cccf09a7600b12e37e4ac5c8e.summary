@entity5 , from @entity10 , said she was a self - confessed @entity11 fan and would guzzle three litres of the drink a day - as well as eating junk food - and ballooned to a size 16			1
@entity4 ( left ) and @entity5 ( right ) have both shrunk down to a healthy size ten following their matching diets @entity5 was inspired to lose a hefty three stone after seeing her favourite soap star 's success her weight soared to 12 stone 6lbs , which was overweight for her 5ft 1in frame			1
@entity5 said : ' i ’ve always thought @entity4 was gorgeous and when she lost weight i thought i could only ever dream of looking like that			1
' after seeing the @entity29 star 's weight loss success using the @entity30 , @entity5 was determined to make it work			1
' i was inspired by @entity4			2
i thought if she has managed to lose all that weight , i can too			0
' @entity5 's weight struggle began when she was working night shifts at the @entity35			2
she would scoff on convenient yet calorific sandwiches , crisps and chocolate and would even tuck into food brought in as a thank you by patients ' families			0
before her dramatic weight loss @entity5 , pictured with fiance @entity44 , weighed more than 12 stone @entity5 always admired the way @entity4 ( right ) looked and hoped she could look as good as the actress rather than face up to her unhealthy habits , @entity5 , then a size 16 , lived in denial and avoided the subject completely			1
' deep down i knew i was putting on weight but i could n’t bear the thought of it so i banned the scales and did n’t weigh myself , ' she said			0
' as my clothes got tighter i went into denial			0
i used every excuse possible to justify my weight gain , from the shop sizing being wrong , to saying i was a size 12 - even though deep down i knew i was nearer a 16			1
' the more i told people the more i believed it			0
' in denial : @entity5 said she would squeeze into smaller dress sizes rather than admit she was a size 16 @entity5 noticed her weight gain once her clothes began to get tighter and she began to wear baggier outfits @entity5 became more and more self concious about her weight and began to worry about what other people may think			1
' i was n’t confident at all and i used to be paranoid that people were staring at me and saying things about my weight in the street			0
' i used to hide myself under unflatterly black and baggy clothes which is not what a young woman in her 20s wants to be wearing			0
' @entity5 did attempt to lose weight but admits that she was a yo - yo dieter and would start a crash diet before getting bored and bingeing on her favourite food			1
' it was a vicious cycle and i was always using the classic excuse " the diet starting on monday "			0
' but it was @entity4 who finally motivated @entity5 to lose a three stone in just three months			1
before she lost weight : @entity4 followed the @entity94 plan help her drop to a size 10 ' i had no idea how i was going to try and lose the weight until i came across some pictures of @entity4			1
' i followed her on @entity100 and think she is gorgeous			0
i saw she posted lots of pictures about her weight loss and it really inspired me			2
' instead of her regular diet of high fat and salty foods , @entity5 took after @entity4 and gave the @entity30 a go			1
she swapped crisps , sandwiches and chocolate for three soups , shakes , and porridge meals a day as well as swapping her beloved diet coke for three litres of water			0
@entity5 is now a slender 9 stone 5lb , having dropped three dress sizes and now fitting comfortably into a size 10 , which matches @entity121 's size			1
since reaching her goal weight @entity5 and fiance @entity44 ( pictured ) have started planning their wedding in @entity126 ' i can not express what an amazing journey @entity94 has been , ' says @entity5 , ' since the age of 15 i 've never been below 10st 5lbs so to be in the 9 stone bracket is a dream come true			2
' i am delighted to be a size 10 in my favourite stores and i finally feel confident and comfortable in myself			2

' i am so much happier now			0
i have been planning my wedding with my fiance			0
' @entity5 who is engaged to 26 - year - old @entity140 , will get married in @entity126 in september			2
