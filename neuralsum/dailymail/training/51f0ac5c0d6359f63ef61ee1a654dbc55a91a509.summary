husbands who constantly criticise their wives over their weight or appearance may be guilty of domestic abuse , a @entity1 frontbencher has suggested			1
@entity7 , @entity1 ’s new shadow anti domestic violence minister , said such abuse could be part of a wider pattern of ‘ controlling behaviour ’ which can be as bad as a physical attack			1

she told @entity31 that one woman she spoke to had been forced to flee her home after her husband attempted to control her entire life			2
but she said it started with him criticising her appearance			2
the @entity1 mp said : ‘ she felt traumatised			2
for this woman her journey – her nightmare – started out with him making these comments about her appearance and progressed to wanting to control what she looked like and where she went until he had total control over her			2
’ @entity49 has responsibility for countering domestic violence in the @entity52 ms @entity7 said she was not talking about arguments between couples or snide remarks made in anger , but a wider pattern of behaviour which leads to abuse			1
