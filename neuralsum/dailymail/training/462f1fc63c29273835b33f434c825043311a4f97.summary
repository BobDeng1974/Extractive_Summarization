by @entity0 for @entity1 for @entity3 , this was the most brutal of comedowns after the high of his @entity7 call - up			1
the 21 - year - old spoke for the entire @entity10 dressing room when he summed up the feeling of utter dejection in the wake of a dismal defeat against @entity15			1
the chance of @entity19 group stage action - and the accompanying £ 15million financial influx - seemed at their fingertips following a 1 - 1 draw in @entity22 last week			1
yet @entity10 proved toothless for the most part in the return and were undone when @entity26 @entity25 struck the most painful of blows with 15 minutes remaining			1
that it came after some truly flimsy defending , not an isolated incident this season , made it all the more difficult for @entity30 and his players to bear			0
devastating : @entity10 midfielder @entity3 ( centre ) was devastated after the 1 - 0 loss to @entity15 stunned : @entity10 @entity35 ( left ) and @entity36 are dejected after the latter missed a late chance winner : @entity15 's @entity25 ( centre ) scored the goal that knocked @entity10 out of the @entity19 admirably , @entity3 was first out to face the media in the interview marquee erected outside @entity44			1
on the other side of the canvas , a couple of hundred fans had massed in front of the main entrance to chant ‘ @entity52 ’ and direct more personal ire at chief executive @entity51			0
the recriminations and fall - out will linger for days to come			2
on tuesday night , however , it was the immediate pain of defeat that hurt so deeply for @entity3 and his colleagues			1
‘ it ’s just devastating , ’ said the @entity44 youngster			1
‘ it ’s a really tough one to take			2
the dressing room was silent at the end			0
we could n’t believe it			0
in the second half , we had a few chances but then we got sucker - punched at the other end			2
‘ the feeling now is a mix of everything - anger and frustration			2
as i said , it is devastating			2
all the boys are absolutely gutted			2
‘ i ’m obviously delighted to be part of the first team but it is hard to be happy when things like that happen			0
the @entity19 was massive for the club			1
but it also meant everything to all the staff and the players			0
party time : @entity25 ( centre ) celebrates scoring goal that sent the @entity22 side into the group stage ‘ we will just have to work hard to try to get better			1
we will look to get better over the course of this season and come back and try to qualify next season			0
‘ a good week for me has ended quite badly			2
it ’s good to get that recognition from the @entity7 squad so i will just keep working hard and try to keep myself in the @entity10 team			1
’ there was understandable apprehension before kick - off but few in a near - capacity crowd expected events to unfold quite the way they did on the @entity44 pitch			1
@entity15 pressed @entity10 much higher than in the first leg and knocked @entity30 ’s system out of sync			1
@entity3 struck the bar early in the second half but , in truth , the @entity22 always looked the more likely scorers			1
from a huge roar at kick - off , the noise around the stadium gradually morphed into one of anxiety and bitter frustration			1
‘ were we edgy ? it felt like that a wee bit , ’ admitted @entity3			1
‘ they were happy to sit in and defend and that made it difficult for us to try and break down			0
‘ once they managed to get a few shots on target the crowd start to get on your back a bit and it becomes difficult again			0
not happy : @entity10 fans protest after their side were knocked out of the @entity19 here we go ! the @entity15 bench celebrate as the @entity22 stun the @entity136 champions ‘ but i thought the boys managed to regroup quite well at half time			1
we threw pretty much everything we had at them and we were unlucky at some points			0
@entity36 ( @entity36 ) had a couple of efforts and i had one that hit the bar			0
you can say we were a wee bit unlucky there but you have to defend well at the other end as well			0
‘ we had an advantage from the first leg and i think everyone expected us to go through tonight			0
but we conceded a sloppy goal when we were trying to get the winner and maybe we should just have sat and taken the advantage we already had			2
’ having seen a @entity19 reprieve slip away , @entity10 are left grasping at the consolation prize provided by the @entity158			1
the hope for @entity30 is that his team can develop in the same way @entity162 ’s did when they were involved in the secondary competition three years ago			0
‘ we did n’t play well against @entity164 and now we have been knocked out tonight , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ maybe the @entity158 is a stepping stone for us to get better as a squad and come back stronger next year			2
‘ @entity162 ’s team did quite well in a @entity158 campaign a few years ago			0
obviously it is hard when a new manager takes over			0
he is trying to implant his ideas and his own kind of work ethic into the team			0
that is going to take time			0
at a big club like @entity10 you do n’t have a lot of time			2
you have to get the results along with the performances and the progression			0
maybe the @entity158 will give us that platform to improve as a team			0
’ talking to : the @entity15 fans are spoken to by police at @entity44 as their side			1

@entity3 was ' gutted ' by @entity10 's 2 - 1 aggregate loss to @entity15
@entity10 will miss out on £ 15m after failing to reach @entity19 groups
it is a bitter - *sweet* week for @entity3 as he was called up to @entity7 squad
@entity26 @entity25 scored the only goal in @entity15 's 1 - 0 at @entity44
@entity3 describes defeat as ' devastating ' and ' really tough to take '
