one of the @entity1 samaritans sought by investigators has come forward after an appeal was launched to identify fans who tended to the wounded as they lay dying on the pitch at the 1989 disaster			1
the man was located after @entity9 launched the appeal on thursday morning in the hope that the supporters might be able to supply crucial evidence for the ongoing inquest			2
photographs which show the men and woman rushing towards those crushed in the tragedy were released , with investigators urging anyone who recognises them to come forward			1
they form part of an ongoing @entity24 inquiry aiming to establish whether any individual or organisation was to blame for the disaster which claimed the lives of 96 @entity30 fans			1
investigators have released these images of football fans who were pictured carrying the wounded on stretchers and tending to others at the 1989 @entity1 disaster police say the ' unusual ' appeal is necessary as those photographed may be able to answer questions of the victims ' families issued on behalf of the coroner sir @entity46 , the people in the photographs may be able to tell victims ' families ' more about how they died , officials said			1
' it is important to stress that we believe these people can help the coroner ’s inquest process , ' said assistant commissioner @entity54 of @entity9 , the police force set up to look into the disaster			1
' i know these pictures are 26 years old but if anyone does recognise the people we need to speak to then i would urge them to get in touch immediately			0
' there are still many questions that the families of the 96 have and we believe that these people may be able to provide answers to some of those questions			2
' ninety - six people died at the disaster after @entity30 fans in one section of the football grounds became crushed			2
previous inquests which recorded conclusions of accidental death were thrown out at the @entity79 in 2012 after years of campaigning by the families of those killed			0
the home secretary @entity82 launched a fresh probe into the disaster the same year			2
investigators hope members of the public may recognise some of those pictured in the appeal while the images are 26 years old , investigators believe they may help track down key witnesses			0

anyone with information about those pictured is urged to contact @entity9 officers while officers said it was ' unusual ' to carry out such appeals as today 's while legal proceedings are active they invited anyone who recognised the people photographed to make contact			1
' i have a team of highly trained staff in place who will deal with witnesses sensitively as we understand how difficult some people will find this , ' added mr @entity54			0
' the @entity9 website also contains useful contacts should members of the public require welfare assistance			2
' it is unusual to carry out an appeal of this nature during an ongoing legal process such as the inquests and for that reason i urge people to remember the warning issued by the coroner at the start of the fresh inquests , which he reiterated in february 2014			0
' i also urge people to consider the advisory notice issued by the attorney general ’s office on 10 march 2014			0
' it is really important that people do not pass comment on our appeal or any other aspect of the @entity1 disaster on social media and forums			0
' among those to have already given evidence at the inquest in @entity164 are the families of those killed and police officers working at the time			0
