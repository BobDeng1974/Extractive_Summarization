an ' average - looking ' doll , complete with acne and stretch marks , has gone on sale this morning after a successful crowdfunding campaign			1
artist @entity5 , 26 , from @entity6 , @entity7 , created ' @entity8 ' based on government measurements of an average 19 - year - old @entity11 woman , wanting to offer an alternative to @entity13 and other fashion dolls that perpetuate outrageously unrealistic beauty standards			1
' i think a realistic sized doll is important because , when i look at current dolls on the market , i ca n’t help but notice how disproportionate they are , ' mr @entity5 told @entity21			1
a variety of stylish ensembles , all inspired by cosmopolitan cities such as @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 , are sold separately			0
but her most unusual accessory is a $ 6 packet of @entity48 - a selection of 38 reusable stickers that resemble acne , cellulite , freckles , moles , stitches , scrapes , bruises , mosquito bites and other imperfections			2
after mr @entity5 launched a crowdfunding campaign in march , 13,621 backers pre-ordered more than 19,000 dolls totaling $ 501,384			1
thick skin : the doll even has a stick - on scar , in case she suffers any pretend injuries sold separately : @entity69 , which cost $ 6 , include 38 reusable stickers that resemble freckles , moles , bruises and other imperfections each model features average proportions of a typical 19 - year - old girl ( 32 - 31 - 33 ) , a light amount of make - up and bendy joints			1
if the dolls are a success , he plans to extend the range to ' embrace diversity , from race to body type			0
' in his research , mr @entity5 found that , scaled up to human size , @entity13 dolls would have unrealistic measurements of 36 - 18 - 33 , compared with the typical 19 - year - old girl 's 32 - 31 - 33			1
what 's more , while the average 19 - year - old is a modest 5ft 4 " tall , @entity13 would have a supermodel stature and would be a relatively lofty 5ft 8 "			1
thanks to her ultra-slender measurements , it has been estimated that , if she were to exist as a human , @entity13 would weigh about 110lbs and would have a @entity104 of 16.24			0
this would fit the weight criteria for anorexia , as a healthy @entity104 range is between 18.5 and 24.9			0
average teen : mr @entity5 created lammily based on government measurements of a real 19 - year - old @entity11 woman crumbs and all : he wanted to offer an alternative to @entity13 and other fashion dolls that perpetuate outrageously unrealistic beauty standards mr @entity5 's hope is to promote a more positive body image to children			1
' i wanted to show that average is beautiful			0
rather than waiting for change to happen , let 's be the change , ' he says in a @entity125 video for his crowdfunding campaign			0
he concludes : ' [ it 's ] so that our girls can grow up to become happier , stronger women , truly confident and proud in their own bodies			0
' mr @entity5 consulted with @entity132 , former vice president of manufacturing at @entity133 , for advice on finding a suitable manufacturer to produce his @entity8 line			2
frustrated : ' i think a realistic sized doll is important because , when i look at current dolls on the market , i ca n’t help but notice how disproportionate they are , ' he said woman of the world : a variety of stylish ensembles , inspired by cosmopolitan cities such as @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity147 ( pictured ) , are sold separately while the production process took months to figure out , mr @entity5 said the biggest challenge will be getting children to go for something new			1
attempts at average - sized dolls in the past have not been successful , he says , but he believes that 's because the ' average size ' message was n't appealing to kids			2
' it would be like me trying to feed them broccoli , ' he joked to @entity163			0
instead the entrepreneur wants children to see ' a cool - looking doll ' and he will not push the ' average - looking ' message too hard			2
in demand : after mr @entity5 launched a crowdfunding campaign in march , 13,621 backers pre-ordered more than 19,000 dolls curvy girl : scaled to human size , @entity8 would have measurements of 32 - 31 - 33 , while tiny - waisted @entity13 's proportions would be 36 - 18 - 33 the public appear to be supportive of mr @entity5 's empowering goal			1
