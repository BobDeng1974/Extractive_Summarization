a mother who left her 12 - year - old son in the care of a family friend when she went on a trip to @entity5 was dragged to court accused of child neglect and cruelty			1
the woman , who can not be named for legal reasons , was eventually cleared by a @entity11 judge but said the episode had torn her family apart and left her battling depression			2
the boy , now 14 , was taken away from his family and was allowed to see his mother only under supervision seven times in the 11 months before the trial			2
now he has decided to remain living with a relative 300 miles away after starting his gcse studies and settling in to a new school			2
the mother of a 12 - year - old boy left home alone while she holidayed in @entity5 has had the case against her dropped but her son still does n't want to live with her ; she is pictured above with her husband , the boy 's step father - neither of them can be identified @entity32 have criticised the decision to prosecute the mother and have called on the government to issue specific guidance on leaving children home alone			1
currently the law fails to explain at what age or for how long a child can be left on their own			0
but parents face prosecution if they are deemed to have put a child at risk by leaving them unsupervised			0
the family ’s saga began two years ago when the youngster declined to join his mother and stepfather on a trip to sort out some issues with a holiday home they own in @entity55			0
instead they arranged for the ‘ independent , intelligent young man ’ to be cared for by a ‘ long - standing family friend ’			0
the couple are now seeking compensation and an apology from social services over the case however , the couple discovered that the boy had spent two nights alone , while he had told his teachers that he did not know who was meant to be looking after him			1
while they were away , the couple , one a teacher , the other a former social worker , received a phone call from police saying they would be questioned under caution over child neglect on their return			1
the parents rushed home but they were arrested and the boy was sent to live with a relative by the authorities			1
the law does not give an age when children can be left alone			0
but parents can be prosecuted under the @entity87 for wilful neglect if they leave a child unsupervised ‘ in a manner likely to cause unnecessary suffering or injury to health ’ – a definition which police and social services are left to interpret			1
punishment can range from a fine to ten years ’ imprisonment			0
when the case was finally heard at @entity101 , judge @entity99 directed the jury to return not - guilty verdicts			1
he said the man tasked with looking after the boy had given inconsistent evidence and that in other circumstances there was no suggestion the couple had been anything other than excellent parents			1
the mother told @entity114 : ‘ i will have to live the rest of my life with this			0
it was so unnecessary and cruel ... one of the hardest things is seeing the children getting off the school bus every afternoon and my son not being among them			2
’ the boy is still in regular contact with his mother by phone and email but sees her only in the school holidays			2
@entity131 mp @entity130 has tabled a parliamentary question asking the government to issue guidance on when children can be left on their own and for how long			0
he said : ‘ in this case the parents had done everything to make sure their child was looked after , so why did it take two years to work out they had n’t done anything wrong ? ’ the @entity141 said : ‘ the law is clear that parents can be prosecuted if they leave a child unsupervised in a manner likely to cause unnecessary suffering or injury to health			0
