by @entity0 in @entity1 and @entity2 published : 06:58 est , 2 january 2014 updated : 11:36 est , 2 january 2014 the family of brain dead @entity4 is receiving financial help from the @entity9 foundation the parents of @entity4 are receiving financial backing from a foundation started by another family famous for their battle to keep their child on life support			1
the @entity18 has been working with relatives of the 13 - year - old @entity21 girl , who was declared brain - dead after tonsil surgery , to get her moved to a care facility			1
@entity4 suffered complications after having her tonsils removed , causing her heart to stop and massive brain damage that the hospital say is so severe that she is effectively dead			1
the case of @entity9 became famous in the late 1990s and early 2000s when her husband attempted to remove her feeding tube against the wishes of her parents			1
@entity9 had suffered a heart attack in 1990 after which her husband cared for her , until 1998 when he filed a petition to have her feeding tube removed			2
@entity9 claimed that it was his wife 's wish to ' pull the plug ' , and after several years fighting her family in court , @entity40 's feeding tube was removed in 2005			1
@entity9 's parents set up the foundation in 2001 to fight for @entity40 's case and now the organisation is devoted to helping families of incapacitated patients facing a loss of life support			1
@entity4 underwent a tonsillectomy at @entity52 last month to treat sleep apnea			1
her mother @entity54 , believes her daughter can recover and is fighting plans to turn off her ventilator , on @entity59 , the family won a last - minute injunction to keep @entity4 alive until january 7			1
speaking exclusively to @entity61 , she said watching her daughter suffering will haunt her forever			2
' my daughter started to bleed and that will scar me forever because it happened in front of my face , in front of my mother ’s face , in front of my husband ’s face , ' she said on a break in the grounds of @entity52 , @entity1 , @entity21			1
' she was very scared			2
she knew something was wrong			2
to see your daughter like that is just heartbreaking			2
' but i still have hope			2
in fact i have more than hope			2
i am positive my daughter is going to wake up			0
i do n’t have a doubt			0
i talk to her about it all the time			0
' grief : @entity87 and @entity54 react as they speak to the @entity61 outside of @entity52 in @entity1 on january 1 , 2014 tragic : this is @entity4 's eight grade photograph ( left ) and another school photograph is seen ( right ) - the happy teen suffered brain damage after complications from routine surgery to remove her tonsils in early december mrs @entity96 , 34 , a @entity97 worker , was comforted by her husband @entity87 , 33 , a truck driver , as she sat on the wall outside the hospital which she has not left since december 9th when the complications occurred			1
' i never knew i would have to fight a hospital to treat my daughter , ' she said			1
' i find it unbelievable			0
i have not been home since december 9th , i have been sleeping in the waiting room			0
i can not leave @entity4			1
' she said that the way the hospital has treated her daughter and the family has been ' disgusting '			1
' the way the hospital has behaved towards me is outrageous			1
' they do n’t even refer to her by name			0
they refer to her as the deceased , or the body , or the dead and my daughter is not dead			1
' they are awful , they have no compassion			0
' backing : @entity9 was at the center of a right - to - life debate that captivated the @entity124 for several years in the late 90s and early 2000s , and a foundation set up in her name is supporting @entity4 's family mrs @entity54 , who has three other children , said all she wanted to do was get her daughter away from the hospital to a place that cared for her			1
' the doctors here pretty much want my daughter gone ' , she said			0
' i want the same thing but i want her out of here alive , they want her out of here dead			1
' i blame the hospital for what happened			1
they should say ‘ hey let ’s do what ’s right for this little girl , we messed her up , we owe her , the least we can do is let her get out of here ’			0
' she said she feels a mixture of anger , sadness and guilt			0
' i feel angry at the hospital , ' she said			2
' sad for my daughter and guilty because i made her have the operation			0
' she told me not to make her have the operation			0
she said her worst fear was never waking up , that ’s what she told me			0
that is why i feel guilty			0
' i just wished i had picked a different hospital			2
when i first heard things had gone wrong , i passed out from shock			0
' wedding : this photograph shows @entity4 ( right ) at the wedding of her step - father @entity164 ( 2nd right ) to her mother @entity166 ( not pictured ) - also in this photograph are @entity168 ( left ) and her grandmother @entity169 ( 2nd left ) tragedy : @entity4 , 13 , was declared legally brain - dead after undergoing a routine tonsil removal that dosctors suggested as a means of eliminating her sleep apnea she said she was puzzled why the hospital was blocking the family ’s bid to move @entity4			1
' i think they are trying to cover up something and i think they would rather she dies than i prove them wrong that she is alive , ' she said			0
one of the issues is that the hospital is refusing to fit a feeding tube to the patient as they say they do n’t operate on dead people			1
the operation must be carried out before a care facility can take her in			0
' i do n’t believe what the hospital are saying , ' said mrs @entity54 , adding that she believes her daughter is not getting the best treatment as she is not an organ donor			2
i just have to keep faith			0
i just want to get her away from here			0
they do n’t want her here			0
' that ’s why they are not feeding her , that ’s why they do n’t refer to her by her name			0
that ’s why they call her the deceased			0
' @entity201 , the spokesman for the hospital , said that the family ’s lawyer @entity203 was cruelly perpetuating the ' hoax ' that @entity4 was still alive			1
he said it was a terribly sad case but that three doctors and the courts had agreed that there was no hope for the girl			2
although @entity4 's family is receiving support from the @entity9 foundation , @entity52 spokesman @entity212 says it has not heard from any facility .			1
