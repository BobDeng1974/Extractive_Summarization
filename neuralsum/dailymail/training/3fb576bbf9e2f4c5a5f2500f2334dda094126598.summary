by @entity0 published : 14:01 est , 28 january 2013 updated : 14:02 est , 28 january 2013 a new flag has been designed in @entity2 in a bid to ' move on ' from the country 's colonial past			1
military historian dr @entity7 , of the @entity8 , came up with the idea because he says the current one does not embrace all aspects of @entity2 culture			1
rather than just a straightforward nod to the country 's @entity15 heritage , he says he wanted a flag that acknowledge @entity2 's @entity19 communities as well as its growing multiculturalism			1
' people can identify with various parts of it and see that @entity2 is actually a multicultural place with a rich history that reaches back for generations , ' he told the @entity27			1
multicultural : dr @entity7 's flag contains 250 dots to represent the many @entity19 dialects as well as the immigrant languages spoken on the streets of @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 and other towns and cities across the nation his flag contains 250 dots to the left to represent the many @entity19 dialects as well as the immigrant languages spoken on the streets of @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 and other towns and cities across the nation			1
there is also a red section in the shape of a boomerang , and a traditional representation in green and yellow of the @entity56 constellation , made up of five stars â€“ one small five - pointed star and four , larger , seven - pointed stars			1
how it looks now : the current @entity2 flag has a @entity61 in the top left corner and the @entity56 constellation , made up of five stars - one small five - pointed star and four , larger , seven - pointed stars but he says he did not want to completely disregard modern @entity2 's @entity15 roots and added a white stripe to ' echo ' that on the @entity61			1
' we can move on , we can reflect on our history but also acknowledge in the design ... that we ca n't completely trash the @entity15 heritage , ' he added			2
' i get the significance of the current flag , i get the significance of the @entity61			1
i also get that a lot of people do n't like it			2
i think we need to find a compromise , something that is going to be inclusive and appeals to all @entity2			2
' @entity2 author and former rugby union player @entity85 backed calls for a new flag , saying the current one ' is no longer a symbol that unites us ( but ) it divides us '			2
' why on earth , in the 21st century , do we still have a flag that reserves 25 per cent of its acreage proclaiming our allegiance , first and foremost , to @entity97 ! ? ' he wrote in the @entity98			2
' you ca n't believe in multiculturalism and support a flag that asserts the primacy of the @entity104 race			2
we need a flag that reflects the equality of our citizens , not vaunts one lot over other			0
' anger : the new flag offering comes two days after a group of @entity19 protesters set fire to the @entity2 flag outside the country 's @entity115 in @entity117 as the rest of the nation celebrated @entity120 the new flag offering comes two days after a group of @entity19 protesters set fire to the @entity2 flag outside the country 's @entity115 in @entity117 as the rest of the nation celebrated @entity120			1
a video captured showed protesters outside @entity115 setting light to the flag and spitting on it while chanting , ' @entity125 was , always will be @entity19 land			1
' a day before that , riot police were called to form a human shield around prime minister @entity135 and escort her out of a @entity117 restaurant after hundreds of angry protesters surrounded the building			0
@entity2 's national flag has remained a controversial issue ever since its invention in 1901			0
@entity2 's 460,000 aborigines make up two per cent of the 21 million population , most living in remote communities or towns			0
contentious : the @entity2 and @entity19 flags are held by dancing aborigines in traditional decorations from the urabalan area in the @entity150 but for around 50,000 years , prior to the arrival of @entity153 in 1788 , the country was occupied exclusively by @entity19 and @entity155 peoples			1
both tribes have their own flags			0
protests : on saturday , deputy prime minister @entity159 reignited the debate around whether @entity2 should become a republic , saying the 80 - year - old @entity163 cricket scandal had shown that the @entity15 could be ruthless , self - serving and mean - spirited the aboriginal flag is red and black with a yellow sun at its centre while the @entity155 's flag is green , blue and black with a white star at its centre surrounded by a white dhari ( dancer 's headdress )			1
both were finally recognised by the @entity2 government in 1995 when it granted them @entity176 status , under the @entity177			0
on friday , deputy prime minister @entity159 reignited the debate around whether @entity2 should become a republic , saying the 80 - year - old @entity163 cricket scandal had shown that the @entity15 could be ' ruthless ' and self serving			0
he said the @entity182 cricket team 's ' life - threatening ' bowling tactics during the 1932 @entity163 ' woke @entity2 up ' to renounce @entity97 's self - serving ' gentlemanly values '			0
' what the bodyline series showed			0
' he wrote in a newspaper piece to coincide with @entity120 , ' was that while we refuse to put on airs and graces , @entity2 are not a ruthless , ' whatever it takes ' people , ' he wrote			0
the push for @entity2 to become a republic has fallen out of the spotlight since the loss of a referendum on the issue in 1999			0
however some polls show a possible resurgence in the idea			0
a 2010 @entity201 that asked : ' do you think @entity2 should have a new design for our @entity204 ? ' was supported by 29 per cent of respondents and opposed by 66 percent , with 5 per cent uncommitted .			0
