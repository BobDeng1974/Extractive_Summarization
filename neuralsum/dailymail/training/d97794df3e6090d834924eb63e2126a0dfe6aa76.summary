by @entity1 reporter researchers say it is possible to repair a chronically diseased liver by forcing mature liver cells to ' go back in time ' to a stem cell - like state			1
switching off a liver - growth pathway in mature cells generates high levels of dedifferentiation , which means the cells can revert back to an unspecialized state and regenerate a diseased liver			2
the breakthrough , published in the journal @entity17 , could pave the way for liver cell transplants to cure genetic liver disorders			1
cell transition : scientists say when the @entity24 pathway is inactivated , mature liver cells revert back to a stem cell - like state			1
this picture shows a group of cells transitioning from a mature cell type ( green ) to a stem cell type ( red )			0
white cells are the cells where @entity24 is being inactivated research lead : @entity35 ( pictured ) is an associate professor in the @entity36 of @entity17 and @entity37 @entity39 scientists at @entity40 made the discovery while investigating whether a biochemical cascade called @entity24 , which controls how big the liver grows , also affects cell fate			1
switching off the @entity24 - signaling pathway in mature liver cells means they become stem - cell like again , allowing them to give rise to functional progenitor cells that can regenerate a diseased liver			1
' i think this study highlights the tremendous plasticity of mature liver cells , ' research lead @entity35 said , according to @entity55			0
' it 's not that you have a very small population of cells that can be recruited to an injury ; almost 80 percent of hepatocytes [ liver cells ] can undergo this cell fate change			2
' @entity35 's team studied mice born with a genetic liver disease			0
they cultured healthy liver progenitor cells and transplanted them into the diseased mice			0
over about four months , the transplanted liver cells engrafted and the animals ' condition improved			0
' people have been trying to use liver cell transplants for metabolic diseases since the early 90s , but because of the source of cells - discarded livers -- they were unsuccessful , ' @entity35 said			2
' with this unlimited source of cells from a patient , we think that perhaps it 's time to think again about doing hepatocyte or progenitor cell transplants in the context of liver genetic disorders			0

@entity39 researchers were studying whether the hippo - signaling pathway , which controls how big the liver grows , also affects cell fate
they found that switching off the pathway in mature liver cells makes them stem cells again
a stem cell is an unspecialized cell that gives rise to specialized cells
these stem cells can *quickly* dedifferentiate to regenerate a diseased liver
the finding could pave the way for liver cell transplants to cure genetic liver disorders
