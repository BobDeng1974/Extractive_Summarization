@entity0 prides himself on being the @entity2 ' bogeyman in the @entity3			1
' i 'm regularly voted their least popular @entity3 member , ' he says with his familiar hangdog smile			2
just as @entity8 and @entity9 privately describe @entity10 as a ' closet conservative ' , they regard @entity13 politician			1
not surprising , since he once was a @entity13 politician , albeit a councillor , in the 1970s			1
with @entity0 in charge of @entity13 's spending plans , voters would stop worrying that would - be pm @entity20 might do something barmy			1
but as we sit on the terrace of the quirkily named @entity36 pub by the @entity37 in his @entity39 constituency , @entity32 says something , which on first hearing , sounds even more barmy			0
not only is he ready to spend another five years helping the @entity2 run @entity42 , he wants to replace @entity9 as chancellor			1
' yes , i know , ' he shrugs , acknowledging the apparent contradiction , ' i 've spent my whole political life fighting the conservatives			2
' how does he sit down with @entity2 he privately despises ? ' when we have a business meeting we put the guns at the door and sit down and talk , ' he smiles			1
he complains of ' nasty and vicious stuff ' from the @entity2			1
and after one heated @entity3 verbal exchange with defence secretary @entity57 , @entity8 rushed up to @entity0 on his way out and begged him to keep it secret to stop the @entity3 collapsing			1
he describes another confrontation with junior @entity18 business minister @entity61 , an ally of @entity9 sent to ' spy ' on cable			2
' he came to my office with a list of plum jobs he wanted			0
i said , ' no , i 'm the boss			0
' he was very cross , stamped his feet , got up and slammed the door			0
' so how , and more to the point , why , does cable want another five years of more of the same ? ' because i 've realised it is possible to be business - like with them			1
i can envisage a scenario in which i would stomach working with the @entity2 if the situation required			1
you have to let your head rule your heart			2
' in the interview , mr @entity0 said the prime minister and the chancellor were ' highly intelligent guys ' and added that they ' do n't snarl at each other ' he knows full well the significance of what he is saying			2
' it 's important coming from me because i 'm the one seen as having the least affinity with the @entity2			1
' cable is also quick to make clear he does not rule out working with @entity13			1
but he ' envisages ' remaining in a government led by @entity8 , not @entity20			1
cable says he would stop ' the nasty tail of right - wing mps wagging the @entity18 dog ' if @entity8 scrapes home			1
he denounces ' horrendous ' public spending cuts proposed by @entity8 and @entity9 – ' almost all affecting the disabled and working poor '			1
but with @entity0 , the difference is strictly political , not personal			0
in the next breath he says : ' @entity8 and @entity9 are highly intelligent guys and i respect their abilities			1
i have perfectly affable discussions with them			0
we do n't snarl at each other			0
' his warm words for the @entity2 are all the more remarkable , bearing in mind that , around the corner , conservative chiefs have sent extra teams of canvassers to @entity39 to try to ' decapitate ' cable			1
no one seriously thinks they can overturn his 12,000 majority			0
giving a timely reminder to local @entity2 in his middle - class constituency , home of the chaps of the @entity124 and @entity125 , of his fondness for @entity127 and @entity9 will do him no harm			1
they do n't call him a wily old fox for nothing			0
his criticism of @entity20 is all the more wounding , sounding like a disappointed father or headmaster			0
his warm words for the @entity2 are all the more remarkable , bearing in mind that , around the corner , conservative chiefs have sent extra teams of canvassers to @entity39 to try to ' decapitate ' mr cable ' he could have done so much better and has made two really big mistakes			1
he should have said up - front on the financial crisis that we [ the last @entity145 ] screwed up seriously and done a mea culpa			2
' and i feel let down by his foolish plan to cut university tuition fees to £ 6,000			0
it is a low - grade response			2
he could n't resist a cheap soundbite at our expense			0
and his fiscal policy is so vague			0
' two days after the election , @entity0 celebrates his 72nd birthday			0
tall , tanned and languid , he looks lithe enough to reprise his dainty - toed appearance in @entity160 in 2010			2
yet , audaciously , the evergreen septuagenarian has set his sights on a new star turn – chancellor in a @entity18 - led @entity145			1
' i 'm up for having a substantial role			0
my prime interest is the economy			0
there are two economic departments in @entity171 and i 've done one of them for five years			0
i 'll leave you to do the maths ! ' it sounds highly unlikely			0
certainly less likely than a @entity179 leadership contest if , as some predict , @entity10 loses his seat			2
cable loyally insists his party boss will survive and vehemently denies he wants his job			0
but canny cable ca n't resist pointing out : ' i 'm quite a bit younger than @entity186 , @entity187 and @entity188			0
' all three led governments in their eighth decade			2
we can do the maths , @entity21 .			0

@entity179 mp said he 's realised it 's ' possible to be business - like ' with @entity2
envisaged scenario where he could ' stomach ' working with conservatives
but also quick to make clear he does not rule out working with @entity13
thought he was most likely to remain in a government led by mr @entity8
