by @entity0 it was the greatest party @entity2 had ever seen			1
as jubilant crowds flocked on to the streets to celebrate the end of the @entity7 in @entity8 , few noticed a young princess @entity9 and her sister @entity10 dancing incognito among them			2
but while the future @entity9 did indeed do the conga through @entity14 hotel in @entity15 , a new film is set to claim she also danced in sleazy @entity17 nightclubs – and ended the night being kissed by a dashing young @entity19 gunner			1
@entity20 is bound to raise eyebrows as , in real life , princess @entity9 , then 19 , was besotted by @entity23 , who was serving in the @entity24 with the @entity25			1
rebellious ? @entity26 ( centre ) as princess @entity9 in @entity28 with her sister @entity10 ( @entity30 ) and her father @entity31 ( @entity32 ) the real @entity33 : princess @entity9 , @entity34 ( later the @entity35 ) , @entity31 and @entity10 the film , which stars @entity32 as @entity31 , @entity37 as @entity9 , @entity26 as princess @entity9 and @entity30 as @entity10 , recounts the dramatic events on @entity39 – may 8 , 1945			1
according to the ‘ fairytale ’ account by @entity42 and @entity43 , after @entity9 and @entity10 , then 15 , join in the fun at @entity14 , the younger princess slips away from her guards and hops on a bus			1
‘ princess @entity9 has a race against time to find her , ’ says mr @entity42 , who was also responsible for @entity50 drama @entity48 and the @entity52 biopic @entity53			2
‘ when she gets on a @entity2 bus – something she has no clue how to use – she meets an @entity59 serviceman who comes to her rescue			1
‘ he is a @entity19 gunner who has had a pretty tough time of it and debates whether he is going to go @entity64 or will return to his base the next morning			0
royal show : @entity26 ( @entity9 ) ( r ) and @entity30 ( @entity67 ) ( @entity68 ) spotted filming scenes from @entity20 in @entity70 in their finest : @entity10 , played by @entity30 , wore a fur trimmed pink coat with @entity9 pictured to her left celebrations : @entity39 was a public holiday which saw thousands take to the streets to party as they try to find @entity10 , they end up in a couple of sleazy @entity17 nightclubs			1
she does help him and as a consequence of that her real identity is revealed			0
’ with filming already under way at @entity86 in @entity87 and @entity88 in @entity89 , mr @entity42 admits the decision about whether the future queen will be shown sharing a romantic kiss with the young gunner is under debate			0
indeed , film companies @entity95 and @entity97 , which produced the critically acclaimed mrs @entity98 – about the relationship between @entity9 @entity100 and her manservant @entity101 – plan to shoot alternative endings and will not make a decision on which to include until closer to the film ’s release date next year			1
while mr @entity42 insists the film will be ‘ a respectful ’ retelling of an event which had huge importance in the @entity9 ’s life , some @entity107 watchers are less impressed			1
royal biographer @entity113 said : ‘ if it ’s pure fiction it ’s not a good idea			0
a film that mixes fact and fiction is a cop - out			2
’ but @entity121 , editor of majesty magazine , said : ‘ with the success of @entity126 and @entity9 , it is a good time to do a bit of @entity113 movie - making			2
' @entity10 ' was pictured walking past what appeared to be a makeshift butcher during filming in @entity70 party princess : before prince @entity133 there was @entity10 - who attended many a party in her time leading ladies : @entity26 ( @entity68 ) plays @entity9 while @entity30 ( r ) is younger sister @entity10 celebrations : londoners on @entity39 in 1945			1
may 8 was the day the capital turned into a giant party ‘ the fact that the makers are debating whether princess @entity9 should be kissed show me they are very conscious of how they portray the story			2
there has to be a bit of poetic licence			0
’ in her diary entry , @entity9 wrote of the night : ‘ cheered parents on balcony			2
up to @entity15 , great fun			0
' we walked through the streets , a line of unknown people linking arms and walking down @entity158 , swept along on a tide of happiness			0
’ the sisters returned to the @entity107 in the early hours having maintained their anonymity , but were so caught up in the excitement that they ventured out again the next day			0
@entity9 ’s diary for may 9 says : ‘ @entity165 , @entity15 , @entity166 , walked simply miles			0
saw parents on balcony at 12.30am – ate , partied , bed 3am ! ’ looking back at their adventure , the @entity9 ’s cousin @entity170 , who acted as their chaperone on @entity39 , admitted : ‘ it was a unique burst of personal freedom			0
a @entity178 moment in reverse in which they could pretend they were ordinary and unknown			0
’ however , she never mentioned a kiss			0
a day to remember : more than a million people took to the streets including in @entity2 's @entity185 meet and greet : on may 9 princess @entity9 greeted the crowds while touring the @entity187 of @entity2			1

@entity20 raises eyebrows - as she was already besotted with @entity23
' @entity192 ' account sees @entity9 lose her guards and hop on a @entity2 bus
film stars @entity32 as @entity31 and filming is already underway
