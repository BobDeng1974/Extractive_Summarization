by @entity0 published : 16:00 est , 19 october 2013 updated : 16:01 est , 19 october 2013 living with chronic pain can be intolerable			1
you feel desperate to do something , anything , to stop the pain but whatever you try seems to fail			1
and much as you try to distract yourself , one thought dominates : it hurts			0
being in pain is not only physical but also a mental battle against the painful sensations , wishing them away and trying to endure them			1
but doctors now think that struggling like this actually makes your suffering worse			0
in fact , the latest medical advances show that accepting and exploring sensations of pain and illness can bring more powerful relief than the most commonly prescribed painkillers			1
one high - profile practitioner of ' mindfulness ' meditation to reduce chronic pain is actress @entity26 this approach constitutes a new treatment based on the ancient practice of ' mindfulness ' meditation , which clinical trials show can reduce chronic pain by 57 per cent			1
accomplished meditators can reduce their pain by more than 90 per cent			1
one high - profile practitioner is actress @entity26			1
she has said that through mindfulness , ' we can move our set point of happiness '			1
she set up a programme called @entity41 under her @entity42 to help children deal with stress and emotions and reduce their anxiety			1
this forms the basis of her book 10 @entity49 , which teaches techniques such as mindful breathing and thinking			0
her faith in the procedure is backed up by science			0
brain imaging studies show that mindfulness not only soothes the brain patterns underlying pain but alters the structure of the brain itself , so patients no longer feel such intense pain			1
such is its effectiveness that pain clinics now prescribe mindfulness meditation to help patients with diseases such as cancer ( and chemotherapy side effects ) , heart disease , diabetes and arthritis , as well as other conditions such as migraine , coeliac disease and multiple sclerosis			1
pain comes in two forms , primary and secondary , each with very different causes			1
primary pain is the raw information sent by the body to the brain and arises from illness , injury or damage to the body			1
secondary pain is the mind 's reaction to primary pain and is often more intense and long - lasting			1
this type is controlled by an ' amplifier ' in the brain that governs the overall intensity of suffering			0
through mindfulness meditation you can learn to differentiate between the two - and turn off the latter			1
mindfulness soothes the brain patterns underlying pain , so patients no longer feel it so intensely we do not passively feel pain			1
the brain processes the information and teases apart the different sensations to try to find their underlying causes in order to avoid further damage to the body			0
in effect , the mind zooms in on pain looking for a solution			1
but this ' zooming - in ' amplifies pain			2
over time the brain fine - tunes itself to sense pain more quickly - and with greater intensity - in a futile attempt to avoid it			2
brain scans confirm that people with chronic pain have more tissue dedicated to feeling its sensations			1
mindfulness soothes the circuits that amplify secondary pain by dampening an area of the brain called the primary somatosensory cortex ( @entity140 ) , which contains a ' map ' of the human body in which nerve cells fire corresponding to pain in a region of your body			1
if you feel a lot of pain , this can be clearly seen in a brain scanner - it lights up like a christmas tree			2
the @entity140 's nerve firing is modulated by a great many other brain regions too , however , and they are affected by emotions , so anxiety or stress can prime the @entity140 and make it more sensitive to pain signals			2
@entity162 nvolves focusing on all the different parts of the body we call this ten - minute exercise @entity162 , as it involves focusing on all the different parts of the body , wherever your pain may be			2
do it twice a day in quiet surroundings			0
lie on your back on the floor , place your hands on your stomach			0
relax until it feels as if you are sinking into the floor focus on your breathing			0
is it deep or shallow , smooth or ragged ? feel the rhythm in as much detail as you can			0
does the breath ' echo ' in the pelvis ? the lower back ? how do you feel in these regions ? are they warm or cold ? do they ache ? move your awareness to your middle back , then the upper back , then the whole back			2
focus on your shoulders , neck , face , arms , hands			0
move your awareness through your legs , starting at your hips			2
if it aches too much , gently broaden your focus so you hold the discomfort in a wider space - such as your entire legs rather than your thigh			0
spend a couple of minutes observing the whole body breathing as one			0
gently open your eyes , and soak in the world around you			0
try to carry this awareness with you as you continue with your day			0
but if you are a meditator , with reduced stress and anxiety and better coping mechanisms , you get the initial pain spike but it fades to nothing very quickly - and this too can be seen on a brain scanner			2
i used mindfulness after a paragliding accident seven years ago , when i fell 30ft on to a rocky hillside and the lower half of my leg was driven several inches through my knee and into my thigh			2
through three major operations and two years of physiotherapy , i found it to be an extremely powerful painkiller and i 'm convinced it also accelerated my healing			0
over the next three weeks i 'll lead you through meditations from my new book			0
the programme was developed by my co-author @entity241 , a mindfulness expert who runs a @entity245 training centre and became a convert after two serious spinal injuries			2
the exercises are based on solid science as well as our own experience and have helped tens of thousands of people worldwide			0
