@entity0 fears he is being bugged at the @entity1			2
lawyers claim the @entity4 founder , who has been holed up in the embassy for the past two years to avoid extradition to @entity7 , ‘ is most likely under auditory surveillance ’			1
last year a covert listening device was found behind a plug socket in the ambassador ’s office , but security experts described it as rudimentary and unlikely to have been the work of police or the security services			0
among other reasons , they cite his cramped living conditions which mean he ‘ can not carry out his professional duties in a normal fashion ’			2
the 43 - year - old has lived at the embassy since @entity37 gave him asylum in 2012			1
the government wants to extradite him to @entity7 under a @entity41 where he faces questioning over allegations of sexual molestation and rape involving two women he met during a visit to the country in 2010			2
no charges have been brought because he has not been interrogated by police regarding allegations by the second of the two women			0
mr @entity0 says if he is sent to @entity7 he will be extradited to the @entity55 , where he could face 35 years in prison for publishing on @entity4 classified documents related to @entity55 activities in @entity59 and @entity60			1
@entity0 has been living in the @entity19 embassy , above , in @entity20 since 2012 , when the @entity62 decided to extradite him to @entity7 where he is wanted on charges of sexual assault police officers stationed outside the embassy round the clock – in an operation that has so far cost £ 7 million – are under orders to arrest him if he tries to leave			1
in the submission to the @entity71 on friday , his lawyers ask that text messages – which they believe suggest there was no basis for his arrest – be handed to the defence			0
they were sent by one of his accusers and @entity0 claims they show that she was ambiguous about his arrest and even opposed to it			0
his lawyers also argue that to ‘ break the deadlock ’ , he should be questioned at the embassy in @entity83 , rather than in @entity7			1
they note the @entity7 authorities have made no effort to arrange this			0
‘ residence in the embassy is , in other words , a result of the deprivation of liberty imposed on @entity0 by @entity7 , ’ says the claim his lawyers also point out that his embassy confinement is already nearly as long as the ‘ maximum sentence for the suspected crime ’			1
and they suggest that ‘ should he be forced to seek hospital care he will lose his political asylum and will be arrested ’			0
however , they do not mention the serious heart and lung conditions he is said to have developed since his incarceration .			0
