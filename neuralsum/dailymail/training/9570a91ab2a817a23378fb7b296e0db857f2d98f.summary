by @entity0 published : 06:11 est , 27 march 2012 updated : 09:05 est , 27 march 2012 in the horrific roll call of death and injury that emanates from @entity5 , it is sometimes easy to forget that each name , rank and number has its own unique story			1
that is what makes this image of a seriously wounded @entity14 soldier being treated in the heat of battle such an immediate snapshot of the random cruelty of war			1
but the story of private @entity21 also describes the true bravery of a man forced to rebuild his life after a devastating injury sustained on @entity26 last year			1
injured : private @entity21 lies in agony while being treated by medics , after the @entity30 explosion which saw him lose both his legs			1
now , for the first time , the soldier from @entity33 , @entity34 , has spoken about his ordeal and the very different battle he now faces for the rest of his life after losing both legs			1
recalling the day he stepped on the mine , @entity43 , who has given his permission for the photograph to be used , said : ‘ i was blown into the air , i felt the heat blast			1
‘ as i was coming back down it did n’t feel like i was falling , more like floating			1
that was until i hit the ground			1
’ the 25 - year - old , who regained consciousness in hospital on november 20 , added : ‘ before i woke up , i pretty much knew the legs were gone			1
i suppose i was conscious of the doctors talking			1
it still hit me when i woke up but not as badly as if i believed i was still all there			2
it was n’t a pretty sight			2
’ yet he has no regrets about joining the @entity62 , saying : ‘ i would n’t change anything			2
i chose the job , i chose to be with 3 @entity14			2
there was no second choice , it was always going to be them			2
’ line of fire : private @entity68 walks towards a doorway , left , in @entity71 just moments before the @entity73 explosion which saw him lose both his legs @entity43 was on patrol in @entity71 on november 11 with 3 @entity14 ( @entity77 ) , alongside soldiers from 1st @entity79			1
walking through open farmland that morning near @entity82 , they were part of a series of ops called @entity86 , aimed at disrupting insurgent activity in the area			2
second lieutenant @entity89 led his men on a mission to clear a series of compounds – and later said they all had a feeling of uneasiness about the situation			2
recovery : at @entity98 in @entity99 , private @entity68 is in rehabilitation and is learning walk with prosthetic limbs private @entity103 , 21 , was called forward to use his mine detector to sweep a hidden doorway leading to a compound			1
after deciding it was safe , he pushed on and swept the area beyond , followed by several others , who also came to no harm			2
then @entity43 , who had been providing rear protection , stepped through the doorway			0
lt @entity89 recalled : ‘ i was hit by a wave of sound and debris			0
it seemed to be moving in slow motion			0
i got launched a few metres and landed on my back			0
initially , i thought it was me that had stood on the device			0
‘ i gave myself a quick limb check and realised i was not in any pain apart from my face			0
for an instant , i thought maybe no - one was injured – but then thought that was silly because these things do n’t just go off			0
‘ i saw @entity68 lying just inside the doorway			0
one of his legs was missing , his hand was very swollen and he was missing the tip of one of his fingers , i saw the other leg was definitely damaged but it was still there at that point			1
i called for a medic and started giving initial first aid			0
’ the picture above tells the next part of the story , with lt @entity89 and the squad ’s medic , corporal @entity147 , 21 , saving @entity43 ’s life in those crucial first few minutes			0
tourniquets were applied , morphine and fluids were given and @entity43 was in hospital only 36 minutes after the explosion			0
lt @entity89 said : ‘ when i got up to @entity68 , i had never seen anything like it in my life			0
part of me thought , “ @entity159 , what am i going to do here ? ” but @entity147 did n’t appear to show any shock , he just treated it like an exercise			0
’ private @entity164 , 21 , cradled @entity43 ’s head and tried to keep him conscious and talking			1
he said : ‘ at one point , @entity68 tried to sit up and look at his legs			1
i held him down and told him he was going to be ok			0
’ doctors at the @entity169 military hospital in @entity99 have been much impressed by @entity68 ’s determination to recover as quickly as possible			0
‘ he ’s a very determined man , ’ said physiotherapist @entity171 , one of the team teaching him to walk on prosthetic limbs .			0
