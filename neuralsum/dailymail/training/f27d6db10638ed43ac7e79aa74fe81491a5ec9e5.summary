a team of researchers in @entity2 are trying to develop a ' pain switch ' in the human body to potentially eradicate the need for highly - addictive pain killers			1
researchers from @entity8 in @entity2 have spent three years looking at ways to turn off pain with a genetic switch that would be delivered up a person 's spine via a harmless virus			0
associate professor @entity15 has been leading the research and is now using genetic therapies using harmless viruses to test the pain switch theory on animals			1
associate professor @entity15 has been leading the research and is now using genetic therapies using harmless viruses to test the pain switch theory on animals the research was inspired by a @entity25 boy who used to walk on hot coals as he busked for money			1
scientists who were curious to find out how he could do it pain free found he had a rare genetic mutation , which means he lacked the gene that notified the brain of any pain			2
using that information , the team at @entity8 are trying to locate all of the nerve endings in a body that detect pain from various organs			0
' we know in humans that if you have an extremely rare mutation and lack this gene you do n't feel pain at all , ' prof @entity15 told the @entity47			2
the research was inspired by a @entity25 boy who used to walk on hot coals without pain as he busked for money			1
scientists found he had a rare genetic mutation that failed to notify the brain of any pain ' the virus takes a molecule to shut down the gene , it shuts down the channels for pain			1
' this is really exciting – we are not ready to move on to humans yet but it is very exciting			0
' the testing on animals has so far reduced pain by 75 percent from the gastrointestinal tract without affecting other organs in the body			0
' today if someone has severe pain they will probably be given an opioid like morphine that is very good at relieving pain but has a whole range of side effects , ' prof @entity15 said			0
' you can get sedated , addicted , build tolerance , suffer from withdrawal and constipation , you ca n't drive a vehicle or think straight – your whole body is affected – that 's the big problem			0

@entity15 , an associate professor at @entity8 , is researching ways to develop a pain switch
he is using generic therapies using harmless viruses to test on animals
prof @entity15 says the therapy would eradicate the need for highly - addictive pain killers like morphine
research was inspired by @entity25 boy who walked on hot coals without pain to busk for money
scientists found he had a rare genetic mutation that failed to *identify* the brain of any pain
