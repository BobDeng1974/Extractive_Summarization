by @entity0 published : 17:12 est , 5 june 2013 updated : 17:12 est , 5 june 2013 back to his roots : the @entity4 creator at @entity5 , close where he grew up @entity8 - @entity7 chef , musician and entrepreneur @entity6 is adamant that the key to turning rags into riches is having a mentor			1
and he should know , he ’s had a few – from the prison worker who convinced him to leave a life of crime behind , to @entity18 ’ den star @entity19 , who created a global brand from @entity6 ’s @entity4			1
now he ’s passing his advice on to schoolchildren on his nationwide @entity23 , which aims to get young people excited about cooking and making music , as well as motivating them to succeed			1
‘ i want to show them it does n’t matter what your background is – if you work hard and are determined you can be a success , ’ he says			2
back in 2007 , wearing his sharpest suit and his most infectious smile , @entity6 serenaded the stars of @entity18 ’ den with his @entity4 song			1
his performance secured him a £ 50,000 investment in return for 40 per cent of the business from @entity18 @entity19 and @entity41			1
almost immediately @entity42 ’s announced it would be stocking @entity6 ’s sauce in 600 of its stores , and within weeks it became its fastest - selling product			1
the @entity4 brand now has some 50 products , from table sauces to soft drinks , rocketing @entity6 to multi-millionaire status			1
‘ @entity19 saw beyond the sauce and was sold on my song , ’ laughs @entity6 , 54			2
‘ he ’s the most important mentor in my life			2
he made the crucial phone call that got the sauce into @entity42 ’s			1
' it was surreal going from selling the sauce on a market stall to seeing them on shelves all over the country			1
it was the most amazing thing that ’s happened to me			2
’ but it was a long slog			2
@entity6 had been selling the sauce himself from market stalls since 1991 while trying to make it as a musician , having been rejected for loans from banks for 16 years on the grounds that the sauce sounded ‘ too black ’			1
it was when he started to feel the pinch with his seven children that he realised he had to change tack			2
‘ the time came when i realised i was n’t making any money , so i decided to merge the music and food and give a bit of soul to the sauce			1
and i ’ve never looked back , thanks to @entity19			2
’ @entity19 was the one who warned @entity6 that success also brings trouble			2
on the show @entity6 claimed the secret recipe for his sauce was handed down by his grandmother @entity91			2
but his former business partner , chef @entity92 , accused @entity6 of stealing the recipe the pair used when they ran a stall at @entity96			1
' @entity19 saw beyond the sauce ' : @entity6 with his mentor @entity19 , who created a global brand from @entity6 's @entity4 @entity92 attempted to sue @entity6 for more than £ 600,000 , but @entity6 won the case in 2011 after the judge ruled he did n’t steal the recipe			1
@entity6 says he feels no cause to celebrate			0
‘ @entity19 always told me my story was too good to be true and to be prepared for someone to throw a spanner at me			0
but i never expected the spanner to be thrown from so close to home			0
’ @entity6 was born @entity6 in @entity7 , the youngest of six raised by his grandmother , as his elder siblings moved to the @entity8 , one by one , after his parents came to @entity8 to start a new life			0
‘ as they established themselves here they could afford to bring one child over each year			0
but as i was the youngest , i was the last to arrive			0
so my grandmother brought me up			0
' she was too poor to send me to school but she taught me to cook			1
we lived entirely off fresh fruit , herbs and spices from the garden and although there was no money , there were always good meals on the table			0
‘ @entity130 and music have always gone hand in hand for me			1
when i was playing , food was always there			0
i ’d be rustling up dishes in a pot and pan in the dressing room when we were on tour			0
’ ' we cooked outside all the time , ’ says @entity6 , whose latest book , grill it with @entity141 , is close to his heart as it concentrates on the @entity144 traditions of barbecuing and grilling			0
although in the court case @entity6 admitted it was a marketing ploy to claim the @entity4 sauce recipe was his grandmother ’s , he says , ‘ my grandmother taught me how to cook and one of the key things in @entity144 cooking is jerk chicken sauce			1
so i learnt how she did it and later perfected the recipe at home over many years			1
’ at the age of 12 , his parents sent for him to join them in @entity5 , south @entity159			0
‘ when i arrived i could n’t spell my own name			0
at school i just tried to be cool by showing everyone i could open a bottle of pop without a bottle opener , as i could n’t read or write			1
my mum took me to the library where i learnt to read from the @entity169 books			0
‘ but at home , the kitchen was my haven			0
@entity173 was busy working and my father worked nights as a rat catcher for the council , and as he went to work at 6pm , i ’d have to cook dinner for him : classic @entity144 dishes i ’d learnt from my grandmother , like goat curry , dumplings and soups			0
' @entity184 combines tips on how to succeed in business , a cookery lesson and a flavour of his music despite this homely life , @entity6 says he was drawn into a life of crime as he grew up in @entity5 in the 1970s while trying to carve out a career in music			1
special sauce : @entity6 's popular @entity196 has made him a multi-millionaire aged 15 he was sent to @entity198 for six months charged with assault on a police officer			1
in 1986 , police raided the youth club he ran and he was jailed again for possession of drugs			0
‘ in prison i met a woman who really inspired me			0
she taught prisoners how to get ready for the outside world and she said to me , “ you ’re not @entity6			0
@entity6 is bad and gets into trouble			0
” ' so as i lay in my prison cell bed i left behind @entity213 and became known by my rastafarian name , @entity6			0
’ deciding to stay on the right side of the law , @entity6 persevered with his music			1
he formed a band called @entity219 16 , performed with @entity220 and was nominated for a @entity221 in 1998			1
‘ @entity130 and music have always gone hand in hand for me			1
when i was playing , food was always there			0
i ’d be rustling up dishes in a pot and pan in the dressing room when we were on tour			0
’ @entity6 ’s ongoing @entity23 follows government proposals for compulsory cookery lessons for pupils aged seven to 14 to be introduced from 2014			2
‘ if you can combine your two passions you have the best job in the world			2
that ’s what i tell all the pupils i see , ’ says @entity6 , whose tailor - made school visits include a flavour of his music , some tips on how to succeed in business and a cookery lesson			1
‘ too many youngsters see cooking as dull or laborious , which is just not true			0
and i tell them everyone needs a mentor			0
i ’ve been in business for five years now and the @entity4 products have sold millions – but i still have a mentor in @entity19			1
