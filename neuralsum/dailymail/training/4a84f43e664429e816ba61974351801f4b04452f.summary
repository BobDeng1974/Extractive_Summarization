night shift employees often need to find creative ways of filling their time			0
but workers at a @entity5 supermarket have certainly found one of the most creative ways of filling their time while they were meant to be filling shelves			0
arranging pallets and products into a behemoth domino chain , viewers are taken on a tour through the store by way of the domino effect			0
filmed by @entity17 , the chain begins outside the @entity19 store of @entity22 supermarket chain @entity20			1
a worker pushes the first wooden pallet , at the automatic door entrance of a @entity27 shopping centre - kicking off the impressive domino chain that diverges and meets again after going around a tree			2
@entity31 ' em up : the domino chain started with wooden pallets that led to the @entity35 supermarket 's entrance up and away : the products ranged in size and shape as the domino chain reaches the supermarket aisles , the dominos become the products that customers would find in each aisle if they were shopping there			2
from dvds and cds to tetra - paks of juice and tissue boxes , nothing is off limits in the massive domino effect of supermarket products			1
aisle be watching ! the impressive domino chain went from aisle to aisle everything but the kitchen sink : as the domino chain made it 's way through the aisles , the different products available to shoppers were showcased eventually , the chain ends at the checkout and a young female employee is seen holding a sign , that translates in @entity68 to ‘ thank you for your visit ’			1
some viewers of the video have branded it a marketing stunt , but either way - it will no doubt serve as inspiration for bored supermarket workers everywhere .			0
