millions of drivers have been warned about higher fuel costs and even engine damage if they use a new ‘ green ’ petrol			1
@entity4 has signed up to an @entity6 directive which says suppliers must dilute petrol with environmentally - friendly alternatives such as ethanol made from corn			1
the new petrol is called @entity13 and is 10 per cent ethanol			1
it is due to be launched in the @entity4 later this year , alongside standard petrol and other green fuels			1
paying extra at the pump : the new biofuel gives fewer miles to the gallon however , a study today warns @entity13 gives fewer miles to the gallon , so a typical family will pay around £ 80 a year extra to travel the same distance			1
there are also fears that the high ethanol content can effectively melt components of some engines in older cars and motorbikes			0
up to 8.6million vehicles may not be compatible with @entity13 fuel , according to estimates by the @entity35			1
its arrival on forecourts will be confusing for drivers unless pumps are clearly labelled and they know whether it is safe for their car			0
possible inclusion in the budget : @entity46 has hinted at a cut or freeze in fuel duty to help drivers struggling with his prices the move to @entity13 is part of a wider policy to cut the use of fossil fuels and so reduce their contribution to the creation of greenhouse gases and global warming			1
a study by respected think - tank @entity63 warns : ‘ the increased use of ethanol in petrol to meet @entity6 sustainability targets is resulting in drivers paying extra at the pump			1
’ the @entity6 ’s @entity70 requires 5 per cent of the fuel supply of member states to be renewable by 2014			0
this is due to increase in the next seven years under the @entity6 ’s @entity74 , which requires 10 per cent of transport energy from renewable sources by 2020			0
oil companies have decided to use ethanol as this renewable source			0
most comes from the @entity80 , where it is made from corn , while some comes from @entity85 ’s sugar cane and a small amount from @entity4 sugar beet			2
however , using petrol diluted with ethanol generally cuts a vehicle ’s fuel efficiency			2
the report calculates that if the @entity6 policy of supplying 10 per cent of transport energy from renewable sources had been applied in the @entity4 in 2011 - 12 , it would have cost motorists some £ 1.5billion , or around £ 80 a year more per family			1
biofuel : a fuel nozzle serving @entity13 at a petrol station in @entity101 author @entity102 , a senior research fellow at @entity63 , warned @entity13 petrol is not compatible with millions of older vehicles			1
‘ based on case studies in other countries that have introduced @entity13 , field trials and laboratory tests , the research found issues of material incompatibility , corrosion and drivability problems for vehicles of ten years or older , ’ he said			2
@entity13 was introduced in @entity115 two years ago			2
many drivers have decided not to use it in case it damages their engines			0
‘ @entity115 motorists are also thought to be suspicious of the wider environmental and social impacts of ethanol , ’ said mr @entity102			0
the government has asked suppliers to delay introducing @entity13 to allow time for an information campaign and to compile a list of incompatible vehicles for drivers			2
mr @entity102 , a former top official with @entity131 , added that taking farmland out of food production to grow fuel crops also threatens to put up food prices			0
he said : ‘ biofuels increase the level and volatility of food prices , generating social impacts in low income food importing countries			0
’ the study was funded by @entity144 , a business which collects and refines waste cooking oil to be used as biodiesel in vehicles			0
mr @entity102 and @entity144 argue this is a better option than ethanol .			0

@entity13 means a typical family will pay around £ 80 a year extra for petrol
the fuel is due to be launched in the @entity4 later this year
@entity46 has hinted there may be a freeze in fuel duty in the budget
