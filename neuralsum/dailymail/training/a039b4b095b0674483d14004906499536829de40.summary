if you 're out at the beach this weekend - like most @entity2 hope they will be - it might be an idea to look up			0
about 5,000 feet up , actually			0
that 's about where @entity8 photographer @entity7 will be making his works of art. the self - taught snapper initially started out taking pictures of kiteboarders as head photographer of the @entity16 , according to @entity17			1
then , while covering finals in @entity20 and @entity21 , @entity18 turned his lens from the water to the beach - and that 's where the magic happened			2
think this is a painting ? it 's not : aerial photographer @entity7 takes pictures of crowded packed beaches from 5,000 feet in the air cartoonish : @entity18 claims that , save some basic touch ups , his photos are not edited or choreographed the idea came to rose during a trip to @entity20 and @entity21 , where he was covering the @entity16 as head photographer the series of photos has been titled ' @entity43 ' and is years in the making most of @entity18 's most recent work was shot in the @entity47 intricate : the photos come off as landscape - type paintings not your average occupation : a great deal of safety is required for the work @entity18 does while the resultant photos appear heavily edited - almost cartoon - like - @entity18 said he does not do anything to his shots , save a few minor touch ups on @entity60			1
also he does have anything to do with how the umbrellas , chairs or people are placed - that 's just natural , he says			0
most of his more recent pieces have been taken in @entity47 and @entity68 , both of which are known for their colorful umbrellas and swimwear fashions			1
however , while the pictures are pretty and celebratory , there are many dangers to the work @entity18 does			2
dangling out of a helicopter in order to get the shots takes many safety measures			2
additionally , @entity18 told @entity17 he once had a close call with an @entity84 plane			0
the heights he travels to in order to capture the right photos is alot higher than routes helicopters typically take , and takes proper precaution from the pilot			0
@entity18 's photographs can be found in prestigious private and corporate collections some of the pieces are part of the permanent collection of the @entity97 in @entity98 puzzling : the effect of the photos almost makes the people and objects on the ground look like puzzle pieces @entity18 also says that his work is part anthropological , because it documents certain human behaviors , such as the way people gather from above , the crowds that gather on the beaches of @entity98 and @entity68 take on geometries that make each beachgoer 's place in the sand seem almost methodical for more information , visit @entity119			1

@entity8 photographer @entity7 has *spent* the last few years taking photos of the beaches of @entity68 and @entity123
he is *suspended* out of a helicopter on a *harness* as he takes the shots
his pieces look like cartoons or landscape paintings
however @entity18 says he does edit the pictures beyond some *simple* touch ups
