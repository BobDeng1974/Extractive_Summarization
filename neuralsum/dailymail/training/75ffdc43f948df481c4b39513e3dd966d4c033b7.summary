by @entity1 reporter @entity2 : 08:42 est , 24 december 2013 @entity3 : 14:50 est , 24 december 2013 astronauts have wrapped up urgent space station repairs during a rare @entity7 spacewalk , braving a ' mini blizzard ' of noxious ammonia as they popped in a new pump			1
it was the second spacewalk in four days for @entity13 astronauts @entity14 and @entity15 , and only the second @entity7 spacewalk in @entity18 history			1
@entity18 ordered up the spacewalks to revive a critical cooling loop at the @entity21			1
with today 's success , the cooling system should be restored and all equipment back up and running by this weekend , according to @entity18			1
@entity14 and @entity15 removed the faulty ammonia pump during saturday 's outing			1
on christmas eve , they installed the fresh pump			0
standing on the end of the station 's main robotic arm , @entity15 clutched the 780 - pound , refrigerator - size pump with both hands as he headed toward its installation spot , and then slid it in			2
an astronaut working inside , @entity53 's @entity52 , gingerly steered the arm and its precious load			0
' @entity30 taking a special sleigh ride on this @entity7 , ' @entity57 commentator @entity56 said as the space station soared over the @entity60			2
it was slow going because of a balky ammonia fluid line that sent frozen flakes of the extremely toxic substance straight at the men - ' a mini blizzard , ' as @entity57 called it			0
the spacewalkers reported being surrounded by big chunks of the stuff that bounced off equipment and , in all probability , their suits			2
the ammonia needed to dissipate from their suits before the pair returned inside , to avoid further contamination			0
flying high : ' it 's like @entity7 morning opening up a little present here , ' astronaut @entity14 ( top ) said as he checked his toolkit zero gravity : astronaut @entity30 lies against the robotic arm during a spacewalk outside the @entity21 ' wow , ' @entity15 sighed after the fourth and final fluid line was hooked to the new pump			1
the electrical hookups went more smoothly , and six hours into the spacewalk , @entity15 finally called down , ' @entity90 , you 've got yourself a new pump module '			1
@entity7 references filled the radio waves , as the action unfolded 260 miles above the planet			2
' it 's like @entity7 morning opening up a little present here , ' @entity14 said as he checked his toolkit			1
later , as he worked to remove the spare pump from its storage shelf , he commented : ' now it really feels like i 'm unwrapping a present			0
' @entity57 in @entity90 was in a festive mood , despite the gravity of the situation			0
tabletop @entity7 trees , @entity108 dolls and red @entity108 caps decorated the desks			2
@entity18 's only previous @entity7 spacewalk occurred in 1999 during a @entity113 repair mission			1
but @entity18 's most memorable @entity7 was back on december 24 , 1968			1
@entity115 8 astronauts read from @entity116 , the first book of the @entity118 , as they orbited the moon on mankind 's first lunar flight			0
lost in space : the @entity7 venture was the second spacewalk in four days for @entity13 astronauts @entity14 and @entity15 a bad valve in the ammonia pump caused the latest breakdown			1
another team of spacewalking astronauts installed that pump just three years ago , and engineers are perplexed as to why it did n't last longer			0
@entity18 hopes to salvage it in the years ahead			2
the 2010 replacement required three spacewalks because of the difficulty in removing pressurized ammonia fluid lines			0
but this time , the astronauts managed to squeeze everything into two after @entity18 reduced the pressure and simplified the task			2
@entity57 planned to wait until tuesday evening before fully activating the new pump , but initial testing showed everything working well			0
the two - line cooling system uses ammonia to dispel heat generated by on - board equipment ; only one loop was disabled by the breakdown			1
busy : @entity18 astronaut @entity15 work to repair an external cooling line on the @entity21 on a spacewalk 260 miles above @entity154 on saturday the second spacewalk was supposed to take place on monday , but it was delayed a day to give @entity14 time to switch to another suit			1
he inadvertently hit a water switch in the air lock at the end of saturday 's excursion , and a bit of water encroached on a cooling device in the backpack of his suit , making it unusable			0
otherwise , the suits remained dry during both spacewalks			0
last july , an astronaut almost drowned when water from his suit 's cooling system flooded his helmet			1
makeshift snorkels and absorbent pads were added to the suits as a precaution			0
a @entity180 - led spacewalk , meanwhile , is set for friday			0
two @entity183 crew members will install new cameras and fresh experiments outside .			0

@entity18 astronauts @entity14 and @entity15 ventured out of the @entity21 to repair a cooling system on december 24
it was the second @entity7 spacewalk in @entity18 history , the first was in 1999
@entity18 says all equipment should be up and running by the weekend
