@entity0 saw the emergence of wearable technology on runways such as @entity4 who debuted their smart @entity7 bracelet			0
however for @entity8 creating a futuristic vibe on the runway involves a little less technology and a little more tinsel			2
for their @entity14 collection showcased last night @entity15 on @entity17 's @entity16 , the @entity19 design duo , @entity20 and @entity21 created a ' space safari ' with a collection that the designer 's are calling ' luna chic			1
' @entity8 's @entity14 collection saw a collaboration with @entity28 bringing high end to the high street including mother of pearl pieces like the necklace pictured an array of silver ' tinsel ' dresses , white suits and metallic sequins gave a nod to the @entity42 scene that would n't look out of place in the @entity44			1
the palette conveyed the brand 's notion of space age perfectly made - up entirely of silver and white in what the pair hope will be an uplifting collection that looks forward rather than back			1
this collection sees the brand 's high - end design meet high - street affordability as @entity8 collaborates with accessories brand @entity28 for their @entity14 jewellery range			1
despite the affordability the pieces look anything other than cheap , with the statement necklaces dripping with mother of pearl and shell			1
the collection took a futuristic feel and was entitiled @entity67 and the palette was made up purely of white and silver @entity71 is a big fan of the @entity19 brand and attended last night 's show at @entity15 for @entity20 , the collaboration means welcoming those who are so often excluded from the fashion industry			1
' a lot of 16 - year - old girls are fans of our brand and they aspire to it especially when they see celebs like @entity84 wearing our pieces			2
but the sad fact is they just ca n't afford it			0
' however , this season could see that change with the intricate yet affordable pieces being readily available to the public			0
' the jewellery will available to buy online ' says @entity21 ' we wanted to bring high - end to the high - street			1
' given the futuristic nature of the collection it would seem that adding wearable technology to the range would have made perfect sense but for @entity20 , technology in fashion should involve changes in material rather than megabits			2
the models channeled a new trend of glittery centre partings , fitting for the futuristic theme ' i think that if there is a suggestion of technology such as new textures in fabric but if there is technology there just for the sake of it and the design is ugly then it is pointless			0
' as if a clothing collection were n't enough @entity8 also has it 's own music label 1234 and for their @entity14 show they enlisted one of their own djs to create the sound track to the catwalk			1
' we always want to create something new and fresh when it comes to music ' says @entity21 and @entity20 agrees			0
' yes and whatever it is it is always really close to home , ' the pair claim that their @entity14 collection is very wearable despite the heavy metallic and suggest that it has a resort feel			2
the designers are determined to increase @entity145 wearability further as they announce plans for a further high street collaboration with online fashion brand @entity148			0
for @entity21 this collaboration is all about bringing down the exclusive nature of the fashion industry whilst maintaining quality			0
' we want to be able to share our designs but on an affordable level ' he says adding ' it 's all about creating accessible elitism			0
' friendly frow : from left to right ex made in @entity163 star @entity165 , actress and model @entity168 , and actor and model @entity164			0
