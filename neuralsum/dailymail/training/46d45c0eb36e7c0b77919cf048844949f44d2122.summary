by @entity0 last updated at 3:44 pm on 10th february 2012 an incredible insight into how a major earthquake changed the landscape – down to a few inches – has been made possible thanks to cutting edge @entity7 scanning technology			1
it stands for ' light detection and ranging ' and involves bouncing a stream of laser pulses off the ground , which gives scientists an incredibly detailed image of the landscape			1
luckily for a team of @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity22 geologists , a lidar scan had already been made of an area in @entity20 hit by an earthquake , giving them the opportunity to create the most comprehensive ‘ before and after ’ image of such a disaster zone ever created			1
@entity20 earthquake @entity7 : @entity29 shows where ground surface moved down , red shows upward movement compared to the previous survey how the aftermath looked on the ground : a crack right across a road near @entity38 following the huge earthquake ‘ we can learn so much about how earthquakes work by studying fresh fault ruptures , ’ said @entity40 , geology professor at the @entity42 , and lead researcher			1
the team , working with the @entity48 , flew over an area near @entity38 , northern @entity20 , that was hit by a magnitude 7.2 event in april 2010 and scanned it with @entity7			1
the researchers were able to make a detailed scan over about 140 square miles in less than three days , @entity40 said			1
@entity40 said that they knew the area had been mapped with @entity7 in 2006 by the @entity20 government			1
powerful : the quake collapsed a church in @entity38 when the earthquake occurred , @entity40 and @entity60 at @entity61 applied for and got funding from the @entity64 to carry out an immediate aerial survey to compare the results			1
but the @entity7 survey further reveals warping of the ground surface adjacent to faults that previously could not easily be detected , @entity40 said			2
for example , it revealed the folding above the @entity74 fault running beneath agricultural fields in the floodplain of the @entity77			2
‘ this would be very hard to see in the field , ’ @entity40 said			2
team members used the ‘ virtual reality ’ facility at @entity42 's @entity83 in @entity84 to handle and view the data from the survey			2
by comparing pre- and post-earthquake surveys , they could see exactly where the ground moved and by how much			0
the survey revealed deformation around the system of small faults that caused the earthquake , and allowed measurements that provide clues to understanding how these multi-fault earthquakes occur			0
the 2010 @entity38 earthquake did not occur on a major fault , like the @entity100 , but ran through a series of smaller faults in the @entity104 's crust			0
these minor faults are common around major faults but are ‘ underappreciated , ’ @entity40 said			0
‘ this sort of earthquake happens out of the blue , ’ he said			0
the new @entity7 survey shows how seven of these small faults came together to cause a major earthquake , @entity40 said			1
@entity113 , a geophysicist with the @entity114 and coauthor on the paper , made the first use of airborne @entity7 about 10 years ago to document surface faulting from the @entity120 earthquake			0
ready and waiting : a lidar ' trap ' has been set for the @entity100 , which produced an earthquake in 1906 that reduced large parts of @entity125 to rubble but ‘ pre-earthquake ’ data were lacking			0
since then , @entity48 has carried out @entity7 scans of the @entity100 system and other active faults in the western @entity19 , thereby setting a trap for future earthquakes , he said			0
‘ in this case , fortunately , our cicese colleagues had set such a trap , and this earthquake fell right into it and became the first ever to be imaged by ‘ before ’ and ‘ after ' ‘ @entity7			0
it is a thrill for me to be on the team that reached this important milestone , ’ @entity113 said .			0
