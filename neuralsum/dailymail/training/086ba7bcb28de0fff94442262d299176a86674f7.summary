@entity2 , the chairman of the @entity12 , warned that government support for merging @entity3 with @entity4 - @entity5 aviation firm @entity14 will undermine @entity10 ’s status as a ‘ major military power ’ and waste taxpayers ’ money			1
the former shadow defence secretary warned that giving the @entity4 and @entity5 governments , who own parts of @entity14 , access to our military secrets would undermine the @entity10 ’s vital intelligence sharing with the @entity27			1
and he said it would also undermine @entity10 ’s ability to build submarines and make urgent changes to equipment in situations of national peril like the @entity35			1
in an article for the @entity37 , mr @entity2 said if the company must be sold off it should join forces with an @entity27 firm instead			1
‘ the question of ownership with respect to @entity3 ’s key @entity10 assets is about whom the @entity10 can trust , and to which country ’s influence the @entity10 should choose to submit , ’ he writes			2
concerns : mr @entity2 warned that foreign ownership of @entity3 would make it more difficult to hold the company to account for procurement delays and overruns ‘ a @entity27 takeover of @entity3 would be better : for @entity10 security , for access to technology ; and for economic resilience			1
‘ better still , the @entity10 should retain ownership of its defence supply chain , not only as the best guarantee that our @entity62 will have what they need in a crisis , but so our defence industries can be atlanticist and @entity67			2
it might not suit the shareholders , but it is in our national interest			0
’ and mr @entity2 also took aim at cabinet secretary sir @entity71 , who has encouraged @entity72 to back the deal on commercial grounds			1
sir @entity71 previously worked at @entity76 , the merchant bank which is advising @entity3 in the deal			0
mr @entity2 questioned whether sir @entity71 might seek to return to the bank			2
‘ who knows where sir @entity71 may work when he retires ? ’ he asked			0
‘ is this a potential conflict of interest ? ’ the @entity82 insists sir @entity71 has behaved properly and it is his job to be involved in government discussion of the deal			0
positive : @entity72 , pictured yesterday in @entity87 , is backing the deal but has sought reassurances about national security and the relationship with the @entity27 @entity72 is backing the @entity3 deal but has sought reassurances about national security and the relationship with the @entity27			2
but mr @entity2 argued that @entity27 spy chiefs will be concerned that @entity3 ’s relationship with the @entity95 listening post in @entity96 , which works closely with the @entity97 in the @entity27 , could undermine signals intelligence			1
' a @entity27 takeover of @entity3 would be better : for @entity10 security , for access to technology ; and for economic resilience ' @entity105 chairman ‘ @entity3 supports operations at @entity95 through its security subsidiary , @entity107			1
how would the @entity27 feel if the @entity14 equivalent , @entity109 , gained access to @entity107 ’s intellectual property and even to sensitive intelligence itself ? ’ mr @entity2 writes			1
‘ anyone who says this is “ @entity119 ” simply betrays their own @entity116 , @entity115 prejudice			0
mr @entity2 warns that the newly merged company , which will be at least 60 per cent controlled by @entity14 , could shut down key defence installations in the @entity10			1
‘ @entity3 ’s @entity123 nuclear - powered submarines , built in @entity124 , are possibly the best in the world			0
@entity124 is due to build the next generation of @entity129 submarines , on which the future of @entity10 ’s nuclear deterrent depends			2
‘ no assurance could guarantee that @entity14 will sustain nuclear submarine design and construction in both the @entity10 and @entity4			2
’ fears : mr @entity2 argues that selling off @entity3 would rob @entity10 of ' on shore capability ' - the ability to adapt defence equipment at home in times of crisis mr @entity2 said undermining submarine capability would also undercut the special relationship			1
‘ submarines underline our closeness with the @entity27			0
@entity10 subs use @entity27 facilities for battle - gaming and training			1
our sub crews ’ readiness is certified by the @entity153 , and the @entity154 certifies theirs			0
' no assurance could guarantee that @entity14 will sustain nuclear submarine design and construction in both the @entity10 and @entity4 ' @entity105 chairman ‘ neither @entity4 nor @entity5 is trusted by the @entity27 , as they trust us			2
@entity4 - @entity5 ownership of @entity124 would be bound to change the atmosphere of co-operation			0
’ mr @entity2 argues that selling off @entity3 would rob @entity10 of ‘ on shore capability ’ - the ability to adapt defence equipment at home in times of crisis			1
‘ we could not have recovered the @entity168 in 1982 without on - shore capability			0
@entity170 and @entity171 converted a roll - on / roll - off ferry into a helicopter platform and hospital ship in a matter of weeks , ’ he explained			0
‘ @entity176 were fitted with air - to - air refuelling in a matter of days			0
lack of on - shore capability can leave us hostage to foreign interests			0
’ he also warned that foreign ownership of @entity3 would make it more difficult to hold the company to account for procurement delays and overruns that have cost the taxpayer billions in the past			0
‘ a foreign - owned @entity3 will be even harder to shame for its failures , ’ he said .			0
