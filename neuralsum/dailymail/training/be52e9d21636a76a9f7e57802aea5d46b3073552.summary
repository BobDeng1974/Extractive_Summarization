@entity0 , @entity1 , @entity2 : all names of celebrities who have thrown a ceremonial first pitch at an @entity8 baseball game			1
none , though , have been as strange as @entity11 's appearance last friday			2
as is traditional at baseball games in the @entity8 , a special guest threw the first pitch at the @entity15 v @entity17 game on september 5 , but it is rare to see a pitcher provoke as much fear in the opposition as this			1
the @entity24 character , once voted the third greatest movie villain of all - time , was flanked by two costumed storm troopers as he stepped up to the mound to pitch the first ball at @entity29 in @entity30 , @entity31			0
it is unclear whether the moustachioed receiver , pictured below , was harmed by the throw , but both participants are clearly seen shaking hands in the aftermath of the incident			0
@entity11 is not the first celebrity to throw a disappointing first pitch			0
this comes after @entity1 's disastrous attempt at a @entity59 game was labelled the ' worst first pitch ever ' by onlookers			0
video see below to watch @entity1 's awful first pitch for the @entity59 incoming : the receiver did not look affected as the ball ' hurtled ' towards him helpers : @entity11 was flanked by storm troopers as he approached the mound friends : the two opponents shook hands after the pitch , and it appears nobody was harmed			1
