a new @entity1 treatment pioneered using an antibody to attack the virus could lead to a new vaccine to prevent the infection			1
the first results to emerge from patient trials reveal the experimental therapy can dramatically reduce the level of virus in a patient 's blood - their viral load			1
the scientists behind the discovery believe their findings offer new strategies for fighting or even preventing hiv infection			0
the antibody was designed by researchers to block the key viral protein receptor that is needed to infect human blood cells			1
as a result patients injected with the neutralising antibody during the trials saw a 300-fold reduction in their viral load			1
scientists at the @entity29 in @entity30 believe a new antibody therapy could pave the way for an hiv vaccine after clinical trials revealed the treatment resulted in a 300-fold decrease in the amount of @entity1 , pictured , in sufferers ' blood in a person infected with @entity1 , there is an ongoing battle between the virus and the body 's immune system			1
as the body produces new antibodies that target the virus , the infection mutates to escape , managing to stay a few steps ahead			0
the team of scientists at @entity29 in @entity30 now believe that using synthetic antibodies that attached to the surface of proteins on the outer membrane of the hiv virus , could offer an alternative treatment to the anti-retroviral drugs currently used			1
they hope the breakthrough will result in new therapeutic vaccines			1
@entity1 antibodies previously tested in humans had shown disappointing results , but the antibody tested at @entity29 belongs to a new generation of broadly neutralising antibodies that potently fight a wide range of @entity1 strains			1
healthy gay men should be given anti-retroviral drugs to ' slash the number of cases of @entity1 ' , a groundbreaking study published earlier this year suggested			1
the @entity75 study , conducted in @entity76 , provides the first evidence that preventative @entity1 treatment is highly effective in a real - world setting			2
it showed that pre-exposure to the @entity1 drug @entity83 can reduce the risk of infection in men - who - have - sex - with - men by as much as 86 per cent			2
previous research had suggested that preventive treatment might cut hiv infection rates but it was unclear whether such an approach would work in practice			0
' one antibody alone , like one drug alone , will not be sufficient to suppress viral load for a long time because resistance will arise , ' said dr @entity98 , co-first author of the study			0
' what 's special about these antibodies is that they have activity against over 80 per cent of @entity1 strains and they are extremely potent			2
' the research showed the new antibody therapy was effective against 195 of 237 @entity1 strains			1
the immune systems of people infected with @entity1 naturally produce broadly neutralising antibodies in 10 to 30 per cent of sufferers , but only after several years of infection			2
by that time , the virus has typically evolved and mutated to a point rendering the powerful antibodies ineffective			0
however , by isolating and cloning these antibodies , researchers are able to harness them as therapeutic agents to use against @entity1 infections that have had less time to evolve			2
as part of the new study , uninfected and @entity1 - infected people were given a single dose of the antibody intravenously , and monitored for 56 days			1
at the highest dose level - 30mg per kilo of weight - all eight infected people treated showed up to a 300-fold decrease in the amount of hiv virus measured in their blood			1
most of those participants reached their lowest viral load just one week after treatment			0
the study marks the first time the new generation of @entity1 antibodies has been tested in humans			2
dr @entity98 , co-first author of the study , said : ' what 's special about these antibodies is that they have activity against over 80 per cent of @entity1 strains and they are extremely potent			0
' ( @entity151 picture ) dr @entity98 said further trials could result in the antibodies being used in conjunction with existing anti-retroviral drugs to maintain better control over the infection to prevent the onset of @entity160			0
she said antibody therapy might require treatment once every few months , compared with daily doses of antiretroviral drugs , currently the front line treatment for the virus			0
besides the possibility of treatment , the study also raises hopes for an hiv vaccine			0
dr @entity98 said that if researchers can induce an uninfected person 's immune system to generate potent antibodies such as that tested , it might be enough to block the hiv infection before it can be established			0
the study was published in the journal @entity181 .			0

new antibody blocks protein receptor needed to infect human cells
patients injected saw 300-fold reduction in amount of @entity1 in their blood
scientists believe breakthrough could result in new vaccines against virus
