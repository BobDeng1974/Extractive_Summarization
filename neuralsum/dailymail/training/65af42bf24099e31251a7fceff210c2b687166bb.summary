@entity0 takes a look at 10 things we have learned from an entertaining weekend of @entity5 fixtures , as well as intriguing statistics from the @entity7			1
@entity8 are n’t afraid to leave a foot in during big games – no side this weekend committed more fouls than the 15 that @entity8 were penalised for in the @entity14 derby			2
this season @entity16 ’s team have given away 16 fouls against @entity18 and 15 at @entity19 – but only six each in the matches when they were cruising to victory against @entity22 and @entity23			2
@entity8 captain @entity24 puts in a crunching challenge on @entity26 2			2
local lad @entity27 is emerging as @entity29 ’s key midfield man ahead of players who cost the club millions			1
the 23 - year - old , who made his @entity29 debut six years ago but then seemed to spend his life on loan , has started the last five @entity5 games and was a big influence in the win at @entity22			1
his part in @entity41 ’s dismissal grabbed the headlines , but on the ball he was excellent – across the @entity5 weekend only @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 played more accurate attacking passes than his 45			2
@entity27 has been given a new lease of life by @entity50 at @entity29 3			1
@entity52 ’s work rate , so terrific beating @entity8 , dropped as they went two goals down at @entity55 before a @entity56 inspired recovery earned a point			2
@entity59 had talked about the need to maintain the competitive attitude , but the message obviously did n’t entirely get through			2
when @entity59 checks his stats he ’ll find his team ran a collective two miles less at the @entity65 than they managed at @entity66 a week earlier – and the number of sprints dropped by 6.4 per cent from 533 to 499			1
@entity56 has been one of @entity52 's star performers this season @entity70 's @entity52 came back from 2 - 0 to salvage a point on saturday against @entity55 4			1
@entity72 is making a nonsense of the modern theory that players ca n’t perform at high intensity in two games a week			1
the @entity79 boss made just two changes at @entity23 from the side that had won 3 - 2 at @entity55 in the @entity82			1
he also kept nine of his starting line - up to beat @entity85 after winning at @entity19 in the last round of the competition , and picked eight of the players who knocked @entity90 out in round one for the 3 - 1 win at @entity52 a few days later			1
@entity72 has had a brilliant start to life as manager of @entity79 5			1
@entity96 was supposed to be the hard man who would beef up @entity99 ’s defence but so far has failed to make the big difference @entity101 was hoping for			1
after losing at @entity103 the @entity102 have conceded two more goals than they did in the first ten games last season			2
@entity107 highlighted how 25 - year - old @entity109 international @entity108 pulled out of a crucial 50 - 50 challenge late in the game			2
he won only two tackles in the 90 minutes , and this season has come out on top in just 72 per cent of his tackles , compared to 82.6 per cent when he was at @entity79 last season			1
@entity96 has flattered to deceive since signing for @entity99 from @entity79 for £ 20million 6			1
@entity118 goalkeeper @entity117 played for @entity119 at every age group from under 16 to under 21 during his days as a @entity122 player			1
now aged 28 , playing behind a team that ’s getting battered in the @entity5 is giving him a chance to remind everybody of the potential he once showed			0
@entity117 made eight saves at @entity19 – more than any other keeper during saturday ’s games – although he still found himself picking the ball out of the net three times			0
@entity117 was in inspired form for struggling @entity118 at @entity19 on saturday 7			0
@entity135 ’s @entity134 , the younger brother of @entity122 defender @entity136 , is starting to have a severe problem with his discipline			0
the 24 - year - old @entity140 international midfielder picked up his seventh booking of the season in the 3 - 1 win over @entity144			0
that ’s already three more yellow cards than he was shown in the whole of last season			0
@entity151 manager @entity150 needs to do something to stop his team throwing away points in games they have been leading			0
the @entity157 dominated at @entity158 with former @entity160 star @entity159 starring but conceded an equaliser with 20 minutes left			0
it ’s the fourth time they ’ve failed to see out a game from a winning position this season – and the eight points lost would have been enough to put @entity150 ’s side second in the table			0
@entity151 manager @entity150 looks on frustrated during the @entity157 defeat to @entity158 9			0
most managers like to pick one goalkeeper and stick with him , but @entity174 ’s @entity173 turned to his fourth of the season to fight for the 0 - 0 draw at @entity178 which gave him hope of getting out of the @entity181 relegation zone			0
@entity183 ’s arrival on loan from @entity22 – together with the influence of 20 - year - old @entity187 defender @entity186 – kept the division ’s top scorer @entity188 at bay			0
@entity173 , 59 and a legend at @entity192 after leading the club into the @entity7 in his first spell in charge , and then to the @entity196 in his second , had previously used and discarded @entity198 , @entity199 and @entity200			0
@entity173 has tinkered around with the no 1 goalkeeper slot at @entity174 this season 10			0
@entity203 manager @entity202 could do with bottling some of the spirit his side show at @entity206 and taking it with him on the road			0
the 3 - 0 romp over @entity210 in front of more than 15,000 fans put his side two points off the play - off places and means they have lost only once in front of their home crowd this season			1
but that ’s in stark contrast to the away record – since winning at @entity223 at the end of august they have picked up just two points on their travels from six matches			0
@entity202 's @entity203 side have impressed at home but not so much on the road this season			1

@entity72 has proved with the *success* he has *achieved* at @entity79 that players can play at high intensity twice a week
@entity99 's £ 20m man @entity96 continues to flatter to deceive
@entity27 could become a key player for @entity29
