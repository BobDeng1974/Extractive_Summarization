the scottish independence referendum is still a week away - but one airport appears to regard it as a foregone conclusion			0
a @entity5 traveller was shocked to be offered the ' @entity7 pound ' at a bureau de change in @entity9 yesterday , apparently in anticipation of @entity7 setting up its own currency			1
the tourist joked : ' it seems that some people have already decided the outcome of the independence vote			0
it was offered at an exchange rate of 5.75 @entity28 dirhams to the pound - the same rate as the real pound			0
@entity32 , an @entity34 documentary maker , saw the bizarre mistake as he was travelling to @entity36			0
' the @entity5 pound was at the top and @entity7 pound was as a separate currency , ' he said			1
' it seems that some people have already decided the outcome of the independence vote			0
' debate : the currency to be used in an independent @entity7 has been the subject of fierce disagreement the ' pound @entity7 ' was @entity7 's currency during the @entity50 , but was abolished at the time of the @entity52 with @entity34 in 1707			1
although @entity7 banks print pound banknotes , they are not a separate currency and are accepted in the rest of @entity5			2
the future of the pound in @entity7 has been one of the fiercest debates during the independence campaign			2
defiant : @entity63 has repeatedly insisted that @entity7 would be able to share the pound nationalists , led by @entity63 , insist that an independent @entity7 would be able to carry on using the pound in a formal currency union with the rest of the @entity5			0
however , the leaders of all three major @entity5 parties have ruled out this possibility , saying it would force taxpayers outside @entity7 to guarantee @entity7 's debt			1
if @entity7 does become independent after next thursday 's vote , other options include sharing the pound on an informal basis , setting up a new @entity7 currency or joining the eurozone .			1
