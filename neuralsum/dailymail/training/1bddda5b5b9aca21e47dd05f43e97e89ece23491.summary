by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 10:02 est , 5 november 2012 updated : 12:23 est , 5 november 2012 @entity2 today ordered an independent investigation - likely to be led by a judge - into whether an inquiry ignored claims a senior @entity6 was involved in child abuse in @entity8			1
the prime minister said he would ask an independent figure to review the @entity11 into into abuse at the @entity11 children ’s home in the 1970s and 1980s			1
it follows allegations that a senior unnamed conservative was among those involved in abusing children but were not properly investigate at the time			2
allegations : the former @entity11 children 's home in @entity8 the @entity24 and @entity25 are among departments which have been asked to look into fresh claims of abuse			1
speaking on a trade visit to the @entity30 , mr @entity2 announced he would review the @entity11 to see if it was ' properly constituted '			1
he also announced welsh secretary @entity32 will meet mr @entity33			0
the @entity9 wrote on @entity34 today : ' child abuse is a hateful crime			0
snr figure to lead independent investigation into claims of care home abuse in @entity41 - will report urgently			1
' he later told reporters : ' child abuse is an absolutely hateful and abhorrent crime and these allegations are truly dreadful and they must n't be left hanging in the air , so i 'm taking action today			2
prime minister @entity2 , who is on a trade visit to @entity51 , is taking a ' close interest ' in the child abuse allegations ' so i am taking action today , first of all to make sure that mr @entity33 can meet urgently with the secretary of state for wales so he he can hear his allegations and his points directly			1
' secondly , i am going to be asking a senior independent figure to lead an urgent investigation into whether the original inquiry was properly constituted and properly did its job and to report urgently to the government			1
' but third , i would also urge anyone who knows anything about these matters to go to the police			2
that is where evidence should be taken so that action can be taken and we can deal with this dreadful , dreadful issue			0
' @entity74 said mr @entity2 was taking a ‘ close interest ’ in the issue , as ministers face calls to meet victims who have spoken out			1
it comes after mr @entity33 claimed in an interview with @entity81 ’s @entity80 that he was taken out of @entity11 and ‘ sold ’ to men for sexual abuse at a nearby hotel			1
he wants to meet the @entity9 discuss his own experiences at the home and his claim that a senior @entity6 figure was among those involved in abuse			1
mr @entity33 said a senior @entity6 from the time , who was not named by the programme , had been involved			1
but @entity94 mp @entity93 , who last month claimed there was evidence linking a former @entity98 aide to a paedophile ring , urged mr @entity2 to go further			1
writing an open letter on his blog , mr @entity93 said : ' my advice to you as prime minister – and from one father to another – is that you need to order a special police investigation , outside the affected forces , with proper resources , to review all relevant police files and those of the intelligence services			1
' if they have documents suggesting politicians in the @entity118 or others in positions of power were involved in child abuse then they should make them available to a new inquiry team			0
' he claimed police forces in @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity8 , @entity135 and @entity136 could all be implicated			2
mr @entity93 has also made allegations involving child abuse and a former cabinet minister			2
mr @entity93 added : ' your advisers will tell you to be wary of “ opening the floodgates ”			2
their decorous caution is the friend of the paedophile			0
narrowing the inquiry equals hiding the truth			0
that is the reality and it is not what you want			0
' @entity74 said there was to be a separate process to consider the police response at the time of the original @entity8 allegations			1
earlier , the prime minister ’s official spokesman told a briefing of journalists in @entity163 that the allegations had to be properly investigated			0
‘ on this issue , it is something that we are looking at actively			0
the prime minister has taken a close interest in the reports and the allegations that have been made , ’ the spokesman said			1
‘ we are very clear that those allegations need to be properly investigated and we need to get to the bottom of precisely what happened			0
’ @entity11 claimed on @entity81 's @entity80 that he was abused by a @entity6 politician asked who within @entity180 was looking into the allegations , the spokesman replied : ‘ the government is looking at this issue			1
these issues relate to a number of departments , so clearly it is something we are discussing with the @entity25 and the @entity24 is involved in these issues too			0
‘ there are a number of departments that are involved and we at the centre are taking an active interest in the issue and looking at it very closely			1
’ @entity41 @entity196 was today expected to write to @entity198 first minister @entity197 to demand an inquiry into the latest allegations			0
mr @entity196 said at the weekend : ‘ i would support a full inquiry			0
the fact that we have someone on camera now who was clearly a victim of appalling abuse in @entity11 children ’s home back in the 1970s and 80s , saying that what he wanted to say was outside of the terms of reference , and people told him that he could not say these things and he could n’t talk about people who had abused him , is clearly wrong			1
‘ the fact that he is now saying that and he has now said it so publicly means we have to respond to that			0
’ today welsh first minister @entity197 said he had requested ' urgent advice ' on the original remit of the @entity11 , to help him determine whether a further investigation is needed			1
mr @entity32 added in a statement : ' an extensive inquiry into @entity8 child abuse - the so - called @entity11 - was published in 2000			1
' it was commissioned - before devolution began - by the then secretary of state for wales @entity227 and reported to @entity229 , as secretary of state , in 2000			0
it made extensive recommendations for improving child protection , many of which were subsequently implemented by the @entity180			0
welsh first minister @entity197 today announced he would meet @entity236 @entity196 ' i have asked for urgent advice on the terms of reference of the @entity11 at the time when it was set up			2
' i need to understand fully what was included in those terms of reference and what was excluded			0
in due course that will enable me to consider , with others , whether any further inquiry might be necessary			0
' one of the key recommendations of the @entity11 was the establishment of a children 's commissioner for @entity41			2
i have invited @entity196 to come in and see me tomorrow so that i can hear his thoughts directly			0
' finally , i would like to repeat that any victims of child abuse who feel their cases were not fully investigated , should come forward to the appropriate authorities which means the police or to the children 's commissioner , not to political parties			2
' the original tribunal into the abuse at @entity11 in the 1970s and 80s heard evidence from more than 650 former residents of some 40 children ’s homes between 1974 and 1990			2
it published its report in 2000			0
the inquiry identified 28 alleged perpetrators but they were never identified			0
it was also claimed a second senior @entity6 was named but a court order prevented it from being made public			1
@entity11 ’s deputy head , @entity274 , was jailed in 1994 for ten years for sexually abusing boys			2
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0

@entity74 said @entity2 is taking a ' close interest ' in the issue
judge will look at @entity11 - ordered by @entity285 in 1996
separate process will examine alleged police *failures*
@entity11 told @entity81 's @entity80 last week he was abused by a senior @entity6 figure
@entity94 mp @entity93 claims 11 forces are involved in a cover - up and calls for a ' special police investigation '
