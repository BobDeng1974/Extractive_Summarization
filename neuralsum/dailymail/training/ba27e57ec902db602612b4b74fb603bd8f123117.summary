@entity0 says that the @entity1 are now serious about increasing the number of black and ethnic minority managers in football – but he wants to see substantive results in terms of appointments rather than good intentions			1
@entity0 , who with @entity9 and @entity10 is one of only three black managers in the game , despite 25 per cent of players coming from black and minority backgrounds , takes on @entity15 in the @entity16 on sunday having been appointed by @entity17 at the turn of the year			1
and the former @entity20 manager said : ‘ i see a real enthusiasm from the stakeholders in our game , the @entity25 , certainly the @entity1 and the @entity26 to address some of the imbalances			2
i think we 're seeing an upturn in the number of black and ethnic potential coaches wanting to participate in courses and that 's certainly a way to go			2
but it 's about transparency as well , making sure that black and ethnic coaches are in a position to be interviewed for jobs and of course getting transparency in feedback from clubs			2
@entity0 's @entity17 take on @entity40 side @entity15 in the @entity41 on sunday @entity9 , along with @entity0 and @entity10 , is one of only three black managers in the game ‘ as i said , there 's a real enthusiasm and it 's how you act upon that			1
if we 're hearing things like that from the @entity1 , then it 's their responsibility to see that that comes into practice			0
’ but @entity0 is not a supporter of the ‘ @entity56 ’ , a stipulation by the @entity58 in the @entity59 the football teams had to interview at least one minority candidate for any coaching position to increase diversity			1
‘ i understand and respect the reasoning for the @entity56 ’ said @entity0			1
‘ they saw , similar to here , an under - representation of black coaches at the higher level			0
i 've spoken about a , i think , real enthusiasm to change that			0
and if we can change that without legislation that 's the best way			0
‘ i 'm always conscious of my role and it 's something that i 'm very proud to do			0
when you speak to potential black and ethnic coaches that want to go into the game , one aspect that they always speak about are of course role models in the game			1
they would like to see representation , more at higher level			0
and any part i can play in that i am delighted to do			0
