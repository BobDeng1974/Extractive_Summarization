organic milk could contain a third less iodine than normal milk , scientists claim - but the organic milk industry has issued a swift rebuttal pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers who drink organic milk may be putting their child ’s health at risk , scientists claim			1
they say it contains a third less iodine than normal milk – which could affect infant brain growth and intelligence later in life			0
@entity21 longlife milk was also found to have similarly low levels of the mineral , academics from @entity19 found			1
because milk is the main source of iodine in the @entity29 diet – providing 40 per cent of the average daily intake – switching to organic may have a significant impact on health , they warn			1
the organic milk industry last night issued a swift rebuttal			2
organic milk is often drunk for its supposed health benefits , with claims that it contains omega - 3 fatty acids that are good for the heart			1
and in response to environmental and animal welfare concerns , the sector is growing			0
one in every 20 pints of milk bought is now organic and more than 300 million pints were sold in the @entity29 last year , worth £ 160million			2
but researchers said that because organic farmers do not give their cows as many artificial supplements the milk lacks iodine , which is important for the healthy development of babies in the womb and in their first months of life			2
the mineral is thought to have a major impact on the formation of the brain , with repercussions for iq and school success later in life			0
study author professor @entity64 said the findings could have ‘ serious implications for public health ’			0
he stressed that organic milk was not ‘ bad ’ for health , and said @entity29 could get the same amount of iodine as in a pint of normal milk by drinking an extra half - pint of the organic variety			1
but he warned that without careful monitoring , the country risks ‘ sleepwalking ’ into a new health crisis in the 21st century			0
iodine deficiency was once endemic in parts of the @entity29 , with thousands in the 1930s and 1940s suffering from the thyroid condition goitre			0
the latest findings , published in the journal @entity86 , were based on skimmed , semi-skimmed and full - fat milk purchased at four unnamed supermarkets			0
but the organic milk industry last night said the research – conducted in january last year – was out of date			2
pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers who drink organic milk may be putting their child ’s health at risk due to the smaller amount of iodine in the product			1
iodine is essential for brain growth @entity104 , which provides two - thirds of @entity29 ’s organic milk , said procedures had been changed over the past 18 months to ensure more iodine is fed to dairy herds			1
@entity110 , of the @entity111 , also dismissed the findings , saying organic milk had ‘ scientifically proven ’ health benefits			1
research in 2013 by experts in @entity117 and @entity118 found that children born to women deficient in iodine have a 60 per cent risk of lower iq scores at the age of nine			0
professor @entity125 , one of the authors of that study , last night welcomed the new findings , saying : ‘ milk is a major source of iodine , but it is important to know which sort of milk is most appropriate			0

milk is main source of iodine in @entity29 diet , providing 40 *%* of daily intake
academics say switching to organic milk could significantly impact health
