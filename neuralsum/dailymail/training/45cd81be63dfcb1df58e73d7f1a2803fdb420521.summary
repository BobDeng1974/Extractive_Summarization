by @entity0 the destruction caused by deforestation , wildfires and storms on our planet have been revealed in unprecedented detail			0
high - resolution maps released by @entity9 show how global forests experienced an overall loss of 1.5 million sq km during 2000 - 2012			1
for comparison , that ’s a loss of forested land equal in size to the entire state of @entity17			1
over 12 years , 888,000 square miles ( 2.3 million square kilometers ) of forest were lost , and 309,000 square miles ( 800,000 square kilometers ) regrew the maps , created by a team involving @entity30 , @entity9 and the @entity32 researchers , used images from the @entity22 satellite			1
each pixel in a @entity22 image showing an area about the size of a baseball diamond , providing enough data to zoom in on a local region			0
before this , country - to - country comparisons of forestry data were not possible at this level of accuracy			0
‘ when you put together datasets that employ different methods and definitions , it 's hard to synthesise , ’ said @entity47 at the @entity32			0
the forest cover maps also capture natural disturbances such as this 2011 tornado path in @entity56			0
in this map , the colours represent forest loss by year , with yellows representing loss closer to 2000 and reds representing later forest loss , up to 2012 the @entity65 government yesterday revealed that deforestation in the @entity67 increased by nearly a third over the past year			1
satellite data for the 12 months through the end of july showed that deforestation in the area climbed by 28 per cent compared with a year earlier			1
the total land cleared during the period amounted to 2,256 square miles ( 5,843 square km ) - an area almost the size of @entity76			1
the figure fulfilled predictions by scientists and environmentalists , based on figures compiled through the year , that destruction was on the rise again			0
‘ you ca n't argue with numbers , ’ said @entity84 , coordinator for the @entity67 campaign at the @entity65 chapter of @entity87 , the environmentalist group			2
‘ this is not alarmist - it 's a real and measured inversion of what had been a positive trend			0
’ ‘ with @entity22 , as a polar - orbiting instrument that takes the same quality pictures everywhere , we can apply the same algorithm to forests in the @entity67 , in the @entity99 , in @entity100 , and so on			1
professor @entity47 looked at 143 billion pixels in 654,000 @entity22 images to compile maps of forest loss and gain between 2000 and 2012			2
during that period , 888,000 square miles ( 2.3 million square kilometers ) of forest were lost , and 309,000 square miles ( 800,000 square kilometers ) regrew			2
the team found the deforestation rate in most countries increased			1
@entity100 's deforestation rate doubled in the study period , from approximately 3,900 square miles ( 10,000 square kilometers ) per year in 2000 - 2003 to more than 7,700 square miles ( 20,000 square kilometers ) in 2011 - 2012			1
‘ this is the first time somebody has been able to do a wall - to - wall , global @entity22 analysis of all the world 's forests - where they 're being cleared , where they 're regrowing , and where they 're subject to natural disturbances , ’ said @entity113 , @entity22 project scientist at the @entity114			2
a view of deforestation in the @entity126			0
@entity127 shows forest loss in 2000 - 2012 , blue shows forest gain in the same period , and pink shows both a loss and a gain in the area the maps also illustrate the impact of politics on land cover			1
for instance , on the island of @entity141 , the maps clearly show the border between @entity144 and @entity100			1
@entity144 's heavy logging along forest roads is visible right up to the @entity100 border , where forests were still largely intact as of 2012			1
in @entity150 , a civil war in 2002 corresponded with intense deforestation of several previously protected nature reserves			0
a different pattern of change appears in the southeastern @entity155 , where landowners harvest trees for timber and quickly plant their replacements ' ‘ of this eco-region in the southeast , 30 per cent of the forest land was regrown or lost during this period , ’ professor @entity47 said			0
civil unrest in @entity150 was associated with widespread deforestation in national parks , including @entity167			0
other protected areas , such as @entity169 , remained intact ‘ it 's incredibly intensive			0
trees are really treated like a crop in this region			0
’ in @entity56 , @entity22 detected miles - long streaks of destroyed forest			0
when the researchers examined the year - by - year record , they found the damage occurred in 2011 after a violent tornado season			0
@entity65 cut its deforestation rate from approximately 15,400 square miles ( 40,000 square kilometers ) per year to approximately 7,700 square miles ( 20,000 square kilometers ) per year			1
‘ that 's the result of a concerted policy effort to reduce deforestation , and it sets a standard for the rest of the world , ’ professor @entity47 said			2
however , the @entity65 government yesterday revealed that deforestation in the @entity67 increased by nearly a third over the past year			1
the border between @entity144 and @entity100 on the island of @entity141 stands out in the @entity22 - based map of forest disturbance			2
red pixels represent forest loss between 2000 and 2012 satellite data for the 12 months through the end of july showed that deforestation in the area climbed by 28 per cent compared with a year earlier			1
although scattered , the total land cleared during the period amounted to 2,256 square miles ( 5,843 square km ) - an area almost the size of the @entity155 state of @entity76			1
the figure , fulfilled predictions by scientists and environmentalists , based on figures compiled through the year , that destruction was on the rise again			0

@entity127 shows forest loss in 2000 - 2012 , blue shows forest gain in the same period , while pink shows both a loss and a gain in the area			2

maps show how forests experienced an overall loss of 1.5 million sq km
for comparison , this is equal to the size to the entire state of @entity17
deforestation in the @entity67 increased by nearly a third over the past year
meanwhile , @entity100 's deforestation rate doubled in the study period
