what started as an april fool ’s joke by an @entity4 brewery has resulted in the production of a rather unique new type of beer , made using bulls ' testicles			0
the @entity10 in @entity11 produced a spoof video touting the daring ingredient in a fake product called @entity15 last april as a publicity stunt for april fool ’s day			1
despite the video containing some fairly tongue - in - cheek lines it seems the joke was lost on many and the company was inundated with requests for samples of the special beer			1
so did many patrons who came to the pub to try the beer			0
so we ’ve turned our joke into a reality			0
’ the first eight barrels were made for the @entity53 , held in @entity11 later this month , and contains a massive 11kg of bull testicles , all lovingly sliced and roasted by @entity10 sous chef @entity56			1
the april fool ’s video features head brewer @entity59 praising the @entity10 ’s tradition of ‘ trailblazing ’ in the field and sourcing new ingredients , especially those with a ‘ strong regional flavor			1
’ trailblazing : the @entity10 is based in @entity11 and will premier their new product at the @entity53 later this month the magic ingredient : the testicles are from free range @entity70 cattle and are described as ' really fresh ' a brewer then explains : ‘ fried bull testicles or @entity36 are a @entity70 favorite			1
‘ this makes them the perfect ingredient to showcase in a new style of beer we ’ve created , which really pays tribute to one of @entity70 ’s unique culinary jewels			2
’ a voice over lists the ingredients as organic @entity88 , hops , @entity90 water , and bull testicles from free range @entity70 cattle			0
‘ we ’re adding the @entity36 whole into the kettle to give the full flavour and nuances into the beer ‘ when making this style of beer it ’s important to use the freshest ingredients possible , and these testicles … they ’re very fresh			0
’ keeping it local : head brewer @entity59 argues the testicles have a ' strong regional flavor ' the result of our efforts is a luscious creamy stout that delivers loads of flavor , everything from roasted barley and coffee , to chocolate ... and nuts ’ the video ends by informing customers that there is a limit of two cans per head , presumably to prevent a wave of bulk buying on the part of enthusiastic , and daring , drinkers			2
