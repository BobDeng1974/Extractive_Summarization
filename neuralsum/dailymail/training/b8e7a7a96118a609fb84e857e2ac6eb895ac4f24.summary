by @entity0 published : 12:36 est , 3 december 2013 updated : 13:05 est , 3 december 2013 public figure : @entity2 was incorrectly identified in an obituary and now he has spent days reassuring friends that he is alive and well an @entity6 man had the rare chance to read his own obituary over the weekend when his local paper mistakenly reported that he had died			1
@entity2 , 66 , was alive and well when his landline and cell phone started ringing off the hook on saturday with concerned friends calling after seeing his picture and obituary in the local paper			1
' it was a good friend of mine who said " are you alright ? i said " sure i 'm alright ! " ' mr @entity2 told @entity23			0
the next call was from his wife who was at work and had received an angry call from a friend who was mad that they had n't been told of her husband 's passing			0
‘ i said i need to go get a paper and see what this is all about , ’ mr @entity2 said			0
as he made his way to the front of his @entity38 , @entity6 house to pick up the latest issue of @entity40 , he was met by another friend who had driven over to his house to see if the story was true			2
the confusion began when the editor of the county - wide paper received a death notice for a 77 - year - old @entity49 of @entity50 , @entity6 from a funeral home			1
‘ i got a good surprise , that ’s for sure , ’ mr @entity2 told @entity23			0
one of the paper ’s editors , @entity53 , was friends with the living , breathing 66 - year - old @entity58 who was born and raised in @entity50 , so rather than simply letting his friend ’s death notice run with the names of his survivors and funeral arrangements , mr @entity53 added detail about his storied career in local government and law enforcement			1
‘ he knew me so he was going to give me a better write up than just the generic announcement			2
’ that initiative added to the problem , since the obituary went through the living mr @entity2 ’s 28 - year career in law enforcement , his two - terms as a county commissioner and prominently featured his picture			1
what did n’t match were the names of the ‘ deceased ’s ’ parents and children , the names of which matched that of the 77 - year - old mr @entity2 who has died			1
the mix up was not the most outlandish situation as there are several @entity96 in the county given their family ’s long roots in the area			0
the @entity58 who was pictured told @entity23 that he is ‘ distant , distant , distant , distant cousins ’ with the deceased @entity49			2
alive and well : @entity58 , pictured , was described in a local obituary after his ' distant , distant , distant , distant cousin ' named @entity49 died last week ‘ i know him ( but ) i ’m not that close , ’ mr @entity2 said of the gentleman who died			1
a retraction will be published in wednesday ’s issue of @entity40 and mr @entity2 had one specific item that he wants included : his wife @entity109			2
because her name was not listed as a survivor in the incorrect obituary , ‘ everyone in the county ’s gone thinking that we ’re divorced ! ’ mr @entity2 said that with the exception of the obvious mistakes - like the fact that he is alive and that the names of his relatives were incorrect - he would have been happy with the obituary that was used , should his time come			0
‘ my pastor in church talked about it in front of 300 people , saying “ there are n’t many people who get to see their own obituary , ” ’ mr @entity2 said			0
watch the video here @entity133 from @entity134 @entity134			0

@entity49 , 77 , died last week and the funeral home sent a death announcement to the local paper in @entity6
the editor at @entity40 is friends with @entity58 , 66 , and thought that he had passed so wanted to give him a better write up
included details about the younger maze 's career in local politics and *accompanied* the *article* with his picture
the 66 - year - old is not dead and spent the weekend *fielding* calls from concerned friends and family
