@entity0 may not have won at @entity1 since 1983 — but captain @entity2 insists there is no reason why @entity6 ’s men should head south with an inferiority complex this weekend			1
from what he has seen in his first season in the @entity10 with @entity11 , @entity2 reckons @entity13 ’s players are anything but invincible			1
they are good , he says , but no better than those currently wearing the dark blue			2
@entity0 captain greig @entity2 ( above ) insists that @entity13 are not invincible ahead of saturday 's clash ‘ i ’ve always thought highly of the @entity13 players but seeing them down there just shows me that we can win , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ they are not invincible , that ’s definitely not the case			0
‘ i believe they are good players but you look at @entity27 when they played @entity28 in @entity29 this season and how well they did			0
‘ @entity28 were going well in the @entity10 but @entity31 beat them at home and arguably could have won down there , too			0
it was n’t really @entity31 ’s first team as they had a lot of injuries that day — and it probably was close to @entity28 ’s first team			0
’ @entity2 ’s emotions are running high ahead of the @entity40 clash , especially after team - mate @entity41 told @entity42 he feels there is a lack of respect for @entity47 rugby south of the border			1
@entity2 made a similar point before the start of the @entity51 , based on the experiences of his first season with @entity11 , following his move from @entity55			1
@entity0 full back @entity41 ( left ) accused the @entity57 of lacking respect for @entity47 rugby for @entity2 , a win at @entity1 will not only belatedly ignite @entity0 ’s @entity51 campaign , following defeats to @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 , it will give him bragging rights in the @entity11 dressing room and make him even more proud to be a @entity67 south of the border			1
‘ @entity69 has to be earned and that is something we ’ll be aiming to do at the weekend , ’ he said			0
‘ the @entity13 boys will respect us if we do a job on the field			1
‘ we ’re not far away from getting things right but i ’m getting pretty sick of telling people that , i really am			0
it ’s up to us as players to step up , go again and put in that performance against @entity13			1
‘ we have had some tough talking from the coaches this week and rightly so since the defeat to @entity64 — but it has been good as we have been shooting ourselves in the foot a lot of the time and we have to change			0
‘ we have now seen both sides of @entity6 this week			0
he is a hard man and rightly so			0
he has high standards and we have certainly seen what he is all about — and that ’s good			0
we know what is expected of us and he is a very clever coach who wants to make sure we come away from @entity1 with a positive result			1
’ @entity2 also has two very personal reasons for wanting to lead @entity0 to what would be a famous victory at @entity1			1
the first is to emulate his uncle , @entity97 , who helped his team to a @entity40 win back in 1983			0
the other is to wipe out the memory of last year ’s 20 - 0 defeat by @entity13 at @entity102			1
it still makes him bristle and was arguably his worst performance in a @entity0 shirt			1
@entity13 captain @entity106 lifts the @entity40 at @entity102 last year after a 20 - 0 victory nothing went right for @entity2 that day and , after missing two penalties and struggling to make any sort of impression on the game , the @entity0 skipper was replaced by @entity114 after 65 minutes			1
the boos that rang round the stadium at the final whistle hurt @entity2 and he knows that defeat , on top of @entity0 ’s dreadful @entity51 campaign so far this season , makes it vitally important to put things right at the home of @entity57 rugby			1
‘ that was personally one of my worst games for @entity0 , to be honest , ’ he admitted			1
‘ i do n’t think many of the boys played well that day for whatever reason			0
‘ it was made worse because we were playing @entity13			2
it is the oldest game in the world and you want to do yourself proud — and we did n’t			0
‘ @entity6 ’s analysis this week has been about going back a bit further into previous @entity51 tournaments and he has been on our case			2
he has certainly been on my case , that ’s for sure , after he brought up that match			0
‘ we ’ve had a look at that last game when we lost 20 - 0 and he pointed out mistakes in that match and told us we need to learn quickly and not make those same mistakes again			2
‘ we certainly want to turn around that defeat and how we have performed in this @entity51 , if we can , by winning at @entity1 and there is slightly more added spice to the fixture because it is @entity13 down there			1
‘ i ’ve talked to my uncle @entity153 about their win in 1983 but that was a different group of players and the guys who won more than 30 years ago have made their own bit of history			0
‘ it ’s up to us now to make our own bit of history and go down there and be strong and have the mentality that we can impose our game on them — and not worry about what is coming out of the other changing room			0
’ @entity13 centre @entity170 is mobbed by his team - mates after he scored a try in last year 's match much will rest on the performance of second - row @entity176 , who turns 21 on saturday			1
he has already come of age for @entity0 and is calling the line - outs			2
in the absence of big brother @entity182 through injury , there is now even more responsibility on his shoulders			0
there was an indication against the @entity188 of how much @entity176 is respected by @entity6 when , with @entity2 taken off and vice-captain @entity189 off injured , he was asked to fill in as skipper near the end of the game			2
it was a dream come true for the second row , who knows he has a huge role to play against @entity13			2
‘ it ’s very special to be a part of the @entity0 squad in the first place , then to lead your country is something you grow up dreaming about , ’ he said			2
‘ to have done that , even if for only a couple of minutes against @entity64 , was a huge honour and a very special feeling			0
@entity176 ( above ) will have a big role to play if @entity0 are to upset the odds and beat @entity13 ‘ the result was hugely disappointing but we have to put that behind us now			1
‘ we have been looking at the @entity13 game and what we need to fix and we ’re just training hard to try to get it right			2
‘ it will be a huge occasion in an amazing stadium against a tough @entity13 team			2
they have got a very strong pack and the driving maul is a real strength of theirs , so that is an area we will be working hard on this week			0
