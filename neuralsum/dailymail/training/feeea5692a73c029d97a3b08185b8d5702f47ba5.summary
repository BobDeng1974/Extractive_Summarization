a radio host ’s integrity is being questioned on social media after he fell into the trap of pranksters impersonating guests over the phone twice in the past couple of months			1
talkback host @entity9 was led to believe he was talking to @entity11 rapper 360 on his @entity13 radio show on monday - while the legitimate artist was filming himself listening to the impersonator be interviewed and then posted the footage on his @entity18 page			1
it is the second time @entity9 has been caught with egg on his face after a @entity23 man , living in @entity24 , pretended to be @entity26 commander @entity25 during a phone interview in august			1
360 , whose real name is @entity50 , took great delight in filming himself listening to the show where the impersonator told @entity9 that he had joined the @entity55 – an historical secret society			1
‘ i was inducted because i am enlightened , ’ the caller said when @entity9 questioned that calling himself enlightened being was racist			2
‘ it has nothing to ( do with ) race it ’s a mind frame , ’ the fake 360 said			2
the conversation then became even more bizarre when the prankster declared himself as a unicorn			0
‘ who are you to say i ’m not a unicorn ? ’ he said			0
‘ all i ’m trying to do is open everyone ’s minds up to these racist ideals and you are just trying to stomp them out			0
’ it was n’t until the caller mentioned the previous prank that @entity9 began to question his identity			2
‘ last few weeks did n’t you interview an @entity26 fighter who turned out not to be an @entity26 fighter at all ? ’ he asked			1
‘ yeah , we did and we acknowledged that , are you sure you ’re @entity50 here ? ’ @entity79 replied			0
rapper 360 gets stuck into @entity9 in one of many posts about the hoax the artist known as 360 - aka @entity50 - in hysterics when the prankster tells @entity86 that he is a unicorn a @entity88 incredulous as to how the studio did n't check who the caller was before going to air although the impersonator never admitted to the hoax , he went on to ask about the show ’s screening process			1
‘ how much research goes into who you actually interview ? or do they just ring up and say “ hi i ’m 360 ” and i come on ? ’ he said			2
after almost nine minutes , @entity9 ended the interview and then conceded on @entity34 that his guest was in fact an impersonator			1
' spoke to someone on - air and off - air who said that he was rapper 360			1
turns out he was n't			0
we shut the interview down immediately , ' he posted			2
the authentic 360 took to @entity34 with several posts			0
' 1 thing i hope everyone takes tonight is dont believe eveything the media tells you , ' one said			0
this prompted many fellow @entity88 to ridicule @entity9 for falling for the stunt a second time			0
it was suggested @entity9 was also about to interview @entity119 , @entity120 , 2pac and @entity121			1
some posted saying they had lost all credibility for the talk back host			0
' it lieterally took me 30 seconds to find 3ree6ixty 's manger 's contact info			0
do you even know what research is ? clown			0
@entity9 is ridiculed on @entity34 with people having a dig at his credibility as a journalist			1
