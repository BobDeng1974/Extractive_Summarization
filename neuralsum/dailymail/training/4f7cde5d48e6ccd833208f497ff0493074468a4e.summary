it may have taken 36 years but the iconic holographic chess game from @entity2 : a @entity2 just took a step closer to reality thanks to a pair of augmented and virtual reality specs			0
the @entity8 system uses a pair of glasses fitted with a micro-projector on each lens that beams images in @entity14 onto a specially - designed flat surface			1
these images can then be moved and interacted with using a remote control wand			1
each micro-projector receives a video stream via a @entity25 connection and beams these images in @entity14 onto retro - reflective sheeting			1
the images can then be moved and interacted with using a remote control wand @entity29 was a game played in @entity31			1
this scene shows the game being played by @entity34 , pictured left , and @entity36 , right			0
it used holograms of playing pieces , such as aliens			0
the rules differed from regular chess , as it was played on a circular board , rather than square @entity47 's system is made of a pair of glasses and a surface			2
the frames of the glasses are fitted with two micro-projectors - one for each eye			1
each projector beams a perspective view of a stereoscopic @entity57 onto the retro - reflective surface			1
a tiny camera , fitted between the projectors , scans for infrared identification markers placed on this surface			2
the camera uses these markers to precisely track a player 's head position and orientation in the physical world			0
the so - called @entity69 can be used as a joystick and a ' 3d input device			2
' the handheld part of the wand has buttons , a trigger , and a thumb stick			0
the wand also tracks its own movement in 3d space , allowing players to interact with virtual environments			1
a @entity83 project has now launched in the hope of raising $ 400,000 ( £ 250,000 ) to fund production of this system			0
' @entity47 is a projected augmented reality system that displays holographic - like 3d projections right in front of you , ' said the system 's @entity92 - based maker @entity94			2
' @entity31 : @entity2 – a @entity2 sparked our imaginations of what might be possible in the future by showing @entity99 and @entity36 playing a holographic chess - style game			0
' it has taken years for this technological dream to come to reality , but with @entity8 , that reality can be yours			2
' @entity47 's system is made of a pair of glasses and a surface			2
the frames of the glasses are fitted with two micro-projectors - one for each eye			1
each projector beams a perspective view of a stereoscopic @entity57 onto the retro - reflective surface			1
a tiny camera , fitted between the projectors , scans for infrared identification markers placed on this surface			2
this camera has a built - in tracking system that detects slight movements of a player 's eyes and hands , and moves the images so they stay in line with their head			1
this means a player 's eyes focus on the projected image at a ' very natural and comfortable viewing distance			0
' a tracking grid sits underneath the retro - reflective surface and when used with tags , or specially created game boards , can track physical objects including miniature figures , cards , game pieces , or anything else that fits on top of the surface			1
the camera uses these markers to precisely track a player 's head position and orientation in the physical world			0
software can then adjust how the holographic scene should appear			0
@entity47 's system consists of a pair of glasses and a specially - designed viewing surface			1
each projector , fitted to the frames of the glasses , pictured , beams 3d images onto the retro - reflective surface			1
a camera , fitted between the projectors , scans for infrared identification markers placed on this surface in @entity2 : a @entity2 , a hologram of princess @entity169 is beamed from @entity99 , pictured the glasses get its video signal through an @entity25 connection and the camera is connected by a usb port to a pc			1
@entity94 said it is still experimenting with linking the glasses to other mobile devices			0
the so - called @entity69 can be used as a joystick and a ' 3d input device			0
' the handheld part of the wand has buttons , a trigger , and a thumb stick			0
the wand also tracks its own movement in 3d space , allowing players to interact with virtual environments			2
the @entity83 project runs until 14 november and has already raised more than half the target amount			0
according to the pledge information , a @entity69 costs $ 60 ( £ 38 ) and a starter pack that includes the glasses and the surface is $ 189 ( £ 118 ) .			0

the @entity8 system uses glasses fitted with projectors on each lens
micro-projectors receive a video stream via a @entity25 connection
these images are beamed onto a specially - designed retro - reflective sheet
players move and interact with the images using a remote control wand
