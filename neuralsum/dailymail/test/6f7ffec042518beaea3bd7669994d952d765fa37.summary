the mysterious @entity1 statues of @entity2 have gazed inland for hundreds of years			2
and now experts believe they have finally discovered how the @entity5 people placed distinctive ' hats ' made of red stone on top of some of the figures ’ heads , more than 700 years ago			1
they believe that the hats , or ' pukao ' , were rolled up ramps to reach the top of the figures which measure up to 40ft ( 12 metres ) tall			1
mystery solved ? experts believe they have finally discovered how the @entity5 people placed distinctive hats made of red stone on top of some of the @entity2 figures ’ heads , more than 700 years ago despite the size of the statues , @entity21 an undergraduate student in archaeology and geology at the @entity25 , believes the rolling of the bulky stones would have been relatively easy			1
‘ it seems like a relatively small number of people could have done it , either by levering or rolling , ’ he told the @entity30 of the @entity31			2
this is despite the largest pukaos measuring six - and - a - half feet ( two metres ) in diameter and weighing 12 tonnes ( 1,890 stone )			2
some 1,000 carved @entity1 line the perimeter of the 12 mile ( 25km ) volcanic island , which is the most isolated inhabited landmass on @entity43 with just 6,000 residents			0
a tall order : physicists believe that the pukao , or ' hats , ' were rolled up ramps to reach the top of the figures ( examples are pictured left and right ) , some of which measure up to 40 ft ( 12 metres ) tall remote : some 1,000 carved @entity1 line the perimeter of the 12 mile ( 25km ) volcanic island , which is the most isolated inhabited landmass on @entity43 with just 6,000 residents the @entity1 are monolithic human figures carved by the @entity5 people on @entity2 , between 1,250 and 1,500 ad			1
all the figures have overly - large heads and are thought to be living faces of deified ancestors			0
the 887 statues gaze inland across the island with an average height of 13ft ( four metres )			1
all but 53 of the @entity1 were carved from tuff - compressed volcanic ash - and around 100 wear red pukao of scoria			1
in 1979 archaeologists said the statues were designed to hold coral eyes			0
the figures are believed to be symbol of authority and power			0
they may have embodied former chiefs and were repositories of spirits or ' mana '			0
they are positioned so that ancient ancestors watch over the villages , while seven look out to sea to help travellers find land			0
but it is a mystery as to how the vast carved stones were transported into position			0
the island is half the size of the @entity92 , or twice the size of @entity94 , and lies 2,236 miles ( 3,600km ) west of the @entity96 mainland			0
since @entity98 came to @entity2 , or @entity5 , in the 1700s , people have wondered how the vast carved stones were erected , complete with their ' hats '			1
some experts believe the stones were walked into place , while others have suggested that locals chopped down trees to roll the statues into position , unwittingly destroying the forests and causing their own demise through lack of natural resources			1
an estimated 100 pukao have been discovered so far , either in place on the statues , or scattered nearby			1
they are made from red volcanic rock called scoria and experts are divided as to what they may have been , with suggestions ranging from hairstyles to turbans and diadems			0
despite this , many agree that the red colour of the stone indicates that the pukao had ritual significance			1
mr @entity21 ’s team used basic physics to model the force and torque required to place a pukao on a @entity1 ’s head , using different techniques			1
these included rolling a ‘ hat ’ up a ramp , building a tower , using a pulley system and putting the ‘ hat ’ on the statue before raising the whole statue as one			0
they concluded that the rounded oblong shape of the pukao means that it would have required relatively little energy to roll them up a ramp			0
standing guard : an estimated 100 pukao have been discovered so far , either in place on the statues or scattered nearby			1
this map shows the location of the 887 statues , which gaze inland across the island , with an average height of 13ft ( four metres ) it may have been possible for less than 10 men to roll a ‘ hat ’ into place , because the oblong shape stopped it easily rolling down the ramp again , but was still a good shape for being hauled upwards			1
some of the statues have indentations which may have stopped them tipping over during placement of the pukao			1
and a number of the ‘ hats also have vertical marks and ring - shaped indentations on their side , which may indicate that strips of wood were used to provide traction up the ramp			0
however , while the team thinks ramps were the most likely method for the placing of the hats , their models revealed that any of the proposed methods for raising the pukao would have been possible - with enough manpower			1
erosion and damage have also scarred the sides of the pukao , meaning that analysis of marks and scratches is ' far from conclusive '			0
it is not known exactly how the vast @entity2 statues came to line the perimeter of the small island			2
but in 2013 , scientists claimed they may have been walked into position			0
a team led by @entity209 @entity208 from the @entity210 , and @entity211 of the @entity212 claimed the statues ' bases were carved so they could lean forward to make them easier to transport			2
walk the walk : a team of experts created a five - tonne replica of one of the statues and moved it into an upright position on a dirt path in @entity224 , to prove that the statues could have been ' walked ' into place the researchers illustrated the theory by creating a five - tonne replica of one of the statues and moving it into an upright position on a dirt path in @entity224			2
with just a few ropes , a team of 18 people could rock the statue back and forth , each time inching the statue on just a little bit more			2
the mode of transport would have taken about two weeks			0
the bases would then have been flattened to stand the statues upright once they reached position			0
mr @entity208 said the findings may help dismantle the traditional story line of @entity2 , or @entity5 , that a ' crazed maniacal group destroyed their environment , ' by cutting down trees to transport gigantic statues			1
previous studies have suggested that a lost civilization chopped down trees on the island , laid the statues prone and rolled them into place using logs .			2

@entity5 people placed red stone ' hats ' or pukao on some of the statues
@entity25 say they may have used ramps to raise the stones
the team used physics to model possible methods of raising the ' hats '
some 100 pukao have been found on the remote island in the @entity274
