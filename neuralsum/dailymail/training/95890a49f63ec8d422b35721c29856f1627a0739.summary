but in fact , it was a cunning ruse to hoodwink horseflies and enjoy a peaceful , bite - free summer			1
his owner @entity13 daubed the black stallion with cattle - paint on her farm in @entity18 , in @entity19 , in a novel attempt to protect it from the blood - sucking insects			1
she came up with the trick after learning that zebras in the wild never get bitten by the hungry pests , which have a nasty bite and spread lethal blood diseases			2
one fine trick : @entity13 daubed the stallion with with cattle - paint on her farm in @entity18 , in @entity19 , in a novel attempt to protect it from the blood - sucking insects @entity32 : when the horse rejoined his herd dressed up like a zebra , they all thought he was taking them for a ride creature comfort : @entity13 feeds the painted stallion and one of his friends the revelation was first made by researchers from @entity48 in @entity49 last year , when they realised black and white stripes are unappetising to horseflies because they reflect light in a certain way			1
after months of forensic testing , they discovered that the bugs far prefer the ' flat ' light produced by much darker coats			2
power of science : the revelation was first made by researchers from @entity48 in @entity49 last year , when they realised black and white stripes are unappetizing to horseflies because they reflect light in a certain way cunning ruse : @entity13 came up with the trick after learning that zebras in the wild never get bitten by the hungry pests , which have a nasty bite and spread lethal blood diseases tests were carried out in @entity73 using life - sized cardboard cut - outs of horses painted white , brown , and with stripes and spots			1
hate stripes : horseflies have a nasty bite and spread lethal blood diseases the models were coated with oil and glue to trap the insects			1
' we started off studying horses with black , brown or white coats , ' lead researcher @entity88 from @entity48 told the @entity89 at the time			2
' we found that in the black and brown horses , we get horizontally polarised light			0
from a white coat , you get unpolarised light			0
' @entity88 explained that horse flies do n’t like this type of light but surprisingly , in experiments , were found to hate striped coats even more			1
and the narrower the stripes , the more they kept away			0
she said : ‘ we were expecting to find that a striped coat , having half of the coat covered with a black surface and half white to show intermediate attraction to the horseflies , but in fact it was as good or even better than the white surface in terms of attracting few horse flies			1
’ dr @entity88 acknowledged that there are competing theories about why zebras evolved stripes , such as camouflage against predators , thermoregulation , a way of recognising other herd members and to stimulate grooming , but she argues that they have not been critically tested			0
horse flies , however , can kill - which would provide the necessary evolutionary pressure for stripes			0
she added : ' we think we have a strong case because @entity130 [ horse flies ] transfer diseases to their hosts , some of which are lethal			0
and their bites are irritating and will disturb grazing mammals			0
' cheeky ! the stallion is now so comfortable he is up to his old tricks , picking food from @entity13 's pockets share the paint : the paint takes about thirty minutes to apply , leaving time for @entity13 to paint one or two of the other animals too			2

@entity13 daubed the stallion with cattle - paint in @entity18 , in @entity19
the paint is in fact a ruse to *prevent* horseflies from biting the horse
she came up with the trick after learning that zebras never get bitten
scientists have found black and white stripes are unappetising to horseflies
horseflies hate how stripes reflect light and prefer ' flat ' light of dark coats
