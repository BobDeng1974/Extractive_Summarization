by @entity0 and @entity1 an @entity3 farmer was today given permission to use thousands of pounds of taxpayer ’s money to sue the @entity8 government … for sending international aid to his homeland			1
the ‘ farcical case ’ – which has provoked fury at @entity14 - will be entirely funded by the @entity8 public			2

international development secretary @entity21 is being forced to defend the government over claims that her department is funding a one - party state in @entity3 this is on top of the £ 1.3billion @entity8 has already spent pouring aid into @entity3			1
ministers had urged the @entity30 to reject the case , which the farmer – who has not set foot in @entity8 – is fighting from abroad			2
but mr @entity34 said it raised important questions about the government ’s controversial aid programme and must proceed to a full judicial review			0
the 33 - year - old @entity3 – granted anonymity to protect his family – says @entity20 is funding a one - party state in his country that has breached his human rights			2
he says it has propped up a regime that has driven thousands of farmers from their land and wants a declaration the policy is unlawful			1
he was given legal aid despite lodging the court papers from @entity56 , where he is now living			1
it made it through the system just before justice secretary @entity61 introduces rules to prevent cases being lodged by applicants who have never set foot in the @entity8			0
the proposals , due to be enacted in august , would mean anybody seeking legal aid in civil cases must have been resident in @entity8 for at least 12 months			1
a @entity71 source said : ‘ whatever hardships this man has faced , the idea that someone without any connection to this country whatsoever can get public money to sue the @entity22 borders on the farcical			0
' when taxpayers here are still feeling the pinch after the economic crisis , it simply ca n't be right that their money is being dished out like this			0
’ a farmer , known only as ‘ o ’ , is accusing the @entity8 government of breaching @entity8 human rights laws by effectively propping up the repressive regime of @entity3 prime minister @entity92 ( pictured ) the case , to be heard by mr @entity34 , shines a light on both the huge sums being spent by @entity20 and the lax legal aid system which the @entity97 inherited from the last @entity99 government			1
the farmer , known only as ‘ o ’ , is accusing @entity20 of breaching its own human rights rules by effectively propping up a repressive regime in @entity3 – which is one of the biggest recipients of @entity8 overseas aid			1
