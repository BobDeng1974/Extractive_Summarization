overlooked details in the infamous lawsuit that won an elderly woman was awarded $ 2.86million after spilling a cup of scalding @entity5 coffee on herself have been revealed in a re-examination of the case			1
@entity10 's lawsuit was turned into a punch - line as many news outlets overlooked the critical facts of the case including the nearly 700 other complaints that @entity5 had received about their hot coffee			1
a new video produced by @entity18 shows the graphic photos of the third - degree burns that then - 79 - year - old @entity10 received on her groin , saying that after viewing the physical damage that she underwent they decided to give her a hefty sum			1
warning graphic content victim : @entity10 was 79 - years - old when she suffered third - degree burns to her groin after spilling a cup of scalding coffee on herself while sitting in a parked car they initially decided to order the restaurant chain to pay her $ 160,000 in medical expenses and compensatory damages , as well as an additional $ 2.7million in punitive damages			1
the judge was the one to reduce that amount down to $ 640,000 before the final payout was settled out of court			0
what was n't commonly reported was the way in which the jury came up with the $ 2.7million figure			0
at the time , @entity5 earned roughly $ 1.33million per day on coffee sales alone , so the jury felt it was appropriate for them to pay the equivalent of two day 's earnings			1
another point in mrs @entity10 's favor - which was pointed out in a documentary called ' @entity10 ' - was the fact that @entity5 ordered workers to brew their coffee between 180 degrees and 190 degrees			1
typical at - home coffee machines brew their drinks at about 30 degrees lower			2
infamous : the details of her lawsuit were kept confidential for much of the case , making many see it as outrageous that a jury awarded her $ 2.9million in damages from @entity5 verdict : the judge lowered the pay out to $ 640,000 and then they finally settled out of court , but what many did not understand was that $ 2.7m of the $ 2.9m made up two days of coffee profits for the fast food giant warning : this photo was one shown to the jury where they saw the skin graft that had to be taken out of mrs @entity10 's leg to replace the skin that had suffered third degree burns in her groin a doctor testified that a 180 - degree liquid can cause third - degree burns in less than 15 seconds			1
that is what happened to mrs @entity10			0
she was sitting in the passenger seat of her grandson 's parked car when she put the coffee between her knees and spilt it in her lap. @entity95 to judgement : her case was seen as an example of being overly litigious , but many did not know the real details ' all i remember was trying to get out of the car			1
i screamed , not realizing i was burned that bad			0
i just knew i was in terrible pain , ' she said in a television interview			0
she sustained burns over 16 per cent of her body , and doctors later determined that 6 per cent of that area were classified as third - degree burns			1
she spent a week in the hospital being treated for the burns , which racked up $ 10,000 in medical expenses			2
@entity18 states that mrs @entity10 sent a letter to the fast food giant asking for them to pay for her medical expenses and they said that they would give her $ 800 to settle the issue			2
she went on to try two more times to settle out of court before taking it to a judge and jury			0
' i was not in it for the money			0
i was in it because i wanted them to bring the temperature down so that other people would not go through the same thing i did , ' mrs @entity10 said in an interview included in the @entity129			0
mrs @entity10 's case turned into the touchstone for complaints about excessive litigation , but many did not know the details of the case due to her inability to speak out after signing on to the confidential agreement reached between she and @entity5			2
she died at the age of 91 in 2004			0
' the emotion that she went through - she just felt that people were coming at her , ' her daughter @entity140 said in the documentary .			0

@entity10 was 79 - years - old in 1992 when she was in her grandson 's parked car and spilled coffee on her lap
she stayed in the hospital for a week while doctors treated her third - degree burns and they *feared* she would not survive
a jury eventually awarded her $ 2.9million and the case gained national attention - even though the final sum she was paid is still *unknown*
her *lawyers* *argued* that @entity5 had to lower the temperature of their coffee from their standard 180 to 190 degree setting
