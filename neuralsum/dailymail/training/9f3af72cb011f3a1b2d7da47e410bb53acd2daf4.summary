by @entity0 published : 14:13 est , 17 march 2013 updated : 14:13 est , 17 march 2013 a @entity2 academy has become the first school in @entity4 to introduce a 10am start after research showed that teenagers do not fully wake up until mid-morning			1
headmistress of the @entity9 , @entity10 , allows children to arrive at 10am but to leave at 5.30pm			1
she argues that the school , which has been open since september , is already seeing positive results			2
@entity13 : the @entity9 opened six months ago and introduced a 10am start after research showed that teenagers perform better later in the day she told @entity18 : ‘ youngsters are turning up alert and ready to learn and are focused and engaged in lessons			1
‘ we have no hard data on exam results yet , since we have only been open six months , but the aim is to rigorously review the effects			0
pupil and teacher surveys have so far been positive			0
’ there have been calls to expand the project across @entity4 after research from the school ’s sponsors , @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 showed that teenagers are predisposed to go to bed later and waking between 9am and 10am			2
this pattern , named the adolescent ‘ time shift ’ , continues until the body clock starts to change at the age of 21			0
pupils at the school , which is the first in the @entity4 to be sponsored by a university , have had a positive response , with some adding that they are able to eat a nourishing breakfast and read through lessons before school starts			1
biologically predisposed : the study shows that teenagers are more receptive and involved in classes when they have had a later start to the day academics in @entity56 have shown that forcing teenagers to wake up before the body clock tells them to can stunt their academic growth			1
a 2011 study involving 19 - year - olds from the @entity56 air force found that those who started classes at 850am instead of 7am achieved higher results in their exams			0
@entity29 professor , @entity67 and former head teacher @entity68 are set to present a paper on the research later this year			0
@entity71 said that he believed schools across the country should start later as they : ‘ improve learning , but the sleep deprivation from enforced early starts has an effect on kids ' mental health			0

the @entity9 introduced the later start when it opened in september
this comes after research shows that teens do *n't* wake up before 10
pupils have been more alert and engaged in lessons , according to the school
