in the street battle for supremacy between man and baboon , it can only be said that both sides are using guerrilla tactics			1
for the baboons it means swarming @entity10 style up the sheer sides of blocks of flats , prising open windows and plundering anything that is inside			1
usually they just want food , but sometimes a flapping set of net curtains or a child ’s cuddly toy bear can provide some added entertainment			2
for the humans , the weapons of choice – given that their enemy is a protected species – tend to be paintball guns and pepper sprays			1
they have the momentary effect of driving the baboons away , but hunger and sheer nerve always bring them back			1
go away ! an angry resident at the @entity39 apartment block is trying to scare off the group of @entity41 ( @entity41 ) to no avail - he can be seen here in the centre of the picture shaking his fist at the monkeys from one of his windows we 'll have that : two baboons have managed to get hold of a teddy bear through an open window into a child 's bedroom in the building as the pictures here show , these are the scenes which regularly affect life in @entity39 , @entity63 , where man and baboon share a sometimes uncomfortable existence			1
protected on the @entity68 since 1999 , there are now around 500 baboons living in 16 groups , increasingly cut off from their old , native habitats by the sprawling city			1
to survive , they trawl through waste bins , loiter at rubbish dumps , steal from shops and markets and prowl around the picnic sites			2
some are such practised scavengers that they know exactly when the rubbish carts will be arriving with fresh supplies at the dump			2
sweet tooth : a female baboon with young feeding on a discarded jar of peanut butter - the baboons trawl through waste bins and steal from shops and markets			1
some even know when the rubbish carts will be arriving with fresh supplies while some people do n’t give a monkey ’s about their vagrant neighbours even leaving out food for them , others go ape just at the thought of them			1
in the suburb of @entity102 , a woman screams at the pair of baboons sitting casually on the roof of her house munching hunks of pilfered brown bread			1
‘ no - one understands what is happening here ! this is the complete nightmare ’ , she yells , explaining that a baboon recently snatched shopping from her daughter ’s hands			1
‘ she is completely traumatised , ’ she adds			2
‘ it is not even safe to leave the house			2
and no - one does anything about it			1
’ a neighbour hurls a futile stick at them – but they carry on munching			2
‘ i hate them , ’ he says			0
not far away in @entity130 , employees at a safari company have just discovered what happens if you go away for the week - end and leave a window open			1
a group of baboons led by a male called @entity138 has left a trail of destruction in the staff kitchen			1
first target was the fridge where every packet has been opened , investigated and eaten			0
the menu runs to bread , pasta , cheese , peppers , eggs , carrots , tuna and corn			0
others preferred the contents of the rubbish bin			0
suffice to say , the animals did n’t bother to use the staff toilets			0
at the @entity161 vineyard , manager @entity159 laments the loss of vines and grapes he suffers every year because of the 40 resident baboons he is powerless to stop – except by paying for the whole estate to be fenced off			1
fight for life : a hungry baboon tries to steal vegetables from a shopper near the apartment block in @entity39 , @entity63 ‘ we are sitting on a time bomb			0
something has got to happen , ’ he says			0
‘ in the @entity176 they eat the young shoots , in summer the grapes			0
if the nature conservation authority would allow it , we would shoot them all			0
’ but many people admire the ingenuity of the baboons and are prepared to rub along with customers who never pay for anything			1
at a small supermarket between the settlements of @entity188 and @entity189 , a baboon called @entity191 calls in once or twice a week			0
‘ he goes directly to the fruit stand and takes a few kilos of bananas , ’ says the manageress			0
‘ then he runs past the check out to the shelves with the crisps			0
he seems to prefer cheese and onion			0
’ as she speaks , a baboon enters nonchalantly as if on cue , seizes a 5lb bag of apples and exits to a field next door where he proceeds to eat them , watched enviously by other members of the group			0
it is said that screaming hysterically at the baboons only makes things worse			1
‘ baboons infer from the fear and panic of people , that they themselves rank higher in the pecking order , ’ says animal behaviour expert @entity215 who studied the @entity39 colonies for 16 months			1
‘ and therefore they think are entitled to everything that these people have with them			1
one of the baboons found a nice blue blanket in somebody 's apartment - the owner forgot to shut the window ‘ the baboons have no intention of harming people			1
they just want to get high quality food in as short a time as possible			0
so , if you forget to close the door they will smell the food and go and get it			0
it saves energy by not having to walk miles and it also does n’t need to worry about being eaten by a leopard or a lion			0
’ the @entity39 now spends hundreds of thousands of pounds on schemes to monitor the baboons , including squads of rangers and a help hotline			1
although it is illegal to kill the animals , dozens are injured or killed each year – some in accidents , but others from brutal attacks from people who have caught them ransacking their property			2
others have been ‘ euthanised ’ by the authorities for the crime of being a persistent problem			0
@entity260 , who has earned herself the nickname @entity262 for her support of the animals through her charity @entity265 , says the authorities are over-reacting to the problem			0
‘ for hundreds of years baboons and humans have interacted here on the @entity68 , ’ she says			2
‘ photographs from the 1950s show smiling folk with baboons sitting on their vehicles , and letters describe picnics at the point – with baboon rascals stealing the sandwiches			2
what has changed from those scenarios ? – only our attitudes it seems			0
‘ now we live in fear of law suits , fear of safety and security – and we forget that aggression creates aggression , we forget that our attitude is the most important influence we can bring to bear			2
those who treat the baboons with respect and understanding , taking all necessary precautions to minimise interactions , seem to have few problems – but those who rage and shoot – well they do n’t really achieve too much at all , and certainly do n’t resolve any problems			1
’ another resident has just lost their pink curtains			0
the monkeys ripped the fabric from the rails above this open window			0

baboons swarm @entity10 style up the sides of blocks of flats , opening windows
for people , the weapons of choice is paintball guns and pepper sprays
' no - one understands what is happening ! this is a complete nightmare '
baboons infer from people 's fear that they rank higher in the pecking order
those who treat the baboons with respect seem to have few problems
