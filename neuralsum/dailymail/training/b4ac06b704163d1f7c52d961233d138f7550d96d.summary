by @entity0 published : 15:35 est , 11 september 2013 updated : 15:35 est , 11 september 2013 do you know someone inspirational ? the search for the 2013 winner is on the past year has been a whirlwind for @entity6			1
but ask her the best thing about becoming @entity9 2012 and she will tell you about one little girl			1
like many of the children @entity16 works with , the eight - year - old had lost both her parents and was living with her aunt			2
and , like too many adults in this difficult position , the girl 's aunt had long refused any official help and support			1
that was until the girl brought her aunt 's attention to an article in this newspaper about @entity16 and her ground - breaking charity @entity32 , which helps counsel families , and especially children , to cope with bereavement			1
@entity16 recalls : ' she was able to persuade her aunt to contact us and we have been helping them for several months			2
i 'm pleased to report they have come on in leaps and bounds			2
not only does the little girl leave our workshops with a smile on her face , her aunt has benefitted from being with others in a similar position			2
' if it had n’t been for the attention the @entity51 brought us , they would be suffering in silence , perhaps drowning in pent - up grief			2
' even better , this was just one of hundreds of families who contacted the charity after last year 's award			1
visits to @entity32 ’s website rose from 500 to 2,500 a month			2
they now have 30 counsellors , 100 volunteers , ten paid part - timers and this week gained their first paid full - time employee			2
in february , they moved to a new office in @entity68 , @entity69 , which has a drop - in centre			0
worthy winner : @entity6 is presented with her award by @entity73			1
she said the accolade has helped her charity reach even more people fundraising has rocketed , too - they made £ 100,000 more than usual last year , which @entity16 attributes to her @entity81 award			1
' the more people who hear our message , ' says @entity16 , 50 , ' the closer we get to my goal : a time when my charity is n't needed			1
' what we try to do , in essence , is to encourage people to talk about the death of a loved one , rather than attempt to bury the pain			1
' somewhere in @entity96 , a child loses a parent every 30 minutes			0
thousands more lose a sibling each year			0
@entity16 says children can be brushed aside when tragedy strikes : ' we adults mistakenly assume they do not feel or understand their loss as acutely as adults do			0
' she speaks from personal experience - she lost her mother to breast cancer when she was four			0
five years later , her father died of a heart attack			0
@entity16 explains : ' in those days people thought they were protecting me by not talking about it - each time it was days before i was even told of the death			1
understanding : at last year 's awards , @entity16 met @entity118 , who knows all about the support bereaved families need after losing son , @entity121 ' i found myself orphaned , adrift in a world that refused to discuss grief or let me in on the deaths that had changed my whole life			1
' @entity16 was adopted by her uncle and aunt and got ' three ready - made older brothers '			0
she went on to have a happy childhood , but the tragedy still haunted her			0
it was this which propelled her into the ' helping professions '			0
' getting the award was such a shock			1
suddenly , we had been given a badge of trust , credence ' while looking after her own four children - ranging in age from 16 to their late 20s - with businessman husband @entity144 , she trained as a psychotherapist			0
in 2003 , @entity16 published a book , also called @entity32 , to help families discuss death , and was deluged by requests for more guidance and support			1
she launched her charity in 2004 from her @entity69 home			1
over the years , she set up a helpline , an interactive website , arranged counselling , workshops , family remembrance days and residential camps			0
' we present a bereaved family with a menu of choices , ' she explains			0
' they can have one - to - one therapy sessions , join in group sessions or both			0
' the charity has attracted support from celebrities such as @entity172 presenter @entity171 , who lost her brother as a child , and singer @entity175 , whose father died when she was 15			1
@entity177 star @entity177 was also in contact before she died : ' we still care for her boys , and their dad @entity183 champions our cause			0
' support : the @entity186 , whose daughter @entity187 was murdered by @entity188 , are one of the many families @entity32 have helped but it was @entity191 and @entity186 , whose ten - year - old daughter @entity187 was murdered in @entity193 in 2002 by school caretaker @entity188 , who nominated @entity16 for our award			1
she says : ' they got to know us because i sent @entity191 my book			0
he has since said he wept tears of relief when we taught him it was ok to grieve for @entity187 for the rest of his life			0
' the @entity186 's son @entity206 was 12 when @entity187 was killed and they feared he would be left traumatised			1
the @entity186 's were one of the first families @entity16 helped , telling them it is fine to grieve and that they did n't need to pretend it had n't happened			1
@entity191 went on to become a patron of the charity			1
@entity16 says she did n't think ' for a moment ' that she 'd win the @entity215			0
last november , she met @entity118 at @entity216 with four other nominees before a star - studded ceremony hosted by the @entity51 at the @entity219 in @entity69 's @entity220			1
she says : ' we felt like film stars at the @entity223			0
i was impressed by how much time the prime minister 's wife spent with us			1
' @entity228 is a bridge without words : we did n't need to speak about specifics to know we understood each other			0
after all , she lost her own son [ @entity121 , who suffered from cerebral palsy and died aged six ] not so long ago			0
' at the ceremony , @entity236 's @entity235 announced @entity16 the winner			1
' it was such a shock , ' says @entity16			0
' suddenly , we had been given a badge of trust , credence			0
' following her award , people contacted the charity in droves , asking for help and volunteering			1
and in the past few months , the charity has secured grants from the @entity253 , @entity254 and @entity255			1
this has enabled them to launch a @entity259 service , allowing people to be counselled over the internet			1
but the most rewarding achievement of all ? ' @entity262 asked to speak at my children 's old primary school , ' she says			1
' children have so many questions , such as : " why wo n't mummy come back ? if @entity270 loved her so much , why wo n't he let her back ? " in need : @entity177 contacted the charity before her untimely death to ask them to support her two sons ' we are committed to speaking honestly about death - age appropriately , of course			1
' as for the children 's feedback , @entity16 says : ' sometimes it 's the way they look me in the eye , a shy smile when they leave or a little hand suddenly slipped into mine			2
these unspoken signs of gratitude are the best reward			0
' but she insists it 's not all doom and gloom - the charity helps children to have fun again after the death of a loved one			1
@entity16 says : ' it 's our job to show them it 's fine to play ; it is n't wrong for them to enjoy themselves			2
' @entity16 gives the example of a three - year - old girl called @entity311			0
' i just want to make sure today 's bereaved children do n't suffer the pain and confusion i did ' ' she was clinging to her mum , sobbing when i met her , ' she says			1
' she had lost her father			0
her mother felt she was a bad parent because she could n't heal her daughter 's pain			2
' thanks to @entity16 's reassurance - and the chance to meet others in a similar position - @entity311 's mother is better able to cope and @entity311 is happier			1
@entity16 stresses that the positive side of death is it teaches us to cherish every moment			0
' life is n't a dress rehearsal , ' she says , with infectious enthusiasm			0
' get out there and live every minute ! ' @entity16 has won several awards , but says the @entity51 's @entity335 is her most prized			1
' it is a clear milestone in my life , ' she says			0
' next stop ? the @entity339 ! i 'd love prince @entity340 on board			0
' next march , the charity celebrates its tenth anniversary			2
' it seems incredible for someone whose parents ' death taught her to fear the future , ' says @entity16			0
' when the worst happens to you when you ’re a child , you learn to dread what 's around the corner			2
@entity353 or @entity354 went away and never came back			0
now , in the light of our success , i can look forward with pride			0
' despite the sadness in her own childhood , this humblingly determined woman declares she 's the luckiest person in the world			2
' not only do i have a wonderfully close family , i get to help others every day , ' she explains			0
