come january there are many who begin the upward struggle to rid themselves of the extra pounds gained through holiday indulgence			0
these pictures show that it is not just humans who may have had a mince meant pie too many this @entity9 – one or two of these pets definitely need a diet			2
the odd treat is definitely well - earned for catching a ball or a piece of string , but these animals are definitely being killed with kindness as most appear barely able to move			1
right motivation : this heifer digs into his owners leftovers face first after somehow getting up on a chair to reach the table @entity9 indulgence : finally , after the fourth helping , @entity28 had enough turkey not the gym type : ' exercise ? sure , why not - i hear you bought new silk sheets ' unfortunately these pets are not the only ones in trouble			2
in the @entity40 it is estimated that 54 per cent of all dogs and cats are overweight or obese			1
a report from 2011 showed that 12 million @entity45 pets are overweight after being fed too many calorific treats , including takeaways , cheese , crisps and cakes , often on a daily basis			1
the study , by the veterinary charity pdsa , also showed that owners were unaware of the damage they were doing			2
starve me , if you dare : this porky pet - cat sits comfortably on his sofa - throne giving orders with his paw bring on the nuts : @entity63 and @entity65 's cousin , @entity66 waiter , bring me some pie : quite how this fat ginger tom intended to get back on his feet when the sun disappears is unclear safety first : ' sorry owner , there appears to be a seatbelt issue of the reach - around kind			0

over six million @entity45 dogs and five million cats are fed junkfood on regular basis and a nearly all owners - 90 per cent - admitted giving cheese , toast , crisps , biscuits , takeaways , cakes or other fatty treats as part of their diet			1
heavy - weight lifting : ' did you get hefty over @entity9 , owner ? not to worry , you can use me to exercise ' @entity104 : ' the transformation into my @entity107 costume has already begun , i 'm going as an orange ' talk about wobbles : this poor spaniel is literally too full to walk staying put : ' how lazy are you , just walk around me ! @entity112 , humans ' purrfect size : you know your pet has had too much to eat when it literally rolls over its own sides			0
