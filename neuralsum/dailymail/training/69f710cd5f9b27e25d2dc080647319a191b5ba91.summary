by @entity0 published : 19:58 est , 19 november 2013 @entity2 : 06:03 est , 20 november 2013 @entity3 has admitted she thinks @entity4 is ' crap tv ' and that women who watch it are ' silly ' it is the popular tv show that turned her into a household name and saw her go from philosophy student to baking star in a matter of weeks			1
but @entity3 has admitted she thinks @entity4 is ‘ crap tv ’ and that women who watch it are ‘ silly ’			1
it is a surprising revelation for the baker , 21 , who won an army of fans while @entity4 was on screens			1
and for a long time she was the odds - on favourite to win before being unexpectedly beaten by @entity24 in the final			2
then of course there was miss @entity3 ’s evident passion for the programme , which saw her break down in tears almost every episode out of apparent frustration at her under baked cakes or soggy bottoms			2
all of that , however , seemed to go out of the window on monday night as miss @entity3 joined a panel of women to debate whether feminism needs a rebranding			2
and she launched a startlingly scathing attack on the programme			0
she said : ‘ collectively we ’re [ women in general ] all a bit silly			2
i cried over the @entity52 @entity51 advert , we like get so excited when the @entity44 red cups come out			0
we watch crap on tv like @entity4			1
we like things we can latch onto and understand quite clearly			0
’ she added : ‘ this is n’t about dumbing down feminism or making it more girly or softer or diluting any of these messages			2
and i do n’t want you to compromise any of those goals			0
but i just think we need to change our meanings , make it more inclusive , make it less epidemic			0
’ it comes after @entity64 surprised fans of the popular programme , which recently announced its move from @entity68 to @entity68 1 , by branding herself a feminist as she hit back at accusations she had flirted with co-host , baker @entity72 , and sobbed her way into the final			1
and as she spoke at the east @entity76 debate , which was chaired by @entity78 editor - in - chief @entity77 , she addressed the ‘ unfortunate ’ stereotype that prevails about feminists as ‘ angry hairy women ’			1
she said : ‘ a lot of people were surprised i identified myself as a feminist			0
even though within academic feminism and journalism context , we assume feminism is the right way to go , i think we take for granted everyone feels that way			0
miss @entity3 surprised fans of the popular programme by branding herself a feminist ' everyone does n’t think that way			1
people still think that feminists are angry hairy women			0
that is a stereotype that prevails , unfortunately			0
’ as the final of @entity4 loomed earlier this year , fans appeared to turn on @entity99 and accused her of ‘ flirting ’ with baking judge @entity72 – something both @entity102 and @entity64 have both fiercely denied			1
viewers were also damningly critical of her tendency to burst into tears episode after episode			0
and true to form , as miss @entity24 was crowned bake off winner , miss @entity3 had a little sob and was later seen in a pub where she pledged to get ‘ absolutely trolleyed ’ and drown her sorrows .			1

@entity3 has admitted she thinks @entity4 is ‘ crap tv ’

the 21 - year - old won an army of fans while she was on the show
