by @entity0 published : 06:04 est , 14 may 2013 updated : 10:30 est , 14 may 2013 @entity2 ' oldest schoolboy rugby fixture has been suspended over teachers ' fears that the boys on one team had become so much bigger and better at the game than the others			1
the match between private schools @entity11 and @entity12 , @entity13 , has been called off for the first time in more than 130 years over worries the boys are now mismatched			1
this schools say a difference in emphasis between the schools - @entity18 excels at sport whereas @entity12 concentrates more on academia - means that the @entity18 boys have become bigger , stronger , and thus a danger to those from @entity12			1
@entity11 and @entity12 , @entity13 , have called off their historic rugby match over fears the @entity18 boys will hurt their smaller rivals			1
picture shows the @entity12 1st xv in 1965/66 the pupils at @entity12 , @entity13 , are concentrating less on rugby and more on a broader mix of sports and study @entity36 , headmaster at @entity11 , said : ' the pupils are devastated , but we are not shy about being outstanding at rugby ; we are enormously proud of our teams , and their pursuit of excellence is quite inspirational			1
' since the advent of the professional game in rugby , the two schools have taken different routes , and it has been increasingly difficult to ensure a safe and competitive game as a result			0
' it has therefore been decided by both schools that we should suspend the fixtures in senior rugby for the time being			0
' he added : ' both schools are committed to reviewing this decision regularly , and if the day comes when the fixture can once more be played in a way that is both competitive and safe , the match may become a part of the calendar once more			2
' the clash has historically been the centrepiece of the sporting calendar for both @entity67 schools			0
the first match in 1879 took place two years before the @entity70 was launched			0
@entity36 , left , head of @entity11 , said he was ' enormously proud ' of his pupils ' rugby abilities but recently @entity12 has paid less importance to the game , and turned pupils ' focus instead to other sports and academic achievement			1
this has led to a ' widening physical gulf ' between the two teams creating fears someone could soon be seriously injured			2
the gap between the two sides was highlighted in 2009 when 17 - stone juggernaut @entity86 appeared for @entity18 - just a year before his @entity2 international debut			2
other notable former @entity18 pupils include rugby stars @entity89 and @entity91			0
@entity18 has enjoyed a 15 - year unbeaten run in the fixture but the clash has maintained its popularity at both schools			1
@entity97 , head of @entity12 , said : ' @entity18 's rugby side is very big and very strong and we admire them for that			1
international rugby stars ' juggernaut ' @entity86 , left , and @entity89 , right , both went to @entity18 ' at @entity12 we go for wider range of sports with a real emphasis of academic provision at the core of what we do			2
sport is very important , including rugby , but with a slightly different emphasis than @entity18			0
' therefore our senior squad , on average , is generally made up of younger and less experienced players			0
' the decision to suspend the fixture is exactly that , a suspension , and i certainly do n't see it as the end of the story			0
' the rugby fixtures in younger age groups and fixtures at all levels in other sports will continue to be played			0
back in 1888/89 , the @entity12 1st xv was a good match for the team from @entity18 , but no longer			2

@entity11 and @entity12 , @entity13 , say teams are *unequal*
private welsh schools have suspended annual fixture over safety fears
@entity12 head says @entity18 boys are ' very big and very strong '
