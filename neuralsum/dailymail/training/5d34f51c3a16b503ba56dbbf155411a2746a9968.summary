by @entity0 the square where @entity3 's national crisis began has erupted into violence again as the few hundred remaining protesters clashed with riot police			1
black smoke billowed from burning tyres and activists threw stones in @entity12 's @entity11 today as officials tried to remove barricades which had remained since president @entity15 was ousted in february			1
the violence came as @entity17 warned @entity18 could be planning to invade the east of the country as it once again massed 20,000 troops on the border			1
armed riot police moved onto the square to fight club - waving protesters in combat clothes and masks			1
the riot police and workers eventually withdrew - leaving the situation unresolved in chaotic scenes			1
the square , known as the @entity63 after its name in @entity3 , was the focus of @entity28 protests which ignited @entity3 's political crisis at the end of last year			2
pro-moscow president @entity15 was overthrown and replaced by the more pro-european @entity71 , largely thanks to the violent protests			1
bloody : there were injuries between the self - defence activists ( pictured ) and government volunteers clashes : the eyes of the world had since shifted from @entity12 to @entity83 rebels in the east of @entity3 violence : at one point there were thousands of protesters in the square , but now only a few hundred remain historic : the square is in the centre of @entity12 and has been crucial to the country 's political crisis but that sparked the @entity97 feeling among pro-russians in eastern @entity3 , spiralling into a civil war and the takeover of cities like @entity102 and @entity103 by militants			0
many protesters , including self - defence militias , had taken down their tents and returned to their homes since @entity71 was elected in may			2
other barricades remained in place along with makeshift shrines to the 100 or so protesters killed by police sniper fire during the protests			1
a few hundred protesters are estimated to still be in the square , saying they wanted to ensure the new government kept its promises of reform			0
but @entity12 's new authorities said they wanted the city to go back to normal with traffic moving freely ahead of an expected parliamentary election at the end of october			0
anger : the clashes were sparked when city employees tried to clear remaining tents from the square @entity130 , a 43 - year - old businessman , complained : ' there are practically no normal people left ' makeshift : the barricades in @entity11 , known as @entity63 , have been up for several months improvised armour : an activist in a camouflage jacket , a cycle helmet and novelty lab goggles looks on they had already tried to negotiate with the stragglers but all attempts to forge a deal fell through			1
' it 's like seeing everything that went on in winter coming back : tyres are burning , the police are here and so are people with clubs , ' said @entity151 , a 37 - year - old @entity12 resident			2
' it 's not right - especially since the most decent people have gone off to fight in the war ( against separatists in the east )			0
civilised countries do n't behave like this '			0
one protester wearing a @entity3 cossack uniform , @entity161 , declared his resistance to attempts to take down the encampment			0
a group of young masked protesters stood nearby atop a truck , banging on the roof of the vehicle with clubs			0
' they tried to kill us today			0
they set fire to us , ' he said			0
explosives : an activist in the square throws a @entity180 cocktail today at a burning tyre barricade improvised : the protesters built up everything they could as their defences , including large outdoor bins battle : @entity12 's new authorities said they wanted the city to go back to normal with traffic moving freely chaos : just as the clashed happened in @entity12 , @entity18 was mounting troops along the eastern border but @entity130 , a 43 - year - old businessman , said : ' it 's the right thing to do			1
' i was here from the start of the @entity63 and i believe it 's right now to take down what there is here			0
there are practically no normal people left here			0
' hundreds of miles away in the east , fighting between @entity3 forces and @entity83 rebels has continued - leaving crash investigators unable to attend the scene of the @entity209 disaster			0
and @entity18 announced more military exercises near the border this week , prompting a warning from @entity17 that the @entity213 could be planning a ground invasion			1
@entity17 officials warned @entity216 had 20,000 troops near the border who could move into @entity3 under the pretext of launching a humanitarian mission			1
@entity221 has rallied @entity18 with relentless nationalist campaigns in state media against @entity3 and in support of the rebel cause , and @entity227 officials fear he might invade to prevent a rebel defeat			2
national crisis : an activist throws a stone today during the clashes in @entity12 's @entity11 shirtless : unlike during the bitter protests in winter , summer temperatures in @entity12 have hovered around @entity235 unprotected : most of the demonstrators had no body armour , despite throwing @entity180 cocktails			2
