by @entity0 published : 06:59 est , 9 november 2012 updated : 06:59 est , 9 november 2012 archaeologists from @entity2 say they have have stumbled onto a @entity4 murder mystery after two bodies were found dumped in a well dating back 8,500 years			1
researchers from the @entity7 unearthed the ancient well in the @entity9 , south - west of @entity10 , after it was discovered by road maintenance workers			1
but they have no idea how the skeletal remains of a 19 - year - old girl and an older man came to be dumped deep down the 26ft well , and suggest that it may be a case of murder			1
murder mystery : skull fragments from the remains of a teenage girl and an older who were found at the bottom of an 8,500 - year - old well unearthed by archaeologists in @entity2 ' what is clear is that after these unknown individuals fell into the well it was no longer used , ' said @entity28 , the archaeologist in charge of the dig. the ancient well was found by workers from the @entity2 @entity32 as they carried out preliminary work to enlarge a junction on the area 's @entity35			1
researchers believe the well was sunk by ancient farmers who used its waters for livestock and crops raised on the fertile surrounding plain			2
' the impressive well that was revealed was connected to an ancient farming settlement and it seems the inhabitants used it for their subsistence and living , ' dr @entity28 said			0
' the upper part of the well was built of stones and its lower part was hewn in the bedrock			0
two capstones , which narrowed the opening , were set in place at the top of the well			0
' he added that the well had been measured at about 26ft deep and 4ft wide			2
going down : a researcher prepares to climb down the well as it is excavated by archaeologists from the @entity7			0
they believe it was used by ancient farmers who tended the fertile fields of the area relics : aside from the skeletal remains , researchers discovered these deeply denticulated sickle blades knapped from flint which were used for harvesting , as well as arrow heads and stone implements the mysterious remains were not the only evidence of the well 's original users that the @entity7 team discovered			1
' numerous artefacts indicating the identity of the people who quarried it – the first farmers of the @entity9 – were recovered from inside the well , ' said dr @entity28			2
' the finds include , among other things , deeply denticulated sickle blades knapped from flint which were used for harvesting , as well as arrow heads and stone implements			1
' the excavation of the accumulations in the well shaft yielded animal bones , organic finds and charcoal which will enable future studies about the domestication of plants and animals , and also allow researchers to determine the exact age of the well by means of advanced methods of absolute dating ' he added : ' the well reflects the impressive quarrying ability of the site ’s ancient inhabitants and the extensive knowledge they possessed regarding the local hydrology and geology which enabled them to quarry the limestone bedrock down to the level of the water table			2
' no doubt the quarrying of the well was a community effort that lasted a long time			0
' lucky find : the well was unearthed by workers from the @entity2 's @entity128 company as they carried out preliminary work to expand a junction			1
it will new be conserved for exhibition to the public according to dr. @entity135 , head of the @entity136 of the @entity7 , such finds are rare in @entity2 - and indeed in the prehistoric world in general			1
' the two oldest wells in the world were previously exposed in @entity140 and they indicated the beginning of the domestication phenomenon , ' he said			0
' it seems that ancient man tried to devise ways of protecting his drinking water from potential contamination by the animals he raised , and therefore he enclosed the water in places that were not accessible to them			0
' the wells had another important advantage : quarrying them provided access to an available source of water that was not dependent upon springs or streams			0
' another well , which is about 1,000 years later than those in @entity140 , was previously exposed at the @entity164 site in @entity2 , and another well from this period has now been exposed at the ‘ @entity167 ’ site			1
' the exposure of these wells makes an important contribution to the study of man ’s culture and economy in a period when pottery vessels and metallic objects had still not yet been invented ”			0
the @entity7 and @entity32 will act to conserve the well and exhibit it as part of the sites around @entity180 in the different periods .			0

the 26ft - deep well in @entity2 's @entity9 dates back 8,500 years
it was discovered by road maintenance workers on the *job*
other finds include flint sickle blades , arrow heads and stone implements
