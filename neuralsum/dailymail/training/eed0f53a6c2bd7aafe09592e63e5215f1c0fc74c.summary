young men suspected of falling for the warped ideology of @entity3 are being arrested at a rate of almost one a day , it has emerged			1
@entity6 assistant commissioner @entity5 said @entity3 is unlike any other threat @entity8 has faced before in its bid to recruit and corrupt people			1
the national policing lead for counter-terrorism said arrests were up 35 per cent as extremists try to radicalise ' misfits , criminals and the vulnerable '			1
@entity6 assistant commissioner @entity5 said officers were now making arrests almost every day to pick up extremists trying to radicalise ' misfits , criminals and the vulnerable ' armed police patrols have been stepped up in the wake of the @entity22 terror attacks , while @entity6 has issued a public plea for more money to deal with the mountains of electronic evidence involved in terror cases			1
ministers urged the public to be ‘ vigilant ’ and warned @entity8 is at ' very significant risk ' from a terror attack by extremists			1
mr @entity5 said the threat posed by @entity3 extremists , including those returning to the @entity8 after fighting in @entity35 and @entity36 , had led to a sharp rise in police activity			1
he told @entity41 's @entity40 show : ' it 's very different			2
we 're making 35 per cent more arrests now than we used to in counter-terrorism			2
it 's nearly one arrest a day			1
' that comes out of the fact that we 're not just dealing with a classic terrorist organisation organising plots across the world			0
' we 're dealing with a group that 's trying to create what you might call a corrupt cult of people , of followers who will act in their name			2
' they 're trying to attract misfits , criminals and the vulnerable ; and it 's those people , not part of a bigger organisation , who may act of their own volition			1
that 's the challenge for us – is to have good sight of them and be able to intervene with them			0
' in the wake of the terror attacks in @entity22 last month , armed police were deployed to sites across @entity75 including @entity77 station he confirmed that emergency plans to cope with a terror attack in the @entity8 have been changed in the wake of the @entity22 shootings because it was ' not everything we anticipated '			1
around 600 people are believed to have travelled to @entity36 and @entity35 from the @entity8 since the conflict began and around half have returned home			2
asked about the anti-terror unit 's reaction to the @entity22 attacks , mr @entity5 said : ' in terms of our national firearms capability , we 've asked is it strong enough ? how 's it placed ? how 's it organised ? ' we 've arranged to be able to deal with those sorts of events and we have some well - tested exercises and command and control regimes for working across the country on counter-terrorism			1
' but you look at an event like @entity22 and you think not everything in that we anticipated , so we 're going to have to make some refinements to our plans to improve			2
' he also shared prince @entity113 's fears of how young people in the @entity8 are being radicalised in their own communities			1
the prince 's comments on @entity118 and @entity119 were broadcast in an interview with @entity122 's @entity121 with @entity123 this morning the @entity113 said it is a ' great worry ' that so many young @entity8 who are yearning for adventure and excitement are being radicalised by ' crazy stuff ' online voiced fears about the ' alarming ' extent to which young people are being radicalised			1
mr @entity5 said : ' that 's the dynamic that worries us most of us all , is the ability of @entity134 to reach in to communities			1
' we 've been making lots of appeals to communities over the past year asking them for increasing amounts of help and we 've seen that , we 've seen more information coming forward			0
' the police have recently strengthened their cyber resources , leading to 1,000 ' unsavoury ' posts a week being taken down			0
however , mr @entity5 said more money is needed to grow the anti-terror unit over the next year and discussions with the government for funding are ongoing			2
' we certainly need more money and that ’s what we ’re discussing with government at the moment , ' he said			0

you can do this by remaining vigilant and reporting any suspicious activity to the police			0
’ it sets out six types of suspicious activity to report to police , including : someone noticeable behaving differently for no obvious reason someone with a large number of mobile phones for no obvious reason someone with passports or other documents in different names for no obvious reason someone who travels for long periods of time but is vague about where they ’re going someone buying or storing large amounts of chemicals for no obvious reason someone taking an interest in security , like cctv cameras , for no obvious reason the direct appeal to the public follows an increased police presence in central @entity75			0
