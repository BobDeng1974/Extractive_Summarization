' @entity78 gov. @entity77 said that she and other governors are trying not to ' get distracted by all this noise			0
' last year : @entity6 dined next to @entity152 @entity45 , but this year he skipped the event completely leaving many wondering why this year : @entity156 first lady @entity45 and others raise their glasses for a toast with no @entity6 in sight next week @entity6 is scheduled to lead his second @entity13 town hall - style meeting in as many weeks			1
