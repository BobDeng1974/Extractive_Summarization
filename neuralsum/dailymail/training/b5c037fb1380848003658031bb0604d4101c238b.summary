in a brazen protest , the employee parked a car out the front of the company 's headquarters in @entity19 , @entity12 , with letters stuck on its windows on behalf of the ' journalists , photographers and artists ' of the company , criticising pay and conditions			1
it also questions recent financial decisions made at the company 's headquarters , including a new $ 60 million publishing system that many employees either do n't know how or refuse to use more than a year after its implementation			0
the notes attack the company 's managers by claiming they are imposing ' a pay cut in real terms ' that will hurt staff and force them to give up ' various allowances and conditions '			1

mr @entity73 once worked as a journalist at the @entity7			0
but while the 50th birthday bash is expected to attract a host of dignitaries - including mr @entity73 - the party was clearly the last thing on the mind of the disgruntled staffer who parked the protest car in front of the @entity2 building			1
the car which was parked outside the @entity2 headquarters , and seen by @entity89 at 7.30am on monday another letter posted on the rear of the vehicle claims the journalist can not afford to upgrade their ageing vehicle			2

' an open letter to @entity3 on the eve of the 50th anniversary of the @entity7 ' ' as a passionate and committed journalist yourself , you know that the success of the @entity7 and other @entity2 titles lies in the quality of the journalism			2
so , we humbly ask you , as the people who do that journalism , to suggest to your managers here that they spare a thought for us , the very hardworking journalists , photographers , and artists at @entity2 your managers are insisting on imposing on us a pay cut in real terms , and that we give up various allowances and conditions			1
please ask your managers to ask themselves : do we really deserve that ? many thanks , the journalists , artists and @entity142 '			0
