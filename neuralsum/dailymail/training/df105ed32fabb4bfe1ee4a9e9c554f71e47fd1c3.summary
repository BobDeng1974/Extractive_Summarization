by @entity0 vital new evidence : police claim that @entity3 attacked @entity4 with the cricket bat @entity7 sprinter @entity3 crushed his girlfriend ’s skull with a cricket bat before shooting her dead , police have told her family			1
details of the post-mortem examination of @entity16 model @entity15 were withheld from last week ’s bail application hearing			1
but grieving relatives who saw her body before tuesday ’s cremation in @entity22 described horrific injuries from the cricket bat , and entry wounds from 9mm bullets fired by @entity3			1
they were also briefed about the model ’s death by police and lawyers from the state prosecutor ’s office			2
in a sworn affidavit read to the bail hearing in @entity35 magistrates ’ court last week , @entity3 claimed that he used the bat to break down the toilet door after the shooting , saying he had not realised his girlfriend was in the bathroom			1
the bloodstained bat , which is currently being examined by a police forensics team , will be key evidence when @entity3 goes on trial for premeditated murder			1
the ‘ @entity3 ’ – who has previously boasted about having a cricket bat , pistol and machine gun at home to defend himself against intruders – claims the bat became blood - spattered at the scene			1
last week the prosecution did not mention any details about the bat and the role they believe it played in @entity4 ’s death , opting not to disclose their case against @entity3			1
but to secure bail , @entity3 ’s legal team had to detail his defence , which included why he had a blood - spattered cricket bat in his possession on the fatal night			1
the athlete claims that during the night he heard a noise in the bathroom and feared it was an intruder			2
@entity3 , 26 , said he felt ‘ vulnerable ’ without his prosthetic legs , so he got a gun from under his bed and fired through the bathroom door , shouting at the ‘ intruder ’ to get out of the house and for @entity4 to call the police			1
at that point @entity3 thought she was still in bed			1
@entity3 described his ‘ horror and fear ’ as he realised @entity4 was not in the bed , and said he used the bat to break down the toilet door to find @entity4 slumped inside the cubicle			1
he said he called paramedics and then carried @entity4 , 29 , downstairs , trying to revive her , but she died in his arms			2
yesterday , @entity4 ’s father @entity91 said that the athlete would have to ‘ live with his conscience ’ if he is lying about how he killed her			2
paralympian @entity3 is at home after being granted bail following a gruelling four - day hearing he told @entity102 - language newspaper @entity101 : ‘ it does n’t matter how much money he has and how good his team of lawyers is , he must be able to live with his conscience if he allows his team of lawyers to lie on his behalf			1
‘ he will have to live with his conscience			2
but if he speaks the truth , i can perhaps someday forgive him			2
if it does not happen as he tells it , he must suffer			2
’ in another interview , @entity4 ’s mother june said : ‘ everything has been taken away from me in such a terrible way			0
the only thing that matters now is the truth			0
’ @entity15 's father , @entity91 , said @entity3 ' will have to live with his conscience ' if he turns out to be lying about her death @entity3 ’s family believe him to be innocent , with his father @entity119 saying he had ‘ zero doubt ’ that @entity4 ’s death was a tragic accident			1
in an earlier interview , @entity119 said : ‘ when you are a sportsman , you act even more on instinct			0
it ’s instinct , things happen and that ’s what you do			0
‘ when you wake up in the middle of the night , and crime is so endemic in @entity16 , what do you do if somebody is in the house ? do you think it ’s one of your family ? no , of course you do n’t			1
’ in a statement yesterday @entity3 ’s family said : ‘ @entity3 will never be the same			1
having to live with the knowledge he caused the death of the woman he loved , and that he can never undo the immense pain and loss this has caused @entity4 ’s family and friends			0
’ having been released from bail after the gruelling four - day hearing , @entity3 was yesterday spending the day with his family at a secret address in @entity35 provided by his legal team			1
his uncle @entity155 said : ‘ we are convinced @entity3 ’s version of what happened that terrible night will prove to be true			1
’ today , if his athletics coach @entity3 has his way , @entity3 could be back in training at the track at the @entity162			1
he was last there earlier this month with @entity4 , who watched admiringly as he was put through his paces			0
friends have spoken of the need for a suicide watch on the sportsman as he spends the next four months preparing for his court appearance on june 4			0
meanwhile , @entity16 ’s top detective lieutenant general @entity170 is taking over the role of chief investigator in the case , after @entity174 stepped down from the post			1
detective @entity174 resigned after seven charges of attempted murder against him were reinstated			0
he and three other officers shot at a minibus of escaping murder suspects in 2009			0
by @entity181 , celebrity lawyer who successfully defended @entity182 lawyer @entity181 says @entity3 may have won bail at the risk of compromising his future freedom this weekend , @entity3 is walking free in @entity16			1
the prospect of being caged in prison has receded , at least for the moment			0
beyond his sporting prowess , @entity3 has been a national hero , an inspirational role model , and , above all , a global celebrity			1
yet that could prove his downfall , as @entity3 , like so many celebrities , is focused on living for the moment			1
by securing his freedom today , he may have taken a huge gamble with his future liberty			0
it is , perhaps , the fatal flaw of a celebrity in the legal cross-hairs : a fixation on the immediate repair of their tarnished image , rather than a long - term strategy best suited to their ultimate freedom			0
i have represented dozens of celebrities in the @entity212 – professional athletes , film stars , mega-wealthy tycoons , musicians and political figures			0
people ask me all the time : does being a celebrity help or hurt the case ? well , sometimes it helps , sometimes it hurts , but it is never irrelevant			0
representing a celebrity poses distinct challenges to a lawyer			0
celebrities often care more about today than tomorrow			0
they are concerned about the immediate impact of the case on their @entity231 ’s image is worth millions of dollars and every day that passes reduces that value			0
i am certain that he instructed his lawyers to get him out on bail now , even if that meant compromising his longer - term chances of freedom			2
the best proof of that is the unusual affidavit he signed , laying out his defence in some detail			0
he was not required to do that , but i ’m certain his lawyer told him that he would increase his chances of getting bail if he put forward a plausible defence			1
however , there are great risks in submitting an affidavit before all the forensic evidence is in			2
scientific evaluation of the crime scene may show inconsistencies with the defence proffered in the affidavit			0
that would hurt @entity3 further down the line			2
@entity181 said the @entity3 legal team went into unusual detail in his affadavit in a bid to win bail when a celebrity is placed on trial , the legal system often becomes distorted			1
this is true even in a country such as @entity16 , which does not have trial by jury			2
professional judges , though they often deny it , are also influenced by their perception of the defendant , which they have garnered not from the evidence , but from the media and from watching the celebrity perform			2
judges go out of their way to pronounce from the bench that they will not be influenced by the defendant ’s notoriety			0
methinks they protest too much			0
when i represent a celebrity , i base my actions on the belief that celebrity matters			0
@entity3 is not only a celebrity , he is a beloved son of @entity16 ; a man who overcame significant handicaps ; a hero			1
celebrities ’ lawyers are often too anxious to please their clients and sometimes sacrifice professionalism in the interests of not being fired			0
i ’m not suggesting that filing the affidavit in @entity3 ’s case was an example of this , but i am saying that the defence lawyer should have been darn sure that his client was telling him the truth before he allowed him to lock in his story so early			2
most lawyers would not have submitted such an affidavit			0
but the defence attorney knows more than i what is in the public record and may have made the right decision			0
in granting @entity3 bail , the judge drew attention to the affidavit – so the trial lawyer ’s tactic worked in the short term			1
only time will tell whether it will work in the long term			0
