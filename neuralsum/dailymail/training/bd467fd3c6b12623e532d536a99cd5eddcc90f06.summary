by @entity0 a grass snake had to be rescued by a vet when it got stuck trying to squeeze through a drain with a frog in its throat			1
the two - foot long snake was carried to @entity7 in @entity8 - still stuck in the metal grid - after a man spotted the reptile trapped in the grating in his garden			1
it had just swallowed a frog which added a couple of inches to its girth			1
the two - foot snake decided against swallowing the frog and regurgitated it shortly after being freed			1
it was then released back into the garden where it was found			0
mr @entity29 said : ' a gentleman found the snake stuck in a drain in his garden and brought it into us			1
surgeon @entity29 from @entity7 in @entity8 rescued the snake with some lubricant ' it had become completely stuck			1
it was clear it had eaten something as it had an extra couple of inches around it 's girth			2
' i thought i was going to have to soar off the grate but after using lots of lubricant , i managed to free it within around 10 minutes			0
' he added : ' it was absolutely fine but regurgitated the frog soon after			2
' the gentleman then took the snake home and released it back into his garden			2
' measuring up to 6ft long grass snakes are the largest species of snake in @entity71 , but unlike adders they are not venomous			0
they pose no threat to humans but they are dangerous to the small animals on which they feast because of their speed and quick reflexes			0
as the only species of snake in @entity71 to lay eggs , they have jaws big enough to regularly swallow small animals whole			0
but they are preyed on too , and play dead when cornered by predators			0
the snakes subsist mainly on amphibious animals like frogs , toads and newts , as well as the occasional fish .			0
