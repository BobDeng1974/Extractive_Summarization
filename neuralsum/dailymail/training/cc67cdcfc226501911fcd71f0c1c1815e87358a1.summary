by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 20:36 est , 5 january 2013 updated : 21:06 est , 5 january 2013 a tycoon accused of hiding a multi-million - pound fortune from his former wife in an acrimonious divorce battle has been sentenced to two years in jail			1
lawyers say the prison term , the longest of its kind , will serve as a stark warning to husbands who defy the courts in an effort to stop their ex-partners sharing their riches			1
the man at the centre of the case is @entity20 , a 67 - year - old cigar - chomping former boss at the @entity22			1
he was nicknamed @entity23 by colleagues for his role in closing @entity22 ’s @entity27 factory in 2002			0
tycoon : @entity20 , pictured with his third wife @entity29 , was sentenced to two years in jail for hiding his fortune during a divorce row his fearsome reputation for cost - cutting helped him earn a salary of up to £ 1.2 million a year and a jet - set lifestyle which included the use of a string of luxury properties in exotic locations around the world			1
but he is now a wanted man after a high court judge sentenced him in his absence to two years ’ jail for ‘ a continuing failure ’ to disclose his alleged hidden wealth in a case which his ex-wife of 27 years brought against him			1
last night mr @entity20 ’s ex-wife @entity49 , 61 , a @entity50 - born dental surgeon , blamed the break - up of the marriage on her husband ’s interest in @entity55 , 40 , whom he married after their divorce settlement was finalised in 2005			1
speaking from her home in @entity59 , @entity60 , she said : ‘ i ’d moved all over the world with @entity20 and i ’d given up my profession for him			1
it was like i ’d passed my expiration date and he was trading me in for a younger model			0
’ the @entity66 met when he was a plant manager with @entity68 in the @entity69 in the @entity70			2
the couple married in @entity72 and during his career he landed top jobs in @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 and the @entity79			0
@entity80 , 61 , blamed her marriage break - up on her husband 's interest in @entity55 , 40 mrs @entity80 filed for divorce in the @entity79 while her husband was based at @entity22 ’s @entity87 headquarters			0
in 2005 she agreed a cash settlement of £ 1.1 million and their heavily mortgaged mansion in a @entity87 suburb			0
mr @entity20 was awarded a grand property named @entity93 in @entity94 , which he has since sold for £ 1.6 million			2
after the settlement @entity95 hired private detectives and a forensic accountant to track her husband ’s alleged wealth to a bank account in @entity102 and a family trust fund which , allegedly , is being used to control his fortune for the benefit of his third and latest wife			2
in 2011 , mrs @entity80 took her case to the @entity108 where she successfully obtained a freezing order against her husband – to stop him disposing of his property or money			2
she was entitled to sue in this country because the @entity108 agreed there was sufficient relationship between mr @entity20 and his assets and @entity50 jurisdiction			2
mr @entity20 was deemed to have breached the high court judge ’s order to disclose details of his alleged wealth			1
in the legal proceedings it was claimed that he had recently been given £ 3.5 million in payments from one of his former employers , @entity126 , a @entity128 private equity firm			0
mrs @entity80 ’s investigators said that he also bought a £ 1.5 million property in an exclusive @entity132 harbour - front development called the @entity133 – where scenes from the @entity136 movie @entity137 were filmed			0
but mr @entity20 told the court he was now ‘ virtually penniless ’ and said the £ 31,000 cost of his third wedding and £ 118,000 in school and university fees for the daughter he had with @entity49 had contributed to his fall from riches to rags			1
he also claimed the running costs of the property in the @entity132 between 2005 and 2010 were £ 200,000			0
asset : the house in @entity94 the tycoon kept in the settlement according to the @entity108 judgment , when he was asked in 2009 by a @entity60 court about reasons for ‘ strange dealings ’ with a £ 2.5 million loan deposited into a @entity102 bank account , he said : ‘ because i did not want to be encumbered by you people and constrained on what i do with any of the money that i earned or borrowed			2
it becomes tiresome when you meddle in my affairs			0
’ high court judge @entity166 ruled that mr @entity20 ‘ deliberately refused to say what had happened ’ to the £ 3.5 million from @entity126			1
the judge added that ‘ millions of dollars appears to have vanished			0
i am satisfied that the husband is deliberately refusing to reveal what happened to it			0
’ ruling that mr @entity20 was in contempt of court , the judge said he was imposing a punitive sentence ‘ as a coercive measure in order to encourage full and prompt compliance hereafter ’			1
last night @entity178 , a family law expert at international law firm @entity179 , said : ‘ this judgment undoubtedly will send shivers up the spine of husbands and wives whose strategy is to hide assets			0
