@entity2 ' digests ' organic matter and then excretes the waste as sludge - it 's the first robot designed to eat and get rid of waste just like a human they have made robots that talk , walk and speak like humans			1
now researchers have taken another leap forward in android technology - with a robot that eat just like a human and , just like a human , has to visit the toilet			0
the team created a robot which uses organic matter for fuel , then ' excretes ' the waste			1
they claim it could be the first step on the way to a new generation of ‘ eco bots ’ that may even need their own toilets - or share those humans do			1
another theory is that they could actually be toilets themselves , and use human waste for power			2
such a scenario has until now been the stuff of science fiction - the time - travelling @entity38 in @entity39 was famously powered by waste food			0
the discovery was made by the @entity42 , part of the @entity44 in the @entity45			0
the first prototype had a microbe - powered fuel cell that ran off e. coli bacteria which fed off refined sugar			2
the second model tried using sludge microbes to break down rotten @entity52 of these had a hitch , however , that they had no way of getting rid of their waste , meaning they became poisoned			1
step forward prototype three , dubbed ‘ @entity2 ’ which @entity42 roboticist @entity60 said ‘ collects its own food and water from the environment ’			1
@entity2 ca n't find itself a sandwich , of course - it picks up its sugary food from a track within its @entity69 laboratory			2
he said : ‘ it performs the task we design it to do , and at the end of the day , it gets rid of its own waste			0
it literally craps into its own ' litter ' tray			2
’ robot with cakes and biscuits : ¿ @entity79 can find its own food			0
@entity81 said the machine ¿ collects its own food and water from the environment ' @entity86 , a microbiologist at the @entity42 added : ‘ robots that eat biological fuels could find enough fuel almost anywhere			0
‘ there is organic matter anywhere on earth - leaves and soil in the forest , or even human waste such as urine and feces			1
’ the researchers have already received enquiries from the @entity102 and @entity103 which could put them on missions to @entity105 to keep astronauts company .			0

@entity2 digests organic matter and visits a litter tray
digests sugar using sludge microbes
first of a generation of robots that need toilets ?
