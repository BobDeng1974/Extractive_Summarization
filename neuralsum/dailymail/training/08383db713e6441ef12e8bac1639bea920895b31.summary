by @entity0 and @entity1 this breathtaking footage of two wingsuit divers leaping from the top of a 4,600ft high mountain will blow you away			1
eager for the ultimate adrenalin rush , the daring duo decided to jump from the top of the @entity11 in @entity12 , despite the extreme sport being banned at the risky location			1
captured using a @entity17 camera , the footage shows the pair soaring alongside a four mile long cable line - the longest in the world			1
reaching speeds of over 160mph , the wing - suiters were forced to make split second life or death decisions			0
mr @entity26 said : ' the view was just amazing , it was great to see the tourist buses driving around the curves of the road			0
he said : ' there is an aerial lift which you can take to get the top of the @entity11 , we were aiming to fly as close the cable carts as possible			2
' because of the high and speed of the initial jump , it was incredibly difficult to line up with the cable carts			0
' but on the second jump we got really close , i 'd say we were about five metres away			0
' we found out that jumps from this area are banned two days before our trip but it was too late to cancel so we knew we just had to go and try , we were constantly worried that someone would stop us from jumping			2
' it was an incredible experience and even though it looks amazing on camera , it really does n't do it justice			0
' the special wingsuits allow daredevils to ' fly ' further than they would if they were using a parachute , but once they approach the ground they pull the cord to land on the way down the pair flew past the world 's longest cable car which travels for an astonishing four miles from the mountain top to the valley floor at one stage , the pair were just 10 metres away from the cable car , giving stunned @entity12 tourists an unexpected photo opportunity the wingsuit divers also buzzed cars and coaches driving on the mountain road while hurtling along the valley at speeds of up to 160 miles per hour on the way down , the pair had to dodge high peaks jutting up from the valley floor which could have caused disaster the pair performed two jumps even though they discovered two days beforehand that such activities had been banned mr @entity26 said ' it was an incredible experience and even though it looks amazing on camera , it really does n't do it justice '			1

@entity23 daredevils reached 160 miles - per - hour after they jumped off the mountain and ' flew ' through the valley
stunned @entity12 tourists looked on as the pair shot past a cable car *ferrying* *passengers* to the mountain top
the pair discovered that wingsuit diving was banned two days before their attempt , but carried on regardless
