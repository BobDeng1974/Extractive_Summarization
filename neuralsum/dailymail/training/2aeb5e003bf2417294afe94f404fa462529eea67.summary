the right of people from across @entity2 could be curtailed under @entity4 's plans to overhaul @entity6 's relationship with @entity7			2
the prime minister has drawn up a ' battleplan ' for talks with other @entity12 countries in which he wants to claw back powers over who can move to @entity6 , find work and claim benefits			1
mr @entity4 is already under pressure to urged to slash benefits and access to public services for immigrants from @entity2 , but @entity23 suggested he could go further			1
pressure : prime minister @entity4 is ready to look at freedom of movement rules which allow anyone from in the @entity12 to settle in @entity6 mr @entity4 will use a meeting of @entity2 leaders next week to step up pressure for reform , demanding major cuts to red tape which threaten competitiveness			1
but the government is under pressure to do more to tackle the ' pull factors ' which draw thousands of people to @entity6 every year			0
a new study reveals a sharp rise in the number of @entity12 migrants without a job living in @entity6 to more than 600,000 – the equivalent of a city the size of @entity45			1
there was a 73 per cent increase in the number of ‘ job - seeking ’ @entity12 immigrants in the country in the three years to 2011 , according to the @entity51			1
asked if the government was now examining ways to curb the freedom of movement rules - allowing people from anywhere in the @entity12 to settle in @entity6 - @entity23 confirmed it was on the table			2
mr @entity4 's official spokesman said : ' i think it is understandable that in the @entity6 and a number of other countries , questions are being asked in this area			2
' we have a programme underway , bilateral discussions with other member states			0
it is not right to pre-empt that now			0
' work and pensions secretary @entity73 is already working with other member states on plans to toughen the habitual residence test to make it harder for immigrants to claim benefits			2
mr @entity4 ’s spokesman added : ‘ the government ’s view clearly is changes do need to be made in this area and actually the fact that we are co-operating and working in partnership with a good number of other member states i think is significant			2
’ he added that there are ‘ widespread concerns ’ across @entity2 about access to state benefits and public servants of migrants			2
‘ we do n’t think that the current system is working in the right way			0
by definition we are seeking to take action on these pull factors			0
‘ there is an issue here fundamentally with regard to access to the welfare system and others around fairness			0
’ @entity51 figures show there has been a 73 per cent increase in ' job - seeking ' @entity12 immigrants meanwhile , a poll has found that two - thirds of the public want ministers to take ‘ drastic action ’ to cut immigration			1
@entity119 mayor @entity118 said migrants should have to work for ‘ quite a long time ’ before they can claim any benefits in this country			1
the @entity119 mayor said it was wrong that ‘ we have no control over the time lapse between arrival in this country to work and the ability to withdraw benefits ’			2
and he suggested the prime minister should press for a change in the law as part of his renegotiation of @entity6 ’s relationship with the @entity12			1
‘ that is something that could be considered by the government for the renegotiation of the @entity142 that is about to come up , ’ he said			0
@entity144 mp @entity143 also called for a clampdown , saying that migrants appeared to be fleeing to @entity6 to escape the eurozone crisis			0
@entity118 said migrants should have to work for ' quite a long time ' before claiming benefits in the @entity6 ‘ we can not both continue the free - at - the - point - of - use welfare state and benefits system and allow @entity2 to flee the eurozone and come here , ’ the @entity151 mp added			1
the @entity51 study , published today , reveals that in 2012 there were 611,779 economically ‘ non-active ’ @entity12 migrants living in @entity6 – up from 431,687 six years ago			1
the annual cost to the @entity161 of treating ‘ non-active ’ migrants is estimated at £ 1.5billion			0

‘ between 2006 and 2012 there has been a steady increase of 42 per cent in the number of non-active @entity12 migrants in the @entity6 , ’ it says			2
‘ a particularly high increase can be noticed between 2009 and 2011			0
the number of job - seeking @entity12 migrants increased by 73 per cent , while the total @entity12 migrant population increased by only 28 per cent			1
’ the report was commissioned by @entity180 , the @entity51 ’s employment commissioner , who is suing @entity6 over rules that mean some benefits are not immediately available to @entity12 migrants			1
a @entity51 spokesman said it was ‘ ridiculous ’ to suggest the report ’s findings meant there are 600,000 unemployed migrants , because the figure includes older children , students , pensioners and other economically inactive adults			2
‘ all existing studies without any exceptions say that @entity12 migrants are more likely to be in work than the native population and make a positive contribution to the @entity199 , ’ he added			1
despite the evidence it uncovers , the report concludes that the impact of ‘ non-active ’ immigrants on the benefits system is ‘ very low ’			0
sixty - seven per cent of @entity6 said they want @entity4 to take ' drastic action ' to cut immigration ( file picture ) 611,779 : the number of ' non-active ' @entity12 migrants in @entity6 - up 42 per cent in six years £ 1.5bn : estimated annual cost to @entity161 of treating ' non-active ' migrants 73 % increase in the number of ' job seeking ' @entity12 migrants in @entity6 between 2009 and 2011 3.7m : increase in the population of @entity218 and @entity219 between 2001 and 2011 , of which 2.1million attributed to immigration £ 2bn : potential cost of @entity12 bid to end curbs on migrants claiming benefits 67 % of public want ' drastic action ' to cut immigration 52 % of voters say they are more likely to back party promising to cut immigration ' significantly ' but @entity231 , of the think - tank @entity232 , said the conclusion was ‘ misleading … wilfully or otherwise ’			1
a poll carried out for @entity236 by @entity237 suggests the public want ministers to take a much tougher stance on immigration			0

seventy - four per cent said they were concerned that @entity246 and @entity247 will be allowed unfettered access to @entity6 from the end of this year			0
@entity6 uses the @entity250 to establish whether @entity12 migrants are eligible for benefits			1
to qualify for jobseekers ’ allowance , employment support allowance , pension credit and income support they must demonstrate they have either worked here previously or have a good chance of getting a job			0
last night the @entity261 said it was determined to tighten the test to limit migrants ’ access to benefits			0
but the @entity51 says this ‘ right to reside ’ test indirectly discriminates against nationals from other @entity12 states by enforcing a set of conditions that effectively tests their right to state handouts			1
the test is being challenged in court by mr @entity180 , despite warnings from work and pensions secretary @entity73 that the existing rules save @entity6 up to £ 2billion a year			0
mr @entity73 pledged last year to toughen up the test to curb ‘ benefit tourism ’			0
a @entity261 spokesman said : ‘ we have strict rules in place to protect the integrity of the @entity6 benefits system and make sure it is not abused			0

‘ ministers are also working with their counterparts across @entity2 to address concerns about the abuse of free movement			0
