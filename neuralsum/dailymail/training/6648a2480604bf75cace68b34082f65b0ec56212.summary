details of the claims emerged in papers submitted to the @entity22 , where it was claimed that the @entity3 ’ white counterparts were not subjected to the same rules			0
managers at the @entity12 in @entity13 are accused of demanding gifts from @entity3 staff who wanted time off work the workers , and their union the @entity40 , claim that the staff had been subject to the practice from as early as 2007			1
they also claim they were exposed to a culture of intimidation and fear by supervisors , and were victimised and faced ' harassment ' when they tried to join a union			0
@entity26 - which runs some of the non-medical services of the hospital - strongly denies the practice amounted to racial discrimination and said the main manager responsible no longer worked for the company			1
@entity56 , a claimant in the group action and a @entity40 rep for the workers , said : ' we are in a developed country and had to give money and gold for holidays			0
' most of the staff were recruited in @entity67 to work for @entity26 as porters , cleaners , and members of the housekeeping staff in @entity13 ’s biggest hospital			1
supervisors implemented a system where they expected gifts in return for favours , but , according to the claim , their demands were only made to non-white employees			1
@entity26 ( pictured ) has denied that the practice amounted to racial discrimination and said the main manager responsible no longer worked for the company @entity85 , a union representative , claimed that when he applied for a porter ’s job , he was asked what he would give a female manager in return			1

it is then alleged that mr @entity85 , accompanied by a friend , handed over a chain , belonging to his wife at the manager ’s house			0

the papers also claim @entity26 carried out an investigation and the claimant cleaners were interviewed and told that their evidence was confidential			2
accusations : the cleaners were employed by contractor @entity26 however , in june , the company told the workers they would face a disciplinary hearing because they had given gifts in return for benefits , the papers allege			1

the company stated it would vigorously defend itself against the claims			0
no date for the @entity22 hearing has yet been set			0
they said : ' in the circumstances it was appropriate that @entity26 carried out disciplinary processes with employees who admitted giving or facilitating gifts for advantage			1
' this is an ongoing process but outcomes so far have included training to those who gave gifts for advantage - not sanction			0
' to be clear : @entity26 will not tolerate racism or racist remarks from any of our employees , and racism goes completely against all our values as an organisation , as well as our policies			2
' claims are presently being subjected to a formal case management process by the tribunal			0
