@entity3 vs @entity4 , @entity5 vs @entity6 , @entity7 vs @entity8 , @entity9 vs @entity10 ... the rivalry between @entity1 and @entity2 is football 's response to these immortal sporting duels and the contest resumes on tuesday night in @entity15			1
these two giants of the international game find themselves on a collision course for the 27th time in their careers when @entity21 play @entity22 in a friendly at @entity24			1
their personal battle began in april 2008 , when @entity2 was still at @entity26 and they met @entity27 in the semi-finals of the @entity29			1
@entity2 and @entity1 resume their epic rivalry when @entity21 play @entity22 at @entity24 @entity2 was back on familiar ground at @entity24 as @entity22 geared up for the showpiece friendly @entity1 ( second left ) kicks out as @entity21 train at @entity35 ahead of the friendly games played : 26 @entity1 wins : 12 @entity2 wins : 7 draws : 7 @entity1 goals : 17 ronaldo goals : 15 @entity1 assists : 10 ronaldo assists : 1 it continued and intensified with a @entity44 final in 2009 and then grew more frequent when @entity2 made his Â£ 80m switch to @entity46 later that summer			1
since then , the bitter rivals have contested @entity48 in @entity49 , the @entity50 , the @entity51 and the @entity29 , with the balance of power swinging to and fro			0
this match will be only their second meeting for their countries , the first being a friendly staged in @entity56 back in february 2011			0
their rivalry splits fans right down the middle but admirers of @entity2 might want to look away - in their 26 meetings so far , @entity1 has been on the winning side in 12 of them , @entity2 in seven , with the other seven drawn			1
the @entity65 wizard has scored 17 times when they 've met compared with @entity2 's 15			1
@entity1 has also provided 10 assists compared with just one for his @entity69 nemesis			0
that first encounter back in 2008 - the semi-final , first leg of the @entity29 at the @entity73 - was n't an occasion @entity2 will remmember too fondly			1
the two players collide during the 2008 @entity29 semi-final , second leg between @entity26 and @entity27 at @entity24 - the @entity79 club won 1 - 0 thanks to a @entity82 screamer @entity1 and @entity2 compete for a header during the 2011 friendly between @entity21 and @entity22 the two players duel for the ball during the 2012 @entity51 match at the @entity73 comparison of performance in their 26 head - to - head encounters crosses / corners @entity1 - 30 @entity2 - 51 @entity90 @entity91 - 141 passes @entity93 - 632 successful passes @entity95 - 466 pass completion @entity1 - 87 % @entity2 - 74 % source : @entity98 he skied a second - minute penalty but @entity26 hung on to claim a 0 - 0 draw , going on to win the second leg by virtue of a @entity82 screamer and then lift the trophy by beating @entity106 in @entity107			1
@entity1 gained his revenge in @entity109 12 months later , scoring @entity27 's second goal in a 2 - 0 win over @entity26 in the final as @entity2 departed @entity24 on a low note			1
by the end of that year , the two players were beginning their still - rumbling rivalry in the @entity118 game and the 2009 - 2010 campaign saw first blood to @entity1 as @entity27 won home and away against their rivals			2
november 2010 saw perhaps the lowest point for @entity2 in the head - to - head when @entity27 thrashed real 5 - 0 - but @entity1 failed to find the net that night			1
both converted penalties as the return match at the @entity129 finished 1 - 1 and , four days later , the @entity69 scored an extra-time winner as @entity46 won a @entity132 final of the @entity50			0
the two teams were then drawn against one another in the semi-finals of the @entity29 and @entity1 again sparkled			2
@entity2 can only turn away as @entity1 and @entity136 celebrate @entity27 's 1 - 0 @entity49 win over @entity46 in 2010 @entity2 tries to stop @entity1 in his tracks during a january 2012 @entity50 meeting at the @entity73 he scored twice in the @entity129 during the first leg after @entity140 was sent off and a 1 - 1 draw at the @entity73 was enough to see @entity27 through to another final with @entity26 , which they won			1
the following season saw six meetings across the various competitions , with @entity27 winning three of them			0
@entity2 did , however , score the winner in @entity46 's 2 - 1 success at the @entity73 in the league late in the campaign , an important result as they broke @entity27 's strangehold on the title			2
the magical hold these two players have on their teams was perhaps best illustrated in the thrilling 2 - 2 draw at the @entity73 on october 7 , 2012 as both players scored twice			0
there were only the two @entity48 last season but march 's epic 4 - 3 win for @entity27 in the @entity129 saw @entity1 score a superb hat - trick , including two pressurised penalties			0
the latest meeting came late last month when a @entity2 penalty set real on their way to a 3 - 1 league win , ending @entity27 's unbeaten start			2
who knows what these two marvels of modern football will conjure up at @entity24 in the latest instalment of football 's most gripping personal rivalry			0
