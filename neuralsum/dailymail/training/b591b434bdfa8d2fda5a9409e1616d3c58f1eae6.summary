but there was no doubting the power of her sense of style			0
and while @entity10 paid tribute to @entity12 by wearing a pussy - bow blouse at her funeral yesterday , it is the @entity15 's signature handbag that is causing more of a storm out in the real world			2
since the announcement of @entity12 ’s death , luxury bag firm @entity22 - the brand also favoured by the @entity19 - has seen a 53 per cent rise in sales of the black structured handbag that @entity12 loved			1
@entity12 's handbag became associated both with her personal fashion and her political personality , with her fiery temper and the permanent presence of her rigid black bag causing mps to coin the phrase ' handbagging ' the @entity35 favored classic styles , often in black , such as the @entity38 ( left ) and @entity39 ( right ) style , which have both had a increase in sales following her death last monday @entity12 ’s love of a good handbag - frequently a @entity22 - became inextricably linked to her political persona – particularly after her ministers in the 1980s coined the phrase ‘ handbagging ’ - a reference to both the structured handbags she always carried and the dressing downs she would give her team			1
and now sales of the styles @entity12 treasured the most , including the @entity38 and the @entity39 , have seen a huge jump in sales			0
in a reflection of the impact of her death , the biggest spike in sales came at 9.30am on the day of her funeral and on the evening of monday 8 april after the announcement of her passing			2
@entity70 , ceo of @entity71 , fondly remembers how the relationship between his @entity74 label and @entity12 began , ‘ it was the early 80s and i saw a rather humorous cartoon in a national broadsheet of @entity12 waving around a rather understated handbag , and it suddenly struck me that she should be wearing our bags			0
styles including the @entity39 handbag which were her most treasured styles have seen a huge jump in sales since her death @entity12 's love of her black handbags spanned her entire political career , from her election to a member of parliament , to well after she had left @entity94 and retired ‘ with her majesty @entity19 a loyal supporter of @entity22 for many years by now , it seemed only fitting			1
‘ i sent one of our handbags ( in standard issue black , in the highest quality ) from our mainline collection to her with a cutting of the cartoon , and not long afterwards received a personal letter of thanks from @entity12 herself , who adored it			0
‘ i suspected she appreciated my sense of humour , also			0
thus , a longstanding relationship between @entity113 and @entity12 began until her passing this week '			0
the @entity19 has long been a fan of @entity22 bags , awarding the company a @entity116 in 1981 and is often seen at public events clasping one of their creations @entity10 wore a pussy bow blouse for the funeral of @entity12 yesterday , perhaps in tribute to the @entity15 's fondness for the style ( left ) whilst @entity12 embraced the gesture of a @entity127 handbag as a gift , she insisted on always purchasing them herself , or through her shopper who struck up a lasting friendship with @entity70			1
@entity12 would always send a letter of acknowledgement to @entity70 whenever she purchased a @entity127 handbag			0
she would usually make two purchases yearly throughout the 80s and 90s , all in a very , simple structured style in black or nude tones			0
@entity12 would always emphasise in her personal letters to @entity70 how much she wanted to support @entity2 business and would often purposefully carry @entity22 bags on foreign appointments			1
‘ there is a great deal of noise made around made in @entity2 these days , which we are a great advocate of as all our product is made in our factory in @entity151 with traditional @entity2 handmade techniques			1
@entity12 really understood the ethos of @entity113 and this is something she wanted to be associated with			0
interestingly , she would only buy bags for daywear , never eveningwear ’ @entity70 says			0
the firm experienced a similar spike in sales after the jubilee celebrations when the monarch was pictured on multiple occasions with her trusty @entity22 bags			1
then , the majority of sales were international , whereas in the case of @entity12 's sales spike , over 75 per cent of those purchasing the bags were in the @entity2			1
@entity113 has also seen a 43 per cent sales rise with its more colourful handbags and clutchbags including the @entity175 handbag in yellow ( left ) and the @entity177 in green ( right ) bags of laughter : a happy @entity19 pictured with two handbags as she toured the @entity127 leather factory in 1991 ' when @entity113 came to @entity183 from @entity184 over 60 years ago , he brought with him an idea that has remained with the company to this day ; handbags and leather goods should be elegant , be formed out of the best materials and made by highly skilled craftspeople			1
' over the last twenty five years @entity113 has built up an enviable reputation as a very high quality manufacturer with distinctively good styling , and currently hold the @entity116 to @entity194 @entity19 for handbags and small leather goods			0
' @entity22 's trademark is understated , elegant and classic - beautiful leather articles made with pride by craftsmen and women using traditional skills			1
with care , they give years of pleasure and service			0
