but one man has taken the art of the creative excuse to a new level and claimed his sexually transmitted disease was the result of car exhaust rather than cheating , according to his ex. 33 - year - old @entity15 , had , said ex-girlfriend @entity16 , offered up the novel excuse when accused of cheating after discovering that she had mysteriously contracted chlamydia			1
