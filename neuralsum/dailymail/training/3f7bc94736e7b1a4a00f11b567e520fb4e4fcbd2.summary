this is more about his choices			0
what is his thinking now ? is it go to a big club and try to break in there ? or go to a smaller club in not such a good league but ( where ) it easier to get into the first - team ? ‘ i think it is up to @entity3			1
if he chooses @entity36 , it would be what they want to pay			0
if he chooses @entity1 , then there are different prices			2
