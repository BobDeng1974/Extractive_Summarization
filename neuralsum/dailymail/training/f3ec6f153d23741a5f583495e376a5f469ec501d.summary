for nearly a decade , the @entity1 spacecraft has pulled back the misty veil that obscures @entity4 's largest moon , @entity5			1
its radar has revealed half of the giant moon 's surface , highlighting desert - like expanses of sand dunes and vast hydrocarbon seas			2
now , using a new technique for cleaning up @entity1 's radar images , these views have taken been transformed into high - definition images of its stunning features			1
pictured are side - by - side comparisons of a traditional @entity1 radar view ( left ) and one made using a new technique for handling electronic noise that results in clearer views of @entity5 's surface ( right )			1
show here is @entity30 , one of the large hydrocarbons seas on @entity5 the technique , referred to by its developers as ' despeckling , ' produces images of @entity5 's surface that are much clearer			1
with its thick atmosphere and organic - rich chemistry , @entity5 resembles a frozen version of @entity40 , several billion years ago , before life began pumping oxygen into our atmosphere			0
@entity5 is of interest to scientists because it is one of the most @entity40 - like worlds found to date			0
but trying to analyse its surface has been tricky for scientists because typically , @entity1 's radar images have a characteristic grainy appearance			1
the terrain seen here is in the flow region @entity56			0
with the speckle noise suppressed ( right ) , the overall pattern of bright and dark in the scene becomes more apparent			0
the left image shows the original photo this montage of @entity1 images of the surface of @entity5 shows examples of how a newly developed technique for handling noise results in clearer views			1
the top row of images was produced with the method used since the mission arrived atsaturn a decade ago ; the row at bottom was produced using the new technique a conceptual design of @entity78 's submarine that could be heading for @entity5 in 2040 if sending rovers to @entity80 was n't enough , @entity78 now wants to send submarines to @entity5			0
the space agency has outlined plans to launch the huge structure to @entity4 's largest moon by 2040			0
@entity78 's conceptual @entity5 submarine would weigh about one tonne ( 2,200 lb ) , and would use conventional electric propulsion over a 90 - day mission			0
@entity78 says it plans to send the submarine to @entity5 using a winged spacecraft similar to @entity93 @entity92 x- 37			0
the craft would survive hypersonic entry into moon ' atmosphere , release the submarine , while its sinks to the bottom of the alien ocean			0
@entity5 's atmosphere is largely made up of nitrogen and methane at a pressure one and half times that of @entity40 's , and with a temperature of -290 ° f ( -179 ° c )			2
@entity78 said the submarine would be driven by a @entity109 generator that would propel the craft and also prevent it from freezing			0
overall , it be able to travel at one metre per second ( 3.6 km / h , 2.2 mph )			0
this ' speckle noise ' can make it difficult to interpret small - scale features or identify changes in images of the same area taken at different times			2
@entity119 uses an algorithm to remove the noise , resulting in clearer views that can be easier for researchers to interpret			2
' noise in the images gave me headaches , ' @entity128 , who works at the astrophysics division of @entity131 's nuclear center			0
@entity128 found that a team near @entity133 was working on a ' de-noising ' algorithm , and he began working with them to adapt their model to the @entity1 radar data			0
' my headaches were gone , and more importantly , we were able to go further in our understanding of @entity5 's surface using the new technique , ' @entity128 said			1
@entity128 and colleagues have shown that they can produce @entity146 maps , called digital elevation maps , of @entity5 's surface with greatly improved quality			1
with clearer views of river channels , lake shorelines and windswept dunes , researchers are also able to perform more precise analyses of processes shaping @entity5 's surface			1
and @entity128 suspects that the speckle noise itself , when analysed separately , may hold information about properties of the surface and subsurface			1
' this new technique provides a fresh look at the data , which helps us better understand the original images , ' said @entity166 , deputy team lead of @entity1 's radar team			1
with this innovative new tool , we will look for details that help us to distinguish among the different processes that shape @entity5 's surface , ' he said			1
a landscape near the eastern shoreline of @entity174 , a hydrocarbon sea in @entity5 's north polar region			2
this image was processed using a technique for handling noise that results in clearer views that can be easier for researchers to interpret			2

@entity1 's radar images have a characteristic grainy appearance
the despeckling process uses an algorithm to remove the noise
this results in clearer views of the processes shaping @entity5 's surface
speckle noise may hold information about properties of the subsurface
