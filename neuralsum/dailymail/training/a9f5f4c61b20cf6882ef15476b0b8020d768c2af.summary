a new blood test could predict who will suffer from arthritis before it hits , allowing for early treatment to stop irreparable damage being done			1
@entity6 scientists hope the test could be available within five years - signifying hope for sufferers and potentially saving the @entity10 millions in expensive joint replacements			1
teams from @entity13 have identified two biomarkers - or indicators in the blood - which could help distinguish between a healthy person and one with osteoarthritis , a move which they hope would then help them identify which patients ' condition will worsen			1
a new blood test could predict who will suffer from arthritis before it hits , allowing for early treatment to stop irreparable damage being done osteoarthritis affects more than eight million people in the @entity6 and the damage it causes costs the @entity10 £ 5.2billion a year in treatment			1
a major cause of pain and disability , it 's caused by wear and tear on the joints , specifically the cartilage			0
osteoarthritis affects more than eight million people in the @entity6 and the damage it causes costs the @entity10 £ 5.2billion a year in treatment it also leads to the synovial fluid , a jelly - like substance which is secreted by the membrane that surrounds the joint , becoming thin and less elastic			2
the condition occurs more frequently in women than men , can sometimes be very painful , making movement and everyday tasks difficult			0
researcher dr @entity51 of @entity13 told the @entity52 that there was an urgent need to find better indicators of the disease , and that he and his team had identified two which were ' very useful '			2
the indicators - so called ' biomarkers ' - are found in the blood			2
he said : ' we hope to find out whether they can reliably distinguish between a healthy person and a person with osteoarthritis , identify which patients ’ condition will get worse , and whether a particular drug is working or not			0
' the @entity13 team has now been handed £ 300,000 by medical research charity @entity70			0
they will use the money to investigate if the biomarkers can be used for diagnosis and also to inform doctors if a patient 's condition is likely to worsen over time .			0

scientists have identified two biomarkers - or indicators in the blood
they hope they could help distinguish between those with the condition
this could then be used to help predict how tight the disease will take grip
the @entity6 scientists hope the test could be available within five years
