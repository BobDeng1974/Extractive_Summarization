found : this sturgeon , named @entity8 , escaped from @entity9 in @entity10 during the flooding floods : he was swept away from the centre ( pictured ) after the nearby @entity11 burst its banks last month scene : now , four weeks later , @entity8 has been discovered in a puddle at this car wash ( pictured ) - a staggering one mile away from the aquatic centre			1
but despite his plight , the fish has been safely returned to the centre now , four weeks later , he has been discovered in a puddle at a car wash - a staggering one mile away from the aquatic centre			1
but despite his plight , @entity8 has been safely returned to the centre - and is making good progress			1
general manager , @entity34 , said : ' we have a lot of display gardens and big ponds outside the centre , featuring fish that are not for sale			0
' @entity8 lives in one of those ponds and he escaped , along with his friend - a large koi carp fish named @entity44 - when we were flooded			0
journey : during his one - mile trip , @entity8 swam across a main road , flooded fields and a petrol station forecourt pleased : @entity34 , general manager of the aquatic centre , said staff at the car wash had been shocked by @entity8			1
' the staff were a bit taken aback because sturgeons look quite shark - like , ' said mr @entity34 ' as the weeks passed , eventually the water began to subside , and then we got a call from staff at a car wash about one mile away			2
' they said they thought they ’d found one of our fish in a puddle and they were a bit taken aback because sturgeons look quite shark - like			0
' but sure enough , there he was alive and well			0
he ’d been living in the deep puddle at the car wash			0
' mr @entity34 said that @entity8 had been ' a bit worse for wear ' with several ' bumps and scratches ' when he was found			1
underwater : @entity8 , who lived in a big pond outside @entity9 , escaped with his friend - a large koi carp fish named @entity44 - when the centre was flooded			2
above , the centre is pictured during the heavy floods path : the three - foot sturgeon swam down this main road at some point during his journey to the car wash another sight : he also made his way across this petrol station forecourt , before ending up in a puddle at the car wash			1
the fish was later discovered in ' a bit worse for wear ' state , sporting several bumps and scratches ' ' we could n’t believe he had got so far , because his route would have included travelling across fields , a main road and around the petrol station , ' he said			1
' we do n’t know if he went through the car wash , but medics say he is making a good recovery back with his friends at the centre			2
he has had an incredible adventure , but i think he ’s glad to be back home			0
' but while @entity8 has been reunited with the aquatic centre , @entity44 has not yet been so lucky			2
not so lucky : while @entity8 has been reunited with the aquatic centre ( pictured today ) , @entity44 is still missing the 15 - year - old koi carp - which is also three - foot long and weighs about 25 pounds - is still missing			2
' we are delighted that @entity8 is back with us , but we are still really keen to find @entity116 , ' said mr @entity34			0
' they are both pond or lake fish , so @entity116 will have headed for flooded fields and places like that			0
' he is a very big fish , so we hope that someone will spot him and that we can reunite him with @entity125 at the centre soon			0
