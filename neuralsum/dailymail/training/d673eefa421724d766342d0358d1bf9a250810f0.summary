by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity4 cigarette maker @entity3 is in talks to acquire rival @entity6 in a multi-billion dollar deal that would reshape one of the world 's biggest and most profitable tobacco markets , the companies said on friday			1
a deal would also involve the sale of some brands to @entity15 's @entity14 to address potential antitrust concerns , as well as the purchase of more shares in @entity19 by @entity20 ( @entity21 ) , its largest shareholder			2
in a statement confirming what people familiar with the matter previously told @entity1 , @entity19 , @entity28 player in the @entity29 with brands including @entity31 and @entity32 , said the talks were consistent with its strategy of weighing options that would help boost shareholder value			2
merger : @entity3 , which manufactures @entity32 and @entity31 brand cigarettes , plans to merge with rival @entity6 buying @entity6 , which had a stock market value of $ 22.9 billion on thursday , would give @entity19 the leading @entity4 menthol cigarette @entity41 and its leading e-cigarette blu			1
analysts say the combination could also generate $ 500 million in annual cost savings , helping the @entity28 and @entity4 players compete with @entity48 maker and @entity49 in a market where sales volume is falling about 4 percent a year as more @entity29 quit smoking			2
despite the decline , the @entity4 remains the biggest tobacco market in the world after @entity56 and the most profitable			0
' @entity19 is getting both a fantastic brand in @entity41 and strong intellectual property in the e-cig category , ' said analyst @entity60 at research firm @entity61			1
' it 's a good deal strategically , we just need to know what they 're paying			2
if they pay a premium to today 's price , it 's going to be on the rich end of historical deals			0
' billions : the @entity73 merger would give @entity19 control of @entity41 brand cigarettes , the most popular @entity29 menthol cigarette historically , he said tobacco deals have fetched an average enterprise value ( equity plus debt ) of about 12 times earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortization , which is about where @entity6 's stock was trading on friday , up 4.8 percent in @entity87			1
@entity20 , which owns 42 percent of @entity19 , said that if the deal proceeds , it would expect to support it by buying more shares in @entity19 with the aim of maintaining its current stake , which is the company 's only exposure to the @entity4 market			0
over the last 50 years , the @entity29 has seen several waves of lawsuits against tobacco firms , including complaints by individuals , class action suits and a massive racketeering case			0
cases have concerned the industry 's negligence , disclosure of health risks and advertising practices			0
litigation risks contributed to the 2008 separation of @entity110 and @entity111 , which is now the world @entity112 selling @entity114 everywhere except the @entity29			0
but analysts say the litigation risk has waned , so there is now more openness to trade there			0
blu : the merger also would also give @entity19 control over blu , the most popular e-cig in @entity29 ' a lot of the more extreme class action suits have n't really made the progress people thought they might , ' said @entity129 analyst @entity128 , who questioned whether by buying into the @entity29 , @entity14 would be taking on additional risk			1
' i 'd have thought that given @entity14 's leverage in the negotiations , they will be able to insist that they do n't , ' he said			0
@entity14 , known for its @entity137 and @entity138 cigarettes , said it was in talks with @entity19 and @entity6 about buying certain assets they might sell but saw no guarantee the proposed deal would come off			1
a source familiar with the situation said @entity14 was lining up about $ 7 billion to finance the potential purchase of brands such as @entity148 and @entity149 , which would ease antitrust concerns thrown up by a @entity19 - @entity6 combination			1
@entity19 , @entity6 and @entity20 said there were no assurances a deal will be reached			1
they added that unless circumstances dictate otherwise , they did not intend to comment further .			0

@entity3 is in talks to acquire @entity6 , which manufactures @entity41 cigarettes
@entity6 's stock value currently is nearly $ *23* billion
the merger would also give control of the popular blu e-cigs to @entity3
