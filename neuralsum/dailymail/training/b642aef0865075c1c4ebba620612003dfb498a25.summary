following reports there are now more than a billion websites , researchers have created a map that reveals just how far and wide these sites penetrate the globe			1
the map was created by researchers at the @entity9 using 2011 data on web users and total population datasets from the @entity13			1
it reveals that @entity15 is now home to the world ’s largest internet population at over half a billion , followed by the @entity18 , @entity19 , and @entity20			1
hover your mouse over the interactive module to explore the map the map was created by researchers at the @entity9 using 2011 data on web users from the @entity13			1
the data is visualised using a hexagon - shaped cartogram , in which the size of each country is drawn based on its penetration			0
each hexagon accounts for approximately one third of a million internet users the data is visualised using what 's known as a hexagon - shaped cartogram , in which the size of each country is drawn based on its internet - enabled population			1
each hexagon accounts for approximately one third of a million internet users			2
cartographers dr @entity45 and @entity46 from the institute said countries with fewer than that number were removed from the map			0

each hexagon accounts for approximately one third of a million internet users , and countries with fewer than that number were removed from the map			1
the shading of each country reflects its internet penetration rate , and darker shades indicate higher levels of internet usage in that population			2
this means that some countries may appear larger because they have a higher proportion of people using the web , but when looked at the population as a whole , the penetration may be low			2
the top category of internet penetration is where more than 80 per cent of residents are online			0
the bottom category features countries with a penetration of less than 20 per cent			0
this included a number of @entity85 countries including @entity86 and @entity87			0

this means that some countries may appear larger because they have a higher proportion of people using the web , but when compared to the population as a whole , the penetration may be low			0
the @entity13 has tracked the number of web users and connections per country since the 1996 , as part of its @entity104 project			1
its data reveals that 42 per cent of the world ’s internet users live in @entity108 - and @entity15 , @entity19 , and @entity20 alone host more internet users than @entity111 and @entity112 combined			1
the top category of internet penetration is where more than 80 per cent of residents are online , and few of the world ’s largest countries fall into this category			1
this suggests that in all of the world ’s largest internet nations , there is still substantial room for growth , claim the researchers			1
all but four of the countries with an internet penetration rate of more 80 per cent are in @entity111 , including @entity129 , the @entity130 , and @entity131			2
the exceptions are @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 , and @entity136			0
most @entity138 countries now have a penetration rate of more than 40 per cent , and the region as a whole now hosts almost as many internet users as the @entity18 , continued the researchers			1
in the last three years , almost all @entity85 countries have doubled their population of web users , with @entity147 being the exception			1
however , more than half of @entity151 countries have a penetration of less than 10 per cent			0
last month , @entity155 - based internet cartographer and computer scientist @entity153 used software to ‘ ping ’ every web device on the globe , and used the signals to create a map ( pictured ) demonstrating the technology ’s global reach last year , dr @entity45 and mr @entity46 used data from analytics firm @entity166 to map the largest websites around the world ( pictured )			1
@entity171 topped the list , in 62 countries , @entity170 was the second most visited site globally , in 50 countries , while third place , @entity15 's @entity178 search engine , was popular in just two countries last month , @entity155 - based internet cartographer and computer scientist @entity153 used software to ‘ ping ’ every web device on the globe , and used the signals to create a map demonstrating the technology ’s global reach			1
in the majority of cases , this signal was sent to routers rather than individual gadgets , but mr @entity153 said @entity191 and @entity193 devices have appeared previously			0
the cartographer said it took around five hours to ping all ip addresses on august 2			0
the map then took more than 12 hours to create			0
last year , dr @entity45 and mr @entity46 used information collected by website analytics firm @entity166 to map the largest websites around the world , as of july and august 2013			2
@entity171 topped the list , in 62 countries , @entity170 was the second most visited site globally , in 50 countries , while the third place site - @entity15 's @entity178 search engine , was popular in just two countries			0
to work out the number of visitors , dr @entity45 and @entity207 from the institute combined the number of estimated average daily unique visitors , with the estimated number of page views for that site from users in a particular country , for a particular month			0
each colour represents the most visited website in that country and each three individual blocks represent around one million users .			0

the map was created by researchers from the @entity9
it uses 2011 data on internet users and population from the @entity13
@entity15 is home to the world ’s largest internet population at over half a billion
@entity18 , @entity19 , and @entity20 follow as the next most populous nations of web users
in fact , @entity15 , @entity19 , and @entity20 host more web users than @entity111 and @entity112 combined
