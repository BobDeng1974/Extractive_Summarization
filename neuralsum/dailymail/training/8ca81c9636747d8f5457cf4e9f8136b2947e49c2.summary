a new knife is hoping to solve the age - old problem of spreading butter straight from the fridge			2
the @entity5 ! blade uses a heat - transfer system that captures a users body heat to melt through hard butter			1
the advanced technology means that the device requires no batteries , charging or power of any sort			0
it uses a copper alloy tube which transfers heat from the palm to the blade its designers developed the device using a copper alloy tube which instantly transfers heat from the palm of a hand to the end of the blade			1
weighing just 3oz ( 85g ) , it uses no electric or batteries , no heating or hot water , and most importantly , requires no heat - up period			1
the device has proved a success on crowdfunding website @entity38 , surpassing its $ 20,000 ( £ 12,400 ) target within days			0
writing on their @entity38 page , the company said : ' we discovered that the current butter spreaders on the market are simply not adequate for spreading butter			0

@entity5 ! blade uses heat - transfer system to harness body heat
designers developed a copper alloy tube which instantly transfers heat from the palm to the end of the blade so cold , hard butter can be spread
it uses no electric or batteries , no heating or hot water , and most importantly , needs no heat - up period
the item is not yet on sale but is expected to retail at around $ *25* ( £ 15 )
