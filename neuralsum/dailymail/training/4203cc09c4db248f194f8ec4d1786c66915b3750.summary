@entity1 clash with @entity2 did n’t serve up the quality we hoped for but it was still an intriguing game			1
@entity1 will feel their performance deserved better but how many times are they going to lose goals from attacking positions ? they have conceded 24 goals in all competitions so far this season and eight of them — exactly a third — have been let in on the counter-attack			0
they are naive at the back and you do n’t need to have played football to realise their defence is weak and they are crying out for a defensive midfielder			2
@entity32 has staked a claim but he has completed 90 minutes in the @entity35 only once in the last nine months			1
that is an incredible statistic			0
he has had a lot of injuries but for that role you need to be consistent and robust			0
in the same period @entity42 has started 23 league games for @entity44 and been subbed just once			1
like centre backs , defensive midfielders are hard to find but @entity47 could be their best option			2
whether @entity24 would be prepared to leave out his captain @entity49 , though , is another matter			1
@entity1 need a defensive midfielder but captain @entity49 's place in their engine room appears secure @entity26 's renaissance people say @entity26 plays better when he ’s angry , but i ’ve never subscribed to that theory			1
the responsibility of being captain of @entity60 and @entity2 seems to be making him more disciplined and controlled			1
he looks comfortable in himself and he was excellent at the @entity31			0
at the start of the season there was a question as to whether he or @entity66 should be captain			0
at the moment , there ’s no comparison			0
it ’s been a good week for @entity26 , winning his 100th cap and scoring goals , and as our table below shows , this is his second best start to a season			2
@entity60 captain @entity26 notched the decisive second @entity2 goal at @entity1 @entity80 dishes out some instructions to @entity26 , who has taken on the captain responsibilities magpies flying what a difference a bit of time can make			1
six weeks ago @entity88 looked a dead man walking			0
now @entity90 have won five in a row for the first time since 2012 and are only outside the top four on goal difference			1
all credit to @entity88 and his players for an incredible turnaround			0
@entity90 boss @entity88 ( centre ) was all smiles as @entity100 clinched a late winner against @entity102 at last the @entity103 on saturday @entity104 finally served up the kind of display he was putting in week in , week out last season			1
toure has been heavily criticised but i hope he now takes the season by the scruff of the neck			0
he took his goal well , as our graphic below shows			0
it was the kind of surging @entity104 run that we ’ve become so used to			1
if @entity119 want to retain their title they must keep that fighting spirit			0
an eight - point gap to the imperious @entity44 is not insurmountable but they ca n’t afford any more slip ups			2
@entity104 celebrates after scoring what turned out to be the winner for @entity119 against @entity127 the @entity128 slotted home after a typically powerful run at the away defence at the @entity132 so it 's not all @entity134 ... @entity136 's form this season has taken a lot of heat off this @entity141 team			1
@entity142 meant he was nowhere to be seen at @entity143 but still the side looked so poor throughout			1
it ’s time @entity147 gave his players some home truths , but i ’m not sure he ’s the type of manager to do that — he likes to protect his players			2
but since losing to @entity44 at @entity156 last season , they have lost seven of their last 15 league games			1
that ’s not good enough			0
@entity162 put in one of the best performances of the season , but any winger would have fancied their chances against @entity168			0
the injured @entity136 ( pictured at the @entity169 ) was missing for @entity141 's defeat at @entity143 @entity171 and @entity173 look beaten men after @entity141 again blew a one - goal lead in south @entity176 @entity177 and @entity178 celebrate after @entity143 took a lead they would not relinquish @entity181 it was only a matter of time before @entity183 started to bang in the goals in the @entity35			1
for some there is an inferiority complex when they step up , but @entity183 now looks right at home			2
he scored 26 last season and will get even more when @entity191 returns from injury — they scored 47 between them in 2013 - 14			2
in @entity196 they have one of the most positive people i have ever met to lead them , and back - to - back wins shows they are not just here to make up the numbers			2
@entity183 wheels away with @entity205 as @entity206 beat @entity207 at the @entity208 the @entity60 under 21 striker poached past @entity210 goalkeeper @entity211 during the 2 - 1 win @entity213 's happy 400th there ca n’t be many better ways to cap your 400th club appearance than by scoring a winner at home			1
@entity219 has been a great servant and a classy player for @entity221			0
they are now two points off the top four and with teams around them stuttering , there ’s no reason why they ca n’t target a @entity230 place			0
@entity221 midfielder looked delighted to cap his 400th club appearance with the winner against @entity234			0

@entity24 's side lost 2 - 1 against @entity2 on saturday
the @entity239 ' defensive *problems* were all too *evident* yet again
@entity90 are flying after winning five games in a row
it was only a matter of time before @entity104 started producing
@entity141 *remained* poor without @entity136 at @entity143
@entity206 striker @entity183 is finding his feet in the @entity35
