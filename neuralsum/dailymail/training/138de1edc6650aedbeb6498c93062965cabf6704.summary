but the ' do n't hate me because i 'm beautiful ' writer says that work is now at the bottom of her priorities list , with husband @entity11 firmly placed in the top spot			1
' probably the single biggest thing i 've learned about myself since moving to @entity14 is that the rat race is n't the be all and end all , ' she says			2
now i 've changed my priorities completely			0
' i 'm a wife first , a stepmother second and a writer third , and i say it in that order deliberately because those are the priorities in my life now			0
' speaking in a video released by publishers , @entity32 , @entity1 was also happy to open up about her future plans , which , she says , include becoming a farmer			1
' there 's never a dull moment in my part of @entity14 and the future is really exciting , ' she revealed			2
' we 're planning to have a baby ; we 're starting a family			0
we 're also planning to buy a farm and i 'm going to become a @entity14 female farmer in the not too distant future			1
' but before realising her agricultural dreams , @entity1 has her new book , @entity49 in @entity14 , to finish promoting			1
love : head over heels in @entity14 is for people who want a love story or who are curious about @entity14 life first : @entity1 says that husband @entity11 is now her top priority while work has been pushed down the list the book , which tells the story of her first year on the opposite side of the @entity62 reveals how she fell in love with carpenter husband @entity11 and how she coped with transitioning from high flying tv executive to @entity14 housewife			1
' the reason i wrote @entity68 in @entity14 is because at the age of 36 in 2007 , the biggest thing that ever happened to me in my life occurred in that i fell in love with a @entity14 , ' she explains			2
' a camouflage - wearing , gitane - smoking muscly macho macho carpenter - in other words , the complete opposite of me			0
' i fell head over heels in love and so i moved to @entity14 where i did n't even speak the language , and i just made this life - changing decision on a whim and for 12 months of my life , every day i woke up to something new and to something different and it was extraordinary			0
' @entity49 in @entity14 is going to be read , i hope , by anyone who is attracted to a love story			0
it 's also for those people who are fascinated by and curious about what life in @entity14 is really like			2
