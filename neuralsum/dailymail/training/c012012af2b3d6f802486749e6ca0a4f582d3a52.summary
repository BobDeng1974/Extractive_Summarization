as ever , numerous women came scantily clad like their favorite characters - some wore little more than panties and tape			0
it is a controversial issue that has plagued the event for years as many cosplayers complain they are fondled and intrusive photos are taken of them and later posted on the internet			2
in a bid to tackle the controversy , organizers this year hung posters warning people that ' cosplay does not mean consent ' , that they should keep their hands to themselves , and ask for permission before taking photos			0
