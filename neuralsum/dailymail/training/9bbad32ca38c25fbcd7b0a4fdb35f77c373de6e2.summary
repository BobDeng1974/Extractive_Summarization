if the weeks of torrential rain were not bad enough , homeowners have a new problem to contend with - rats			1
experts say scores of rat communities have been displaced by the recent flash floods and they are looking for shelter - in your home			0
the water - deluged drains and sewers of the past few weeks have mobilised rat populations previously living underground , driving them above the flood waters and in some cases through cracked drains and into homes , according to drainage specialists @entity197			2
the insurance handling company believes the nation ’s booming rat population – currently at 80 million – will continue to rise			2
the combination of flash flooding , an ageing sewer system , councils cutting back on services including pest control and weekly bin collections and insurers failing to adequately repair damaged drains , is creating the perfect breeding ground for rats in residential areas			0
@entity212 , ceo of @entity197 , said : ' one of the biggest issues we are currently seeing is rats who have been moved around by the flood waters finding their way through cracked pipe work and into properties			0
' home owners in the @entity221 , @entity222 and @entity223 have already reported a surge in rat problems and unfortunately this is likely to continue as the flood waters subside			2
' resilient rats are capable of swimming up to half a mile , even against the current , in a sewer pipe			0
and young rodents can squeeze through holes as small as one centimetre wide and capable of creating significant damage by chewing through pipe work and building materials			0
rats are also extremely difficult to eradicate once they have established a nest , with females capable of producing litters of up to 10 , 10 times a year			0
mr @entity212 added : ' once rats enter a home , because of the serious health risks that they pose , the only course of action is trapping or poisoning which runs the risk of decaying and infected bodies being trapped within the fabric of a property			0
' it is far better to address the problem outside of the property by preventing rats from establishing a location within the sewage system and working their way into the home			0
' i would urge property owners affected by the recent floods , even if they have n’t noticed any visible sign of rats , to get their drains checked and ensure they have adequate protection for their drainage systems through their buildings insurance policy ’s accidental damage clauses			0
