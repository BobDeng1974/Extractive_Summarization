a huge stone carving crafted by the ancient @entity3 civilisation that has been hidden inside a pyramid in @entity5 for centuries , shows a battle of superpowers in 6th century @entity9 , archaeologists have said			1
the giant frieze featuring inscriptions and brightly coloured painting was discovered last month at a dig in the north east @entity15 region of the country at the @entity18 archaeological dig. the archaeologists believe evidence suggests that the rulers of the region were embroiled in a political clash of the titans between the kings of @entity26 - the @entity27 - and the kings of @entity29			1
archaeologist @entity30 cleans an inscription below an ancient stucco frieze recently unearthed in the buried @entity33 of @entity18 in the @entity15 region of @entity5			1
the frieze of the @entity33 culture is 8m long and 2m tall ans is one of the best preserved examples of its kind according to the @entity41 the frieze , which is eight metres wide and two metres tall and stands along the exterior of a multi-roomed rectangular building , was found in a 20 metre high pyramid built in the 8th century , in a style typical of the @entity33			1
much of the building still remains encased under the rubble of the later 20m - high structure			2
the carving is painted in red , with details in blue , green and yellow			2
@entity54 , director of the @entity41 that made the discovery , said : ' this is a unique find			1
it is a beautiful work of art and it tells us so much about the function and meaning of the building , which was what we were looking for			2
' the carving depicts human figures in a mythological setting , suggesting they may be deified rulers			1
it shows three human figures wearing elaborate bird headdresses and jade jewels seated cross-legged over the head of a mountain spirit known as a witz			1
a cartouche on the headdress contains glyphs identifying each individual by name			2
the central figure ’s name is the only one that is legible but the inscription says : @entity85 , meaning ' the storm god enters the sky			0
' two feathered serpents emerge from the mountain spirit below the main character and form an arch with their bodies			0
the frieze shows images of governors , gods and inscriptions			1
the central human figure wears an elaborate bird headdress and jade jewels ans is seated cross-legged over the head of a mountain spirit known as a witz under each of them is a seated figure of an aged god holding a sign that reads ' first tamale			1
' in front of the serpents ’ mouths are the two additional human figures , also seated on mountain spirit heads			1
at the bottom of the carving there are bands of glyphs that reveal the grand frieze was commissioned by the ruler of @entity122 - a superpower kingdom south of @entity18			1
in the dedication , king @entity124 claims to have restored the local ruling line and patron deities			0
the images and glyphic text on the frieze also provide information about political actors in the @entity133 well beyond this small kingdom			2
the writing says the ruler , was also referred to as a ' vassal of the @entity26 king ' the snake lord			0
' when this building was erected , @entity141 kings were already on their way to controlling much of the lowlands , except @entity29 of course , ' said @entity54			0
mr @entity54 told @entity146 : ' it 's all a grand scheme of building a maya empire			0
sometimes the @entity150 kings were on top			0
sometimes @entity29 was on top			0
but there was nothing chaotic about it			0
' at the bottom of the carving there are bands of glyphs ( pictured ) that reveal the grand frieze was commissioned by the ruler of @entity122 - a superpower kingdom south of @entity18			1
in the dedication , king @entity164 inich claims to have restored the local ruling line and patron deities according to @entity168 , a @entity169 epigrapher who worked on the project , the text places the building in the decade of the 590s and provides the first glimpse of the remarkable extent of @entity176 ’s political and religious authority			1
' it also reveals how a new order was literally imprinted on a broader landscape of local gods and ancestors , ' she said			0
at the time , the @entity29 kings had established new dynasties and far - reaching alliances with kingdoms throughout the @entity187 , perhaps thanks to a connection with @entity190 ’s greatest state , @entity191			0
@entity29 suffered a defeat in the year 562 by the @entity194 ' kingdom , which , for the following 180 years , would come to dominate most other @entity196 kingdoms			0
the find came as the team excavated in a tunnel left open by looters			0
the archaeologists unearthed a tomb associated with the pyramid last year containing an individual accompanied by 28 ceramic vessels and a wooden funerary mask			2
it was found in a cavity dug into the stairway leading up to the building and the skeleton of an adult male and his ceramic offering were preserved by large limestone slabs that kept the tomb free of debris			2
intriguingly his incisor and canine teeth had been drilled and filled with jade beads , while two miniature flower - shaped ear spools were also found			1
the archeologists said the iconography on the vessels discovered in the tomb bore clear references to the nine lords of the underworld as well as to the aged sun god of the underworld			2
there were two sets of nine painted bowls decorated with the water lily motif and nine red - painted plates and one spouted tripod plate decorated with the image of the god of the underworld emerging from a shell			0
because of the unusually high number of vessels and the jade dental decorations , mr @entity54 believes the individual found may have been a member of the ruling class at @entity18			1
the team hopes to return to the area in 2014 to continue exploring and to preserve the buildings			0
the research was supported by the @entity253 / @entity252 .			0
