the new aid package and the illegal immigration crisis at the @entity6 border will be the subject of vice president @entity27 's meetings this afternoon in @entity14 with senior representatives of the @entity3 countries			1
the president 's @entity56 policy initiative only applies to illegal immigrants who came to the @entity6 under the age of 16 before june 15 , 2012 and had lived in the @entity6 continuously for five years before that dates			0

the @entity0 says @entity6 immigration officials repatriated 47,769 illegal immigrants from @entity14 , 37,049 from @entity15 , and 21,602 from @entity13 last year			1
that makes up approximately 29 percent of all @entity76 agency deportations			0

today the @entity0 announced that it would provide additional resources to the @entity99 and @entity100 so that they can process removals of illegal immigrants more rapidly			2
in a letter to president @entity50 , house speaker @entity103 called on the president to go one step further and ' immediately deploy the @entity107			1
' ' the @entity107 is uniquely qualified to respond to such humanitarian crises , ' @entity103 said			0
' they are able to help deal with both the needs of these children and families as well as relieve the border patrol to focus on their primary duty of securing our border			0
' president @entity50 has not yet responded to @entity103 's letter , but it divulged this afternoon that it would give @entity3 countries $ 9.6 million to expand their repatriation centers so that they can intake returned migrants more quickly			1
the @entity6 will give another $ 40 million to @entity14 , $ 25 million to @entity13 and $ 18.5 million to @entity15 for at - risk youth services that are intended to slow the rate of gang growth and migration to @entity3 , in addition to the $ 161.5 million it is giving to the region for similar programs			1

' this afternoon @entity27 met with @entity14 president @entity31 and @entity14 vice president @entity153			2
later he will meet with @entity13 president @entity154			0
' the surge of unaccompanied minors making the very perilous journey from @entity3 to the @entity162 and often if not primarily in the hands of smuggling networks that engage in physical and sexual abuse of these children , ' @entity27 said in a statement after his meeting with the @entity14 government			2
' this is a serious humanitarian issue standing alone all by itself , and … it is a fundamentally shared problem for the @entity6 , @entity46 , and this entire region			0
' in his remarks , @entity27 acknowledge that ' the current situation is not sustainable			0
' ' it is unacceptable , ' he said			0
but it is important that @entity14 recognize and address the root reasons children are fleeing the country , @entity27 said			0
' especially poverty , insecurity and the lack of the rule of law , so the people can stay and thrive in their own communities , ' @entity27 said , ' so a parent does n’t feel so desperate that they put their child in the hands of a criminal network and say take him , and take her to the @entity6			2
' @entity14 's president said in his own statement that he had asked the @entity6 to give illegal immigrants from @entity3 a ' temporary protected status ' that would allow them to stay in the @entity6 because of how dangerous it has become to live in their home countries			1

during a phone call with @entity194 on thursday night @entity50 explained to his @entity46 counterpart that neither his @entity56 policy nor his comprehensive immigration reform legislation that is stalled in the @entity201 would provide amnesty to the hundreds of children crossing the @entity6 border each day			2
yesterday , @entity50 also talked with the @entity46 president about a regional strategy that includes the governments of @entity3 countries to reduce the number of children coming to the @entity6 illegally			1

the vice president called @entity15 president @entity217 to discuss the regional strategy earlier today on the plane to @entity14 , the @entity0 said			1
he will meet in person with senior representatives from @entity15 and @entity46 this afternoon , as well			0

more than 47,000 children have *poured* into the @entity6 through the @entity46 border since october
most of them are running away from @entity13 , @entity15 and @entity14
they are under the misconception that once they arrive in the @entity6 they *'ll* be able to stay forever
the build - up at the border is causing a humanitarian crisis at immigrant detention **facilities**
the @entity0 announced today that it would give $ 254.6 million to @entity3 countries to expand their repatriation **facilities** and at - risk youth programs
the @entity6 also plans to start detaining families at the border instead of giving them a court date and letting them go
vice president @entity27 is in @entity14 today to meet with @entity3 leaders to discuss ways they can make their countries safer while reducing child immigration to the @entity6
house speaker @entity103 wants @entity50 to send the @entity107 to border to handle the humanitarian crisis so that @entity41 can do its job
