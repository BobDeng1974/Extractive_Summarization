there must have been times during the past nine months when @entity2 felt the lights had gone out on his career			1
at the @entity6 in @entity7 , the lights did quite literally go out - but @entity2 was certainly back with a vengeance			1
the right back suffered an abdominal injury way back in march			1
it curtailed his season with @entity14 and , worse still , precluded him from the @entity15 with @entity16 , a tournament he almost certainly would have been picked for			1
it did n’t help one bit that @entity2 had missed @entity35 with a broken toe			1
was he cursed ? it must have crossed his mind			0
‘ it has been a difficult long term injury to cope with , both mentally and physically			1
i had to dig deep , ’ he added			0
but here , on a miserable wet evening in @entity7 , in front of a half - empty arena which was plunged into darkness for a quarter - hour in the first - half , a fully - charged @entity2 made his return after that horribly long absence			1
and it did n’t look as though he ’d missed a day			0
in the @entity50 era , it looks like a fight between @entity2 and @entity53 ’s @entity52 to be @entity16 ’s right back			1
@entity2 ’s bid to impress @entity28 began here			2
as his body recovered , @entity2 had ample time to dissect his game			2
could tweaks be made ? what could be done better ? @entity62 's side had already qualified from their @entity63 before the match the @entity66 - born full back could n't prevent @entity14 slipping to a 1 - 0 loss to @entity20 on his return he confessed in the build - up to his return that his positional play - in other words his defensive play - could be improved			1
that voice in his head that told him to get his head down and bomb forward at every opportunity needed to be hushed a little			0
‘ i think it will make me a better player , ’ @entity2 said on the eve of this game			2
so @entity2 has been deconstructed and reassembled			2
on this evidence , it ’s to very promising effect			0
in many ways , this was the perfect match to be thrown back into			0
since being declared match fit , @entity2 had only played 66 minutes of an under 21 match with @entity91 at the @entity92 in @entity93			2
so , from @entity95 to ' @entity96 ' - or at least a pale imitation of it			0
with both sides already through , there was nothing riding on this one and it showed , with those assembled filling barely a third of the 76,000 - capacity @entity104			0
@entity2 could re-immerse himself with out the pressure of needing to win the match and he was straight into the thick of things			2
within seconds of the the start , @entity2 was making clearing headers and just three minutes in , he was off on his first charge forward , drawing a foul on the half - way line			1
@entity2 , who missed the @entity15 in @entity29 , has been out for nine months with an abdominal injury @entity52 has emerged as @entity16 's first choice this season after brilliant displays for @entity53 we were then plunged into darkness on eight minutes , the floodlights completely failing to leave only the sponsor boards and hundreds of mobile phone screens for illumination			1
the players were off for 16 minutes in all , but it did n’t interrupt @entity2 ’s power surges			2
there one moment in particular when we knew the old player was back			0
@entity130 had the ball but , confronted by the @entity20 defence , had nowhere really to turn			0
then , suddenly , like an express train , @entity2 had darted forward 30 yards to offer an overlap			0
the resulting cross did n’t result in anything for @entity14 but his willingness to support the attack was promising			1
he was even more effective after the interval , getting into good positions and skinning his man on three or four occasions before swinging in a cross			0
@entity2 was replaced on 76 minutes by @entity144 , not as yet ready to play a full 90			0
but he ’d done more than enough to suggest his best form wo n’t be too far away			0
fans at the @entity147 had to use their phones after the lights went out to suspend play @entity2 shakes hands with members of @entity14 's bench after being substituted in @entity7			1

@entity14 lost 1 - 0 to @entity20 in their @entity63 clash
the floodlights failed twice , causing delays at the @entity6
the result means @entity62 's side finish second in their group
@entity2 made his long - awaited return from injury in @entity7
@entity2 had been out for nine months with an abdominal injury
