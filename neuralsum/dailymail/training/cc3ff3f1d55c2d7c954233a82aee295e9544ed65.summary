doll face : 200,000 people in @entity2 are having nose jobs each year to mimic the western look young women in @entity2 , some as young as 14 , are having cosmetic surgery in the hope of attaining the @entity9 ' doll face '			1
@entity2 has been named the nose job capital of the world - with seven times more operations carried out there than in @entity14 - despite the high cost of the surgery			1
cosmetic procedures cost five to six times the average monthly wage in @entity2 but according to a report in their conservative @entity21 newspaper , as many as 200,000 @entity2 are undergoing rhinoplasty operations every year			2
the reasons behind the surgery include self - esteem and marriageability , as well as medical issues and the fact that some women in the country find the @entity32 practice of the hijab so limiting when it comes to beauty			1
one woman told @entity37 : ' it 's human nature to want to seek out attention with a beautiful figure , hair , skin â€¦ but hijab does n't let you do that			0
' so we have to satisfy that instinct by displaying our ' art ' on our faces			0
' the newspaper also reported concerns that the surge in demand has led to a huge increase in unlicensed practioners and means that some people are putting their health at risk in their quest for a new face			1
in @entity63 there are only 157 licensed plastic surgeons but there are 7,000 unlicensed surgeons			0
problems associated with botched procedures include respiratory problems , the nose being dented or malformed , sinus pain and congestion during the winter months , growth of extra tissue or bone , and loss of the sense of smell			0
the prohibitive price has meant that some are also taking out bank loans , often under deception , to fund the surgery			0
stand - up comedian @entity84 is @entity2 - born but does not wear a hijab like many other women from the @entity32 republic but the risks are not putting people off			1
the @entity90 of @entity2 who conducted the study in co-operation with @entity94 in the @entity14 found that the rate of nose jobs per capita is seven times that of @entity14 and as prevalent in the the @entity99 as it is in @entity100			1
another anonymous @entity2 woman who had a nose job not long ago told @entity37 : ' i do have a better social life and i do n't have to be ashamed of my big , fat nose anymore			2
' in our family , different types of cosmetic surgery are a totally normal thing , and most of the women and girls have had their noses done			2
' while there are benefits , she confesses ' when i get a cold , i get a runny nose - something fierce			0
i have to be careful then ' .			0
