by @entity0 for @entity1 it seems that a simple face lift or sprinkling of @entity5 just does n't cut it in the quest for perfection that 's gripping our society			1
this year has been all about the bacial ( that 's a bum facial ) , ear - tox ( yes , @entity5 for your ears ) and freckle removal			1

the latest beauty craze may be music to your ears … or more specifically , your earlobes , if you 've always loved dangly earrings			1
ear rejuvenation , also known as ‘ ear - tox ’ , is a new cosmetic surgery procedure which uses dermal fillers injected into the earlobe to plump them back up where heavy earrings may have left them saggy and wrinkled			1
the procedure is proving popular with women over 40 , with many who have had the procedure claiming that it has ' changed their lives '			0
dr. @entity56 , medical director and founder of @entity59 , @entity60 , said : ' women who have n’t had the confidence to wear their hair up for years suddenly have that option			0
i would never have believed that it was possible to make that much difference to their self - esteem until i saw the results myself			2
' for the image - conscious men out there , the newest beauty trend is laser side burn removal , and according to clinics , it ’s becoming increasingly popular			2
is that really necessary ? ear rejuvenation , also known as ' eartox ' , is a new cosmetic surgery procedure which uses dermal fillers injected into the earlobe to plump them back up @entity82 , aesthetic practitioner at @entity83 , @entity84 , said : ' laser hair removal uses light energy to destroy the hair follicle and ensure it does n't grow back			1
we recommend around six treatments for permanent hair reduction			0
' if you are worried about the pain , then do n’t - the popularity of this treatment is a testament to the fact that it is effective and causes minimal discomfort			2
many who have undergone this treatment say that it feels like the snap of a rubber band			0
' ‘ @entity112 ’ is another procedure that aims to cure the most common problem faced by heel - lovers - a condition known as ‘ @entity107 ’ , which occurs when pain hits the soft tissue on the ball of the foot			2
the cure ? botox in the feet			2
some women are even going so far as to have fat inserted into the soles of their feet to allow them to walk more comfortably in heels			2
we like big butts : @entity22 bottoms have been the major cause of envy , and this has resulted in a new bottom enhancing surgery craze that claims to make the derrière ' bouncier ' it is also reported that some have requested ( and been denied ) liposuction on their toes			1
foot fillers have also become increasingly popular among women in a bid to make heels more comfy - adding an extra cushion to the ball of the foot along with so - called ‘ @entity112 ’ , a procedure which alters women ’s feet to improve their appearance			1
if women are n't fretting over their feet , they 're preoccupied with their bottoms			1
@entity147 suffered a humiliating defeat when @entity149 annihilated them 7 - 1 in the semi-finals of @entity152 , but the @entity154 country is a sure winner of the battle of the behinds			2
@entity22 bottoms have been the major cause of envy , and this has resulted in a new bottom enhancing surgery craze			1
renowned for their big , round bottoms , more and more women around the world are opting for cosmetic procedures in order to compete with @entity22 babes			1
dr. @entity168 has noticed a huge surge in popularity from @entity172 ladies at his @entity174 practice			0
he said : ' different people want different bums			0
some want a flatter bum , some want a bigger bum , some want theirs lifted , some want theirs lowered			0
' more and more women all over the world are opting for cosmetic procedures to make their bums big and bouncy just like the @entity22 ; also known as butt sculpting			1
' @entity187 can be achieved by a new machine called @entity189 , which permanently removes fat cells as well as tightening and firming the skin around your butt			0
improving ourselves : it seems that a simple face lift or sprinkling of @entity5 just does n't cut it in the quest for perfection that 's gripping our society - and we are going to extreme lengths to achieve beauty ' i use liposculpting with the @entity189 machine over the lateral parts of the bum , combined with radiofrequency to lift it			1
i also sculpt the saddlebag area and thighs to ensure the bum looks the best it possibly can			0
a lot of practices only sculpt the thigh area , with hopes that it will make the bum look better , but i prefer a more rounded approach - excuse the pun			2
' peels for the face used be all the rage , but now , women have taken to knee peeling			0
many @entity227 women have pink knees , while many women of colour have brown or even greyish areas on their knees , say @entity84 doctors			0
@entity234 , skin specialist at @entity83 explains : ' many people with ethnic skin types may find that areas such as the knees or elbows are slightly darker than the rest of the body and wish to lighten them for a more even skin tone all over			0
this can be due to dryness as well as melanin in the skin			0
' knee peels are also a great way to reduce mild scarring or blemishes on the knees too			0

@entity5 and fillers for your feet will be big news , claim surgeons
we will seek bouncier bottoms like the @entity22
