women should be encouraged to take up ‘ sports ’ like cheerleading and ballet , the sports minister @entity0 has claimed on the day that @entity6 's women won bronze in the curling at the @entity8			1
insisting women did not need to feel ‘ unfeminine ’ while keeping fit , she said it was possible to look ‘ radiant ’ and ‘ absolutely gorgeous ’ while taking part in activities like roller skating and gymnastics			1
but the remarks from @entity16 , who is also an equalities minister , were condemned for focussing on the looks of athletes and not their achievements			2
glamorous : sports and equalities minister @entity0 has suggested cheer leading as a sport for women campaigners have battled to encourage more teenage girls to take part in sports at schools by urging them to shed the need to look good at all times			1
olympic gold medal winner @entity31 has spoken of her classmates ’ reluctance to get ‘ hot and sweaty ’ when competing			0
but miss @entity0 suggested that women could still feel ‘ feminine ’ while competing in glamourous sports			1
‘ there are some wonderful sports which you can do and perform to a very high level and i think those participating look absolutely radiant and very feminine such as ballet , gymnastics , cheerleading and even roller - skating , ’ she told the @entity36			1
miss @entity0 also suggested ballet and rollerskating as sports which women could take part in and still look ' radiant ' miss @entity0 went on : ‘ it ’s having a good spread on offer			1
' for example some girls may well not like doing very traditional hockey , tennis or athletics , others might , so for those who do n’t want to , how about considering maybe gym , ballet , cheerleading ? ’ she said she had watched girls aged 7 - 17 rollerblading at a @entity66 event			1
‘ those girls arrived and they looked absolutely gorgeous			1
‘ they were wearing their socks pulled up , beautiful socks with sequins and their hair was done			0
‘ but my goodness they could skate			0
i felt quite underdressed in my jeans			0
’ the comments are especially damaging coming on the day that @entity77 led @entity80 's women 's curling team to a historic win as they beat @entity82 in the bronze match today			1
the female curling team 's win guaranteed that @entity6 will walk home with the most medals in a @entity8 since 1924			2
@entity77 , the leader of an all - @entity89 team including @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92 , punched the air in delight after she sealed victory with the last stone of the 10th end , keeping her cool to take the point that left the @entity82 empty - handed			0
‘ i am so happy , we are all pushing each other and it makes it more fun to win something , ’ she said			0
tears of joy : @entity6 's skip @entity77 , right , embraces @entity90 after defeating @entity82 to win the women 's curling bronze medal at the 2014 @entity8 face of a winner : captain @entity77 led her team to a 6 - 5 win against @entity82 today team win : @entity6 's @entity92 , left , hugs curling legend @entity113 as the team celebrate winning their match @entity116 , founder of the @entity118 project , insisted miss @entity0 was wrong to focus on the looks of sportswomen and suggest the purpose of sport is to be ' girlie and feminine '			1
“ we should n’t say women should only do sports while they look radiant and beautiful			2
it ’s actually discouraging for a minister to say this			0
it suggests the problem is coming from the young women themselves , when i think a big problem is societal responses			0
' miss @entity0 has stumbled before since being handed the sports brief last october			2
she was left humiliated after she failed to get a single question right in a basic quiz – on sport			0
she did not know the name of the current @entity141 women ’s champion , who won the @entity142 or the name of the @entity145 captain			2
in fact she got all five questions wrong in a quiz on @entity149 , and ended up pleading with the presenter : ‘ come on , help			0
' despite her support for ' feminine ' sports , miss @entity0 herself has a lengthy sporting pedigree			2
she was an under - 16 judo champion for the north of @entity145 and southern @entity89 while at school in @entity158 , and also captained the school 's tennis and hockey teams , as well as being a county - level athlete , cross-country runner , tennis and hockey player			1
a @entity167 spokesman said : ' it is nonsense that the minister suggested women 's participation in sport should be based on looks			1
' the point is that there is a sport or physical activity out there for all women			0
for some it will be tennis or football , for others judo or dance			0
' women decide what they want to do based on their interests and own lives and that choice is up to them			0
