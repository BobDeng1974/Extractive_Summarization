when @entity4 ’s corruption buster @entity2 denounced the report on his own findings , football ’s world governing body must have known they were in trouble			1
and when the day ended with the news that the @entity11 were re-doubling their efforts to investigate @entity4 , it would be fair to say that thursday ’s much - heralded publication of the report into the 2018/2022 bidding process had not gone as @entity4 president @entity16 had anticipated			1
what was so wrong about the report ? the 42 - page summary of an exhaustive year - long investigation alludes to several instances of potential corruption , before concluding on every single bid that they did not ‘ compromise the integrity of the 2018/2022 bidding process ’			1
it also gives @entity4 a clean bill of health			2
@entity2 ( left ) and @entity30 shake hands outside @entity32 in 2012 @entity34 bid team could be punished over 2018 @entity36 efforts ... but @entity37 are cleared to host 2022 event ! @entity41 2018 bid 's computers and emails ' destroyed ' , say @entity4 who is @entity2 ? @entity45 's lowdown on @entity4 investigator @entity4 investigator @entity2 to appeal against his own body 's interpretation of his report into @entity37 and @entity34 bids yet even this report cites several occasions when that appears not to be the case			1
the @entity37 bid sponsored the @entity58 ’s ( @entity57 ) conference for £ 1.15million			1
‘ no bidding rule prohibited sponsorship agreements like the one between @entity37 and @entity57			2
’ which implies the same rules , which have been pronounced ‘ fair and thorough ’ , were hugely deficient			0
is it right to clear @entity37 ? it is impossible to tell			2
even @entity2 ’s fuller investigation was limited in the scope of its inquiry to the point of being almost redundant			0
most @entity4 watchers have always said that @entity37 ’s @entity71 , which hands out grants to developing nations around the world , was the key to currying favour with @entity4 executive committee members			1
and yet the @entity71 merits just one short paragraph			0
@entity37 were named as the host nation for the @entity37 back in 2010 were there other examples of potential corruption ? @entity91 and @entity92 played a friendly in @entity37 in november 2010 , two weeks before the vote , and ‘ an entity wholly owned by a @entity97 business conglomerate financed the event			1
according to ( @entity37 ) bid officials , the entity was unaffiliated with @entity37			1
the financing of the event			0
in particular in relation to certain arrangements concerning payments for the @entity90			0
’ the @entity91 federation president at the time was the late @entity102 , who had a vote on 2022 and who was hugely influential as a senior @entity4 vice-president			1
fans in @entity37 celebrate on the streets as their country are awarded the @entity37 back in 2010 an artist 's impression of how the 45,330 capacity @entity112 stadium located in the north east of @entity37 will look so , did every bidding team cooperate ? no. @entity2 was subjected to a travel ban by the @entity41 government , which meant he could n’t visit the country from april 2013			1
and the @entity41 could provide only ‘ limited ’ documents to the inquiry as the computers they used were ‘ leased ’ and their owner claims he had destroyed them			2
what about the @entity126 ? the report makes excruciating reading with regard to the @entity126 ’s treatment of @entity132 president @entity131			2
@entity34 ‘ often accommodated mr @entity131 in apparent violation of bidding rules ’ and ‘ appeared willing to provide benefits and favours ’ to @entity131 ’s own football team , @entity137 , and ‘ even sought to find employment in the @entity139 for a person of interest to @entity131 ’			2
@entity126 chairman @entity142 called the probe ‘ a joke , a shambles and a complete farce from start to finish ’ @entity34 were criticised for trying to woo former @entity4 vice-president @entity131 will we ever discover what really went on ? probably not			1
even this summary hints that @entity2 ’s inquiry has been frustrated by the limited powers and scope of his investigation			0
it points out frequently that he could not compel witnesses to testify unless they were football officials			0
a persistent theme is that any dirty work is outsourced to individuals , consultants or companies who are not subject to @entity4 regulations			0
‘ to assume that envelopes full of cash are given in exchange for votes on a @entity36 host is naive			0
is executed in much more sophisticated ways			0
’ this document seems to indicate that , if the report were published in full , there are several football officials who could be charged and perhaps suspended by @entity4 ’s ethics commission			1
but you can be sure that @entity4 will never uncover the whole truth			0
we can only hope the @entity11 fare better .			0

@entity4 ethics judge @entity30 *slammed* @entity34 's 2018 bid
@entity37 were named as hosts for 2022 with @entity41 to stage 2018 *edition*
@entity126 chairman @entity142 says @entity4 report is ' a joke '
@entity11 are *stepping* up investigation into alleged @entity4 corruption
