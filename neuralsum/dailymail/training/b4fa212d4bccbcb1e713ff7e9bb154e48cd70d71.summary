@entity0 was the wrong signing for @entity2 because he does n't fit the club 's style of play , says @entity6			1
@entity0 has struggled on @entity7 since his £ 16million move from @entity10 giants @entity9 - scoring just twice in 12 appearances and none in the @entity13			1
the 24 - year - old is struggling to fill the gap left by @entity16 , and former @entity17 favourite @entity6 believes @entity19 ' philosophy is unnatural to @entity0 's game			1
@entity2 striker @entity0 has been disappointing since his £ 16million summer switch from @entity9 @entity6 believes @entity0 ( left ) has struggled to adapt to @entity19 ' philosophy at the club @entity16 scored 31 @entity13 goals for @entity2 under @entity19 last season ' @entity0 is clearly a talented player , but he is not in the bracket of world - class strikers @entity2 need if they are to get near the levels of last season			1
' you might argue that there are not too many around who are , but the biggest surprise for me when @entity2 signed @entity0 is that he was so clearly unsuited to @entity19 ' preferred system , ' he wrote in his column for the @entity36			0
' when you favour a high - intensity , quick - pressing game you have to have your scouts hunting for players who will fit seamlessly into your formation , closing down defenders and covering all areas of the pitch			0
' you know the you are never going to get another @entity16 - that is impossible - but it is important to have someone who at least endeavours to make the same runs and works just as hard			0
@entity0 ( centre ) was on the scoresheet as @entity2 beat @entity54 2 - 1 in the @entity55 on tuesday ' otherwise , as we seem to be seeing on a weekly basis at @entity17 , the manager is is being forced to change his formation , compromising what worked so perfectly last season			2
' it is strange that the new manager has such a clearly defined way of playing and yet some of his players recruited over the summer do not necessarily fit into it			0
' with @entity0 , @entity2 not only took a risk in terms of whether the player would deliver on the pitch - and not get into any trouble off it - but also gambled that he would actually be able to make the transition tactically from what he is used to			2
' i am not so sure that leopards can change their spots			0
