it affects one in 10,000 people , usually aged between two and 10 - in a minority of cases complications lead to organ failure			2
it ’s not known exactly what causes it , but it often seems to follow on from a viral infection , such as a cold or respiratory tract infection , and is more common in the winter months			0
@entity14 is not an inherited disease and is not ‘ catching ’ so it can not be passed on from person to person			1
there are usually three key symptoms			0
the first is a characteristic rash of raised red / purple spots that do not disappear when you press on them			2
it can be very alarming as it ’s similar to the type of rash you see with meningococcal septicaemia			0
the rash is caused by tiny blood vessels ( capillaries ) near the surface of the skin becoming inflamed and damaged , and leaking blood into the skin			0
an @entity14 rash is generally found in the lower part of the body – around the buttocks and lower legs			1
it can also appear on the body , face and hands			0
once the rash has fully appeared it does n’t come and go – it tends to stay for days or even weeks			0
the second symptom is often abdominal pain , often in the form of stomach cramps , nausea and vomiting			0
many children also experience joint pains and blood may appear in the urine			0
unfortunately only the symptoms can be treated			0
but the condition usually settles down within around six weeks and the vast majority of people make a full recovery with no long - term effects			2
the most serious possible consequence of @entity14 is kidney damage			2
for this reason , regular urine tests to monitor kidney function are important , even once someone has recovered			0
