by @entity0 , @entity1 if the hectic pace of life and international travel is getting too much – @entity5 believes it has the answer to calm you down – ‘ @entity8 ’			1
forget the action packed shoot ‘ em up ’ @entity13 blockbusters , the @entity15 - style space epics or break - neck speed car chases			2
@entity5 bosses reckon many passengers while cruising at 600mph and 35,000ft would rather unwind and de-stress on a lengthy flight to the on - screen equivalent of watching paint dry			1
from next week @entity5 are to screen an entire seven - hour - long silent snow - covered train journey from @entity27 to @entity28 in @entity29 so from next week they are to screen an entire seven - hour - long silent snow - covered train journey from @entity27 to @entity28 in @entity29 and believe passengers will appreciate the calming , hypnotic and ‘ mesmerising ’ qualities of the quiet meandering programme that is void of commentary to liven things up			1
@entity5 will be the first airline to air such languid ‘ @entity8 ’ alternative to the usual fare of 130 movies , 650 tv shows , 550 music albums and 228 radio shows			1
they were inspired in part by the popularity of the highly addictive slow - moving in - flight screens which show the aeroplane ’s progress across a map as well as key statistics such as temperature , speed and time			0
the journey - within - a - journey was also inspired by a wider trend for ‘ slow tv ’ which is already popular in @entity58 for its relaxing , undemanding qualities			1
the programmes also feature gentle , everyday events such as knitting , walking and bird feeding			1
for those of a certain vintage , the idea will bring back memories of the highly popular and equally hypnotic spinning ‘ potters ’ wheel ’ – used in the early days of black and white television for the ‘ interlude ’ used between programmes - showing a pair of hands fashioning a clay pot. next in line will be an eight hour epic taking the passenger on a journey to see the entire process of knitting a jumper - from the shearing of sheep to the finished product @entity5 said staff would trial the train journey before expanding to other ‘ slow ’ programmes			1

@entity5 ’s in - flight entertainment manager @entity103 said one of the team at their agency @entity106 read about this unusual documentary that had become a cult hit in @entity29 and tracked it down : ‘ it fits perfectly with the ‘ wallpaper ’ style footage people find mesmerising in - flight , such as our moving maps which customers watch for endless hours			0
highlights include children waving from stations , the changing weather , and stretches of total darkness as the train passes through long tunnels ‘ there ’s definitely a hypnotic , calming and entertaining quality to ‘ @entity8 ’ that is perfect for in - flight entertainment			1
’ the quiet film uses a camera mounted on the front of an ordinary train , and shows its journey through stations , countryside , past picturesque lakes and underneath snow - capped mountains			2
