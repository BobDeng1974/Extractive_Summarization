@entity1 and @entity2 defender @entity0 fears the club may try to sell him in january as manager @entity4 shows no inclination to offer the 30 - year - old defender a new contract			1
@entity0 ’s current deal on an estimated £ 100,000 - a - week runs out at the end of the season and he has yet to hear from the club about a renewal			1
@entity4 brought in two @entity14 full - backs @entity15 and @entity16 in the summer and @entity0 is virtually resigned to not be offered a new contract despite being settled personally on @entity18 after signing for @entity19 in 2009			1
@entity0 , on an estimated £ 100,000 - a - week at @entity1 , fears the club may try to sell him in january young @entity14 full backs @entity16 ( left ) and @entity15 ( right ) were signed in the summer @entity4 has given @entity0 no sign that he will hand him a new contract , which expires next summer with @entity1 one of several clubs under investigation by @entity27 for breaching @entity29 regulations , @entity4 shipped out other @entity19 high - earners @entity30 and @entity32 in the last window			1
the @entity35 club would love to recoup some money on @entity0 in the january transfer window although the player would be entitled to run down his contract and become a free agent in the summer			1
he is free to speak to overseas clubs in the @entity42 if he wanted to emulate his former @entity2 colleague @entity43 who has joined @entity45 club @entity44 on a @entity46			1
@entity0 has recently returned to action after missing six weeks with a thigh injury and comes up against his former manager @entity49 today ( sunday ) as @entity1 travel to @entity51			1
the right - back , capped 54 times by his country , won the @entity55 with @entity56 under @entity49 in 2008 and has sympathy for his old boss who is expected to get the sack if @entity1 win at @entity60			1
@entity0 says there is ' no manager like @entity49 ' , who he once played under at @entity56 @entity0 has struggled with injuries this season and has n't featured much this season @entity66 will be out for at least three weeks ‘ i do n’t think there ’s anyone like him , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i ’ve worked with some very good managers but @entity49 ’s like your mate			2
that ’s why he gets a lot out of players			2
‘ he gets more out of certain people just by making you feel welcome and looking after people every day			2
‘ of course it ’s disappointing if he ’s under pressure			2
it ’s not nice to see anyone maybe losing their job , certainly not someone like @entity49			0
he ’s been a fantastic manager for years and if anyone is going to get @entity51 out of trouble it will be him , so i do n’t know what sacking him would achieve			0
‘ he ’s always been a fantastic manager for me and one of the nicest guys i ’ve ever met			0
when i asked to leave @entity92 and went to @entity56 , @entity49 was a big help to me			0
he gave me the chance to play every week and that ’s what young players need to do			2
‘ when i had a dip in form , @entity49 put a nice little video together , which made a few of the lads laugh			0
it was good banter but it made me realise what i should be doing and i was able to crack on			0
sometimes simple things like that can make a big difference			0
’ after last season ’s unexpected @entity109 title challenge , @entity1 have lost three of their four away games so far this season and struggled to cope with the loss of @entity115 and injury to @entity66 , who is out for a further month with a calf injury			1
@entity49 's @entity51 are bottom of the table and welcome @entity1 to @entity60 on sunday @entity0 admits balancing domestic football with a busy @entity122 schedule has been difficult to come to terms with			1
‘ we only had the @entity109 to concentrate on last season while the other so - called top - four teams were playing games every four days			2
it was easier to keep everyone fit and we almost had our best eleven every week			2
‘ with the game load this season , it is not going to be as simple			0
you will get more injuries and hard to have all the squad out on the training ground			0
we have n’t picked as many results as when we started last season but that is down to the amount of games and losing a few bodies			0
’ @entity1 have a glamour @entity141 fixture coming up against @entity142 at @entity35 on wednesday but @entity0 says they ca n’t afford to think about that yet			1
he added : ‘ we have to treat the next game against @entity51 as the priority			0
we have to make sure we win that and then we can concentrate on @entity142			0
we have to do just as well in the league as we have in the @entity122			0

@entity0 's £ 100,000 - a - week contract runs out next summer
@entity15 and @entity16 have been brought in by @entity1
@entity0 fears club could try to sell him but he may run down deal
