by @entity0 published : 06:28 est , 24 september 2012 updated : 06:31 est , 24 september 2012 a woman who was sexually abused as a child by a family friend has spoken out about her ordeal in court as her attacker was jailed			2
@entity7 , 37 , was just 10 - years - old when she was targeted by @entity8 , now 54 , who befriended her through a church in @entity10 in the 1980s and then abused her			1
now , nearly thirty years later and as @entity8 was jailed for the offences on friday , miss @entity7 has waived her right to anonymity in the hope that it will give others the strength to come forward and report similar offences			1
torment : @entity7 was sexually abused as a child by a family friend who she met at her local church @entity8 , living in @entity22 , @entity10 , at the time of the offences , was so manipulative and cunning that @entity25 had convinced herself he was ' amazing ' and was so confused she believed him to be her first boyfriend			1
at the time miss @entity7 was particularly vulnerable because her parents had split up and she said it ' sickened ' her that @entity8 was the first man she kissed			1
she only found the strength to come forward to police after @entity8 was convicted last year for assaults against other youngsters and was jailed for 46 months			1
shortly before his trial was due to start @entity8 admitted a further 14 counts of sexual activity with children			1
on friday at @entity36 he was jailed for a further 14 months for abuse carried out against @entity25 and three other victims , who can not be named			2

' predator : @entity8 , 54 , was jailed for a further 14 months on top of his 46 months after admitting a further 14 counts of sexual activity with children as well as being jailed he is subject to an indefinite sexual prevention order barring him from working or living with anybody under the age of 16			1
he must also not enter any school premises or playgrounds or loiter within 15 metres			0
he is on the sexual offender register for life			0
the historic nature of the offences meant the judge was bound by old sentencing guidelines			0
had the offences been committed after 2003 the sentence @entity8 would have got would have been significantly higher			1
in court , miss @entity7 took the unusual step of taking the stand to read a statement so that he could hear how his actions had damaged her life			1
she said : ' it sickens me to admit that @entity8 is the first man i kissed and could be considered my first boyfriend			2
' he made me feel special at a time i was very insecure			0
i believed him when he said he was the only one who cared about me			0
' miss @entity7 told the court that after her experiences she had terrible problems with low self - esteem , intimacy , relationships and had abused alcohol and cannabis			1
she said : ' often i would cry myself to sleep or wake up in the middle of the night crying and feeling lonely			1
' i would run away as a coping mechanism thinking it would allow me to start again and get things right but i realised i needed to return to my home city and face my fears			0
' miss @entity7 said she eventually became close to her family again and realised she had to deal with her ' past demons ' and had ' amazing ' support from her family and friends			2
she said : ' i no longer felt alone and decided to work on freeing myself from the demons of my past			0
' i have the strength and courage to deal with anything thrown at me but this is the first time i have been free			0
@entity100 in @entity22 where @entity8 met @entity25 and began to groom her when she was just 10 - years - old ' as strong as i am , he has been the one calling the shots until today			1
i truly hope that hearing this he will realise that after having the power and control he has finally lost it			0
' i have no doubt in my mind that he will not have any remorse for what he has done			0
' @entity110 , prosecuting , said : ' during the 1980s when the defendant was in his 20s or early 30s he was a member of @entity100 in @entity22 and took part in activities			0
' he used this to get in contact with young people aged 10 and 11			0
' the defendant targeted ( @entity7 ) and began to groom her			2
' he later told her that he wanted to announce the relationship but did n’t turn up to the wedding party where he was meant to do so			0
' she was told she must keep it a secret because other people would not understand and said her mother would be upset and would have a breakdown because she would not be able to cope			0
' even after her family moved house when miss @entity7 was 14 or 15 @entity8 visited her , the court heard			1
@entity129 , @entity22 where @entity8 lived in the 1980s at the time of the alleged offences mr @entity110 said she did not make a formal complaint to police for many years but came forward after hearing from family members that he had been jailed for abusing other children between 2005 and 2010			1
mr @entity110 then outlined the abuse suffered by two other girls who had met @entity8 through the church			2
in her victim impact statement one girl said : ' the incidents make me feel sick even to this day			2
