by @entity1 reporter published : 06:55 est , 23 may 2013 updated : 19:26 est , 23 may 2013 teacher : @entity3 messaged the 15 - year - old pupil dozens of times and made clear that she wanted to be ' romantically involved ' a teacher who spent two years trying to seduce a male pupil less than half her age has been banned from every school in the country			1
@entity3 , 35 , pursued the boy from when he was 15 , sending him gifts , texts , @entity15 messages and a letter inviting him to start a ' romantic relationship '			1
she was friends with the boy 's parents , but at one point @entity21 visited the family home when the pupil was there by himself			1
a professional conduct panel heard that the boy tried to telephone his father three times , saying he felt uncomfortable and compromised being alone with the teacher			0
she later texted the pupil to say ' the offer is still open ' , and the boy 's father made an official complaint to the school			2
miss @entity3 , a geography and history teacher at the independent @entity36 in @entity37 , admitted engaging in ' inappropriate behaviour ' beginning in september 2009 , when the pupil was 15			1
she gave him private tuition at her house , and during the summer holiday of 2010 she sent him a letter and a gift			2
in september of that year she visited the boy 's bedroom and asked him whether he wanted to be ' just friends '			1
the same month his father complained to the school , and miss @entity3 received a formal warning			2
but in march 2011 she sent the boy a handwritten letter asking him to begin a ' romantic relationship '			0
she resigned after the boy 's father sent the letter to the school – although she still sent the pupil one further gift			0
the @entity59 professional conduct panel found @entity21 guilty of unacceptable professional conduct , and recommended she should be banned from teaching			0
it found that she had ignored an informal warning in september 2009 that her contact with pupils was inappropriate , as well as the formal warning the following year			1
its report said : ' it is a well - accepted and understood principle , teachers must not establish or seek to establish social contact with pupils , children or young people for the purpose of securing a friendship or to pursue or strengthen a relationship			0
uncomfortable : the @entity76 's report said that ms @entity3 ( pictured ) should have known that the pupil was not comfortable with her advances the teacher had joined @entity80 in september 2009 , and soon embarked on pursuing the pupil ' however , from september 2009 , ms @entity3 sent text and @entity15 messages to the pupil , gave him gifts , visited him at his home and gave him tuition at her home			1
' her conduct was compounded by the fact that it ought to have been apparent to her , at least from september 2010 , that the pupil found her attentions “ uncomfortable ” and that his relationships with his peers were affected because of them			2
' the panel added : ' by acting as she did , ms @entity3 demonstrated a serious lack of professional judgment that had the very real potential not only to damage her own professional reputation but also the reputation of the school and the profession as a whole			2
' the education secretary @entity103 backed the panel 's call for a ban			0
he said : ' the conduct and behaviour of ms @entity3 falls significantly short of that expected of a teacher			0
' the decision means miss @entity3 is banned from teaching in any school , sixth form college , relevant youth accommodation or children 's home in @entity117			1
she may apply for the ban to be set aside , but not until may 2018			0
she has a right of appeal .			0
