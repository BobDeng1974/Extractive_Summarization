it was @entity1 who really pushed me over the edge			1
i mean if there is a better looking example of a 45 year old woman out there , i 'd really love to see it			1
her new video for @entity11 is probably the raciest she 's ever done in her entire career – and she looks better than ever before			2
yes @entity1 's workouts are full of all kinds of complicated @entity16 dancing routines , but she 's been dancing all her life			1
@entity1 puts her recent weight loss down to converting to a vegan diet what is new however , is her diet			1
a few months ago she went vegan and has never looked back			1
actually @entity22 is just the latest celebrity to embrace what is quickly becoming @entity25 's hottest eating plan			0
we all saw the pictures of @entity28 and @entity29 coming out of @entity31 restaurants right after the birth of @entity33 , in fact @entity28 credits veganism with helping her shed 60 pounds of pregnancy weight			1
@entity1 appeared on the cover of @entity38 having lost 10 pounds in a 22 day cleanse despite her allegiance to @entity42 , @entity40 turned to veganism to drop weight on the eve of her wedding			1
other long - time vegans include @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50			1
even the world 's hottest new husband , 50 year old @entity51 is vegan			1
it 's catching on in the @entity55			0
at the moment current estimates are that there are around @entity59 in the @entity55 and in 2013 40 % more tried veganism than the year previously			2
in fact , it 's this diet that @entity64 credits with helping her shed the 10 pounds that had been sticking to her since the birth of her twins six years ago			2
thus , with two stone still sticking to me after the birth of my baby 15 months ago , i decided to try to copy this ultra sexy mother of two			0
the first day at @entity75 's was a complete nightmare			0
i can not handle salads all the time and found trying to meal plan infuriating			0
@entity80 opted for a vegan diet delivery service from my food @entity80 says that she lost 5 pounds almost immediately with the diet service , dishes include sun - dried tomato soup ( left ) and @entity87 red curry ( right ) ensuring that i was getting the right nutrition after cutting out all animal products is challenging , and trying to come up with ideas for meals that actually sound edible to say the least			1
i 'm not a huge fan of the vegetable , i 'll just put that out there now			0
it 's probably part of why i still have so much weight to lose			2
not only that , but if you @entity98 you can find all kinds of experts out there saying that they are a truly horrible idea and bad for your health			0
studies have shown that vegans are often low in vitamins @entity108 , @entity110 and iron for starters			0
in short , cutting out all dairy , eggs and meat means it takes a rather creative type who also happens to have the time to shop for produce , frequently ; neither one of which applies to me			0
@entity123 co-founder of food - state brand @entity124 says , that actually there are pros and cons. ' a healthy vegan diet is a diet plentiful in vegetables and pulses , making it naturally lower processed foods , adulterated fats and higher fibre diet which can support a healthy weight			1
' she adds , however that			0
' like any other dietary regime a vegan diet can easily be unhealthily too if based too much on processed or too many grains , which can lead to weight gain if not eaten in moderation			1
@entity142 tried the vegan craze in an attempt to achieve @entity64 's amazing post baby bod ' any diet where significant food groups are avoided , you run the risk of limiting your intake of key macro and micro nutrients such as @entity110 , iron , chromium and protein , all of which play a fundamental role in metabolism and can therefore reduce your body 's ability to burn ' fuel ' , leading to weight gain and blood sugar imbalance			1
' it 's tricky to get it right			0
two things , in addition to @entity64 's bottom pushed me to give it a shot			0
one was a recent study funded by the @entity173 which showed that vegans have significantly lower rates of cancer than both meat - eaters and vegetarians			2
vegan women , for example , had 34 per cent lower rates of female - specific cancers such as breast , cervical , and ovarian cancer			1
the way they tested it was interesting			0
a series of experiments was performed in which people were placed on different diets and their blood was then dripped on human cancer cells growing in a petri dish			0
women on a vegan diet for just two weeks were found to suppress the growth of three different types of breast cancer			1
it 's believed that it had something to do with changes in the level of a cancer - promoting growth hormone in the body called @entity210			2
animal protein intake increases levels but a plant - based diet cause them to drop			1
then there was a study done by prominent @entity217 physicians drs. @entity215 and @entity219 winner @entity218 ; they found that a vegan diet caused more than 500 genes to change in only three months , turning on genes that prevent disease and turning off genes that cause breast cancer , heart disease , prostate cancer , and other illnesses			1
so there was evidence that indicated i was on a good , healthy track for myself			0
then came the @entity234 solution – or the ' @entity236 ' plan			0
the first week my efforts varied from carb heavy meals – most store bought pasta is made without egg and thus ok - to boring green salads with slimey looking tofu			2
i was this close to giving up when a friend of mine recommended trying a vegan meal delivery service – just until i got the hang of things			2
i used @entity251 ( www.myfood.co.uk ) and my desperate palate was transformed with @entity87 curries , cashew nut paella , vegan ' sushi ' , tofu @entity256 , and spelt pizzas			2
it illustrated that you can have delicious vegan food if you know what you 're doing			2
in the @entity55 vegan diet delivery services are becoming more and more readily available			1
my food founder @entity264 says , ' we have a variety of plans available but recently have been inundated with requests to put together a vegan plan			1
doing it this way takes away some of the fear of not getting enough vitamins and at the same time , shows that you can eat really delicious food – it 's not just all green salads all the time			0
' i lost 5 pounds almost immediately although in the weeks following it 's been more gradual			0
what i have noticed though is that i feel better , i have fewer cravings for sugar and carbs and find that i am actually eating more carbs than usual but still losing weight			2
the still stunning star says she followed a 100 % vegan diet for five weeks and felt incredible			1
' it was a real change , ' she said			0
' i felt better and people were like , ' your energy 's better			0
the truth is , even if you 're 70 - 80 percent vegan , it 's so much better having those vegetables , greens , and plant - based stuff , ' said @entity1			1
' it 's going to change your life and health			0
