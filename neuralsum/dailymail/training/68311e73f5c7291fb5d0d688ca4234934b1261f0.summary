just four pints of lager a week could harm a man ’s chances of having a family , research suggests			1
a study of healthy young men found that drinking just a little more than three pints a week , or half a pint a day , can reduce sperm quality			1
the researchers found the effects occurred when more than 7.5 units of alcohol a week - with the average pint of beer containing around 2.3 units			2
however , many popular lagers are stronger than this			0
for instance , a pint of @entity21 lager contains 2.7 units – meaning that fewer than three pints a week may be harmful			2
the study also found that the more a man drinks , the greater the toll on sperm			1
the @entity28 researchers said that given the large amounts of alcohol drunk by young men , their finding is a public health concern			2
around one in seven couples in the @entity35 has trouble starting a family and male infertility is to blame in almost half of cases			1
some will remain childless , despite spending thousands of pounds on @entity41			0
the study , published in the @entity44 journal , involved 1,200 military recruits aged between 18 and 28			2
they were asked about their drinking habits and gave blood and sperm samples			1
they had drunk 16 units on average the previous week and more than half had binged on booze or been drunk more than twice in the past month			1
boozing was linked to changes in reproductive hormones – and to the health of the men ’s sperm			2
the researchers found that for men who habitually drank heavily there was a clear link between alcohol intake and quality of sperm			1
the more a man drunk , the less sperm he made and the more abnormal it was in shape and size			1
drinking just a little more than three pints a week , or half a pint a day , can reduce sperm quality importantly , the effect was apparent after just 7.5 units a week - although it was particularly strong after 37.5 units a week			1
the @entity76 advises that men do n’t regularly consume more than 21 to 28 units of alcohol a week			0
the @entity81 researchers said that they ca n’t be sure that alcohol is causing the damage			0
for instance , it may be simply be that men with poor sperm are more likely to drink			2
but they warned that even ‘ modest ’ amounts of booze may be harmful – and advised against ‘ high habitual intake ’			0
however , going tee - total may not be the answer			0
the analysis also found that men who did n’t drink at all had poorer sperm than those who had a small amount			0
more research is needed to explain this			0
@entity99 , professor of reproductive medicine at the @entity100 , said : ‘ i think the main message of this paper is clear - high levels of alcohol intake do appear to be associated with changes in sperm and semen that may affect fertility			0
’ professor @entity109 , of @entity110 , described the results as ‘ compelling ’			0
but dr @entity112 , a male fertility expert at the @entity113 , said his own study of infertile men had failed to link boozing with sperm quality			1
however , he said that binge drinking may be more harmful than consuming the same amount of alcohol over a longer period of time .			0

drinking just half a pint a day can harm sperm quality , new study finds
and the more a man drinks , the greater toll there is on his sperm
the more a man drunk , the less sperm he made and more abnormal it was
around one in seven couples in the @entity35 has trouble starting a family
male infertility is to blame in almost half of these cases
