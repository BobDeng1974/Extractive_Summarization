a @entity1 politician who sparked an international row after claiming the use of sex slaves during @entity5 was justified has tried to shift the blame by accusing other country 's of using the same practice			1
@entity10 mayor @entity9 , co-leader of an emerging nationalist party , argued @entity1 's wartime practice of forcing @entity14 women into prostitution was necessary to maintain military discipline and provide relaxation for soldiers			1
but following the public outcry over his comments , the mayor has attempted to deflect criticism by accusing @entity23 and @entity24 of using sex slaves for its own soldiers			1
shifting the blame : @entity30 deputy president and @entity10 mayor , @entity9 , claims @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity32 , @entity33 and the @entity34 used sex slaves disgraceful : four ' @entity36 ' captured in the hills of @entity38 , play mahjong during recess period in woman 's detention home on outskirts of @entity45 girls were part of a group which rotated among various @entity1 battalions investigation : a young @entity51 woman who was in one of the @entity54 's ' comfort battalions ' is interviewed by an @entity56 officer he said : ' it is a hard truth that even these nations used local women for sexual reasons			1
this is a historical fact and there is hard evidence that proves it was true			0
' historians say up to 200,000 women , mainly from the @entity67 and @entity51 , were forced to provide sex for @entity1 soldiers in military brothels			2
while some other @entity5 armies had military brothels , @entity1 is the only country accused of such widespread , organized sexual slavery			0
@entity9 , a lawyer and former tv personality , created an uproar with comments to journalists two weeks ago about @entity1 's modern and wartime sexual services , which he said were misquoted			1
he is reported to have said : ' to maintain discipline in the military , it must have been necessary at that time			0
draw : in this undated image @entity23 sailors gather in front of a @entity86 ' comfort station ' in @entity87 , south of @entity88 @entity5 : a @entity1 militray unit , consisting of @entity91 wrestlers , engage in drills and training exercises as a prelude to induction into the home defense forces , @entity1 , 1942 ' for soldiers who risked their lives in circumstances where bullets are flying around like rain and wind , if you want them to get some rest , a comfort women system was necessary			1
that â€™s clear to anyone			0
' he added that on a recent visit to the southern island of @entity110 , he suggested to the @entity23 commander there that his troops ' make better use ' of the legal sex industry ' to control the sexual energy of those tough guys			2
' @entity9 has since claimed he had not tried to condone a system of so - called comfort women , but meant to say military authorities at the time , not only in @entity1 but in many other countries , considered it necessary			1
' comfort woman ' is a translation of the @entity1 euphemism , jugun ianfu , ( military comfort women ) , referring to women of various ethnic and national backgrounds and social circumstances who became sex slaves for the @entity1 troops before and during @entity5			1
forgotten women : @entity9 failed to mention the @entity51 , @entity134 , and @entity136 women also exploited as sex slaves during @entity137 , @entity134 former - comfort women march in 2004 to protest their wartime abuse outraged : former ' comfort woman ' @entity140 ( left ) stands beside her supporters holding portraits of @entity51 , @entity134 , @entity143 and @entity145 comfort women who were sex slaves @entity9 also claims singling out @entity1 is wrong , alleging the issue also existed in the armed forces of the @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity32 , @entity33 and the @entity34 during @entity137 ' based on the premise that @entity1 must remorsefully face its past offenses and must never justify the offenses , i intended to argue that other nations in the world must not attempt to conclude the matter by blaming only @entity1 and by associating @entity1 alone with the simple phrase of " sex slaves " or " sex slavery " , ' @entity9 said in a statement to journalists			1
but the mayor did apologise to for saying @entity23 troops should patronize adult entertainment businesses as a way to reduce sex crimes			2
@entity9 's suggestion to the @entity23 troops brought sharp criticism from @entity167			1
the @entity168 called @entity9 's comments ' outrageous and offensive			2
painful past : a @entity143 woman cries during a protest rally at the @entity1 embassy in @entity174 , where demonstrators demanded compensation and punishment for soldiers who abused women sense of crisis : @entity9 made the comments because of a ' sense of crisis ' over sex crimes committed by @entity23 soldiers stationed in @entity110 , where there has been a @entity23 military presence ever since @entity5 @entity110 was invaded by @entity23 forces in @entity5 and has had an @entity23 military presence since			1
the 1995 rape of a schoolgirl by two @entity193 and a sailor spread rage across the island , and more rapes and other crimes linked to @entity23 servicemen over the years , along with military land use and aircraft noise , have caused longstanding anti- @entity23 military sentiment there			0
@entity9 said his remarks rose from a ' sense of crisis ' about the cases of sexual assaults by @entity23 military personnel on @entity1 civilians in @entity110 , where a large number of @entity23 troops are based under a bilateral security treaty			1
' i understand that my remark could be construed as an insult to the @entity23 forces and to the @entity23 people ' and was inappropriate , he told a news conference at the @entity218 in @entity88			0
' i retract this remark and express an apology			0
' ' comfort woman ' is a translation of the @entity1 euphemism , jugun ianfu , ( military comfort women ) , referring to women of various ethnic and national backgrounds and social circumstances who became sex slaves for the @entity1 troops before and during @entity5			1
military brothels existed across the @entity232 in areas occupied by the @entity1 forces			0
there is no way to determine precisely how many women were forced to serve as comfort women , but estimates range from 80,000 to 200,000 , of whom about 80 per cent of whom are thought to have been @entity143			0
some of the girls forced into sexual slavery were as young as 12 years old , according to @entity51 legal groups			0
an ' inexcusable act ' : historians estimate that the @entity1 military forced up to 200,000 women to act as prostitutes during @entity5 @entity1 women and women of other occupied territories ( such as @entity145 , the @entity134 , @entity136 , @entity253 and the @entity254 ) were also used as comfort women , according to a report by @entity257			2
the authorities believed the comfort system would enhance the morale of the military and help prevent soldiers from committing sexual violence toward women of occupied territories , which became a real concern after the infamous @entity266 in 1937			0
they were also concerned with the health of the troops , which prompted close supervision of the hygienic conditions in the comfort stations to help keep stds under control			0
when the war ended , the only military tribunal concerning the sexual abuse of comfort women took place in @entity281 ( now @entity281 , the capital of @entity136 ) in 1948			0
several @entity1 military officers were convicted for having forced the 35 @entity285 women involved in the case into comfort stations			2
the issue began to emerge in @entity289 only in the late 1980s			0
the @entity1 government admitted deception , coercion and official involvement in the recruitment of comfort women in august 1993 , but critics said they needed to go much further			2
after @entity1 's surrender it is reported that it set up a similar system there for @entity23 gis , with tacit approval from @entity23 authorities , @entity1 officials visited a @entity305 town in april 2012 to ask for a memorial to the thousands of @entity143 women and girls who were enslaved to be removed .			1
