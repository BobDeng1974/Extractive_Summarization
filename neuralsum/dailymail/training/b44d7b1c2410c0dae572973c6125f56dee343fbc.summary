by @entity0 published : 23:40 est , 17 october 2013 updated : 07:20 est , 18 october 2013 as the old stereotype goes , @entity2 people are always first to bag the sun loungers , and always last to say thank you			1
the @entity6 , which is @entity2 's equivalent of the @entity8 , claims that a number of factors could explain away the stereotype			1
famed for their punctuality , they also have a reputation for getting straight to the point - which can be perceived as rude by the @entity15			0
because of the nation 's fractured past , @entity2 hold stability , structure and order in high regard			1
the @entity6 have produced a video which explain the misconceptions - and how @entity2 differ from people of different nationalities			1
in the clip , a @entity2 man is seen standing upright and to attention with a handful of documents while the foreigner - possibly @entity15 - sits in a slouched position			0
@entity43 of the @entity45 branch of the @entity6 told website @entity47 : ' we produced the films as a starting point of a discussion about cultural differences when doing business with @entity2			0
' she added : ' the video - makers attribute @entity2 ' tendency to avoid personal matters in favour of getting straight to the point to history			2
' they say the historic division of @entity2 into several smaller states meant @entity2 were constantly surrounded by enemies and they kept themselves to themselves			0
' but @entity43 told @entity47 that the mention of @entity2 being surrounded by enemies was not a reference to the @entity68 and that there had been some criticism of that part of the video .			2

@entity2 like ' stability and structure ' because of nation 's fractured past
