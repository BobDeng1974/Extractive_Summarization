the disease is thought to kill cells in the eyes at the same time as it kills cells in the brain			2
this means it may be possible to spot dementia via an easy and inexpensive test at an optician ’s			0
@entity4 ’s and other forms of dementia affect more than 800,000 @entity20 and the number is expected to double in a generation as the population ages			2
techniques used in diagnosis , including memory tests and brain scans , are far from perfect and definitive proof only comes on examining the brain after death			1
simplifying and speeding up diagnosis could mean that many more people get the help they need			0
@entity34 researchers capitalised on the fact that the retina , the light - sensitive ‘ film ’ at the back of the eye , is a direct extension of the brain			2
it is also the only part of the brain that is readily accessible			0
in tests on mice , layers of the retina were up to 49 per cent thinner in animals genetically - engineered to develop @entity4 ’s , compared with healthy creatures of the same age			1
researcher @entity51 , of @entity52 in @entity53 , said : ‘ the retina is an extension of the brain , so it makes sense to see if the same pathologic processes found in an @entity4 ’s brain are also found in the eye			1
’ it is thought that when brain cells die in @entity4 ’s , leading to shrinking of the organ , they also die in the eye , leading to thinning of the retina			1
dr @entity51 told the @entity66 ’s annual conference in @entity67 , @entity68 , that the research is still at an early stage and he still has to prove that the same thing happens in people			0
if it does , it may be possible to use equipment already used to detect other eye conditions to spot @entity4 ’s			2
@entity4 's and other forms of dementia affect more than 800,000 @entity20 and the number is expected to double in a generation as the population ages			1
image shows ct scans of a brain with @entity4 's the eye scan could also be given to track how well a drug is working – or even to predict who is going to develop the disease in years to come			1
dr @entity51 said : ‘ changes in the brain are found ten to 20 years before the onset of dementia			0
retinal thinning may similarly predict impending alzheimer ’s disease but this is speculation so far			0
’ those given early warning could change their diet or do more exercise in an attempt to keep their brain healthy for as long as possible			0
dr @entity102 , of @entity103 , said : ‘ there is increasing evidence linking a loss of retinal cells to alzheimer ’s disease , and it ’s positive to see this line of research being followed up			0
‘ this early - stage study , which is yet to be published in full , was carried out in mice , and further research will be necessary to determine whether changes in the retina found here are also found in people with @entity4 ’s			1
‘ diagnosing @entity4 ’s with accuracy can be a difficult task , which is why it ’s vital to continue investing in research to improve diagnosis methods			0
’ in tests on mice , layers of the retina were up to 49 per cent thinner in animals genetically engineered to develop @entity4 's , compared to healthy creatures of the same age dr @entity128 , of the @entity129 , said : ‘ it would be great if we could simply look into someone ’s eyes to see if they had @entity4 ’s but unfortunately spotting the disease is a lot more complicated than that			1
‘ this study builds on existing evidence linking the loss of cells in the eyes to dementia but , whilst a link could provide a useful and non-invasive aid to diagnosis , it ’s important to stress that this study looked at mice and therefore the results may not be the same in people			0
‘ much more research needed in humans so that we can spot @entity4 ’s early and stop the disease in its tracks			2

currently @entity4 can only be diagnosed for certain by studying a *patient* 's brain after their death - other techniques involve memory tests
layers of the retina are 49 *%* thinner in mice with @entity4 's disease
*suggests* processes occurring in a brain with dementia also occur in the eye
if the same is true in humans , an eye test could indicate if a person has dementia and whether drug treatments are working
