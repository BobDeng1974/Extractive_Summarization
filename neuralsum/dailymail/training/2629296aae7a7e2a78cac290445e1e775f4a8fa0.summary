by @entity0 a traffic warden has been caught on film apparently refusing to ticket a car parked on double yellow lines - and eventually admits that it 's because it belongs to his own boss			1
the warden , who was on patrol in @entity11 , @entity12 , was confronted by an indignant member of the public who noticed that one car had escaped punishment			1
@entity17 , who filmed the encounter on his phone , asked the warden repeatedly why he had refused to ticket the car , to which the flustered official replied that he was acting on his ' discretion '			1
eventually another warden entered the fray , and revealed another reason the ticket was allegedly withheld , saying ' that 's my boss 's car '			1
a second video filmed by mr @entity17 then shows the man in question - @entity48 deputy manager @entity47 - entering the argument			1
' on business ' : a second warden , left , later points out that the car belongs to his boss @entity47 , right , who then arrives and attempts to defend himself the suited man - who identifies himself as mr @entity47 when asked - attempts to explain that he is parking there for business reasons , which mr @entity17 tells him is not a valid reason			1
he initially compares himself to the police - who are allowed to disregard parking laws in certain circumstances - but later gives up on the line of argument			0
when asked whether his logic applied to anybody who has business reasons for parking on double yellow lines , mr @entity47 does not give a clear answer , but seems to leave the confrontation seemingly without a ticket			0
@entity74 was not available to comment			0
part one : confrontation and @entity76 @entity17 : how come you just allowed somebody to park on double yellow lines ? warden 1 : i 've got discretion ... that 's for me to know ... it 's privileged information , sir			1
. i 'm allowed to give discretion for people			0
mr @entity17 : i disagree , sir , because that 's not fair ... we 're all equal people , you have no right to leave that vehicle parked there			2
part two : the truth emerges mr @entity17 : i 'm just asking the question - how come you 've allowed that car to park there for more than five minutes on double yellows and then walked away from the situation ? warden 2 : what ? that car there ? that 's my boss 's car			1
mr @entity17 : it does n't matter whether it 's your boss 's car , does it ? warden 2 : i think you 'd better go speak to him yourself , sir			1
part three : ' @entity117 ' mr @entity17 : how come you 're allowed to park on double yellow lines for more than five minutes ? mr @entity47 : i 'm actually on business at the moment			2
mr @entity17 : that does n't matter ... why is it fair for you to park on business and not me ? mr @entity47 : it depends on what you 're doing			2
mr @entity17 : but no , it does n't			0
part four : the admission mr @entity47 : all right , i should n't have really parked there			0
mr @entity17 : i just do n't think that 's fair			2
part five : the last - ditch attempt warden 1 : i 'm using my discretion			0
mr @entity17 : you 're not a police officer , sir , you have a job to follow and if you 're not doing it and booking this car you 're in breach of your own rules and regulations			0
part six : the @entity146 mr @entity17 : police have discretion , they are allowed to park on double yellow lines if they have blue lights on			2
do you have blue lights on top of this vehicle ? mr @entity47 : no. mr @entity17 : are you a police officer ? mr @entity47 : no. mr @entity17 : you 're a manager who 's high up within the parking industry			0
i think it 's despicable .			0

man in @entity11 , @entity12 , *spotted* a car which had not been ticketed
confronts *nearby* warden who appears to refuse to give a ticket
the warden - who is not named - *claims* that he is acting on his ' discretion '
@entity17 , who filmed the video , insists that he has no right to do that
another warden then *interjects* and identifies the car as his boss 's
the boss in question then emerges and attempts to defend himself
he eventually admits he was *wrong* to park there - but still gets no ticket
