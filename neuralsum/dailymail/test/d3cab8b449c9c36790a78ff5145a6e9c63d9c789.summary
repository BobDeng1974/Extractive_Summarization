few people can fail be wowed by technicolor butterfly wings that ' sparkle ' in the sunlight			1
and now a photographer has captured the finer details of these iridescent insects in stunning clarity , including the rainbow scales of their delicate wings			2
some look like exotic bird feathers and colourful ribbon , while others resemble jagged autumnal leaves that change colour at the outer edges			0
as well as the beautiful colours , they show the layout of individual scales , which give the insect its iridescence			0
this image shows the wing of a sunset moth the photos were shot by @entity33 from @entity34 , who combines his love of photography with a phd in biochemistry			1
the 51 - year - old uses a modified microscope and a camera to capture the detail of the butterfly 's wing pattern			1
his photographs show the pretty insects ’ scale - covered wings			2
butterfly wings are covered by thousands of microscopic scales split into two to three layers , which gives them their @entity54 order name of lepidoptera - meaning scaled wings			1
each scale is pigmented with melanins that give butterflies black and brown colouring , but eye - catching blues , greens , reds and iridescence are created by the microstructure of the scales , rather than pigments themselves			0
some of the scales look like exotic bird feathers , while others resemble autumnal leaves that change colour at the outer edges , such as this beautiful image of a detached scale from a tiger swallowtail the tiny scales combine to give the striking colouration of the @entity81 ( stock image )			0
it is a species of swallowtail butterfly native to eastern @entity84 and is one of the most familiar butterflies in the eastern @entity87 , where it is common in many different habitats each scale of a butterfly is pigmented with melanins that give butterflies black and brown colouring , but eye - catching blues , greens , reds and iridescence ( pictured ) are created by the microstructure of the scales , rather than pigments			1
a papilio blumei fruhstorferi wing is shown the brighter colours on some butterflies are created thanks to the scattering of light by the scales , such as these jagged examples , which are @entity108 ulysees butterfly scales			2
in fact , each scale has multiple layers which are separated by air , so when light hits them it 's reflected many times and the combination of these reflections causes us to see the intense yellows and blues of many butterfly species the brighter colours are created thanks to the scattering of light by the scales , which are layered in different patterns on top of each other			1

some butterflies even reflect ultraviolet light , which is unable to be seen by humans			0
the ability of @entity142 butterflies to detect ultraviolet light helps them on their annual migration from @entity84 to @entity147 , for example			0
mr @entity33 said : ' i 've always taken macro photographs of insects , moths and butterflies			2
i have a lifelong interest in exploring the world beyond what the unaided human eye can see			0
‘ this led me to use research quality microscopes and combining the two skills			0
’ he uses a trinocular - reflecting light microscope fitted with @entity164 s - plan objectives , or attachments , and takes the photographs using a @entity167 , which is fitted to the top of the microscope			1
the microscope has also been modified by adding a @entity171 stepping motor and controller to drive the focusing control , meaning very small steps can be made in the focusing stage			0

' this close - up image shows scales on the wings of the monarch butterfly mr @entity33 imaged the @entity186 's wings in minute detail			1
the moth ( pictured left ) flies during the day and is considered one of the most impressive and appealing - looking lepidopterans			2
he also captured the wings of the monarch butterfly ( stock image shown right ) , which is the most familiar @entity84 butterfly species he uses a trinocular - reflecting light microscope fitted with @entity164 s - plan objectives , or attachments , and takes the photographs using a @entity167 mark ii. this camera is fitted to the top of the microscope			1
overlapping pale blue scales are pictured the depth of field in a single microscope image is too small to see the whole of the butterfly in one image , so mr @entity33 takes up to 200 separate images spaced by one micron intervals to capture the creatures			1
these images are then combined into a single imaging using focus stacking software , resulting in pictures that are sharp and in full focus			0
' the pictures are stunningly beautiful and they make me realise how lucky i am to be able to capture the intricate structure of butterflies , ’ mr @entity33 continued			0
' often people think they are fabric and appear very surprised when they find out they are the scales which look like dust which they remember experiencing when they touched a butterfly as a child			0

this image shows the wing of @entity234 parhassus - known as the ' forest mother of pearl - a butterfly that lives in forests in @entity239			1

the stunning photos of the butterfly wings were taken by 51 - year - old @entity33 from @entity34
he used a trinocular - reflecting light microscope with a @entity167 camera is fitted to the top
images include close - up shots of the *peacock* swallowtail , a sunset moth and the mother of pearl butterfly
