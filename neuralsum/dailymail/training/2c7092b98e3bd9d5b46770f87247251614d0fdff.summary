devoted : @entity0 , whom @entity1 married aged 41 on the news of @entity6 ’s death , his one - time cabinet colleague @entity2 said he felt ‘ very sad ’			1
‘ a good and honourable servant of his country			1
a decent and lasting friend			2
he will be sorely missed			2
rip , ’ he said			2
it did not take long , though , for a very different reaction to emerge			2
first , the @entity15 mp @entity14 replied to lord @entity2 ’s tweet with a single word : ‘ hmmm			2
’ then another @entity19 user publicly added a message declaring @entity21 ‘ a nasty little pederast ’			1
over the next few hours , a torrent of vile abuse was directed , via @entity19 , at @entity6			1
hundreds of messages , often from people who ‘ follow ’ mr @entity14 on @entity19 and at times so obscene as to be unprintable , were sent , accusing the former @entity28 home secretary of having committed a catalogue of appalling sex crimes			1
many expressed glee at his death and hoped that he ‘ rots in hell ’			1
the vehemence of such remarks , often made anonymously , was entirely at odds with the fact that @entity6 was never charged with any criminal offence , let alone convicted			1
yet we are living in the internet age , where mob mentality rules , and there is scant regard for traditions of politeness , let alone the old - fashioned notion that a man should be considered innocent until proven guilty			2
so it was that @entity6 was forced to live out his final years under a black cloud , the subject of seemingly never - ending rumours about his alleged involvement in a paedophile ring , which operated at the heart of the @entity58 establishment			1
recent months had , among other things , seen him investigated for supposedly ‘ burying ’ a dossier detailing vip child abusers , questioned by police over an alleged rape and accused in @entity65 of ‘ improper conduct with children ’			1
increasingly frail , having spent time in hospital over christmas 2013 , when he was treated for heart trouble and cancer , the old man retreated behind the net curtains of his five - storey home in @entity81 ’s @entity80 , attended by his loyal wife , @entity82 , step - daughters @entity68 and @entity70 , and his 81 - year - old brother , @entity71			2
his final public statement was , perhaps fittingly , made via @entity84 , the former lawyers of @entity82 , @entity86			2
issued last july after a woman claimed he ’d raped her during a blind date in 1967 , it read : ‘ it is true that i have been questioned by the police about a serious allegation made against me			2
this allegation is wholly without foundation			2
’ the woman , a @entity15 member , was a 19 - year - old student at the time she claims she was assaulted almost 50 years ago			2
downcast : @entity6 last year after being questioned by police about serious allegations we can reveal that she first went to the police in late 2012			2
but after a lengthy investigation , detectives decided there was insufficient evidence even to question @entity6			0
they were forced to reverse that decision last june , however , after @entity15 ’s @entity14 , who was in contact with the woman , complained about it in a letter to the @entity113			0
@entity6 was interviewed under caution , but not arrested			0
details of the case were made public only after they were leaked to the left - wing @entity117 on sunday newspaper			0
a file was subsequently passed to the @entity121			0
but there was insufficient evidence for any hope of securing a conviction and no charges were filed			0
nonetheless , the rumour mill — mostly , it seems , politically motivated — continued to churn			0
@entity14 was often at its centre , as the man originally responsible for kick - starting the wider scandal in which @entity6 became embroiled			0
it had begun in october 2012 , when the campaigning @entity15 mp made an extraordinary speech in the @entity135 asking @entity136 about claims of a ‘ powerful paedophile network linked to @entity65 and @entity139 ’			1
three months later , @entity140 launched @entity141 , an investigation into a vip paedophile ring said to have included a number of prominent figures , which had operated at the @entity141 , a gay brothel in @entity147 , @entity81 , in the @entity148			1
as part of the inquiry , detectives raided a property in central @entity81 and took away a number of documents that purported to name a string of prominent visitors to the address , including two pop stars , a royal servant , an @entity161 officer , @entity164 traitor @entity162 and @entity166 mp @entity165 ( posthumously exposed as a child abuser )			0
but is it really credible that a senior minister , with 24 - hour special branch protection , could slip his security cordon and carry out child sex abuse ? yet , in cyberspace , dozens of websites sprang up alleging that @entity6 was guilty of a string of sex crimes over several years			1
invariably , such claims were ( and remain ) unsupported by fact			1
the websites can not , for example , find victims prepared to testify on the record or produce documentary evidence that has anything approaching a reliable provenance			0
occasionally , lurid reports have spilled over into the mainstream press			0
in late 2013 , for example , the @entity188 claimed that an unnamed ‘ former @entity28 cabinet minister ’ had been photographed and filmed at a ‘ depraved orgy organised by a paedophile ’			1
' lasting friend ' : @entity3 , @entity194 and @entity6 at @entity194 's wedding the police had copies of the pictures and video , the article suggested , and would shortly be questioning the former minister			1
yet no such interview is believed to have taken place			0
no arrests were made , and no charges filed — which , on the face of it , would seem unlikely if such damning pictures exist			0
another wild allegation circulating online — and reported by the @entity210 — is that while serving as a cabinet minister , a @entity28 was once arrested by @entity213 officials for smuggling child pornography in his luggage			0
you can look in vain for evidence to support this outlandish charge			0
dark cloud : rumours about @entity21 were circulating around @entity223 from the earliest days of his career			1
above , @entity6 with @entity226 one thing we know for sure , meanwhile , is that in 1984 @entity6 was , as home secretary , handed a ‘ dossier ’ alleging the existence of a paedophile ring at @entity223 by the late @entity28 mp , @entity232			1
the dossier later disappeared , prompting endless rumours that @entity6 presided over its cover - up			1
though he initially denied ever having seen the documents , last year he made a formal statement to the effect that he had passed @entity232 ’s dossier to officials			0
‘ i do not recall being contacted further about these matters by @entity245 officials , by mr @entity232 or by anyone else , ’ he said			0
the fate of that dossier is one of many issues due to be investigated by the government ’s inquiry into historic sex abuse , if it ever gets off the ground			1
indeed , its existence led to the resignation in october of inquiry chair @entity257 , after it emerged that she had a personal friendship with @entity6 ’s wife			0
largely lost in that controversy , however , was a pertinent fact : if @entity6 had been part of the @entity223 paedophile ring laid bare by the ‘ dossier ’ , why would @entity232 hand that dossier to him ? dark rumours about @entity21 were , it must be noted , circulating around @entity223 from the earliest days of his career			1
a single man when he entered @entity65 in 1974 , he had no known girlfriends before marrying aged 41			0
in 1984 , @entity6 was at the centre of another poisonous rumour during which several newspapers reported that an unnamed frontbencher was a predatory paedophile			1
the so - called ‘ cabinet minister scandal ’ died down when the investigative journalist @entity277 published an article in private eye that named @entity6 and said untrue rumours had been circulating ‘ around in @entity281 ’ about him for some time			1
after lengthy investigations , several newspapers , including the @entity284 , had concluded there was nothing in them			0
vicious : in 1984 , @entity6 was at the centre of another poisonous rumour during which several newspapers reported that an unnamed frontbencher was a predatory paedophile			1
above , with his wife @entity82 @entity279 said the rumours were a smear circulated by @entity161 officers who had targeted @entity21 because they were upset by reports claiming he was planning a ‘ big shake - up ’ of their operations following the fatal shooting of @entity299 outside the @entity301 embassy			1
there was also prejudice against @entity21 because of his @entity308 faith			0
@entity279 concluded : ‘ the @entity161 spooks and loonies who object to having a @entity308 home secretary			0
[ have ] retaliated by resurrecting the @entity21 smear and spreading it around the @entity313			0
’ thirty years on , such smears refuse to go away — and have been lent oxygen by the internet			0
to add to @entity6 ’s pain in his final months , @entity15 mp @entity317 used commons privilege ( which protects mps from libel ) last october to accuse him of ‘ improper conduct with children ’ during the miners ’ strike			0
mr @entity317 cited no evidence in support of such claims			0
throughout this barrage of allegations , one may wonder : why have n’t all the victims come forward to testify to @entity6 ’s guilt ? the fact is they have largely been conspicuous by their absence .			1

hundreds of messages on @entity19 expressed glee at @entity341 's death
many accused him of having committed catalogue of appalling sex crimes
remarks were at odds with the fact he was never charged with any offence
but rumours hung over him about alleged involvement in paedophile ring
