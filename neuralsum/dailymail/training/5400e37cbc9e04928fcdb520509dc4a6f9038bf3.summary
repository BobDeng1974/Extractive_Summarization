this is the adorable moment a three - year - old @entity2 fanatic throws a tantrum when she learns her new school uniform is blue			1
@entity6 was getting ready for her first day at school in @entity8 when her mother , @entity9 , handed her the royal blue cardigan			1
the toddler quickly breaks down in tears , refusing to sport the colours of her team 's arch rivals , @entity14			2
after pleading with the child that @entity2 sometimes wears a blue away strip , ms @entity33 and her partner @entity31 admit defeat			2
' i knew she was n't going to be happy			0
she just loves @entity2 , she is such an avid fan and loves everything to do with them			1
it 's always @entity2 , @entity2 , @entity2 , ' said the 28 - year - old bank worker			1
' we went to buy the uniform earlier this week and we thought once she had it on we might be able to talk her round			0
' it was a nightmare , i do n’t know how we ’re going to get on when it ’s her first day at school because she ’s not changing her mind			0
i do n’t think it ’s going to be easy			0
' it ’s tough to see my little girl upset but i ’m sure she ’ll get used to the new uniform			0
she ’s so passionate about @entity2 and i think the video ’s brilliant , i hope it ’s something which will make other people smile as well			2
@entity59 fan : the toddler 's mother said she knew getting her into the blue uniform would be difficult eventually @entity6 begins to calm down but is not easily talked out of her objections to the uniform her mother tries everything to make her come round to the colour , and gently reminds her that even @entity2 wears blue sometimes too the toddler will have to wear the grey and blue uniform when she joins school later this month			1
unsurprisingly , her favourite outfit is her red home strip ( right ) which she pairs with matching @entity76 ' most of my family are @entity14 fans , it ’s just me and my sister that are @entity2			1
' they ’ve all seen the video and they all think it ’s quite funny , they ’d much rather she was a @entity85			0
' @entity6 does n’t have a favourite @entity2 player as she ‘ loves them all the same ’ and unsurprisingly lists her @entity2 shirt as her favourite item of clothing			2
she will be joining the school ’s ‘ @entity91 ’ pre-school class later this month .			0

@entity6 , three , is *distraught* when she sees royal blue cardigan
