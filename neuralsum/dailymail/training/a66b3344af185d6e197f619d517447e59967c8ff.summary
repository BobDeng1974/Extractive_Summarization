by @entity0 for the @entity1 price promise : @entity3 said he would freeze gas and electricity bills in the @entity6 the boss of one of the biggest energy companies has said it would be too risky to cut prices ahead of winter because of @entity13 ’s threatened price freeze			1
@entity14 , head of @entity15 , said the firm had not reduced fuel bills despite a slump in wholesale prices – as an election victory for @entity3 would see them forced to stick with the new tariffs for 20 months			1
critics last night said it showed @entity13 ’s price freeze promise – which it heralded as the key part of its drive to help struggling families cope with increased living costs – had backfired spectacularly			1
so far this year , wholesale gas prices , which make up nearly half of energy bills , have fallen by more than 50 per cent			2
but in a letter to the energy regulator @entity33 , mr @entity14 , whose company supplies 3.5million households , said @entity13 ’s proposal had made it impossible to lower prices			1
‘ the potential @entity13 price freeze has , of course , also complicated all pricing decisions further , ’ he wrote			1
‘ the political and media pressures at the moment make it more difficult to reduce prices and then increase them again next spring			0
then we are acutely aware that if the @entity13 were to implement their proposed price freeze , we will be living with the consequences of our standard tariff price for a very long time and beyond the level of risk that we could manage in the wholesale market			1
’ he added : ‘ however , i can assure you that we review prices regularly and assess our options on a monthly basis			0
’ the correspondence , which was written in june but has only now been made public , came after @entity33 wrote to suppliers asking why price drops had not been passed on to customers			0
last september , mr @entity3 said he would freeze gas and electricity bills in the @entity6 for 20 months if he wins the general election in may next year			2
the commitment is credited with keeping his party high in the opinion polls , although new research claims it has wiped billions off the value of shares in energy firms			0
and conservative politicians last night said that bills are likely to be artificially inflated all through next winter because of the proposed price freeze			1
some @entity80 analysts had already warned that @entity13 ’s policy would backfire , and the admission from the energy boss suggests they were right			2
@entity84 , @entity85 mp for @entity86 and @entity87 , said : ‘ clearly @entity3 ’s policy has backfired and is driving up energy bills today at a time when people can least afford it			2
instead of making things easier , they are making them worse			0
@entity14 , head of @entity15 , said @entity3 's promise had ' complicated all pricing decisions ' for energy bills			1
wholesale prices have dropped by 50 per cent but the company has not shifted its tariff ( file picture ) ‘ @entity13 do not have an economic plan or credible policies			1
they are not fit to govern			0
’ @entity104 , @entity85 mp for @entity105 , added : ‘ people have not had a reduction in energy bills and will not get one because of @entity13 before they are even in power			2
if @entity3 is elected it will lead to energy shortages			0
@entity13 ’s energy price freeze is a false promise , and before they have even had a whiff of power it has backfired			1
’ last night @entity13 defended its policy			0
energy spokesman @entity116 said : ‘ all the energy companies have 101 excuses about why they wo n’t cut their prices , but if @entity15 are publicly admitting that they are keeping their prices artificially high and the government is doing nothing about it , that shows exactly why we need reform of the energy market			0
’ mr @entity3 has previously suggested that a @entity13 government could possibly seek control over other markets , fuelling speculation that @entity13 might step in to regulate water , rail and petrol .			0
