@entity0 bought his manorial title at auction in 1986 a self - styled peer dubbed the ' @entity4 ' who once planned the world 's biggest bank raid has been ordered to pay back £ 1.2m to the victims of his investment scam or face even longer in prison			1
' lord ' @entity0 , 67 , was jailed for seven years in 2012 for fleecing up to 600 pensioners out of £ 6million with the promise of ' rich rewards ' in return for them investing their life savings			1
the fraudster , who used his ill gotten gains to splash out on a chauffeur driven @entity20 and a £ 2million mansion in @entity22 , has now been ordered to repay £ 1.2million to his victims			1
if he fails to repay the money in six months he must serve another seven years in prison			1
@entity26 , deputy director of the @entity28 's @entity27 , said : ' @entity0 's criminality funded a lavish lifestyle , but our investigations do not end when a criminal is put in jail			1
' money is at the heart of all organised crime and is the motivation for most criminals , so we are determined to take their profits off them			2
' the clock is ticking for @entity0 to hand over the money he made from this enterprise			1
@entity0 , along with several accomplices , targeted the elderly and sold them worthless shares in a boiler room scam			1
the gang had drawn up a ' sucker list ' of targets , detailing people who had already invested in some shares			0
they then used high pressure sales techniques to trick these people into handing over money to invest in firms they claimed would be floated on the stock market			0
they claimed these firms handled ' exotic ' and ' fail - safe ' projects such as land development in @entity64 and @entity65			0
however none of the firms were ever floated and the investors lost thousands to the fraudsters			0
one 87 - year - old man lost more than £ 800,000			1
@entity0 , along with accomplices @entity71 , 45 , @entity73 , 34 , and @entity74 , 31 , were found guilty of running the scam between 2004 and 2007 after a trial at @entity77 in 2012			1
@entity78 , prosecuting , said the four men had been involved in the ' dishonest extraction of several million pounds ' from investors			0
self - styled lord @entity0 has been ordered to repay £ 1.2m in six months or face another seven years in prison after he was found guilty in 2012 of fleecing hundreds of pensioners out of their life savings in a scam victims were told they would quickly make ' handsome profits ' when the companies were floated on the @entity89			1
' this type of trick involving the dishonest selling of worthless shares is colloquially known as a boiler room fraud , ' said mr @entity78			1
' the term is used to describe high pressure sales techniques often targeting elderly and vulnerable victims			0
' a large number of victims in this case were subjected to high pressure sells and repeated calls until they agreed to invest			0
' one 87 - year - old gentleman unfortunately parted with £ 828,000 investing in most of the companies			1
' many of the elderly victims are not fools by any stretch of the imagination ; they are all successful , responsible individuals who eventually gave in to sales patter			0
' those who agreed to invest were almost always sent a contract setting out the amount of shares they agreed to , the price per share and a letter providing details of how their share made payment			0
' mr @entity78 said none of the victims received any return on their investment as most of the companies appeared to do little or no trading at all			0
at the heart of the scam was a ' floor book ' - a list of more than 1,000 investors , of whom 600 handed over cash to the fraudsters			2
the document was seized after being discovered on @entity0 's computer when his @entity137 property was searched following his arrest			2
mr @entity78 added : ' the floor book records around £ 6million worth of investment and marks as received a figure in the region of £ 3million			0
' but what the bank accounts show is what was actually received that can in fact be traced back to the floor book - around £ 2.7million			2
@entity74 ( left ) , @entity71 ( centre ) and @entity73 ( right ) were found guilty of running the boiler room scam along with @entity0 , which saw them steal £ 6m and defraud hundreds of pensioners out of their savings ' the defendants used so - called sucker lists , detailing people with small shareholdings , and started phoning people up offering shares in exotic land development buildings in @entity64 and @entity65 and water desalination projects			1
' the group defrauded their victims through companies including @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170 , and @entity171 , between january 1 , 2005 and june 30 , 2007			0
mr @entity78 said the invested money passed through the bank accounts either of the fraudsters , or accounts controlled by them			2
@entity176 , 44 , was cleared of involvement in the fraud but found guilty of laundering the proceeds along with the others			0
@entity0 , a father of three , was born @entity181 in @entity182 in 1947 and bought his manorial title at auction in 1986			1
during his trial he claimed he was not part of any plot to con investors and told jurors he did not act dishonestly			0

this failed and they returned the next day to attempt more transfers but these also failed because they had made an error in filling in the wire transfer information boxes			0
eventually a complex paper trail of accounts they were supposed to transfer to led to @entity0 , @entity206 , @entity225 and @entity226 - a @entity228 national who was cleared of all charges			2
@entity225 died before the trial			0
the men fronted companies used for illegal money laundering			0
