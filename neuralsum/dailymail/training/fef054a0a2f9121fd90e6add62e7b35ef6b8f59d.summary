@entity1 president @entity0 today vowed to expand @entity1 influence in the @entity3 - as he battles to contain the rising economic and military might of @entity5			1
he promised to ' project power and deter threats to peace ' in that part of the world , hours after he announced he would be permanently stationing military aircraft and up to 2,500 @entity12 in northern @entity13			1
news of the training hub ' to help allies and protect @entity1 interests across @entity3 ' comes despite a reduction in defence spending and the winding down of the wars in @entity21 and @entity22			1
promise : @entity1 president @entity0 today vowed to expand @entity1 influence in the @entity3 - as he battles to contain the rising economic and military might of @entity5 shaking : @entity0 greeted @entity13 troops during a visit to the @entity27 @entity26 in @entity28 he said in a speech to the @entity13 parliament : ' the @entity1 is a @entity3 power , and we are here to stay '			1
he declared the @entity1 was not afraid of @entity5 , by far the biggest and most powerful country in the region			1
@entity5 immediately questioned the @entity1 move and said it deserved further scrutiny			2
emphasising that a @entity1 presence in the @entity3 is a top priority of his administration , @entity0 stressed that any reductions in @entity1 defence spending will not come at the expense of that goal			2
he said : ' let there be no doubt : in the @entity3 in the 21st century , the @entity1 is all in			2
' promises : @entity1 president @entity0 ( left ) spoke to @entity1 @entity12 and @entity13 troops at the @entity48 in @entity28 , alongside @entity13 prime minister @entity49 vow : @entity1 president @entity0 said he will expand @entity1 influence in the @entity3 declaration : @entity0 said the @entity1 was not afraid of @entity5 , by far the biggest and most powerful country in the region from @entity54 , @entity0 flew to the northern city of @entity28 , where some of the @entity12 bound for @entity13 will be based			1
he visited a military base and spoke to @entity1 and @entity13 troops			1
with military bases and tens of thousands of troops in @entity60 and @entity61 , the @entity1 has maintained a significant military presence in @entity3 for decades			1
@entity13 lies about 5,500 miles south of @entity5 , and its northern shores would give the @entity1 easier access to the @entity65 , a vital commercial route			1
the plan outlined by @entity0 will allow the @entity1 to keep a sustained force on @entity13 bases and position equipment and supplies there			2
it will give the @entity1 ability to train with allies in the region and respond more quickly to humanitarian or other crises			0
@entity1 officials said the pact was not an attempt to create a permanent @entity1 military presence in @entity13			1
about 250 @entity1 @entity12 will begin a rotation in northern @entity13 starting next year , with a full force of 2,500 military personnel staffing up over the next several years			1
the @entity1 will bear the cost of the deployment and the troops will be shifted from other deployments around the world			0
@entity0 's visit marked the first time a sitting @entity1 president has been to @entity28 , where @entity1 and @entity13 forces were killed in a @entity60 attack during @entity94 the president then laid a wreath at a memorial for the @entity98 , a @entity100 destroyer that was sunk during that battle			1
for @entity0 , @entity3 represents both a security challenge and an economic opportunity			2
speaking in broad geopolitical terms , the president asserted : ' with most of the world 's nuclear powers and some half of humanity , @entity3 will largely define whether the century ahead will be marked by conflict or cooperation , needless suffering or human progress			2
' commentators said that virtually everything @entity0 is doing on his nine - day trip across the @entity3 has a @entity5 subtext , underscoring a relationship that is at once cooperative and marked by tensions over currency , human rights and military might			1
@entity5 's military spending has increased threefold since the 1990s to about $ 160 billion last year , and its military recently tested a new stealth jet fighter and launched its first aircraft carrier			0
a congressional advisory panel yesterday urged the @entity127 and @entity128 to look more closely at @entity5 's military expansion			0
and it pressed for a tougher stance against what it called anti-competitive @entity5 trade policies			0
the expanded basing agreement with @entity13 is just one of several initiatives @entity0 has taken that is likely to set @entity138 on edge at a tricky time			0
the @entity1 is @entity5 's second largest trading partner , and the economies are deeply intertwined			2
respects : @entity0 and @entity49 laid wreaths at the @entity144 today addressing : @entity1 president @entity0 made his comments on security in the region to the @entity148 in @entity54 earlier today @entity5 leaders do not want the economy disrupted when global growth is shaky and they are preparing to transfer power to a new leadership next year			1
@entity28 , where the @entity12 will be based , was yesterday dubbed the ' @entity155 of @entity13 ' by its prime minister @entity49			2
more bombs were dropped on @entity28 during a surprise @entity60 raid during @entity94 than on @entity155 , in @entity159 , where 2,395 were killed			0
the @entity155 nickname will sit uncomfortably with many @entity13 , who fear the stationing of @entity1 troops could make them a target for terrorists			2
over the weekend , while playing host to @entity5 president @entity166 and other @entity168 leaders at a summit in @entity159 , @entity0 said the @entity1 would join a new regional free trade group that so far has excluded @entity5			1
that added an economic dimension to what some @entity5 commentators have called a new @entity1 containment policy that features reinvigorated defense ties with nations along @entity5 's perimeter , from traditional allies @entity60 and the @entity180 to former enemy @entity181 , all of whom are anxious about growing @entity5 power			1
@entity5 was immediately leery of the prospect of an expanded @entity1 military presence in @entity13			1
@entity189 spokesman @entity188 said there should be discussion as to whether the plan was in line with the common interests of the international community			0
tribute : one of @entity0 's first engagements of today was to visit the @entity198 in @entity54 respects : @entity0 laid a wreath at the @entity198 ( left ) before signing its @entity201 historic : @entity0 ( centre ) walked along the @entity205 with @entity13 pm @entity49 ( right ) and chairman of the @entity198 @entity207 ( left ) responding to questions at a news conference yesterday with @entity13 prime minister @entity49 , @entity0 sought to downplay tension between the world powers			0
he said : ' the notion that we fear @entity5 is mistaken			0
' capital city of @entity215 population of 127,500 least populous of all @entity13 's capital cities proximity to @entity3 makes it important gateway enjoys a tropical climate , with a wet and a dry season had to be rebuilt after @entity60 air raids during @entity94 city was also devastated by @entity225 in 1974 @entity0 avoided a confrontational tone with @entity5 in his speech to the @entity13 parliament , praising @entity138 as a partner in reducing tensions on the @entity231 and preventing proliferation			1
he said : ' we 'll seek more opportunities for cooperation with @entity138 , including greater communication between our militaries to promote understanding and avoid miscalculation			0
' in a note of caution , however , he added : ' we will do this , even as continue to speak candidly with @entity138 about the importance of upholding international norms and respecting the universal human rights of the @entity5 people			0
' having ruled out military reductions in @entity3 and the @entity3 , the @entity0 administration has three main areas where it could cut troop strength : @entity251 , the @entity252 and the @entity1 all @entity1 troops are being withdrawn from @entity21 by the end of this year , and a draw down in @entity22 is under way			1
but the @entity257 has said recently that the @entity1 will maintain a major presence in the greater @entity252 as a hedge against @entity261 aggression and influence			0
new home : @entity28 is the capital city of the @entity215 with a population of 127,500 a more likely area for troop reductions is @entity251 , although no decisions have been announced			0
the debate over defence budgets is just one aspect of a broader political fight over fixing the nation 's debt problem during a presidential election season			0
already , the @entity257 is facing $ 450 billion in cuts over ten years , as part of a budget deal approved last summer			0
and if a special congressional committee ca n't agree on $ 1.2 trillion in more long - term cuts or @entity128 rejects its plan , then cuts of $ 1.2 trillion kick in , with half coming from defence			0
arrival : @entity1 president @entity0 is now in the @entity287 island of @entity288 for the @entity289 @entity13 's prime minister @entity49 said : ' we are a region that is growing economically			1
but stability is important for economic growth , too			0
' she said that ' our alliance has been a bedrock of stability in our region '			0
@entity0 's visit is intended to show the tightness of that relationship and he hailed the long ties between the @entity1 and @entity13 , two nations far away that have spilled blood together he said : ' from the trenches of the @entity307 to the mountains of @entity22 - @entity13 and @entity1 have stood together , fought together and given their lives together in every single major conflict of the past hundred years			2
' located : the @entity1 has military bases around the world , as depicted in this graphic			0
