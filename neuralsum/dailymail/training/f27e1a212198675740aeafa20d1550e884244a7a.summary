by @entity0 and @entity1 and @entity2 horrific pictures today revealed the scale of the ongoing slaughter in @entity6 after government troops regained control of a strategic border town from rebel fighters			1
the graphic images purported to show the corpses of rebels killed during the three - week battle over the town of @entity16 , which was captured by @entity18 's forces today			1
the news comes as a @entity21 official insisted there is a ' growing body of persuasive evidence ' that the regime has been using chemical weapons against its rebel opponents			1
it is believed that @entity18 's government has acquired such weapons , including the deadly nerve gas sarin , from foreign allies such as @entity33 and @entity34			1
warning : @entity35 horror : this image purports to show rebel fighters killed by the @entity6 army during the battle for control of @entity16 state television reported this morning that @entity18 's troops , backed by the @entity44 militia @entity43 , had seized control of @entity16 from the rebels who had held it for more than two years			1
the government claimed to have ' restored security and peace ' and defeated ' terrorist networks ' in the town			2
the loss of @entity16 is likely to come as a major blow to the rebels , as the town was crucial to its ability to smuggle supplies into @entity6 from @entity57			1
images broadcast by state - run tv channels appeared to show the bodies of rebels lying around the city , and reporters claimed that the fighting had stopped after the government 's declaration of victory			1
@entity68 : the images from @entity6 state television depict the aftermath of the three - week stand - off @entity73 : another image claiming to show the body of a rebel fighter killed by government troops yesterday officials from both @entity79 and the @entity21 said that tests had proven the use of chemical weapons as part of the country 's civil war			1
foreign minister @entity86 said the presence of sarin was detected by researchers in @entity90 , adding that it had been used ' several times ' , including at least once by the regime			2
@entity79 , which is pushing to arm rebels fighting @entity18 's army , said the use of the gas was in breach of all international protocols			1
the @entity99 said that its own tests had independently confirmed the use of sarin and other chemical agents			2
a spokesman for @entity105 today called on an independent @entity107 investigation to establish the ' full facts ' about the use of chemical weapons in the conflict , and urged @entity18 to co-operate with the inspectors appointed by @entity107 secretary general @entity113			1
' there is a growing body of persuasive evidence that the regime has used and continues to use chemical weapons , but there is a need , through the @entity107 , to establish the full facts , ' he said			0
' the room for doubt continues to diminish , but we remain very much of the view that what we need is for this independent @entity107 investigation to get to the full facts			0
' the prime minister 's spokesman refused to confirm that the findings were a ' game - changer ' , but he added : ' we have been very clear that president @entity18 has no future			1
' battle : a @entity6 soldier patrols the streets of @entity16 , which was crucial for rebel access to @entity57 civil war : the battle for @entity16 comes after @entity141 officials revealed chemical weapons had been used @entity6 began building its chemical weapons programme after a series of military defeats by @entity146 , its fierce regional rival which has a stockpile of nuclear arms			1
because the @entity152 regime did not have the technological capability to make its own nerve agents , it turned to allies abroad for help			0
@entity34 , @entity33 and @entity157 are believed to be among the countries which provided assistance with @entity6 's chemical weapons facilities			1
the government also imported chemicals which can be used for both civilian and military purposes from @entity165 manufacturers			0
to reduce its dependence on foreign suppliers , @entity152 set up an agency for military research which is said to be far more advanced than any other scientific facility in the country			0
photographs have already been produced of victims including young children dying from the chemicals			0
@entity176 is odourless , and so hard to detect , often leaving people with no idea that they were have been exposed to the gas			0
worrying : the aftermath of an air strike in @entity16 after the announcement about chemical weapons within a few minutes , victims experience runny nose , tightness in the chest , and pupil constriction			2
then they have difficulty breathing , get sick , and start to drool before they lose control of all their bodily functions , begin twitching and ultimately suffocate in a series of convulsive spasms			0
' it is a horrendous death , and one that the international community can not allow , ' said a foreign ministry source in the @entity79 capital			2
both @entity18 and the @entity6 rebels have accused each other of using chemical weapons , but this is the first solid evidence of ' localised use ' , said mr @entity86			1
@entity208 has previously warned that if @entity18 's forces are found to have deployed chemical weapons , they will cross a ' red line ' and trigger a more robust response from the @entity215 government , which has so far been reluctant to become too involved in the civil war			1
march was the bloodiest month of the conflict so far , with more than 6,000 people killed , including more than 500 women and children			0
some 70,000 people are thought to have died since the uprising began in march 2011 as part of the @entity225 revolution across the @entity226 and @entity227			0
hundreds of thousands more have been wounded , imprisoned and made homeless			0
allegations : this image shows forces loyal to @entity18 during an operation ; they are accused of using sarin @entity176 was first developed in @entity233 in 1938 by two scientists who were trying to create a stronger pesticide			2
when its potential for chemical warfare was realised during the @entity240 , the @entity236 started mass - producing it , but it was never used			0
@entity242 listed sarin as a standard chemical weapon in the 1950s , but it was not used properly until 1988 when @entity247 dictator @entity246 used it to wipe out some 5000 people in the @entity251 city of @entity252 , in northern @entity247			0
they all died over the course of two days when some 20 aircraft dropped the chemicals on the town			0
sarin gas was also said to have been used during the @entity259 in 2004 , with the west using it as evidence of the banned weapons of mass destruction the @entity215 and @entity21 governments claimed @entity247 possessed			2
mr @entity86 said : ' these tests show the presence of sarin in various samples in our possession			0
@entity79 is certain that sarin gas was used several times in @entity6 in limited areas			1
' mr @entity86 said that the test results had been handed to the @entity107 because chemical weapons are banned by international law			0
it came as a @entity107 report stated that there were ' reasonable grounds ' to suggest that chemical weapons were being used in @entity6			2
mr @entity86 would not state whether the @entity176 had been used by the @entity283 , or by the rebels .			0
