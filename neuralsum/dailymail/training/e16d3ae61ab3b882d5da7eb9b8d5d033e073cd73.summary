the passenger , who had been attempting to board the train , was then dragged along the platform			2
the @entity44 report said : ' the passenger suffered injuries to her neck and back , but the actions of the member of staff may have saved her from being more badly hurt			1
' the accident report said the driver had been unable to see what was happening on the platform after the train had begun to move			1
it added that the role of the station assistant who came to the passenger 's aid involved the safe despatch of trains - but that the equipment and procedures associated with the role do not enable such assistants to intervene effectively in an emergency			0
the accident report said the driver had been unable to see what was happening on the platform after the train had begun to move the incident occurred at about 7pm on february 3 this year			1
@entity80 , operations director for the @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity20 lines , said : ' the safety of customers and staff is our top priority and we do all we can to ensure customers can travel safely at all times			0
' the quick thinking of our staff during this incident prevented further injury to the customer , and all of our safety procedures and warnings were carried out as normal before the train moved away from the platform			0
' thankfully , incidents of this nature are extremely rare on our network and the @entity28 is one of the safest railways in the world following heavy investment in safety improvements , and we are constantly seeking to further improve our excellent safety record			0
' we have fully assisted the @entity44 in their investigation , as well as carrying out our own , and we will fully consider their recommendation			0
' the @entity44 said that the last fatal accident of this type on the @entity115 system , on october 21 , 1997 , had occurred at the same location in similar circumstances and involved the same type of train			1
in the 1997 incident , a nine - year - old boy caught his anorak in a closing tube train door and was dragged along the platform and under the train			1
however , the report into this year 's incident said : ' there do not appear to be any factors associated with the location that could create any link between the 1997 and 2014 accidents			2
' on the 2014 incident , the @entity44 made a recommendation to @entity115 ' covering possible improvements to the means available to staff to stop trains from departing if an emergency occurs during the train despatch process '			2
@entity139 , general secretary of the @entity141 union , said : ' the fact that the @entity44 have praised the member of staff is just another in a long line of concrete examples that reinforce our case for the retention and expansion of staffing levels on the platforms and stations across @entity115			2
' another @entity44 report just published said that during the start of the evening rush - hour , concrete cladding fell from a bridge spanning @entity159 in south @entity22 , with most of the debris landing on the station 's platform 1			0
the fallen concrete was reported by two train drivers and train services were stopped on the line closest to the debris			0
no one was struck and there was no damage to trains in the incident on august 1 , 2013 , but train services were disrupted for the rest of the day while emergency repairs were carried out			0
the report said the concrete cladding was added to the bridge structure in about 1910 and fell because of gradual deterioration of the fixing arrangements			0
it said : ' deterioration of the cladding fixing arrangements had been reported to @entity184 ( @entity185 ) over a period of at least four years but the resulting actions taken by @entity185 and its works contractor were inadequate			0
