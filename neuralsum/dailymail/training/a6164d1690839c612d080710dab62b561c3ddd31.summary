' it went on to say : ' in the @entity38 , @entity9 also wanted the title @entity40 and in the next two they used their own means again against the states of @entity35 , two world wars and millions of dead , obviously this was not enough to quieten @entity9 egomania			1
' once again it has surfaced but this time not with the use of cannon , this time it 's the @entity25			0
' the @entity9 believe it 's theirs and we have to submit , surrender , hand ourselves over to the new @entity54 who wants to rule in our own house			0
' it is not the first time that @entity11 has been at the centre of controversy with @entity9 - two months ago after @entity2 beat @entity9 in the @entity61 semi final they printed a picture of @entity8 below the headline : ' @entity66 , ciao culona ' which translates as ' @entity67			2
' last year it was alleged that @entity3 , who stepped down as prime minister last november , had been taped calling the @entity9 leader ' culona ' although he has insisted they had a good working relationship and are still in touch - claims which have been denied in @entity74			0
the picture in newspaper @entity11 - owned by former prime minister @entity3 , left , also showed chancellor @entity8 , right , raising her right arm in salute , a gesture associated with @entity19 's followers @entity9 has been at loggerheads with @entity2 over the handling of the ongoing @entity84 crisis and accusing @entity85 of not doing enough to get its finances in order to resolve the single currency problem which has been dragging on for two years			1
newspapers in @entity9 have repeatedly attacked the southern @entity35 economies of @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity2 for their poor performances and bail outs offered to them			2
@entity11 has repeatedly accused current @entity2 technocrat prime minister @entity96 , of not doing enough to stand up to @entity9 , comparing him to @entity98 who famously declared in 1938 he had ' secured peace in our time ' after holding talks with @entity17 dictator @entity19 only for war to break out the following year			1
criticism : @entity11 has repeatedly accused current @entity2 technocrat prime minister @entity96 , pictured , of not doing enough to stand up to @entity9 in an interview with @entity9 weekly news magazine @entity108 , @entity96 called on @entity8 to show greater flexibility on how the @entity110 tackles the eurozone crisis and suggested there could be a backlash if this does not occur			1
chancellor @entity8 has repeatedly argued that the only way to restore confidence in the under - fire single currency in the long term is for eurozone countries to show budget discipline and concede sovereignty to achieve greater fiscal integration			2

' but within hours of the interview @entity8 and @entity9 mps hit back at @entity96			0
@entity146 , a spokesman for the @entity9 leader , said : ' the chancellor 's opinion is that we in @entity9 have always done well with the right balance between parliamentary support and the participation of parliament			0

we need to strengthen , not weaken , democratic legitimization in @entity35			0
' @entity96 is due to meet chancellor @entity8 later this month in @entity74 to again discuss the @entity84 crisis and today markets were positive as the spread between @entity9 and @entity2 bonds dropped .			2
