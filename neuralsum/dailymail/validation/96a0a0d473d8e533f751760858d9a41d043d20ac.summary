after the @entity0 on saturday afternoon in @entity1 — where their title hopes will be crushed or resurrected — @entity3 will set about further diminishing the value of the old @entity5 at @entity6			1
@entity8 ’s team can not lose			1
the notion of defeat is unthinkable , in an increasingly downgraded fixture			2
last year , the @entity13 raiders left @entity14 with a 20 - 0 victory and the scoreline fairly reflected the poverty of the @entity19 display			2
if anything , it flattered them			0
@entity3 go through the motions in training as @entity24 offloads the ball at @entity6 @entity26 passes the ball as @entity3 ran through their moves for the final time before the @entity30 clash @entity3 will be wounded after their defeat to @entity32 , and are sure to bounce back by beating @entity30 @entity33 lifts the @entity5 aloft after winning it at @entity14 last year @entity8 's men need a win against @entity30 , and should get it against the wooden spoon candidates since then , @entity37 has brought @entity39 steel and some encouraging results , but saturday 's visitors are bottom of the @entity44 table after three straight defeats — the last at home to @entity47 — and they have not won in south west @entity48 for two generations			1
@entity50 was prime minister the last time @entity30 left @entity6 as conquerors , in 1983			2
since then , they have endured 32 years of failure at the home of their ‘ @entity55 ’ and this does not appear to be the occasion when that dire run is destined to come to an end			0
@entity61 summed up @entity3 ’s mood on friday , saying : ‘ i ’ll be disappointed if we do n’t get the performance this week — and with that hopefully we could be able to keep the record going			2
’ so , at the end of a week which began with @entity71 bemoaning a lack of @entity55 ‘ respect ’ for @entity19 rugby , the @entity68 full - back and his team - mates have a prime opportunity to regain it , by claiming a win which would amount to one of the upsets of the era			1
they will be desperate to salvage a crumbling campaign but @entity3 are also in wounded mode after their beating in @entity85 , which derailed the @entity87 bandwagon for the umpteenth year			1
given the vast gulf in playing resources between the two nations , @entity3 would have the clout to prevail with three or four entirely different line - ups			2
@entity93 goes for a run with the ball as @entity3 prepared for the must - win fixture at @entity6 @entity97 works on his kicking as @entity99 watches on during the final training session @entity101 throws as pass as @entity3 's forwards look on , ahead of a game they should win easily @entity3 could beat @entity30 with three of four different @entity105 , and will have more than enough on saturday @entity30 go through their paces at @entity6 on friday - it 's an important game for them to restore pride that is not to denigrate the @entity19 ; it is just a reflection of stark reality			1
@entity37 ’s side have dropped to 10th in the @entity118 rankings , six places behind @entity3 who have shifted clear of fifth - placed @entity115			1
another defeat for @entity30 would leave them in danger of being over-taken by @entity121 , while losing further ground on @entity123 above them			1
so if @entity125 and his squad have any pretensions of mounting a meaningful @entity130 challenge , this is a fixture with no safety net			0
they can not lose , because to do so would shatter all hope of going into the tournament with their stadium regarded as a place where visiting teams fear to tread			0
defeat would wreck the quest to create that fortress - feel at @entity6 and would also ensure that @entity3 could not rely on telling momentum to propel them into the showpiece event in september and october			1
it is quite feasible these nations will meet again in a @entity130 quarter - final at the same venue on october 18			0
the thought of losing that one would be enough to give @entity125 sleepless nights for the next seven months			0
the last time @entity30 beat @entity3 at @entity6 in 1983 , @entity50 was still prime minister @entity148 celebrates a @entity30 try , but the @entity5 has been devalued by @entity3 's dominance since fortunately for the head coach , he has a squad who are driven by a fervent desire to make amends for their loss to @entity32 , and more than enough trump cards to ensure this is an occasion devoid of tension and a nasty shock at the end			1
what is crucially absent from the @entity55 armoury is an ability to shape their own championship destiny			0
in the hours before kick - off , they must decide whether to stay true to their pre-match plan involving a black - out of all news from @entity1 , where @entity172 can do them an almighty favour by ending @entity32 ’s @entity87 crusade at the penultimate stage			2
instead of being distracted by a game elsewhere which will all but confirm whether they remain in the title hunt , @entity3 will abide by one of their favourite mantras : ‘ control the controllables ’			0
the coaches will expect the returning @entity24 to galvanise the home pack and shore up the line - out operation , while @entity186 ’s recall after injury will add nous to the back line			0
there will be blunt demands for a better start , better discipline , more assurance under the high ball and more collective conviction at the breakdown — with a particular onus on captain @entity33 in that department			0
@entity8 's side could face @entity30 in the @entity130 quarter - finals , which may worry them more @entity30 present more of a creative threat than in the recent past , despite the cruel injury to one of their stellar centres , @entity205			1
@entity208 is a fine replacement , while @entity71 can run amok from deep and @entity210 is a daring orchestrator at @entity212 , alongside the canny @entity213			0
but none of them can function without the ball			0
despite the imposing size and abrasive streak of the @entity19 pack , they should be out - gunned up front			0
if the hosts ’ set - piece holds sway , which is likely , and @entity225 can get his side on the front foot , @entity97 has the tools to unleash an array of predatory outside runners			0
@entity3 must win and they will win			1
the @entity5 is no longer the cherished prize that it once was , so retaining it is a minimum requirement .			1

@entity3 's fate is not in their own hands , but they have to beat @entity30
defeat is unthinkable for @entity8 's side against weak @entity19
@entity3 are a wounded animal after @entity32 defeat
a win for @entity30 would be one of the upsets of the era
@entity5 is no longer the prize it once was , retaining it is a minimum
