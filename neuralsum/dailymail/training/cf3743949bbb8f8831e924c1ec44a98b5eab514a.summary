by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 10:08 est , 12 february 2013 updated : 12:45 est , 12 february 2013 an @entity4 man committed suicide in a high - security @entity8 jail in 2010 after being held for months in great secrecy , @entity4 's @entity3 channel said on tuesday , throwing new light on a case that has rattled @entity8			1
the unsourced @entity3 story named the man , known previously only as ' prisoner x ' , as @entity16			1
it added that it " understood " the 34 - year - old from @entity19 had been previously recruited by the @entity8 spy agency @entity20			1
there was no official comment on the story in @entity8			2
@entity3 claims ' @entity24 ' , who is thought to have taken his own life in @entity27 in 2010 , was @entity4 citizen @entity16 @entity16 was secretly imprisoned in @entity8 's @entity27 in @entity29 in the wing built to accommodate @entity31 , the assassin of the @entity8 president @entity32 , @entity3 reported however , within hours of the report surfacing , prime minister @entity36 's office summoned @entity8 editors to ask them not to publish a story ' that is very embarrassing to a certain government agency ' , @entity8 's @entity34 newspaper said			1
' the emergency meeting was called following a broadcast outside @entity8 regarding the incident in question , " @entity34 said , giving no further information			2
shortly afterwards , all reference to the @entity4 report vanished from @entity8 news sites - including @entity34 itself			1
@entity53 party leader @entity52 , responding to the move , said : ' the phenomenon of journalists volunteering to censor information at the request of the authorities is patently undemocratic			0
' i had hoped that this would have ended decades ago			0
in a democracy , censorship is justified only out of security considerations , subject to the @entity64 , which ensures that it is justified and that there truly is immediate certainty of harming [ national ] security			0
' prime minister @entity36 's office asked @entity8 editor 's not to publish a story ' that is very embarrassing to a certain government agency ' such a gag order is highly unusual in @entity8 , where state military censors normally allow local media to quote foreign sources on controversial incidents - such as an alleged attack on @entity79 last month by the @entity8 airforce			1
@entity16 , who used the name @entity16 or @entity82 after moving to @entity8 , was secretly imprisoned in @entity27 in @entity29 in the wing built to accommodate @entity31 , the assassin of the @entity8 president @entity32 , @entity3 reported			1
the 34 - year - old was reported to be the son of @entity87 , the executive director of the @entity88 and one of the leaders of the @entity91			0
@entity16 was married to an @entity8 woman and had two young children			2
he gave his occupation as lawyer but secretly worked as a @entity20 agent			0
he had reportedly spent a number of months in the @entity24 cell before he was found hanged			0
exactly what he did to end up in prison remains unclear			0
@entity3 reported that the man attended @entity104 schools in @entity19 's south east before studying law			1
his parents refused to be involved in the investigation			0
@entity3 said that @entity87 's imprisonment was so secret that not even his guards knew his name			2
however , word got out at the time of a mysterious prisoner and human rights groups wrote to the state to demand more information			0
' it is insupportable that , in a democratic country , authorities can arrest people in complete secrecy and disappear them from public view without the public even knowing such an arrest took place , ' the @entity118 wrote in june 2010			0
when @entity8 's @entity130 website announced @entity24 had been found dead inside a cell that was regularly watched and supposedly suicide - proof , the story was quickly removed because of a gag order			1
@entity3 said @entity87 had moved to @entity8 10 years before his death and changed his name to @entity16			1
it gave no reason for his imprisonment , speculating only that it would have had to concern espionage and sensitive state secrets			0
funeral notices from @entity4 show that @entity87 's body was flown back to @entity19 at the end of december 2010 for burial .			2

@entity144 locked up in @entity8 ' jail within a jail ' thought to have been @entity4
unsourced @entity3 story named the man as @entity16 , 34 , from @entity19
@entity8 has never acknowledged prisoner 's existence
it has tried to impose a reporting black - out on the story
