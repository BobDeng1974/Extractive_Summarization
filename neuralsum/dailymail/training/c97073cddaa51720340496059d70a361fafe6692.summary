he won fame in the @entity123 after helping to convince @entity19 to pick their first black president in 2008 and then helped @entity8 's re-election four years later			2
but the two presidential triumphs are only the highest profile in a string of @entity130 successes that have made the 59 - year - old @entity132 a back room political superstar			0
it began 30 years ago when , fresh from quitting his job as the youngest political editor in the history of the @entity137 , he helped oust a three - term @entity139 senator for @entity140			0
