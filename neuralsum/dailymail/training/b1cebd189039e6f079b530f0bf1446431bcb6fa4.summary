by @entity0 traditional county names like @entity2 and @entity3 could become a familiar sight again on @entity6 ’s roads after ministers yesterday lifted a ban on displaying them on street signs			1
in a move to mark @entity13 , the communities secretary @entity11 said planning laws were being changed to allow councils to display traditional county names alongside more modern creations			1
ministers are also consulting on a further change that would allow councils to erect stand - alone road signs telling motorists they have crossed an ancient boundary of counties like @entity24 and @entity25			1
signs such as this one , formerly of @entity2 , could have their old counties on them to celebrate heritage mr @entity11 said the change in the rules would make it easier for @entity6 to celebrate its own rich heritage			1
he said : ‘ the tapestry of @entity6 ’s counties binds our nation together , and is interwoven with our cultural fabric - from our cricket to our ales			1
previous governments have tried to wipe the counties off the map , imposing bland administrative structures or alien euro - regions			2
‘ but i believe we are stronger as a nation when we cherish and champion our local and traditional ties			0
' this government is proud to wave the flag of @entity50 alongside both our county flags			0
' whatever one ’s class , colour or creed , we should have pride in our @entity6 identities within the @entity58 that binds us together			1
’ the boundaries of @entity6 ’s 39 traditional counties have remain largely unchanged since the @entity61			1
but successive waves of local government reorganisation , most notably @entity65 ’s 1972 shaek - up , have threatened to blur their boundaries and wipe some off the map altogether			2
under existing laws the use of anything other than modern local authority names is classed as an advertisement			0
stand - alone road signs may also be erected to highlight ancient boundaries such as @entity24 @entity75 can not declare its @entity77 heritage on signs because it is now a unitary authority			1
similar rules prevent @entity82 saying it is in @entity84 or @entity85 declaring it is in @entity87			0
tv astrologer @entity88 , founder of the @entity89 , welcomed the announcement			0
the former @entity91 said : ‘ this is great news for counties like my own , @entity2			0
we lost our county council in 1965 , but our county continues to exist			0
' some @entity99 boroughs like @entity100 have actively supported @entity2 signs on their boundaries , and @entity103 are keen to proclaim the town as the historic county town of @entity2			2
flashback : @entity11 announced the plan to put old counties ' names on street signs to mark @entity13 ' these common sense changes will give local councils and communities the confidence to promote historic local heritage and identity			1
’ ministers believe reviving the use of @entity121 ’s traditional county names could foster a sense of national pride and boost tourism			0
a source said : ‘ they provide an instant means of reference to different parts of the country , to a set of cities , towns and villages , to distinctive scenery , architecture and wildlife , to particular industries and pastimes , accents and dialect , tourist attractions and so on			0
‘ a large literature focuses on each of the counties - they give their names to clubs and societies , to teams people play for , to regiments they serve in			2
' and they often provide a family link with past generations			0
’ under the new planning guidance on advertising , councils will be deemed to have the power to use traditional county names on signs provided they do not create dangerous roadside clutter			2
the guidance states : ‘ local authorities may install signs indicating the boundary of a historic or traditional county on their land			2
depending on circumstances , such signs may benefit from deemed consent			0
‘ authorities need to bear in mind how such sign - posting can benefit the local economy and reflect this through the decision - taking process , where such signs are appropriate and locally - supported			1
’ however , the move comes just days after transport secretary @entity176 warned councils to cut down on the excessive number of signs cluttering @entity121 ’s roads			1
regulations are set to be tightened up after research by the @entity183 found the total number of road signs has more than doubled in the last 20 years to 4.5 million .			0
