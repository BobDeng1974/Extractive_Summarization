@entity14 ( pictured ) has been struck off for kissing a female patient in his surgery in @entity16 , @entity17 but the woman , who is in her 60s , said she was disturbed and distressed by the kiss , which left her feeling ' dirty '			1
the @entity22 ruled his behaviour was in breach of professional standards and was sexually motivated and removed him from the register			1
@entity3 has denied it was driven by desire			2
he said : ' this was a woman in her 60s who had come in for a session with her husband sitting in the waiting room			1
' i had been given a tale of woe , and it was just as a parent would say to a child , ' let me kiss that better			0
' she was not a new patient and had been coming to see me for more than 18 months			2
' i did it out of a sense of sympathy , empathy , care and concern			1
' she did not seem at all distressed , and the first i knew about it was her husband coming to see me a few days later			2
' a panel heard that the kiss happened at the @entity53 ( pictured ) in august last year the panel heard that the kiss happened at the @entity53 in august last year			2
a potential interim suspension hearing at the time found that @entity3 was not an immediate danger and allowed him to continue practising			1
but now he has been struck off after a full hearing			0
a spokesman for the @entity22 said : ' mr @entity3 admitted that he kissed a female patient during treatment without her consent			1
' the kiss was between the base of the neck and the point of the shoulder			0
' the @entity69 concluded that such a kiss does not conform to any social convention , was inherently sexual and also sexually motivated			0
' it also noted that the patient found the kiss to be disturbing and distressing , and felt " dirty " as a result of what had happened			0
@entity3 ( pictured ) said the woman had given him ' a tale of woe ' and he kissed her like a parent would a child ' to make it better ' ' it found that mr @entity3 's behaviour was a particularly serious departure from acceptable standards , and that he displayed a reckless disregard of his professional obligations to maintain clear sexual boundaries with patients and treat them with respect			1
' the committee did not accept that he was now unlikely to behave in a similar way again			0
' @entity3 said he had been planning to retire next year and would not appeal the decision			1
he claimed : ' by the time of the hearing i had got together a huge bundle of letters of support from my patients			0
' they have been 100 per cent supportive of me throughout the process without exception , as have my colleagues			0
' i will always argue the allegation it was sexually motivated is an absurd suggestion			0
' everybody in the profession thought i would be given an admonishment , which would be a considerable tarnish on the record but allow me to keep practising			0
' the clinic will continue to operate .			0
