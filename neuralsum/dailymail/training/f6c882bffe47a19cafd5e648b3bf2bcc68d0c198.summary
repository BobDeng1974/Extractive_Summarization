not so long ago panettones were expensive and exotic			1
but in recent years supermarket aisles have become awash with these @entity4 @entity3 cakes			1
however , how do you pick the best ? @entity4 chef @entity6 put a selection of supermarket panettones to the test			1
no wonder — it 's made just outside @entity22			1
and it tastes as good as it looks			1
it 's been filled properly , with a good proportion of fruit and peel ( 14 per cent sultanas and 7 per cent orange peel )			1
the peel is deliciously chunky — as it should be			1
and the dough is sweet and buttery			2
with panettone this cheap and delicious , even i 'd be mad to make my own			2
5/5 expensive : @entity36 's @entity35 , £ 10 @entity35 750g , £ 10 , @entity36 's as i unwrap it , i 'm enveloped in the smell of an @entity4 @entity3 : buttery dough and juicy sultanas			1
growing up in @entity43 , my breakfast treat on christmas day was home - made panettone and a huge latte			1
the crown is bouncy to the touch — so freshly baked — but the taste is disappointing			2
the peel content is just 3 per cent			2
for £ 10 , i expect something more luxurious			2
3/5 yuck ! @entity52 @entity52 500g , £ 4 , @entity52 though there 's a reasonable amount of fruit ( 16.5 per cent sultanas and 4 per cent peel ) it 's shrivelled , not juicy			1
its dough should be extremely soft , sweet and buttery ; this is as dry and crumbly as the bedding in my kids ' hamster cage , with a synthetic aftertaste			2
yuck ! 1/5 another winner : @entity67 christmas @entity52 750g , £ 9 ( £ 7 while stocks last ) , @entity67 the label says it 's rich in butter and flecked with raisins and candied orange peel			1
with a whopping 24 per cent raisins , i agree ( i normally use 20 per cent )			2
this would be good enough as the centrepiece of my @entity78 feast			2
5/5 taste the @entity79 and @entity80 750g , £ 10 , @entity36 's oh dear — this is horrid			0
when baked properly , a panettone is golden - brown on top and buttercup yellow inside			1
this is pale and insipid - looking and it sticks to the paper , so i suspect it has n't been baked properly			0
no wonder — it 's packed with 12 per cent orange peel			0
2/5 not traditional enough : @entity92 @entity92 800g , £ 3.99 , @entity92 rather than sultanas and orange peel this has chocolate instead			0
the chocolate is surprisingly good quality for the price — not too sweet			0
but the dough is crumbly and dry			0
my kids would love it			0
but i 'd rather they had a proper panettone with my own chocolate sauce than this			0
3/5 specially selected traditional @entity4 @entity35 500g , £ 2.99 , @entity107 there 's not enough sugar and the fruit ( 14 per cent sultanas and 9 per cent orange and lemon peel ) is on the dry side			1
the only way to save this is to butter a slice , sprinkle a little bit of sugar on top and then grill until lightly toasted			1
i 'd rather pay a little extra for a truly delicious panettone			0
1/5 @entity4 @entity17 1kg , £ 15 , @entity122 wow ! i love the white sugar sprinkles over the top			1
it looks like a giant @entity127 biscuit			0
as soon as i cut into this , i 'm engulfed by christmassy smells			0
my treat every november was to help my mum make panettones — six at a time			1
i 'd mix the dough while @entity135 soaked the fruit in dessert wine			0
once baked , she would wrap them in tea towels and hang them upside down on her washing line for four hours			0
that 's the secret to keeping the dough airy			0
@entity122 's is a little light on fruit ( 12 per cent sultanas ) but the dough is as moist as @entity135 's			0
magnificent ! 4/5 interview : @entity149 to watch @entity151 's ' full recipe click here .			0
