by @entity0 published : 07:04 est , 22 july 2013 updated : 01:31 est , 23 july 2013 a @entity2 comedy show chain called @entity3 is taking on @entity4 claiming the @entity6 company violated its copyright when naming the hit tv show , @entity9			1
@entity10 , which has four clubs under its 1999 trademark , ' @entity3 ' , is locked in a legal battle with @entity4 , the hugely popular musical show unlawfully ' swamped ' its own trademark			1
the club chain 's boss , @entity16 , has also accused the massive @entity19 - based outfit of ' threatening to take away his home ' if he loses the enormously costly legal action			0
success : glee is the top - rated television series on satellite tv , attracting millions of viewers , who were branded ' @entity28 ' days after one of tv show 's stars , @entity32 , died from a drug overdose , @entity4 has denied any trade mark infringement and called for @entity10 ' mark to be revoked at @entity37 's @entity36			1
@entity10 registered ' @entity3 ' trademark , including an image with the words in a spotlight , on june 19 , 1999 , the company 's barrister , @entity38 said			1
it opened venues under that name in @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 between 1994 and 2010 , hosting top comedians such as @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 , selling 1.5 million tickets			0
but comic @entity10 is , by any measure , a relative minnow compared to @entity4 - one of entertainment 's biggest fish			1
@entity10 registered ' @entity3 ' trademark , including an image with the words in a spotlight , on june 19 , 1999 , the company 's barrister , @entity38 said mr @entity16 , @entity10 ' owner , says he was stunned when , flicking through tv channels in 2010 , he discovered @entity9 , a show about an @entity65 , on @entity66			1
' i thought ' @entity69 - there 's a tv show with our name on it '			0
i warranted it to be serious enough to look into it and get to the bottom of what the hell was going on , ' he told judge @entity79			0
mr @entity16 , who thought the show had a ' saccharine , bland narrative ' , started to become especially worried when he realised the second season was a runaway success when it aired on @entity84 , later that year			0
that season , by @entity4 's own account , @entity9 was the top - rated television series on satellite tv , attracting millions of viewers , who were branded ' @entity28 '			1
mr @entity16 said his confused customers have often assumed there is some connection between his comedy clubs and the tv show , causing major problems for his business			2
denial : @entity4 has denied any copyright infringement and called for @entity10 ' mark to be revoked at @entity37 's @entity36 his barrister said that the company 's mark and that of @entity4 , used on much of its merchandising , share a ' strong visual , aural and conceptual similarity ' for services which are ' in part identical ' and otherwise ' extremely similar '			1
he said : ' the acts of @entity4 have swamped the reputation of @entity10 ' mark and thereby diluted its ability to denote its services			1
' comic enterprises had hoped to keep the costs of the case down by having it heard in the patents county court but a judge moved it to the @entity36 at the studio 's request in march			2
since then , mr @entity16 has accused @entity4 , which has set aside Â£ 750,000 to fight the case , of ' intimidating ' him in what he brands a ' @entity123 ' tussle			1
' legal costs matter to this @entity125 , ' mr @entity38 said , ' given the recent threats made against mr @entity16 personally - the suggestion being that , if @entity10 lose , @entity4 will try to take away his home			2
' but the studio denies any such threats , as well as the alleged trade mark infringement and passing off			2
@entity132 , for @entity4 , said the contentious marks are ' plainly different ' and leave almost no scope for people to muddle the two			2
he said : ' there is no evidence of genuine or properly substantiated confusion and no likelihood of confusion			0
' a fleeting , momentary or speculative thought about whether there might be a connection can not be consistent with the requirement that there be damage to the essential function of the trademark			0
' he put forward evidence from the show 's co-creator , @entity151 , who said he picked the name for its ' double - meaning ' of slang for choir groups and ' sinister joy or shadenfreude '			0
mr @entity132 argued that @entity10 ' mark is descriptive and should be invalidated in relation to singing groups and revoked for all goods except for comedy clubs and live music venues			0
the legal battle continues just as shocked fans of the tv show are coming to terms with the death by drink and heroin overdose of @entity171 , who played @entity172 .			0

comic @entity174 , has four clubs under its trademark @entity3
@entity4 has denied any infringement of trademark
