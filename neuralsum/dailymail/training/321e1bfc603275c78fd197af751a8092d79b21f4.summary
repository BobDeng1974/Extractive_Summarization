the actions of the officers , who occupy senior positions at three forces , are being examined by an independent watchdog			1
they include @entity17 chief constable @entity16 , the @entity18 ’ spokesman on policing ethics , and his deputy @entity21			1

he was gunned down by a ‘ firing squad ’ after being driven to a country lane in @entity31 in 2002			2
questions have been raised over the complex six - year inquiry which a senior judge praised as ‘ extremely skilful ’			2
the convicted killers ’ legal teams brought the case to the @entity38 over fears that key information was not disclosed ahead of the trial			2
under investigation : chief constable @entity16 , right , and deputy chief constable @entity21 , left , are two of four senior officers under the microscope judges alerted the @entity48 which is responsible for investigating potential miscarriages of justice			1

among the allegations being investigated by his team are claims of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice and misconduct in a public office			0
nine serving or former @entity31 officers have been handed official notices warning them that they are under investigation			0
they include the two @entity17 chief officers , @entity31 assistant chief constable @entity73 and @entity75 assistant chief constable @entity74			1
none of the senior officers , who were told they were under investigation this month , has been suspended			0
but it is extremely rare , and possibly unprecedented , for four officers of such senior rank to be under investigation in such circumstances over the same inquiry			0
all of them have held senior posts at @entity87 in the period since 2002			0
mr @entity16 rose through the senior ranks to become acting chief constable			1
two assistant chief constables are also involved in the @entity55 case - @entity73 from @entity87 , left , and @entity74 from @entity93 @entity1 , 20 , a talented footballer who was once on the books at @entity95 , was shot five times on september 19 , 2002			1
the drug dealer had been released from custody in @entity99 24 hours earlier			0

@entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , 28 , and @entity111 were jailed for up to 28 years each at @entity112 in 2008			0
detectives were initially met by a wall of silence but eventually persuaded a witness to give evidence against the gunmen			0
mr @entity16 became the head of @entity120 in 2009			1
@entity121 said it was ‘ completely confident ’ in mr @entity16 and @entity125 and did not want the inquiry to detract from their daily work			1
@entity126 said the official notices were ‘ not judgmental in any way ’ and the investigation must be allowed to run its course .			0
