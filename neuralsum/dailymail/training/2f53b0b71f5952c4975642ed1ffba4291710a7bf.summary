@entity1 scout @entity0 was at @entity2 against @entity3 on tuesday evening as he ran the rule over @entity5			0
the 26 - year - old @entity7 international has been a target for @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 in recent seasons			1

the @entity29 has been limited to only five first - team appearances for the @entity24 outfit this season having recovered from a broken leg			1
