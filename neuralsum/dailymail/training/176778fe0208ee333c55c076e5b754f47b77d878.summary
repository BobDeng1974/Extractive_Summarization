a three - year - old is giving the performers at @entity2 a run for their money thanks to an impressive wardrobe of homemade costumes designed for her by her mother using ' upcycled ' old clothes and material			1
@entity12 and her parents @entity11 and @entity14 , who are self - confessed ' @entity15 ' , visit one of the @entity18 - based @entity2 parks once or twice a week in order to showcase the youngster 's never - ending collection of @entity2 - inspired ensembles and have , unsurprisingly , become one of the most popular attractions at the tourist site			1
even the professional performers clamor to have their photo taken with the adorable toddler			0
@entity12 has been dressed as everyone from @entity37 character @entity42 ( @entity33 ) and @entity43 ( r ) the prettiest princess : the three - year - old 's favorite costume is princess @entity46 from @entity47 ( pictured ) @entity11 , who is a longtime fan of all things @entity2 and even got engaged at a @entity49 at @entity50 , began creating the costumes for her daughter after she and her husband decided to purchase unlimited annual passes to the park for the whole family			1
and while the @entity12 's well - dressed daughter managed to slip under the radar on her first few visits , it was n't long before her unique outfits became the talk of the park			2
after dressing as @entity65 's @entity64 for the park 's ' @entity66 ' , the young @entity2 fan was even invited to attend a special @entity69 - themed event where she was treated to a tea party with talking tea cup @entity71 , a story from the beautiful @entity74 and a dance with the @entity69			2
but the highlight of the evening , mom @entity11 told the @entity77 , was the standing ovation that @entity12 , who dressed up as @entity74 for the evening , received from her fellow guests as she and the @entity69 made their way through the @entity82 restaurant			2
' the music from the from the movie swelled up and the entire restaurant stood up and applauded our little girl , the beauty and the beast , ' @entity11 recalled			0
in order to document their daughter 's journey through @entity2 characters past and present , @entity12 's parents started an @entity96 account , where they capture every one of the family 's trips to the theme park			1
famous face : @entity12 's unique costumes , including her take on @entity104 's @entity103 ( pictured ) have made her something of a celebrity among the performers and staff members at the park @entity110 : it 's not just the movie 's main characters that @entity11 uses as inspiration for the costumes - even @entity117 's @entity116 ( pictured ) has been included fancy frocks : as well as her glamorous replica gowns , such as her @entity121 dress ( r ) , @entity12 also has a number of outfits which feature the faces of her favorite characters , including @entity126 ( @entity33 ) thus far , their account has amassed nearly 62,000 followers , including a number of staff members from the park			1

some of @entity12 's most popular costumes thus far include a remake of @entity121 's iconic ball gown , a glamorous green @entity35 dress - with matching wings - and a pink satin @entity116 costume , complete with a miniature shepherd 's crook			2
creepy costumes : @entity12 's @entity153 - ready ensemble was more than a match for the @entity156 ' @entity155 part of the @entity2 family : the youngster is friends with almost all of the regular performers at the @entity18 park , including @entity164 ( @entity33 ) and @entity165 ( r ) the star of the show : @entity12 's incredible collection of costumes often eclipses the performer 's professionally - made ensembles and it 's not just miniaturized replicas that @entity11 creates on her sewing machine			1
the crafty seamstress also designs a number of @entity2 - inspired dresses which often feature the faces of some of @entity12 's favorite characters , including @entity126 , the @entity182 's @entity181 and @entity155 from the @entity156			1
' i learned how to sew when i was 18 , ' @entity11 wrote on her @entity96 account			0
' i was given a sewing machine and my boyfriend 's dad ( my father - in - law now ) showed me how to use it			0
i 'm mostly self taught though i credit working at a fabric store for most of my education in sewing ... ' eventually i started sewing for local costume shops and theaters and then professionally on my own a bit			0
i 've been sewing now about 20 years			0
' @entity198 style : from @entity200 to @entity121 , the three - year - old has an outfit to match almost every @entity2 character smiles all round : the performers at the @entity18 park have embraced every one of @entity12 's outfits life is the bubbles ! @entity12 's parents are longtime @entity2 fans and are more than happy to indulge their daughter 's love of the theme park but of all the costumes that @entity12 has worn , it is @entity47 's @entity46 that holds the most memories for the family			1
' [ @entity46 ] was the first princess at the parks that @entity12 went up to all by herself , ' @entity11 said			0
' and they shared a game of peek - a - bo that was truly magical ... ' now they have a thing for looking for wildlife and picking flowers in " the bayou "			0

@entity12 's mother @entity11 makes the costumes using *recycled* clothing and material bought at thrift stores
the @entity2 - *obsessed* family have an unlimited annual pass to the park
