it has long been thought that first - born children are more successful and ambitious than their younger brothers and sisters			1
but a new study has revealed that the elder child 's achievements can help boost their younger siblings exam results by helping them to raise their game , which in turn can help them eclipse the first born 's success			1
researchers are calling it the ' sibling spillover effect ' and could point to why top tennis player @entity17 was eclipsed by his younger brother @entity18 and why @entity19 clinched the @entity21 leadership instead of his older brother @entity22			1
top tennis player @entity17 , right , was eventually outclassed by his younger brother @entity18 , who has won two grand slam titles for the first time ever , academics from the @entity25 examined how the success of first born children in school impacted on their younger brothers and sisters by studying primary school test results and then gcse scores			1
and the data showed that having an older brother or sister boosted a child 's learning with the effect the equivalent of spending an extra £ 670 on the younger sibling 's schooling			2
the effect is even more pronounced in less well - off families showing poorer children benefit more from a having high - attaining older sibling			1
older @entity19 brother @entity22 , right , was tipped to be the @entity21 leader but was pipped to the post by younger brother @entity48 one of the study 's authors @entity51 explained : ' the older sibling ’s achievement may have a direct effect on the younger sibling ’s school grades if the older sibling teaches the younger sibling or helps with homework ; the younger sibling imitates the older sibling , for example in their work style , or conversely tries to be different , for example to avoid competition the older sibling passes on important information about educational choices or school and teachers to the younger sibling			2
' we find that the spillover effect is larger for siblings in families eligible for free school meals , living in deprived neighbourhoods and speaking a language other than @entity79 at home			2
' this means that children from more deprived backgrounds benefit more from a high attaining older sibling than children from more affluent backgrounds			0
' now along with fellow author of the study , @entity90 , ms @entity51 explained that it showed how investing in in children may have multiplier effects through their impact on younger relatives			0
previous studies have seemed to suggest that first borns are usually more successful than their brothers and sisters and often have traits of being more organised and responsible as well as being keen to being in charge			0
while last borns are often described as more rebellious , outgoing , charming and more dependent on others			0
earlier this year another study by the @entity25 suggested that firstborn girls are statistically more likely to be the most highly qualified of all their family			0
the research found older females are 13 per cent more ambitious then firstborn sons .			0

study shows older children help younger siblings boost their achievement
*due* to younger children *wanting* to eclipse their older brothers and sisters
researchers from the @entity25 have *dubbed* it ' sibling spillover '
say it is because older siblings help younger children by teaching them
effect is even more pronounced in larger families that are less well off
