@entity27 , 45 , has sparked outrage for her incendiary comments to the media and now officials say they are probing her possible involvement in the tragedy			0
' [ she ( @entity8 ) is a person of interest that we 're looking at to see if she helped radicalize her son , or had contacts with other people or other terrorist groups , ' rep. @entity45 , a @entity46 from @entity47 , who serves on the @entity48 , said on friday			1
rep. @entity56 , the chairman of the @entity57 , said investigators are looking into whether the mother encouraged her son , @entity36 , to embrace @entity62 extremism			1
outrage : the world has been shocked at @entity8 's claims that the entire @entity3 attack was a setup ( the mother speaking to the @entity69 's @entity68 in @entity16 this week ) family : investigators want to know about the mother 's influence over her sons ( @entity8 , center in an undated photo holding a baby @entity36 , with the boy 's father @entity78 ( left ) and uncle @entity78 ( right ) ' the mother in my judgment has a role in his radicalization process in terms of her influence over him ( and ) fundamental views of @entity62 , ' the @entity91 @entity90 told reporters			1
he added that a team of @entity13 investigators had traveled to the @entity97 region to interview sources who knew the family			1
unnamed officials have also reveled that the @entity5 asked for the @entity102 terror suspect and his mother to be added to a terrorist database in the fall of 2011 , after the @entity16 government contacted the agency with concerns that both had become religious militants , according to officials briefed on the investigation			1
about six months earlier , the @entity115 investigated @entity116 and his mother , @entity27 , also at @entity16 's request , one of the officials said			1
the @entity115 found no ties to terrorism			2
hometown : @entity13 officials are traveling to @entity15 , @entity16 ( pictured ) to interview associates who know the bomber 's mother , @entity8 tip off : officials now say they had been warned about possible ties @entity8 had with terrorism ( pictured , the home of @entity129 , in @entity15 ) the revelation that the @entity115 had also investigated @entity27 and the @entity5 arranged for her to be added to the terrorism database deepened the mystery around the family			1
@entity27 to the news on friday , slamming officials who are trying to implicate her			0
' it 's all lies and hypocrisy , ' she told @entity140 from @entity15			1
' i 'm sick and tired of all this nonsense that they make up about me and my children			0
people know me as a regular person , and i 've never been mixed up in any criminal intentions , especially any linked to terrorism			0
' a former official of the @entity16 government told @entity151 on friday that @entity153 - era distrust may have made @entity13 officials less inclined to act on tips from @entity16 security services about one of the alleged @entity3 bombers @entity159 , a former member of the president @entity160 , told a @entity163 subcommittee on friday that @entity16 and the @entity13 have long viewed each other warily			1
because of that , he said , @entity13 officials , in his words , ' just did n't pay enough attention ' when suspect : both the @entity5 and the the @entity115 were warned about @entity116 by the @entity16 government @entity16 agencies asked the @entity115 and @entity5 to look into bombing suspect @entity116			1
the @entity169 are ethnic chechens from southern @entity16 who immigrated to the @entity102 area in the past 11 years			2
this new revelation shows that both major intelligence agencies were aware of his possible terrorist ties , as it has been reported that the @entity16 contacted the @entity115 about @entity8 earlier that year			1
the @entity115 conducted an investigation and did not find he had any terror connections			2
@entity36 was listed on the @entity13 government 's highly classified central database of people it views as potential terrorists			1
but the list is so vast that authorities did not automatically keep close tabs on him , sources close to the bombing investigation said on tuesday			0
the details come as it 's revealed that @entity16 authorities had contacted the @entity13 government repeatedly about @entity8 's suspected ties to radical @entity62 , according to senators briefed on the @entity115 investigation			1
the @entity115 has previously said that it was only contacted once regarding a potential threat posed by @entity8 , but after an investigation , found nothing of concern			2
following a closed briefing of the @entity202 on tuesday , sen. @entity203 , a @entity90 representing @entity204 , said he believed that @entity16 alerted the @entity13 about @entity8 in ' multiple contacts			1
' revealed : the name of one of the @entity3 bombing suspects , @entity116 , was listed on the @entity13 government 's highly classified central database of people it views as potential terrorists @entity8 , 26 , was killed in a police shootout early on april 19 , while his younger brother @entity37 , 19 , was captured later that day			2
prosecutors say the brothers , ethnic @entity217 who had been living in the @entity13 for more than a decade , planted two bombs that exploded near the finish line of the marathon on april 15			0
sources said @entity116 's details were entered into @entity223 , a database maintained by the @entity225 , because the @entity115 spoke to him in 2011 while investigating a @entity16 tip - off that he had become a follower of radical @entity62			1
warning : officials investigated @entity36 and his mother in 2011 but found no ties to terrorism the @entity115 found nothing to suggest he was an active threat , but all the same placed his name on the ' @entity223 ' list			1
the @entity115 has not said what it did find about @entity8			2
but the database , which holds more than half a million names , is only a repository of information on people who @entity13 authorities see as known , suspected or potential terrorists from around the @entity245 of its huge size , @entity13 investigators do not routinely monitor everyone registered there , said @entity13 officials familiar with the database			1
as of 2008 , @entity223 contained more than 540,000 names , although they represented about 450,000 actual people , because some of the entries are aliases or different name spellings for the same person			0
fewer than 5 per cent of the tide entries were @entity13 citizens or legal residents , according to a description of the database on the @entity225 website			0
the @entity223 database is one of many federal security databases set up after the september 11 , 2001 , attacks			0
the database system has been criticized in the past for being too cumbersome , especially in light of an attempted attack on a plane in 2009			0
intelligence and security agencies acknowledged in @entity151 that they had missed clues to the @entity276 ' underpants bomber ' @entity275			0
officials said after the incident that he had been listed in the @entity223 database			0
@entity280 senator @entity280 said there were problems in sharing information ahead of the @entity102 bombings , too			2
' this is troubling to me that this many years after the attacks on our country in 2001 that we still seem to have stovepipes that prevent information from being shared effectively , ' she said			0
@entity292 was speaking after the @entity115 gave a closed - door briefing to the @entity202 on tuesday , but she did not elaborate			2
bombing suspects : @entity8 , 26 , ( right in black hat ) was killed in a police shootout early on april 19 , while his younger brother @entity37 , ( left in white hat ) was captured later that day however , in the case of @entity116 , the issue appeared to be that because he was not deemed an active threat , his name was only briefly on a list that would have triggered monitoring			0
@entity8 was not put on the ' no - fly ' list that would have banned him from boarding an airplane in the @entity13			2
neither was he named on the @entity310 , which would have required him to be given extra security screening at airports			0
another list , the @entity313 , is a declassified version of the highly classified tide with fewer details about terrorist suspects			0
one source said @entity8 was on this list , too			0
after being put in the tide system , his name was entered in another database , this one maintained by the @entity324 's @entity323 bureau which is used to screen people crossing @entity13 land borders and entering at airports or by sea			0
@entity8 was flagged on that database when he left the @entity13 for @entity16 in january 2012 but no alarm was raised , presumably because the @entity115 had not identified him as a threat after the interview			1
picking a fight : @entity335 argues that the media and ' play actors ' have made up the bombing that left three dead and more than 260 injured when he returned from @entity16 six months later , he had already been automatically downgraded in the border database because there was no new information that required him to continue to get extra attention			2
so he did not get secondary inspection on his re-entry at @entity346 's @entity345			0
it was unclear exactly what the procedure was for such a downgrade			0
@entity351 , deputy director of the @entity115 , defended the @entity115 's performance in the @entity102 bombings at two closed hearings in @entity151 on tuesday			1
while government agencies declined to publicly discuss how the watch list system handled @entity8 , homeland security secretary @entity357 disclosed some details at a separate , open hearing on immigration on @entity361			0
' yes , the system pinged when he was leaving the @entity13			0
by the time he returned , all investigations - the matter had been closed , ' @entity364 told the @entity367 on tuesday .			0

@entity8 and her son @entity36 were added to the @entity5 terrorism watchlist 18 months before the @entity102 bombings
lawmakers say the mother is a ' person of interest ' in the investigation
she is suspected of encouraging her sons to pursue radical @entity62 ideas
officials have traveled to @entity15 , @entity16 to interview her associates
the 45 - year - old said the claims were ' all lies and hypocrisy '
@entity115 had investigated both @entity8 and @entity36 in 2011
*ex-russian* official told @entity151 that @entity153 distrust may have made @entity13 officials less inclined to act on @entity16 's tip
