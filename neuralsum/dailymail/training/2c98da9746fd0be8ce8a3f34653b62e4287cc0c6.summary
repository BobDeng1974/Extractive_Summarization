an invisible shield , some 7,200 miles above @entity0 , has been found blocking ' killer electrons ' from bombarding our planet			1
these electrons can whip around the planet at near - light speed and have been known to threaten astronauts , fry satellites and damage space systems			1
if they hit @entity0 on a large scale , they could knock out power grids , radically change the planet 's climate and drive up rates of cancer			1
the shield was discovered in the @entity21 radiation belts - two doughnut - shaped rings above @entity0 that are filled with high - energy electrons and protons but while scientists know this mysterious shield exists , they are baffled as to how it formed and how exactly it works			1
' somewhat like the shields created by force fields on @entity32 that were used to repel alien weapons , we are seeing an invisible shield blocking these electrons , ' said professor @entity36 from the @entity37			1
the shield was discovered in the @entity21 radiation belts - two doughnut - shaped rings above @entity0 that are filled with high - energy electrons and protons			1
held in place by @entity0 's magnetic field , the @entity21 radiation belts swell and shrink in response to incoming energy disturbances from the sun. they were discovered in 1958 and are comprised of an inner and outer belt extending up to 25,000 miles ( 40,000km ) above @entity0 's surface			1
held in place by @entity0 's magnetic field , the @entity21 radiation belts swell and shrink in response to incoming energy disturbances from the sun ' somewhat like the shields created by force fields on @entity32 ( pictured ) that were used to repel alien weapons , we are seeing an invisible shield blocking these electrons , ' said professor @entity36 the @entity21 radiation belts are two layers of charged particles orbiting around @entity0			1
they are kept in place by the planet 's magnetic field			0
the belts are comprised of an inner and outer belt extending up to 25,000 miles ( 40,000km ) above @entity0 's surface			1
the radiation levels across the belts differ depending on where in the belt they are			0
the belts were discovered in 1958 by scientist @entity21 from the @entity70 while aboard the first @entity72 space mission			2
one theory suggested the particles were accelerated as they entered the belt and were trapped inside			0
the second suggested that particles were created inside the belt and accelerated by a force from within			0
@entity79 sent probes up to track the behaviour of the belts and these satellites have finally proved that electric fields inside the belts tear electrons from atoms and charge them at super speeds			0
last year , professor @entity36 led a team that used the twin @entity91 launched in 2012 to discover a third , transient ' storage ring '			1
this ring is located between the inner and outer @entity21 radiation belts and seems to come and go with the intensity of space weather			2
this ring appears to block the ultrafast electrons from breaching the shield and moving deeper towards @entity0 's atmosphere			1
' it 's almost like these electrons are running into a glass wall in space , ' said professor @entity36			1
' it 's an extremely puzzling phenomenon			0
' the team originally thought the highly charged electrons , which are looping around @entity0 at more than 100,000 miles per second , would slowly drift downward into the upper atmosphere			2
but the impenetrable barrier seen by the twin @entity21 belt spacecraft stops the electrons before they get that far , said professor @entity36			1
the group looked at a number of scenarios that could create and maintain such a barrier			0
the team wondered if it might have to do with @entity0 's magnetic field lines			2
these lines trap and control protons and electrons , bouncing them between @entity0 's poles like beads on a string			2
they also looked at whether radio signals from human transmitters on @entity0 could be scattering the charged electrons at the barrier , preventing their downward motion			2
killer electrons whip around the planet at near - light speed and have been known to threaten astronauts , fry satellites and degrade space systems during intense solar storms but neither explanation held scientific weight , professor @entity36 said			1
' nature abhors strong gradients and generally finds ways to smooth them out , so we would expect some of the relativistic electrons to move inward and some outward , ' he added			0
' it 's not obvious how the slow , gradual processes that should be involved in motion of these particles can conspire to create such a sharp , persistent boundary at this location in space			0
' another scenario is that the giant cloud of cold , electrically charged gas called the plasmasphere , which begins about 600 miles ( 960km ) above , is scattering the electrons at the boundary			0
in march , scientists looking at charged particles in space discovered particle hurricanes surrounding @entity0			2
these highly - charged particles are part of the @entity21 belts			1
since the belts were first discovered in 1958 , astronomers have been trying to trace the source of the super-acceleration			0
the acceleration is so high that satellites have to protect their sensitive components with shielding if their orbit spends significant time in the belt			0
data from @entity79 's twin space probes suggests that these the particles may be supercharged by local acceleration , similar to how hurricanes are driven by the evaporation of warm ocean water on @entity0			0
this theory explains why the belts change shape - because the particles numbers swell and drop in different conditions			0
space scientists believe these findings are significant because they could also be used to explain the high - energy radiation belts that circle @entity191 and @entity192 , as well as around sun - like stars			0
it could be doing this with low frequency , electromagnetic waves that create a plasmapheric ' hiss '			0
the hiss sounds like white noise when played over a speaker , professor @entity36 said			1
while the plasmaspheric hiss may play a role in the puzzling space barrier , professor @entity36 believes there is more to the story			2
' i think the key here is to keep observing the region in exquisite detail , which we can do because of the powerful instruments on the @entity21 probes , ' he said			0
' if the sun really blasts the @entity0 's magnetosphere with a coronal mass ejection ( @entity219 ) , i suspect it will breach the shield for a period of time			2

these ' killer electrons ' whip around the planet at near - light speed
if they hit @entity0 , they could knock out power grids and change its climate
shield was found 7,200 miles ( 11,600 km ) above @entity0 in @entity21 belts
scientists are baffled as to how the shield formed , and how it works
