@entity0 are looking at staging mini-tournaments involving the continent ’s leading clubs outside @entity0 during pre-season , with the @entity5 the most likely location			1
@entity9 football ’s ruling body have been considering ways of increasing global interest in sponsorship and media rights , and elevating games that already involve their marquee teams by giving them @entity0 branding and organisation is the preferred option			2
planning for this initiative started two years ago , when @entity0 examined staging the qualifying rounds for the @entity23 and @entity24 outside @entity0 within a knockout tournament format			2
@entity0 are considering hosting mini tournaments outside @entity0 in the hope they will increase global revenue though that ambitious blueprint could be revisited in future , it was felt taking so many competitive fixtures out of @entity0 was fraught with difficulties			1
nevertheless , countries in @entity35 and the @entity36 , as well as @entity5 , will welcome the current @entity0 thinking			0
@entity0 president @entity38 played the biggest role in persuading @entity40 to stand for the @entity42 vice-presidency seat on @entity44 ’s executive committee			1
@entity46 director @entity45 had long been considered the obvious replacement when @entity49 ’s @entity48 stands down in 2015			0
but he made it clear he was not prepared to be part of a @entity44 regime led by @entity54 , which led to the @entity56 to even consider putting forward a current player in @entity58 for the @entity42 vp election			1
however , the persuasive @entity38 , backed up by @entity56 chairman @entity61 , have changed @entity45 ’s mind , with @entity38 saying he wanted influential @entity64 voices on @entity44 rather than ‘ sheep ’ just following @entity54 ’s lead			1
@entity38 played the biggest role in persuading @entity40 to stand for the @entity42 vice-presidency lord @entity68 has ‘ big problems ’ with @entity5 drugs cheat @entity71 being nominated as one of the @entity74 athletes of the year			1
@entity68 ’s manifesto when he stands for the @entity74 presidency next year , probably against @entity78 ’s @entity77 , is expected to have zero tolerance towards double doping offenders such as @entity71			2
@entity81 chairman @entity68 was axed from the @entity56 ’s inclusion advisory board with indecent speed after breaking ranks to criticise the lack of action on discriminatory issues			2
but while the @entity56 sit on their hands on this subject , the good lord continues to speak out			0
he used the @entity92 ’ conference as a platform to complain about football quartet @entity94 , @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98 not facing charges for a variety of discrimination - related comments			0
@entity74 vice-president @entity68 has questioned @entity71 's nomination for the @entity104 of the year @entity105 the difficulties in discovering what really went on in the flawed elections for the 2018 and 2022 @entity109 was highlighted by @entity111 ’s bizarre appearance at the @entity114 - funded @entity113 conference			1
first ‘ @entity111 ’ was only asked about his football career by moderator @entity116 , despite it being a summit about sports corruption			0
then former @entity119 member @entity111 was ultra evasive when asked by the media about who got his vote for 2018 and 2022 and why he did n’t co-operate with the @entity124 inquiry — which he wants published — until he was banned from football for 90 days			0
the @entity128 store responsible for displaying @entity130 ’s book three days early was the @entity131 branch near @entity132			0
@entity133 has fallen out with @entity134 , who accused him of trying to pick the team @entity137 @entity136 owner @entity133 has fallen out with senior player @entity134 , who was dropped for the past two games			1
and @entity134 , in a stormy confrontation , accused @entity133 of picking the team and is planning to take his complaint to the @entity142			2
the shock appointment of @entity145 ’s tv rights specialist @entity144 as chief executive of the @entity147 does n’t necessarily mean vice-chairman @entity148 , who favoured an outside choice , has won a power struggle with chairman @entity151 , who worked with hot favourite @entity152 at @entity154			0
@entity151 and @entity144 also have a close relationship from negotiating media deals .			0
