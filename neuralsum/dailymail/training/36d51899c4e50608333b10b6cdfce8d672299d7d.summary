i wanted to do the ceremony over the phone			0
’ however , she now believes the phobia is a problem of her past after receiving treatment on the daytime show on friday			1
viewers saw her burst into tears when hosts @entity163 and @entity165 showed her an ice cube before treatment and a nurse had to be called after her blood pressure rocketed and she almost fainted			1
however , after just 40 minutes of treatment with psychotherapists @entity68 and @entity70 she went back on air to demonstrate how she was able to touch an ice cube and even bite an ice - lolly			1
