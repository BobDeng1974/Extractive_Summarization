how would you survive the apocalypse ? stick to conventional weapons ? conserve supplies ? or use light and noise to distract zombies so you can sneak by undetected ? in @entity7 , how you stay alive is entirely up to you			1
but this would not be a true @entity7 game without the franchise ’s delightful zeal for the absurd			2
crash and burn : how you escape the city is left entirely up to you ... and you can be as crazy as you want you can don a full set of knight armor and build a laser sword , put on a luchador mask and pile drive zombies , or strip down to a banana hammock while wielding a fireman ’s axe			1
hours can be spent building insane weapons out of random parts , such as a teddy bear with machine guns strapped to its arms , or joy ride in race cars while plowing through crowds of zombies			2
set ten years after the events of @entity34 in @entity32 , you play a mechanic named @entity36 trying to escape the fictional city of @entity38 , @entity39 before a military strike reduces everything to dust			0
but what it lacks in an original plot , it makes up in other areas			0
take the @entity48 integration , that allows you to set navigation waypoints guiding you and your co-op partner around the city , locate weapon caches , and call in deadly military airstrikes			1
or , when @entity36 discovers a transmitter , an in - game character will call and text your real - life mobile device with advice and hints			0
to complement the sandbox - style gameplay , there are a number of @entity64			0
these include the likes of devastating @entity67 – a hybrid between a motorcycle and @entity70 with flamethrower attachments			0
stunning : dead rising 3 looks much better than the last two games - making the most out of the hardware on what we ’ve seen far , @entity7 could be the @entity76 launch title of choice			1
@entity7 is an @entity76 exclusive released on november 22			1
let us know what you think on @entity80 : @ @entity81 and on @entity82 : @entity83 .			0
