the @entity1 terrorist dubbed ‘ @entity2 ’ has been described as a ' dead man walking ' by commentators as the @entity1 's security services seek to track him down and bring him to justice			2
but while some experts have suggested he has been identified by @entity11 and @entity12 , his sickening appearance in this @entity9 video is a reminder of how much work @entity1 agents must do before they bring his reign of terror to an end			1
the best hope for eliminating him may come from the skies			2
last week it was revealed the @entity23 has begun sorties using drones equipped with the latest cameras and weapons over @entity28 in northern @entity29 – where it is believed @entity9 is holding @entity31 hostages			1
intelligence experts are certain to forensically examine the latest video for new clues as to his whereabouts			1
on first viewing , the outline of the desert background behind @entity56 looks similar to the scene behind @entity59 , the @entity23 aid worker whose beheading was also broadcast online by @entity61			1
the video only shows the bleak ground immediately behind them			2
this would suggest that @entity61 has learned from the video of the beheading of @entity23 journalist @entity37 , where a green plain in the distance was enough to allow computer experts to pinpoint the exact location in the hillsides of @entity28			1
@entity1 and @entity23 security forces are said to have been studying the fighter 's movement , speech and the weapon he used in a bid to work out who he is experts have also called attention to the high level of production in @entity9 videos , which use multiple cameras and professional microphones			1
the militant who appears in the @entity56 beheading video appears similar to the man who featured in recent clips of @entity23 hostages being murdered , a security expert has said			1
@entity93 , senior research fellow at defence think - tank the @entity96 , said there were numerous similarities in the films showing the killings of @entity1 aid worker mr @entity56 and @entity23 @entity37 and @entity59			1
all three open with a media clip of the leader of the hostage 's home country - @entity46 in the first two and @entity105 in the video featuring mr @entity56 - before the captive reads what appears to be a prepared message			1
in each video the militant is dressed in a similar all - black outfit with only his eyes visible , while all three hostages are seen kneeling in orange boiler suits in what appears to be a desert location			2
he speaks with what appears to be a @entity1 accent			0
the apparent killer stands to the left in all of the videos and holds a knife in his left hand			0
mr @entity93 said : ‘ they are posed in a very similar way , opening with a message from @entity46 or @entity105			0
then there is the similarity of having the hostage make a false statement to the camera			2
’ he said he was ‘ pretty sure ’ the same @entity134 fighter appeared in all three videos			0
‘ the voice sounds the same , ’ he said			0
‘ he is clearly dressed in the same manner and his stature looks the same			0
it looks like the same figure			0
they are clearly setting this person up to be a figure			0
’ these are in contrast to the grainy , low - definition videos of other terror groups			0
it is understood that hundreds of @entity149 and intelligence - gathering personnel are currently working in the region in an effort to capture @entity2			0
the operation also involves liaison with @entity156 and @entity157 soldiers			0
they are using an array of sophisticated equipment to track him down and free other hostages			0
jihadi @entity2 is believed to have travelled to the war - torn country from @entity40 over a year ago after becoming radicalised and raising money for the jihadists whilst in @entity1			0
@entity23 authorities believed they had worked out the fighter 's position shortly before the first video - showing @entity23 journalist @entity37 's execution - was released on september 2			1
however , the militants had moved on from the camp shortly before @entity23 commandoes arrived at the scene			1
security forces drew up a shortlist of possible extremists who could be the murderer after mr @entity37 was killed			1
experts then used high - tech analysis of the man in the video 's body and voice to try and narrow down the potential suspects			2
@entity1 's ambassador to the @entity23 @entity190 has told @entity191 that security services in @entity1 and the @entity23 are pumping huge resources into finding out who he is and where he is hiding			1
he said : ' we 're putting a lot into it			0
and there are some very sophisticated technologies , voice identification and so on , which people can use to check who these people are			0
' the masked man , who speaks with a clear @entity40 accent , has appeared in two chilling videos showing him beheading @entity23 journalists and issuing threats to president @entity46			1
the videos have been filmed in barren desert , but experts have gleamed some clues to the group 's location the same killer is thought to have appeared in the first two films - in which @entity37 and @entity59 ( pictured ) were killed , and authorities will now analyse the latest video in a bid to find further clues he was at first suspected to be @entity223 , the so - called ' hip hop jihadist ' who left his £ 1million home in @entity227 to join @entity229 militants fighting for the @entity9 in @entity29			1
however , earlier this month , officials appeared to rule out @entity223 as the killer and focused their attention on another man , whose name has not yet been released			0
they are reportedly confident they have worked out the fighter 's identity using high - tech analysis of his body and voice and do not believe it to be @entity223			0
@entity242 hostages freed earlier this year have identified the man as being one of three jailers they dubbed ' @entity246 ' , who guarded them and oversaw torture and mock executions			2
the militants are thought to be in northern @entity29 , hiding in the swathe of the @entity252 now under @entity9 control during extensive ' debriefings ' with intelligence officers , the hostages were shown pictures of suspected @entity1 and other @entity242 jihadists			2
the former captives are understood to have been able to recognise around eight @entity1 they had ' come into contact ' with during their months of captivity in a dozen locations around @entity29			0
the @entity264 reported earlier this week that @entity11 had identified a prime suspect and was on the verge of arresting known associates still believed to be in the @entity1			1
the latest video of mr @entity56 ' execution will however raise fears that - despite two weeks having passed since the first execution video was released - the killer still appears to be able to carry out further killings .			1

@entity23 forces carried out raid on terrorists ' camp before first hostage was killed
but *mission* failed after the militants moved on before commandos arrived
shortlist of suspected killers has been assembled since first execution video
it was claimed this week that @entity11 had identified the executioner in the films
but latest video will add to *urgency* of attempts to locate killers
