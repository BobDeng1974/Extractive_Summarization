one of @entity1 's most powerful space telescopes has turned its gaze on the @entity3 for the first time to capture this stunning image			0
@entity1 's @entity6 , or @entity6 , has produced the most sensitive solar portrait ever taken in high - energy x-rays			1
the mission is primarily designed to look at black holes and other objects far from our solar system			1
the @entity6 data , seen in green and blue , reveal solar high - energy emission ( green shows energies between 2 and 3 kiloelectron volts , and blue shows energies between 3 and 5 kiloelectron volts )			1
the @entity6 data , seen in green and blue , reveal solar high - energy emission ( green shows energies between 2 and 3 kiloelectron volts , and blue shows energies between 3 and 5 kiloelectron volts )			1
the high - energy x-rays come from gas heated to above 3 million degrees			1
the red channel represents ultraviolet light captured by @entity20 at wavelengths of 171 angstroms , and shows the presence of lower - temperature material in the solar atmosphere at 1 million degrees			2
this image shows that some of the hotter emission tracked by @entity6 is coming from different locations in the active regions and the coronal loops than the cooler emission shown in the @entity20 image			2
' @entity6 will give us a unique look at the sun , from the deepest to the highest parts of its atmosphere , ' said @entity49 , a solar physicist and member of the @entity6 team at @entity53 , @entity53			1
solar scientists first thought of using @entity6 to study the sun about seven years ago , after the space telescope 's design and construction was already underway , but before the telescope launched into space in 2012			1
@entity49 had contacted the principal investigator , @entity61 of the @entity62 in @entity63 , who mulled it over and became excited by the idea			0
' at first i thought the whole idea was crazy , ' says @entity69			0
' why would we have the most sensitive high energy x-ray telescope ever built , designed to peer deep into the universe , look at something in our own back yard ? ' @entity49 eventually convinced @entity69 , explaining that faint @entity75 flashes predicted by theorists could only be seen by @entity6			1
while the sun is too bright for other telescopes such as @entity1 's @entity79 , @entity6 can safely look at it without the risk of damaging its detectors			1
the sun is not as bright in the higher - energy x-rays detected by @entity6 , a factor that depends on the temperature of the sun 's atmosphere			1
this first solar image from @entity6 demonstrates that the telescope can in fact gather data about sun. and it gives insight into questions about the remarkably high temperatures that are found above sunspots -- cool , dark patches on the sun. future images will provide even better data as the sun winds down in its solar cycle			1
' we will come into our own when the sun gets quiet , ' said @entity49 , explaining that the sun 's activity will dwindle over the next few years			2
with @entity6 's high - energy views , it has the potential to capture hypothesized nanoflares -- smaller versions of the sun 's giant flares that erupt with charged particles and high - energy radiation			1
@entity115 , should they exist , may explain why the sun 's outer atmosphere , called the corona , is sizzling hot , a mystery called the ' coronal heating problem			2
' the corona is , on average , 1.8 million degrees @entity122 ( 1 million degrees @entity123 ) , while the surface of the sun is relatively cooler at @entity126 ( 6,000 degrees @entity123 )			0
it is like a flame coming out of an ice cube			0
@entity115 , in combination with flares , may be sources of the intense heat			0
the new telescope ( right ) offers deeper , crisper images of the sky - and will help @entity1 hunt down ' hidden ' objects such as black holes which could help unravel the mysteries of the universe			1
the @entity6 , @entity6 x-ray telescope is 100 times more sensitive than any previous telescope operating in the same energy range ' we will see the hottest , densest and most energetic objects with a fundamentally new high - energy x-ray telescope that can obtain much deeper and crisper images than before , ' said @entity61 , @entity6 's principal investigator at the @entity62 in @entity63 , who first conceived of the mission 20 years ago			1
the telescope has more than 10 times the resolution , and more than 100 times the sensitivity , of its predecessors operating in a similar energy range			0
studying black holes that are big and small , far and near , @entity6 will endeavor to answer questions about the formation and physics behind these wonders of the cosmos			1
the observatory will also investigate how exploding stars forge the elements that make up planets and people , and it will even study our own @entity3 's atmosphere			0
if @entity6 can catch nanoflares in action , it may help solve this decades - old puzzle			1
' @entity6 will be exquisitely sensitive to the faintest x-ray activity happening in the solar atmosphere , and that includes possible nanoflares , ' said @entity49			1
what 's more , the x-ray observatory can search for hypothesized dark matter particles called axions			0
dark matter is five times more abundant than regular matter in the universe			0
everyday matter familiar to us , for example in tables and chairs , planets and stars , is only a sliver of what 's out there			0
while dark matter has been indirectly detected through its gravitational pull , its composition remains unknown			0
it 's a long shot , say scientists , but @entity6 may be able spot axions , one of the leading candidates for dark matter , should they exist			1
the axions would appear as a spot of @entity75 in the center of the sun. meanwhile , as the sun awaits future @entity6 observations , the telescope is continuing with its galactic pursuits , probing black holes , supernova remnants and other extreme objects beyond our solar system			1
this 04 november , 2003 image shows giant sunspot 486 ( lower - r ) 486 unleashing another powerful solar flare			2
ionizing radiation hit @entity221 's atmosphere soon after the explosion and caused a severe radio blackout , which radio listeners noticed across @entity225			2
solar flares can damage satellites and have an enormous financial cost			0
astronauts are not in immediate danger because of the relatively low orbit of this manned mission			0
they do have to be concerned about cumulative exposure during space walks			0
the charged particles can also threaten airlines by disturbing the @entity221 â€™s magnetic field			2
very large flares can even create currents within electricity grids and knock out energy supplies			0
a positive aspect , from an aesthetic point of view , is that the auroras are enhanced			0
geomagnetic storms are more disruptive now than in the past because of our greater dependence on technical systems that can be affected by electric currents			0
the images comes weeks after warnings that @entity221 could be hit by a series of damaging solar flares after the largest sunspot to be seen on the star for 24 years aligns with our planet			1
the sunspot , previously known as @entity259 12192 , began facing @entity221 in october but did not produce any coronal mass ejection ( @entity261 )			1
cmes are the most energetic events in our solar system , involving huge bubbles of plasma and magnetic fields being spewed from the sun 's surface into space			1
the region , renamed @entity259 12192 , has now rotated around to face @entity221 again , and is likely to create @entity261 , @entity1 scientist @entity271 told @entity273 during a video interview			2
' this time around , it 's more likely to have some coronal mass ejections associated with it , even though the solar flares might be smaller , ' she said			0
' we have a good idea , based on the structure of that magnetic field and the sunspot , that it 's very possible that it will create some mid-level flares			0
' magnetic fields in sunspots can store vast amounts of energy , but looping magnetic field lines can get tangled up and snap , releasing their energy as explosions called flares			2
according to dr @entity293 , the sunspot is still large enough for 10 @entity221 to fit inside it , and is believed to be the 33rd largest of 32,908 active regions recorded since 1874			2
the @entity296 - sized sunspot produced six eruptions in october and early november , before disappearing for two weeks			0
earlier this year , @entity298 , who is a member of an international task force , dubbed @entity300 , warned that solar ' super-storms ' pose a ' catastrophic ' and ' long - lasting ' threat to life on @entity221			1
a solar superstorm occurs when a @entity261 of sufficient magnitude tears into the @entity221 's surrounding magnetic field and rips it apart			2
@entity221 could be about to be hit by a series of damaging solar flares as a huge sunspots aligns with the planet such an event could induce huge surges of electrical currents in the ground and in overhead transmission lines , causing widespread power outages and severely damaging critical electrical components			1
mr @entity298 , carrying out doctoral research in aerospace engineering at @entity321 , said it is only a ' matter of time ' before an exceptionally violent solar storm is propelled towards @entity221			2
he says such a storm would wreak havoc with communication systems and power supplies , crippling vital services such as transport , sanitation and medicine			0
without power , people would struggle to fuel their cars at petrol stations , get money from cash dispensers or pay online , ' he said			0
' @entity341 and sewage systems would be affected too , meaning that health epidemics in urbanised areas would quickly take a grip , with diseases we thought we had left behind centuries ago soon returning			0
' the largest ever solar super-storm on record occurred in 1859 and is known as the @entity351 , named after the @entity353 astronomer @entity352 who spotted the preceding solar flare			0
this massive @entity261 released about 1022 kj of energy - the equivalent to 10 billion @entity358 bombs exploding at the same time - and hurled around a trillion kilos of charged particles towards the @entity221 at speeds of up to 3000 km / s. however , its impact on the human population was relatively benign as our electronic infrastructure at the time amounted to no more than about 124,000 miles ( 200,000 km ) of telegraph lines			1
mr @entity298 says these types of events are not just a threat , but inevitable			0
@entity1 scientists have predicted that the @entity221 is in the path of a @entity352 - level event every 150 years on average			1
this means that we are currently five years overdue - and that the likelihood of one occurring in the next decade is as high as 12 per cent .			2

@entity6 primarily designed to look at black holes and other objects far from our solar system
scientists pointed it at the sun to produce the most sensitive solar portrait ever taken in high - energy x-rays
expected to reveal major new insights into how sunspots form - and how they could harm @entity221
