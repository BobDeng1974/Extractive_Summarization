a @entity1 reporter detained in @entity2 has been charged with espionage and collaborating with ' hostile governments ' , nine months after his arrest			1
the charges against @entity8 had been shrouded in secrecy until now in what has become a politically sensitive case that has parallelled with high - level nuclear talks between @entity2 and global powers , including the @entity14			1
monday , @entity8 's lawyer @entity15 detailed the four serious offences her client faces , in a decision branded absurd monday by the @entity19 and the newspaper			1
as well as allegedly spying under the first two charges , the 39 - year - old journalist , the @entity1 's @entity22 correspondent , stands accused of gathering classified information and of disseminating propaganda against the @entity27 republic			1
@entity32 , who said she had access to the complete criminal file , said it contained ' no justifiable proof ' against @entity8 , and that she had seen no legal reason to continue his detention after the case 's preliminary investigation			2
but she said requests for bail had been turned down and criticised @entity2 media for publishing allegations about @entity8 that are ' wrong and contrary to reality '			1
no date has yet been set for trial , @entity32 said , shortly after a senior judicial official described the dossier against the journalist , who holds both @entity14 and @entity2 nationality , as ' thick '			0
@entity8 will face the allegations in one of the @entity58 's revolutionary courts , whose jurisdiction includes handling crimes against national security			2
its cases are heard behind closed doors			0
however @entity32 said : ' @entity8 is a journalist and the nature of his work is to have access to information and to publish it			1
he had no access to confidential information , either directly or indirectly			0
' @entity8 was detained in @entity22 on july 22 last year , along with his @entity2 wife @entity71 , also a journalist , who was released on bail after spending two - and - a - half months in custody			1
@entity8 is being held in the capital 's notorious @entity74 and his family have frequently spoken of their fears for his health , citing his need for medication to combat high blood pressure			2
but @entity32 said he was ' in good spirits ' despite being held in cramped conditions			0
he has also had no access to newspapers or media			0
his mother @entity88 said she had discussed the charges with the journalist 's wife , who remains in @entity22 , but had no further comment			2
the reporter 's detention has political resonance both because of his dual nationality and the long - running nuclear talks regarding @entity22 's disputed nuclear programme			2
@entity19 spokesman @entity99 said it had no official confirmation of the allegations , but if reports of @entity8 being accused of spying were true it would be ' absurd ' and that the charges should be ' immediately dropped '			1
but the journalist 's predicament would have no bearing on a nuclear deal either way , he added			0
@entity2 's foreign minister @entity112 last week said the reporter faced ' very serious ' allegations but it was a matter for @entity2 's judiciary , insisting the case was free of political interference			0
@entity32 also said the allegations against her client ' had no link ' with the nuclear talks , but in a nod to the diplomacy she added : ' i hope this matter will accelerate the liberation of my client			0
' @entity2 's foreign minister @entity112 ( pictured ) last week said the reporter faced ' very serious ' allegations but it was a matter for @entity2 's judiciary in a rare official comment regarding @entity8 , @entity135 , @entity22 's judiciary chief , said monday : ' the file is thick and contains different aspects			1
' quoted by the official @entity139 news agency , he added : ' in due course the judgment will be pronounced			0
' in a statement , the @entity1 's executive editor @entity142 said : ' the grave charges against @entity8 that @entity2 has now disclosed could not be more ludicrous			1
' it is absurd and despicable to assert , as @entity2 's judiciary is now claiming , that @entity8 's work first as a freelance reporter and then as @entity147 's @entity22 correspondent amounted to espionage			1
' @entity8 was among four @entity14 citizens that president @entity152 last month urged @entity2 to return home			0
on april 2 , @entity2 and world powers agreed the key parameters for a deal that would end a 12 - year standoff about concerns that @entity2 is seeking a nuclear bomb , an allegation it denies			0
a final agreement is due by the end of june .			0

@entity8 faces trial for collaborating with ' hostile governments '
the @entity22 correspondent is accused of gathering classified information
he has been in jail for nine months with requests for bail denied
