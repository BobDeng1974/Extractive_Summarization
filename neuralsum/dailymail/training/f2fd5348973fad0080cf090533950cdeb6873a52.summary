by @entity0 published : 07:10 est , 18 april 2013 updated : 07:52 est , 18 april 2013 a tear rolled down @entity3 's cheek during the early stages of the service at @entity6 it was one of the most memorable moments of @entity10 ’s funeral , when @entity3 was seen with tears rolling down his cheek			1
today @entity13 defended the chancellor ’s public display of emotion , insisting everyone should have ‘ the liberty to cry if they want to ’			1
a clearly emotional mr @entity3 was seen trying to blink away tears before wiping his eyes during the moving address by @entity24 @entity23			1
the chancellor was visibly moved during the early stages of the service paying tribute to @entity30 's first female prime minister			1
he later hinted at his dramatic moment of emotion , writing on @entity33 that it had been a ' moving , almost overwhelming day '			2
mr @entity13 was asked during his weekly @entity35 phone - in if he had also cried			1
the @entity37 leader said : ‘ no i did n’t but it was a very powerful occasion and very full of ceremony			2
’ he went on : ‘ you ’ve got to give any man or indeed woman the liberty to cry if they want to , i do n’t think you should criticise someone for showing emotion			1
’ mr @entity3 and mr @entity13 were among 32 serving members of the @entity47 who joined prime ministers past and present , world leaders and some of the key figures who played a role @entity10 's downfall more than two decades ago			1
political friends and foes were among the 2,300 mourners who came together to mark the passing of the longest serving premier for 150 years			2
the chancellor hinted at his moment of emotion later in a tweet @entity13 , appearing on his @entity35 phone - in , said he did not cry during yesterday 's spectacular ceremony but insisted it was wrong to criticise those who did last week mr @entity3 hailed @entity10 as ' a great prime minister — probably the greatest in our peacetime history '			1
he added : ' we are fortunate to live in a country she did so much to transform			2
' i do n’t think that we in this generation of politicians need to be unsettled by living in her shadow			2
we do live in her shadow and we should just embrace it			2
' she was a great prime minister - probably the greatest in our peacetime history - and we are fortunate to live in a country she did so much to transform			1
' @entity79 , who gave a reading during the service , was also seen wiping his eyes			1
he earlier declared ' we 're all @entity83 now ' as he hailed the @entity10 's legacy as irreversible			1
cabinet office minister @entity85 appears to wipe away a tear during service while a stern - looking @entity88 looks on prime minister @entity79 appears to wipe away a tear as he stands with his wife @entity90 and former premier sir @entity91 at the service while the last 10 days have been dominated by debate over @entity10 ’s policies and long - term impact on @entity30 , mr @entity79 said that no one in mainstream politics would argue for a return to the 1970s			1
‘ in a way we are all @entity83 now because one of the things about her legacy is that some of those big arguments that she had everyone now accepts , ’ he told @entity102			2
‘ no one wants to go back to trade unions that are undemocratic or one - sided nuclear disarmament or having great private sector businesses in the public sector			1
’ but mr @entity13 insisted he was not a thatcherite			1
‘ he ’s the leader of the @entity112 he ’s perfectly entitled to say that			2
i certainly would n’t call myself a @entity111			2
i ’m a @entity116 , i ’m a @entity116 , she was n’t a @entity116			0
i ’ve always called myself a @entity116 i always will			0
’ mr @entity3 , seated behind @entity118 and sir @entity91 , raised his right hand to dry his cheek though only a robot can claim never to cry , no @entity121 likes to do so as publicly as an emotional @entity3 did at @entity10 ’s funeral yesterday			1
we feel a sting of shame – but then catharsis , our emotional gutters having been given a good wash			1
the chancellor was seen to wipe away a tear in @entity6 , visibly moved by proceedings			1
he later hinted at his dramatic moment of emotion , writing on @entity33 that it had been a ‘ moving , almost overwhelming day ’			0
to water up so openly might be thought weak and womanly – histrionic , even , if we contemplate some ululating @entity135 ever bewailing his lot			0
but the rarer the tears , the more potent they can be			0
after all , would we really want a chancellor who was incapable of sorrow ? in my view , it can be the making of a man of a certain age to be seen ‘ emoting ’ in public , when the circumstances call for it			1
recently my wife and i were at a school concert			0
without warning our 15 year - old son clambered on stage and sang a solo with his electric guitar			1
he has been playing the instrument for only a couple of years and we had no idea he was capable of such a performance			0
@entity160 has had a few problems in life – he has autism , which can stifle a child ’s social confidence and communicative abilities			0
to see our fine boy stand there and belt out @entity170 , bending his spine as he reached for artistic expression , was a lip - wobbler for me			1
i saw him as a success , as a lad with prospects			0
tears dripped off my cheeks , raindrops off a sycamore leaf			0
typical theatre luvvie , you might think			0
as the @entity186 ’s drama critic i am frequently a bit damp around the optics			0
i have become as leaky as a punctured garden hose			0
or is it age ? parenthood does it to you			0
the other sunday my teenage daughter read the lesson in church – that passage about @entity199 recognising @entity200 and gasping , ‘ my lord and my @entity202 ! ’ she read it so beautifully , with such grace , i was a-jibber			0
at funerals the @entity206 ’s ancient sentences as the priest enters always make the spine tingle but tears prickle when it comes to singing			0
such memories can be evoked			0
@entity214 and @entity215 , to @entity217 ’s tune , is how we saluted my father ’s silent coffin			0
@entity222 ’s @entity221 is always a challenge			0
we may not know , we can not tell , why @entity3 wept yesterday			0
was it purely for @entity10 or had the majesty of her funeral reactivated some more personal sadness ? perhaps both			0
i last had to reach for a discreet hanky when at the superb @entity231 production of @entity232 in the night - time ( which , as it happens , is about autism )			2
the convenient thing about theatres , like most churches , is that the layout of the seating means only your neighbours can see that your goggles are filling with briny			0
unless , of course , you are chancellor and a national tv camera is filming your every moment			2
the former prime minister made a huge impact on the country - and thousands arrived to pay tribute to the former @entity112 leader			1

chancellor *welled* up during emotional service at @entity6
prime minister @entity79 also appeared to get emotional
@entity13 says he did *n't* cry - but it 's wrong to criticise those who did
