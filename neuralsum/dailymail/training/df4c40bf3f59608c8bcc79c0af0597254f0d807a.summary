earlier this season i picked @entity2 as my greatest - ever @entity4 striker			2
one look at the tributes paid to him on tuesday show plenty of people would agree			2
@entity12 , power , skill , intelligence — it was the perfect combination			2
but he backed up all that talent with trophies			0
when he was in the zone , he was almost unstoppable and single - handedly won us matches on more than one occasion			0
@entity23 's @entity22 ( left ) runs to celebrate with @entity2 ( right ) during a @entity25 win @entity22 ( centre ) and @entity2 ( right ) were team - mates at @entity28 , where the striker became a living legend when he arrived , i sat with him in the stands at a testimonial			1
he spoke little @entity34 but he was purring over @entity36 ’s movement			0
if he can learn the punditry game as fast as he did the real one , he ’ll be the best in the business by next @entity41 ! the club asked if i would let him have my no 14 shirt because @entity2 wanted it			1
i was after @entity44 ’s old no 5 so i agreed , although i ’m sure people will remember him wearing 14 more than me ! he is still the best athlete i ’ve ever seen wear a pair of football boots and when he scored his first goal i said i ’d be able to tell my grandchildren i had played with him			1
he gave me a puzzled look			0
after the career he had , maybe now he sees why			0
@entity23 columnist @entity22 still believes @entity2 is the best athlete he 's ever seen on a football pitch			1

@entity23 columnist @entity22 was *honoured* to play with the legend
@entity2 *announced* his *retirement* from football on tuesday
@entity22 let @entity2 have his no 14 shirt in *return* for @entity44 's @entity63
@entity23 's @entity22 *admits* the @entity65 is the best he played with
