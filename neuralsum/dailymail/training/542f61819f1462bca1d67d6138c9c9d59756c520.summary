the summer transfer window would n't be the summer transfer window without @entity2 flexing their financial muscle			1
last year they broke the world transfer record to sign @entity6 from @entity7 for £ 85.3million			2
fast forward 12 months and more global stars are joining			0
they have signed @entity11 winner @entity10 from @entity12 for £ 24m and are trying to complete a £ 63m deal for world football 's new kid on the block @entity17			1
as if their @entity29 winning squad was n't strong enough already			0
but just how will @entity21 pick his strongest starting @entity30 next season with so much world class talent at his disposal ? here , @entity34 has a stab at doing the @entity37 's job for him			1
not bad , huh ? even with @entity41 's front line of @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 , @entity21 's new look side has the potential to go all the way domestically and @entity48 again next season			1
for £ 20m , @entity10 is perhaps the most value for money signing of the summer , his displays in @entity50 are testament to that			2
the midfielder is the heir to @entity56 's central midfield throne , though the @entity58 maestro can still expect ample playing time next season			2
and if @entity2 's move for @entity27 star @entity17 comes off , then their front four will be one of the most feared on the continent			1
his displays in the no 10 role for a @entity66 were a highlight of the @entity11			0
and who knows how far the @entity69 would have gone if their main goal - poacher @entity26 were fit			0
so to combine that with the attacking prowess of @entity73 and @entity6 then you 've only one outcome : goals			0
@entity2 closing in on @entity17 prolific : @entity26 scored 52 goals in 68 games during two seasons in @entity79 with @entity80 @entity82 wizard : world record signing @entity6 enjoyed a fine first season at @entity2 in 2013 - 14 the world 's greatest : @entity87 forward @entity86 won the 2013 @entity88 and if for whatever reason that starting @entity30 does n't work out then @entity21 need n't worry too much			1
to replace @entity90 in goal read @entity92 , to step in for @entity93 or @entity94 in central defence you have @entity97 , if the central midfield is n't quite working perhaps @entity56 , @entity99 or @entity100 could do a better job , and there 's always @entity103 to step in up front			0
it 's a tough life being @entity21			2
spoilt for choice : real manager @entity21 will have an embarrassment of riches at his disposal			0

@entity10 has signed for @entity2 in £ *24million* deal
@entity17 wanted next for £ 63m from @entity27
@entity11 stars will join @entity86 and @entity6 at @entity2
@entity27 *striker* @entity26 also wanted by @entity2
@entity34 looks at @entity21 's potential xi for next season
