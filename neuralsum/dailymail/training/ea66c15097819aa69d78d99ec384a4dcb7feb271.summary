it was half past midnight on saturday when @entity1 made his way to the @entity4 team bus after his post-match press conference and admitted : ‘ normally i would have watched @entity6 and gone to bed by now			1
’ one of the culture shocks for anyone new to @entity10 is that just as the rest of @entity14 is going to sleep , the saturday night late kick - off in @entity12 is just going into injury time			0
@entity1 had just seen his team secure a point against @entity18			2
it was n’t the win @entity21 , sir @entity22 and @entity23 all managed on their @entity10 debuts , but it did match the point @entity24 picked up in his first game in charge of @entity4 , and he went on to win the @entity27 there , so the omens are not all bad			2
@entity1 took charge of his first game since becoming @entity4 boss earlier in november @entity1 looked focus as he entered the @entity34 as his @entity4 side travelled to @entity18 the 51 - year - old gave a wave to the cameras as he prepared for his first game managing in @entity12 's top flight @entity1 was involved in a heated exchange with @entity18 assistant @entity42 in the first half @entity4 winger @entity44 ( right ) dribbles past two @entity18 defenders during the @entity10 clash @entity4 had the better of the first half with former @entity47 forward @entity48 and one - time @entity50 midfielder @entity49 both going close			1
the visitors did n’t have it all their own way , though , and goalkeeper @entity53 was called on to keep out efforts from @entity18 left back @entity55 and on - loan @entity57 midfielder @entity56			0
@entity1 ’s side tired after a testing second period , desperately throwing their bodies in front of shots to earn a draw			2
but @entity1 was positive that the 90 - minute intensity he demands from his teams will come			1
‘ some people might think you will only find the tiki - taka style here but there is an intensity to the @entity74 game , too , ’ said @entity1 ( above )			1
‘ you see that with @entity76 , @entity57 and @entity77			2
as well as moving up the all - time scoring charts during @entity57 ’s 4 - 0 win , @entity78 reached 20 league goals before the end of november — becoming the fastest player ever to reach the total , taking just 11 games			1
it was the 11th consecutive game in which he ’d scored and at this rate he would finish with around 70 for the season , beating @entity90 ’s record of 50 in 2012 - 13			1
elsewhere in @entity10 , champions @entity76 beat @entity91 3 - 1 in a fiery encounter at the @entity93 , in which both sides had a man sent off			1
the result keeps them within four points of top spot			0
‘ i have some incredibly talented footballers here and the playing style is good , but they also want to play with intensity and pressing and they also do n’t have a problem with hitting a longer pass when it is right to do so			0
’ @entity107 will become easier as @entity1 spends more time with his squad			2
he admitted after his first game : ‘ it is not easy at the start because the players probably are n’t even understanding how i ’m shouting their names at the moment			0
’ he was also looking to the future when he said he hoped to turn several members of his squad into @entity12 internationals , emulating the success he had with individual players as @entity122 coach			0
at @entity123 he helped players such as @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128 earn call - ups for their countries , and the @entity131 said : ‘ i would like to think that my reputation for making players better , and in some cases , converting them into internationals , is pretty good			0
‘ i have some good young players here and the academy here is really good			0
( @entity139 ) @entity138 is a good young player and @entity140 is another			0
@entity78 reached 20 league goals before the end of november becoming the fastest player to do so ‘ my challenge is to turn them into international players in the coming 18 months			1
i have done it with one or two others so hopefully i can do it with them as well			0
’ his debut was n’t quite the winning starts @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 achieved at @entity77 and @entity152 respectively , though it did represent @entity4 ’s first clean sheet since april			1
it was also memorable from the moment the team plane touched down ... and then took off again at @entity157 ’s airport on saturday morning			0
‘ the weather was so bad the plane could n’t land — it came down and went back up again twice , ’ said @entity1			0
‘ we ended up having to land at a different airport			0
’ performance of the weekend @entity90 breaks records at such a rate that it ’s easy to get blasé , but this one really is special			2
his hat - trick in a 5 - 1 win over @entity167 brought him to 253 goals in 289 league matches , beating @entity171 ’s league record of 251			1
@entity172 , whose mark for @entity152 lasted 59 years , played until he was 36 ... @entity90 is 27			0
@entity78 , meanwhile , with two goals against @entity175 on saturday , moved to 197 @entity10 goals — ninth on the all - time list			1
the @entity57 man is two years @entity90 ’s senior but has achieved his total in around half the time as the @entity181			1
@entity90 is thrown into the air by his team - mates after he broke @entity171 ’s league record of 251 goals			1

@entity4 had the better of the first half with @entity48 and @entity49 both going close
@entity1 confident that the 90 - minute intensity he demands from his team will come
