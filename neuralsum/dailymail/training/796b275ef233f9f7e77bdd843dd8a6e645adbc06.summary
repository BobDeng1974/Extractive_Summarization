a new chemical could make human teeth ' cavity proof ' - and do away with the need for visits to the dentists forever a new chemical could make human teeth ' cavity proof ' - and do away with the need for visits to the dentists forever			1
the molecule has been called ' @entity10 ' - after the 32 teeth in a human mouth			1
the chemical was designed by dentists in @entity14 , and wipes out all the bacteria that cause cavities in just 60 seconds in tests			2
the chemical could be added to any current dental care product , turning toothpaste , mouthwash and chewing gum into ' super cleansers ' that could get rid of the underlying cause of tooth decay			2
the chemical targets ' streptococcus mutans ' , the bacteria that turns the sugar in your mouth into lactic acid which erodes tooth enamel			1
by exterminating the bacteria , ' keep 32 ' prevents the damage to teeth before it happens			0
using a product containing the chemical keeps your teeth ' cavity proof ' for several hours			2
the product has been under test for seven years , and is now going into human trials			0
it could be on the market in 14 to 18 months , say researchers @entity47 from @entity49 and @entity50 from the @entity51			0
the chemical could even be added to foods to stop bacteria damaging teeth as you eat			1
the researchers hope to licence the patent to chemical giants such as @entity59			0
' we are currently in talks with five interested in investing in our project or buy our patent , ' say the researchers .			0

@entity65 could be added to toothpastes in year *'s* time
*kills* bacteria that erode teeth
single dose *protects* mouth for hours
' @entity10 ' chemical could even be added to foods
