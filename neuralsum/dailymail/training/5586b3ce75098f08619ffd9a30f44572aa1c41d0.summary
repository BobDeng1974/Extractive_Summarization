by @entity0 hundreds of @entity1 on a day - trip to @entity3 today feared they would not get home for @entity5 after their return flight was cancelled			1
the fed - up tourists were this afternoon waiting to find out when they would be flown home - nearly a whole day after their plane was due to take off			1
more than 200 passengers were put up in a hotel near the airport in @entity14 , @entity15 , last night - but only after spending more than four hours sitting in the stationary plane			1
@entity17 and @entity18 with their two children @entity19 and @entity22 families were left waiting for four hours before being told they would have to stay overnight at a hotel desperate to get home are @entity17 and @entity18 , who took their two older children on the day - trip - but left their 20 - month - old twins behind			1
@entity18 , 30 , said : ' this is my worst nightmare			1
we only left the twins because we thought we 'd be back the same day			1
' they are being looked after by my sister , but i 've never left them this long and i 'm desperate to get home			1
' at the moment i 've no idea when that will be , i 'm not even sure we 'll be back for @entity5			1
' the couple from @entity39 , south east @entity40 , paid £ 1,700 to take @entity22 , eight , who has autism , and @entity19 , five , on the dream trip to see @entity5 in @entity3			1
@entity18 , who booked the trip through @entity44 , said : ' it was meant to be a once - in - a - lifetime fairytale trip , but it 's been awful			2
' even the trip itself was disappointing			2
i thought @entity3 was going to be magical , but it 's been a disaster			1
' we had to wait outside in minus 30 degrees in a queue to see @entity5 and when it was finally the kids ' turn i fainted because i was so cold			1
' we were told we would be having snowball fights with elves , but the elves were moody and would n't even talk to us			0
' there was n't even a christmas tree and i did n't see any fairy lights - it was pitch black			0
' the family got an early morning @entity66 flight out of @entity67 on saturday and were due to fly back at 7.50pm the same day			2
@entity18 said : " we boarded the plane at 7pm , but it never took off			2
we were sat on the tarmac until 11pm wondering what was happening			0
' they refused to give us any food and drink while we were waiting - it was just awful			0
i 've never heard so many children crying all at once			0
' apparently the valve that stops the engine from freezing was faulty and they just kept telling us they were trying to fix it			0
originally meant to be a day trip , the @entity3 visit has turned into a disaster for many families ' eventually they took us off the plane at 11pm and put us up in a hotel			1
' they 've told us we will get an update on what is happening at 4pm today so all we can do is wait			0
' we ca n't leave the hotel because it 's too cold outside and they 've taken away our snow suits			0
" a spokeswoman for @entity44 said this afternoon they hoped to be able to send the passengers home on a 4.30pm flight			2
she said : ' we have had two staff with our clients at the hotel all day keeping them updated			0
' fingers crossed all the passengers should be heading home on a 4.30pm flight			2
' she added she was " stunned " to hear about the @entity110 's disappointing @entity3 experience			0
she said : ' i am really disappointed to hear this			0
not one single complaint has come to our ears			0
' historically we have had really good feedback from our @entity3 tours			0
' a @entity66 spokeswoman said a plane was due to depart from @entity14 either late afternoon or early evening to return the 235 passengers to @entity67			1
she said : ' we are doing everything we can to make their plane ready for departure as soon as possible			2
' we 've provided overnight accommodation , meals and drinks to ensure passengers are comfortable and we expect to have them back in @entity128 by the end of the day , in plenty of time to enjoy @entity5 at home			1
