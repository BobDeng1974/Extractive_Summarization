the cost of a daily lunchtime takeaway can be crippling and yet instead of making lunches at home the majority of @entity6 workers still pop to the high street to grab their midday meal			1
the ' meal deal ' ( which is not always a meal , or a deal ) has seen us stave off the hunger pangs with soggy sandwiches , slimy salads and salty soups , spending an average of £ 1,840 a year			1
but we could save up to £ 1,300 a year if we just prepared our lunch at home			1
cheese , crackers and charcuterie is a simple and delicious lunch which can be easily assembled in the office food website @entity27 's ' @entity26 ' series demonstrates just how simple it can be to bring healthy , cost - effective , and delicious lunches to work			1
these incredibly detailed ideas and recipes show how to make everything from easy - to - assemble options such cheese and crackers , to more complicated steamed @entity37 buns , and @entity39 banh mi sandwiches each recipe on @entity27 is contributed by a member of the team who promises to keep your midday meals ' both interesting and pretty			1
' if you 're after something simple , cheese , crackers and charcuterie will do the job			1
simply choose your favourites , assemble and eat ; and if you 're vegetarian , swap meat for pickled vegetables and you 're good to go			2
make something complicated like stuffed dumplings ( left ) or keep it simple with a toast tartine ( right ) @entity58 has some inspired combinations which include @entity60 , apple , and bacon jam ; mozzarella and prosciuotto or manchego and dried apricots			1
keeping with the theme , you could also use the handy cracker to spread a variety of toppings			2
make a @entity71 salad cracker with cucumber , olive tapenade and feta ; a hummus cracker with roasted red pepper on top ; pesto crackers with thinly sliced prosciutto ; or smashed avocado crackers			1
do n't feel like spreading ? dip instead ; simply decant your spreads into containers and away you go			2
workers could save up to £ 1,300 a year if they prepared their lunch at home instead of buying pre-packed sandwiches and snacks from shops , research by vouchercloud.com revealed			1
more than 60 per cent of @entity6 who buy their lunches out spend an average of £ 1,840 a year , based on 46 working weeks , the research reveals			1
in comparison , those who prepare food at home spend just £ 552 over the same period - a saving of a whopping £ 1,288			1
the startling difference came to light following a poll of adults across the @entity6 , which found that a fifth of @entity6 choose to purchase their work - time lunches as opposed to making them at home			1
pita bread is also another wonderful lunchtime option and can be stuffed with any number of fillings , from hard boiled eggs , smoked meat and charred vegetables			1
experiment with flavour combinations ; stay @entity114 with aubergine with chickpeas and coriander or keep it @entity6 with thinly sliced roast chicken , crisp lettuce and sweet baby tomatoes			1
remember , anything you can put into a sandwich can be stuffed into a pita			1
still sound too complicated ? try turning toast into a tartine			1
spread with butter or mayonnaise and top with thinly sliced vegetables ( radish and chicory , dressed lightly in lemon juice and olive oil work really well against crisp , hot toast ) or layer slices of ham , chopped up dates and a salty cheese to make something a bit more glamorous			1
the site also has more complicated options for those who have time on their hands and want to experiment			1
steamed pork buns , which are traditionally eaten as a breakfast food in @entity148 are self - contained dough parcels which can be filled ( bao ) or unfilled ( mantou )			1
@entity151 from @entity27 writes : ' your first option is to go with the basic , unfilled mantou dough , then customise it to your heart 's content			1
' steamed @entity37 buns ( bao ) are usually stuffed with meats such as roast pork and stir - fried mushrooms you can stuff your bun with anything you like including pork , vegetables and even mushrooms , before you steam them			1
freeze after steaming to keep them fresh and warm them in the office microwave			2
looking for something even more exotic ? author of @entity172 has a brilliant @entity39 sandwich recipe which should satisfy the fussiest of lunchtime eaters			2
banh mi rolls are the @entity39 take on the baguette and typically contain @entity180 fillings such as pickled vegetables , chillies and coriander as well as roast meats			2
the bread is usually scooped out so that it resembles a cradle which your fillings can be placed in			2
to make sure your sandwich does n't go soggy , pack your vegetables separately and assemble when you get to the office			2
buns or banh mi not doing it for you ? stuff some dumplings instead			1
' the best part about dumplings is that you can use anything to make fillings			0
i tend to lean towards two of my favorites : pork and chives for my meat option , and chives , egg , and vermicelli for my vegetarian option -- but these are only two out of numerous recipes out there , ' @entity212 of @entity27 writes			1
