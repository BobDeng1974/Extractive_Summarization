the parents of a four - year - old who was successfully treated with proton beam therapy have spoken of their disgust at the way the parents of @entity7 have been treated			1
@entity8 was diagnosed with a rare type of brain tumour when she was just 15 - months - old , but was given @entity12 funding for the £ 50,000 treatment			1
the @entity15 toddler was flown to the @entity17 state of @entity18 in may 2011 to receive the treatment and will today start primary school thanks to the therapy			1
lilly with her parents @entity22 and @entity24			0
her proton beam therapy successfully removed a brain tumour @entity27 pictured in may 2011 on her way to the airport for her proton beam therapy in @entity18 @entity27 pictured in @entity31 in @entity15 prior to her radical treatment overseas @entity27 , pictured left at a hotel room in @entity18 during her 33 - session treatment that vastly improved her quality of life , and on the right , after some treatment at @entity31 , in @entity15 , in 2011 yesterday parents @entity24 and @entity22 told of their horror at how @entity42 and @entity43 had been treated in their fight to save their sons life			1
mrs @entity8 , who is a stay at home mother , 27 , believes there should be more @entity12 funding for the proton beam therapy treatment			1
she said : ' i feel for the @entity7 family because they 're just parents that want their child to live for the longest he can and i 'd do the same in their shoes			1
' they 're trying to do what 's best for their child			0
that 's their little boy and any parent would do the same			1
' i agree that the doctors know best but if someone is saying , " yes there is a treatment there but you 're not having it " , that 's unfair			2
' @entity27 pictured six weeks ago with her patient liason team at the @entity77 the @entity79 family together at their home in @entity15 ( left ) and @entity27 playing with her toys ( right ) mrs @entity8 first noticed that @entity27 was ill in october 2010 when she stopped eating , walking and talking , and began vomiting			1
in february 2011 , she was diagnosed with ependymoma , a rare form of brain tumor that affects one in 68million			0
doctors advised that proton beam therapy was the best course of treatment and her parents were successful when they applied for @entity12 funding			1
three months later , @entity27 , was sent from @entity93 to a treatment centre in @entity18 , @entity17 , for the proton beam therapy the toddler , from @entity97 , @entity15 , received a 33 - session treatment across eight weeks and the tumour was successfully removed			1
although the couple were relieved that @entity27 's funding was approved , they have found it difficult to accept that other children were rejected			1
mrs @entity8 said : ' @entity105 went up to the hospital board against another little girl and @entity27 got the yes and the little girl got a no , and when we got back from having the treatment , the little girl had died			1
that was so incredibly sad			0
' mr @entity79 , 36 , agreed : ' for anyone to be told they ca n't have that treatment , that 's devastating , especially after knowing how well it has worked for @entity105			2
' as far as taking the child out of hospital , for me that 's a massive act of desperation			0
@entity27 and her parents @entity22 and @entity24 were lucky to get approval for @entity12 funding for the £ 50,000 treatment @entity27 , pictured at her @entity15 home , is required to undergo scans every three months ' we had moments where we did n't agree with the doctors and what they were doing but we sat there and debated it with them and luckily they took what we said on board			1
' @entity142 therapy is a type of radiation therapy which uses beams of protons directed precisely at a tumour			2
the beams are more focused and less likely to damage healthy tissues around tumours when they destroy cancer cells			0
unfortunately , @entity27 's type of cancer is classed as terminal and the tumour will eventually start to grow again			1
but her parents say the therapy has given her a better quality of life			2
mr @entity79 added : ' before the therapy she would be in bed all day			2
she was n't able to speak or walk but now she is bubbly and loves to play with her sisters			0
' there was none of the sickness you get with conventional radiotherapy			0
' there is no knowing how long we have her for but people with ependymoma have been known to live until 40			0
' @entity27 has scans every three months to check that the tumor is stable but try not to think about the future too much and just take each day as it comes			0
' ever since the treatment she 's been healthy			2
' consultant paediatric oncologist , @entity177 , from @entity93 , insisted a child 's referral for proton treatment was treated on a case - by - case basis			1
he said : ' the selection process for proton treatment is based individual cases and the type of tumour			2
@entity27 is about to start school today after undergoing the radical treatment as a baby in 2011 lilly with her mother @entity190 at home			2
mrs @entity8 said @entity27 is now bubbly and loves to play with her sisters @entity24 and @entity22 were relieved @entity27 's funding was accepted but found it hard to see others rejected by @entity12 ' there is a national panel review for all the referrals in the @entity200			1
a hospital team can refer patients when they feel will meet the panels criteria for treatment			0
' in @entity207 's case , ependymoma is a condition which the panel would be open to treating			0
however that referral would be based on strict criteria the patient has to meet			0
' this includes the patient being well enough to travel , no evidence that the disease is spreading and how big and where the tumour is located on the brain			0
' generally speaking if all these criteria are met then it would be a case for referral			0
' protons work like radiotherapy but are used to target a more focused area , in the case of some tumours the whole brain needs treating which would mean proton treatment is no more affective than radiotherapy			0
' in the case of @entity233 , which is different , his condition may not fall under the criteria			0

@entity15 four - year - old successfully treated with proton beam therapy
@entity8 was approved for @entity12 funding for the £ 50,000 treatment
her parents disgusted at the way @entity7 's parents have been treated
@entity190 : ' that 's their little boy and any parent would do the same '
unfortunately , her tumour is terminal and is expected to one day return
