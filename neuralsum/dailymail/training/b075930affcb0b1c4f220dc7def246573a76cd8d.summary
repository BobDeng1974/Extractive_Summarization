by @entity0 @entity1 , pictured last year , is rebelling against civil servants ' order that he must be chauffeur - driven between his office and the @entity5 when politicians are embroiled in rows over @entity10 chauffeurs , it is usually because they have abused the privilege			1
but not so colourful home office minister @entity1 , who is rebelling against an order to use a driver by demanding that officials provide him with a ‘ ministerial bike ’ instead			2
the @entity16 , whose appointment to @entity20 ’s team was the biggest shock of the autumn reshuffle , says civil servants have told him he must be chauffeured the quarter - mile between his desk at the @entity25 and the @entity26			1
when he told them that he would rather pedal and asked them to provide a bicycle , they refused – on the grounds that it would be an ‘ unacceptable burden ’ on the taxpayer			1
last night , mr @entity1 hit out at what he described as a ‘ ridiculous , @entity38 jobsworth ’ attitude			1
‘ i object to the fact that they are trying to put me into a car with a chauffeur against my will , ’ he said			0
‘ i pointed out that it would be much quicker and cheaper for me to cycle			0
but they said that while the car was already paid for , providing a bike would be an additional cost to the taxpayer			0
‘ it would be cheaper and also better for the environment			0
’ mr @entity1 , 56 , added : ‘ i could provide my own bike , but i regard it is a matter of principle			1
’ it is understood that the row has gone all the way to @entity59 , the @entity60 ’s director general of propriety and ethics , who has backed the officials			0
and last night the @entity25 , which spends £ 136,000 a year on chauffeuring its ministers around , was sticking to its guns			1
one of mr @entity1 ’s own spokesmen said : ‘ ministerial travel is governed by the @entity66 , which states that arrangements must be efficient and cost - effective			2
the minister said he would rather cycle the quarter - mile distance between his desk at the @entity25 and the @entity5 ( pictured ) ‘ providing bicycles would mean additional and unnecessary cost to the department when arrangements are already in place			0
for short journeys , and where practicable , ministers can walk or use public transport			0
’ mr @entity1 ’s appointment was surprising because he once wrote a book claiming @entity84 spies covered up the death of dr @entity86 , who exposed @entity88 ’s ‘ dodgy dossier ’ on @entity89			2
however , sources say relations between mr @entity1 and mrs may are ‘ surprisingly cordial and pragmatic ’ .			2
