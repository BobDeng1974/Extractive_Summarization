similarly , almost half of the @entity1 is using maps and navigation functions to find their way around during their holiday			2

thirty - nine per cent regularly make sure the sun will be shining versus only 33 per cent updating their social profiles , while away			0
' we are entering a new era where people are move fluidly across desktop , phone , tablet , even wearables as they plan , book and then ultimately take their trip , ' said @entity169 , managing director of @entity170 ' travellers are not only researching and booking trips on mobile , but they ’re also complimenting their meals , and capturing every trip detail			0
