by @entity0 published : 11:29 est , 21 february 2014 @entity2 : 14:28 est , 21 february 2014 @entity3 has finally opened up about her unretouched @entity5 photos , which were leaked by @entity6 last month after the site placed a $ 10,000 bounty on the original images			1
the 27 - year - old creator of @entity11 told @entity13 editor @entity12 in a podcast released on thursday that she was ‘ kind of scared ’ to see the images , but after noticing how they were minimally retouched she ‘ felt completely respected by @entity5			1
’ ‘ they smoothed a line here and shaved off part of my neck , ’ miss @entity3 said of the changes the magazine made to her cover shoot			2
” ’ rather than unearth a great discrepancy between reality and distortion , as was @entity6 ’s intention , the release of @entity5 ’s unretouched images actually drew a large backlash			1
readers and media outlets alike questioned the site ’s famously feminist morals , as well as its motives for seeking out , and later releasing , the photos			0
miss @entity3 herself called the stunt ‘ messed up			0
’ ‘ i think @entity6 can be really smart and funny … i think it ’s just like , once you ’ve been attacked in that way , it ’s hard to enjoy , once you feel like they ’ve made such a monumental error in their approach to feminism			1
i just ca n’t be half - in … it felt gross , ’ she explained			1
at the time , @entity63 labelled @entity6 as ‘ vindictive ’ for ‘ handing over a $ 10,000 reward to whichever underpaid assistant in @entity5 's photo department risks their job to cough up the photos ’			1
writers at @entity68 felt similarly , saying that the site ’s move was ‘ so far from okay ( delete extra unneeded sentence ) ... there ’s nothing wrong with wanting to look better than your best when you ’re doing a @entity5 photo shoot			0
in the same way there ’s nothing wrong with @entity3 getting decked out at award shows			0
’ proud of her form : miss @entity3 has never been one to shy away from displaying her body , and often appears in various states of undress on her @entity85 tv show @entity86 also wrote a story with the headline , ‘ @entity3 's @entity5 cover : was the photo editing that bad ? ’ an outpouring of @entity93 response even saw @entity6 users attest that they were boycotting the site in protest of its hunt for miss @entity3 ’s photos			2
miss @entity3 , herself , does not feel all that dissimilar : ‘ instead of going , “ hey we kind of f * * * * * up , these photos are not that retouched			0
@entity3 go enjoy the @entity5 spread that you ’ve been excited about since you were eight years old , ” they were like , “ she is not retouched , but she could have been			0
” ’ the young actress and director says that she felt the site ’s handing of the photos ‘ was this weird political maneuvering that i had a lot of trouble respecting			2
’ the photos in question were featured in @entity5 ’s february issue – one which is already being switched out at newsstands for the magazine ’s march issue staring @entity120 .			0

the 27 - year - old creator of girls also noted that @entity6 's $ 10,000 bounty on the images was a ' monumental error of feminism ’ and ' felt gross '
