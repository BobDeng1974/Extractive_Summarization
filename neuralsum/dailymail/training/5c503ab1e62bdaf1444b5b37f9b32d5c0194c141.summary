oldest case in @entity1 : the 2,250 - year - old @entity3 mummy , which revealed tell - tale signs of prostate cancer under high - powered digital imaging scientists believe they have discovered the oldest case of prostate cancer in @entity1 after scans on a 2,250 - year - old mummy showed the man died a slow and painful death from the disease			1
the unnamed @entity3 mummy , which is kept at the @entity16 of @entity17 , had a pattern of round and dense tumours between its pelvis and lumbar spine - giveaway signs of man 's modern - day killer			1
the mummy was that of a 5ft 5ins adult male ‭ who lived between 285 and 230 @entity29 and was between 51 and 60 years old when he died , researchers said			1
' the bone lesions were considered very suggestive of metastatic prostate cancer , ‭ ' ‬ wrote the researchers in the @entity33 of @entity34			0
they subjected the mummy , known as @entity43 , to powerful @entity41 ‭ ( ‬ @entity36 ‭ ) ‬ scans , which produced ‭ ' really unusual high quality images ' , @entity38 , ‭ ‬ a radiologist at @entity40 in @entity17 , told @entity44			2
@entity45 showed that @entity46 had been buried with crossed arms ‭ - a common pose in @entity3 mummies , ‭ ‬ although in the @entity51 it was often associated with royals ‭			0
he was adorned with a cartonnage mask and bib , ‭ ‬ and boasted an elaborately painted shroud			0
the images showed he suffered from lumbosacral osteoarthritis , ‭ ‬ which was probably related to a lower lumbar scoliosis and there were several ‭ post-mortem fractures , ‭ ‬ possibly produced when the mummy was transported to @entity64			0
but they also found a variety of tumors , ‭ ‬ measuring between ‭ ‬ 0.03ins ‭ ‬ and ‭ ‬ 0.59 ‭ inches , ‭ ‬ interspersed ‭ along ‬ @entity32 s pelvis and lumbar spine			1
‭ prostatic carcinoma begins in the walnut - sized prostate gland and typically spreads to the pelvic region , ‭ ‬ the lumbar spine , ‭ ‬ the upper arm and leg bones , and the ribs , ‭ ‬ ultimately reaching most of the skeleton			2
‭ agonising end : the mummy , known as @entity43 , was a 5ft 5ins adult male who died a painful death at the hands of the disease aged between 51 and 60 dr @entity38 and colleagues ‭ ‬ considered other diseases as alternatives			1
‭ ‬ but ‭ ‬ @entity43 ‭ ' ‬ s sex , ‭ ‬ age , ‭ ‬ the @entity85 distribution pattern of the lesions , ‭ ‬ their shape and density , ‭ ‬ strongly argued for prostate cancer			0
' it is the oldest known case of prostate cancer in ancient @entity1 and the ‭ ‬ second ‭ ‬ oldest case in history , ‭ ' dr ‬ @entity38 said			1
the earliest diagnosis of ‭ ‬ metastasising prostate carcinoma came in ‭ ‬ 2007 ‬ when researchers investigated the skeleton of a ‭ ‬ 2,700 - year - old @entity105 king who died , ‭ ‬ aged ‭ ‬ 40 to 50 , ‭ ‬ in the steppe of @entity107 , ‭ ‬ @entity108			2
‭ ' this study shows that cancer did exist in antiquity , ‭ ‬ for sure in ancient @entity1			1
‭ ‬ the main reason for the scarcity of examples found today might be the lower prevalence of carcinogens and the shorter life expectancy , ‭ ' ‬ @entity118 , ‭ ‬ a researcher in @entity120 , ‭ ‬ told @entity44			0
moreover , ‭ ‬ high - resolution ct scanners , ‭ ‬ able to detect tiny ‭ ‬ tumors ‭ only ‬ became available only in ‭ ‬ 2005			0
, which suggests earlier researchers may have missed them .			0

scans reveal tumours between pelvis and spine
man died slow , painful death in his 50s
