vital ( @entity37 for advancing life sciences ) will analyse trends in databases of life science companies in an effort to predict successful investments			2
the bot has already helped make two major investment decisions in life science companies , @entity47 and @entity48			2

eventually , the software is expected to get an equal vote on all financial decisions made by the company the long - term goal is to get @entity13 ’s intelligence to the stage where it can operate autonomously when making investment decisions			1

a mathematical framework for consciousness , developed over the last decade by @entity100 at the @entity101 , says that the ability to integrate information is a key feature of consciousness			0
he believes that integrated information ca n't be broken down into smaller components in conscious minds , because the brain contextualises information			0
