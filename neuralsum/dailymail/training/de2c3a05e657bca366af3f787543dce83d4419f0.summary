by @entity0 for @entity1 it might be unbelievable looking at her flawlessly toned body , but @entity4 claims that her passion for exercise , workout empire and even her latest appearance on gymnastic reality show tumble , all originated from her cellulite			1
the 22 – year - old shot to fame on @entity14 is @entity15 , but says it was precisely the lifestyle she was leading on the show - which involved a fair bit of drinking at nightclubs - that gave her the wake up call she needed			1
speaking to women ’s fitness , the star says ‘ i did n’t train at all			1
i was one of those girls who had the gym membership , but never went			0
and one day i was like , “ ok i ’m thin , but i ’m unfit , i ’m unhealthy and i ’m starting to get cellulite – i need to do something			1
however her enviable figure is the result of some serious dedication , both in the gym and the kitchen			0
‘ i love core work ! i ’m a really strange person who loves ab pain ! ’ she says			1
@entity37 agrees : ‘ if i say , “ @entity4 what do you want to do : 20 press - ups or hold plank ? ” she ’ll always say plank ! ’ @entity37 says : ‘ i tend to do 30 - minute interval - training sessions with all my clients			1
’ but @entity4 wanted more ! ‘ i started doing 30 minutes , but then i wanted an hour ! ’ she says			1
‘ once you start seeing improvements in your body , you want to do more			1
’ ‘ you ca n’t out - train a bad diet			1
@entity4 says that as tough as training for @entity63 's tumble has been , it has given her a new body confidence ‘ i love eating clean now			1
i would never ever go back			0
obviously i have treats , the same as everyone else : on the weekend i ’ll have a dessert if i go out for dinner			0
but you know when you ’ve eaten something bad - when you read the back of processed food packaging and there ’s 25 ingredients , you know it ’s not going to be good for you			1
‘ everything i eat i usually make from scratch			1
eating and nutrition are so important , especially if you ’re training			1
‘ i like stir - fries because they ’re quick and i ’m busy			1
‘ quinoa is my new best friend			2
i have it at breakfast for energy because i train in the mornings			0
i have quinoa , smoked salmon and scrambled egg			0
it ’s on our @entity92 plan			0
’ but despite now spending a large portion of her time working out , @entity4 says that she has found the training for @entity63 ’s tumble gruelling , but that it has whipped her into her best shape ever and given her a new body confidence @entity4 warns that no matter how much exercise you do , you ca n't out train a bad diet and need to eat well simple exercises , like this plank back - kick , that can be done at home are part of the reason ' results with @entity4 ' has become such a sucess ‘ i ’m loving the training because i ’m getting more definition			1
i ’m using muscles i never knew existed			0
i like that feeling of feeling strong and i guess it makes me feel more confident , ’ @entity4 says			2

’ with the semi-finals for @entity130 kicking off next week , the bar was raised on saturday night ’s episode			2
despite gaining immense confidence since her first week , @entity4 ’s seductive ribbon routine failed to impress the judges			0
the beauty had to face off against @entity136 , whose trampoline routine was the lowest - scoring of the night			2

bend the knee of the left leg as low as you can go , keeping your back leg extended and the foot on the floor			0
keep a straight back throughout and your arms out stretched in front			0

slowly lift your legs to a 45 - degree angle , keeping them straight			2
bend your knees and bring your knees toward your chest until your hips are at a 90 - degree angle			0
