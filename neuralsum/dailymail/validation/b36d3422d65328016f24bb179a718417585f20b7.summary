families crossing the channel by @entity2 or ferry face @entity4 misery after ministers insisted on introducing new exit checks during one of the busiest getaways of the year			1
queues of up to five miles and lengthy delays are predicted when the new regime starts on april 8			2
under the new rules , the passport of every passenger in a car or coach will have to be individually scanned			1
ministers insist that knowing who is leaving the country is vital for counting the number of immigrants in @entity22 and fighting crime and terrorism			1
nightmare journeys : @entity26 has claimed new border control rules will cause huge delays leaving the country with ' coachloads of little old ladies bearing the brunt ' but even though no checks have taken place over the past 17 years , the @entity33 decided the best date to reinstate them should be on the second week in april – when vast numbers of @entity22 head to the continent during the @entity4 school break			1
ferry companies warn that holidaymakers will be held in queues on the @entity43 in @entity44 , blocking the route between @entity46 and @entity47 during one of the busiest times of year			2
mps on the home affairs select committee were sent a letter from the @entity22 @entity53 claiming trials had shown that queues of at least 650 vehicles would form on busy days			1
@entity57 , the chamber ’s policy director , said : ‘ the model showed that , with tourist and freight check - in transactions extended by exit checks , the queue of traffic heading for the port of @entity46 would extend at least 8km , blocking the @entity43 almost as far as @entity47			2
’ @entity2 calculates the new system will quadruple the time taken to get vehicles onto shuttle trains			1
buses with 30 or more passengers on board will take even longer			1
checking a car on to a @entity76 train takes 15 seconds at the moment			0
but passport checks on up to five passengers will stretch that closer to two minutes , adding to delays			2
@entity2 public affairs director @entity81 said : ‘ you only have to multiply the number of people in each vehicle – five six or seven in a car or 30 or more in a coach – to see how this will play out			1
protective measures : the checks start on april 8 and @entity2 and ferry companies will be checking the passports of all those leaving the country to tighten national security ‘ that increases the risk of congestion and delays			1
that ’s the risk we are trying to mitigate			0
but the risks are significant			0
’ advice : immigration minister @entity102 told the today programme that people should set out on their journeys earlier to avoid delays ministers were last night under pressure from mps to make exceptions to the rules , such as large coach parties			1
interviewed on @entity114 ’s today programme yesterday , immigration minister @entity102 twice hesitated before saying passengers should set out early on their journeys			2
quizzed a third time , he said : ‘ on busy days i think it is advisable for anyone to set out earlier to ensure that they are at their ports of departure on time			0
’ he denied there would be chaos , insisting : ‘ there are often queues at both @entity2 and also @entity46 in terms of their day - to - day operations			1
’ in the event of huge queues , managers on the ground will not have the authority to relax the checks			0
they would have to seek personal approval from a minister or government official			0
transport bosses say the april 8 deadline has been imposed for political reasons so ministers can say they have exit checks in place before the general election			2
the original date they had in mind was april 1 – just two days before @entity148 – but implementation was delayed by a week when the @entity33 was warned the consequences would be even worse			0
despite the inconvenience caused by the checks , the @entity33 will still not have a full picture of who is in the country			0
the checks do not apply to journeys to @entity158 or travel by private aircraft or boats			0
airports are not likely to be hit by the checks			0
@entity163 said it did not anticipate ‘ any disruption or any visible changes to passenger journeys ’			0
a spokesman for the hub said 96 per cent of flights already collect advance passenger information .			0

*unpopular* new measure to be introduced at @entity22 borders in @entity4 break

@entity26 claims it is ' little old ladies ' who will suffer under the new rules

but ministers say it is vital for counting the number of immigrants in @entity22
