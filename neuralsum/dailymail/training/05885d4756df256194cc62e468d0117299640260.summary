by @entity0 @entity3 ’s @entity2 preparations suffered a major embarrassment on wednesday when police were forced to disperse supporters after racial abuse was aimed at the team ’s star striker @entity8			1
@entity8 was shocked to hear at least one fan shout out ‘ f * * * ing n * * * * ’ as he took part in a sprinting exercise with his team - mates at the @entity16 complex near @entity17			1
the 23 - year - old @entity8 , who was less than 50 metres away when the insults were hurled , immediately complained to nearby team - mates , and police were called to break up a group of around 20 fans including schoolchildren who had gathered in a street overlooking @entity16 to watch training			1
disgusting : @entity8 suffered racial abuse from his own supporters during @entity3 's @entity2 training camp afterwards , team - mate @entity29 said : ‘ in 2014 , we should n’t need to be talking about racism again			1
‘ we did n’t speak to @entity8 about it afterwards because i think he agrees with me , we do not want to give any importance to these people			2
‘ at the moment , there is a problem with chants about black people			0
fortunately , @entity8 was very calm			2
we had a meeting when we met up about behaviour and not reacting , and he acted the right way			0
‘ we know it is a very bad thing but we do n’t want to give publicity for the people who do it			0
’ yesterday , @entity8 limited himself to telling team - mate @entity47 ‘ i only ever get this in @entity49 or @entity17			1
’ @entity3 has a long - standing problem with racism and @entity8 was abused by @entity53 fans during a game for @entity55 in 2013			1
he made a ‘ shh ’ gesture with his lips after he and team - mate @entity58 were greeted by monkey noises and @entity8 said afterwards he would walk off the pitch if he encountered it again			1
@entity29 , who could partner @entity8 up front when they play @entity64 in their first match of the @entity2 in @entity66 on june 14 , added : ‘ i ’m not ashamed to be @entity67 because of this but i am sad when these things happen			2
we should try to use our role to improve behaviour , so people do n’t do it			0
’ not happy : @entity8 told team - mates he only receives this kind of abuse when in @entity17 or @entity49 the incident took place less than an hour into the second day of manager @entity81 ’s @entity2 bootcamp , at around 10.45am local time			1
the manager himself was not close to @entity8 at the time and said he did not hear any racial slur , though he said he did hear other messages of encouragement for his striker			2
it ’s been a bumpy start all round for the @entity67 preparations			0
on tuesday , goalkeeper and captain @entity93 – one of four survivors from their 2006 @entity2 squad – announced he was separating from his wife @entity97 , forcing @entity81 to say the split would not affect his preparations for @entity100			0
@entity8 is also in the middle of a legal battle to see more of his 18 - month - old daughter @entity103			2
the striker is well - known to @entity106 fans having won the @entity107 and @entity108 with @entity109			0
looking ahead : the former @entity109 striker is likely to hold the key for the @entity67 this summer he returned to sign for @entity55 at the beginning of last year and though his form last season was patchy , he is a certainty to make @entity81 ’s final cut of 23 because of his performances at @entity118			1
but the @entity67 manager has other decisions to make whittling down his provisional squad of @entity122 currently has seven strikers in his party and when asked if he would go to the @entity2 , @entity29 – @entity128 ’s top scorer last season with 22 goals for @entity130 – quipped : ‘ the only certainties are life and death			0
’ @entity81 will snub the chance to watch @entity64 play @entity135 at @entity136 on friday , may 30			0
he will be in @entity137 for @entity3 ’s game the following night against the @entity139 , but will spend the evening with his players at @entity141 , the venue for that match .			0

@entity146 striker was abused when training with @entity3
