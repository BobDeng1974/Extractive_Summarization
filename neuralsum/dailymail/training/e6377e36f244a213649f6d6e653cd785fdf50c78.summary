by @entity0 published : 05:28 est , 14 august 2013 updated : 03:12 est , 15 august 2013 the @entity2 ’s first cat dna database has been set up to help solve criminal investigations – after cat hair was successfully used to trap a killer			1
the database , which currently holds records of 152 pets ’ dna , was started after hairs were found on the dismembered body of @entity12			1
mr @entity12 ’s torso was discovered in july 2012 wrapped in a curtain containing eight cat hairs			1
breakthrough : @entity17 , left , has been convicted for manslaughter after hairs from his pet cat were discovered on the dismembered torso of @entity12 , right genetic tests suggested they could belong to @entity23 , a cat owned by a suspect called @entity17			1
@entity27 police sent the hairs to @entity29 for analysis where scientists examined the cat ’s dna			1
the results confirmed that @entity23 had the same rare genetic code as the hairs found on the body			1
scientists were able to prove that the variety was unusual , by showing that none of the 493 randomly sampled animals in a @entity42 cat database shared the same type of @entity9			2
to help strengthen their case in court , police were keen to know if the result would also be rare in the @entity2			0
they tracked down dr @entity49 – who had created a similar database of @entity2 dogs while working with the @entity52			2
dr @entity49 said : ‘ @entity27 police wanted to know the evidential strength of the match			0
i explained that could only be determined with reference to a database of @entity2 cats – which did not exist at the time			2
’ the team were able to get 152 samples from a company that analyses blood samples for vets			0
only three of the samples matched the hairs from the crime scene			0
this confirmed that the @entity9 type was also rare in the @entity2 , making it easier to prove that the hairs came from the suspect ’s cat			1
the evidence was presented at @entity76 as part of the prosecution case that successfully convicted @entity17 of manslaughter			2
dr @entity49 said : ‘ this is the first time cat dna has been used in a @entity2 criminal trial			1
we now hope to publish the database so it can be used in future crime investigations			0
' this could be a real boon for forensic science , as the 10 million cats in the @entity2 are unwittingly tagging the clothes and furnishings in more than a quarter of households			2
' @entity92 : mr @entity12 's body was found wrapped in a curtain on a beach in @entity96 in july last year			1
this picture shows detectives carrying out a fingertip search of the beach although the @entity42 and @entity101 have used cat hair in crime cases before , the findings have never been collated in one database			0
dr @entity49 said : ' having produced a similar database for dogs during my previous employment with the forensic science service , we proposed creating a cat database from scratch			0
' within each cat hair are two types of dna , individual - specific " nuclear dna " detectable in the roots of some larger hairs , and " mitochondrial dna " which is shared by all maternally - related individuals and can be found even in the finest hair shafts			1
' @entity9 offers a way of linking people to places and items through the transfer of their pets ’ hairs			0
' fellow researcher @entity128 said : ' the police were lucky in this case , as most mitochondrial types are common when tested with the technique we used here			0
' we would like to use cutting - edge dna sequencing methods to identify further variation in cat mitochondrial dna to maximise the discriminating power of the evidence			0

@entity12 's body parts found wrapped in a curtain on a beach in @entity96
forensic scientists discovered the curtain had eight cat hairs on it
they then used @entity2 's first cat dna database to analyse hairs
it found the cat hairs belonged to @entity23 which was owned by @entity17
@entity17 was last month *jailed* for life for manslaughter
