by @entity0 published : 07:10 est , 29 august 2012 updated : 10:34 est , 30 august 2012 a couple have discovered they are sitting on a piece of history after uncovering a 33ft - deep medieval well under their sofa			2
but although @entity9 , 61 , is fascinated by the historic find , his wife @entity8 certainly is n’t and even made her husband wait more than two decades after it was first spotted to begin exploring it			1
the couple moved into their @entity16 home in @entity18 , @entity19 around 24 years ago , when they first noticed a slight indentation in the living room floor			1
enthusiastic @entity9 and his less - than - impressed wife @entity8 from @entity18 , @entity19 , who have uncovered an old well in the sitting room of their @entity16 home mr @entity9 , a former civil servant , said : ‘ i was replacing the joists in the floor when i noticed a slight depression - it appeared to be filled in with the foundations of the house			1
‘ i dug down about one foot and saw that it was a well but my wife just wanted to me to cover it back up because we had three children running around at the time			2
‘ i always wanted to dig it out to see if i could find a pot of gold at the bottom so when i retired at the end of last year that ’s what i did			2
’ with a helping hand from a local man mr @entity9 spent three days clearing the well , which is around 30 inches wide using a bucket on a rope to pull up the debris			1
plans of the site show that the well dates back to at least the 16th century , just after the end of the medieval period			2
and just five feet into the dig he made another discovery - an old sword			0
mr @entity9 spent three days clearing the well which is around 30 inches wide and up to 33ft deep since clearing the well , mr @entity9 has installed lighting and built a trap - door over it he said : ‘ it was hidden at a 45 degree angle and sort of just fell out			1
‘ it looks like an old peasant ’s fighting weapon because it appears to be made up of bits of metal all knocked together			0
’ having stopped digging at around 17ft mr @entity9 believes the well is at least 33ft deep			1
he has since put lighting in the well , tidied it up and built a trap - door into the living room floor for easy access			0
mr @entity9 said : ‘ i ’ve been doing lots of research into its history but i ’d like to try and find someone to date it			2
the couple moved into their @entity16 home in @entity18 24 years ago , when they first spotted the well ‘ i ’ve looked at old maps which showed @entity91 ’s leat and illustrated the area was just woodland until this house was built in 1895			1
‘ i love the well and think it ’s fascinating			0
i ’d love to find out who was here before us			0
‘ i ’ve got a piece of @entity18 ’s history in my front room			0
’ but mr @entity9 ’s wife @entity8 , a former housewife , does n’t share her husband ’s enthusiasm			1
she said : “ i hate the well			0
but i suppose it is quite a feature			0
‘ when we come to sell the house i just hope it ’s not a white elephant in the room			0

@entity9 first spotted the well 24 years ago but his wife @entity8 asked him wait to explore it
she says she ' hates ' well which her husband spent three days clearing out
