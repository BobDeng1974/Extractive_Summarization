@entity0 fought back off the ropes after fearing @entity2 was about to deliver the knockout blow to his @entity5 title bid			1
the four - time champion admitted any boxing referee would have stepped in to halt a similarly one - sided contest in the ring , after @entity2 powered to a 4 - 1 lead in their semi-final at the @entity13			1
at a venue which has staged top - class fights before , playing host to local hero @entity17 and a young @entity18 in the mid- 1990s , a ' greedy ' @entity0 resurrected his trophy mission with some spectacular counter-punching , finishing with breaks of 117 and 94 to win 6 - 5 and set up a final clash with @entity23 or @entity24			1
@entity0 admits he got lucky in his semi-final win over @entity2 at the @entity5 @entity0 came back from 4 - 1 down to secure a 6 - 5 victory and passage into the final @entity2 had won just two of 11 previous matches against @entity0 , but curiously both those victories came in the @entity5 , at @entity33 in 2010 and in their quarter - final last year in @entity13			1
the @entity36 battler began the latest contest by rifling in breaks of 66 , 49 , 73 and a 137 total clearance , but thereafter @entity0 's game was transformed			2
in went breaks of 62 , 68 , and 67 before the 39 - year - old @entity44 cueman saved the best for last			1
' if it was a boxing match they would definitely have stopped it and you 'd be talking to @entity2 as the winner , ' @entity0 said			1
' in the first five frames he gave me a good hiding and i could n't compete			0
if he 'd kept playing like that it was 6 - 1 all day long , and i was lucky to get a frame			1
' he outfoxed me , outpotted me and outscored me and looked so comfortable around the table			0
i got away with that one really			0
' @entity0 says he was ' outfoxed ' and ' outpotted ' by his opponent on saturday @entity2 will feel as though he has missed a major opportunity to progress through to the final despite skipping several minor tournaments , @entity0 has a happy habit of challenging for the big trophies , and has never lost a @entity63 @entity5 final , first winning the tournament as a 17 - year - old in 1993			1
he is looking to cap a hugely successful 2014 , in which he has landed titles at the masters , @entity69 , and @entity70 , as well as finishing runner - up to @entity72 at the @entity73			0
@entity0 's ongoing success in @entity13 comes despite the ankle break he sustained on the eve of the tournament			2
with six wins already , plus a 147 break which stands to earn him £ 44,000 , he is eyeing the £ 150,000 top prize on sunday			0
' if i play like i did in the last three or four frames , i 'll be all right			0
but what we 're talking about here is consistency			0
consistency is the key , ' @entity0 said			2
' i 'm being ultra critical here : i 'm in the final of the @entity5 and i won the last tournament			1
but i 've always been like that and it 's difficult to paint a rosy picture because i want more , i 'm greedy			0
' @entity2 let thoughts of reaching the biggest final of his career enter his head , and it cost him			2
asked what caused the turnaround , the 38 - year - old said : " i think it was when i thought about the final			1
i was thinking that it 's not every day you get the chance to get to the @entity63 final , and that was it			2
' i did n't get a chance in the last frame			0
he took the bull by the horns			0

@entity0 comes from 4 - 1 down to beat @entity2
39 - year - old admits he ' got lucky ' in his 6 - 5 win in the semi-finals
@entity0 has never lost in a @entity63 @entity5 final
