' an @entity28 used with the username ' dreday_4 ' reposted the image to his feed on monday with the caption ' when her prom ? '			1
@entity0 apparently found the picture funny since he commented ' @entity41 ' and reposted it on his own profile , adding ' lmfaooo ' to the caption			2
it appears both have since deleted the picture of @entity11 , a minor , from their profiles			1
but if @entity0 felt any shame in posting the controversial picture of the eldest first daughter , he did n't show it on tuesday when he started tweeting bright and early from inside court where he was serving on a jury			1

' damn i got jury duty today ! ! ! f * * * ! i 'm not the one for this , ' he wrote			1
@entity0 went on to express his distrust for the @entity67 justice department , writing the the system is flawed and because ' people who doing jury duty with me has already made there mind up on this guy ... so do i really matter ?
