rural : the girl , identified only as @entity9 , died in the tribal area of @entity11 in northwestern @entity2 , which borders @entity12 they say arrests would help put a stop to the practice of marrying very young girls to older men in the impoverished region			1
angry man , a blogger , posted that the man was ' an animal who deserved to be punished severely for his crime '			1
child bride : the practice of marrying young girls is widespread in @entity2 and has attracted the attention of international rights groups seeking to pressure the government to outlaw child marriages ' all those who supported such a crime should also be punished , ' he added			1
another blogger , called @entity40 , wrote : ' @entity9 â€™s family members are not humans			1
they do not deserve to have children			2
' despite numerous campaigns from many of the world 's largest charities and @entity50 , the issue of child brides remains a global concern			2
there are currently some 57.5 million child brides across the world , 40 per cent of which married in @entity56			2
forty - six per cent of women in @entity56 were married before the age of 18 , according to the @entity59			0
meanwhile , in @entity61 , 42 per cent of girls were married before turning 18 compared to 29 per cent in @entity62 and the @entity63			0

' the practice of marrying young girls is widespread in @entity2 and has attracted the attention of international rights groups seeking to pressure the government to outlaw child marriages			0
@entity2 's gripping poverty plays a role in hindering efforts to stamp out the practice , as poor families find themselves unable to say no to ' bride - prices ' that can be hundreds of dollars for their daughters			0
more than a quarter of @entity2 's females marry before age 15 , according to a report in 2010 by the @entity105			0
tribal custom also plays a role , including the belief that a young bride can be shaped into an obedient wife , bear more children and be kept away from temptation			2
in september 2010 , a 12 - year - old @entity2 child - bride died after struggling for three days in labour to give birth , a local human rights organisation said			2
