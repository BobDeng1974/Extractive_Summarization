@entity1 ' persistence with @entity2 as a lone striker has failed to pay off and the @entity5 manager has finally admitted it may be time for a change			1
in @entity10 's absence , which is likely to stretch from august 31 into the new year , the @entity8 international has managed just two goals in 13 appearances and has yet to hit the mark in the @entity14			1
there has been much criticism of the tactic of playing the 24 - year - old on his own in a front three as it is generally accepted he plays better in tandem with someone else			0
@entity24 ( centre ) might replace @entity2 ( right ) in the @entity5 starting team in coming weeks striker @entity10 has had yet another injury setback after picking up another thigh injury that was expected to be @entity10 at @entity30 on sunday , but a new thigh injury this week has ended hopes the pair could reinstate their partnership which was so effective in @entity2 's - and the team 's - best performance of the season in the 3 - 0 win at @entity39 in @entity10 's last game for the club			1
with that option now unavailable to @entity1 , he has hinted he may now need to tinker with his set - up			1
that could either mean good or bad news for the £ 16million summer signing from @entity47			0
@entity1 had confirmed @entity24 , another close - season arrival , will play a greater role in the coming weeks and he could opt to play the former @entity51 man , who has yet to open his account , in a two up front or even replace @entity2 outright			1
either way it suggests a change in tactics from the @entity59 boss , who also has @entity60 at his disposal			2
' you have to find the solutions when you are not winning games , ' said @entity1 , whose side have won just once in their last six matches in all competitions and taken only one point from their last three league matches			1
' you have to assess where you can be better and that is something i will always do			0
' i am not dogmatic			0
i have shown in my time here we have played in various systems : possession and fast football , counter-attacking football			2
@entity2 has only scored twice since signing for @entity5 from @entity47 and still has not scored a league goal @entity5 manager @entity1 has vowed to find ways to improve his team 's woeful form ' there are other possibilities for us and we will always explore that			1
' that was one of the reasons we brought in the likes of @entity24			1
he is a talented footballer but he gives you a different option of playing in a different way			0
' when he is in the team you have to ensure you get crosses into the box and get service for him , but it is the job of the manager to analyse that and pick what is the best structure in the game to get you a result			0
' shorn of the goals of @entity10 and summer departure @entity109 , @entity5 have not come remotely close to replicating the sort of form which saw them finish runners - up last season			1
the @entity2 conundrum has very much tested @entity1 , as has working out how to integrate the numerous summer signings he made with the proceeds of the £ 75million sale of @entity109 to @entity120 and get them up to speed			1
it is the beauty of the game at the leading edge , ' said the @entity125 , when asked whether it had been a tough challenge for him as manager			0
@entity5 have struggled to replace the goals scored by @entity109 , who left for @entity120 in the summer ' that week before the international break ( when they lost to @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135 ) was tough in terms of results			1
' of course when you are a club the size of @entity5 the spotlight you come under is huge			1
' but i ca n't complain			0
it is a wonderful life and the adverse moments always provide you with the opportunity to fight even harder , and that is what we all aim to do here			0
' the club is very much together			0
it has n't been a great start for us but we know we are only a short distance away from getting a few results which will push us back up , we are in the quarter - finals of a cup competition and the @entity156 is still in our own hands			2
' we just have to focus and really concentrate on moving on from a difficult period and looking to win games of football , which always changes the outcome			0
' in terms of looking to the future , @entity1 said a return to @entity30 would not hold any traumatic memories for them after their late collapse from 3 - 0 up to draw 3 - 3 last season , which put the final nail in their title dream			2
@entity1 ( centre ) takes his team to @entity30 on sunday , where they lost 3 - 0 lead to draw 3 - 3 last season ' for me it was n't the game that cost us , ' he said , referring to the home defeat by @entity135 the previous week which took the destiny out of their own hands			2
' it is a new season , we have a new motivation to go there and get a result			0
' it was a disappointment that night but we are very determined to kick - start our season			2

@entity1 admitted it is time for a change after poor @entity5 start
@entity24 set for a bigger role after mainly featuring as a substitute
@entity2 has not scored for @entity5 in the @entity14
