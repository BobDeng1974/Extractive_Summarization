by @entity0 published : 07:02 est , 15 january 2014 updated : 11:06 est , 15 january 2014 @entity2 has spoken for the first time since being found guilty of breaking the rules and insisted all his fellow professionals have welcomed him back to the fold			1
the @entity9 is competing in the @entity10 on thursday , his first outing since a three - man hearing adjudged he deliberately tapped down a spike mark in the @entity12 in @entity13 last october , and handed out a two month suspended sentence			1
‘ it has been great			2
i ca n’t say enough about my fellow pros			1
nobody has said anything and everyone has been coming up and talking to me , ’ said the @entity9			1
as if to prove the point , @entity20 wandered over soon afterwards and embraced @entity2			1
back in the swing : @entity2 returns to @entity24 action this week in @entity25 error : @entity2 was disqualified from the @entity12 for tapping down a spike mark on the line of his putt the 36 - year - old is competing here with a renewed love for the game after coming uncomfortably close to losing his livelihood for a period of time			1
in the end , the three - man hearing decided his dishonesty was a ‘ moment of aberration ’ rather than ‘ premeditated , ’ and opted for a heavy fine plus a ban of the suspended variety			1
' there was never any intent there whatsoever , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ i ’ve never done it in the past and i ’ll never do it in the future			2
there was no intent whatsoever to try to get an advantage			2
i ’m just going to be very careful from now on , make sure i ’m on the ball and be very professional about everything i do			2
' @entity2 resolved to put the matter behind him from the moment he walked out of the hearing early last month			1
‘ as soon as it was over it was over			2
that was the way i looked at it			2
my wife and i have not spoken about it , ’ he said			0
‘ what is in the past is in the past and i ca n’t do anything about it			0
i wish i could change what happened but nobody can , and so i just have to get on with it and carry on			0
’ show of support : @entity20 , pictured learning a traditional local dance in the @entity77 on tuesday , was spotted hugging @entity2 ahead of the controversial @entity9 's return to @entity24 action on course : the @entity82 practices on the par three fourth hole during the pro-am favourite : @entity20 , here teeing off on the 15th hole on wednesday , heads the betting ahead of the tournament perhaps the only good thing about the whole sorry saga that left his fellow pros incensed at the time is that it reminded @entity2 of the charmed life he leads playing professional golf for a living			1
‘ it ’s just nice to be back and doing something i love doing , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ there was a good chance it might have been taken away from me for a couple of months if the panel had seen it differently			0
now i ’m probably as focused as i have ever been			0
i will get my head down now and try to get back into the world ’s top 50			1
’ was it the lowest moment of his career ? ‘ i do n’t think you can get any worse , really , ’ he said			1
‘ it was n’t very nice			0
to be honest , i had n’t really been enjoying my golf for a couple of years , i had fallen out of love with it , and then to have it topped off by that was pretty low			0
but , like i said , it has made me realise i love what i am doing			0
’ @entity2 will begin on thursday morning in the company of fellow @entity9 @entity118 and @entity120 rookie , @entity121			1
look who 's in town : @entity124 begins his year on the course in the emirate this week hard yards : @entity128 practices at the pro-am on wednesday prior to the @entity130 the man to beat : @entity132 's no 1 @entity133 @entity133 was the first man to secure his place in @entity132 's @entity137 team and the @entity132 no 1 plans to be the first to arrive at @entity139 in september			1
@entity133 's brilliant form at the end of last season saw him make history by winning the @entity144 and race to @entity146 in the same year , not to mention gathering enough world ranking points to effectively qualify for the @entity137 with nine months to spare			0
the 27 - year - old , whose last appearance in the event came in 2008 , has accrued 240 points , almost 70 more than @entity128 needed in 2012 to secure the final qualifying berth on the world points list			0
but he has not played at @entity139 since 2004 , or seen the alterations made in recent years under the supervision of course designer @entity156 , and will therefore get there as soon as possible after playing in the @entity157 in @entity158 - assuming he qualifies for the event he won last year			0
' it 's been quite a few years since i played the @entity139 tournament , ' said @entity133 , who shot an opening round of 81 in 2002 as he went through the first of two major career slumps			1
' i 'm thinking about maybe making my way over a little bit early to get rid of some jet - lag and possibly get another round in before everybody else gets there			0
that 's a more likely scenario than making a trip there while i 'm in @entity120 because we 've got both the @entity176 and the @entity177 to look after in the summer			0
' @entity133 begins his 2014 campaign in the @entity130 this week , an event he has played every year since it started in 2006 but has yet to win			2
' i 've got two second places and it 's the one tournament down in this part of the world that i have n't won , ' the world no 3 added			0
' i managed to win in @entity146 in november ( at the @entity185 ) , the @entity186 in 2007 and @entity187 in 2006			0
' it would be a nice one to add to the collection here having made @entity146 my home for almost 10 years			0
it 's nice to be back and it 's going to be a challenge of course			2
' @entity197 , @entity198 @entity200 dreams : @entity133 has his sights set on another stellar year , culminating at @entity139			0
