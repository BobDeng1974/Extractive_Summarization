a huge chunk of the largest holiday camp ever constructed by the @entity2 has been sold for £ 2.2million			1
@entity3 of the @entity4 - built by @entity5 in the 1930s along the lines of @entity8 in the @entity9 - will be converted into a 400 - bed luxury hotel and 400 apartments			1
the building , the single - biggest sold in post-war @entity13 , had a reserve price of £ 700,000 , but telephone bidding at a @entity17 auction on saturday sent the price soaring			1
vast : a section of the @entity4 , which spans nearly three miles along the coast of the @entity22 island of @entity23 , has sold for £ 2.2million at an auction in @entity17 derelict : the camp was intended to provide entertainment for 20,000 @entity29 holidaymakers at any one time , but no - one ever stayed there and it fell into serious disrepair @entity32 was constructed on the @entity22 island of @entity23 by the stormtroopers of the @entity29 ' strength through @entity36 ' leisure organisation over a six - year period and occupies nearly three miles of beachfront			1
it was meant to provide holiday entertainment for 20,000 of @entity5 's hordes at any one time			2
but not a single @entity29 ever got to stay there			0
the last rooms of the ' @entity8 - of - the - dark - side ' were finished just as @entity45 began in 1939 and @entity32 was left empty , the greatest white elephant of all time			1
it was occupied after 1945 by the @entity48 and became a top - secret @entity50 base			0
white elephant : @entity52 of @entity32 was built in the same vein as @entity8 ( above ) in the @entity9 , but it did n't even get off the ground as the outbreak of @entity45 and subsequent defeat of @entity5 left it empty after @entity59 reunification , all the buildings were given listed status and a very few have been transformed into holiday flats			1
monitored enjoyment : @entity5 viewed leisure as yet another aspect of human activity to be governed by the @entity2 after the auction on saturday , it is hoped that investment in the remaining miles of accommodation will rise until all are given a makeover			0
initial fears that neo-nazis would buy into the blocks have proved unfounded			0
so far , there are a few luxury flats and a youth hostel in the buildings at the site 120 miles from @entity17			2
@entity80 is nearly 1,200ft long and auctioneer @entity82 juggled bids from least ten developers			0
nearly £ 5million has to date been raised for the government in sales of parts of the @entity32 complex			2
after the war , the @entity50 considered blowing it up , but discovered they did n't have enough dynamite for the job			0
instead they turned it into a massive tank - and - artillery base for the @entity95 of @entity13 and it vanished from all maps			0
a museum at the site chronicles the history of @entity32 which , aside from the building of the @entity102 of coastal fortifications stretching from @entity104 to the border of @entity106 - intended to thwart any @entity108 landings in occupied @entity109 - was @entity5 's biggest building project			1
the @entity2 viewed leisure as just one more aspect of human activity to be governed by the party			0
@entity32 was destined to be the forerunner of a string of such giant camps whose plans were mothballed due to the war he unleashed on the world .			2
