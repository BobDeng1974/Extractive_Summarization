experts blame eating and drinking to excess for the illness caused by a build - up in the blood of uric acid , a waste product formed by the breakdown of food , beer and wine			2
if someone produces too much uric acid , tiny crystals will start to form in the joints and cause pain and inflammation			0
' we believe that much of the rise in demand is down to over excesses of @entity19 and @entity56 , ' said @entity57 , superintendent pharmacist at @entity21			1
