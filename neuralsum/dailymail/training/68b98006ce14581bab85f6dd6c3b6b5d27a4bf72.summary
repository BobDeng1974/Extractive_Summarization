by @entity0 swooping low over sunbathing holiday makers , or flying high with the birds , this stunning collection of images captures both the drama and the serenity of aircraft in flight			1
although many of us boarding a plane without a second thought and see an airliner glide through the skies above us almost every day , the collection gives a unique glimpse into the aviation world			0
the dramatic photographs have been released by a specialist photography service and image library @entity20 to celebrate its 10th birthday			2
flying low : a @entity25 @entity24 757 flies over the heads of sunseekers at @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31			1

among some of the more exciting photographs in the collection are the flock of birds surrounding and @entity70 @entity24 , a @entity25 @entity24 757 coming into land seemingly just metres from a packed beach at @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity73 , and a mid air display by the famed @entity47			1
director @entity75 said : ' we are the largest supplier of aviation images in the world			2
' we have 200 photographers which i have handpicked and we have a portfolio of images that tell the whole history of aviation right back to the 1900s			0
take your breath away : a @entity89 takes off with the early morning sun in @entity91 , @entity73 dark skies : against the backdrop of dark rain clouds this @entity24 , as well as another departing aircraft stands out even more @entity96 bright : a @entity24 747 owned by @entity73 carrier @entity97 flies through a rainbow in the skies above @entity91 comings and goings : a @entity102 soars through the skies , while a flock of @entity106 planes come into land at @entity41 ' 10 years is a great milestone to get to - we took off with the @entity111 revolution and we have n't looked back			1
' mr @entity75 's love of aircraft began when he was a child , making his love for the job even stronger			1
he said : ' i have a real fascination with planes , which was probably kickstarted by me growing up next to @entity120			0
memories of the past : the @entity20 image library contains photographs documenting every aspect of the world of aviation , from the biggest super jumbos to this @entity129 flying in @entity130 red stripe : the extensive @entity20 library includes this @entity24 with its distinctive tail fin captured on camera at @entity41 breaking barriers : a @entity136 visibly breaks the sound barrier above @entity138 , @entity139 air stream : the emissions from this @entity89 seem to be glowing all the colours of the rainbow as the plane cruises through international airspace ' i would go with my friends and play football behind the fences which ran alongside the runways			2
' when photography came along it helped to keep the interest going , and here i am today			0
' @entity20 boasts more than 130,000 images within its online portfolio alone , and it comes as no surprise that manufacturing giant @entity24 is their biggest client			2
have a heart : cutting through a heart - shaped gap in the clouds seems particularly apt when you consider this 747 is taking off from @entity163 - the city of love up close : this image of a @entity24 business jet is one of more than 250,000 pictures in the @entity20 collection in control : a peek inside the cockpit of an @entity173 in @entity174 , @entity175 as the pilots bring the aircraft into land the library contain 's photographs documenting every aspect of the world of aviation - both civilian and military , taking in the very early days of aeroplane flight to the modern airliners and executive planes			1
' i never thought i would make a living out of planes , ' said mr @entity75			0
' it started out as a hobby and snowballed to the size it is now			0
' it 's quite a unique collection but it 's a one - stop shop for anything to do with aviation			0
' great and small : pictured together this larger @entity198 and the smaller @entity24 almost appear to be a family unit as they taxi in @entity91 into the mist : a @entity202 @entity24 cuts a swathe through the fog in @entity205 , @entity206			0
