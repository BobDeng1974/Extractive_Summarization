@entity1 and @entity2 cabinet ministers are today accused of plotting to persuade business leaders to undermine @entity5 ’s historic stand against a new @entity7 treaty			1
in an email leaked to the @entity11 , the heads of blue chip firms are asked to sign up to a letter demanding that the government ‘ re-engages ’ with @entity15			1
it is being circulated by leading @entity18 lobbyist @entity17 following a meeting with mr @entity1 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22			1
it says it is ‘ imperative ’ that @entity24 is not left on the ‘ outside ’ when important decisions are taken on the future of @entity28			1
the plotters ( clockwise from top left ) : @entity1 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 were all involved in a meeting earlier this week with a city lobbyist who later sent an email to business leaders telling them to back the @entity2 ' position on @entity28 the revelation prompted cries of treachery from @entity40 mps and raised fears that the issue of @entity28 could fracture the @entity43 – which is under the greatest strain since it was formed			1
mr @entity1 had initially backed the prime minister ’s use of the veto , but flip - flopped after a furious reaction from his own party			1
the attempt by mr @entity17 , a close friend of former @entity7 commissioner @entity51 , to influence @entity14 policy will raise further concerns about the power wielded by lobbyists			2
revelations about the influence of @entity59 ’s unofficial adviser @entity58 prompted the @entity61 ’s resignation			2
lobbyists at pr firm @entity63 , meanwhile , were secretly taped boasting of their access to the @entity65			2
summit : @entity17 chaired the meeting with the ministers earlier this week before later sending the email to business leaders last night there were fresh signs that the @entity7 agreement to create a new ‘ fiscal union ’ , which mr @entity5 refused to endorse at a crunch summit last week , is already crumbling			1
@entity76 and the @entity77 suggested they would not sign up unless plans to harmonise tax rates across the @entity81 are dropped			2
@entity82 , meanwhile , stepped up its attacks on @entity24 as the head of the @entity82 central bank insisted the @entity24 should be stripped of its gold - plated credit rating before his own country			2
mr @entity1 , who refused to attend mr @entity5 ’s @entity90 statement on the summit , has told @entity65 colleagues the government must now ‘ re-engage with our @entity28 partners ’			1
earlier this week , he attended a meeting chaired by mr @entity17 , chairman of @entity97 , and also attended by business secretary mr cable , treasury chief secretary mr @entity21 and energy secretary mr @entity22			1
in the leaked email , sent yesterday , mr @entity17 , founder of pr firm @entity98 , touts for signatures for a letter from business leaders backing the deputy prime minister ’s position			1
‘ having had an extremely productive meeting with @entity1 and three of his @entity65 colleagues @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 yesterday , we are convinced now more than ever that it is necessary for business leaders to maintain public pressure on the government to follow through on its promise to be fully engaged in the @entity7 following last week ’s veto , ’ it says			1
‘ we have been in touch with @entity116 , the @entity117 and the @entity118 , and they assure us that they would welcome this call			2
‘ we have drafted the following letter which we intend to run in the @entity123 next week			2
it seeks to make it crystal clear that we , as @entity24 business leaders , believe that it is vital that the @entity24 engages , focuses on the single market and supports the @entity7 ’s institutions in helping the euro			1
‘ you will see that the letter is totally constructive and non-party political , as it must be in order to be most effective			0
it would be enormously helpful if you were able to add your name to it			0
’ the draft text of the letter says that the @entity7 ’s single market is of ‘ great importance ’ to the @entity24 and accounts for more than half of the country ’s trade			0
‘ but we must deepen and widen it , and push for reform in services , the digital arena and energy , ’ it goes on			0
undermined ? the meeting involving mr @entity1 and his colleagues came following @entity5 's decision to veto a new @entity7 agreement ‘ to do this we need to remain at the core of @entity28 , fighting for @entity24 interests with our partners who share our desire for an open and liberal @entity28			1
whilst recognising that it is not desirable for the @entity24 to join the euro , it is overwhelmingly in our interests that the currency survives , and we need to help where we can			0
' the prime minister said in the @entity164 that the @entity24 is “ supportive of the role of the [ @entity28 ] institutions			1
” that is an important starting point as we seek to find a formula that will place us firmly amongst the 27 members of the @entity7 as we ensure that we continue to develop the single market			0
‘ it is imperative that we are not outside when important decisions are taken , and as opportunities arise over the coming months for @entity24 to re-engage in the decision making process in @entity28 , we must seize them			1
’ @entity2 sources said it was no secret that mr @entity1 had been talking to business people about the issue of @entity28 and said the entire @entity43 had agreed that @entity24 should ‘ re-engage ’ with the @entity7 following last week ’s veto			1
asked about mr @entity17 ’s claim that he had been in touch with @entity186 , the @entity117 and the @entity118 to discuss the initiative , a @entity14 spokesman said he was unaware of it			1
@entity40 mp @entity189 , who resigned as a @entity191 aide earlier this year after backing an @entity7 referendum , insisted mr @entity1 should ‘ disown ’ mr @entity17 ’s initiative			0
‘ the public are not in the mood for @entity1 to be plotting with @entity197 , ’ he said			0
‘ mr @entity17 ’s opinions are somewhat undermined by the fact that he has been consistently wrong on the @entity7 for years , particularly on the merits or otherwise of the single currency			0
’ a recent @entity203 poll for the @entity204 think tank found that 69 per cent of managers at @entity24 finance firms support a @entity24 veto on @entity7 financial rules even if it reduces access to the single @entity212 survey of 500 bosses found that 56 per cent think that , on balance , the costs of @entity7 financial regulation currently outweigh the benefits of the single market to the @entity18 , while 31 per cent disagree			0
many of @entity24 ’s top businessmen applaud @entity5 ’s boldness at last week ’s euro @entity223 chairman @entity222 , who heads one of the @entity24 ’s biggest exporters , said that @entity5 ’s refusal to sign up to a new @entity28 fiscal accord was : ‘ a brave thing to do and the right thing to do ’			1
@entity230 , @entity40 peer and chairman of high street retailer , @entity233 , said : ‘ the prime minister was absolutely right			0
there is no point in having a veto if you ’re never prepared to use it			0
the reassurances the prime minister wanted were to protect one of @entity24 ’s most valuable industries and were entirely reasonable			0
’ last night a spokesman for mr @entity1 said : ‘ i do n’t see how liaising with business and asking them to say what they want to see in terms of @entity24 ’s relationship with @entity28 is doing anything other than taking forward the government ’s attempt to re-engage constructively with our @entity7 partners			1
mr @entity17 denied that the letter was ‘ a @entity2 thing ’ and said his meeting with the four most senior members of the party was in his diary for months			1
he said : ‘ we had a breakfast which was a longstanding arrangement			0
we ’ve had people from all political parties to our meetings			0
we happened to have a meeting that i grant you turned out to be interesting timing			2
’ mr @entity17 also denied that the letter was pushing a @entity2 agenda			0
he added : ‘ the letter says clearly that this is about support for the single market , which is absolutely key to most businesses because half our trade is with the @entity7			0
it quotes the prime minister in the @entity164 about the possibility of using the @entity7 institutions			0
we want to be at the core of the engine and seize opportunities to get back in there			2
‘ on that basis it is not a @entity2 thing			0
it ’s something that businesses think			0
’ he said @entity297 , a director of @entity298 , had ‘ spoken to a lot of people ’ about the letter , but admitted : ‘ i do n’t know if he ’s had conversations with conservative cabinet ministers – i suspect not – but a lot of people would have been aware of it			2
