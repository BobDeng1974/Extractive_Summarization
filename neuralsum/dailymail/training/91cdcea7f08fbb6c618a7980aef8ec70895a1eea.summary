@entity9 , of @entity10 , was being held without bail after he was charged wednesday with the murder of 58 - year - old @entity13			1
@entity9 was going more than 80 mph in a 40 mph zone when he hit @entity16 and her husband along a busy boulevard in @entity20 on june 9 , prosecutors allege			1
@entity16 's husband only broke an arm , but she was killed			0
' @entity24 ' : @entity9 used @entity7 to brag about how fast he drove before fatally hitting a woman on a bicycle fateful tweet : one of @entity9 's tweets boasting about his driving @entity9 reportedly stopped at the scene and was cooperative with police			1
an analysis of @entity9 's driving record , along with @entity7 posts in which he discussed how fast he liked to drive , persuaded prosecutors to change the charge to murder , the @entity34 district attorney 's office said			1
a @entity7 account apparently belonging to @entity9 is now restricted from public view , but local media outlets have posted screen grabs of an account that apparently belongs to @entity9 , where he asks his @entity7 followers if they want to go for a ' death ride ' with him			1
in other posts , he wrote things like ' drive fast live young , ' and posted photos of his speedometer clocking high speeds			0
@entity55 , a supervisor of the homicide unit at the @entity58 district attorney 's office who is not involved in this case , told the @entity60 that in most circumstances , fatal crashes result in murder charges when the suspect was recklessly fleeing police or was a drunken driver with previous convictions , not because of something like a @entity7 feed			2
@entity55 said in this case it is likely the tweets will serve as what 's called a ' pre-offense statement , ' often an email , handwritten note or text message , used to bolster prosecutors ' attempt to prove malice			2
' the challenge in these situations is proving that your defendant is the person who posted the statement , " he said			0

another commenter with the handle ' ken mo ' wrote that ' as reckless and inexcusable as this young man 's actions were , please keep in mind he did not go out on the road that day planning to kill someone , it was a complete accident			0
his actions have horrific consequences and he will have to pay			0
but to all of you who continue to denounce him i do n't think you realize this could have easily been your own kid			0
it was a stupid teenage mistake that so many high schoolers make , many just luck out and never hurt anyone			0
