@entity1 scientists have revealed how they reconstructed the face of one of @entity5 ’s elite archers who drowned when the @entity6 sank in 1545			1
the team from @entity8 worked with a @entity10 expert , @entity9 , to reconstruct the face of the man			1
they used 3d scanning and printing - as well as modern forensic techniques - to analyse several skulls recovered from the @entity6 and make a replica of one			2
a team from @entity8 has used @entity14 and printing to recreate the face of a man who drowned when the @entity6 sank in 1545 mr @entity9 then took over the reconstruction and built up the man ’s face muscle by muscle			1
from studying the face and skeleton , the team have established a number of things about the man			1
they believe that he was an archer because his skeleton shows evidence of repetitive stress injuries from pulling a longbow			1
they also believe that he was of high rank because he was found with an ivory armguard , a silver ring and a bag containing a pewter plate			1
he was more than six feet tall and was in his 20s or 30s			1
the work is part of a wider project involving @entity8 and the @entity49			0
they started by studying the skulls that had been taken from the wreckage of the @entity6 and deciding which one to reconstruct they then scanned and analysed the skull before using 3d printing technology to create an exact replica of it			1
the reconstruction was then built up muscle by muscle the researchers believe that the man ( whose skull is shown as a 3d scan ) was an archer who was six feet tall and in his 20s or 30s			1
they also think he was of high rank because he was found with valuable objects when the warship was raised from the @entity71 in 1982 , 92 fairly complete skeletons of the crew were recovered			1
ten skulls were taken to @entity8 for analysis , including the skull of the man whose face has been reconstructed			1
@entity77 , a sport and exercise biomechanist at the @entity80 , which has led the @entity8 work on the project , said : ‘ archers were the only professional soldiers of their day			0
so it is very likely that this is the face of one of @entity5 ’s elite troops			2
‘ what ’s so exciting is that we can reveal the face of a man who has been hidden from history			2
we would n’t have portraits of him , as we do for wealthy and powerful people from the past – for example we ’d already seen the face of @entity99 on paintings before his remains were discovered			2
‘ this is a face of an ordinary man , albeit in a crack regiment , and he has n’t been seen for almost 500 years			2
the researchers scanned the original skull using a @entity14 laser scanner - this gave an exact three - dimensional virtual replica			1
they then ' printed ' an exact copy of the skull ( pictured ) , using a 3d printer ‘ thanks to 21st century technology and expertise , we can bring him vividly back to life , and understand more about his world			2
’ mr @entity77 explained the steps involved in producing the reconstruction : ‘ the key objective was to produce a replica of the skull , but without damaging it			2
‘ first we scanned the original skull using a @entity14 laser scanner			1
this gave us an exact three - dimensional virtual replica of the skull			1
‘ the computer image was then given to @entity8 ’s astute group to “ print ” an exact copy of the skull , using a 3d printer			2
the group normally use this type of technology to develop rapid prototypes of new products for companies			0
printing took 48 hours altogether			2
‘ we then gave the 3d copy of the skull to @entity9 , an expert in facial reconstruction			0
using his expertise in forensics , his knowledge of anatomy and tissue depth , and his artistic abilities , he was able to build up the face muscle by muscle			1
’ the reconstructed face , along with many other artefacts from the @entity6 , is on display in the new @entity158 in @entity159			0
when the warship was raised from the @entity71 in 1982 , 92 fairly complete skeletons of crew members were recovered			0
the team also studied these bones for clues about the ship 's crew the reconstructed face , along with many other artefacts from the @entity6 , is on display in the new @entity158 in @entity159 the team also studied a longbow recovered from the ship - it is believed that this is the sort of weapon used by the reconstructed archer the 16th - century warship @entity6 has been undergoing a meticulous programme of conservation since it was lifted from the seabed more than 30 years ago			1
ever since the hull of @entity5 's flagship was raised in october 1982 , it has been constantly sprayed with millions of litres of water and wax chemicals to preserve it			0
at first , the hull was sprayed with recycled , fresh water at a temperature of less than @entity190 ( @entity189 ) to stop the wood drying out and to inhibit bacterial activity			0
the hull had been preserved under the sea as it had been embedded in mud preventing bacteria and tides from eroding it			0
an artist 's depiction of the sinking of the @entity201 in 1985 , the ship was turned upright and titanium props were installed to support the internal structure and work was undertaken to remove as much sediment as possible			0
from 1994 , active conservation commenced with the spraying of @entity209 ( @entity209 ) , a water - soluble polymer which can penetrate deep into the wood and support the cell walls			0
and just last month , on april 29 , the @entity213 were turned off and the hull will begin its final air - drying phase to remove 100 tonnes of water during the next four to five years			0
visitors to the new museum will be able to view the hull through windows into the airtight chamber as it undergoes this final stage of conservation			0
the @entity158 has worked closely with the team behind the @entity10 warship @entity224 which has used a similar highly - sophisticated drying process			0
once drying is complete in 2017 , the internal walls surrounding the hull will be removed and visitors will be able to see a completely unobstructed view of the hull			0
@entity231 , head of conservation at the @entity49 , said : ' the conservation of @entity5 's warship @entity6 has been one of the largest and most complex programmes of this type ever undertaken			0
' it really will be a unique chance for visitors to see our dedicated team preserve such a treasured artefact as they can see through windows into the ' hotbox ' containing the @entity6 when the new museum opens			0

used @entity14 and printing to create an exact replica of the man 's skull
then built up the face muscle by muscle until it *resembled* a living man
studying the face and skeleton revealed he was an archer because he had repetitive stress injuries which were probably caused by pulling a longbow
also showed he was six feet tall , in his 20s or 30s , and of high rank
