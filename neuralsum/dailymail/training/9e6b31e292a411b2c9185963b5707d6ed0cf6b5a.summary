a 900 - year - old norse code has finally been cracked , and experts believe it ’s the @entity3 equivalent of a @entity5 ’s day card			2
the message , which is thought to say in part ‘ kiss me ’ , means scientists may have stumbled upon a nearly millennium - old love letter			0
it came after phd student @entity13 unravelled the mysterious @entity15 code , which dates back to as early as the 9th century			1
the ' kiss me ' carving , thought to have been made in the 12th or 13th century , was written in cipher runes , the most common code known from medieval @entity18 the ‘ kiss me ’ carving , thought to have been made in the 12th or 13th century in @entity20 , @entity21 , was written in cipher runes , the most common code known from medieval @entity18			1
‘ the problem with this code system is that it is impossible to read because the code gives many possible solutions , ’ mr @entity22 told @entity23			2
mr @entity29 , from the @entity30 , is the first person to study all the findings of runic codes in @entity33 , totalling around 80 inscriptions			1
‘ in the cases i have been able to read , the text they contain personal names			0
’ mr @entity29 , from the @entity30 , is the first person to study all the findings of runic codes in @entity33 , totalling around 80 inscriptions			1
one such inscription is pictured here			0
the carvings are thought to say that it was written by ' the most knowledgeable man west of the sea ' to read the jötunvillur code , you would replace the original runic character with the last sound of the rune name			2
for example , the rune for f , pronounced fe , would be turned into an e , while the rune for k , pronounced kaun , became n. while this sounds straightforward jötunvillur code is written in a way that makes the interpretation ambiguous			0
mr @entity61 added that jötunvillur can only be written and not read , which would make it pointless for use in a message			0
‘ it is , however , possible - with some uncertainty - to interpret the runic inscription on a piece of bone found in @entity20 as " kiss me " ’			2
mr @entity61 bases his interpretation on his work on the jötunvillur code , but is keen to highlight that there are differences to the two codes that could mean the message is something different althought			2
‘ for the jötunvillur code , one would replace the original runic character with the last sound of the rune name , ’ he explained in an interview with @entity82			0
‘ for example , the rune for “ f ” , pronounced “ fe , ” would be turned into an “ e , ” while the rune for “ k , ” pronounced “ kaun , ” became “ n. ” ’ @entity93 previously thought the code was used to communicate secret messages , but mr @entity29 thinks the pattern might have been vital in the teaching of rune instead			1
the carving was discovered in @entity20 , @entity21			1
@entity93 previously thought the code was used to communicate secret messages , but mr @entity29 thinks the pattern might have been vital in the teaching one of the reasons for his claim is that the jötunvillur code is written in a way that makes the interpretation ambiguous			1
mr @entity61 says that jötunvillur can only be written and not read , which would make it pointless for use in a message			0
instead , mr @entity29 thinks the @entity114 memorised rune names with the help of the jötunvillur code			1
the ‘ kiss me ’ carving suggests that the code may also have been used as a type of puzzle for others to interpret			0
‘ people challenged one another with codes			0
it was a kind of competition in the art of rune making			0
this testifies to a playfulness with writing that we do n’t see today , ’ said mr @entity29 .			1

@entity133 thought to have been made in the 12th century in @entity20 , @entity21
find came after @entity30 student unravelled *related* @entity15 code
@entity93 previously thought code was used to communicate secrets
mr @entity29 thinks the pattern might have been vital in education instead
