@entity0 must shoulder some of the blame for @entity3 's defection , after falling out with him over the issue of @entity5 during the run - up to last week ’s @entity9 conference , @entity6 was spotted going into an elegant @entity11 townhouse close to a former site of the @entity14 hospital , one of the first @entity17 mental institutions , where the gentry used to amuse themselves by laughing at the inmates			1
@entity3 , a bespectacled 6ft 3in economist and barrister who became a @entity22 mp at the last election , arrived around the same time			2
it was in the privacy of the £ 2 million house that they plotted their own modern - day public spectacle : the humiliation of @entity0 on the eve of the @entity32 conference			2
the house is owned by @entity33 , who has a 12,000 - acre estate in the west of @entity35 , who was elevated to the @entity37 in 1990 by @entity38 shortly before she was bundled unceremoniously from office			1
as lord @entity33 he was always on the eurosceptic wing of the @entity32			2
it was his membership of the @entity43 select committee , from 1992 to 1996 , which led him to become a leading exponent of the case for the @entity17 to leave the @entity43			0
in 2004 , in despair at the @entity22 stance on @entity5 , he recommended people voted @entity9 in the @entity5 elections , and was swiftly punished by having the @entity22 whip removed			1
he joined @entity9 three years later			2
he made good use of his time on the @entity9 side , becoming firm friends with @entity56 , the mp for @entity57 , and the first @entity22 mp in the current @entity59 to defect to @entity9			1
@entity56 is a close friend of @entity60			1
they often met for drinks at @entity33 ’s home as they toyed with the idea of joining @entity9			1
but while @entity56 , an mp since 2005 , is a popular figure on the @entity22 benches , the same is not true of @entity60 , who is regarded as cold and aloof			1
@entity56 is one of his few confidantes at @entity70			2
with the @entity57 by - election looming on october 9 , dozens of @entity22 mps have discovered pressing alternative engagements when asked to go to the @entity75 seaside town to campaign against @entity56			1
but there is real anger among @entity71 about @entity60 , not least because he was lying about his intentions only hours before his bombshell announcement			2
so why did @entity60 decide to jump ? the truth is @entity0 has much to answer for			2
his sometimes casual attitude to party management has repeatedly alienated some mps			0
if any of them criticise him privately or publicly , they can find themselves sent to the political equivalent of @entity87			0
in the run - up to last week 's @entity9 conference , @entity6 and @entity3 were spotted going into a £ 2million townhouse in @entity91 together in the summer of 2013 , @entity0 led an away - day of @entity22 @entity71 in his @entity94 constituency in @entity95			1
it was designed to foster team spirit and develop election - winning policies			0
unfortunately , by the end of the gathering , the prime minister ’s already fractious relationship with @entity3 had disintegrated			0
in a speech during that event , the @entity99 stressed the importance of unity			0
@entity107 , the former gp who became mp for @entity110 at the last election , interrupted to say her constituents admired her independent - minded stances on several issues			0
after the session ended , @entity0 sought out @entity107 and said : ‘ well , @entity107 , you have to understand that when you rebel you never change anything			0
you just make us look divided			0
’ reckless , who was sitting next to @entity107 , intervened , reminding the @entity99 the only reason @entity0 cut @entity17 ’s @entity43 grant was because of a revolt in 2012 by @entity22 mps			2
the pm snapped back , saying : ‘ i would have cut that anyhow			0
’ a disagreement ensued , and @entity60 ’s draining ‘ faith ’ in the pm evaporated			2
in june this year , @entity60 – who studied @entity129 at @entity130 and was privately educated at @entity131 – was the first mp to be called to speak at a meeting of the 1922 backbench committee of mps which was addressed by @entity0			2
he challenged the prime minister over his promised renegotiation of powers from the @entity43 ahead of a referendum in 2017 if the @entity22 win the @entity141			2
@entity0 is said to have been dismissive of @entity60 , who concluded that the promised renegotiation was a pr stunt			0
the @entity9 timebomb which had started ticking away the previous year was by then on a very short fuse			0
the first approach from @entity9 to @entity60 – a former economist who married @entity35 solicitor @entity149 at @entity150 in 2011 – came from @entity151 , the spread - betting magnate who gave £ 5 million to the @entity22 in 2001 when they were committed to keeping the pound			1
lord @entity33 was a former @entity22 mp , but defected to @entity9 in 2007			1
he also led the party for a short time @entity151 was thrown out of the @entity22 in 2009 when he gave £ 100,000 to @entity9 , which he subsequently joined			1
he entertained @entity60 twice at @entity156 – an @entity158 restaurant a short walk from @entity151 ’s home			0
it was after the @entity151 lunches that @entity60 got to know @entity6 much better			1
but the decisive factor in the defection of @entity60 was @entity33			1
the founder of a @entity91 - based insurance brokers , which he sold for millions in the 1990s , @entity33 owns a moor , a deer forest , and a £ 4 million 12,000 - acre country estate in @entity170 in the @entity171			0
he has a share portfolio worth a reputed £ 2.5 million			0
with his cut - glass accent , a legacy of his @entity175 education , @entity33 , 72 , looks and sounds like an archetypal @entity22 grandee			1
he became the leader of @entity9 after @entity6 stood down to fight a parliamentary seat at the 2010 election			1
one of his first acts was to withdraw candidates in elections against four prominent @entity184			0
he forced the policy through in the teeth of bitter opposition from within @entity9 ’s ranks			0
the candidates were @entity190 , who was defending @entity191 , which he won last time with a 10,000 majority , and @entity194 in @entity195 , which he held with a 9,000 majority			0
and the other two candidates ? step forward @entity56 and @entity3			0
@entity33 also flooded their constituencies with 50,000 @entity9 leaflets , urging votes to support the @entity22 candidates			1
all four enjoyed greater swings in their favour than in other constituencies			0
given that two of the four @entity22 he backed at the last election have since defected , @entity33 admits : ‘ i always thought it was the right thing to do			1
’ and what about the other two , @entity190 and @entity194 ? ‘ i do n’t know anything about that , ’ he says			0
which is exactly what he said about @entity56 and @entity60			1
how the @entity22 must regret the offer from @entity6 and @entity33 to stand down every one of their candidates at the last general election if mr @entity0 would make an unequivocal declaration in favour of an @entity43 referendum			1
@entity33 made the offer in june 2009 to @entity222 , the then @entity22 leader in the @entity37 , who conveyed it to @entity0			1
the @entity22 leader rejected it out of hand			0
given the events of the weekend , no wonder @entity22 mps and strategists are terrified another @entity9 defector is about to lob a political hand grenade into the conservative conference hall .			1

@entity6 met @entity60 before @entity9 conference in house of @entity33
a former @entity22 , @entity33 defected to @entity9 himself in 2007 over @entity5
@entity33 is also good friends with @entity56 , the first @entity22 defector
