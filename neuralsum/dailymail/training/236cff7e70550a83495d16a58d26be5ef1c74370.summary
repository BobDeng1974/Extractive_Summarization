canned : the @entity0 faces further questions over why a 10 - minute @entity3 film looking into allegations of child sex abuse by @entity6 was dropped last december the @entity0 today faced further questions over why a ten - minute @entity3 film looking into allegations of child sex abuse by @entity6 was dropped by the programme 's editor last december			1
the item was spiked - despite journalists interviewing ten alleged victims and witnesses , and believing they had enough information to broadcast the story			1
the corporation insisted that it decided not to proceed with the @entity3 film for ' editorial reasons ' because the abuse story ' could not be substantiated '			1
but the programme was due to go out a couple of weeks before the airing by the @entity0 of @entity25 tributes to the presenter			1
sources within the @entity0 's newsroom said they feared that the corporation was embarrassed about the timing of the report , according to the @entity32			1
it came as veteran radio dj @entity34 lifted the lid on how the @entity36 'll fix it star used his power in the @entity0 to dodge sex abuse claims			1
mr @entity34 , 63 , said said the world of showbiz had been aware of the claims of abuse by the flamboyant celebrity for decades before victims finally told their story this week			1
@entity48 will broadcast a documentary tonight , featuring claims from five women that they were sexually abused by @entity6 when they were girls			1
it builds on the unreleased @entity3 film and is based on an investigation conducted by former detective @entity55 , who acted as an adviser to the @entity0 team			1
@entity3 's work began almost immediately after @entity6 's death at the age of 84			2
a month later , the @entity0 team had persuaded one victim to be filmed on the record - while the others were only prepared to give evidence anonymously or under pseudonyms			2
the @entity3 reporters involved were confident enough in their material to put together a script for a ten - to 12 - minute package , indicating they believed their film was largely complete , @entity32 reported			1
a source told the paper that initially editor @entity73 was understood to be ready to air it			1
however , the mood changed soon afterwards			0
it is understood that the reporters were asked to meet two preconditions set by @entity73			1
cover - up ? @entity3 , presented by @entity80 ( above ) , spiked the film despite journalists interviewing 10 alleged victims and witnesses and believing they had enough information to broadcast the story first , they had to demonstrate that there had been a police investigation into @entity90			1
@entity3 was able to confirm privately that he had been interviewed under caution in 2007 - a fact not stated in public until monday			1
at this point , a second condition was introduced			0
@entity3 had learned that the @entity97 had concluded that it was not in the public interest to charge @entity6 , and the @entity3 team was asked to find out why			0
some of those interviewed by the @entity0 said they believed @entity6 was not charged because by then he was too old			1
the production team were asked to confirm this with the @entity97 , but the prosecutors would only say they did not proceed against @entity6 for lack of evidence			0
it is understood that when this information was relayed to @entity108 , it was used as the justification for quashing the film			2
on the defence : @entity3 editor @entity73 ( above ) said the current affairs show dropped the story because it ' had not established any institutional failure ' on behalf of the police or @entity97 it is understood that @entity118 , the director of @entity119 , was made aware of the @entity3 investigation as part of routine editorial procedures			1
but insiders said she did not take the final decision on whether the programme should be broadcast			2
a @entity127 mp on the @entity128 said the @entity0 had to look into the circumstances in which the @entity3 film was pulled , as well as claims that @entity6 's alleged abuse of young girls was known about at the corporation decades ago			1
@entity135 , who is himself a former journalist , said : ' given the seriousness of the allegations , it is incumbent on the @entity0 to investigate what it knew , and when			0
' that investigation should also include a full look at the circumstances in which this programme was withdrawn			2
what the @entity0 needs to specify in particular is what it means by ‘ editorial reasons ’ , which can cover a multitude of circumstances			0
' asked why nothing was done , former @entity0 journalist and founder of the @entity152 child - protection charity @entity153 told @entity154 : ' maybe it was just the fact that @entity6 knew everybody			0
' we made him into the @entity6 who was untouchable , who nobody could criticise			0
' mr @entity73 said the current affairs show dropped the story because it ' had not established any institutional failure ' on behalf of the police or @entity97			1
writing on a @entity0 blog , mr @entity73 said it was ' totally untrue ' he had come under any pressure to drop the story from within the corporation			1
he said : ' i decided we should pursue the story because of the nature of the allegations and because the key witness told us the police had investigated the claims			2
but the case had been dropped on the grounds he was too old			0
' this made the public interest case from a @entity3 point of view potentially strong			0
if we could establish some sort of institutional failure we would have a much stronger story			0
' he added the @entity97 told @entity3 no action was taken against the star because of ' lack of evidence ' and ' it would not be correct to say that his age and frailty was the reason '			2
mr @entity73 said : ' i felt it was significant the guidance was included and we had not established any institutional failure , and i judged it weakened the story from a @entity3 perspective			1
i took the decision not to publish			0
' influential : sir @entity6 ( left ) used his power and influence at the @entity0 to keep the lid on sex abuse claims , according to veteran radio dj @entity34 ( right ) ' @entity6 knew everybody ' : @entity152 founder @entity153 ( left ) said @entity6 had become ' untouchable ' to the point where nobody could criticise him @entity210 mp @entity209 , who is also on the culture select committee , said the key issue was whether someone at the @entity0 had made a complaint : ' that would be a game changer			2
' meanwhile , the @entity0 has said it will make direct contact with police to provide full support over the ' disturbing allegations ' involving @entity6			0
it comes as a historic rape allegation made against the entertainer was referred to @entity224 by officers in @entity226			0
a spokesman for the @entity0 said : ' a number of serious and disturbing allegations have been made over the past few days about the sexual abuse of teenage girls by @entity6			0
' some of these allegations relate to activity on @entity0 premises in the 1960s and 70s			0
we are horrified by allegations that anything of this sort could have happened at the @entity0 - or have been carried out by anyone working for the @entity0			0
' they are allegations of a serious criminal nature which the police have the proper powers to investigate			0
' so we have today asked the @entity0 investigations unit to make direct contact with all the police forces in receipt of allegations and offer to help them investigate these matters and provide full support to any lines of inquiry they wish to pursue			0
' ' horrified ' : the @entity0 has said it will make direct contact with police to provide full support over the sex abuse allegations involving the @entity36 'll fix it star the investigations unit is a division of the @entity0 responsible for security and safety matters within the corporation			1
it was also revealed yesterday that @entity267 and @entity226 police both investigated accusations made against the entertainer about alleged abuse in two children ’s homes , but decided there was not enough evidence to proceed			2
a spokeswoman for @entity267 police said : ' during the course of the @entity280 ’s historic abuse investigation , a verbal allegation of indecent assault said to have occurred during the 1970s at the former children ’s home @entity283 was received			0
' the allegation was investigated but there was insufficient evidence to proceed			0
' in 2007 , @entity287 received an allegation of indecent assault that was alleged to have taken place at a children ’s home in @entity292 during the 1970s			2
the force said : ' the allegation was investigated and an individual was interviewed under caution			2
' the matter was referred to the @entity97 for a charging decision who advised there was insufficient evidence to take any further action			0
