by @entity0 published : 10:31 est , 14 november 2013 updated : 10:32 est , 14 november 2013 @entity2 mobility for young adults has fallen to the lowest level in more than 50 years as cash - strapped 20 - somethings shun home - buying and refrain from major moves in a weak job market			1
the new 2013 figures from the @entity10 , which reversed earlier signs of recovery , underscore the impact of the sluggish economy on young people , many of them college graduates , whom demographers sometimes refer to as ' @entity18 '			1
burdened with college debt or toiling in low - wage jobs , they are delaying careers , marriage and having children			2
@entity24 works as associate director at the @entity27 office - he stayed in his college town while trying to unsuccessfully find a job in his field of study waiting anxiously for their lucky break , they are staying put and doubling up with roommates or living with parents , unable to make long - term plans or commit to buying a home - let alone pay a mortgage			2
many understood after the 2007 - 2009 recession that times would be tough			2
but few say they expected to be in economic limbo more than four years later			0
' i 'm constantly looking for other jobs , ' says @entity24 , 27 , of @entity47 , @entity48 , who graduated from @entity50 in may 2011 with a master 's degree in human and organizational development			0
originally from @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity54 has stayed put in his college town in hopes of finding a job in management consulting or human resources			0
instead , he has mostly found odd jobs like pulling weeds and dog - sitting			2
@entity54 says he pursued a master 's degree to bolster his credentials after getting his college diploma in 2008 , shortly before the financial meltdown			0
chart shows mobility rate of young adults aged 25 - 29 instead , he finds himself still struggling financially and worrying that the skills he learned in school - where he incurred $ 20,000 in student loan debt - are ' kind of atrophying right now			1
' ' it 's not like riding a bicycle			0
you ca n't just jump into a career position so many years after training , ' said @entity54 , who now works at a nonprofit organization making $ 12 an hour and is looking for a second job			2
among adults ages 25 - 29 , just 4.9 million , or 23.3 per cent , moved in the 12 months ending march 2013			1
that 's down from 24.6 per cent in the same period the year before			0
it was the lowest level since at least 1963			0
the peak of 36.7 percent came in 1965 , during the nation 's youth counterculture movement			0
the past year 's decline in migration came after a modest increase from 2011 to 2012 , a sign that young adults remain tentative about testing the job market in other cities			1
by metropolitan area , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 , and @entity99 were among the top gainers in young adults , reflecting stronger local economies			1
@entity24 is one example of millions who pursued a master 's degree shortly before the financial meltdown - leaving him struggling to use the skills he paid for among college graduates 25 and older , @entity109 and @entity110 , topped the list of destinations			1
demographers say the delays in traditional markers of adulthood - full - time careers and homeownership - may prove to be longer - lasting			1
roughly 1 in 5 young adults ages 25 to 34 is now disconnected from work and school			1
' young adulthood has grown much more complex and protracted , with a huge number struggling to reach financial independence , ' said @entity125 , an associate vice president at the private @entity126			2
' many will get there , but at much later ages than we 've seen in the past			0
more and more we 're seeing many young adults routinely wait until their 30s to leave the parental nest			1
' the overall decline in migration among young adults is being driven largely by a drop in local moves within a county , which fell to the lowest level on record			1
out - of - state moves also fell , from 3.8 pe rcent in 2012 to 3.4 percent , but remained higher than a 2010 low of 3.2 percent			1
young adults typically make long - distance moves to seek a new career , while those who make local moves often do so when buying a home			1
while homeownership across all age groups fell by 3 percentage points to 65 per cent from 2007 to 2012 , the drop - off among adults 25 - 29 was much larger — more than 6 percentage points , from 40.6 percent to 34.3 per cent			1
@entity24 says : ' it 's not like riding a bicycle			0
you ca n't just jump into a career position so many years after training ' that reflects in part tighter lines of credit after the 2006 housing bust			0
declines in homeownership for those ages 40 and older over in that five - year period were more modest			1
the @entity110 , with its high share of young adults , had the lowest homeownership rate across all age groups at 41.6 per cent , followed by @entity169 at 53.9 per cent			1
@entity170 had the highest homeownership rate at 72.9 percent			0
in terms of births , the birth rate for all women of childbearing age - 63 births per 1,000 women — was essentially flat in 2012 from the year before			2
meanwhile , overall migration among adults 55 and older held steady at 4.4 percent from 2012 to 2013 , up from a low of 4 percent in 2011			2
metro areas with the biggest gains included @entity183 , @entity184 , @entity109 and several in @entity56			0
many cities in the @entity186 , @entity187 and coastal areas posted losses			0
' the post-recession period has given a bigger boost to seniors than to young adults in their willingness to try out new places for retirement , ' said @entity197 , a demographer at the @entity198 who analyzed the figures			1
' many young adults , especially those without college degrees , are still stuck in place			1
' ' for them , low mobility might be more than a temporary lull and could turn into the ' new normal '			0
' the wait continues for @entity208 , 30 , of @entity209 , @entity210 after picking up a master 's degree in public health in 2008 , @entity208 moved from @entity214 to the @entity184 suburb with the plan of living with his parents for about six months			2
five years later , after struggling to find work in his field and switching his career path last year from health management to teaching kindergarten , @entity208 has opted to remain at his parents ' home until he can pay off more debt			0
he is now studying to earn a doctorate in education , amassing college debt of more than $ 110,000			0
' it 's a bit restraining after going away to college two times , but i 'm saving and my mom 's been very understanding , ' said @entity208 , who is optimistic he 'll soon be financially stable enough to live on his own			0
