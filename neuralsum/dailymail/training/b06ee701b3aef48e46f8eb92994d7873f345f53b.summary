@entity1 sports fans have become infamous for their bad behavior , and it was on display once again last night when they learned the @entity5 , a swarm of scantily clad , pretty young things responsible for cleaning the ice between periods during home games , had been replaced with an all - male crew			1
it all happened when the @entity14 took on the @entity15 monday night at the @entity16 in a pre-season game , and a group of men , and not women , hit the ice to do some cleaning			2
the boos and jeers inside the stadium were deafening as these gentlemen , who , unlike their predecessors , got to wear pants and a fleece , went to work on the ice			0
' no # flyersicegirls this year , but just wanted to say thanks to one of our biggest fans @ @entity52 & to all # @entity53 for being awesome , ' she wrote			0
the girls would hit the ice every game wearing nothing but a midriff - baring top , hot pants , leg warmers and their skates , not the best outfit for a place where the temperatures is around 50 degrees			1
the @entity14 also play an outdoor classic every year , where the temperature is about 20 degrees			0
freezing work conditions : the girls ' costumes ( above left and right ) consisted of little more than a midriff - baring top , hot pants and leg warmers poor treatment : according to a profile published earlier this year , the girls were underpaid , not allowed to speak to the athletes , and could not eat while in costume @entity80 wrote an article about the ice girls last year , and the all - female cleaning crew for another hockey team , the @entity84 , highlighting how little the girls were paid and the many strict rules they had to adhere too			1
among other things , the girls were not allowed to eat in public while wearing their costume and could not fraternize with any of the athletes , being told they should leave a bar or restaurant if they were out and one of the players came in			0
this negative coverage could be why the @entity5 were replaced by the new all - male cleaning crew .			2

@entity14 fans got very angry this week when they learned the team had replaced the @entity5 with an all - male cleaning crew
the @entity5 were a group of women who cleaned the ice during games wearing hot pants , midriff - baring tops , and leg warmers
it is *believed* they may have been *disbanded* after a profile of them revealed how underpaid they were , and the strict rules they were asked to follow
