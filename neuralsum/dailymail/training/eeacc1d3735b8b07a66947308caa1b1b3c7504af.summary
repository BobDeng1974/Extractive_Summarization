@entity0 is due formally to accept the vice-presidential nomination in a high - stakes speech to the @entity3 and tell voters that ‘ after four years of getting the run - around [ under president @entity6 ] , @entity5 needs a turnaround , and the man for the job is governor @entity10 ’			1
according to prepared excerpts , the @entity12 congressman will say : ‘ i accept the calling of my generation to give our children the @entity5 that was given to us , with opportunity for the young and security for the old – and i know that we are ready			0
our nominee is sure ready			0
his whole life has prepared him for this moment – to meet serious challenges in a serious way , without excuses and idle words			0
’ the selection of @entity0 , 42 , a staunch fiscal conservative who advocates tackling @entity5 ’s national debt crisis head on , including by reforming entitlement programmes like @entity32 , has energised @entity10 ’s candidacy and put the state of @entity12 into play			1
@entity36 : @entity3 vice presidential nominee @entity0 was seen practicing on stage earlier wednesday in preparation for his prime - time address at 10pm this evening family friendly : @entity0 was joined onstage by his children ( left - right ) @entity42 , @entity44 and @entity45			1
in excerpts of the speech that were released hours before the live event , he quotes his father 's words of wisdom even if he does not win the vice-presidency in november , @entity0 – 23 years younger than @entity10 - is viewed as a star of the next political generation – much as @entity6 was when he spoke at the 2004 @entity56 convention			1
in what promises to be a poignant moment , @entity0 will recall his father , who died of a heart attack when the future congressman was just 16 , saying : ‘ my @entity62 used to say to me , “ son			2
you have a choice : you can be part of the problem , or you can be part of the solution ”			0
‘ the present administration has made its choices			0
and @entity10 and i have made ours : before the math and the momentum overwhelm us all , we are going to solve this nation ’s economic problems			2
and i ’m going to level with you : we do n’t have that much time			0
but if we are serious , and smart , and we lead , we can do this			0
’ @entity0 will also take @entity6 to task for his health care reform , pushed through in 2010 without a single @entity3 vote			2
‘ @entity81 comes to more than two thousand pages of rules , mandates , taxes , fees , and fines that have no place in a free country , ’ he is due to say			0
‘ the president has declared that the debate over government - controlled health care is over			0
that will come as news to the millions of @entity5 who will elect @entity10 so we can repeal @entity81 … we have a plan for a stronger middle class , with the goal of generating 12 million new jobs over the next four years			2
’ he is also planning to say that this election will be decisive and a stark contrast is on offer between @entity6 and vice president @entity103 and the @entity104			0
big night : @entity0 and his wife @entity105 appear on stage at the @entity12 delegation 's @entity108 event on wednesday ‘ the right that makes all the difference now is the right to choose our own leaders			1
you are entitled to the clearest possible choice because the time for choosing is drawing near			0
so here is our pledge			0
we will not duck the tough issues – we will lead			0
‘ we will not spend four years blaming others – we will take responsibility			0
we will not try to replace our founding principles , we will reapply our founding principles			0
the work ahead will be hard			0
these times demand the best of us – all of us , but we can do this			0
together , we can do this			0
’ ahead of his high - profile speech that cements his place as @entity10 's running mate and introduces him to the nation , the congressman spent most of the day with his children , keeping his mind elsewhere			1
the @entity139 made a quick visit to the cavernous hall and then to a celebration of @entity12 's beer and brats			0
asked by reporters this afternoon about his speech , the typically chatty congressman played coy as he tinkered with the height of the podium and got used to the echo from the microphones while his three children practiced waving to the crowd			2
' you 'll find out tonight , ' @entity0 said			2
' why would i spoil it now ? ' family man : @entity0 takes his wife @entity159 and their children @entity42 and @entity44 to a soundcheck during the third day of the @entity163 in @entity164 he and his wife then headed to the @entity12 delegation 's @entity108 event , where he tried to downplay the significance of the speech just a few hours away to the thousands in the hall and the millions watching on television			1
' i 've got to give this speech later on today so i 'm going to keep it brief and save my voice , ' he said			0
@entity0 said he and @entity10 would outline their plans for the country in the coming weeks , starting with his own speech			1
' we 're going to give the country a very clear choice that they deserve , ' @entity0 said			2
@entity0 is expected to talk about his @entity183 immigrant ancestors and small - town values , offering a personal presentation of a lawmaker largely known for sober policy analysis			1
he will also praise @entity10 , the @entity3 presidential nominee , and criticize president @entity6			1
the speech will likely be heavy on personality and light on policy , the latest example of @entity0 deferring to @entity10 's preferences			1
as @entity0 puts it , @entity10 is ' the boss			1
' checking it out : @entity45 ( left ) , @entity44 ( center ) and @entity42 ( right ) all soaked up the spotlight during the rehearsal that message was underscored in @entity0 's preparations			1
wearing a blazer and open - collar shirt , he asked to be shown where @entity10 will be seated , conscious that he would speak in front of the man he hopes will be his future partner			1
@entity0 and his team , a mix of longtime aides and new advisers , have spent a chunk of the past few weeks writing - and re-writing - the speech			1
drafts have been emailed from his campaign plane and his kitchen table in @entity216 , to speechwriters in @entity164 and top @entity10 advisers at the @entity220 campaign headquarters			2
early versions were scrapped and adjusted to include bits of @entity0 's natural , easygoing speaking style			1
in between campaign events and daily workouts , @entity0 has been working to put his own voice into the drafts			2
he is an experienced speechwriter , having served in that capacity for 1996 vice presidential nominee @entity229 and former education secretary @entity230			1
but at campaign events , @entity0 has tended to favor policy over his personal story			1
from @entity233 to @entity234 to @entity235 , he talks more often about the nation 's debt and deficit than his own life as a congressional aide who became a congressman at age 28			2
the 42 - year - old is more comfortable citing @entity244 statistics than real people			0
@entity10 's aides want that to change			2
advisers are pushing @entity0 toward more personal territory			2
pulling the heartstrings : the hope among @entity10 's team is that the nation gets to know @entity0 's story , one they say working - class voters could relate to the hope among @entity10 's team is that the nation gets to know @entity0 's story , one they say working - class voters could relate to			1
left unsaid is that @entity0 's policy positions , specifically his contentious budget proposals , have caused headaches for @entity10 and dominated the storyline of the campaign since he was introduced as the running mate			1
@entity0 planned to talk wednesday not just about @entity10 's promises to repair the economy and what they contend are @entity6 's failures to do so , but also about his own upbringing			1
a message of self - reliance is set for a prominent role in the speech			0
@entity0 previewed his message earlier this week at the high school he attended two decades ago			0
he spoke of his ancestors ' journey in the 1850s from @entity282 to @entity12			0
aides sought to lower expectations and cautioned against expecting a blockbuster speech like the one delivered by 2008 vice presidential nominee @entity286			1
instead , @entity0 is likely to paint himself as a reasonable governing partner for @entity10 .			1

portions of vice presidential nominee @entity0 's speech were released wednesday afternoon in preparation for his *primetime* speech this evening
a policy - wonk known for talking *logistics* , @entity0 will reveal more of his personal history in the speech and talk about his family life
comes day after @entity302 's speech attempted to ' *humanize* ' @entity10
