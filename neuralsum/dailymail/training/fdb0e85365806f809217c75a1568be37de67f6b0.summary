bacteria that eats radioactive waste has been discovered in the @entity2 - and could now be used to help ' eat away ' at nuclear waste			1
scientists at the @entity5 say they have found ' extremophile ' bacteria that can survive the harsh conditions of underground radioactive waste disposal sites			1
the findings , published in the @entity10 ( @entity11 of @entity12 ) journal , say the tiny waste - eating single - cell organisms could help with @entity16 's growing problem of nuclear waste disposal			1
scientists discovered the bacteria in contaminated soil in an old lime kiln in the @entity2 , pictured it is the first time that scientists - who discovered the bacteria in contaminated soil in an old lime kiln - have found microbes like it			1
@entity16 currently has enough waste to fill four @entity26 and how it is disposed of is a growing problem			0
huge amounts of waste will be encased in concrete before being stored in underground vaults for thousands of years			2
but when surface water eventually reaches the waste , it will react with the cement and become highly alkaline			0
this triggers chemical reactions that create isosaccharinic acid ( @entity39 ) , which can react with the toxic elements which make up the radioactive component of nuclear waste			1
if the acid binds to radionuclides , such as uranium , then the radionuclides becomes soluble			0
it means it is more likely to flow out of the vaults , potentially seeping into drinking water and into the food chain			0
@entity16 currently has enough ' intermediate ' waste to fill four @entity26 and how it is disposed of is a growing problem			0
pictured : a waste disposal plant ( file pic ) but researchers say these microbes can use the @entity39 as a source of food under conditions that mimic those expected in disposal sites			1
for example , when there is no oxygen to help these bacteria break down the @entity39 , the microorganisms are able to breathe using other chemicals in the water , such as nitrate or iron			0
professor @entity72 of university 's @entity73 said : ' we are very interested in these @entity2 microorganisms			0
' given that they must have evolved to thrive at the highly alkaline lime - kiln site in only a few decades , it is highly likely that similar bacteria will behave in the same way and adapt to living off @entity39 in and around buried cement - based nuclear waste quite quickly			1
' nuclear waste will be remain buried deep underground for many thousands of years so there is plenty of time for the bacteria to become adapted			2
' our next step will be to see what impact they have on radioactive materials			0
we expect them to help keep radioactive materials fixed underground through their unusual dietary habits , and their ability to naturally degrade @entity96 ' the next step is to study the processes used to support life in the extreme conditions and to see what effect the bacteria has on radioactive waste .			2
