@entity0 has insisted his £ 1.5million purse offer to @entity2 comes with no strings attached , but efforts to make a super-fight with @entity6 remain deadlocked			1
@entity0 unveiled a cheque with his offer to @entity10 cameras in a bid to force a deal with the @entity14 super-bantamweight champion , as the @entity16 promoter upped the ante in a bid to book a july 18 date at @entity19			1
however , @entity2 ’s promoters , @entity20 , headed by former world champ @entity21 , released a press release in response to the offer , claiming they were awaiting formal communication from @entity0 ’s @entity27 before renewing negotiations over the much - hyped bout			2
@entity0 presents the cheque for £ 1.5m to set - up @entity6 's fight with @entity2 @entity16 boss @entity0 said the cheque offered 1.5m reasons for the two boxers to fight @entity6 stares down the camera to tell @entity2 to ' put his money where his mouth is ' tv rights were believed to be a major stumbling block in negotiations as @entity16 are tied to @entity40 , while @entity2 ’s recent title defence against @entity42 attracted millions of viewers between @entity44 in the @entity45 and @entity46			1
now @entity0 has seemingly attempted to force the fight with a big - money offer in the hope that the bout can be screened on @entity51			2
while past negotiations were believed to have collapsed due to a failure to agree a deal on future promotional ‘ options ’ on fights , the @entity16 promoter also insisted he has not demanded rights to promote @entity2 ’s future fights			1
‘ nothing at all — no options , no rematch clause , absolutely nothing , ’ @entity0 told @entity59 when questioned on whether such terms were included in his £ 1.5m offer			1
‘ he can have this fight , he can go back to whatever broadcaster he wants [ after it ]			0
he can go and move to the moon if he wants , it ’s nothing to do with us			0
’ @entity6 is the defending @entity71 super-bantamweight champion and wants to fight @entity2 in @entity19 @entity6 celebrates his win over @entity73 at the @entity74 in november last year @entity21 declined to comment further on the saga when contacted by @entity59 , refusing to elaborate on @entity20 ’ statement which said they ‘ have made several attempts to organise a follow - up meeting with @entity0 of @entity16 to progress these negotiations ’			1
the @entity20 statement added : ‘ if @entity16 are interested in joining @entity20 in staging this domestic superfight , we recommend @entity16 accept the invitation for a follow - up meeting			2
’ @entity0 countered the @entity20 statement , telling @entity59 : ‘ we just want to get it done , it ’s so frustrating … i know their statement said we turned down another meeting but that ’s because it was getting nowhere			2
we ’re trying to make things happen			0
‘ the only thing that @entity20 want is they want to co-promote the show			0
we ’re bringing all the money , we ’re putting all the money up , ’ said the @entity16 promoter			1
‘ if there was another broadcaster that they were willing to work with , who could throw a load of money at this fight , then make us an offer			0
we ’re in such a strong position , but we ’re still being fair			0
@entity6 is the one taking all the risk here			0
if it does n’t do that great at the box office , @entity6 might get only £ 400 - 500,000 and @entity2 still gets his £ 1.5m , there is no risk			1
' this is the offer that i believe has to make @entity2 say yes			0
i ’ve already responded [ to @entity114 ] to say “ if you want to co-promote , co-promote it ” , ’ added @entity0			0
