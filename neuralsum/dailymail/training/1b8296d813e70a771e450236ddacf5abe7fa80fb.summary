sherpa @entity1 's son has claimed that @entity2 has become a cash - cow for the @entity5 government and the overcrowded peak is now strewn with rubbish			1
@entity8 says his famous sherpa father would be saddened that the mountain has become something of a tourist attraction , with hundreds of climbers attempting to tackle the world 's highest peak			1
@entity8 has also urged @entity5 authorites to take action to limit the number of climbers , and to do more to protect the @entity20 in the wake of an avalanche that killed 16 of them last month			1
anger : sherpa @entity8 's son @entity8 ( left ) says his father , pictured right with sir @entity27 , would be saddened by the fact the mountain has become a ' cash cow ' for the @entity5 government ‘ if he were alive , he would be very sad to see how heavily trafficked and desecrated the mountain has become , ’ he told @entity31			1
‘ it is a travesty , what has happened to this beautiful mountain			0
@entity2 has become a cash cow , where the government takes millions of dollars a year , but very little or nothing actually goes back			0
such is the popularity of climbing @entity2 that mountaineers now have to form queues to stand on the summit , and @entity8 said that many leave the peak littered with rubbish			1
last month 16 @entity20 died in an avalanche as they traversed a treacherous ice fall			1
queue : hundreds try to climb @entity2 every year and @entity8 , @entity1 ¿ s son , has said that his father who died in 1986 would be upset by what has become of the mountain crowds : a mountaineer returns to base camp to the cheers of fellow climbers after successfully climbing @entity2 several sherpa guides were hauling climbing gear between camps when a chunk of ice tore loose and triggered an avalanche			1
thirteen bodies were recovered and three @entity20 are still missing , presumed dead			0
it was the worst single disaster on the mountain and speaks volumes of the demands placed upon the natives by @entity70 , according to @entity8			2
the families of @entity20 killed on the mountain have received just £ 245 compensation , a figure that has resulted in many sherpas threatening to stop escorting climbers up @entity2			1
the sherpas have argued that they deserve far more — including more insurance money , more financial aid for the families of the victims and new regulations that would ensure climbers ' rights			2
earlier this year @entity5 tourist authorities announced a number of initiatives aimed at cutting congestion on the mountain , including plans to introduce separate fixed ropes for climbers ascending and descending near the summit , and posting government officials at the mountain 's base camp to monitor climbers			2
but @entity8 has called upon the @entity5 government to go further and limit the number of mountaineers allowed to climb @entity2 every year , and urged climbers to consider the welfare of the @entity20			1
@entity103 has become a tourist attraction and the mountain is strewn with rubbish			0
hundreds try to climb @entity2 every year and @entity8 last year 800 people climbed the mountain during the spring season , which amounts to just two or three occasions in may when the weather is favourable enough to enable a safe climb			1
the @entity2 climbing season provides livelihoods for thousands of @entity5 guides and porters , and climbers have long relied on @entity20 for everything from carrying gear to cooking food to high - altitude guiding			2
without them , reaching the summit would be almost impossible			0
@entity8 described how sherpas now must not only help guide @entity70 up the world 's highest mountain , but must also help carry the climbers ' luxury tents , and even items such as coffee machines			1
@entity8 , 51 , is vice-president of the @entity132 based in @entity133 , which helps raise money for education and health - care projects for @entity20 , nepalis and @entity138 throughout the region			0
he was speaking on the release of beyond the @entity141 in cinemas this friday , which documents his father ’s famous climb with @entity146 sir @entity27 in 1953			0
on the way : @entity27 ( left ) and @entity1 on their ascent to the summit of @entity2 in may 1953 since their mission , more than 4,000 climbers have reached the 29,035ft summit , while hundreds of people have died trying			0
@entity8 described the motivation that drove his father 's team as ' pure ' , and inspired by the drive to achieve something no one else had done before , unlike some who make the climb today - many of whom , he says , simply want to get an extra line on their cvs			2
@entity8 , who died in 1986 at the age of 71 , and sir @entity27 were asked until the end of their days which of them had reached the summit first — for many years they never answered , insisting that they share the honour			0
finally , they admitted that @entity27 , who died in 2008 , was first			0
@entity8 said : ‘ people of that generation climbed with the simple hope of going on an adventure , of doing something no one had done before			0
everybody was working together and the sense of comradeship was unique			0

sherpa @entity8 's son @entity8 says his father would be ' very sad ' to see how heavily trafficked the mountain has become
@entity2 is now packed with climbers and 800 attempted to tackle it last may
last month 16 sherpas were killed in an avalanche on the mountain
but families of the dead men have been offered just £ 245 compensation prompting anger and threats of a *boycott* of the mountain
