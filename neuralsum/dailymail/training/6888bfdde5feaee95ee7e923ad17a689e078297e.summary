by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity3 players looked to be in a relaxed mood as they headed out for another pre-season training session in @entity6 on monday			1
the likes of @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 were all smiles as @entity13 star @entity12 signed autographs for fans outside the team 's hotel			1
@entity8 and @entity18 enjoyed a trip to the famous @entity21 sign as the attacking pair posed for photographs before chatting to @entity24			1
@entity41 has already spent upwards of £ 50million on @entity43 and @entity44 , but the new @entity3 boss looks set to add more faces before the season begins			1
the @entity48 has been linked with @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 since taking charge in may			1
@entity25 is already making space for new acquisitions by off loading @entity56 , who may seal his transfer to @entity58 on monday			2
@entity37 says there is plenty of cash available to @entity25 if he decides he needs to strengthen further			1
' there is no fixed budget			1
financially we are extremely strong , we have funds available , ' @entity3 's executive vice-chairman told @entity24 in an interview filmed on the club 's pre-season tour of the @entity27			1
' louis is the boss and is assessing what 's going on but we have been in dialogue for some time about targets so there is a lot of work going on behind the scenes ... we 're continuing to move forward on some of those targets ... so watch this space			0
@entity81 faces : the @entity3 stars pose with fans during their pre-season trip ' the time he ( @entity25 ) spends here as well ( in @entity27 ) he 'll be able to assess more what he 's got and continue to tweak the decisions if we need to			1
' we want to do what it takes to win the title			0
' @entity3 finished seventh under @entity93 last year , meaning they will be without @entity95 football this term for the first time in almost two decades			2
@entity37 does not believe that will put potential signings off a move to @entity102 , @entity98 added : ' i 've experienced a lot of conversations with agents and players and we are still a huge attraction to top football stars around the world - there is no doubt about that			1
' we 've already invested in two new fantastic players			0
' as a consequence of the club 's failure to qualify for @entity118 , @entity3 will play a vastly reduced number of matches this season			2
in charge : @entity41 ( left ) and @entity123 watch on during a @entity3 training session @entity25 will therefore need fewer players , so there is a high possibility that some squad members will be moved on before the transfer window closes			1
@entity56 will follow @entity131 and @entity132 out of the door despite only signing a new contract two months ago			0
@entity1 understands the @entity135 international is closing in on a move to @entity138 and could even be announced as a @entity58 player on monday			0
midfielder @entity140 , who was loaned to @entity141 last season , and misfiring striker @entity143 are free to leave			2
the likes of @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity140 and @entity148 all have question marks over their futures			0
@entity151 to see you : @entity12 signs autographs for fans outside the team hotel when asked whether players would leave , @entity37 said : ' yes , i think so			1
' the manager makes that decision and a few players have already gone and there may well be a few others that go			0
' it 's also worth commenting that we 're not in @entity118 this year ( so ) there 's less games , maybe the manager takes the view that he wants a tighter squad to bed in			0
' if you do the analysis over last year , @entity171 performed extremely well with a smaller number of players but that 's a decision for the manager			0
' @entity37 is convinced the @entity3 boss will not shy away from making any tough calls			1
eyes elsewhere : @entity10 and @entity148 watch on with @entity25 as they grab a breather ready for the new season : @entity8 talks to @entity24 during his visit to @entity21 ' we 've got someone who has confidence in himself about making difficult decisions and , when you boil down what makes a great manager , one of the key characteristics is making difficult decisions and we 've clearly got a manager who can do that , ' @entity37 added			1
' i 've personally found him very warm			0
he 's a very clear communicator and very direct			0
i like that in people ; i 'm a very direct person myself			0
' failing to qualify for @entity118 was a big blow to @entity3 , who have won the @entity204 on three occasions			2
charges : @entity25 is expected to name a strong side for @entity3 's pre season opener against @entity209 together : the @entity3 players leave the @entity36 hotel ahead of training @entity37 wants an instant return to the biggest competition in @entity95 football , but he also stressed his desire for @entity3 to challenge for the @entity217 too			1
' we 're a club that absolutely should be in the @entity204 , ' he said			0
' that 's what our fans want , that 's what our players want and that 's what every member of staff wants			0
good laugh : @entity43 and @entity146 head down to the training field ahead of a session with @entity25 pre-season : @entity8 looked in a relaxed mood as he boards the @entity3 team coach ' we have to strive to win			1
we 're not here to be an also - ran ; we 're here to win trophies to add to that huge , incredible list that we 've won over many years			0
' @entity25 may have been in his post for only five days , but @entity37 says the 62 - year - old , who led @entity245 to the last four of the @entity246 , has already made a big impact			2
' i 'm hearing a lot of good feedback from a lot of people about him and there is a huge amount of goodwill towards him and the coaching staff , ' @entity37 said			2
' every interaction he 's having with people is leaving an imprint , which is superb			0
' support : @entity3 fans line - up outside their team 's hotel as they hope to catch a glimpse of the players @entity268 how @entity269 are getting on with their @entity27 tour - match highlights			2
