@entity1 football coach @entity0 was the talk of the @entity5 president ’s dinner after he was upstaged by inspirational speaker @entity6 , @entity8 ’s victorious @entity7 captain			1
@entity0 and @entity6 were interviewed on stage by @entity10 ’ @entity11 on the subject of leadership			2
but @entity0 paled next to @entity6 , who gave a masterclass at the @entity16 ’s function in explaining the attention to detail , perception and man - management which went into beating the @entity21 at @entity22			2
it would not have been @entity6 ’s intention but his thoroughly modern approach to leading a team only exposed @entity0 ’s old - school philosophy			2
and @entity29 technical director @entity28 , plus @entity29 board members @entity31 and @entity32 , would surely have gone away thinking @entity33 should be @entity0 ’s last major tournament as @entity1 boss			1
@entity0 was upstaged on stage at the @entity5 president 's dinner @entity6 , the @entity7 - winning captain , showed the @entity1 boss up with his attention to detail certainly any new contract should depend on how @entity1 perform in @entity42			2
@entity44 ’s golf team at the @entity45 , including world no 1 @entity46 , will be the next side to benefit from the @entity6 factor			0
@entity52 cycling champion @entity51 ’s seemingly fanciful attempt to learn to ride well enough to compete in next year ’s @entity53 at @entity54 is widely regarded as a @entity56 publicity stunt			1
however , @entity57 , winner of the same race yesterday , is one of the few who thinks @entity51 will be ‘ fine ’			2
@entity51 ’s attempts to race at @entity54 next year is widely regarded as a @entity56 publicity stunt nothing stops record - breaking @entity64 trainer @entity63 at @entity54 apart from the currency exchange			1
@entity63 has @entity67 ’s biggest spenders among his owners yet he withdrew surprisingly at the £ 200,000 mark in an auction battle with @entity71 for five - year - old @entity72 , who went for £ 205,000 at the @entity74			0
@entity63 explained the horse had got too expensive in terms of euros , which are struggling against the pound			0
@entity63 ( right ) withdrew from an auction because the horse had got too expensive in terms of euros the patrons of @entity54 ’s @entity85 club , grand racing families whose relatives safeguarded the future of the racecourse in the 1960s , have seen their traditional boxes bulldozed to make way for the new £ 45million grandstand			1
and the old guard are upset they will not be able to keep bringing food and drink into the new premises			0
their main gripe concerns having to pay big prices for ordinary plonk , instead of enjoying their own far superior stuff			0
@entity103 @entity102 @entity104 , the @entity105 racing correspondent and brother of royal trainer @entity107 , did a special commentary on the @entity109 because the station ’s betting expert , coral pr director @entity110 , was riding			1
and @entity104 called @entity112 , who finished in midfield , as first home because he was riding in similar red colours to the winner			0
@entity104 , commentating in overdrive in the belief @entity112 had triumphed , only realised his error after the field passed the post			0
@entity105 still played the gaffe when @entity112 gave his tips yesterday			0
@entity104 called @entity110 's horse as winning the @entity109 , it was actually @entity125 ( pictured ) @entity126 , ready to let broadcasters tailor their bids for the big meetings in the next tv tender , will find @entity131 keen to look at screening the @entity54			1
this only adds to the belief that selling the showcase events separately is the most lucrative way forward for racing , especially as viewing figures for @entity139 ’s monopoly terrestrial coverage are in steep decline			0
@entity131 are keen to look at the opportunity to screen the @entity54 next year , even without @entity142 @entity145 president @entity144 ’s three election rivals will be boosted by the @entity147 and @entity148 confederation , a previous @entity144 stronghold , deciding in @entity150 that their member countries can vote individually for their candidate of choice			1
this comes a week after @entity155 did not give its expected total support for @entity144 at their summit			0
@entity144 ’s three election rivals will be boosted by the @entity147 and @entity148 confederation @entity160 , paranoid about @entity54 blunders following presenter @entity162 ’s ‘ rose - * * * * * * glasses ’ slip , found themselves apologising twice for trainer @entity167 ’s mild ‘ oh s * * * ’ comment to correspondent @entity168 after @entity170 won the @entity171 .			1

@entity0 's interview *alongside* @entity6 would surely have @entity29 bosses thinking @entity33 should be his last tournament as coach
@entity51 's riding plans are regarding as a @entity56 publicity stunt
only the euro - pound rate is stopping trainer @entity63 at @entity54
patrons of @entity54 's @entity85 club are upset at not being able to bring their own food and drink into their new premises after being moved
@entity105 's @entity104 dropped a *clanger* , calling the *wrong* winner
@entity131 are keen to look at screening the @entity54 in future
@entity144 's @entity145 election rivals have received a boost
@entity160 found themselves apologising twice for trainer @entity167 ’s mild ‘ oh s * * * ’ comment at @entity54 on *friday*
