by @entity0 a man whose brother died during the @entity4 war is to retrace his footsteps almost 30 years on from the conflict			1
in 1982 , @entity8 @entity7 was killed during the battle for two sisters , and now his brother @entity11 plans to make an arduous 75 - mile journey past the spot in tribute			1
mr @entity7 was 19 when he lost his brother , who was 20 and had been a @entity8 for just a year			1
loving memory : @entity17 , @entity7 and @entity18 at their home in @entity20 in march 1982 , shortly before the @entity8 left for the @entity4			1
right , @entity11 training for his falklands challenge this year @entity7 , from @entity23 , @entity20 , died alongside comrade corporal @entity24 during the battle			1
both served with @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity8 , which is based in @entity29			2
@entity18 and @entity30 , who was the company commander in 1982 , are now about to travel the original 120km ( 75 mile ) route across @entity33 and will pay their respects at two sisters			1
the men will be laden with heavy kit for the long journey - a @entity8 practice known as a ' yomp ' - and will cover 17 miles each day in wintry conditions			1
when mr @entity7 and mr @entity30 reach two sisters , on their way from @entity44 to @entity45 , they will stop for a ceremony in honour of the fallen @entity8			1
a piper from @entity49 , @entity50 , the @entity51 ( 4 scots ) , is expected to play @entity53 , a @entity55 song which means ' alone with my thoughts ' and was written for @entity7 after he died by family friends @entity59 and the reverend @entity60			1
tragic death : @entity7 with 9 troop , @entity27 , on @entity63 , two days before the landing at @entity65 in may 1982 it will be the first time mr @entity7 has visited the @entity4 and the second time mr @entity30 has returned to the battlefield since the night of june 11 , 1982			2
the idea for the yomp came from @entity71 's son @entity70 , but he and his brother , @entity72 , are no longer able to take part for family reasons			2
the pair , who will be joined by colour sergeant @entity76 , a @entity8 serving in the @entity4 , are now gearing up for the challenge , which starts on may 13			2
they will be carrying equipment weighing about 20kg and raising money for the @entity81 during the challenge			0
they have had a royal seal of approval from the @entity86 , who sent them a letter of support last week			0
fallen comrades : @entity24 , left , and @entity7 , right , on @entity63 in may 1982 just before both were killed during the battle fro two sisters mr @entity7 , a painter and decorator from @entity23 , said : ' i 'm a 49 - year - old civilian , so it 's all new to me			1
' i 'd like to think i was already reasonably fit but i 've had to try and get much fitter for this as it is going to be very difficult			0
' my wife and her friends are running the @entity102 on may 13 , the same day that we start the yomp , and they 're raising money for the same charity			0
' i never thought i would get the opportunity to do anything like this			0
it 's the first and probably the only time i will go to the @entity4			0
' mr @entity30 , 64 , from @entity111 , said he is taking part in the trip in memory of his two fallen comrades but that the most important thing for him is to support mr @entity7			1
then and now : left , @entity30 with the officers of 45 @entity118 at @entity119 , @entity65 , in may 1982 , two days before the start of the yomp			0
right , training in @entity111 in february mr @entity30 , who now works at @entity123 for the @entity124 , recalled his last memory of @entity7			2
he said : ' @entity7 was n't very big physically but he was very determined			2
' i remember just before we moved out of the patrol base after receiving orders for the attack , we were getting our kit ready and he was putting on a huge pack			0
' i jokingly asked if he was going to be okay with it			0
' he gave me one of those looks , and i knew of course that there was never going to be any problem there			0
that 's the last time i remember seeing him			0
' he added : ' we were delighted to receive a letter from @entity142 the @entity86 , as captain general royal marines , commending us and wishing us luck on our expedition , which he indicated was a unique and fitting tribute to corporal @entity24 and @entity147			0
