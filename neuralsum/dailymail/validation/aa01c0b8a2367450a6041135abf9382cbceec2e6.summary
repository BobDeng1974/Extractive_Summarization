it was a decade ago that @entity1 , who has captained @entity2 528 times , first learned the tricks of the role under the tutelage of @entity7			1
after impressing @entity7 upon inheriting the armband from @entity9 , the manager wanted to see @entity1 evolve from a very good centre half into a great captain , using his profile to control games and influence decisions in the way @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 did			1
like them , @entity1 proved quite an expert			1
it is partly why he has been one of @entity25 football ’s most successful modern captains and why @entity26 risked — and lost — his job trying to restore him as @entity29 skipper			0
the @entity2 players surround referee @entity31 at @entity32 as he brandishes the red card @entity2 captain @entity1 ( left ) reacts after @entity34 's tackle on @entity35 in the first - half @entity1 ( centre ) led the protests as he screamed at the referee following @entity34 's first - half challenge it is also why @entity7 has promised another one - year deal to the defender , who turns 35 this year			1
@entity1 understands what his manager wants			1
this includes turning the heat on officials , as he did on wednesday against @entity50 when he led nine excited team - mates in pursuit of referee @entity31 to ensure @entity34 was sent off			1
@entity54 ’s @entity53 knew how to exaggerate fouls , pressure the referee and cultivate their reputation as the team most sinned against			2
@entity7 and @entity50 midfielder @entity59 discovered this when they were at @entity62			2
no - one can make slight contact appear quite as painful as @entity64			2
@entity2 's players surround referee @entity31 as he sends off @entity34 ( second right ) @entity2 went close up with @entity53 at times , including the nights when @entity69 found infamy and @entity1 was sent off for kicking @entity71 and banned for the @entity73 final			1
everyone is at it , as @entity1 said			2
everyone always has been , to some degree			0
but @entity2 always manage to offend			2
even when there is much to admire about them			0
@entity80 claimed it ’s ‘ not the @entity85 way ’ but traditional sporting integrity has faded from view			0
winning matters more than ever			0
managers find ways to do it			0
@entity2 defender @entity90 grabs @entity92 's @entity91 around the neck last month @entity2 striker @entity94 ( right ) stamped on @entity95 's @entity98 during a fiery @entity97 clash wednesday ’s snarling exit from @entity100 epitomised @entity2 from the first @entity7 era : winning ugly and losing badly			1
this was one of the issues which drove owner @entity105 and @entity7 apart in the first place			0
there are differences this time but the defining image of the second leg against @entity50 is the latest in a series of skirmishes			2
last month , @entity90 grabbed @entity92 ’s @entity91 by the throat as @entity2 swarmed around referee @entity114 in reaction to a tackle by @entity117 , which also led to a red card			1
both teams were fined £ 30,000 by the @entity120 for failing to control their players and @entity2 were warned about surrounding the referee			1
@entity2 striker @entity94 makes a beeline for @entity34 as the referee raises the red card last month , @entity94 was banned for stamping on @entity95 ’s @entity98 during a physical @entity97 semi-final			1
there were flashes last season : two red cards at @entity130 and touchline eruptions featuring @entity7 and @entity132			0
more recently , @entity133 was dismissed for pushing @entity134 over			0
the tackle by @entity134 was bad and sparked a furious reaction from those in blue , who rushed @entity139			0
@entity90 grabbed his hand to stop him raising the red card			0
others deploy such tactics — @entity144 was sent off for pulling the referee ’s shirt on monday in a game where @entity148 seemed joined to @entity149 — but @entity2 are perhaps the most committed			1
the @entity151 pundits were scathing of @entity2 's ' pathetic ' behaviour at @entity32 on wednesday at the slightest contact in the penalty area , they hit the deck and if the appeals are rejected the ensuing mass protest can feature half - a - dozen people fuming on the touchline			1
if there is a fierce tackle , the victim exaggerates the pain , while the team swarm around the referee			2
some sprint half the length of the pitch to create panic and cloud the referee ’s judgment			2
get enough around the ref and he has no idea who said what or who to book			0
call it protection for @entity182 , who has been kicked a lot			0
call it a protection racket			0
under @entity187 rules @entity2 would probably have been charged with failing to control their players , who constantly surrounded the referee on wednesday			1
fortunately for them , no such action exists under @entity100 rules			0
@entity7 , questioning a decision with the officials , saw his @entity2 side crash out of @entity100 the @entity2 squad are left reflecting what might have been after the costly 2 - 2 draw with @entity50 @entity7 muddies it all with his quotability and media strategy , always seeking to gain a small advantage , which can be vital at the rarefied end of @entity204 competition where teams are so tightly matched that each big decision is magnified in importance			1
perhaps it is a by - product of the arrogance the best teams need , because @entity211 and @entity212 over-stepped the mark when they ruled the roost			0
@entity7 ’s first spell at the @entity32 was littered with on - field confrontations and associated fines			0
he had been sacked but the tone was still set when , in march 2008 , @entity219 turned his back as he was booked by @entity221 and the @entity120 rolled out their @entity223 campaign , intended for the grassroots game , in the @entity187 too			0
it might be time to rekindle the spirit of the @entity223 campaign , because seven years is a long time in football and unlike the words of wisdom from @entity7 into @entity1 ’s shell - like , many of the basic points have been forgotten			1
former @entity235 defender @entity234 roars in celebration after he scored for @entity50 in the @entity73 tie			1

@entity2 crashed out of the @entity73 to @entity50
@entity34 was sent off for @entity50 for a challenge on @entity2 's @entity35
nine @entity2 players *immediately* surrounded referee @entity31 , led by captain @entity1 as @entity34 was then sent off
@entity34 and @entity245 were among those to voice *criticism*
@entity1 has defended his side 's behaviour during the 2 - 2 draw
