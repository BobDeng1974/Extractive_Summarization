the government 's attempt to slash net migration has suffered a serious setback today after official figures revealed the first increase in more than a year because too few people left @entity7			1
home secretary @entity8 and prime minister @entity9 want to reduce the difference between those leaving and entering the @entity7 from @entity13 countries to less than 100,000 before 2015			1
but the @entity14 ( @entity14 ) revealed a net flow of 176,000 migrants came to the @entity7 in the year to december 2012 , up from 153,000 in the year to september 2012 , ending five consecutive quarters of decline			1
picture of @entity7 : net migration is up after more people entered @entity7 than left , official figures revealed the @entity14 also revealed the number of children born in the @entity7 to @entity25 mothers has reached a record high as the country became one of the top 10 places of origin for foreign - born mothers for the first time			1
the figures come amid growing concern that @entity7 will face a new wave of eastern @entity37 immigration when access restrictions to the @entity7 labour market for @entity25 and @entity40 are lifted on january 1 next year			2
@entity41 mp , @entity42 's shadow immigration minister , said : ' the prime minister promised ' no ifs and no buts ' to get net migration down to the tens of thousands by the end of the @entity49			1
' but these figures show an increase in immigration over the last three months , with more @entity54 migrants arriving			0
' allowed to visit : this graph shows the number of visas issued to people from the main world regions the increase was driven by a drop in the number of migrants leaving @entity7 , which fell from 351,000 to 321,000 , while the number of immigrants arriving in the country also fell from 566,000 to 497,000			1
there has been a ' statistically significant ' decrease in the net migration of citizens from outside the @entity54 ( @entity54 ) to 157,000 in the year ending december 2012 from 204,000 the previous year , the @entity14 said			1
disappointment : a @entity72 pledge to reduce migration has faltered because figures show the over number has risen slightly as fewer @entity7 and @entity54 citizens emigrated from the country this was driven by a drop in immigration of @entity13 citizens , particularly in the number of citizens of new @entity85 countries , which includes @entity87 countries such as @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90 and @entity92 subcontinent countries such as @entity93 , @entity92 and @entity94			1
the drop in new @entity85 citizens immigrating to the @entity7 - from 151,000 in the year ending december 2011 to 97,000 in the year ending december 2012 - is as a result of fewer people arriving to study in the @entity7 from those countries			1
@entity100 , associate director at the @entity101 ( @entity101 ) , said : ' today 's statistics suggest the government is running out of options to meet its target to reduce net migration to less than 100,000 by 2015			2
' recent declines have been driven in large part by falling numbers of international students , which has come at a high economic cost , but this trend now appears to be levelling off			0
' the government can not further reduce student numbers without imposing even more significant costs on the education sector and the @entity7 economy			0
' dr @entity119 , acting director of the @entity120 at the @entity121 , said : ' this is a mixed outcome for the government in its plans to cut net migration to the ' tens of thousands '			2
' on the one hand net migration is still down on 2011 , but the recent increase shows that this downward trend is not reliably consistent and still depends partly on emigration of @entity7 citizens			1
' a total of 58,000 immigrants arrived from countries which joined the @entity54 in 2004 , including @entity134 , the @entity135 and @entity136 , down from 77,000 the previous year			0
the number of immigrants arriving for study in the @entity7 is now similar to the estimated number of people arriving to the @entity7 for work , the @entity14 said			0
around 180,000 immigrants arrived in the @entity7 for formal study in the year to december 2012 , compared to 232,000 the previous year			1
why they came : the majority of people coming into @entity7 were here for work or to study , statistics show elsewhere , the @entity14 revealed , in 2012 , one in eight or 12.4 % of the resident population of the @entity7 were born abroad , compared to one in 11 or 8.9 % in 2004			2
and in the same period , one in 13 or 7.8 % of the resident population of the @entity7 had @entity152 nationality , compared to one in 20 or 5 % in 2004			0
@entity92 was the most common @entity153 country of birth in 2012 , with 729,000 residents of the @entity7 born in @entity92 , while @entity134 was the most common @entity152 nationality in 2012 , with 700,000 residents of the @entity7 having @entity134 nationality			0
and in another pack of data , the @entity14 revealed a quarter of births - 25.9 % - in 2012 were to mothers born outside the @entity7 which was a slight increase from 25.5 % in 2011			0
@entity134 remains the most common country of birth for @entity153 born mothers in 2012 , while @entity25 moved into the top 10 most common countries of birth for @entity153 born mothers in 2012 , replacing @entity170			0
@entity94 remains the most common country of birth for @entity153 born fathers in 2012			0
immigration minister @entity173 said : ' immigration from outside the @entity54 is now at its lowest level for 14 years			0
' at the same time , there has been an increase in the number of sponsored student visa applications for our world - class universities , and an increase in the number of visas issued to skilled workers			0
' we are committed to bringing net migration down from the hundreds of thousands to the tens of thousands			2
