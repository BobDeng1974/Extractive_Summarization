this is the terrifying moment that two white vans nearly collided in the fast lane of a motorway after one driver passed a drink to another at almost 60mph			1
the perilous stunt was caught on the dashboard camera of another driver - who was directly behind the two reckless motorists as they headed down the @entity10			1
road safety campaigners have slammed the manoeuvre claiming it could have easily have led to a crash with potentially lethal consequences			1
the driver who captured the incident , who does not want to be identified , said the pair were driving at around 56mph and appear to be passing a can of drink between each other			1
he added : ' i thought it was a crazy and , frankly , a stupid thing to do			2
i was on my way home			0
i do a lot of driving as part of my job and i see a lot of stupid things on an almost daily basis			0
' you almost become immune to the stupidity , but this was particularly dangerous and it could have ended really badly			2
shocking : the van in the fast lane begins to drift left as the driver prepares himself for the dangerous hand over ' i really expected the vans to come together and for one of them to have his or her arms crushed			1
' police are now examining the footage and said they will be contacting the owners of the vehicles			0
road safety campaigners have condemned the drivers , saying they should be punished for risking other people 's lives			1
@entity69 , senior community engagement officer at the road safety charity brake , said : ' the video clearly shows that these two drivers were putting other road users and themselves in danger of being killed or seriously injured			1
stupidity : as he stretches out his arm to grab the can of drink he begins to lose control of his vehicle ' driving is the most dangerous thing we do on a daily basis and it deserves our full attention			2
every day , five people die on our roads and a further 61 are seriously injured			0
' this kind of irresponsible behaviour on our roads needs to be punished , using the full force of the law			0
' chief inspector @entity92 , from the @entity93 , said : ' passing items between vehicles while they are moving at speed increases the risk of a collision and is therefore not only dangerous to those inside the vehicles concerned , but also to other road users			2
' with regards to a video which appears to show two vans being driven in this way on the @entity10 on 24 september , we are currently examining the footage to see if any offences have been committed and we will be contacting the registered keepers of the vehicles about the matter			0
' the drivers can contact us on 101			0
' reckless : police are now examining the footage and said they will be contacting the owners of the vehicles			0
