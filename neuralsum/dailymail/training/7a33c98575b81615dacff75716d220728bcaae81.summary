huge reserves of the oldest water on @entity2 are locked deep within the planet 's crust and could be home to new forms of life , according to scientists			1
geologists have revealed that they have found water that is up to 2.7 billion years old in sites all over the world			1
they now estimate that there could be around 2.5 million cubic miles ( 11 cubic million km ) of this water buried beneath the ground			1
the scientists have also found tantalising hints that the highly salty water , which is spread out through tiny vein - like networks through the rock , could be home to life			1
the water appears to be reacting with the rock to produce large quantities of hydrogen in a similar way to what occurs around deep sea vents			2
most people would think twice about consuming something that has been hanging around for more than 2.5 billion years - making it older than some mountain ranges			1
but professor @entity47 could not resist having a taste			0
speaking to the @entity49 , she described it as tasting ' terrible ' due to the high salt content			0
reactions between the water and rock have made the water extremely salty and rich in minerals			2
she said : ' it is more viscous than tap water			2
' it has the consistency of a very light maple syrup			1
' it does n't have color when it comes out , but as soon as it comes into contact with oxygen it turns an orangy color because the minerals in it begin to form â€” especially the iron			0
' ' it tastes terrible			1
it is much saltier than seawater			0
you would definitely not want to drink this stuff			0
' they claim that this means the water trapped within the @entity2 's crust has the potential to support life			2
professor @entity47 , a geologist at the @entity83 , who led the work along with colleagues from @entity86 , said : ' this represents a quantum change in our understanding of the total volume of the @entity2 's crust that may be habitable			0
' it provides a " treasure map " of just how many other places on the planet we might want to do hunting for these microbes			0
' the researchers took samples of water trapped inside the @entity102 shield rocks - the oldest rocks in the @entity2 's crust - from 19 different mines in @entity105 , @entity22 and @entity106			1
here they were able to build up estimates for just how much water might be stored down the tiny cracks and pores that have formed in the ancient granite , basalt and quartzite rocks			1
such @entity102 rocks make up around 70 per cent of the @entity2 's crust			2
in one zinc and copper mine in @entity118 , @entity119 , the ancient water has been bubbling up to the surface for decades			1
noble gas isotopes , which accumulate in the water over time , have allowed the researchers to estimate the age of this water			1
they believe it has been trapped in the rock for more than a billion years and could even be up to 2.7 billion years old , when the rocks first formed			1
the researchers estimated the amount of hydrogen being produced by reactions between rocks in the precambrian crust ( exposed rock is marked blue while buried rock is marked green ) after taking samples of water from mines ( marked by yellow dots ) in @entity105 , @entity22 , @entity106 and around @entity142 professor @entity143 said : ' the waters show us an incredible spectrum of residence times - from tens of thousands of years in age near the surface , to tens of millions of years residence time in the deep gold mines of @entity22 , and last year we reported on waters form the @entity152 with more than a billion years residence time			1
' investigating them all and finding out where life occurs and how much it differs from one fracture to another will be an extraordinary adventure over the coming years			0
' she said that the huge quantities of hydrogen rich water in the @entity2 's crust was a ' sleeping giant ' that could be a source of possible energy for life			2
water trapped within tiny veins in ancient rock can preserve chemicals from the environment long ago in 2006 scientists discovered rock and chemical eating bacteria living in @entity174 mines in @entity22 , 1.7 miles ( 2.8km ) under ground			1
here the microbes were found to be using hydrogen and sulfates to survive in the salty water that filled tiny fractures			2
similar types of bacteria have been found living in the hydrothermal vents that form on the sea bed , allowing entire ecosystems to flourish			0
professor @entity143 and her colleagues believe that there could be entirely new undiscovered forms of life and ancient bacteria living in the viscous salt waters that leak through the oldest rocks in the @entity2 's crust			1
their work , which is published in the journal @entity199 and was also presented at the fall meeting of the @entity201 , could also provide clues about where life on @entity205 , if it exists , could be found			0
@entity205 surface consists of rocks that are billions of years old and have the potential to produce hydrogen in the same way as those on @entity2			2
@entity47 says she has tasted the water as it is a quick way of finding the saltiest samples researchers took samples of the highly salty water in 19 mines around the world to test for hydrogen content another recent discovery of flourishing colonies of slow growing bacteria in seams of coal , 8000 feet below the sea bed off the coast of @entity228			1
professor @entity143 said : ' if the ancient rocks of @entity2 are producing this much hydrogen , it may be that similar processes are taking place on @entity205			1
' her colleague , professor @entity234 , from the @entity86 , said it was a surprise to find so much water preserved under ground			0
he said : ' when you think about what 's down beneath your feet , it 's more exciting than just some rock			2
' until our most recent work , the hydrogen production in the continental crust was calculated to be negligible			0
' this was very wrong and our work shows the hydrogen production in the continental crust to be the equal to that produced in the oceanic crust			0
' this doubles the estimate of hydrogen produced on @entity2			0
' a new study has suggested that geological processes could have been responsible for helping to create much of the water on the @entity2 's surface			0
while some scientists believe water was first brought to our planet by icy comets from elsewhere int he solar system , researchers at @entity261 believe that the early @entity2 had entire oceans - worth of water trapped in its interior and these have been continually released to the surface by plate tectonics			1
they believe that the huge pressures on rocks deep inside the @entity2 's mantle are actually squeezing water out from the dry rock by forcing hydrogen and oxygen atoms trapped inside minerals there to combine			1
in laboratory experiments , professor @entity282 , an earth scientist at @entity261 , has been compressing minerals that are common in the @entity2 's mantel to subject them to high pressures and temperatures			0
in a paper they presented at the @entity201 fall meeting , they reported how recent tests of the mineral bridgmanite , the most abundant mineral in the lower mantel , does not contain enough hydrogen to play an important role in the @entity2 's water supply , but two other minerals called @entity301 and garnet may			0
' if all of the @entity2 's water is on the surface , that gives us one interpretation of the water cycle , where we can think of water cycling from oceans into the atmosphere and into the groundwater over millions of years , " said professor @entity282			1
' but if mantle circulation is also part of the water cycle , the total cycle time for our planet 's water has to be billions of years			2
' when we look into the origins of water on @entity2 , what we 're really asking is , why are we so different than all the other planets ? ' in this solar system , @entity2 is unique because we have liquid water on the surface			0
we 're also the only planet with active plate tectonics			0
' maybe this water in the mantle is key to plate tectonics , and that 's part of what makes @entity2 habitable			0

geologists estimate ancient rocks contain around 2.5 million cubic miles of water , more than all of the world 's rivers , swamps and lakes put together
isotope testing has shown the water is up to 2.7 billion years old in places
@entity152 and @entity352 researchers found ancient water bubbling up through fissures in the rock in 19 mines in @entity105 , @entity22 and @entity106
scientists say ancient water is viscous like maple syrup but tastes ' terrible '
