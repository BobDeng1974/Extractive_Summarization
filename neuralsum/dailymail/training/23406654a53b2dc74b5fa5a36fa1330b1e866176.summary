by @entity0 last updated at 12:21 pm on 19th september 2011 furious : @entity3 ' right leg was needlessly amputate , but the surgeon has still not apologised a surgeon who needlessly amputated a woman 's leg in a shocking hospital blunder has escaped punishment from the @entity10			1
@entity11 , an orthopaedic consultant at @entity12 , @entity13 , carried out an above knee amputation on @entity3 ' right leg in 2006 after diagnosing osteomyeltitis , a serious and potentially life - threatening bone infection			1
mrs @entity3 , from @entity17 , @entity18 , already had a below - the - knee amputation on the same leg in 1995 , partially as a result of her spina bifida			1
but , after the operation , subsequent tests - carried out at the insistence of the mother - of - three - found no evidence of the disease and mrs @entity3 was told : ' sorry there 's been a mistake			1
' she then sued the surgeon 's employer , the @entity32 , for medical negligence			0
at the turn of this year the health board paid out an undisclosed sum to mrs @entity3 in an out - of - court settlement and she received a formal apology from chief executive @entity40 for the error			1
however she failed to receive a personal apology from the consultant			0
in january , after the case was settled , she reported him to the @entity10			2
but last month , in a letter from its investigation officer , @entity48 , the @entity10 said it would be taking ' no further action ' against mr @entity11 , the @entity46 reported			2
the @entity10 case examiners accepted that there was ' no evidence of infection ' in the stump and that mr @entity11 had failed ' good medical practice ' in not referring for a second opinion			1
they also said the amputation was not ' justified ' and that his error could ' obviously be considered serious '			0
' having said that , this appears to be a single , isolated event and there is a possibility that the claimant may have undergone conversion to an above knee amputation due to subsequent neuropathic ulceration , ' they added			1
the case examiners went on to note that mr @entity11 had shown ' insight and remorse '			0
health chiefs at @entity12 hospital in @entity73 ( pictured ) apologised for a breach of their duty of care they considered issuing a ' warning ' but felt this would be a ' disproportionate response '			1
the finding has angered mrs @entity3			2
she told @entity81 : ' the letter says mr @entity11 has ' shown remorse ' but not to me			0
he has never apologised to me personally and as far as i can gather he still stands by his diagnosis			0
this is not even a rap around the knuckles			0
' she was also furious at the ' insensitive assumption ' that she may well have lost her leg anyway , as she says she cared for partially - amputated leg			0
before she lost the whole of her right leg she was mobile , could walk without the aid of a stick and push her grandchildren around in a pram			0
it was in 2005 that she began to experience pain and a rash in her ' stump ' and was told amputation was the solution to stop the infection spreading			0
' after the amputation i lost a lot of mobility and now need a stick to get around			0
i am now finding it difficult to play with my younger grandchildren the way i used to			0
' a spokesman for the @entity10 told the @entity114 that it did not comment on individual cases			1
mr @entity11 provided a written statement to the @entity10 through his representatives			2
it said : ' we would submit that this error of judgement is a single isolated incident and an unusual departure from mr @entity11 's practice			2
we note that the @entity10 's expert , mr @entity125 , acknowledges that there is a possibility that ' patient a ( mrs @entity3 ) ' would have had to have undergone an above knee amputation at some stage in the future			1
' a health board spokeswoman added : ' the @entity10 have , at the request of mrs @entity3 , investigated her complaint against mr @entity11 and found that there is no case to answer therefore the matter is closed			1
' a full investigation was carried out during the litigation process and an apology has been issued to mrs @entity3 by the chief executive of the health board			2

after op , tests found no evidence of disease and @entity3 told : ' sorry there 's been a mistake '
@entity10 says a warning to the *doctor* would be a ' disproportionate response ' to the ' isolated event '
