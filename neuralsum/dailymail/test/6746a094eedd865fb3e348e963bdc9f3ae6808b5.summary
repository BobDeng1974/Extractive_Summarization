‘ that 's my dream , to pull on that blue shirt , so hopefully it 'll come true			0
‘ in the @entity32 , strikers are about 23 or 24 if they 're playing week - in , week - out and at a club like @entity2 , you 've got the money to go out and buy a world class striker like @entity37			1
‘ and there 's also that pressure they need to win trophies , win the league			0
it 's just one of those things , you have to stick with it , be patient and hopefully the rewards will come			0

i ca n't put into words how much it meant to us , you saw the reaction of the staff after the game and after i went off and had to sit on the bench , it was the worst 10 or 15 minutes since i 've become a footballer			0
‘ in that game , it was awful , there 's nothing you can do on the sidelines and it makes you see what it 's like for managers			0
‘ you can see the work we put in week - in , week - out on the training ground , we do deserve to go up but i think a lot of teams think the same thing			0
@entity0 hopes to be part of @entity104 ’s @entity103 21 squad for the @entity106 ‘ it 's going to be tight , it 's going to be an exciting finish to be sure			2
