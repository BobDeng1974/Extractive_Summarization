a new species of @entity1 has been discovered thriving in @entity2 - after scientists were drawn to the creatures ' ' very odd ' chorus call			1
the newly - named @entity7 leopard frog was first noticed hopping around wetlands in the shadow of @entity10 in the @entity11			1
@entity12 , a scientist at @entity13 in @entity14 , was intrigued by the animals ' unusual chorus call			1
scroll down to hear the frogs ' call hip to the hoppa : a new species of frog has been discovered living in @entity2 after scientists noticed the animal 's unusual chorus call the frog looks identical to other leopard frogs but mr @entity12 felt certain it 's distinctive ' chuck ' call was like nothing he had heard before			1
so he teamed up with genetics experts , and tests proved him right - the frog was an entirely new species			1
the new frog has been given the latin name @entity35 in honour of @entity2 wildlife expert @entity37 , who first suggested there may be an unidentified species of frog in the area in 1937			2
sadly , mr @entity37 died in 1974 aged 63 before being able to prove his theory , as genetic testing technology was not available at the time			2
colonies of the frog have been discovered across @entity2 's five boroughs			0
it has since been found to inhabit a coastal strech from @entity49 in the north to @entity51 and @entity52 in the south mr @entity12 told @entity54 : ' @entity1 have very stereotyped calls within a species , so i knew this was different			2
' but it took me two years to find someone to partner with me on the genetics side			0
' this is only the third new species of frog to be discovered north of @entity65 since 1986 " what also makes this crazy is that it 's in a urban area - [ that 's ] what makes it a double whammy			0
" you would n't find it hopping around @entity75 " - ' [ these frogs ] probably require wetland areas of something on the average minimum of 10 acres or more			0
the frog has since been found to inhabit a coastal stretch from @entity49 in the north to @entity51 and @entity52 in the south			0
a large colony was discovered thriving on @entity85 .			0

@entity1 found hopping around wetlands in the shadow of the @entity10
