a wife has lost her £ 2million divorce battle with her property tycoon ex-husband - who is worth £ 38million – because she had signed a ' post-nuptial agreement '			2
a judge heard @entity6 and @entity7 , who had lived together near @entity8 , @entity9 , married more than three decades after starting an affair , but separated after less than three years			1
the @entity11 in @entity12 heard the couple , who separated in the summer of 2011 , had signed a ' post-nuptial ' agreement under which mrs @entity7 would receive two properties , £ 350,000 and a share of her ex-husband 's pension			1
but mrs @entity7 , 62 , complained that the agreement had been breached after she was put under ' undue pressure ' and exploited - and argued that she should be awarded a further £ 2million			1
a @entity11 ( pictured ) judge rejected @entity7 claim for £ 2million after she signed a ' post-nuptial ' agreement , which already entitled her to two properties , £ 350,000 and a share of her ex-husband 's pension deputy high court judge @entity28 , in a written ruling , said that he preferred mr @entity30 's evidence - and added mrs @entity7 had ' sought to underplay ' the agreement and had ' dramatised ' what happened			1
he rejected her claim of ' undue influence ' and cleared mr @entity30 of ' badgering and harassing ' her			1
mrs @entity7 had claimed her ex-husband was worth £ 54.3 million , although he put the figure at £ 38.4 million			1
she also accused her former husband of ' bullying ' her into signing up to the deal			2
mr @entity30 , 66 , described by lawyers as a multi-millionaire property developer , disputed her claim and offered another £ 200,000			0
she said that when she had questioned the fairness of the agreement , he had become ' uncontrollably angry ' , raising his fist and tightening her clothes around her neck			0
but mr @entity30 denied there was any such incident , but accepted there may have been ' some physical tension ' between them during an ' extremely fraught ' time as their marriage broke down			0
the court heard mr @entity30 and mrs @entity7 had written lists of ' how things could change ' to each other shortly before separating			1
mr @entity30 had written at the top of his list : ' i would like to be listened to ' but mrs @entity7 added ' listening ' third on her list			2
the couple , now in their 60s , met in the 1980s while both were married with young children			0
they had a child together after what was described as a ' clandestine affair ' , but only married in 2009			2
after moving in together in @entity8 in 2001 , they married after mr @entity30 had begged her to give him ' one last chance ' , the court heard			0
but just over a year after their wedding , mrs @entity7 went to see a divorce lawyer to seek advice about her entitlements – and the post-nuptial agreement was signed in august 2011			1
under the deal , mrs @entity7 got the family home - ' @entity81 ' , in @entity8 , which is valued at more than £ 530,000 as well as an investment property worth about £ 250,000			1
she also received a 50 % stake in her husband 's pension , worth more than £ 200,000			0
deputy high court judge @entity28 ( pictured ) said mrs @entity7 had ' sought to underplay ' the agreement however , mrs @entity7 had claimed liabilities , including legal costs bills , and said she would be left with less than £ 430,000 , before pensions			1
she sought £ 2million , claiming she would need every penny to meet her reasonable needs			0
but the judge ruled it would simply be ' unfair ' to mr @entity30 if his ex-wife was not held to the terms of the post-nup			0
he found mr @entity30 had done nothing which undermined her ability to ' form her own mind ' about the agreement and what it meant			0
mrs @entity7 , at the time , ' was rational , thoughtful , saddened by her situation , but certainly capable of independent thought '			2
' she knew her own mind and was keenly aware of her own objectives ' , the judge added			0
although mr @entity30 had ' confessed to bullying behaviour ' in some letters he wrote , judge @entity107 concluded : ' i reject the wife 's case that she was operating under any undue influence , duress or improper pressure when she entered into the post-nuptial settlement '			2
' i do not find it to be a dishonest document			0
i find that it was entered into freely by the wife , and with full appreciation of its implications			0
' she had received ' copious volumes of legal advice ' before signing her name on the dotted line			0
mrs @entity7 had never contended for more than a ' needs - based award ' following her divorce , and the judge said that was what the post-nup gave her			1
lamenting the titanic expense of the case , the judge said the pair had run up lawyers ' bills of more than £ 750,000 fighting over money			0
even after receiving the £ 200,000 lump sum , mrs @entity7 would still owe over £ 120,000 in legal costs			1
the cost of the case to mr @entity30 came to £ 638,097 - including the lump sum awarded to mrs @entity7 .			1

@entity6 and @entity7 married in 2009 after an affair in the 1980s
mrs @entity7 signed post-nup , entitling her to £ 350,000 and two properties
she claimed she had been bullied and badgered into signing the deal
but a judge rejected claims that she had been under ' undue influence '
