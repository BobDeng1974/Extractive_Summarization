by @entity0 published : 04:02 est , 10 march 2014 updated : 08:05 est , 11 march 2014 after years of being overweight , grandmother @entity2 , 53 , from @entity3 , was thrilled when she managed to shed 7st courtesy of a healthy diet and plenty of exercise			1
but despite spending hours in the gym trying to tone her upper arms , they remained stubbornly flabby			2
at her wits end , @entity2 decided to pay for surgery in @entity14 to remove the unsightly bingo wings - and was left devastated when she discovered that not only had the bungling surgeon failed to remove any flab ; he 'd left her arms badly scarred to boot			1
not right : @entity2 was horrified to discover that no fat had been removed following her Â £ 3,500 surgery now she has spoken out about her experience of surgery abroad and says she wishes she had never been tempted by the cut - price deals available			1
' i 'm really angry with the surgeon and i wish i had n't had the surgery , ' she admits			1
' i ca n't even bear to look at my arms - i feel like a freak ! ' @entity2 's story began when she decided to break the habit of a lifetime and embrace healthy eating in a bid to lose weight			1
originally tipping the scales at a hefty 16st , she slowly but surely managed to lose seven through diet and exercise and says she was thrilled with the results			0
' i felt great for it - i looked good as well , ' she reveals			0
' my clothes looked good on me and the only downside of it was the skin on my arms			2
' weighty problem : @entity2 once tipped the scales at 16st ( seen here ) but lost 7st by eating well and exercising ouch : she had surgery to remove pouches of skin left after weight loss but was upset to find them still there while the rest of her had become taut and toned , the skin on her arms had stretched and lost elasticity , leaving her with pouches of wobbly skin			1
'' i 'd always have to buy a size larger in jackets just so my arms could fit in , ' she remembers			0
' i wanted to feel feminine and i wanted to look feminine			0
' convinced that no amount of gym - going would fix the problem , she travelled to the @entity14 capital @entity70 for surgery to remove her bingo wings at a cost of Â £ 3,500			1
' it was a very , very nice clinic , ' she remembers			0
' the doctor told me what he was going to do and said he was used to working on women of colour so i felt really calm			0
' when she emerged from surgery , she was horrified by the results			0
' i had the scarring to prove that i 'd had this surgery but the actual size of my arms still looked the same , ' she reveals			2
' i was told by the surgeon that that was normal and i would n't see any difference for a few weeks			0
' relief : @entity2 has since had further surgery which saw medics remove a whopping 250g of fat from her arms four months later , she was still waiting to see results - much to the horror of @entity100 consultant plastic and reconstructive surgeon , @entity101			1
' she has had no recourse to further opinion and back - up on her trip to @entity14 and for me , that 's just unforgiveable , ' he says			2
' for a patient to be left adrift is just unacceptable			0
' dr @entity101 has since helped @entity2 put her botched body right , courtesy of a two - hour operation which involved removing 250g of fat - all of which should have already been removed by the bungling @entity14 doctor			1
speaking after the surgery , a thrilled @entity2 said it had helped her regain some of the confidence lost as a result of the botched surgery			1
' i can wear feminine clothes now and i can show my arms with pride , ' she adds			0
' they look really good and i feel really , really good			0
' @entity2 appears on @entity124 , thursday at 10pm on @entity125			2
