@entity0 was so determined to reach her target weight of 6st that she took 20 laxatives a day a young woman who suffered cruel taunts about her figure ended up necking 20 laxatives a day because she was so desperate lose weight			1
@entity0 was so fixated on dropping from 12st to 6st that she became embroiled in a cycle of binge eating , vomiting and laxative abuse			1
every night while her parents were asleep she would swallow the pills , bought from a local chemist , before spending most of the night on the loo - often falling asleep there			1
it was only when her tearful father begged her to get help that she reluctantly saw a doctor			2
appearing on @entity21 's @entity20 , miss @entity0 , now 22 , explained how her health declined dramatically within a year			1
at 17 , she had gone to her doctor about irregular periods and , as part of the consultation , was weighed			0
' i was told i was classed as obese , ' she told this morning presenters @entity29 and @entity30			0
' then i started getting comments from young lads , calling me a fat midget , and " look at her "			1
' while the process started gradually , ' within a year my whole life had ended up in this massive bubble of just me and this eating disorder , ' she said			2
' no one else understood what i was going through and no matter how much they said " you look fine " or " @entity43 , you are beautiful " , it was no good			0
' in my head , i had a goal weight - and that was what i was going to get to			1
' in her desperation to lose more and more weight , she resorted to a number of drastic measures - and by time she sought help , she was diagnosed with multiple eating disorders			1
' i was binge eating , vomiting and relying heavily on sugary drinks to keep me going , ' she said			1
courtesy of @entity21 's ' the morning ' ' and on top of that , i was always looking for more ways to lose weight - like laxatives			2
' a box of 60 costing £ 6 would last her for just three days , because she would down a staggering 20 at a time			2
in a bid to hide her addiction , she would take the pills late at night , just as her parents went to bed			2
then , as the explosive effects of the drugs kicked in , she would dash to the loo and spend most of the night there			2
' most of the time i fell asleep on the loo , ' she recalled			1
' i thought my parents did n't know , but looking back , ' they did			0
and with many people complaining even one or two laxatives can cause terrible stomach cramps and diarrhoea , what effect did 20 have on her body ? miss @entity0 told @entity20 hosts @entity29 and @entity30 : ' after taking the pills , i would be rocking backwards and forwards in agony ' teenage anorexics are being put at risk because supermarkets are handing over powerful laxatives without any restrictions or age controls , an investigation has found			1
laxative abuse can cause kidney failure concerns about the sale of the medicines to youngsters who are dangerously thin and ill were first raised by the eating disorder charity beat five years ago			1
however , an undercover survey recently revealed that leading supermarkets continue to dish out laxatives to 14 - year - olds without asking questions			0
beat is calling for a change in the law or voluntary measures by stores to ban laxative sales to under - 16s			1
the group also wants the maximum pack size reduced to ten tablets with sales restricted to pharmacies and a warning label that reads : ‘ this is not a weight loss product ’			1
the charity ’s chief executive , @entity120 , said there is evidence that an increasing number of youngsters are using laxatives as part of their drastic weight loss regimes			1
she said : ‘ we have seen a 30 per cent increase in calls to our helplines over the last year where people have mentioned overusing laxatives in unhealthy way			2
and that does include a significant number of young people as well			1
’ miss @entity0 said : ' i would be rocking backwards and forwards in agony			1
' fifteen hours of labour was nothing compared to being on that toilet every night , ' she said			0
asked why , if the pain was so bad , she continued , she replied : ' it was in my head that i was fat and i wanted to lose loads of weight			1
' if i could n't get it out of one end , by being sick , i would get it out the other			0
' medical experts warn that laxative abuse can cause diarrhoea , dehydration and electrolyte imbalances that can lead to kidney failure			1
it can also damage the liver and potentially damage the heart leading to heart failure and death			0
miss @entity0 's constant exhaustion and trips to the loo began to sound alarm bells with her worried family			1
then , when her hair began falling out in clumps due to malnutrition , her parents confronted her			2
and their reaction was what shocked miss @entity0 , from @entity177 , into taking action			2
she told @entity29 and @entity30 : ' i have never seen my dad cry , but he was nearly in tears			0
' he said : " we 've lost you			0
you 're not my little girl any more "			0
' he could usually get me to talk , but this time i had shut everyone out			0
' in the end , my mum begged me to get some help			2
' she was prescribed antidepressants by her gp and slowly began to eat selected foods			0
today , thanks to specialist treatment , she has returned to a healthy weight and gone onto have a baby daughter			1
her little girl has also given her more important things to focus on , she said			0
' i do n't have the energy to sit on the loo all night , ' she explained			0
and she urged others not to fall into the terrible weight loss trap that she did			0
' do n't do it			0
once you have an eating disorder you can never look at food in the way again			0
' i ca n't look at a burger in the same way and i ca n't just sit on the couch and have a lazy day			0
' it 's a mental disorder and it ruins your body			0
thankfully , i see myself a lot differently now			0
