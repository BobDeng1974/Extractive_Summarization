@entity1 police have issued a warning over reckless motorists using autopilot systems to let cars drive on their own following a new , worrying trend			1
the warning came after a shocking video showing a ' driver ' sitting in the backseat of his car while driving at 40mph as his terrified girlfriend screams from the passenger seat			1
the @entity14 in the footage is fitted with dozens of sensors which read the road ahead to adjust the steering , speed and brakes			1
speaking in @entity1 , the man is heard telling his girlfriend not to worry , and boasting that the car can drive itself			1
a fizzy drink bottle can be seen tied to the steering wheel as the car travels along the road at 40mph			1
the woman can be heard yelling at her boyfriend to stop the car but he tells her it is ok , adding : ' the option works			1
stop yelling , stop yelling			0
the car drives itself , trust me			2
' the young woman replies : ' no , do n't leave it , are you nuts ? ' he then says : ' we wo n't die , it works			1
i trust my car '			0
@entity1 police issued a warning over the autopilot after a number of videos of drivers using the system dangerously appeared online police believe the incident was filmed on @entity74 , a stretch of motorway between @entity77 and the @entity79 city of @entity80			1
the people involved are yet to be identified and police are still investigating , but the footage is from just one of a number of similar videos in which people post about fooling the autopilot system			1
comments on the video were mixed , with one person saying : ' real funny until somebody gets killed			0
' however another viewer wrote : ' the car 's electronic [ system ] does everything for you and you can relax by pushing the driver 's seat backwards , into a comfortable couch position			1
the car brakes , speeds up , holds distance - all on it 's own			2
above 60 km / h ( 40mph ) you have to take over the command again			0
' the ‘ @entity108 ’ package on the 2014 s - class sedan has integrated sensors , controls and 36 separate technologies			0
while the technology is cutting edge , it is n't yet good enough to provide completely autonomous driving , despite attempts to hack the system			2
the system ’s most notable feature , which has been in development for 15 years , is something called ‘ traffic - jam ’ assist			0
this allows the car to steer , brake and accelerate itself at speeds lower than 37 mph ( 60 km / h )			0
a ‘ @entity135 suspension system ’ uses two cameras in the windshield to spot imperfections in the road , such as bumps , potholes			0
the suspension is then changed before the wheels hit bumpy surface			0
‘ @entity144 cruise control ’ , meanwhile , is a radar - based feature which maintains a safe distance from the vehicle in front by braking when necessary and accelerating again when possible			0
a feature called ‘ pre-safe braking ’ works up to 31 mph ( 50 km / h ) whether or not the driver steps on the brake			2
according to @entity14 , it can ' partially mitigate ' accidents up to 45 mph ( 72 km / h )			2
the features are made possible using 12 ultrasonic and six radar sensors , alongside eight cameras that monitor every angle around the car			2
a control unit collects data from the sensors and the camera and then uses algorithms to provide commands to the car – all in just a 10th of a second			2
the car also has technology to help prevent collisions by recognising pedestrians , as well as keeping in the lane and distance control with the car ahead			0
more common features include parking assistance and rear - crash monitoring			0
there is also an updated attention - assist feature that checks to see when the driver is tired			0
it is linked to the car 's navigation system , can even tell the driver where coffee and fuel can be found			1
radar position in the back of the car can detect whether a vehicle is approaching too fast			1
if this happens , rear signal lights are flashed to catch the attention of the approaching car			0
if the driver does n't react , the car automatically closes all its windows and adjusts seats upright			1
however , the most controversial feature is a sensor to make sure the driver keeps his hands on the wheel			1
it appears that the sensor is easily fooled when any other object such as a bottle of drink is hung there instead .			0

reckless driver seen using autopilot to drive @entity14 from the back seat
sensors on @entity14 car can adjust the steering , speed and brakes on car
the system only works when drivers ' hands are on the steering wheel
but motorists have fooled the vehicle by putting bottles on wheel instead

his girlfriend screams in terror as he assures her that ' we wo n't die '
