@entity39 , writing to this newspaper under her maiden name of @entity38 , takes issue with mr @entity19 for speaking of the impact on society of population growth driven by immigration , and the fact that @entity5 @entity46 have larger families than @entity5 @entity48			1
‘ most of these newcomers are either students or migrants with skills @entity5 needs , ’ she writes			1
