playing with a toy car 's remote control in his doting brother 's arms , it is hard to believe that just weeks ago brain tumour patient @entity7 was being treated in intensive care			0
though bearing a faint scar on the back of his head from his brain surgery , the five - year - old was almost unrecognisable as the desperately ill child seen being wheeled into hospital on a stretcher in early september			1
the little boy finished a course of pioneering proton bean therapy last month , and last week was seen with his family in @entity21 , @entity22 , as he continues his recovery			2
he looked intently at the remote as he was carried by older brother @entity29 ; his mother @entity39 , 45 , and father @entity40 , 51 , not far away as they pushed his younger sister in a buggy			0
in august , @entity7 was at the centre of an international manhunt after his parents took him out of @entity46 because they believed @entity48 treatment would have left him deaf , blind and brain damaged			1
on the mend : the little boy finished a course of pioneering proton bean therapy last month , and last week was seen with his family in @entity21 , @entity22 , as he continues his recovery at play : @entity7 , pictured with his younger sister , plays with the toy car in the back of the family 's car they were traced to @entity22 where , at the request of the @entity63 authorities , they were put in prison and the five - year - old was held in hospital under armed guard with no family members allowed to see him			1
the @entity69 had planned to sell a holiday home in southern @entity22 to fund the pioneering treatment which they desperately wanted their son to have , but which was refused by the @entity48 in @entity74			1
however , after a dramatic u-turn in events , they were eventually released from prison without charge and were able to continue their journey to @entity34 to the @entity81 which had agreed to treat @entity7			0
family : @entity7 's mother @entity84 ( centre ) , and father @entity40 ( right ) pushing his younger sister in a buggy worry : his parents have said it was unlikely the family would return to @entity63 because they do not feel ' safe ' enough , and instead took @entity7 back to @entity22 for further treatment @entity74 later reversed its decision and confirmed it had decided to pay for the treatment abroad			1
after six weeks at the hospital , during which he received 30 rounds of the treatment his parents hope will be life - saving , @entity7 left @entity34 at the end of october			1
however , his parents said it was unlikely the family would return to @entity63 because they do not feel ' safe ' enough			2
instead , they planned to continue @entity7 's treatment in @entity22			2
speaking after @entity7 left hospital in @entity34 , mr @entity7 told @entity103 : ' after some time we decided that perhaps it was best to return to @entity22			1
desperate : @entity106 as he arrived in @entity34 for his pioneering treatment			2
he arrived at the hospital by ambulance and was wheeled in on a bed recovery : after taking his first tentative steps , @entity7 was wheeled out of the centre in @entity34 ahead of his family 's move to @entity22			1
the youngster has spent six weeks receiving pioneering proton therapy treatment last treatment : @entity40 and @entity119 with @entity7 , prior to his final round of proton beam therapy treatment we have a property there so life can be established quite easily for us			1
' at the moment we do n't feel 100 per cent safe , i suppose you would call it , contemplating being in @entity74 until perhaps they do this investigation into how everything was conducted for us			0
' once that has been established then we can think about going back to @entity74			0
but for the time being we have been in contact with a doctor in @entity22 so we are continuing with ( @entity7 's ) treatment in @entity22 instead of @entity74			0
' happy : @entity7 was filmed on an outing to the park in a touching family video posted online by his brother medics who had been treating @entity7 in @entity34 said that having arrived at the hospital on a bed by ambulance , by the time he left he was able to sit on his own , and play with toys			0
the specialist treatment is a more targeted way of destroying cancerous cells than conventional radiation using photon beams , but @entity48 guidance does not recommend it as the best form of treatment			0
during @entity7 's 30 visits to the centre he had 13 treatments focusing on the brain and spine to ensure the tumour he had removed had not spread , and the remaining 17 to irradiate where the brain tumour once was			0
he previously had major surgery to remove the brain tumour on july 24 and a further operation on his brain on august 22			0
brotherly love : @entity7 pictured on a family trip to a pizza restaurant with his older brother @entity29 poignant : @entity7 pictured clutching his favourite toy ahead of another round of specialist treatment in @entity34			2
