by @entity0 if it sounds too good to be true , it probably is			0
but such sound advice escaped many people who were captivated by the idea that a machine could really turn water into wine in just three days			1
turns out , such ideas are best left to the pages of @entity10 when @entity11 managed to do it with just the wave of his hand			0
the miracle machine was a fake			0
however , the publicity stunt was for a good cause			1
an organization called @entity20 says it provides people around the world with access to clean water			1
' @entity47 has generated enormous interest around the globe			1
we and supporters @entity33 and @entity34 are sorry to disappoint anyone who was looking forward to high quality wine in 3 days			1
' ' for the cost of a bottle of fine wine , we provide a way to produce 99.9 % pure drinking water to a family for up to five years and @entity61 is the true miracle , ' charity founder @entity54 said			1
if the aim was to generate interest for the organization , the trick worked as the phony miracle wine maker generated some 6,000 tweets with 7,000 people signing up to learn more about what would have been a revolutionary invention			1
' one in eight people on the planet do n't have the simple miracle of drinking clean water , ' said @entity76 , ceo of @entity20			1
' if we save one life because of the campaign , it has been worth it			0
' elaborate hoax : the creators of the hoax came up with a complex process as to how the machine would work the organization did their level best to make the item appear genuine stating that it was developed by wine experts in @entity91 and capable of make different types and styles of wine , including @entity95 and @entity96			2
potential users were told that they could track the progress of their wine using a free smartphone app. the rest of us should have known that the people behind the fictional object were trying to blind the rest of the world with science			1
their nonsensical description of how the machine operates is now comical when read in hindsight			0
' a digital ‘ refractometer measures the sugar content of the liquid during the fermentation process , while an air - diffuser passes filtered air through a so - called ‘ micro-oxygenated ’ channel			0
miracle worker : @entity54 ( center ) is the founder and international president of @entity20			2
in 2003 @entity54 was living in @entity121 , @entity122 installing water systems for victims of the government supported genocide			2
he is flanked by pr agents @entity33 and @entity34 convincing : thousands of people were duped along with several media outlets that the machine was genuine the machine also has an ultrasonic transducer under the chamber that can speed up the flavor and development of the wine			2
just like the miracle from biblical times , it literally turns water into wine , with just the addition of a few ingredients in a fraction of the time and cost it would normally take , ‘ explained the ' ceo ' @entity33			2
the campaign was thought up by public relations group @entity149			0
@entity33 and @entity34 , both of @entity151 , said they knowingly put their reputations on the line to raise awareness for a cause they support			0
' i would do it 100 times over again , ' @entity33 told the @entity159			0
' not the misleading and purposely being facetious , but if it saves one extra life , i 'd do it again			0
' ' almost two million children die each year from contaminated water and poor sanitation , ' @entity34			0
' the miracle of turning water to wine might remain out of reach , but wine to @entity20 has shown that the real miracle of providing clean water is easily within our grasp			1

the ' inventors ' of @entity47 spoke of turning water into wine in just three days
it was actually a publicity stunt to draw attention to @entity20 , a *nonprofit* that provides people with clean drinking water
