for decades , experts thought that an extinct group of mammals known as anthracobunidae were related to the ancestors of modern elephants and sea cows			1
but fossils believed to belong to a large land mammal that lived 48 million years ago , have led to experts disputing this theory			0
the discovery of bones from the ancient creature has led scientists to identify a new branch of mammals closely related to modern horses , rhinos and tapirs			1
two jaws and other bones ( pictured ) have led scientists to identify a new branch of mammals closely related to modern horses , rhinos and tapirs - known as anthracobunidae - that lived in @entity23 and @entity24 about 48 million years ago the mammals , known as anthracobunidae , lived in @entity23 and @entity24 and , until now , were commonly considered to be the ancestors of modern elephants and manatees			1
but this idea had puzzled experts from a geographical point of view , as elephants and their relatives are groups that are known to originate from @entity34 , not @entity35			0
the new fossils indicate that anthracobunids are in fact related to the tiny tapirs that originated in @entity35			2
the mammals , known as anthracobunidae , lived in @entity23 and @entity24 and , until now , were commonly considered to be the ancestors of modern elephants and manatees			1
this image shows one of the jaw bones that led to this theory being thrown out scientists have now identifed a new branch of mammals closely related to modern horses ( pictuerd left ) rhinos and tapirs ( pictured right )			1
the new fossils indicate that anthracobunids are in fact related to the tiny tapirs that originated in @entity35 anthracobunidae are an extinct group of mammals			2
they lived some 48 million years ago in what is now @entity23 and @entity24			0
for decades , scientists thought they were related to the ancestors of modern elephants and sea cows			1
now experts say they are closely related to modern horses , rhinos and tapirs			2
this makes more sense because elephants and their relatives are groups that are known to originate from @entity34 , not @entity35			2
however , the smaller tapir is known to have originated in @entity35			0
researchers analysed isotopes and the shape of the bones to find that these animals most likely fed on land and were large and lumbering			0
they did however spend a considerable amount of time near water , in a similar way to modern rhinos and tapirs , according to the study , which was published in the journal @entity86			0
dr @entity87 , of @entity88 , who led the study , said : ‘ @entity90 are just one of many lineages of vertebrates that evolved from terrestrial animals , but then left to live in a shallow water habitat and had thick bones			0
‘ these thick bones probably acted like ballast to counteract body buoyancy			0
you can see that kind of bone structure in modern hippos , otters , penguins , and cormorants			0
’ co-author @entity106 , of @entity107 in @entity108 , said : ‘ the evidence that has been accumulating from fossils and genes strongly suggests that the ancestor of elephants and sea cows lived in @entity34 , and at a time when that continent was totally isolated , so anthracobunids ’ @entity35 distribution was hard to explain			1
’ the previous theory that anthracobunidae were related to elephants had puzzled scientists because elephants and their relatives are groups that are known to originate from @entity34 , not @entity35			1

scientists from @entity88 @entity107 in @entity108 came up with the new theory
it gives anthracobunidae new *descendants* - elephants , horses and tapirs
their theory makes sense because the ancient creatures lived in @entity35 , where tapirs are believed to have originated from
experts previously thought that anthracobunidae were related to the ancestors of modern elephants and sea cows , *including* manatees
