' we had no money when we got there , and we struggled to , you know , piece together the resources for mortgages , for houses , for @entity88 's education			0
' ' you know , it was not easy			0
' @entity1 was swiftly attacked as ' out of touch ' after the comment , and on tuesday morning she explained that she and @entity0 had racked up ' something like $ 12 million ' in legal fees by the end of @entity0 's presidency			1
' @entity0 and i were obviously blessed			0
we worked hard for everything we got in our lives and we have continued to work hard			0
and we 've been blessed in the last 14 years , ' @entity28 told @entity102 host @entity101			0
the financial ' struggles ' the @entity104 faced at the end of @entity0 's second term more than a decade ago are but a distant memory , however			2
in the first year @entity0 was out of office , the @entity28 's made $ 12.3 million			1
in 2004 @entity0 locked down an unheard of $ 15 million advance for his autobiography @entity112 , and , as of last year , he had made $ 106 million off of speeches			1
his net worth as of last february was $ 55 million , and he has continued to make money off of speeches since			2
@entity1 has made roughly $ 5 million in speeches since leaving the @entity116 last year , and she had made more than $ 16 million in advances for her two memoirs , in living history , 2003 , and @entity120 , 2014			1

together , the couple has a net worth of $ 100 million or more			1
all former presidents receive an annual pension based on how much they were paid while in office			0
no other modern president has made quite the killing that @entity0 has off of speeches and books , however			0
@entity71 , who also left the @entity3 broke , has made millions off of the 14 books he has written			0
but as of 2012 his net worth was only $ 7 million , according to 24/7 @entity136 , and he has done nothing since that would have increased it dramatically enough to rival the value of @entity140 's assets , @entity28 is the richest of the five living @entity10 presidents			1
from left to right they are , president @entity75 , former president @entity74 , former president @entity28 and former president @entity73			2
they are pictured here at the opening ceremony of the @entity146 april 25 , 2013 in @entity147 , @entity148 likewise , @entity74 's estimated net worth is less than half of @entity28 's			1
in 2012 he was valued at $ 20 million after having made $ 7 million off his 2010 book decision points and $ 15 million in speeches			0
his father , former president @entity73 has a net worth of $ 23 million , but much of that comes from the value of his home and a 100 + acre estate he owns in @entity159			1
in his hey day , @entity73 would charge anywhere from $ 60,000 - $ 80,000			0
in 1993 @entity73 charged a record - breaking $ 100,00 for a speech			0
@entity28 has since topped that with a $ 750,000 speech			0
president @entity75 has the lowest net worth of all the living presidents , coming in at $ 5 million			1
most of that money can be attributed to the royalties he received on the two books he wrote before becoming president , the 1995 hit dreams from may father and his 2006 book @entity168			0
in terms of the richest presidents ever , @entity28 ranks in the top 10			2
the wealthiest @entity10 president in history , according to 24/7 @entity136 , was @entity66 , who left behind $ 1 billion in shared assets with other members of the @entity66 family			2
his wife , @entity182 , was also very wealthy , and upon her death in 1996 , her estate was valued at $ 43.7 million .			0

@entity1 was asked by @entity13 's @entity12 in an interview that aired on monday night why she and her husband , former president @entity28 , were charging *organizations* outrageous fees to have them speak
@entity1 told her it was because they were ' dead broke ' and in debt when they left the @entity3
but the @entity104 have n't been in debt for many years , according to financial disclosure statements
in their first year out of the @entity3 they made $ 12.3 million
their overall net worth is approximately $ 100 million
@entity0 is one of the 10 richest presidents in @entity10 history
