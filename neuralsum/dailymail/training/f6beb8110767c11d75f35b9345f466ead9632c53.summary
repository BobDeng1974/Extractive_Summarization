cabinet secretary sir @entity0 has @entity1 ‘ by the balls ’ , with the prime minister having to ask his permission before doing anything , according to a former @entity7 adviser			1
@entity8 , @entity9 ’s key aide when he was @entity10 , claimed that mr @entity1 is surrounded by a chaotic team and ‘ can not manage his way out of a paper bag ’			1
in a scathing attack , mr @entity8 said : ‘ everyone knows that @entity0 is in charge of everything			1
sir @entity0 ( pictured left ) has @entity1 ' by the balls ' , claims a former aide of @entity9 ‘ @entity0 is more important than anyone in the @entity22 apart from @entity1 or @entity23 – and is arguably more important than @entity23			1
‘ he sits right next to the prime minister , has him completely by the balls and @entity1 does n’t do anything without @entity0 ’s permission			1
’ sir @entity0 , @entity29 ’s most senior civil servant , was @entity30 ’s principal private secretary from 1999 to 2003			1
he was nicknamed sir cover - up after preventing the @entity34 inquiry from seeing letters and records of phone calls between mr @entity30 and @entity38 in the run - up to the war			2
@entity8 pictured behind @entity9 was a key aide when he was @entity10 his influence is such that mr @entity1 is said to have once joked : ‘ remind me , @entity0 , do you work for me or do i work for you ? ’ mr @entity8 was also highly critical of mr @entity1 ’s closest aides , calling them ‘ totally and utterly useless ’			1
speaking at an event organised by the @entity48 think - tank , he said : ‘ i do n’t think in lots of ways it matters what happens in the election			0
whether it is @entity1 or @entity55 who gets in , neither of them know how to prioritise , neither can build a serious team , they ’re both surrounded by these dysfunctional teams			2
‘ they do n’t know how to get anything done , neither has had experience in any organisation watching someone who knows how to get things done in a real alpha organisation that ’s well managed			0
’ mr @entity8 , who describes himself as now ‘ very happily unemployed ’ , was mr @entity9 ’s special adviser but left in january after resigning			1
he said mr @entity1 ’s advisers at @entity70 ‘ operate in a bubble in which it is at most ten days planning or more usually 48 hours or 72 hours ’			2
he added : ‘ there is no long - term priority			0
there is no long - term plan			0
the central people operate in that kind of culture , they do n’t think anything can change			0
they just think that is politics			0
‘ his most important advisers are [ chief of staff ] @entity84 and [ director of communications ] @entity87 – both of them are totally and utterly useless			0
it is not their fault			0
they are just in the wrong job			0
the fault lies in @entity1 putting them there			2
‘ if you have a prime minister who has no sense of priorities and can not manage his way out of a paper bag , and his two chief advisers who do n’t know what they are doing … of course it ’s going to be a farce			2
