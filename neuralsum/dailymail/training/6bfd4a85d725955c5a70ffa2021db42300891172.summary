watching @entity1 's mesmerising display last weekend got me thinking : where does the @entity4 winger stand among the great foreign players who have graced our game ? we have been blessed since the inception of the @entity10 to see a number of players arrive here and produce performances that have ensured their names will stand the test of time , but could you make a team out of them ? so , as it is international week , i 've decided to do something different and name what i consider to be the best foreign xi of the modern era			1
it has n't been easy and some big reputations have had to miss the cut			0
see whether you agree with this ... @entity32 columnist @entity31 ( left ) came up against many of the @entity10 's best foreign players , including @entity36 's @entity35 ( pictured wrestling for possession at @entity39 in november 2010 ) goalkeeper : @entity41 when people talk about players who made @entity44 so successful , he would be competing for one of the top slots			1
his influence in those initial title triumphs was just as big as @entity49 's			1
even towards the end of his career , when he was playing for @entity4 , he was making extraordinary saves and one performance at @entity39 in may 2003 lives in my memory			2
former @entity56 international @entity41 , pictured making a save for @entity44 against @entity58 , enjoyed a successful eight - year spell with @entity44 @entity41 also went on to play for @entity10 sides @entity60 and @entity4 right - back : @entity62 admired throughout the @entity10 , he is a top player and what i like most about him is that he just gets on with his job without any fuss , putting the team first			1
covers miles going up and down the pitch and has the honours his quality deserves			0
he only cost £ 6million and could end up being regarded as one of @entity4 's greatest signings			1
@entity75 defender @entity62 ( left ) , pictured sliding to block a shot from @entity60 's @entity77 , has been instrumental in @entity4 's rise to the top from the right - hand side of the back four @entity62 , who cost a bargain £ 6million from @entity82 in 2008 , could become one of @entity4 's greatest players centre - half : @entity86 the biggest compliment i can pay the @entity89 is that if he maintains his standards for the next four or five years — and @entity4 are successful at home and abroad — he could outstrip @entity92 as the @entity10 's greatest defender			1
he has the elegance of @entity95 and the steel of @entity97			2
speaking of him … @entity4 captain @entity86 lifts the 2013 - 14 @entity10 trophy after another fine season @entity86 could be regarded as the @entity10 's best - ever defender if he continues his form for @entity4 centre - half : @entity97 my type of defender			1
@entity106 tried to buy him in january 2006 but our loss was @entity44 's gain			1
i 'd have loved to have played alongside him and i 'm sure we could have formed a solid partnership			0
he loves defending and putting his head in where it hurts			0
his arrival took @entity95 's performances up another level			2
they became the best defensive pairing in @entity122			0
@entity97 waves goodbye to the @entity124 faithful after calling time on his @entity44 career @entity31 admits he would have loved to have played alongside @entity97 in the centre of defence left - back : @entity130 when he was at his peak , all you could do was toss a coin to decide whether it was him or @entity135 who you selected for the @entity137 team of the year			1
a tough , tenacious defender who also scored a number of vital goals			0
he was n't the tallest but always provided a threat at set pieces			0
@entity130 , pictured celebrating a goal against @entity144 in 2012 , was a big presence at @entity44 the @entity146 ended his time at @entity124 with a summer move to @entity150 giants @entity149 right - midfield : @entity151 what more can you say about the man who is currently the best player in the world ? you could see he was going to reach that level with his pace and power			1
for some reason , he never excelled against @entity106 — he only scored two goals — but he was the reason @entity44 wrestled the initiative back off @entity36 and became @entity163 's dominant team			2
@entity164 star @entity151 , pictured shooting against @entity4 in 2009 , was sold to @entity166 for £ 80million after becoming one of the world 's best players during his time in the @entity10 @entity151 helped @entity44 overcome @entity36 's dominance under @entity172 and get back to the top centre - midfield : @entity175 a monster , his partnership with @entity178 was as good as anything we have seen			1
his performance against @entity106 in the 2001 fa cup final stands out			0
he was magnificent and did n't deserve to be on the losing side			0
in the dressing room afterwards , everyone kept saying : ' how good was @entity175 ? ' @entity186 still talks about that game as @entity175 made him realise he had to climb a few more levels to reach the top			2
it says everything that clubs , when they sign young midfielders , hope they turn into ' the next @entity175 '			2
@entity146 @entity175 ( centre ) , pictured in action against @entity106 's @entity197 ( left ) and @entity198 at @entity199 in 2004 , was the driving force in @entity202 's midfield for a number of years @entity175 inspired @entity106 midfielder @entity186 to raise his game after his display in the 2001 @entity207 final centre - midfield : @entity209 his stamp is all over @entity4 's recent trophy - winning exploits and he has always come up with a goal when it matters , be it in a decisive @entity10 match , the @entity207 final or the @entity217 final			1
a powerhouse but blessed with great skill			0
impossible to contain when he builds up a head of steam			0
@entity4 's @entity224 midfielder @entity209 , pictured in action against @entity60 in the @entity226 last weekend , has helped his club to two @entity10 titles in the last three seasons @entity209 has proved a huge success at the @entity231 since his £ 25million move from @entity233 in 2010 left - midfield : @entity1 i have to include him , as he is a joy to watch			1
his form has been so good that @entity4 fans are debating whether he can become the club 's greatest - ever player			2
@entity240 , @entity241 , @entity242 or even @entity243 could have filled this role but @entity1 is so easy on the eye			2
could score more goals but makes up for that with his assists and the way he controls a game			0
@entity252 @entity1 shone as champions @entity4 beat @entity60 2 - 0 away from home last saturday @entity1 is the main creative force in @entity4 's midfield , often laying on chances for @entity258 and @entity259 striker : @entity261 i 've used this analogy before and i make no apology for using it again			1
when he hit top gear and ran past you , it was like trying to chase after someone on a motorbike			0
when @entity202 were ' @entity271 ' in the period between 2003 - 2004 , @entity261 rivalled @entity273 as the best in the world			0
a great goal - scorer , not to mention a scorer of great goals , he is the finest player i have seen in the @entity10			0
his game did n't have a weakness			0
now for the hard bit ... @entity202 legend @entity261 celebrates a vital equaliser against rivals @entity58 at @entity199 in april 2006 @entity284 helped transform @entity261 from a wide player to one of the deadliest strikers in the world striker : @entity35 there were no shortage of contenders for this role , ranging from @entity49 , @entity294 and @entity295 to @entity296 and @entity258			1
but even though they were all better players , i kept going back to @entity35 because he did what all strikers should do and that is score in the biggest games			2
he scored three winners in the @entity207 final , got the crucial goals in two @entity217 finals and who could forget what he did in @entity310 in the @entity312 final ? at his best , he was unplayable			0
so there you have it ! @entity36 's @entity35 ( left ) , pictured scoring against @entity44 away at @entity124 in 2010 , had a tendency to find the back of the net in the biggest games for various managers at @entity322 @entity35 returned to @entity36 on a one - year deal in the summer after two years away from the club			1

@entity1 's *dazzling* display against @entity60 helped *confirm* his place as one of the @entity10 's best foreign players
@entity44 benefited from @entity41 's outstanding performances between 1991 and 1999
@entity86 and @entity62 have been key to @entity4 winning two titles in three seasons
@entity44 are feeling the loss of @entity97 and @entity130 , who both left @entity124 in the summer
@entity151 , @entity175 and @entity209 complete the midfield
@entity35 beats @entity296 and @entity49 to partner @entity261
