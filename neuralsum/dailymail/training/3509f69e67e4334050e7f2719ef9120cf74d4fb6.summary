the rat infestation in @entity3 's new 1 @entity2 office is getting worse			1
pests are now ' taking over ' the newly - developed @entity7 premises and @entity8 no longer wants to step foot inside at all , reports claim			2
this week , after rat droppings were allegedly found on an editor 's computer keyboard , staff of all @entity15 's titles were issued with a new rule : no eating at your desk			1
' they ate through his rug to fit under his door			0
' after numerous failed extermination attempts , the city 's health authority has now been notified			0
the setback means staff are unlikely to see the eponymous magazine editor in the building until well into the new year			0
that 's one famous mover : the @entity48 feed for the @entity15 owned publication showed rapper @entity50 carrying boxes for them day in the life : the publication was tongue in cheek about the moving process according to @entity57 , @entity8 , 65 , has allegedly informed her staffers that the vermin must be removed before she sets foot in their new home			1
the staff member told @entity57 the most pressing dilemma facing them had to do with fashion : ' a serious concern ( laughable but i guess it makes sense ) is all the clothing that could get nibbled through			2
' the timing of the infestation comes after @entity3 created an online campaign advertising their move to the new offices : ' @entity76 the hatches , lower @entity77 , because we 're coming for you			1
' the @entity48 feed for the @entity15 owned publication showed rapper @entity50 carrying boxes for them .			0
