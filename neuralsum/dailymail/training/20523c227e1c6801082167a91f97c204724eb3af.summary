and @entity4 women are certainly living by that mantra when it comes to their height			1
we may be some of the shortest ladies in @entity6 , but we 're compensating by wearing the highest heels on the continent , according to a new study			1
following in the footsteps ( literally ) of stiletto - mad celebrities such as @entity21 and @entity22 , @entity4 women are now tottering around on an average heel height of 3.3 inches			1
that 's almost one whole inch more than the petite women of @entity27 who , favouring a heel of 2.4 inches , wear only the fifth highest shoe in @entity6			1
hot on the heels of the @entity31 , preferring an average height of 3.2 inches , are the women of @entity34 , while @entity35 wear 3 inches and the @entity36 2.7 inches			2
the study comes as @entity4 women are revealed to now be among the shortest in @entity6 , with the average 18 - to 29 - year - old measuring in at 5ft 4ins ( 163cm )			1
our @entity36 counterparts are tower over us by five centimetres , at 5ft 6ins , while the @entity34 are just one centimetre taller than us			0
the heel brigade : @entity21 , left , and @entity22 , right , are just two celebrities rarely seen in anything less than a three - inch heel perhaps in a bid to tower over continental counterparts , a quarter of @entity4 women brave stilettos of between four and six inches high			1
and even though @entity21 has admitted to suffering from bunions because of her dedication to the high - heeled cause , three per cent of @entity4 ladies still admit to preferring heels loftier than than six inches			1
the average @entity4 woman is also suffering according to the survey , with 65 per cent saying they have experienced significant pain because of their shoes			2
it seems we are prepared go through it because , according to psychologists , appearing taller makes us seem more confident , successful and even intelligent			2
psychologist , @entity63 said : ' a tall woman is considered more assertive , confident , richer , capable , successful , independent and even more intelligent than those who are shorter			2
' perception is incredibly powerful and it makes sense that the feedback we receive from the way we are treated by others will reinforce our choices			0
' @entity4 women are ambitious and if putting on a pair of six inch heels increases their career prospects the savvy individual will do so			1

they were followed by @entity84 in 3.37 inches , the @entity85 at 3.35 inches , @entity86 at 3.28 inches and the women of east @entity88 in heels of 3.25 inches			1
as many as 65 per cent of @entity4 women say they have suffered a significant amount of pain as a result of their choice of footwear , but a staggering half of these were prepared to endure the agony , which is compared to toothache and earache			2
size matters : we may be among the shortest women in @entity6 but we are trying our best to walk tall by wearing heels of , on average , 3.3 inches @entity104 , from @entity105 , said she was prepared to suffer in order to look good			2
the 35 - year - old office clerk added : ' heels make me feel more confident and attractive , and i feel the higher they are , the better			0
' it does mean my feet are suffering a bit but i ’m prepared to go through it			0
” the study of 3,792 women , conducted by foot care brand @entity116 , also found the shorter the person , the higher the heel			0

however , wearing fashionable shoes occasionally is fine			0
' there are plenty of easy foot care treatments available that can help treat feet at home and avoid a trip to the podiatrist ’s clinic			0
' with healthy feet , a woman can stand as tall as she wants in the highest of heels			0
