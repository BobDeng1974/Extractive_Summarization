women employees at the @entity9 free school were ordered not just to wear the hijab – scarf – to cover their head , but to cover the entire body and not wear symbols of other faiths			1
the 50 - year - old teacher has revealed the full list of rules she was made to adhere to , condemning the school for being ‘ more concerned about dress codes and not putting the children ’s education first ’			1
the @entity24 school drew criticism last week for its policy of sitting girls at the back of classrooms			1
former teachers say reading fairy tales , playing musical instruments and singing are all banned			0
statement : the school , pictured , has posted a letter to parents on its website claiming no staff members have ever raised concerns about the dress code the @entity43 teacher , who does not wish to be named , started work there when it opened as a multi-faith free school a year ago but left three months later after she felt the rules had become too ‘ strict ’			1
she said she was told nothing about a dress code in her interview or contract , but a month after she started the dress code handbook was distributed			1
she started by wearing a head scarf or small hat , but took it off after classes , for which she was reprimanded			0
shortly after that she began being ‘ hassled ’ about the rest of her clothing and , on one occasion , was sent a text from the school saying it ‘ insisted ’ on a ‘ modest dress code ’			1
she said she asked how her outfit – a business suit – was not modest and wrote to the head teacher saying she has always dressed in a professional manner			2
‘ the skirt was well below the knee and i wore thick black tights that covered my legs , ’ she said			0
the teacher has revealed how she was forced to resign after refusing to comply with a strict school dress code insisting all female staff wear hijabs regardless of their religion			1
she said : ' it was n’t until an induction session , just before the school opened , that female non-muslim staff were told they must wear a head covering , which was not made clear at any time during my interview for the job or was part of any contract			1
' i reluctantly complied and either wore a head scarf or small hat , but took it off when i was n’t in the classroom , but for which i was reprimanded			0
' wearing the head covering was difficult for me because i am a @entity43 and had i known it was compulsory for @entity96 staff i would never have accepted the position			2
' the teacher , who does not want to be named , said she was even sent a text from the school saying it ' insisted on ' a ' modest dress code			1
full length dress or skirt acceptable '			2
she said she asked how her outfit - a business suit - was not modest			2
' the skirt was well below the knee and i wore thick black tights that covered my legs ' , she said			0
the teacher told how she was offended at the suggestion her clothes were ' immodest ' and was left particularly angry after being was told to take instructions from two male teachers about what was considered ' modest '			1
she said : ' i wrote back to the head pointed out that " in nearly 20 years in teaching , i have always dressed in a professional manner "			0
' she claims the dress code was issued in a handbook to staff in october 2012 - just one month after the school opened			1
the book indicated that female staff should only have their faces and hands uncovered when in the school			1
she said : ' in the interim , i had expressed my concerns to the school about being forced to wear @entity4 dress but as there did not seem to be any leeway , i went on sick leave as advised by my union			1
strict : a former teacher at the @entity138 in @entity24 , pictured above , has revealed how she was forced to quit her job because she would n't adhere to a @entity141 - quoting dress code issued to staff ' the school then put me on " gardening leave " and i eventually left in december			1
' i am extremely disappointed by my experience			0
the school seems to me more concerned about dress codes and not putting the children ’s education first			1
' i also objected to the school ’s policy of sitting girls at the back of classrooms , to no avail			2
the reason given was that girls are allowed to look at boys but the boys are not allowed to look at the girls , but how can that be good for the children ’s education ? ' i am disappointed that the school does not appear to be the multi-faith school i was excited about joining			1
i felt oppressed , faced with prejudice and marginalised			0
i also missed opportunities to take other jobs because i accepted this one			0
' i have written and spoken to the @entity168 to complain about what has been happening at the school , and specifically about my experience , and am awaiting a response			2
' the @entity173 revealed on monday that , following a series of complaints , @entity175 inspectors are to be sent to @entity9 ‘ within days ’ to scrutinise the quality of teaching and leadership			1

' in all our adverts , and whenever we interview candidates , we draw their attention to our dress code , which we have based on our interpretation of modesty within our unique @entity225 environment			1
to date , the school has not received a single concern from colleagues about this issue			2
' it has also been suggested that girls are treated in a way that implies they are not equal to boys			0
in @entity237 , boys and girls have never been segregated either inside or outside the classroom			0
' in secondary , girls are seated as a group , either at one side of the classroom , or alternately at the front or the back of the room , swapping over from time to time			0
our intention is to respect both genders equally			0
these seating arrangements have been determined purely by practicalities such as the size of the classroom			0
' it is already being investigated by the @entity255 , from which it receives public money , over alleged irregularities over its grants			1
it has already been given £ 1.4 million and can expect to receive more to spend on a new building			0
now it is expected that officials from the @entity175 will inspect the school within days following the furore over the dress code claims and concerns by unions over the standards of education at the school			1

we have already been investigating this school for other reasons			0

within the school we value and esteem our teachers and consider them to be strong role models for all of the students and representatives of the school with all external individuals and organisations			0
we wish to create an @entity4 environment within the school for the sake of the students and to cater for the sensitivities of the community			0
although some of the following points are not islamically - binding upon all individuals except those who wish to adhere to the faith by choice , @entity138 has adopted them as a code of dress for all teachers			1
