' we fully expect him to resume his hosting duties later in the year			0
' @entity0 had been a regular feature on @entity3 television since taking over @entity1 in 1988 from previous producer @entity32			1
he is credited with taking the show from being a niche motoring programme to the most watched series on @entity3			2
the hosting slot would have marked @entity0 's first appearance on the @entity3 since he was dismissed from @entity1 for hitting producer @entity11 his brash presenting style and refusal to bow to pc culture earned him legions of admirers and critics , and controversy dogged his career			1
he was put on a ' final warning ' after allegedly saying a racial slur on air while reciting a nursery rhyme , and drew more unwanted attention after the top gear team were kicked out of @entity53 last year while filming a @entity54 special			0
@entity0 's car had a numberplate which was thought to be a deliberate reference the @entity58 , though the @entity3 denied this			1

@entity0 turned himself in to @entity3 bosses following the dust - up , and after an investigation director - general @entity65 decided against renewing his contract however , @entity0 is not banned from appearing on the @entity3 altogether , meaning he could have fulfilled his commitment to host the satirical news show , but has since withdrawn the gigs will be stripped of all @entity3 branding and content , and billed as @entity0 , @entity90 and @entity107			1
that means the shows , which will take in venues in @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 and the @entity114 , will not be able to use clips from the show or feature @entity117			0
the move has sparked rumours that the three men intend to team up to continue their careers together after @entity0 's exit from the corporation , but sources close to the tour say it is just a matter of fulfilling commitments to the fans			0
