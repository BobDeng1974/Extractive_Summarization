by @entity1 reporter published : 20:19 est , 4 february 2013 updated : 20:20 est , 4 february 2013 revealing : @entity2 said anger had been fuelled by reports that mps were demanding a pay rise politicians are pressing for state regulation of the @entity10 as direct revenge for the expenses scandal , a former minister warned yesterday			1
@entity13 mp @entity2 said some @entity5 were willing to use the power of @entity15 ‘ to bad effect ’ in order to get back at the @entity10			1
miss @entity2 , a former journalist , said anger had been fuelled by reports last month that mps were demanding a 32 per cent pay rise - with one mp telling her personally that they now backed state regulation			1
in an interview with @entity25 she said : ‘ the @entity26 had done this rather bizarre survey asking mps what we should be paid			2
‘ so this was published and papers reported it as : “ these fat cat @entity5 all think they should be paid 20 per cent more ”			2
which was not the case - but that was what the survey sort of suggested - it was n’t entirely accurate , it was an extrapolation from the survey			0
‘ and this mp said to me , “ well ... i was n’t going to vote for statutory underpinning , but i ’m minded now to do so			0
” if that happens on something as little as one storm in a teacup story about a little survey of 100 mps on their salaries , and the coverage of that , what if there is something more ? ‘ that shows you that the psychology exists in the pack of ( not all of the ) 650 mps ... that there can be a desire to use the powers that are there to bad effect			1
’ miss @entity2 said she disagreed with @entity68 ’s demand for new laws on press regulation , adding : ‘ i just think we have to have a look at where we want to be in 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 years ’ time			2
and once you do this it ’s very hard to unwind it			0
’ speaking yesterday she said the agenda was also driven partly by a ‘ very anti-murdoch feeling among some of my colleagues ’			1
miss @entity2 said the media also had a duty to demonstrate that it was willing to act more responsibly in the future			2
@entity85 added the agenda was also driven partly by a ' very anti-murdoch feeling among some of my colleagues ' but she called for politicians to support a free press - arguing that an unregulated @entity90 would result in a worse situation			1
‘ of course we get criticised in politics , ’ she said			0
‘ i do n’t mind as long as it is accurate , and i do think the media has to do more to stand up for good standards			0
‘ everyone should be wary of a world where we have to rely on @entity90 bloggers for news			0
but if we do n’t have a good , professional media we will just have more bloggers			0

@entity2 said anger fuelled by reports that mps were demanding a pay rise
added that psychology exists in the pack of 650 mps and there is a desire to use powers to bad effect
@entity119 agenda was driven party by ' a very anti-murdoch feeling '
