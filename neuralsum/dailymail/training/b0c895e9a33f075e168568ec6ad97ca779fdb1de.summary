@entity3 , @entity4 's company commander in @entity5 , who was , despite his @entity1 roots , spared from the genocide unleashed by the @entity7 some @entity9 escaped the @entity10 by fleeing the country , others hid and some battled to stay alive long enough to be freed from the @entity14 death camps			1
but @entity3 owed his survival to the personal intervention of @entity4			1
the @entity17 ordered his @entity19 thugs to leave the @entity1 judge alone because @entity3 had been his commanding officer during the @entity5			1
@entity4 looked back on his time on the @entity22 with great pride and fondness so , while some six million @entity1 perished in the @entity10 set in motion by @entity4 , @entity3 was allowed to live on the @entity17 's whim			1
his remarkable story was told by his daughter @entity28 , 86 , after a newspaper unearthed the letter sent on the orders of @entity4 insisting that @entity3 was not to be ' persecuted or deported '			1
a file kept by the @entity33 on him includes the letter from the head of the @entity33 and the @entity19 , @entity37 , dated august 27 , 1940 , saying @entity3 must receive ' relief and protection as per the @entity17 's wishes '			2
@entity37 made a point of informing all relevant authorities and officials that the judge was ' not to be inopportuned in any way whatsoever '			0
ironically , @entity3 told his daughter that he and his old comrades from the trenches hardly remembered @entity4 – by then a well - known figure in @entity51 politics – when they met at reunions in the 1920s and 30s			1
he told her that the future dictator rarely spoke and had few friends among the troops			0
historians have in recent years poured scorn on the @entity14 myth of the heroic corporal @entity4 running messages from one frontline trench to another			1
in fact , other soldiers regarded him as a ' rear area pig ' , taking his messages between @entity67 a few miles behind the front			0
@entity69 , born in 1890 , had joined the 2nd @entity70 as an officer at the beginning of the @entity5 , the same regiment that @entity74 - born @entity4 volunteered for			1
both men were deployed to the @entity77 front in autumn 1914 , serving in what was known as the @entity79 until 1918			0
@entity3 was seriously wounded in october of 1914 and again two years later in october 1916			2
in the summer of that year , the highly decorated officer had temporarily been @entity4 's company commander			1
although baptised a protestant , his mother was @entity1 and the @entity83 of 1935 , introduced by the @entity7 , classified him as a ' full blooded jew '			1
@entity3 , standing far right , with his unit during the @entity5 @entity4 ( pictured far right ) and @entity3 were both deployed to the @entity77 front in the fall of 1914 , serving in what was known as the ' @entity79 ' until 1918 the letter which was sent by @entity37 , reichsführer of the @entity19 and overlord of the death camps , dated 27 august 1940 , granting @entity3 ' relief and protection as per the @entity17 's wishes ' @entity3 with his wife @entity95 and daughter @entity28 in the early @entity97 @entity4 pictured in 1934			1
he remembered his time in the army fondly and was proud of his service in the war @entity3 was forced by the laws to quit his post as a judge in 1936			2
his family saw him being beaten up outside his house by @entity14 thugs the same year			2
he had petitioned @entity4 in june of 1936 asking for an exception to be made for him and his daughter under the race laws			1
in his letter @entity3 said : ' for us , it is a kind of spiritual death to now be branded as @entity1 and exposed to general contempt			2
' @entity3 ended up as a slave labourer , building barracks			0
this time he escaped extermination because of his ' privileged miscegenated marriage ' to @entity120 , a @entity121			0
his sister @entity122 was gassed at @entity123 , wrongly believing that the protection afforded to her brother extended to her			0
@entity3 died in @entity126 after a successful career in post-war @entity128 on september 14 , 1983			0
@entity3 moved his family to @entity129 , @entity130 in october 1937 , but was forced to return in 1939			0
hoping that his connections to @entity4 would keep him safe , he moved his family to a remote @entity133 village in mid- 1940			0
a copy of the letter @entity37 sent to the @entity33 in @entity136 was given to him			0
but in late june 1941 , @entity3 was summoned to appear before the @entity19 in @entity137			2
when he submitted his letter of protection it was taken from him and he was told it had been revoked in may of 1941 , and that he was now ' a jew like any other ' .			0

@entity3 commanded @entity4 's unit during the @entity5
baptised a @entity121 , he had a @entity1 mother and was thus regarded a ' full - blooded jew ' by @entity14 race laws
although *finally* thrown in *concentration* camp in 1941 , he survived the war to become *president* of the @entity152
