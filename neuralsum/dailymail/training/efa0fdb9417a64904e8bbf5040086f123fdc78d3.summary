by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 23:28 est , 24 october 2012 updated : 15:32 est , 25 october 2012 former @entity4 director general @entity3 has insisted the @entity6 public editor is ‘ completely correct ’ to question whether he is fit to be her new boss following the @entity9 scandal			1
mr @entity3 , who will start as the newspaper ’s chief executive next month on an estimated £ 3million a year with bonuses , spoke out after @entity13 questioned his integrity and ability in the wake of outrage against the corporation			1
but apparent contradictions in his account of what he knew about @entity9 's abuse while he ran the corporation have emerged today			1
@entity3 - who left his @entity4 post last month - said in an interview with the @entity6 today he had ' formed the impression ' last year that @entity27 was probing widespread sexual abuse by the @entity29 but ten days ago in the @entity6 he claimed he ' never heard any allegations ' about @entity9 when director general			1
new job : former @entity4 director @entity3 ( left ) has been under fire over the @entity9 ( right ) scandal in today 's revelations the 55 - year - old admitted he first heard about the probe from @entity4 foreign correspondent @entity38 last @entity39 , who told him : ‘ you must be really concerned about @entity27 's investigation into @entity9			1
is there in issue about an investigation on @entity27 about child abuse ? ' mr @entity3 , who is set to start his new job on november 12 , then spoke to an unnamed senior executive at the corporation before approaching @entity4 head of news @entity50 who then told him he should not be concerned by @entity27 's investigation into @entity54 and that it was dropped for journalistic reasons			1
' by this stage i think it is clear to me that it 's allegations which relate to sexual abuse of some kind , ' he told @entity63			1
' so , at this point , i think i have formed the impression and i 'm aware that they have been looking at allegations of abuse of some kind related to @entity9			1
but crucially i 'm told that the normal editorial process has taken place and @entity27 has decided not to proceed with the investigation			2
' after the interview @entity3 's spokesman @entity73 spoke to the paper about the apparent contradiction			2
mr @entity73 claimed @entity3 had been ' speculating ' nearly a year on about a general impression he may have formed at the time			1
talking about scrutiny from his future employer , he told the @entity81 it was ‘ totally reasonable for institutions like the @entity6 and the @entity4 to be free to examine everything , including subjects of corporate interest in the institution itself ’			1
mr @entity3 also said he was unaware if the allegations were sexual at the time , but was concerned by the limited details he received from the reporter and promptly tried to find out more			1
however , he said that after speaking to @entity90 , he did n’t need to take any further action as he believed her - and , regardless , ‘ nobody said there was an allegation of sex abuse on @entity4 premises ’			2
at conference : in a blog post on tuesday , @entity6 public editor @entity13 , who works on behalf of readers and writes about the newspaper itself , said : ' how likely is it that ( @entity3 ) knew nothing ? ' mr @entity3 said that he would have done something if those allegations had been raised			2
then he missed press cuttings in january and february that referred to the @entity27 probe being axed			0
' i do n't think there is anything in the account i have set out and what i did which would in any way affect my ability to discharge my duties as chief executive and president of the @entity6 company , ' he said			1
' his integrity and decision - making are bound to affect the @entity6 and its journalism - profoundly ' @entity13 , @entity6 public editor his comments came after mrs @entity13 questioned the man who was @entity4 director general when the report that would have exposed @entity9 as a predator who targeted young , vulnerable girls , was cancelled			1
in a blog post on tuesday , the public editor , who works on behalf of readers and writes about the newspaper itself , said : ' how likely is it that ( @entity3 ) knew nothing ? ' his integrity and decision - making are bound to affect the @entity6 and its journalism - profoundly			2
it 's worth considering now whether he is the right person for the job , given this turn of events			0
' worries : mr @entity3 said he first heard about the probe from @entity4 journalist @entity38 ( pictured ) , whom he said told him : ' you must be really concerned about @entity27 's investigation into @entity9 ' scandal has engulfed the @entity4 after an @entity148 documentary accused @entity9 of being a paedophile who had abused hundreds of young victims in hospitals , schools and even on the corporation 's premises			1
but even as the documentary went out , it emerged that @entity27 had carried out its own investigation - including an interview with the same victim - nearly a year before			0
a team spent six weeks probing allegations that the presenter abused pupils at a school in @entity163 , speaking to at least four women who claimed they had been assaulted or knew about events			0
the report was shelved at the last minute at the request of the programme 's editor @entity168			0
it was not until this week that the @entity4 aired its own investigation into the scandal , on @entity173			0
discussions : mr @entity3 said it was @entity4 head of news @entity50 ( pictured ) who told him he should not be concerned by @entity27 's investigation into @entity54 it covered both @entity182 's crimes and the @entity184 's reaction			1
mr @entity168 stood aside from his role at @entity27 after the @entity4 said his explanation for shelving the story was ' inaccurate or incomplete '			0
earlier this week new @entity4 director general @entity188 was grilled by mps in parliament			1
he denied that the broadcaster helped cover up allegations that @entity9 preyed on women			0
the @entity4 has now launched two inquiries into the affair			0
one will address @entity9 's actions and how he went undetected during his career			2
a second will examine why the @entity27 report was pulled			0
meanwhile pressure grew on his predecessor mr @entity3 , who left his £ 622,000 post at the @entity4 earlier this year			2
one @entity205 analyst called for the paper to delay him taking over the company			0
' it seems to me he will have to attend a hearing in the @entity214 parliament , ' @entity209 analyst @entity208 said			0
' that is going to be a distraction			0
it 's an unexpected complication			0
' influential : the front cover of the @entity6 on october 24 , with president @entity220 pictured public editor @entity13 wrote in her blog : ' how likely is it that he knew nothing ? a director general of a giant media company is something like a newspaper ’s publisher ... publishers usually do n’t know about editorial decisions — unless they are very big ones , fraught with legal implications			2
' his integrity and decision - making are bound to affect the @entity6 and its journalism — profoundly			0
it ’s worth considering now whether he is the right person for the job , given this turn of events			0
' the @entity6 might start by publishing an in - depth interview with mr. @entity3 exploring what exactly he knew , and when , about what happened at the @entity4			2
' what are the implications of these problems for him as incoming @entity6 chief executive ? what are the implications for the @entity252 to have its new @entity253 – who needs to deal with many tough business challenges here – arriving with so much unwanted baggage ? ' mrs @entity13 declined to comment further on her blog as did the @entity6			1
as public editor and a representative of readers , she writes about issues affecting the newspaper independent from @entity6 management , including chairman and publisher @entity266 and executive editor @entity267			0
since stepping into the role in september , mrs @entity13 has already made waves including a post that criticised the paper 's decision not to publish on the front page a story about a congressional hearing into attacks on a @entity278 consulate in @entity279 , @entity280 , last month in which four @entity278 were killed .			0

former @entity4 director general starts as @entity6 chief executive next month
insisted it 's ' totally reasonable for paper to be free to examine everything '
@entity3 admits today he ' formed the impression ' @entity27 was probing @entity9 's campaign of sexual abuse
this *statement* contradicts his comment last week that he ' never heard any allegations ' about @entity29 while running the @entity4
@entity4 reporter @entity38 told him last year : ' you must be really concerned about @entity27 's investigation into @entity9 ’
he then approached head of news @entity50 who assured him he should n't be worried , adding it was dropped for journalistic reasons , he said
