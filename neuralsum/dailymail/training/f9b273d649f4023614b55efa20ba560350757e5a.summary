@entity0 has warned @entity1 they will continue to drop points unless they find a way to take the strain off @entity7			1
@entity7 has been their standout player this season , netting eight times after a stunning 25 - goal debut season			1
no other @entity1 player has scored more than three @entity14 goals and @entity0 admitted there is a concern that not enough players beside the @entity18 are taking their chances			1
we need to chip in with more goals as a team			1
we need to find goals from other places on the pitch			2
' it 's been a peculiar season for @entity1			1
they have been comfortably within the top 10 until now but have coughed 16 points from winning positions			0
they never led in the 2 - 1 defeat against @entity23 on sunday but wasted numerous chances , with @entity0 believing they need to be more clinical in front of goal			0
@entity7 cancelled out @entity45 's fourth minute opener buy a late @entity47 goal secured the win he said : ' all of us , @entity49 included , get a lot of chances and if we go 2 - 0 up i a sure that we can win the game			1
we have got this record from losing from winning positions , but i ’m pretty sure that all of them have been one goal and there have been games where we ’ve had a lot of chances after we scored the first goal			2
' it ’s pretty simple really - we need to convert the chances but i do n’t know how we do that , how we change that , it is what it is			0
i just think the chances we get , the positions we find ourselves in , we have to take them			0
' i do n’t think we have scored from a set pieces ourselves			2
we have got a lot of height in team and we all have to do better			0
when you say we have to take our chances you do look at the guys up front as that ’s what they do , but as a team we need to share the goals around			0
' @entity0 ( right ) competes for a header with @entity88 's @entity87			0
