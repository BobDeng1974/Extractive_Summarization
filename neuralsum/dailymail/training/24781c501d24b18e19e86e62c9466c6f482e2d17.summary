one in four women in some parts of the @entity4 smoke while they are pregnant , shocking new figures have revealed			1
and across the country as a whole , one in eight women smoke during pregnancy			1
despite strong health guidance urging women to quit while preparing for motherhood , about 12 per cent of mothers - to - be in @entity11 classed themselves as smokers in 2013/14			1
the highest rates of smoking during pregnancy were found in @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 this rose to an 27.5 per cent of mothers - to - be in @entity19			1
however , the overall figures have dropped to an eight - year low – in 2006/07 15.1 per cent of expectant mothers smoked			1
despite this , the researchers say more still needs to be done to reach a national target to bring the rates of smoking in pregnancy down to 11 per cent or less by the end of 2015			0
in the 12 months to march this year , 75,910 expectant mothers classed themselves as smokers out of 632,960 pregnant women , according to the @entity37 ( @entity37 )			1
in some parts of the country more than one in four pregnant women admitted to being smokers			1
for example , of those being cared for by @entity43 , 27.5 per cent of pregnant women were smokers			1
in 2013/14 12 per cent of pregnant women in @entity11 smoked - this was the lowest level for eight years the second highest smoking rate was found in @entity20 where 25 per cent of pregnant women smoked and @entity21 comes in third with 23.9 per cent of mothers - to - be failing to kick the habit			1
meanwhile only 1.9 per cent of women cared for by @entity52 or @entity53 smoked during pregnancy			2
@entity55 and @entity56 23.5 % 5			0
@entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 22.3 % 8			0
@entity64 21.9 % ‘ it is encouraging to see that since 2006 - 07 the number of pregnant women who smoked during pregnancy has declined , ’ said @entity37 chairman @entity65			1
‘ however , there is still a little way to go to achieve the national ambition			0
‘ today 's figures highlight there is a still work to be done and it is fundamental that mothers - to - be are aware of the damaging effects smoking can have on their baby			2
’ @entity79 , director for midwifery at the @entity81 , added : ‘ the evidence about the damage to women and their developing baby from smoking is large and growing , so while the fall is welcome we must strive to reduce it even further			0
this is particularly needed in high smoking areas			0
‘ targets for reduction are fine but they need to be backed up with resources			0
‘ health providers should ensure there are enough midwives with the time to offer women support , advice and referral to smoking cessation services			0
‘ continuity of care is also important so that midwives can develop a trusting relationship with women , which is critical if women are to feel comfortable in talking about issues such as this			0
‘ there is also a need for support services that work with the whole family			0
it is important for the health of the foetus and babies that the woman is in a smoke free environment			0
’ there 's a national target to bring the rate of smoking in pregnancy down to 11 per cent by the end of 2015 the news comes just days after research from the @entity128 revealed white women in @entity130 are more likely to smoke during pregnancy than those from any other ethnic group in the country			2
the study showed that a quarter of white women in @entity130 smoke while pregnant , compared to about 15 per cent of white mothers of other nationalities living in @entity130			2
@entity140 , @entity141 and @entity142 mothers - to - be in @entity130 were the least likely to smoke - less than seven per cent of these women smoked when they were pregnant			1
professor @entity145 from the @entity146 at the @entity128 said : ' @entity130 has one of the poorest health records in @entity149			0
‘ it is vital that we take steps to reduce smoking during pregnancy and improve social circumstances for all @entity130 mothers if we are to redress this imbalance			2
' smoking during pregnancy is strongly discouraged because it can lead to stillbirth , miscarriage , low birth weight and an increased risk of cot death after birth .			2

in @entity19 , 27.5 % of expectant mothers in 2013 - 14 admitted to smoking
