@entity1 ’s decision to leave @entity2 and join @entity3 may appear strange – particularly as the 23 - year - old should be about to enter his prime			1
but he ’s not the first footballer to undergo a transfer that has left everyone else open - mouthed and scratching their heads			2
see if you agree with our list of the 10 great jaw - dropping moves			2
bit of a gamble : @entity1 has officially made the move to @entity18 ' @entity3 from @entity2 big move : once first - choice ahead of @entity20 the transfer is somewhat of a surprise for most @entity23 was one of the game ’s superstars and had been crowned @entity27 footballer of the year in 1977			1
when @entity28 joined @entity2 in 1982 , he had to make way but nobody could have predicted he would turn up next at @entity32 @entity31			2
alas , it did n’t work out			0
@entity23 only played 17 times before the south - east @entity36 club were unable to pay his considerable wages			2
to prove there were no hard feelings though , @entity23 has been back to @entity40 since as a fan			0
ill - fated : 1977 's @entity43 , @entity2 's @entity42 , played just 17 times for @entity31 2 @entity44 – @entity45 to @entity46 , 2012 @entity44 chose a radical new challenge after scoring the decisive shoot - out penalty for @entity45 in the 2012 @entity50 final that cemented his status as one of the club ’s greatest - ever players			1
his arrival at @entity46 was meant to revolutionise @entity57 football in a similar way to @entity59 and the @entity60			1
but the partnership failed to work and @entity44 headed back west to @entity63 just six months into his contract despite protestations from @entity66			1
@entity45 to @entity57 : @entity44 went from scoring the 2012 @entity50 winning penalty to @entity66 3 juninho – @entity69 to @entity70 , 1995 some questioned the midfielder ’s sanity when he swapped the passion and excitement of @entity77 ’s largest city for industrial @entity78 , attracted by the @entity80 revolution that was going on			1
thousands of @entity70 fans turned out to see their diminutive new star arrive and the hospitality worked			1
@entity84 fell in love with the north - east , and ended up having three spells with the club			2
famously he helped them reach two cup finals in 1997 and was left in tears when they were relegated from the @entity92 on the final day of the same season			0
surprise : @entity77 star @entity84 made the move from @entity96 to @entity80 's @entity70 4 @entity97 – @entity98 to @entity70 , 2007 this is not meant to be a personal attack on @entity70 , but how many players would have considered moving from the @entity102 to the @entity103			1
being a local boy like @entity97 helped and the defender was tempted by home comforts after three injury - plagued years in @entity107 , where he played in a @entity110 side alongside the likes of @entity112 and @entity59			1
real big move : @entity97 transfered from @entity114 's @entity98 to his home town 5 @entity116 – @entity45 to @entity117 , 2007 @entity116 had been @entity119 ’s first signing after taking over at @entity45 and was tipped for great things at @entity121			1
but when he fell out with @entity122 , he was persuaded by sweet - talking @entity123 to leave the @entity124 and play his football at ramshackle @entity126			0
in the short - term , the move seemed to work with the player winning the @entity130 in 2008			0
but @entity117 were living beyond their means and @entity116 quickly joined the exodus from the south coast to join @entity134			0
bridge to shore : @entity123 and @entity117 snagged @entity119 's first @entity45 signing in 2007 6 @entity138 – @entity139 to @entity140 , 1980 @entity138 was the biggest superstar of his day ; the reigning @entity27 player of the year and famous enough to make a pop record that went into the charts			1
his club @entity139 had just played in the @entity50 final and were considered one of the biggest teams in @entity149 at the time			2
so @entity138 was the last person on journalists ’ minds when unfashionable @entity140 called a press conference – they thought it was to do with ground redevelopment at the @entity156			0
there were audible gasps when @entity138 , @entity159 ’s captain , walked in with his new manager @entity160			0
chart - topper : @entity138 was a superstar in @entity163 and @entity159 captain when he joined @entity140 7 @entity164 – @entity98 to @entity165 , 2005 @entity164 was from the @entity167 school of not fully appreciating foreign countries and was desperate to return to @entity159 after 12 months in @entity169			1
the best financial offer on the table was from @entity165 so @entity134 legend @entity164 bit the bullet and signed on for manager @entity173 and chairman @entity174 for a club that had n’t won a trophy since 1970			1
he did n’t endear himself to @entity178 fans by continuing to spend time in the north - west and flying up to training by helicopter			0
and a dismal four years was capped by relegation in 2009			0
dismal : @entity164 's illustrious career has a black and white hole in it that ended with @entity165 's relegation 8 ivan campo – @entity98 to @entity189 , 2003 the bushy - haired @entity190 had won the @entity50 in five successful years in @entity98 but when he fell out of favour at the start of the @entity110 era , he decided @entity194 and @entity189 were for him			1
after a year ’s loan to bed in , @entity190 joined on a permanent basis and became a huge favourite with @entity189 fans , who turned up to matches wearing wigs in his honour			1
@entity194 also found a new role for @entity190 in holding midfield and he stayed at the @entity206 for five seasons			2
beloved : @entity208 - haired @entity190 won the @entity50 with @entity98 but @entity189 are glad he left 9 @entity209 – @entity134 to @entity210 , 2012 new @entity134 manager @entity211 wanted to keep @entity212 at @entity213 where he ’d just won the @entity214			1
but the @entity215 wanted to be closer to his family in south wales and harboured a dream of helping his local club reach the @entity92 for the first time , something he ’d been unable to do in an earlier loan spell			0
so @entity212 swapped the “ this is @entity213 ” sign for the more modest trappings of @entity210 and had the last laugh when @entity3 won promotion under @entity227 , something the forward rated as the best achievement of his career			2
homecoming : @entity209 was wanted by @entity134 but wanted more to help @entity210 get promoted - and did 10 @entity232 – @entity233 to @entity234 , 2001 @entity232 was regarded as one of the best @entity237 players of his generation with 35 international caps and 15 years service with @entity241 before moving to @entity233			0
at the age of 36 , he was persuaded by @entity234 manager @entity243 to come to @entity159 , the move suggested by @entity232 ’s former boss @entity245 who had worked with @entity243 for the @entity159 national team			0
@entity232 ’s legs had gone by the time he arrived in the east @entity248 and he played only three times for @entity234			0
on the plus side , he formed an unlikely friendship with another @entity234 player , @entity252 , that lasts til this day			0
past his prime : @entity232 was n't at his finest when he got to @entity234 from @entity233			0

@entity1 joined @entity18 ' @entity3 from the @entity255 on a four - year deal
@entity44 famously moved from @entity50 *victory* with @entity45 to @entity46
@entity98 transplant @entity190 was a hit at @entity189 and @entity97 was good for @entity70 , but @entity164 at @entity165 *...*
