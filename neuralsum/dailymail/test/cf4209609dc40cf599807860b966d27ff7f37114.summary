@entity0 might have given up hope of qualifying for the @entity2 , but @entity3 wo n’t hear any of it			1
the 21 - year - old , who became the youngest @entity7 captain this season during the drab goalless draw against @entity10 on @entity11 , still retains belief they can gatecrash the top - four party			1
spurs are now seven points behind @entity16 , who play @entity18 on monday night , with just seven games remaining			1

we start on saturday [ at home against @entity37 ]			2

@entity3 could not find a way to break the deadlock for @entity20 in their 0 - 0 draw at @entity45 on sunday throwing him the armband was a move bourne out of necessity by the manager , and it was something he relished			1
' it 's a real honour , a very proud moment for myself to lead the side out , ’ @entity3 added			1
‘ it 's very special for me			2
hopefully there is more to come in the years to come			2

it 's a very young team and everyone has their say			0
to be given the armband by the gaffer is a proud moment			0
but there are a lot of captains out there and we all try and work to the same aim			0
’ at just 21 years and 251 days , the @entity20 striker led out his side for the first time in draw with @entity10 he and @entity10 ’s @entity78 are also working to the same aim - bidding to work their way into the thoughts of @entity82 manager @entity81 ahead of next summer ’s @entity83 in @entity84			1
both will be handed spots in @entity88 ’s squad for the @entity89 21 euros at the end of this season			1
@entity3 hopes their partnership can be one replicated for the seniors in years to come			1
@entity3 and @entity10 striker @entity78 will both be handed spots in @entity88 's @entity89 21 euros squad ‘ @entity96 was a great experience , ’ he said			1

it was tough and i can only learn from those sort of games			0
‘ @entity78 ’s a great player			0
i know him well from the @entity103			0
he scores goals and his movement 's great			0
he 's a prospect for @entity108 football			0
