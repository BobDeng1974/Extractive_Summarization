' but the requested leave was ' not effectively communicated ' to the teacher and she only learned about the leave when she returned from the trip , the @entity12 said			2
' this communication failure is unacceptable , and the leadership of @entity101 and the @entity12 has apologized to mrs. @entity11 for this failure , ' it continued			2

' more than anything i want educators to educate , and parents to support them , and administrators to support the educators , ' she wrote in a statement			0
' then the kids get the best education and that is part of the problem here , the kids were lost in this equation			0

@entity11 went on a medical mission to a small @entity6 town that was more than 4,000 miles away from the @entity2 outbreak in @entity78

@entity18 said the decision was based on ' ignorance ' and that the leave was never properly communicated to her and she has now resigned
the school has apologized to @entity18 and says it regrets her resignation
