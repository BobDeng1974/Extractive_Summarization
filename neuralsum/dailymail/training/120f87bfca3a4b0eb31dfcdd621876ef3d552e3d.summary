by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:26 est , 5 july 2012 updated : 01:41 est , 6 july 2012 issue : dr @entity3 said children 's units , which attract higher numbers of female doctors , were a particular cause of concern women doctors who only work part - time are causing staffing issues that could create problems in the future , an expert has warned			1
dr @entity3 said children 's units , which attract higher numbers of female doctors , were a particular cause of concern			1
she said many tended to work three days a week once they had started families , which led to gaps in the rota which means the remaining doctors had to work for longer periods			2
she also said @entity28 care of sick children compared poorly with the rest of @entity31 and many more lives could be saved			1
dr @entity33 , president of the @entity34 , said there were currently no safety issues , but the situation could change for the worse			2
there are just under 5,000 paediatricians in the @entity28 , of whom three quarters are women			2
dr @entity33 said children 's wards traditionally had higher numbers of female doctors			1
@entity46 and @entity47 on the other hand tend to attract more men as they are regarded as ' macho '			2
she said : ' female doctors make great paediatricians but we do have problems planning			0
' a significant proportion of people will be working less than full time so our numbers are less than we need to cover rotas			0
' we are certainly trying to encourage men			0
i 'm not saying we 've got too many women , but the particular balance of females to males just happens to make it harder for us to plan services and means we have a high vacancy rate			0
' we end up with gaps in the rotas			0
the result of that is that consultants have to work very short notice overnight and work the next day			0
' as a speciality we can carry that on for a while but we would n't really want an airline pilot working like that and do n't want a paediatrician doing that			0
' at the moment we have not reached the stage where it 's unsafe , per se , because the majority of time we have cover			1
' but if it continues â€“ and if we have n't got better ways of running services and that affects morale and recruitment into the speciality			0
then that will become problematic			0
we 're holding the line on patient safety , but it 's not a good long - term position			1
' concerning : dr @entity33 said there are just under 5,000 paediatricians in the @entity28 , of whom three quarters are women ( file pic ) dr @entity33 told @entity105 's @entity104 that the lives of 1,500 children in @entity28 could be saved every year if the care matched that of other @entity31 countries			1
she warned that common conditions such as asthma , meningitis and pneumonia were not being picked up early enough by doctors			0
dr @entity33 said : ' we 've looked at mortality rates for children up to ages of 18 and we 're comparing poorly not just with @entity120 but most of @entity31			1
' ' it 's with common childhood illnesses that we should be able to pick up and treat			1
things like asthma , meningitis and pneumonia that are a real test of how the health system is working			0
' she added : ' it 's a whole system problem			2
it 's not about paediatrics doing badly or gps doing badly or @entity47 doctors , it 's about how we work together across system and how well trained everyone is to recognise a child who is sick			1

children 's units are cause for concern , says leading doctor
care of sick children compares poorly with the rest of @entity31
