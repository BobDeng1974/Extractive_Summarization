under threat : a man from @entity2 in the @entity3 is trying to claim asylum in @entity5 on the grounds that he is fleeing the effects of climate change a man from one of the @entity12 's lowest - lying nations is trying to convince judges he and his family are refugees			1
but he admits they are not fleeing persecution ; instead , he says , they are trying to escape the disastrous effects of climate change			1
the 37 - year - old and his wife left his remote atoll in the @entity3 nation of @entity2 six years ago for drier land in @entity5 , where their three children were born			1
but immigration authorities have twice rejected his argument that rising sea levels make too dangerous for him and his family to return to his homeland			1
on october 16 , the man 's lawyer , @entity31 , plans to argue the case before @entity5 's @entity34			1
mr @entity31 , who specialises in human rights cases , told @entity36 he will appeal the case all the way to the country 's @entity39 if necessary			0
legal experts consider the man 's case a long shot , but it will nevertheless be closely watched , and might have implications for tens of millions of residents in low - lying territories around the world			1
@entity2 , an impoverished string of 33 coral atolls about halfway between @entity51 and @entity52 , is home to about 103,000 people and has been identified by scientists as among the nations most vulnerable to climate change			1
in a transcript of the immigration case obtained by the @entity36 , the @entity2 man describes extreme high tides known as king tides that he says have started to regularly breach @entity2 's coastal defences			1
these inundations of saltwater , he says , kill crops , flood homes and sicken the country 's people			0
@entity5 's immigration laws prevent the @entity36 from naming the asylum seeker			1
he said that starting around 1998 , king tides began regularly breaching the sea walls around his village , which was overcrowded and had no sewerage system			0
the fouled drinking water would make people vomit , he said , and there was no higher ground that would allow villagers to escape the knee - deep water			2
he claimed that returning to the island would endanger the lives of his two youngest children			0
' there 's no future for us when we go back to @entity2 , ' he told the tribunal , according to the transcript			0
' especially for my children			0
there 's nothing for us there			0
' the man 's lawyer said the family is currently living and working on a @entity5 farm			1
' save us ' : @entity2 stand outside their country 's parliament with signs calling for immediate action on climate change , which is believed to be the cause of rising sea levels that are gradually drowning the @entity3 nation an international panel of climate scientists last week issued a report saying that it was ' extremely likely ' that human activity was causing global warming , and predicted that oceans could rise by as much as a metre ( 3ft 3â…œin ) by the end of the century			1
if that were to happen , much of @entity2 would simply disappear			0
though that is a dire prospect , @entity5 's @entity117 has said it is not one that is addressed by laws dealing with refugees			0
in a decision recently made public , tribunal member @entity120 said the legal concept of a refugee is someone who is being persecuted , which requires human interaction			0
he said the tribunal rejected the man 's claim because nobody is persecuting him			0
the tribunal found there was no evidence that the environmental conditions on @entity2 were so bad that the man and his family would face imminent danger should they return			2
mr @entity120 said the man 's claim was also rejected because the family 's predicament was no different than that faced by the wider population of @entity2			1
in his court appeal , mr @entity31 , the man 's lawyer , said the fact that many people face the same threat is no grounds to dismiss a claim			0
he also argued that his client did suffer an indirect form of human persecution because climate change is believed to be caused by the pollution humans generate			2
he said his client also would face the threat of a climate - induced breakdown in law and order should he return			2
a man cleans his bike next to simple huts like the ones most @entity2 live in : the asylum seeker described extreme high tides known as king tides that have started to regularly breach @entity2 's coastal defences a typical house in @entity2 : he said that starting around 1998 , king tides began regularly breaching the sea walls around his village , which was overcrowded and had no sewerage system , leaving residents sickened @entity176 , a constitutional law expert and associate professor at the @entity178 , said he applauded mr @entity31 's ' ingenious arguments '			1
but he did n't think they would succeed because his client has n't been singled out and victimised due to something like his gender , race or political persuasion			0
nevertheless , @entity176 added that even if the @entity2 man loses , his case might make a good argument for expanding the definition of what constitutes a refugee			2
he said he expected there would be increasing pressure on nations like @entity5 and @entity52 to help provide new homes for @entity195 threatened by rising seas			2
tidal gauges indicate the world 's oceans have been rising at an annual rate of 3.2mm ( 0.1in ) since 1970			0
many scientists expect that rate to accelerate and for climate change to trigger more intense storms , which may pose an even more pressing threat to many of the world 's low - lying islands			1
must have a good reason to want to leave ... legal experts consider the man 's case a long shot , but it will be closely watched , and might have implications for tens of millions who live in low - lying places around the world @entity2 's government is pursuing its own strategies			1
it has paid a deposit for 6,000 acres in nearby @entity222 , which @entity2 president @entity223 has said will provide food security and a possible refuge for future generations			0
the nation has also been talking with a @entity229 firm about the possibility of constructing a floating island , which would cost billions of dollars			0
@entity232 , a @entity2 government spokesman who said his opinions on the matter were his own , said he thought the man in @entity5 was taking the wrong approach			2
he said the government is working hard to train people in skills like nursing , carpentry and automotive repairs so that if they do leave @entity2 , they can be productive in their adoptive countries			0
' @entity2 may be doomed by climate change in the near future , ' he said			1
' but just claiming refugee status due to climate change is the easy way out			2

the 37 - year - old left his atoll six years ago for drier land in @entity5
he says rising sea levels make it too dangerous his family to return
@entity2 is one of the nations most *susceptible* to climate change
but immigration authorities have twice rejected his claim for asylum
now his lawyer is set to argue his case before the @entity34
legal experts say arguments are ' ingenious ' but expect them to fail
