an ancient mummy who has been on display in the @entity4 for over 100 years was a young man murdered by a killer who stabbed him in the back , new research shows			1
scans of the ancient @entity9 , known officially as @entity11 man but nicknamed @entity12 for his red hair , show that a puncture just beneath his left shoulderblade was made by his murderer			1
forensic experts studied the scan on a ' virtual autopsy table ' concluded that there is almost no doubt he was the victim of a deliberate , violent killing in peacetime			2
the scans , which go on display today , allow visitors to virtually zoom through @entity12 's body the @entity12 , also known as @entity12 for his red hair , a 5,500 - year - old mummy displayed in the @entity4			1
researchers have found a wound on his back was caused by his murderer @entity34 , the museum 's expert on human remains , told @entity37 : ' his left shoulderblade is slightly damaged			1
' you can see that the rib immediately under the shoulderblade has been shattered in such a way that it has splintered into his tissue			2
' this shows immense force			2
' the force is such that the blade would have penetrated through his lung			2
' shattered bones : this scan image shows how @entity54 ribs splintered into his soft tissue after the blade was plunged into his back no chance : the fatal wound was inflicted just beneath @entity12 's left shoulderblade new display : from today visitors can use a touch screen to look inside @entity12 's body to see if there are any other clues about his life and death examinations also showed he was a young man , aged between just 18 and 20 when he was killed , and impressively muscled			1
mr @entity34 said he believes a lack of defensive wounds suggest @entity12 was the victim of a surprise attack			1
a blade of copper or sharpened flint at least 5in long and 0.7in wide made the injury , he said			2
the way that @entity12 's shattered bones remained in the soft tissue surrounding them indicates the injury took place while he was alive			1
professor @entity85 of the @entity86 ( @entity87 ) , a @entity89 expert , who also uses the virtual autopsy system for criminal and accident cases in @entity93 , confirmed the @entity4 ’s assessment that the force of the blow was such that it also shattered the rib immediately below the shoulder blade , embedding bone fragments into his muscle tissue , and injuring the left lung and surrounding blood vessels			0
the absence of any signs of healing and the severity of the injuries suggest that this can be considered the cause of death			1
the body , the @entity114 museum 's most popular attraction after the @entity115 , has rarely been moved since first being put on display in 1901			1
forensic investigation : scientists examined @entity12 using a computer axial tomography ( @entity120 ) scanner , with just 30 seconds of scans giving them enough data for a detailed investigation of his insides to carry out their investigations , curators carried the mummy carefully on a duvet and packed it into a van for the drive to @entity133 in nearby @entity134			1
forensic scientists examined @entity12 using a computer axial tomography ( @entity120 ) scanner , with just 30 seconds of scans giving them enough data for a detailed investigation of his insides			1
the three - dimensional image created by the machine was than imported into software developed by the @entity142 which allows investigators to rotate , enlarge and virtually cut layers away			0
the late @entity146 period in @entity9 is known as the @entity148 period			0
it began in the sixth millennium @entity150 , and ended with the unification of @entity9 , which marked the start of the historical period in @entity9			0
it is traditionally divided into two subgroups , called the @entity154 ( 4000 - 3500 bc ) and the @entity157 period ( 3500 - 3100 bc )			0
@entity158 was an important southern town where these periods were first distinguished in modern times			0
the inhabitants of @entity9 first lived in settlements during the @entity148 period			0
cemeteries were located in the low desert near the settlements , and the north and south of the country were culturally distinct			0
the south was administered from the city of @entity172 , while the capital of the north was @entity175			0
burials at the time were simple pit graves , in which the corpse was laid in a crouched position and naurally dried by the hot sand			0
in later burials , the bodies were sometimes wrapped in mat , and the person 's head and limbs bound with cloth			0
the objects placed in burials , such as items of jewellery , slate palettes and pots are the main sources of information about this time			0
curators had not even seen the underside of the ancient murder victim for 100 years , dr @entity34 told @entity37 , but now , using the computer model , they can examine almost all his internal organs in detail			0
further research could now be done to paint a picture of @entity12 's final few hours before his killer caught up with him			1
the @entity4 's team should be able to analyse his last meal , dr @entity34 said , and even see what he ate in his last three months by an analysis of his hair and fingernails			2
he added : ' not only have we been able to discover that @entity12 was young when he died but , unexpectedly , the 3d visualisation of the ct scan has confirmed that he was stabbed in the back			1
' the analysis of ancient human remains rarely reveals the cause of death but the cut on his back , as well as the damage to the underlying shoulder blade and rib , are characteristic of a single penetrating wound			1
' the virtual autopsy table has allowed us explore the ct scan data interactively and clearly visualise his skeleton and internal organs , something that is not always possible with other methods			0
' @entity12 as he was originally displayed at the @entity4 a new display unveiled today based on the findings allows visitors to use a touch screen to look inside his body to see if there are any other clues about his life and death			1
using the interactive touchscreen and the gesture based interface it is possible to strip away the skin to expose his skeleton , and make virtual slices to view his internal organs and his brain			0
@entity253 of the @entity142 said ‘ this powerful visualisation system has enabled not just remarkable new revelations about one of the @entity4 ’s most iconic mummies , but also brings the thrill of discovery straight to the gallery for the public			0
' using exactly the same technology that the scientists use , visitors to the museum can now explore for themselves and , who knows , perhaps even make their own new discovery with the exhibit			2

@entity12 , named for his red hair , was found to have been killed by a stab wound on his back after a 3d post-mortem using medical scans
visitors can see the scans and use a touch screen to look inside his body to see if there are any other clues about his life and death
