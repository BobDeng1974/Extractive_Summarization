by @entity0 for @entity1 traditional @entity3 could disappear from @entity4 for good - because the breed of cow which produces it is dying out , experts have warned			1
farmers claim there are now fewer than 450 @entity10 left in the country thanks to @entity13 regulations over @entity14 and a lack of interest from breeders			1
if the breed became extinct it would spell the end of @entity22 cheese and ' real ' @entity3 , which is only made from pedigree cows			1
farmers claim there are now fewer than 450 @entity10 ( pictured ) left in the country thanks to @entity13 regulations over @entity14 and a lack of interest from breeders @entity27 , who has helped protect rare breeds for four decades at @entity29 near @entity30 , @entity31 , said the loss would be ' devastating ' for cheese production			1
mr @entity27 , the father of @entity35 star @entity34 , said : ' it would be heartbreaking if we were to lose the breed			0
' apart from them being my favourite breed there would be devastating consequences - especially for cheeses			0
' both single and double @entity22 cheese have become renowned , not only in @entity47 , but around the world			2
' back in the day you would n't be able to get milk from @entity22 to @entity51 before it went off so they would make @entity3 with it instead			1
' he said one of the primary reasons for the lack of @entity10 was due to the @entity14 regulations imposed by the @entity13			1
the herds are at an increased risk as many of them are kept in @entity31 , which is a tb hotspot			0
mr @entity27 said that the breed would survive a lot longer if they could be vaccinated against @entity14			2
he said : ' if we were able to give our cattle tb vaccinations then they would stand a much better change of lasting longer			0
' unfortunately we ca n't do this because of @entity13 regulations			0
their rules prohibit the use of @entity14 vaccinations			2
' this is because if a cow has been vaccinated against it , when blood is taken from the vaccinated animals it will test positive for the disease			0
' if the breed became extinct it would spell the end of @entity22 cheese and ' real ' @entity3 , which is only made from pedigree cows			1
pictured is cheese maker @entity89 , 86 , from @entity22 ( file image ) @entity22 cows have always been lower in numbers than other breeds of cattle due to the fact they produce less milk			1
but the milk they do produce is well - suited for cheese making due to the fact it is high in protein and butterfat			0
single @entity22 cheese is made exclusively from @entity22 cattle milk - meaning it would no longer be produced if the cows were extinct			1
it has @entity109 ( protected designation of origin ) status so it can only be made from @entity22 cattle in @entity22			1
double @entity22 cheese is now widely made from the milk of any cattle , but the extinction of the breed would spell the end for ' traditional ' @entity3			1
mr @entity27 explained : ' @entity3 can now be made using the milk of other cows but it is not quite the same			1
' it would be like making your own champagne at home and calling it champagne - it does n't quite work			0
' @entity128 , 50 , who has worked with the cattle alongside his father at the family farm near @entity132 , @entity31 , since he was just seven , said : ' the number of @entity22 cows has seriously been declining over the years			1
' one of the reasons for this is due to the @entity14 regulations that have been brought into play			1
' it makes moving bulls around very difficult and so a lot of farmers have given up breeding their @entity22 cattle			1
@entity22 is a traditional , semi-hard cheese which has been made in @entity31 since the 16th century			2
there are two types - @entity148 and @entity149 - and both are traditionally made from milk from @entity31 breed cows			2
both types have a natural rind and a hard texture , but @entity22 is more crumbly and lighter in texture			0
the flower known as @entity158 was responsible for the distinctive yellow colour of @entity3 ( file image ) the flower known as @entity158 was responsible for the distinctive yellow colour of @entity3			0
the reason for the two types being referred to as @entity149 and @entity148 is not known but theories include because the creamy milk had to be skimmed twice to make the double variety , or because cream from the morning milk was added to the evening milk			0
there is also a theory that it was because @entity3 cheese is typically twice the height			0
' also back in the 1970s there was lots of enthusiasm to increase the numbers of the breed			0
however all of those farmers are now in their 80s			0
' @entity22 cheese can only be produced by people with @entity22 cattle , so without them we would n't see it on the shelf any more			2
' @entity3 can now be made using milk from other cows but it would be a bit like having a @entity190 that was n't from @entity191			2
' back in 1972 the breed was in danger of dying out - with just 60 bovines left , however a group of dedicated farmers worked to increase the herds to almost 1,000 but the 1990s			2
now , the @entity22 breed , which has a white belly , tail and stripe down its spine , is in danger once again with just 450 registered cattle still alive			1
the milk of @entity22 cows is well - suited for cheese making due to the fact it is high in protein and butterfat			2
@entity128 , a member of the @entity210 , added : ' i would be absolutely devastated if the breed was to die out			0
' not forgetting these cows were also used to test cures for small pox - they are a crucial part of bovine history			0
' people need to be given a reason to want to carry on breeding that cattle			0

traditional @entity3 could disappear from @entity4 for good
experts say the breed of cow that produces it is dying out with just 450 left
farmers claim @entity10 numbers down due to @entity14 regulations
there has also been a *reported* lack of interest from breeders of the cattle
extinction would spell end of @entity22 and ' real ' @entity3 which is only made from pedigree cows
