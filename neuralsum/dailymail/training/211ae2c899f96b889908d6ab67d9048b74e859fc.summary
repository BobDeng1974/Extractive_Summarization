by @entity0 dramatic footage has been released showing the first rescues since the @entity4 landslide that obliterated a community last month			2
the landslide in @entity7 has so far claimed 29 lives , but there was a ray of hope in the form of a woman who was among the first rescued , winched to safety with the only possession she has left ... a painting of a wolf			1
@entity19 , from @entity20 , a woman of @entity22 faith , can be seen clutching the painting , which she claims represents the spirit animal that helped keep her alive during the fatal landslide			1
like many others , her house was completely leveled , but she was luckily saved by rescue crew member @entity28			2
the incredible footage shows mr @entity28 saving ms @entity19 , only to save the painting which coincidentally floated past them at the time of rescue			1
according to ms @entity19 , the painting bobbed on the surface of the muddy water and floated right next to her while she waited for rescue			1
@entity28 hands the painting to another worker : @entity19 saw the painting bob over towards her in the water just before her rescue , and considered this a sign from her creator that she was saved @entity19 is led away to safety by her saviour @entity28 , who also saved her wolf painting she believes that the appearance of the painting was no coincidence			1
ms @entity19 said : ' it 's a @entity67 night warrior , and the title of the painting is " @entity70 "			1
' for me it was sort of a sign that the @entity59 was protecting us and that we were going to make it out of there			0
' seeing it float up there , when everything else was matchsticks let me know that we were going to make it through this thing			0
' @entity19 believes that her spirit animal , the wolf , was the reason for her rescue , as it gave her strength throughout the ordeal ms @entity19 and her eventual saviour mr @entity28 have since been able to meet for the first time since the rescue , in which @entity28 helped to preserve the painting			1
mr @entity28 said : ' if that 's the first dot in reconnecting and building her life , i 'm glad we were able to do that			1
' @entity101 events have been redoubled since the event ahead of forecasts of returning showers that could exacerbate rescue conditions			0
@entity28 and @entity19 meet for the first time since the landslide destroyed her entire home except for her one possession mr @entity28 was happy to have saved the painting , even if it was only a small possession , saying : ' if that 's the first dot in reconnecting and building her life , i 'm glad we were able to do that ' since the event , 13 people have been registered as missing and 29 have been declared officially dead			1
the landslide struck on march 22 , after a rain soaked hillside collapsed with no warning above the north side of the @entity121 , which released a torrent of mud that washed over a state highway and three dozen houses on the outskirts of the town of @entity20			0
officials are now worried that in the light of slightly warmer weather snow on the hilltops could melt , causing fresh water to stream into the @entity121 , possibly adding to floods and making search and rescue efforts even harder			2
the hillsides near the scene of the mudslide are now almost barren , because of the sheer power of the unexpected torrent that also levelled many parts of the community capt. @entity143 , of the @entity144 : search efforts have been redoubled to take advantage of the three - day dry spell , ahead of expected showers that could make the search and rescue conditions worse some sections of the slide area are already under 25 feet of water and are believed to contain more human remains			2
there is also speculation that the area could be submerged by more than 100 feet of water within three to four weeks without a wider channel to divert the partially dammed river			0
@entity160 , an area fire chief acting as the head of operations for the east side of the disaster zone , said : ' there 's a lot of snow left on the mountains surrounding the valley			0
' ( @entity170 ) an aerial view of the mudslide which has so far claimed 29 lives with another 13 missing			0
the mudslide covered both a local highway in the @entity7 area , and levelled around three dozen houses on the outskirts of the town of @entity20 ' we 're going to start facing runoff issues from that in the very near future			0
' president @entity185 has approved the state 's request for a major disaster declaration for the slide , making federal relief assistance available to individuals , households and businesses impacted by the tragedy			0
twenty - six of those killed in the landslide have been identified , and authorities are still working to identify the three remaining confirmed fatalities .			0
