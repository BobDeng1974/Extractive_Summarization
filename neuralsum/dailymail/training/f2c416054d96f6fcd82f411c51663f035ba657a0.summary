people talk about a bird 's - eye view , but one animal - lover was intrigued to see the world from a squirrel 's perspective			0
attaching a piece of bread to a @entity10 , @entity9 resident @entity8 wanted to see if an inquisitive creature would run off while the camera was recording			1

scampering over to the @entity10 from a nearby tree , the squirrel sniffs around for a few seconds before nudging the foreign object to try and see if it is a danger			1

while inspecting its latest find , the squirrel inadvertently captures footage of mr @entity8 waiting below the tree in the hope his camera will be returned			2
leisurely stroll : the squirrel making its way over to the camera sniffing about : the squirrel gets a whiff of the slice of bread attached to the camera what a tease : camera owner mr @entity8 watches on as the squirrel makes its way up the tree eventually , after deciding the @entity10 is n't edible after all , the squirrel lets it drop to the floor and back into the hands of its rightful owner			1
luckily , as seen in the video , the camera was nâ€™t damaged in the drop			0
all it needed was a quick blow on the lens to clear away the dust and it was back in usable condition .			0
