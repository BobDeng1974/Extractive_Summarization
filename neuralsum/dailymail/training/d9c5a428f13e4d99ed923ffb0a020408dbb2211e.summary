@entity0 may have been leading against @entity1 with just minutes of the game to go but damning statistics from sunday 's @entity5 encounter suggest the @entity6 were lucky to come away from @entity7 with a point			1
@entity1 defender @entity9 towered above the @entity0 defence to power home a header to rob @entity14 's men of three points deep into nine minutes of injury time			1
the @entity6 responded swiftly to @entity18 's opener as @entity19 levelled a minute later before taking the lead courtesy of a neat finish from @entity22 only to lose the match at the death			2
@entity9 climbs highest to score with his head and claim an injury - time point for @entity1 against @entity0 the @entity1 defender punches the air after snatching victory from @entity0 deep into injury time at @entity31 @entity18 shoots through a crowd of bodies in the area to give @entity1 a 1 - 0 lead against @entity0 @entity0 defender @entity19 beats @entity9 in the air to equalise for the @entity6 shortly before half - time @entity22 puts the ball through the legs of @entity1 goalkeeper @entity40 to give @entity0 the lead however , while the sight of @entity44 and @entity45 ducking as @entity9 rose through the air to level will disappoint @entity0 fans , the post-match stats will be more of a concern			1
from goalkeeper @entity50 having to deal with 27 shots to frontman @entity52 doing more defensive work than four of @entity0 's five defenders , the @entity6 put in a laboured performance on @entity7 and will need to improve ahead of their @entity57 clash against @entity58			2
@entity0 defenders per @entity45 and @entity44 both ducked as @entity9 powered home a header @entity62 may have been all smiles after going ahead but statistics from the game make for grim reading @entity0 faced more shots ( 27 ) on sunday than they have in any other @entity5 game for 11 years			2
the @entity6 have dropped 11 points from winning positions in the @entity5 this season			0
they only dropped nine in the entirety of the 2013/14 campaign			0
@entity52 won more tackles ( 3 ) against @entity1 than @entity19 , @entity45 , @entity44 and @entity75 combined ( 1 )			0
@entity0 forward @entity52 won more tackles against @entity1 than the @entity6 defence combined @entity0 's 35 per cent share of possession at @entity31 was their lowest since @entity80 began gathering stats 11 years ago			1
the @entity83 club have managed just one win against the @entity5 's top seven sides since last @entity86			0
the full record reads : @entity88 l d l @entity89 @entity0 have not won an away game in which they have conceded since january ( when they claimed a 2 - 1 victory against @entity92 ) .			0

@entity0 conceded an injury - time @entity9 header to draw at @entity1
the @entity6 had led at @entity31 through *striker* @entity22
damning stats suggest @entity14 's side were *fortunate* to take a point
