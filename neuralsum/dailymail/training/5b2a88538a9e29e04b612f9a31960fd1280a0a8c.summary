portrait of an elephant seal , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 @entity40 - headed flying - fox drinking behaviour			1
they swoop low , skimming the water with their belly			2
they then lick their wet fur as they fly and continue licking when perched nearby			2
such behaviour usually occurs at dusk and night but when the temperature reaches 35 Â° c and above , they will also drink during the day survival of the fittest ! it was an overcast , wet and miserable morning as photographer @entity56 crawled commando - style across the wet beach on @entity59 , off the southern tip of the @entity61 of @entity62 to capture two oystercatcher chicks ( family @entity64 ) battle endlessly , neither one wanting to give in to the other rainforest dragon 's ( @entity68 ) steady gaze , @entity70 and @entity71 , 2006 ( pictured left ) and a @entity73 courtship display ( pictured right ) , @entity74 , 2008 @entity76 darter with bream was heading to the shore in @entity79 , @entity80 , to deal with its catch			1
@entity82 , 2013 the beautiful courtship dance of black - winged stilts captured in @entity31 , @entity32 , began with the female stilt ( @entity85 ) , on the right , clearing the little sand mound by picking up and tossing away any extraneous sticks			1
she then stooped forward , inclining her whole body , which immediately attracted the male			0
the male circled the female as she slowly and gracefully spun around on the spot			0
@entity33 , 2013 when fruit of silkwood flowers open , they display unsubtle yet harmonious colours			0
these colours attract fruit - eating birds which then disperse the seeds			1

@entity110 , 2012 the small fruiting bodies of bird 's nest fungi ( @entity115 sp. ) are completely closed when first formed			2
then the top crumbles away , leaving a cup containing spore - bearing tissues called peridioles			2
when raindrops land in the cup , the peridioles are propelled into the air , dispersing the spores			0

@entity152 , 2013 little egret grabs little fish as the sun set over @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity32 , this little egret ( @entity159 ) was hunting small fish trapped in the tidal pools on the sand flats			0
it was running and jumping after its prey in an almost feverish excitement , knowing that there was n't much light left			0
@entity169 , 2013 this macro photo of a mosquito ( family @entity172 ) was taken in a small rockpool in my garden in @entity176 , @entity109			2
@entity177 , 2010 fungi in the mist			0
each morning for a fortnight , a cluster of fungi would erupt out of a pile of woodchips in @entity185 on @entity186 at the @entity187 , @entity32 , but wither up and be gone a few hours after sunrise			0
@entity189 , 2013 @entity190 spoonbill preening in @entity150 , @entity80			0
