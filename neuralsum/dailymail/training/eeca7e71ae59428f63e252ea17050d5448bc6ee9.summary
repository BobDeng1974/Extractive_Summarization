by @entity0 @entity1 eats at @entity2 's , watches @entity3 on @entity4 , messed up her first driving lesson , can barely say a sentence without the word ' like ' in it and talks with teenage wonder about earning a million pounds			1
in other words , she sounds like a typical 18 - year - old , and that might be the most refreshing thing about this girl who has taken the @entity19 women 's game by storm			1
@entity21 hit : @entity22 's @entity1 has taken the @entity19 women Â¿ s game by storm impact : @entity27 shows off at @entity28 the swing that has propelled her to near the top of the women 's game for how often are we left cold by these teenage prodigies who sound like they 've missed out their fun years of development altogether and are really about 30 ? @entity27 , by contrast , has a warmth about her and a no - nonsense approach to her sport that will serve her well when the difficult moments arrive			1
' when it comes to golf i 've always thought , " hit it , find it , hit it again " , ' she said			0
' who taught me that ? me			0
why would you want to make it more complicated ? it has served me well so far , and i ca n't see me changing			0
' why would you ? just over a year on from her debut as a professional and she has had one win , five second places , one third on the @entity56 in the @entity57 , one top 10 in a major and was a star of @entity19 's @entity60 win last year			1
there 's a lot to be said for ' hit it , find it , and hit it again '			2
focused : @entity1 hits from a bunker during a practice round at @entity28 on wednesday but there 's a lot more to @entity27 's game than that , beginning with a ferocious work ethic that frequently sees her dropped off by her dad at @entity76 first thing in the morning and picked up late at night			1
presumably he will be glad when she can take herself , although it does n't appear her skills in that particular driving department will be catching up to those on the driving range any time soon			0
' it was n't a good start to get told off on my first lesson ! ' she giggled			0
' i was looking at the dials and thinking , " that 's ok , i 'm going about 30mph " , but it turned out i was looking at the rev counter			2
in reality i was doing about 60 ! ' as for the golf , she 's moved effortlessly into the fast lane			2
the current leader of the @entity96 , she 's ranked in the world 's top 35 already and revelled in a duel with @entity99 and @entity100 in a recent @entity56 tournament			1
she did n't win , but was appreciative of @entity100 's comments afterwards			1
picture this : @entity99 practices her putting on the 18th in front of ( left to right ) @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity1 and @entity108 ' she said to me she hoped i got my card to play in @entity57 because i fully deserved it , ' said @entity1			0
' it was lovely to hear			0
i thought i showed i could play among the best at the @entity114 in april ( the first women 's major of each season ) but @entity118 's comments told me i had been accepted , and were a huge boost to my confidence			1
' i 'm just living my dream right now			0
i never wanted to go to college in @entity57 because to me that was taking me away from my perfect job for four years			0
' that 's the approach she will adopt as the leading home hope when the @entity127 gets under way at @entity28			2
sometimes when she 's in the rough , @entity27 will wonder what her hero , @entity131 , would do			1
the @entity133 announced himself to the world at @entity28 in 1976 with his unforgettable runner - up finish and , on the same stage , we await to see whether another precocious talent can leave a similar , indelible mark .			0
