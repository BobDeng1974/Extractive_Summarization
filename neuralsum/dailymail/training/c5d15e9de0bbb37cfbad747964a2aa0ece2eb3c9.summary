@entity0 is only three - and - a - half hours by express train from the @entity3 capital , @entity4 , but it could be a different country			1
in a city of @entity8 , not @entity9 architects , it would be easy to forget you are in @entity3			1
@entity12 , it is said , hated @entity4			2
and when he founded his modern capital at the mouth of the @entity16 in 1703 , he looked to the @entity17 for inspiration			2
in the course of the next 100 years , his court built the city 's magnificent baroque and neo-classical palaces			1
colours and shapes : @entity0 boasts grand landmarks such as the @entity27 on @entity28 today , visitors flock to the @entity30 , with its sombre @entity31 , the massive @entity32 and the @entity33 , that treasure trove of @entity36 art ( look out for its army of cats , introduced by @entity39 in 1745 to keep the resident rats at bay )			2
the @entity42 should not be missed			2
from 1710 to the revolution , it was home to four generations of this colourful family			0
they included @entity49 , one of @entity51 's art buyers ; @entity52 , a lover of @entity54 ( the shape of the @entity57 perfume bottle is said to be based on his hip flask ) ; and @entity59 , who once gave the ballerina @entity60 a silk dress studded with rubies and diamonds for her performance in @entity66			1
it was the same @entity59 who fed @entity69 cookies laced with cyanide			0
art of the matter : @entity73 - the former @entity74 of the @entity75 - is one of the world 's great galleries above all , @entity0 - built on 42 islands and spanned by hundreds of bridges — is best experienced on foot			1
@entity82 noted on his visit there in 1867 : ' i feel as if i could and should be content to do nothing for many days but roam about it			0
' stroll along the pastel - coloured @entity89 as days lengthen into @entity91 ( where from around may to the end of july , it never gets darker than twilight ) , and watch the bridges open to allow ships through to the @entity97			0
then , the city is rent in two , making access to the other side impossible - ' and providing a convenient excuse for errant husbands ' , my guide says wryly			1
by day , enjoy vistas that inspired @entity106 ( ' i love thee , @entity109 's bold creation ' )			1
@entity0 is undergoing a beautification process , with restorations and smart new apartments constructed behind old facades			0
it boasts the fabulous @entity115 opera house , a new concert hall , @entity3 's largest privately - owned contemporary art museum and , in the 19th century general staff building , a natty new wing for the @entity33			1
an imperial wonder : the decor and fittings within the @entity33 are as impressive as the art on its wide walls meanwhile , @entity126 owner @entity125 has bought @entity12 's historic navy warehouses on @entity129 island and , with girlfriend @entity130 , plans to restore them for use as a multi-purpose cultural complex , slated for completion in 2018			1
on the bling front , @entity0 remains some way behind @entity4			0
but that , too , is being addressed			0
designer shops fill the former market of @entity140 , and expensively elegant department stores , such as the new @entity142 , tempt the average citizen with goods he or she could n't possibly afford			1
meanwhile , hip restaurants and bars with names such as @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 and @entity152 are mushrooming in lofts and the old court stables area - our own @entity155 was one of the first foreign celebrity chefs to make his mark in the city with his @entity8 - themed eatery			1
this is where you can find the fabled @entity165 , elegantly draped and heeled , their porsches double - parked outside			0
@entity168 splendour : the city 's buildings - such as the @entity171 - look even grander in winter how different from my first visit , in the bad ol ' days of @entity175			1
in the @entity176 , i was billeted in the dour @entity177			0
today , visitors can enjoy quasi-imperial opulence			0
@entity180 ( @entity181 ) has taken over the @entity182 and created a magnificent heritage wing ; and @entity184 has given the @entity185 ( where @entity186 had planned , somewhat prematurely , to hold his victory dinner ) a facelift			0
driving along the @entity16 , i passed what looked like a 19th - century warehouse , romantically lit by moonlight			0
sated by so much grandeur , i thought it would make an industrial - chic alternative to the lavish hotel scene			2
' that ? ' said my guide , incredulously			0
' it is the oldest - serving prison in @entity3 ! ' @entity200 is the charm of @entity0 that even its prison exerts a certain allure			1
from the outside , at least			0
@entity205 ( 020 7666 1244 , www.regent-holidays.co.uk ) has four nights at the @entity208 from £ 970pp , including @entity210 flights and private transfers .			2

@entity3 's second city is *increasingly* alive with chic bars and fashion stores
@entity126 owner @entity125 is behind a new cultural complex
the city is famously blessed with *summer* nights where the *sun* barely sets
