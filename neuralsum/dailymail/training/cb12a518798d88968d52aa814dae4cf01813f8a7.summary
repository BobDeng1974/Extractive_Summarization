@entity0 has backed the latest measures introduced to improve concussion management in rugby union and warned that failure to implement them could have serious consequences for a player ’s health			1
the @entity10 and @entity11 full back — speaking on wednesday at a @entity13 event to promote their restart charity — has personal experience of concussion , having been knocked out several times in the early part of his career , and had an aerial collision in last season ’s @entity23 quarter - final which left him unconscious for several minutes			2
the @entity13 , along with the @entity26 and @entity27 , recently launched an online education module which all players , coaches and referees must sit , and @entity0 says the more awareness that can be raised the better			1
@entity10 full back @entity0 is man - handled by @entity35 players during their @entity23 match the @entity11 squad member for the @entity38 has backed new concussion measures @entity0 takes a high ball for @entity10 on october 18 ‘ concussion is a subject that people are now talking about across the world but we still do n’t know enough about it , ’ he said			1
‘ we do know that just shrugging it off and playing on can have a very detrimental effect on your body in the long run			2
that ’s what we need to highlight to everyone in order to stop people saying , “ just get on with it ” or “ stop being soft ”			2
‘ people need to understand that when someone ’s had a serious head knock they need to be looked after			1
they do n’t want to be visiting someone in hospital in a wheelchair or a vegetative state			0
‘ it took me having a few knocks and having the symptoms — which are horrible ; like feeling distant from people , feeling sick , head rushes , feeling asleep all the time , aversion to loud music — to really read up and learn more about it			1
now if i take a few jibes from people i do n’t care			2
your health is the most important thing			0
i did n’t want to finish my rugby career at 24 - 25			0
’ the @entity26 say their motivation for introducing the new measures is based on a determination to improve player welfare — not a reaction to a multi-million dollar settlement in the @entity80 paid out to retired stars with dementia — and coaches insist they would never interfere with decisions made by club medics			1
the full back , in action during @entity10 win over @entity35 , was knocked out in last year 's @entity23 ‘ even the top scientists do n’t know about this so until we do we do need to err on the side of caution , ’ said @entity0 , 26 , who is in the @entity11 squad for the @entity93 autumn series			1
‘ if parents and kids see someone knocked out and carrying on it sends a terrible message			0
‘ but what ’s happened in the media has made a big impact			0
we ’re getting a better understanding			0
‘ the coaches understand it too			0
they are ex-players who used to go back on but they understand now if someone is knocked out they stay off			0
