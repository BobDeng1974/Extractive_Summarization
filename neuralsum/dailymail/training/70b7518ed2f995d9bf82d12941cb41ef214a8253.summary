@entity1 's curiosity rover has spotted a unique round rock on the red planet			1
the perfectly spherical formation was found close to another rock resembling a traffic light			1
however , @entity1 claims that rather than evidence of @entity10 sporting achievement , the 1cm sphere actually shows off a unique weather effect on @entity10			1
@entity1 said it was likely an example of @entity10 concretion , the process of compacting and hardening a mass of matter the discovery follows another intriguing image that showed an almost perfectly round rock on the @entity16 ( shown )			1

within the newly forming sedimentary rock on @entity10 , pores are inevitably created and minerals seep into those pores , gradually building up an erosion - resistant mass. over time , the soft sedimentary rock is eroded away , leaving a perfectly spherical mass. according to @entity42 scientists based at @entity1 's @entity43 ( @entity43 ) in @entity44 , @entity45 , the ball is n't as big as it looks and isapproximately one centimeter wide			1
@entity1 said it was probably an example of @entity10 concretion , the process of compacting and hardening a mass of matter , according to @entity50			1
other examples of concretions have been found on the @entity10 surface before			2
for example , the tiny haematite concretions , or ' blueberries ' , observed by @entity10 rover opportunity in 2004			1
the ' ball ' is the latest in a long line of mystery spots on @entity10			1
last week a ' traffic light ' was spotted			1
in the image , a set of three large rocks - admittedly with a larger fourth one as well - are stacked on top of each other			0
they bear a striking resemblance to traffic lights on @entity70			0
but it 's highly unlikely this same feature was built by a martian civilisation			0
the discovery of @entity10 clusters , known as ' blueberries ' , a decade ago provided some of the first evidence of liquid water on the red planet			2
this incredible close up , taken by the @entity82 , reveals these spheres embedded in @entity10 rock like blueberries in a muffin			2
the rover 's top speed is 1.5 inches ( 3.8 centimetres ) per second			0
curiosity is the fourth rover to visit @entity10			1
it took around seven minutes to land on the @entity10			2
the rover is fitted with 17 cameras			0
it weighs about the same as a @entity95 at approximately 900kg ( 2,000lbs )			0
scientists considered 60 possible landing sites before deciding on @entity98			0
the image was shot from the six - foot ( 1.8 metre ) high , left - hand side mast cam on the @entity101			0
it was the 753rd day the rover has been exploring the red planet			0
the rock was spotted in the image by space video journalist @entity107 from @entity109 who runs a @entity111 channel called @entity112			2
' i saw this one and i thought ' hang on , that looks a bit strange '			0
i think it looks like a traffic light			1
' it is hard to tell how big it would be without any point of reference , but i would estimate it was about 12 inches [ 30.5cm ]			0
' i posted it on the internet and people said they thought it looked like a set of traffic lights too - although some people did say it looked like a totem pole			2
' curiosity is currently at the base of @entity134 , which has been the target for the mission since it landed just over two years ago			0
the curiosity rover has spotted a rock that looks like traffic lights on @entity10 ( shown in the red ring in this image )			1
@entity142 - based @entity1 is yet to comment on the latest discovery			1
the finding highlights just how weird and wonderful some of the rock formations on @entity10 can be the ' traffic lights ' ( left ) were spotted by @entity101 ( right ) on its way to the base of @entity134 , a geologically fascinating region that could explain how @entity10 lost its wet and habitable environment			1
other people have said the strange looking rock resembles a totem pole the area is geologically fascinating as it contains layers that may provide an insight into the history of @entity10			2
and , scientists hope the region might reveal how and why @entity10 lost what was once thought to be a habitable environment , with water flowing on its surface			2
this , in turn , may provide answers on the future of @entity70			0
yesterday @entity168 's first mission to @entity10 , the @entity170 's @entity169 , arrived at @entity10 and released its first image ( shown ) of the red planet 's surface			0
' @entity174 ? keep in touch			0
i 'll be around ' the team for the orbiter tweeted on its arrival			0

the finding highlights how unusual rock formations on @entity10 can be
previous find was shaped like a traffic light
