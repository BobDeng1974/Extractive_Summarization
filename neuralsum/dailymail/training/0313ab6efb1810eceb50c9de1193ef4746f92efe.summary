the @entity0 has said from the beginning of @entity4 @entity3 's temporary appointment that it 's not his job to be the face of the administration 's efforts to stop an @entity10 epidemic from breaking out on @entity12 's shores			1
rather , the president 's spokesman has said , @entity3 's position is a managerial one , and his sole responsibility is ' coordinating the whole - of - government approach			1
' ' he has performed very well in that task , ' press secretary @entity20 said today			2
the fruits of his labor are ' already being felt , at the @entity0 and across the government , ' the @entity23 flak added			1
but since accepting the job 11 days ago , it 's unclear from the outside looking in what it is that @entity3 has brought to the proverbial table			1
so far , the government 's ' coordination ' with @entity10 affected states appears to be just as ham - handed as it was before @entity3 came on , reporters noted at yesterday 's press briefing			1
what @entity3 gets paid to do is still unclear as there is no evidence he 's actually coordinated anything the federal government 's chaotic approach to managing the health crisis has not eroded the public 's belief that the government will successfully keep an @entity10 outbreak at bay , but a @entity58 poll released this morning shows that many @entity12 do not think it is doing a ' good job			1
' ' it ’s a theater of the absurd			0
it ’s laughable , ' dr. @entity62 , a professor of medicine and biomedical engineering and director of the @entity66 at @entity67 , told the @entity69			0
@entity62 , who the @entity69 characterized as having ' much experience ' in @entity71 , said the invisibility of @entity3 plus the nuances of the health care system had created confusion			1
when the @entity0 tapped @entity3 to manage the execution of it 's @entity10 prevention strategy , he was billed as the adult in the room			1
having served as two vice presidents ' chief of staff , he was lauded by the administration and its allies as having the type of organizational skills necessary to coordinate a government - wide effort			0
however conservatives immediately began to question @entity3 's credentials , particularly the fact that he had never handled a health crisis before			1
other red flags began to pop up almost immediately			0
the newly announced @entity23 adviser accepted the critical position on a friday but did not officially start work until the following wednesday for untold reasons			0
though he was not technically on the job the first five days after president @entity23 named him as the administration 's @entity10 czar , he did visit the @entity0 just hours later			1
the following day he met with @entity0 chief of staff @entity100 and other administration officials			2
yet he skipped an all - hands on deck meeting that saturday in the @entity44 that was deemed important enough for the president to cancel previously scheduled campaign events that afternoon to attend			0
the next monday he was absent from a conference call @entity109 head @entity108 held with reporters to explain the agency 's new ' tiered ' risk system for evaluating @entity10 threats			2
and even through he had officially been on the government payroll for two days , he did not appear before a congressional committee last friday that convened under special circumstances to demand answers from the administration after a second nurse who treated now - deceased @entity10 patient @entity120 came down with the violent virus			2
it was @entity108 who was served up as the administration 's sacrificial lamb at the hearing , just as it was @entity108 who announced yesterday the government 's new guidelines for the voluntary quarantining of health care workers returning from @entity71			1
and today it was @entity23 who took the lead in showcasing the government 's actions			1
before jetting off for an evening campaign event in @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity23 gave a statement to the press , during which he praised health care workers risking their lives to treat @entity10 patients in @entity147 , @entity148 and @entity149			2
today it was president @entity23 who took the lead in showcasing the government 's actions to fight @entity10 when again asked by a reporter yesterday what specific areas of the @entity10 response are under @entity3 's authority , as it remains ambiguous , @entity20 again said ' his principal responsibility is a behind - the - scenes role in coordinating the whole - of - government response that the president has directed be implemented to respond to this specific situation			1
' and that means that he will work closely with the @entity109 and @entity168 , other @entity0 officials , to make sure that the @entity10 response is up to the high standards that the president has set , ' @entity20 explained			1
' that has in the past included conversations with state and local officials , and i ’m confident those kinds of conversations will continue			0
' @entity20 then admitted that @entity3 has no plans to meet with elected officials in @entity181 or @entity182 to discuss their mandatory 21 - day quarantines for medical professionals who come in contact with @entity10 carriers			1
he did however cite @entity181 gov. @entity189 's decision to let a nurse who tested negative for @entity10 twice out of government custody as ' evidence that the ongoing coordination between the @entity23 administration and state and local officials continues successfully in this case			1
' what role @entity3 may have played in her release is unknown , as the @entity23 flak refused to give out details about which @entity0 officials were in contact with @entity189 throughout the last several days			1
but is n't it part of @entity3 's job to ' streamline the response all across the country ? ' a reporter asked @entity20			1
the press secretary did n't answer the question directly , opting to zero in his response on the reporters suggestion that a state - by - state approach to containing and preventing @entity10 from spreading could cause ' panic ' among @entity12 who have a limited understanding of the disease			2
at another point in the briefing he said that because of federalism , states and localities are able to implement their own quarantine policies , regardless of what the @entity109 or the @entity0 has suggested			2
what exactly does ebola czar @entity3 do ? ' his principal responsibility is a behind - the - scenes role in coordinating the whole - of - government response that the president has directed be implemented to respond to this specific situation , ' @entity0 press secretary @entity20 said yesterday so , ' what has changed since [ @entity3 ] started his job ? ' a reporter asked @entity20 ' because it appears as though this week there 's more confusion than there was last week , given what we 're seeing in @entity182 and @entity181 , and more differences between how the states are dealing with it			1
' ' i think the record should reflect that mr. @entity3 started one week ago today last wednesday , ' @entity20 told her			0
' and in that time we have seen a significant number of announcements related to the whole - of - government approach that the president has ordered to dealing with the @entity10 situation			2
' admittedly , @entity20 said @entity3 had n't been involved in all of the administration 's policy making given his recent start date , including the requirement that all passengers coming out of @entity71 fly through five specific international airports			1
' but i do think that what you see here is intensive coordination among a range of federal agencies to respond to this very difficult challenge			0
' the @entity0 's vague responses had reporters leaving yesterday 's hour - long briefing just as confused as they were when it began about what it exactly it is that the government is paying @entity3 to do			1
today @entity20 again attempted to talk @entity3 up , saying he ' has been very hard at work in coordinating the whole - of - government approach that the president has mandated			2
' ' that means that @entity3 has arrived here at the @entity0 early in the morning			2
he 's stayed here late at night , ' @entity20 stated			0
@entity3 visited the @entity279 staff in @entity280 last week , and @entity20 confirmed today that he 'll travel to the @entity109 headquarters in @entity282 , @entity283 , in the near future to meet with officials there			0
' i recognize that all of you have not had the chance to see him and talk to him every day but the president certainly has , ' @entity20 revealed			0
@entity3 is ' somebody with extensive management credentials both inside and outside of government ... who is on task and coordinating this very challenging problem , ' the @entity23 flak added			2
he later explained that @entity3 give @entity23 status updates ' regularly			0
' @entity20 pointed out that he attended a meeting on sunday with the president , as did other health and national security advisers			0
' so i guess he 's been here for seven days and he 's seen the president on six of them			0
' this photo , taken sunday , shows nurse @entity306 in an isolation tent at @entity308 in @entity309 , @entity181 , where she was quarantined following her work in @entity71 caring for @entity10 patients despite testing negative for the virus			0
yesterday , she was released after @entity0 administration officials pressured the @entity181 government behind the scenes			2
it 's unclear if @entity3 was involved in that effort one federal agency that the @entity0 does n't appear to have clear coordination with is the @entity321			1
yesterday , army chief of staff , gen. @entity322 , said all soldiers assigned to @entity71 would undergo a mandatory 21 - day quarantine			0
but that will not necessarily be a @entity321 - wide policy , @entity20 told reporters today			0
@entity321 has yet to issue a formal policy that will govern quarantine measures , he said			0
for more information on the military 's plans , @entity20 directed the press to @entity321			0
the administration 's frenzied response to the @entity10 crisis had even sketch comedy show @entity337 , which is notorious for it 's spoofs of the president and other political figureheads , making fun of @entity3 in its latest episode			1
at a fake press conference , the show pointed out in its opening skit that @entity3 had zero experience handling a health crisis before this and suggested that his appointment was a political stunt to help @entity351 win the midterm elections			1
republicans argued as much in the days immediately following his assignment to the high - profile post			0
rep. @entity356 , one of a handful of physicians serving in @entity359 , claimed @entity23 made an ' unserious gesture at an incredibly serious moment			0
' likewise , @entity363 chairman @entity362 of @entity364 said in a statement he ' was glad the president got off the campaign trail to finally focus on @entity10			0
' ' but with this appointment of a czar " with no health background , he just got right back on , ' @entity362 accused .			0

it 's unclear from the outside looking in what it is that @entity376 @entity3 has brought to the table since accepting the job
the @entity0 says ' he has performed very well in that task ' and the ' fruits of his labor are ' already being felt '
but the @entity0 ca n't point to a single thing that @entity3 has actually coordinated
@entity386 said from the beginning that @entity3 was n't the right person to manage the government 's @entity10 efforts because he has no health crisis experience
even @entity337 made fun of him last weekend
