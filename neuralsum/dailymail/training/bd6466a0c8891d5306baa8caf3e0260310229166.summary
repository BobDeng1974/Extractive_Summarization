a @entity1 - run bakery that triggered a discrimination row when it refused to bake a cake with a pro-gay marriage slogan will fight the case in court rather than pay a ' modest ' settlement			1
@entity8 refused in may to bake the cake printed with the words ' support gay marriage '			1
the cake was also to have had pictures of two characters from @entity14 , the name of the group , @entity16 , and the year it was founded , 1998			0
the bakery 's owner , @entity19 , said he should not have to promote a cause he does not believe in			1
mr @entity19 - who is being financially backed by the @entity29 - has refused the compensation request			1
' we ’re continuing to hold to the stand that we took originally because we believe it ’s biblical , we believe it ’s what @entity35 would want us to do , ' he said			2
' we feel that the @entity37 are pursuing us because of our beliefs that marriage is between a man and a woman , ' he said			2
' we also think that if we do cave in to the @entity37 at this point it ’ll put pressure on other citizens who are defending their view of traditional marriage			2
' he said @entity35 's ' purposes will prevail ' as the case unfolds			1
the @entity37 wrote to baking company last month stating that they would be seeking compensation on the grounds of discrimination			0
' biblical stand ' : @entity19 said his family bakery should n't have to promote marriage equality			1
they said on october 27 that mr @entity19 had a week to pay or civil action would be launched			1
the @entity29 says the @entity37 has ' dreamed up ' its case against the bakery			1
' it is simply baffling for a body supposedly working for equality to be threatening a @entity1 family , all because of a cake , ' said spokesman @entity68			0
' @entity69 has taken four months to dream up new grounds on which to pursue the @entity19 family , claiming that they ’ve breached political discrimination laws			0
' he told the @entity74 : ' you ca n't put a price on conscience			0
' @entity69 seems to think that some people 's conscience is worth more than others			0
' mr @entity68 said the bakery had received support from people who do not believe the @entity19 's views , but nevertheless respect his right to voice them			1
he also said thousands of dollars had been raised to support the bakery in its legal fight			2
' this is a @entity90 - verse - @entity89 battle against a state - backed organisation , ' he said			0
in a statement the @entity37 said : ' in its letter the @entity37 stated that they would prefer not to have to litigate these issues and sought an acknowledgement that there has been an unlawful breach of the equality laws and an assurance that this will not be repeated			0
' @entity8 has seven outlets and said it has received community support in its fight in the past the courts have said it is wrong for @entity107 to refuse to serve gay people on grounds of their sexuality			2
judges have also said it is right for @entity107 to be fired from their jobs for refusing to take part in same - sex civil partnership ceremonies or for saying they would not give sex therapy to same - sex couples			0
but the challenge to the @entity1 - run @entity8 is the first likely legal case in which anyone has been told it is against the law to refuse to take part in gay rights publicity campaigns			1
a july @entity127 poll found that six in 10 @entity128 though it was ‘ disproportionately heavy - handed ’ to drag the bakery company to court because of its beliefs .			0

@entity133 bakery wo n't *apologise* or pay settlement for refusing service

@entity37 said it would serve the bakery with a civil action
but bakery owner @entity19 is taking a ' biblical ' stand on the matter
