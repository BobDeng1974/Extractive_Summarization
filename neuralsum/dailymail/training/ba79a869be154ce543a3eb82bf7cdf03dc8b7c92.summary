click here for @entity2 's match report from @entity3 search through the thousands of pages written about @entity6 over the years and you wo n't find much about the value of running and jumping			0
@entity10 's manager has always preferred to talk about rather sophisticated facets of the game			1
as he reflects on perhaps the first significant result of his time at @entity3 , though , @entity13 and his sports science team will have noticed the remarkable numbers attached to @entity19 's stand - out performance against @entity20 on sunday			1
@entity19 is never going to be invisible			1
not when he looks like he does			0
nevertheless anyone who left @entity3 on sunday sensing that the big @entity23 had been ' everywhere ' will be interested to know that he pretty much was			0
@entity19 put in one of his best performances for @entity10 against @entity20 the @entity23 midfielder was signed by former manager @entity27 for £ 27.5million last summer @entity19 's touch map against @entity20 on sunday according to the statistics , @entity19 covered 12.17km during the course of the game , almost a kilometre more than @entity10 's @entity32 , the man next in the list			1
more significantly , @entity19 also completed 70 sprints , a remarkable number for a holding midfield player and more than two @entity10 full backs encouraged by their coach to overlap			1
numbers can be over-used and over-analysed in football			0
some may say that the only statistic that really matters from sunday 's engrossing clash was the 1 - 1 scoreline			0
nevertheless , @entity19 's efforts say everything for his return to physical fitness after a difficult first year at @entity10 and go some way to indicate just why @entity20 's primary playmaker had such a relatively minimal impact on this game			1
clearly designated to shadow @entity53 , @entity19 ensured that the @entity55 midfielder made only three passes in the first 20 minutes and eleven in the whole of the first half			1
prior to the game , @entity53 was the most successful and regular passer of a football in the @entity60			0
' he was fantastic , ' said @entity61 of @entity19			2
' he did a great job on @entity53 for us			0
' it was incredibly helpful when you are trying to stay in a game			0
' @entity19 endured an awful first season at @entity10			1
@entity19 ( left , pictured on sunday ) compared to a look of despair away at @entity70 in 2013 @entity19 ( close to @entity71 against @entity72 in april ) went missing in the big games last season he failed to produce the sort of performances for @entity10 that had made him famous at @entity77 previously @entity78 ( left ) , @entity19 and @entity79 ( right ) were n't deemed ' @entity10 players ' in the summer @entity82 striker @entity81 comfortably skips past @entity19 at the @entity83 the foreign press gave @entity19 no score when @entity10 lost to @entity72 in the @entity86 @entity27 ' big summer signing of 2013 , unfortunately for him he became rather synonymous with the former @entity10 manager 's difficult time at @entity3			1
in the summer , @entity13 suggested to the club 's executive vice-chairman @entity90 that @entity19 be sold			1
' he is not a @entity10 type of player , ' @entity13 told @entity94			2
had injury not intervened , @entity19 would probably be playing his football on loan at @entity98 right now			1
he may never have been seen again in a @entity10 shirt			2
with some belated and overdue fitness , however , has arrived something of the player we used to see at @entity77			2
@entity19 was always technically good enough but it was the energy and physicality of his football that stood out during his time on @entity107 , as well as his habit of scoring important goals			2
last season at @entity3 the @entity23 looked desperately short of confidence			0
it must be said , he rarely looked of the required standard			0
@entity27 perhaps did n't help by talking of the ' best chest trap i have ever seen ' - faint praise , that - but with hindsight maybe it was the debilitating effect of a succession of injuries that prevented @entity19 from reaching the levels of fitness required to play his natural game			1
after the draw at @entity124 , @entity13 conceded that he may have to adapt his own philosophy a little as he continues to learn about @entity127 football			0
' we have to look also for physical talents and maybe that 's our problem , ' said @entity13 in explaining his decision to leave out @entity132			0
' i 'm a coach who is always thinking about creative players but in @entity127 you also need physical bodies in your team and @entity19 is one of these			2
' @entity19 is perhaps slightly more than that but the fact is he may not have played on sunday had others been available yet the way that @entity10 conceded a goal to @entity20 from a set - piece showed just how valuable the 26 - year - old may prove to be			1
@entity10 are not a particularly tall side , especially when players like @entity147 and @entity148 are not in it			2
if you look at the physical attributes of @entity20 and @entity82 , for example , that certainly becomes clear			2
@entity61 wheels away after thundering home @entity19 's parried header equaliser against @entity20 @entity19 scored a super goal breaking from midfield away at @entity124 on monday night @entity19 has @entity20 defender @entity158 turning the wrong way during the 1 - 1 draw at @entity3 on sunday @entity6 has conceded he may need to change his methods as manager of @entity10 @entity19 brings muscle and aerial threat at both ends of the field			1
@entity167 may have scored the equaliser but it was @entity19 's header from a set - piece that served as the vital assist			1
former @entity10 captain @entity173 said : ' for 25 years , @entity10 as an option , not as a rule , would lump the ball forward			0
' people say it 's not the @entity10 way , but i do n't get that			1
' so @entity19 could come in handy			0
@entity147 is 6ft 1in and there might be an option there			0
' you 've got to think about those things going into a game and i 'm sure @entity6 will this season			0
