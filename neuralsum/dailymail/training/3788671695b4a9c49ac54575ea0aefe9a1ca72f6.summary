by @entity0 the fight or flight response is well known , but now scientists have discovered brain cells that control the desire to fight – and mate			0
while researchers found that innate social behaviours like mating and aggression are closely related long ago , this is the first time they have pinpointed specific neurons deep in the brain that trigger them			1
they discovered that it is possible to switch the behaviour of a mouse from ‘ sniffing and mounting ’ to attacking by increasing how strongly the neurons were stimulated			1
brainy breakthrough : for the first time researchers have pinpointed the specific neutrons deep in the hypothalamus of a mouse 's brain ( circled in orange ) that trigger fighting and mating			1
here , nerve fibres ( the yellow lines ) emanate from estrogen receptor - expressing neurons in the hypothalamus ( yellow dots ) that control aggression the researchers discovered the specific neurons responsible for fighting and mating deep in the brain of mice and could switch between the behaviours using pulses of light			1
if the neurons were strongly activated by pulses of light , a male mouse attacked another male or female			1
weaker activation of the same neurons triggered ‘ sniffing and mounting , ’ or mating behaviours			2
the study results suggest that the level of activity within the population of neurons may control the decision between mating and fighting			0
biologist @entity56 led a team at the @entity58 ( @entity58 ) that genetically identified neurons that control aggressive behaviour in the mouse hypothalamus - a structure that lies deep in the brain			0
they managed this by using pulses of light to stimulate the neurons in a method called optogenetics			1
@entity70 uses light emitted by leds mounted to the skull , or deeply implanted optical fires , to control neurons that have been genetically sensitised to light			0
the scientists found that when the neurons were strongly activated by pulses of light a male mouse attacked another male or female			1
however , weaker activation of the same neurons triggered ‘ sniffing and mounting , ’ or mating behaviours			2
a love and a fighter : if the neurons were strongly activated by pulses of light , a male mouse ( pictured ) attacked another male or female			2
however , weaker activation of the same neurons triggered ' sniffing and mounting , ' or mating behaviours they found that they could switch the behaviour of a single animal from mounting to attack by gradually increasing the strength of neuronal stimulation during a social encounter			0
the results of the study , which was published in @entity100 , suggest that the level of activity within the population of neurons may control the decision between mating and fighting			0
the neurons were initially identified because they express a protein receptor for the hormone oestrogen - reinforcing the view that oestrogen plays an important role in the control of male aggression			0
because the human brain contains a hypothalamus that is structurally similar to that in the mouse , these results may be relevant to human behaviour too .			0

scientists from @entity58 pinpointed the specific neutrons responsible for the behaviours in the brains of mice for the first time
they found that it is possible to switch the behaviour of a mouse from ‘ sniffing and mounting ’ to attacking
the researchers managed this by using pulses of light to stimulate the neurons in a method called optogenetics
if the neurons were strongly activated the mouse started fighting and if they were more weakly stimulated it tried to have *sex*
