movie mogul @entity0 raised eyebrows when he skipped the @entity3 premiere of his latest film @entity4 earlier this year			1
but rather than working on his next film , mr @entity0 was in @entity7 visiting the @entity8 , home to more than 120,000 @entity10 who have fled their country here he describes how visiting the camp and talking to the families that call it their home filled him with both hope and heartbreak : film producer @entity0 with wife @entity22 at the @entity8 refugee camp in @entity7 , which is home to 120,000 @entity10 refugees , including children mr @entity0 at his wife visited the camp at the invitation of the @entity28 high commissioner for refugees to create a storytelling project about the plight of the @entity10 refugees who had flooded into @entity7 there are two @entity33 in the world			1
it 's filled with movie theatres , boutiques , markets , and fantastic restaurants			2
two months ago , i found myself walking down the other @entity33 , nicknamed by aid workers , in the middle of the @entity8 refugee camp in @entity7			1
@entity8 is a ramshackle city of tents and containers , home to about 120,000 @entity10 refugees			1
the streets of this @entity33 are lined with makeshift stores			2
where the walkways of its @entity35 namesake are bordered by ethereal street lamps , here electricity is jimmy - rigged and borrowed from street lamps			2
it was incredible to see an improvised pizza - delivery place , a wedding - dress - rental shop , and , my personal favorite , a baklava bakery			2
the bakery was run by a family of mothers , fathers , grandmothers , grandfathers , and grandchildren , and overseen by several brothers			2
they had survived the atrocities across the border			2
while at the camp mr @entity0 visited the baklava bakery of @entity10 refugee @entity73			1
the @entity8 camp is full of shops including a pizza delivery place and a wedding - dress rental shop while in @entity7 , mr @entity0 , pictured , met with @entity78 , who told the film producer that there are about 1.3 million @entity10 who have fled to her country , with 630,000 of them registered as refugees they each had unimaginable stories of heartbreak - their houses had been blown up , they saw men shot right in front of them , mid-sentence , mid-conversation			1
what ’s more , the people who pulled the trigger could equally have been from any side			2
they not only survived , but also endured to re-create their bakery to feed their fellow refugees			2
their pride in their desserts was as tangible as a sculptor ’s in his creation			2
every time i tried to pay for something , a hand would slap me away			2
' what , are you trying to insult us ? eat			2
' whenever i hear someone say ' eat			0
enjoy , ' it reminds me of the way my grandmother spoke to me			0
it reminds me that we are all the same			0
i came to @entity8 and @entity7 to accompany the writer @entity119 and my wife , @entity120 , who , together , had been invited by the @entity28 high commissioner for refugees ( @entity121 ) to create a storytelling project about the plight of the @entity10 refugees who had flooded into @entity7			1
i met with @entity78 and asked her why @entity7 was so generous with its refugee policy			1
according to the @entity78 , there are now about 1.3 million @entity10 in her country with 630,000 of them are registered as refugees			1
she said that her husband , @entity130 , on seeing women and children fleeing danger , felt that there was really no decision to make , it was the right thing to do , and @entity7 will always do the right thing			1
mr @entity0 said that the resilience of children living in the camp is both heartbreaking and uplifting			1
he added : ' what has happened here in this desert has brought them the chance to experience joy again ' as a father , a leader , and a humanitarian , @entity130 opened his doors			0
this is not something we would allow in our country , or in @entity152			1
not on this scale , when the burden on the country ’s infrastructure and services is almost crippling			1
it is the sacrifice of the @entity7 people , and those in @entity10 ’s other neighboring countries — @entity162 , @entity161 , @entity163 — that allows for the survival of the @entity10 refugees			1
@entity78 and i talked about movies , and politics , but most importantly about the importance of education and its potential to transform the @entity173			0
when education comes to the @entity175 , and to young women in particular , and they realize they can be what they want to be , the world will grow different			0
when the women marched against gun violence in @entity181 , the men listened			0
one hopes the same would happen as women take up more prominent positions in @entity175 countries where they are currently oppressed			0
@entity121 briefed us on what was happening inside @entity10 — about the level of the destruction and the violence that has ravaged the country			1
many of the refugees do n’t know any more who it was that attacked their village , who kidnapped their friend , who slaughtered their family , who they were running from			0
the @entity10 army , the @entity201 , @entity202 , @entity203 , splinter groups of any and all of them — there are so many factions in play now			1
every minute of every day unimaginable acts of cruelty , so dark , so grotesque , are being meted out to innocents across great swathes of their beloved country			1
what man does to another man never ceases to amaze me			0
mr @entity0 's wife @entity120 and friend @entity119 enjoy a snack with @entity10 refugee @entity218 and her daughter in the family 's pre-fab caravan			1
miss @entity120 holds a young baby and she and mr @entity119 listen to @entity28 aid workers at the camp talk about the conditions the refugees are facing there i listened with @entity22 and @entity119 to a man who was beaten in front of his family — his wife and young children — for over an hour and a half			1
you could see his mobility had been eviscerated and that a man who needed to be the proud and strong family leader had been brought to his knees by sheer human cruelty			0
@entity119 told me about 11 - year - old @entity78			0
a mortar fell on her house in the middle of the night			0
@entity78 and her five sisters lived , but she is missing a third of her jaw			0
the volunteer medic who attends her had recently run out of painkillers			0
our translator said with despairing wonder , ' how does she sleep at night ? ' i do not know how to answer that question , nor do i know how we can sleep at night , when this is happening			0
each tale we heard , each journey , was more harrowing than the last			0
@entity121 introduced me to a group of young adults learning @entity259 , 10 women on one side , 10 men on the other			0
their favourite actress ? @entity267			0
why ? she is a great actress and had also visited the camp twice , unheralded			1
they love her for her craft , but also for her humanity			0
they told me they identified with characters who did the right thing , the hard thing , to make sure good triumphed over evil			0
then they had a question for me : why , after we told the world that chemical weapons were our line in the sand in the @entity10 conflict , did we do nothing ? @entity292 is their movie star			1
we are their @entity295 , @entity297 , @entity298 , @entity299 : the guys who do the right thing			0
how to explain that after @entity162 and @entity302 , the @entity292 and @entity303 became tired ? that we do not want to see our own sons and daughters in harm ’s way ? the @entity8 camp , which is nicknamed by aid workers as the @entity33 is described by mr @entity0 as a ramshackle city of tents and containers , home to about 120,000 @entity10 refugees the work of the @entity121 is filled with a lot of sacrifice and very little thanks			1
they are building cities in the sand , erecting shelters as quickly as refugees arrive , providing health care , education , water , support , and protection for the millions forced to leave their homes in the biggest humanitarian crisis of our time			0
we visited a camp that had opened two weeks before			1
it was only home to 4,000 refugees			1
sadly , and not so slowly , it will undoubtedly fail to reach its capacity to shelter 120,000 refugees			1
the stories of their various journeys across the border were harrowing - each tale a nightmare			0
but the ' child - safe ' areas in the camp were a source of profound inspiration , and hope			1
here , children who had only weeks ago been too traumatized by their journey to speak , laughed and played openly			2
i watched 10 young kids ( more than 50 per cent of these camps ’ populations are children ) playing soccer with an imaginary ball			2
five against five , screaming and cheering , their imaginations working overtime to create joy in the middle of a desert			0
the resilience of children is both heartbreaking and uplifting			1
what i saw on the faces of those soccer players , i knew i would remember long after everything has faded			0
what has happened here in this desert has brought them the chance to experience joy again			0
the work is n't done , but it ’s a hell of a start .			0
