footballers are critical role models for young men and women in particular			0
' offenders have a right to rehabilitation but @entity0 had been set to return to top flight football when he has shown no remorse for his crime			1

@entity156 , a talk show host on @entity169 , made the comments during a live debate about the issue			0
after criticism from some listeners and rape campaigners , he began this morning 's show by saying sorry			0

the 29 - year - old said : ' i made it clear on several occasions that rape is an abhorrent and inexcusable crime and that women who are victims are in no way to blame			0

i apologise to anybody who was offended by what i said			0
' in his original comments , @entity156 said : ' i think women need to be more aware of a man 's sexual desire that when you 're in that position that you are about to engage in sexual activity there 's a huge amount of energy in the male body , there 's a huge amount of will and intent , and it 's very difficult for many men to say no when they are whipped up into a bit of a storm			0
' and it 's the old adage about if you yank a dog 's tail , then do n't be surprised when it bites you			0
' or you ca n't keep snakes in the garden and think they 'll only bite your neighbours			0
' @entity222 said @entity156 's remarks were the latest example of a public figure making ' ignorant comments '			2
some @entity107 users compared him to a real - life @entity229 - a reference to the @entity169 - based comedy radio presenter 's politically - incorrect comments			0
@entity156 went on to suggest that feminists had ' hijacked ' or ' jumped on ' the debate and appear to be ' anti-men '			0

mr @entity125 and @entity0 both had intercourse with the girl , and at one point two other men tried to film it though a window			2

april 23 : the victim is named for the first time online by supporters of @entity0 , who begin bombarding her with abuse that police will later compare to ' virtual @entity278 '			2
