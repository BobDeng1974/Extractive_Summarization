@entity1 mp @entity0 said a vote for independence would be humiliating for the prime minister @entity5 could be forced to resign as prime minister if @entity7 votes to leave the @entity8 , a senior conservative mp has warned			1
former @entity1 leadership contender @entity0 said that a @entity10 vote in next month ’s referendum would be such a ‘ humiliation ’ , he would have to consider stepping down			1
mr @entity5 has insisted he has no intention of quitting , even if he presides over the end of the 300 - year - old union			1
but asked if the prime minister would have to go , mr @entity0 told the @entity18 : ‘ that ’s his call			2
it will be particularly humiliating for him			0
‘ it would be a humiliating point for any prime minister to have lost a part of the @entity8 , no doubt about that			0
’ @entity26 , professor of politics at @entity28 , added : ‘ a yes vote would destroy @entity5 ’s place in the history books			2
‘ he would become known as the prime minister who gambled on keeping @entity7 in the union and lost his gamble			2
‘ ( it would be ) very difficult in those circumstances to see how he could continue for any very great length of time			0
’ mr @entity0 , a former @entity1 home affairs spokesman who stood against mr @entity5 for the party leadership in 2005 , said if @entity7 votes to remain in the @entity8 and gets more devolved powers there would be a knock - on effect for @entity45			1
he said there would have to be a ' more federal answer for the @entity8 ' and this would mean ' at the absolute minimum , @entity45 votes for @entity45 measures '			0
mr @entity5 has denied that his position would be untenable if @entity7 voted to leave the @entity8 in the vote on september 18			1
after the @entity54 won a majority in the @entity56 in 2011 , he agreed to hold the referendum on independence			0
earlier this year when asked if he would resign in the event of a @entity10 vote , mr @entity5 said : ‘ no and i think it is very important people understand that because it is not my name or anyone else 's name on the ballot paper			1
‘ of course , i want to see @entity7 stay in the @entity8 but i faced a choice in 2011 when the @entity7 nationalists were elected to run the @entity7 government			0
‘ do you have a referendum or do you have some massive fight with them saying “ no , no you ca n't possibly have this choice ” ? ' @entity5 risks going down in the history books as the prime minister who lost @entity7 and may have to consider resigning , it was suggested on a @entity18 documentary aired last night mr @entity5 added : ‘ i thought the right thing to do , and this was backed by the other parties at the time , and i remain of the view it was the right thing to do , was to give the @entity7 people a fair , legal and decisive referendum			1
that 's what will happen			0
‘ it was absolutely the right decision			0
you have to decide the prior question as it were - does @entity7 want to stay in the @entity8 or separate itself from the @entity8 ? ‘ once you have settled that question , then you can properly engage with future acts of devolution - on which again i have a pretty good track record			2
