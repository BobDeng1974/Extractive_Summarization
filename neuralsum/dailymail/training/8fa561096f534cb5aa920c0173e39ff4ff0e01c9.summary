by @entity0 published : 10:36 est , 30 october 2012 updated : 15:15 est , 30 october 2012 the largest lunar dark spot , a massive 1,800 mile wide crater known as the ' @entity4 ' , may be a scar from a giant cosmic impact , researchers believe			1
a @entity8 team say the giant cosmic impact created a magma sea more than a thousand miles wide and several hundred miles deep			1
these findings could help explain why the moon 's near and far sides are so very different from one another , the team say			1
the two sides of the moon : researchers now believe @entity17 , the largest of the three massive impact basins shown here , was formed by a massive cosmic collision ' our discovery provides the first compositional evidence of this idea , which could be confirmed by future lunar sample return missions , such as @entity26 , a proposed @entity28 mission that would send an unmanned probe to collect lunar dirt and return it to @entity31 , ' lead study author @entity32 , a planetary scientist at the @entity33 in @entity34 , @entity8 , told @entity35			1
' the neighboring @entity31 likely experienced similar - sized impacts around the same period , ' @entity32 added			0
' it would have had a great effect on the onset of @entity31 's continental crust formation and the beginning of life			0
' scientists analyzed @entity4 , or the @entity4 , a dark spot on the near side of the moon more than 1,800 miles ( 3,000 kilometers ) wide			2
researcher already know the near side of the moon , the side that always faces @entity31 , is quite different from the far side ( which is often called the dark side , even though it does get sunlight )			0
previous studies have found widespread plains of volcanic rock called ' maria ' cover nearly a third of the near side , but only a few maria are seen on the far one			0
now scientists in @entity8 say that a giant collision may also explain the moon 's two - faced nature , one that gave rise to the @entity4			1
the size of the asteroid involved is estimated at 180 miles in diameter , and it is believed it hit the moon 's surface 3.9billion years ago			1
researchers analyzed the composition of the moon 's surface using data from the @entity8 lunar orbiter @entity79 / @entity78			2
these data revealed that a low - calcium variety of the mineral pyroxene is concentrated around @entity4 , the @entity4 , and large impact craters such as the @entity83			0
this type of pyroxene is linked with the melting and excavation of material from the lunar mantle , and suggests the @entity4 is a leftover from a cataclysmic impact			0
this collision would have generated ' a 3,000 - kilometer ( 1,800 - mile ) wide magma sea several hundred kilometers in depth , ' the red points show high low - calcium pyroxene concentrations , discovered through data mining of @entity79 's spectral data archive , and are signs of a cosmic impact			1
the researchers believe collisions large enough to create @entity4 and the moon 's other giant impact basins would have completely stripped the original crust on the near side of the moon			2
the crust that later formed there from the molten rock left after these impacts would differ dramatically from that on the far side , explaining why these halves are so distinct			0
the scientists detailed their findings online oct. 28 in the journal @entity117 .			0

@entity8 team say the giant cosmic impact created a magma sea more than a thousand miles wide and several hundred miles deep
theory explains why moon 's near and far sides are so different
