by @entity0 published : 09:05 est , 9 december 2013 @entity2 : 10:22 est , 9 december 2013 a 10 - year - old girl died needlessly after a catalogue of serious blunders at a much - criticised hospital			1
@entity7 had suffered from epilepsy since she was one and and died of a heart attack when staff at @entity11 were unable to stop her fitting			1
an inquest into @entity7 ’s death heard that junior doctors were unable to administer drugs to the her because they were past their use by date			1
@entity7 , 10 , was taken to @entity11 after she had an epileptic fit			1
due to a catalogue of errors , doctors failed to stop her fitting and she suffered a heart attack			1
she died two days later no senior doctors were on the ward after 5pm and the on - call locum consultant chose to stay at home when he was contacted			1
@entity30 ’ court was told @entity7 suffered an epileptic seizure at her school but it had been stopped thanks to an anti-seizure drug			2
she was rushed to @entity11 where she suffered a second seizure soon after arriving at 4.20pm on october 12 last year			0
a series of errors meant it was not controlled			0
@entity7 suffered a heart attack at 6.05pm and stopped breathing for 14 minutes			1
she was rushed to @entity39 , @entity40 , but died two days later			1
the coroner recorded a narrative verdict , meaning she could not attribute the death to a named individual			1
@entity7 's father , @entity45 said : ' there is a void in our understanding of how a situation as dire as this was allowed to exist in a hospital			1
' he told the inquest he disputed hospital records and believes his daughter 's seizure could have lasted for as long as an hour and 45 minutes			2
after her heart attack , @entity7 was taken to @entity39 in @entity40 but doctors there were unable to save her			1

’ coroner @entity85 was told of the hospital ’s failings which let @entity7 down			1
these included an ‘ inexperienced ’ medic struggling to mix a dose of the necessary drug which had been successful in stopping @entity7 ’s seizure when she was at school			0
junior doctors on the ward decided against using three other types of drug after the initial treatment failed because they were past their use by dates			2
when @entity7 was at @entity104 hospital there were no senior doctors on the ward and an on - call consultant was contacted but decided to stay at home but investigations later concluded that they should have attempted to use the drugs anyway			1
and despite @entity7 ’s rapidly deteriorating condition , there were repeated delays in alerting an on - call consultant			1
doctor @entity115 , @entity11 's director of patient safety , carried out an internal investigation into the incident			2
he told the inquest questions were raised about the decision of the on - call consultant dr @entity121 to stay at home			1
he said : ' the consultant should have probed further about the deterioration			0
it is difficult for me to comment on his decision to stay at home			0
' dr @entity129 no longer works for the trust and is now based in @entity132 so was not called to give evidence			0
the coroner , @entity85 , also heard that doctors at @entity11 were unable to give @entity7 the drugs she needed because they were past their use by date a post-mortem concluded the schoolgirl died from multiple organ failure caused by epilepsy , an associated brain problem and obesity			1
following @entity7 ’s death there have been two independent reviews and a plan put in place to prevent a repeat of the tragedy			0
improvements include regular drug date checks , consultants remaining on site until 9pm and ‘ tailor - made ’ care plans for patients with complex medical conditions			0
mrs @entity85 said : ‘ i am pleased to see there have been some improvements in places but they must be on - going and must be implemented			0
‘ there is no point having an action plan unless it is implemented fully so little girls like this much - loved little girl are not at risk			0
’ the hospital claims that since @entity7 ’s death , there have been major changes			2
mrs @entity76 said : ‘ we have worked tirelessly to learn lessons from @entity7 ’s death and , as a result , the care we provide for children has been transformed			0
‘ a review of the way we manage medicines had also been undertaken to ensure they are available and in stock at all times			0
’ after @entity7 ’s death , the @entity183 branded children ’s services at the hospital ‘ completely unacceptable ’			2
