i spoke to @entity1 for an hour this week and we have talked long and hard about what he is going to do next			1
needless to say , we were disappointed to see @entity5 lose at the weekend against @entity6			1
it was n’t a result we were expecting and it also blows away the chance of @entity1 and @entity10 fighting in @entity11 – a fight @entity13 wanted			1
now we turn to three big fights in the next two months to see what @entity13 does next			2
i have held talks with @entity18 ’s manager and there is also the possibility of @entity21 , but there are three fights coming up where the winner could work for @entity13			0
@entity1 ( left ) has not fought since beating @entity26 at @entity27 last may @entity1 has kept in shape and weighs 12st 7lbs - despite being away from the ring for nearly a year now @entity1 had hoped to meet @entity30 , but he lost to @entity6 last week there is the possibility of @entity34 - @entity33 in the pipeline , @entity36 versus @entity37 for the @entity39 world title and @entity42 ’s @entity41 world title fight against @entity43 , which is the biggest bout of this trio			1
@entity36 ’s people have already been in touch with me about a @entity1 fight in the event that he wins , but i wonder if it is big enough			1
a fight against @entity43 still feels to me like the most probable , if he comes through against @entity42 on may 23			1
that is a huge fight , a proper 50 - 50 , but i fully believe he can do it			1
for me , from talking to @entity13 , i think he needs to fight again in 2015 if he is to ever return			2
if does n’t come back this year , i do n’t think he will			2
he has been a year out of the ring so let ’s see			0
i know he is going to have an eagle eye on all these fights			0
the possibility of him retiring is very high but he is still training hard			0
he is walking around at 12st 7lbs and in the gym four to five days a week			0
the guy has the hunger but it has to be for the right fight and the right money			2
my belief is still that it might be @entity43			2
@entity43 has looked sensational in camp and is improving at a brilliant rate – if he wins the title over in the @entity73 he will be in a great position			2
when i was on the phone to @entity13 he spent 20 minutes talking about the guy			0
he is a fighter that absolutely fascinates him ; it ’s a fight that would get everyone talking			2
i am looking at it			0
it would have to be at 168lbs and it would be special			0
i would n’t want to be the one to find out how @entity18 punches at the weight but @entity13 has a sick mind like that			0
i ’m not going to rule that one out			0
@entity43 ( right ) has now emerged as the most likely next opponent for @entity1 on his return another option for @entity1 could be a rematch with @entity33 , should the @entity90 beat @entity34 after a disappointing couple of weeks it seems that my hopes to stage @entity97 - @entity96 this summer are dead in the water			1
we received no offers from their side and made three of our own – we offered a 50 - 50 split , a 60 - 40 in favour of the winner and also a £ 1.5m guarantee to @entity97			1
i sent that last offer in writing to them and had no response			0
you ask yourself who is making these decisions ? it is life - changing money for @entity97 that has been offered			1
let ’s hope they do n’t spend the rest of their lives kicking themselves			0
@entity96 will move on and fight on july 18			1
i can guarantee that in his next fight he will fight a tougher opponent than @entity97 will			1
@entity96 ( right , in action against @entity125 ) will fight on july 18 against an unnamed opponent @entity97 's team failed to make an offer to fight @entity96 , according to his promoter @entity129 @entity129 went live on @entity130 to offer @entity97 and his team £ 1.5m to fight @entity96 @entity132 has been added to my may 9 show in @entity134 , where he will fight @entity135 , the @entity90 champion			1
he is 6ft 4ins and this will be a good test for @entity36 against a big man before he then has his 02 fight against @entity141 on may 30			1
we are keeping him busy , which is what he wants			0
i saw him in the gym this week and he is looking awesome			0
after the @entity141 fight he will be out again on july 18 in @entity147 and then in september in a big fight			2
@entity132 ( left ) beat @entity150 ( right ) last time out and will now face @entity135			0

if @entity1 does *n't* fight in 2015 i *'m* not sure he *'ll* be back at all
a *blockbuster* with @entity43 is most likely after @entity5 *defeat* - but @entity36 has made contact
@entity96 - @entity97 summer fight is dead in the water
