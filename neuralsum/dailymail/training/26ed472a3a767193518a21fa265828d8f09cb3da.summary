by @entity0 for @entity1 passion killer : mr @entity3 , a @entity4 's family division judge , advised divorcing women not to begin new romances until proceedings are over women fighting their ex-husbands for divorce settlements should shy away from new romances , says a high court judge			1
mr @entity3 said the start of a new relationship can be a ' significant fly in the ointment ' to judges in the family court deciding how much money ex-wives should be awarded			1
women risk losing their share of their ex-husbands assets because judges might assume their financial future was assured through setting up home with their new partners , he said			0
mr @entity3 made his comments in a written ruling on a family court case in @entity29 , the @entity25 reported			1
the couple , both in their 40s , had lived together with an adopted child			0
the mother worked hard as a journalist , while the father had no income , but had inherited millions from his family			0
their marriage turned sour in september 2012 , and the couple began lengthy legal wrangles over how to share their assets			0
as these disputes continued , the wife started a relationship with a former army officer			2
she did n't come clean about her romance , but investigations by her husband 's legal team revealed it to the court			0
it seriously hurt her case , with mr @entity3 reasoning : ' she says she is not going to live with him , although it is perfectly clear that the relationship is strong			1
' relationships like this always are a significant fly in the ointment in the assessment of need			0
' one can not make assumptions , if it is not full - blown cohabitation akin to marriage , that it will grow into that , because if it does not , the wife may be left stranded between @entity72 if the assumption is wrongly made			2
' on the other hand , if one makes a needs assessment on the basis that she is a single woman and she soon cohabits , then the paying party ... can rightfully feel significantly aggrieved			0
' divorce : mr @entity3 made his comments in a written ruling on a family court case in @entity29 taking into account the relationship , mr @entity3 decided that around £ 250,000 would be enough to meet her needs - less than if she had remained single			1
' if the wife were assuredly single and i could foresee that continuing , i would have my doubts as to whether a net capital position ... of just over £ 250,000 would be enough , ' he said			0
' on the other hand , i can not ignore the existence of the relationship ... and so i reach the conclusion that the net figure that i leave the wife with of just over £ 250,000 is sufficient to meet her needs			1
' family lawyer @entity96 , of @entity97 , told the @entity25 she thought the judge 's conclusion was ' a bit of a reach '			1
' i ’m not quite sure how this judge is so sure that their relationship is n’t some sort of flash in the pan ' , she said .			2
