by @entity0 @entity2 's ipad mini launched last week , and before iteven went on sale , enterprising fans has acquired one and ripped it apart			1
however , today another site , @entity8 , has gone one step further and worked out exactly how much the gadget costs @entity2 to make			1
the firm says that the @entity14 @entity13 base model costs roughly £ 117 ( $ 188 ) for @entity2 to build - and it sells them for £ 269 ( $ 329 ) each			1
during its @entity36 earnings call last week , @entity2 's cfo @entity34 said that the ipad mini gross margin is ' significantly below ' the rest of the products @entity2 is cranking out			1
' we ’re unwilling to cut corners in delivering the best experiences in the world , ' @entity40 added			0
@entity2 also said it will be working to make ipad mini production more cost - effective in the future			1
in its report , @entity18 further looked at the components that are being used to build the ipad mini			2
it was found that @entity51 and @entity52 are supplying roughly $ 80 in display components for the 7.9 - inch tablet			2
@entity56 ’s teardown released on friday found that @entity57 is also making display components , too			0
@entity57 was also found to be supplying the @entity60 chip in the ipad mini in @entity18 ’ report			2
however , @entity18 was n't the first site to rip apart @entity2 's new mini			1
@entity56 got there before the gadget even went on sale the £ 269 ipad mini goes on sale tomorrow , but the site has already posted a look inside the gadget set to become the must - have this @entity74			2
@entity2 's ipad mini uses a display from @entity77 's @entity57 , one of @entity2 's major suppliers and also its fiercest rival in the global mobile - device market that the two companies dominate			1
analysts say the @entity86 - based @entity85 maker is trying to wean itself off its reliance on @entity57 , as both giants are embroiled in a bitter international legal battle over mobile patents , for everything from microchips to displays			0
in the first dismantling of the ipad mini , which will be sold in 34 countries beginning tomorrow , teardown and gadget - repair specialist company , @entity56 , discovered a @entity57 display driver chip , which indicated that @entity2 had picked the @entity77 firm 's screen technology			1
like most producers of mobile hardware , the @entity20 company typically employs several suppliers for the same components in its gadgets			0
@entity2 has been known to use screens made by @entity51 , for instance			0
the chips ( coloured ) which reveal @entity57 as the screen supplier for @entity2 's ipad mini the ifixit site details the entire process of dismantling the @entity114 the @entity56 site is well known for taking apart gadgets as soon as they are released			1
it aims to help third parties find out how easy their new gadget are to repair , and each new gadget is given a ' repairability index '			0
in the ipad mini 's case , the index was low - meaning few parts can be repaired			0
however , the firm did find that the @entity57 manufactured screen can be easily repaired			0
' though the markings on the back of the @entity134 ( display ) do n't turn up much information , the @entity57 display driver @entity128 ( chip ) reveals that @entity2 , once again , went with @entity57 in its display manufacturing , ' @entity56 said , detailing the teardown on its website			2
however , @entity2 does sometimes uses more than one supplier			0
supplying parts for @entity2 's iphones and @entity142 - some of the industry 's most popular and advanced gadgets - is considered a coup for chipmakers and other manufacturers			1
the ipad mini also employs @entity150 flash memory , a @entity152 touch controller , and a number of microchips from @entity155 , according to @entity56 , which acquired one early			0
the 7.9 - inch ipad mini marks the @entity2 's first foray into the smaller - tablet segment			1
the company hopes to beat back incursions into its home territory - carved out with the original @entity114 's launch in 2010 - with 7 - inch slates that are popular with consumers , even as it safeguards its lead in a larger tablet space that even deep - pocketed rivals like @entity57 have found tough to penetrate			1
it has won mostly positive reviews focused on its ability to wrap most of the functions of its full - sized @entity114 sibling into a smaller package , but critics pointed out the higher price tag of the ipad mini and an inferior display relative to those of rival products like @entity181 's @entity180 and @entity183 's @entity182			1
the main motherboard of the @entity114 , with @entity2 's a % processor visible in the centre			1
however , the site has so far failed to identify many of the other components in the gadget			0
online sales have run for a week , but @entity2 has not disclosed sales numbers so far			0
friday 's global sales rollout may offer a hint of demand for the gadget , which analysts expect to be strong			0
@entity2 and @entity57 are engaged in patent disputes across several countries , and @entity2 is believed to be seeking ways to rely less on @entity57			2
but the @entity201 tech powerhouse remains a key supplier for @entity2 , manufacturing its application processors and providing other components			2
@entity57 has stopped supplying displays for @entity2 's @entity85 , and plays a reduced role in the full - sized @entity114 , according to @entity207			1
@entity2 is also buying fewer memory chips from @entity57 for the @entity85 , relying more on @entity150 and @entity30			0
many analysts believe @entity2 will also gradually phase out @entity57 as the main producer of the mobile micro-processor and shift business to rival supplier @entity213			0

the team have so far identified the marked chips , but are yet to confirm what their function is			0
do not try this at home : the team used a heat torch to melt the glue in the rear of the @entity114 mini holding the internal components together the @entity60 processor @entity56 found at the heart of the ipad mini the ipad mini 's touchscreen controller chips the ipad mini 's stereo speakers the camera sensor being removed from the casing @entity56 has previously taken apart the @entity85 5 , seen here the @entity85 's arch rival , the @entity254 , in pieces the @entity85 laid bare by ifixit			2
