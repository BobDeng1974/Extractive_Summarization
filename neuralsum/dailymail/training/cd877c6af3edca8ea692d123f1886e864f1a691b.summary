hero firefighter @entity0 was off duty when he saw the first aircraft crash into the @entity3 13 years ago before racing to his assigned station house in @entity5			1
now the 24 - year veteran is facing a life - or - death battle with a rare form of blood cancer , which he believed was caused by breathing toxic dust from the scene of the disaster			1
such was the rush to get to @entity14 , many of @entity0 's colleagues did n't even have basic safety equipment such as masks or respirators			1
the 54 - year - old firefighter was diagnosed last year with multiple myeloma in june 2013 and now needs a lifesaving bone marrow transplant			1
firefighter @entity0 believes his cancer was caused by breathing in toxic dust from 9/11 as soon as @entity0 saw the second aircraft crash he raced to @entity14 to help with the rescue @entity0 said the area was covered by toxic dust but his main thoughts were about rescuing other people since his diagnosis , the father of three has undergone five intensive rounds of chemotherapy , but requires stem cell treatment to control the incurable disease			1
six members of his firehouse died on 9/11 while four others have gone on to develop cancer			2
new research has shown that emergency service personnel who spent long periods of time at @entity14 following the disaster have a 20 per cent higher change of developing cancer compared with the general population			2
a study published in @entity49 in 2011 proved the link between working at @entity14 and an elevated cancer risk			2
the @entity52 of @entity53 even lists the names of men who have died from cancer linked to 9/11 on a memorial to their fallen colleagues			2
now the firefighter is trying to encourage people to sign up to a national bone marrow register in order to help sufferers like himself			1
speaking to @entity66 , @entity0 said : ' i knew that there was potential for great harm , but i just did n’t think it would come in the form of cancer as multiple myeloma years later			1
so now i ’m no longer fighting fires , i ’m basically fighting for my life , hoping for a donor			0
' he added : ' in my firehouse alone , over the last few years , including myself , there have been five men diagnosed with cancer ; two with multiple myeloma , one with leukemia , one lymphoma and one with lung cancer ' so if you multiply that by all the firehouses throughout @entity53 , i think you start to get a picture of what we ’re dealing with here			1
' six members of his old firehouse in @entity95 died on 9/11 while four others have developed cancer he told the @entity99 that he has no regrets about his actions on 9/11 even though it is responsible for his cancer			2
he said : ' every firefighter on the job would say if they had to do it all over again , they would			0
that ’s the way it goes			0
there ’s nothing like having a job where you help people for a living			0
any time you go out and come across someone in need , you think about your own family			0
' and then there 's the brotherhood			0
we work together through thick and thin			0
i do n’t know too many other jobs out there that offer that			0
it ’s rewarding on so many levels			0
' medics treating @entity0 were able to harvest some of his own stem cells and give him a transfusion that has sent the cancer into partial remission			1
but in the longer term he will require a donor			0
as a result he is involved in a massive awareness raising campaign to get people to join the national bone marrow register			1
potential donors only need to supply a simple cheek swab which takes only three to five minutes .			0
