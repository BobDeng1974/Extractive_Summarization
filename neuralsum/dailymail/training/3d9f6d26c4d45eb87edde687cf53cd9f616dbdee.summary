@entity0 eased into the @entity2 third round at @entity4 ’s expense in a tale of three penalties			1
@entity7 @entity4 were left to wonder what might have been had @entity9 not skewed a spot - kick into the stand early in the second half			1
they were punished in ruthless fashion by @entity14 , who sent the @entity16 promotion contenders through with two textbook penalties			1

the @entity22 battled their way to the semi-finals in this competition last season - losing in an eight - goal thriller to @entity70 - but @entity72 in the springtime was a world removed from this			0
on a chilly afternoon , @entity74 was barely a third full and those that did turn up had to endure a pretty soporific first - half			0
the hosts , who needed a replay to beat @entity81 in round one , started the brighter and skipper @entity31 was n’t too far wide with a 25 - yard sighter after @entity36 had teed him up			0
a couple of minutes later , @entity25 roared forward from right - back and his firmly - struck shot was pushed clear by @entity87			0

he swapped passes with @entity54 as @entity4 sprung forward but the latter was pulled up by referee @entity61 for diving in the box			2
@entity92 also dragged an effort wide after @entity100 intercepted a loose @entity32 pass and raced down the right flank			0

@entity0 , who have a @entity133 quarter - final with @entity134 coming up on tuesday week , roused themselves and @entity25 was able to cut inside and roll the ball just wide of the post			2
the second half could only be an improvement and @entity4 immediately had a chance to steal the lead			2
@entity50 got goal side of @entity27 and was dragged to the turf for a clear penalty			0
but , in front of the end where the 638 travelling fans were gathered , @entity9 sliced his spot - kick into the stand			2
it was a massive let - off for the @entity22 and they went straight on the offensive , with half - time substitute @entity30 firing a fraction wide			0
@entity30 was making quite an impact and when @entity156 grappled with him as he tried to break into the @entity4 area , the referee had no hesitation in awarding another spot - kick			1
@entity14 ( right ) opens the scoring from the penalty in the second half at @entity74 @entity4 keeper @entity87 shouts instructions from his goalline @entity25 ( left ) of @entity0 is chased down by @entity4 's @entity54 team - mates rush to congratulate @entity14 after he doubles the @entity22 ' lead with his second penalty @entity30 ( right ) completed the comprehensive victory with a goal in the dying minutes @entity14 showed @entity9 how to dispatch from 12 yards , leaving @entity44 no chance with a drilled penalty into the bottom left corner			1
and just after the hour , @entity0 were awarded another penalty when @entity47 brought down @entity34 in the area			0
again , @entity14 made no mistake			0
@entity14 had an excellent chance to complete his hat - trick with 12 minutes left but missed the target when well placed			1
his job was done , however , and he received a standing ovation when replaced in the final five minutes as the @entity22 made further @entity2 gains .			2
