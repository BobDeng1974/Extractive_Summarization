by @entity1 reporter published : 09:30 est , 11 december 2013 updated : 09:36 est , 11 december 2013 millennial women in @entity3 are more likely to receive pay nearly equal to their male counterparts than any previous generation			1
a @entity8 study out wednesday shows that the working women of @entity10 bring home around 93 percent of the earnings of men			1
but even as the wage gap closes , women aged 18 to 32 remain as pessimistic as their mothers and grandmothers regarding gender equality			1
closing the gap ? a new @entity8 study out wednesday found that millennial women are more likely to receive pay nearly equal to their male counterparts than any generation before overall , women earned just 84 percent of what men were paid in 2012 according to the @entity8 study			1
though the younger generation is more fortunate after decades of women ’s demands for equal pay , 75 percent of women 18 - 32 still say the @entity3 needs to do more to bring about equality in the workplace			1
some 57 percent of young men answered the same way			2
while women under 32 now have higher rates of college completion than men that age , the analysis of census and labor data shows their hourly earnings will slip further behind by the women 's mid- 30s , if the experience of the past three decades is a guide			0
narrower , but still there : @entity8 's research shows that women 25 to 34 make 93 percent of what their male counterparts take home			1
compare that to the 84 percent that woman make versus men overall that widening gap is due in part to the many women who take time off or reduce their hours to start families			1
other factors cited in the report are gender stereotyping , discrimination , weaker professional networks and women 's hesitancy to aggressively push for raises and promotions , which together may account for 20 to 40 percent of the pay gap			2
even so , just 15 percent of young women say they have been discriminated against because of their gender			1
‘ today 's generation of young women is entering the labor force near parity with men in terms of earnings and extremely well prepared in terms of their educational attainment , ’ said @entity74 , associate director with the @entity75			2
‘ they feel empowered in many ways , yet when they look at the workplace , they see it as a ' man 's world ' with the deck stacked against them			0
’ ‘ they think that men earn more than women for doing the same job and that it 's easier for men to get top executive jobs than it is for women , ’ she said			0
women are increasingly moving into higher career positions both in government and business			0
they make up nearly half the workforce , and the share of women in managerial and administrative occupations is nearly equal to that of men — 15 percent compared to 17 percent			2
not out of the woods : despite the great strides made in closing the pay gap , even millennial women continue to be skeptical about gender equality in @entity3 -- nearly as skeptical as their mothers and grandmothers @entity118 , a sociology professor at @entity119 , attributed young women 's negative assessments about gender equality to their rising career expectations			1
‘ more doors are now open to women , but they can now see how far they are from equality in high - level jobs , ’ he said			0
the near - equal pay for young women is being driven in large part by their educational gains			2
some 38 percent of women ages 25 - 32 now hold bachelor 's degrees , compared to 31 percent of young men			2
as a result , 49 percent of employed workers with at least a bachelor 's degree last year were women , up from 36 percent in 1980			0
that means more women in higher - skilled , higher - paying positions			0
the current ratio of hourly earnings for young women to young men , now at 93 percent , is up from 67 percent in 1980 and is the highest in government records dating back to at least 1979			1
across all age groups , the median hourly wage for women last year was 84 percent as much as men — $ 14.90 vs. $ 17.79 , up from 64 percent in 1980			1
at the same time , the @entity8 study indicates that a woman 's job advancement often will hit a ceiling , due in part to competing demands of work and family			0
women remain twice as likely as men to work part - time and are more likely to take significant time off from employment during their lives to care for children or other family members			0
still skeptical : while the wages are going up for millennial women , the @entity8 study shows that 75 percent of women aged 18 - 32 think more should be done to bring about gender equality			1
in boomer generation women , the number was only slightly higher among young women , 59 percent say that being a working parent makes it harder to advance in a job or career , compared to just 19 percent of young men			1
across all age groups , 22 percent of women and 9 percent of men report having quit jobs for family reasons at some point during their working lives			0
fewer young women than young men aspire to become a boss or top manager			2
some 34 percent say they 're not interested , compared to 24 percent of young men			0
and the vast majority of adults of all ages who reduced their work hours to care for family members — 94 percent — say they are glad they did it			0
‘ this report shows that we are still very much in a ' stalled revolution ' when it comes to gender equality in the workplace — and young women see it , ’ said @entity196 , a sociology professor at the @entity197			1
‘ when we see our male @entity205 taking off a day to care for a sick child , then we will be working in a more gender - equal workplace — and a more gender - equal world			0
’ the @entity8 study was based on interviews with 2,002 adults by cellphone or landline from october 7 to october 27			0
the @entity8 poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.7 percentage points .			0
