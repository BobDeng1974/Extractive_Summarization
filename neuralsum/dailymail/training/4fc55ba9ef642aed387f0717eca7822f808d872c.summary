@entity0 has hit the ground running and is proving to be worth every penny of the £ 32million spent by @entity4 manager @entity3			1
but can he really be as good as @entity5 ? with that in mind , @entity6 asked @entity4 fan @entity9 of @entity4 to tell us what he makes of the idea			1
can @entity0 become as big a legend as @entity5 ? let 's see what @entity9 thinks			1
as the @entity4 and @entity17 international star @entity0 grabbed yet another game by the scruff of the neck and shook it mercilessly at the @entity21 against @entity22 , he was watched by the last player able to thrill the @entity4 fans in a similar way : @entity5			1
the former @entity26 international was there with another @entity29 legend , @entity28 , as a guest of the club and i wonder what they made of the latest incredible display by @entity4 ’s new strike star			0
they can not fail to have been impressed with @entity0 putting in his usual workload , which any combative central midfield general would be proud of			0
and that is what really makes him different and suggests to the @entity4 fans that we have finally found a player that can have the same influence as the great man who recently hung up his boots			0
@entity0 celebrates scoring for @entity4 against @entity22 at the @entity21 on sunday @entity0 , who cost £ 30m , has hit the ground running since joining @entity4 from @entity49 @entity5 used to light up a pitch in the way that very few players can but @entity0 has that too , like the incredible run and finish for his second goal against @entity22			1
football fans always love a player who gives their all , but when that player can also do things that nobody else can , he truly becomes something special and we take him to our heart			0
as i remember , it took a lot longer for the @entity4 fans to really warm to @entity5 , although he was younger and was more of a winger or wide forward when @entity3 brought him to the @entity69			2
with @entity0 , though , it was almost instant because of the effort and dynamism he showed from the very start			0
@entity5 celebrates scoring in 2012 for @entity4 during his second stint with the north @entity76 club a cutting edge helps , of course , so when he scored the only goal of the two - legged play - off against @entity82 to book @entity4 another place in the @entity85 group stage , another box was ticked off			2
someone suggested on our website a few days ago that @entity0 had yet to prove himself for @entity4 against the big teams to really start to be compared with @entity5			1
but they seem to have forgotten his stunning volley that gave us the lead against @entity93 in september			0
how about the second goal against @entity96 in a massive game that kept @entity4 hopes of progressing to the knockout stage alive ? to suggest that @entity0 does not have a big - game mentality is just wrong			2
@entity5 was spotted at the @entity21 this week to watch @entity4 face @entity22 in the @entity69 @entity5 and @entity28 ( right ) watch @entity4 from the stands as the former @entity29 visited the @entity21 i can not think of a player with a better or more consistent attitude and i believe that he would give his all against @entity105 in a final in the same way he would on an away trip to @entity109 in a rainy @entity111 replay , because he loves the game			1
and he seems to have found his perfect home with @entity4 , where he does not have to play second fiddle to @entity115 and is fully appreciated by his adoring fans			0
you can only wonder what the @entity49 fans now think after seeing him explode on to the @entity69 stage , when they used to greet him with lukewarm applause at best			0
i firmly believe that @entity0 can have the same sort of impact for @entity4 as @entity5 had			1
he may not have enough time to break the @entity26 ’s scoring record and he needs to keep producing every season , but without injury problems to stop him and as long as he has the team - mates around to back him up , @entity0 will be an @entity4 great and will surely lead the @entity29 back to glory … @entity0 has been a huge hit and blogger @entity9 is backing him to get even bigger visit just @entity4 or follow them on @entity132 by clicking here			2
