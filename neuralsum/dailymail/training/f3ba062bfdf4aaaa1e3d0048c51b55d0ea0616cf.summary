but the @entity15 electrical engineer was a complex man who led an extraordinary life during @entity17 becoming @entity19 's first double agent and helping to crack @entity7 's @entity21 military codes , a new book reveals			1
given the codename @entity23 by his paymasters in @entity25 , he helped @entity9 capture numerous @entity27 spies , including all those dropped by parachute or boat in @entity32 in 1940			1
@entity2 - the @entity1 by @entity33 and @entity34 - tells how his journey into the world of spying began when he walked into the @entity7 embassy in @entity8 in 1935			1
mired in debt after failing to sell a method for improving batteries he went there in the hope they would be interested in his invention			0
' he walked into the @entity7 embassy as an inventor but he came out as the @entity7 spy " @entity23 " , ' co-author @entity34 told thisissouthwales			1
' as they secretly rearmed themselves in preparation for war , the @entity7 were keen to know how prepared @entity19 was against attack			1
with his contacts in the military in @entity19 and his cover as a battery inventor , @entity2 was exactly what the @entity7 were looking for			1
' but his activities eventually became known to @entity9 and it was then that he agreed to work for them thereby becoming their first double agent			2
his codename became @entity2 , a partial anagram of his surname @entity65			1
she also appeared in films alongside @entity73 and @entity74 interviewed about his father , @entity75 said : ' i would say the only side he was on was his own side			0
he was very much for himself			0
' the @entity15 nationalist was seen by @entity25 as being a key part of building up their spy network in @entity19 and furthermore the @entity7 saw nationalists as useful in organising a future invasion			1
as a result , all agents sent to the @entity19 were ordered to get in touch with ' @entity23 '			1
this then gave @entity9 the edge in the espionage war and enabled them to give those they captured a stark choice of either working as double agents or facing the firing squad			1
these agents were then used to feed false information back to @entity25			1
owens became wealthy with his activities but @entity9 were never wholly convinced by his loyalty			2
the book reveals how they also knew that after drinking he would say he loathed the @entity32 establishment because his father had been cheated out of money for ordnance he invented in the @entity109			0
to this end they sent a minder - a @entity113 policeman - with him when he went on a daring mission to @entity115 to meet the city 's head of the secret service known as dr @entity119			2
the @entity7 were keen to find a drop - off point for weapons along the @entity123 coast and @entity9 , keen to keep their cover as real as possible , sent the men to the @entity126 where they found a beach for @entity128 to deliver arms			1
the book also reveals the men were told by their @entity7 handlers that anyone prepared to fly a @entity134 back to @entity135 would be richly rewarded			2
the end to his spying activities came in 1941 when @entity65 was ordered to go to @entity139 , in @entity140 , by @entity141 where he was immediately accused of being a double agent			2
the book says he admitted it but then , mysteriously , was allowed to return to @entity32 where he told @entity9 what had happened			2
the book reveals how @entity9 knew that @entity65 loathed the @entity32 establishment because he claimed his father had been cheated out of money for ordnance he invented in @entity109 already suspicious of him , they became wary of whose side he was really on and interned him for the rest of the war			1
interviewed about his father , @entity75 said : ' i would say the only side he was on was his own side			0
it looked like he just changed sides with the prevailing wind			0
he was very much for himself			0
' he said he had no idea about his father 's extraordinary past until after he died and his mother told him			2
furthermore , he found out that his step - sister @entity65 was the @entity69 actress who starred in the 1958 sci - fi classic @entity71			1
she would also go on to star alongside @entity73 and @entity74			0
fearful that her father would still be seen as a traitor she kept their relationship quiet			0
mr @entity75 said he should have realised there was something odd about his father when as a youngster he walked through his father 's shop with a friend carrying a flag which had a swastika on it			0
' he went ballistic when he saw this			0
he said " are you trying to get me locked up ? ! "			0
we did not understand what he meant at the time but looking back on it now i see the significance			0
' his father died in 1957 and is buried in an unmarked grave outside @entity190 in southern @entity191			0
when asked what kind of a man his father was , he replied : ' a very interesting person , whatever your loyalties or politics are			0
he was n't your average @entity198			0
