many popular @entity6 eggs contain more sugar than is recommended in a day by the @entity14 there is nothing as synonymous with @entity6 as chocolate eggs			1
a survey released this week found the average child will eat eight of the chocolate treats , totalling a massive 8,000 calories over the long weekend			0
but while the holiday might be a child 's favourite , a nutritionist has warned too much sugar can lead to obesity , type 2 diabetes and tooth decay			1
dr @entity132 , a nutrition scientist , also warned too much of the sweet stuff can exacerbate polycystic ovarian syndrome and behavioural problems like @entity136			1
the @entity14 recommends 50g of added sugar a day ( roughly 12 and a half teaspoons ) , on top of natural sugars that occur in fruit and milk			1
dr @entity143 has calculated that many popular eggs contain more than the recommended daily amount of sugar			1
@entity147 contains 182 per cent of the recommended daily amount , while a @entity149 has 161 per cent			0
depending on how physically active the children are , eating too much sugar could trigger insulin resistance , dr @entity143 said			1
this is where the body becomes de-sensitised to insulin , the hormone that controls how much sugar is in the bloodstream			1
over time this slowly damages cells and organs in the body , and leads to type 2 diabetes			0
she said : ' @entity166 causes pathological changes , their bodies become resistant to insulin and have cellular damage to all parts of the body			0
' it also leads to weight gain			0
‘ insulin resistance puts you at a metabolic disadvantage to lose weight			0
it actually becomes very hard to lose weight once the body ca n’t break down sugar , ’ she explained			1
‘ dermatologists used to say “ chocolate and sugar does n’t harm skin ”			2
now they are saying ‘ yes they do ’			0
she added children could also become deficient in other nutrients too			0
she said : ' if someone 's overstraining their insulin system they lose more nutrients in urine , as do trace elements like zinc			0
' you can upset metabolism by having too much sugar			2
' eating too much sugar can lead to obesity , type 2 diabetes , tooth decay , nutrient deficiencies , acne and behavioural problems , a nutritionist warns this can also lead to other deficiencies as children may fill up on sugar but not eat other , more nutritious food , so they miss out on vitamins and minerals , she added			1
having a healthy diet the rest of the year can actually protect against the damaging effects of insulin resistance , which sugar might trigger			2
‘ eat wholegrains , fruit and veg , portions of oil rich fish - the nutrients in foods will help make the body more sensitive to insulin			0
‘ if someone takes multi-vitamins , it helps sensitise the body to insulin , so you ’re more likely to burn off sugar			1
‘ we fail to eat our micronutrients every day and it can actually help the nation become less obese			0
’ she added that if a person is going to overindulge , solid chocolate eggs are better for health than ones with sugary fillings			2
she said : ' any of the ones with pure chocolate rather than squidgy fillings are better			0
' i 'd avoid fondant or caramel , and go for solid chocolate			0
' then you 'll be eating more polyphenols and less added sugar			2
' the squidgy ones have added sugar on top of the sugar in cocoa			2
' eating a small treat , rather than gorging on multiple eggs , allows children to enjoy easter without risking their health , she continued			2
she said : ' eat a crème egg or a solid egg ’s worth , something that can sit on your child 's hand instead of covering their entire dinner plate			0
' dr @entity143 recommends @entity278 vitamin supplement , which has added chromium , cinnamon bark and magnesium and claims to stave off sugar cravings and boost energy levels .			1
