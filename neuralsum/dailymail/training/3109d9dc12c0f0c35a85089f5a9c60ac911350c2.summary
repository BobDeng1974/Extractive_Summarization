by @entity0 published : 10:21 est , 4 december 2013 updated : 11:17 est , 4 december 2013 the @entity1 has spent more than £ 1.3m on return flights for workers going between @entity4 and @entity5 since many of its programmes were moved north			1

around 2,300 staff work at the @entity20 site , where @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 are produced			1
home from home : the @entity1 has spent £ 1.3million on flights between @entity4 and @entity5 since the corporation moved to the @entity13 site in @entity20 in may 2011 the programmes , and many others , had previously been made at the @entity1 's iconic @entity33 in @entity34 , west @entity4 , which closed in march this year			1
it was sold in july 2012 for £ 200 million and developer @entity36 plans to turn the building into a modern studio centre , hotel , apartments , as well as a home for the commercial headquarters of the @entity1			2
a freedom of information request revealed today shows that the @entity1 spent £ 377,000 on flights between may 2011 and march 2012			1
between april 2012 and march of this year , that figure rose to a staggering £ 605,000 , and from april to september this year the corporation has spent a total of £ 312,000 - making a grand total of £ 1,294,000 in just 29 months			0
the works out as an average of £ 44,620 spent every month on flights to and from the capital and @entity13 @entity53			2
the total figure spent could even be hundreds of thousands of pounds more as the data only includes flights booked through the @entity1 's central booking system			1
many staff book flights to and from the two bases themselves - meaning their reservations do not go through the central booking system - and then claim the cash back on expenses			0
a @entity1 source , who asked not to be named , said : ' we all knew the travel costs would sky - rocket when @entity14 opened			1
' iconic : the @entity1 's former @entity4 headquarters at @entity33 closed in march this year a spokesman for @entity71 said : ' spend on flights is subject to rigorous scrutiny and staff are encouraged to use alternatives to travel such as video conferencing wherever possible , but when travel is necessary staff should use the lowest cost of travel and fare			1
' ' the @entity1 is a national broadcaster and travel is an integral part of our core spend in bringing high quality programmes to our viewers ( and ) much of these costs will have been programme related			1
' @entity91 at @entity13 is the @entity1 's largest creative hub outside of @entity4 , and is home to 24 @entity1 departments , including @entity95 , @entity96 , radio 5 live and @entity22			0
' @entity98 , chief executive of the campaign group @entity99 , said that the @entity1 should ensure that licence fee payers do not lose out because of the money spent on flights			2
he said : ' the move to @entity14 meant that it was inevitable that travel costs for @entity1 guests and staff would increase			2
' but bosses at the broadcaster must ensure that travel between the two cities represents value for the licence fee and that staff have a duty to book cheapest option			0
' flying between @entity5 and @entity4 should only be done in exceptional circumstances , and only when it represents the best deal for licence fee payers			0
' the @entity1 has previously been criticised for paying staff a total of £ 24million in allowances following the move to @entity14			2
on the ball : many @entity1 programmes , including @entity21 , are now made in @entity5 a report by the public accounts committee of mps , released in october , said many of the allowances were ‘ excessive ’ and ‘ difficult to justify ’ to licence fee payers			1
in total , the corporation spent £ 942million setting up a new northern base to help redress a perceived @entity4 - centric bias in its coverage , but has had to offer 900 staff an average of £ 28,000 each to persuade them to move			0
some staff were offered perks including a guaranteed minimum price on their old home if they sold it and moved north			0
they could also claim a two - year ‘ remote location allowance ’ worth £ 1,900 a month to cover the cost of travel and renting a property in @entity14 if they were unwilling to commit to move			0
other staff were offered a one off payment of £ 5,000 to help them move , while homeowners could claim £ 3,000 towards household goods			0
despite the huge expense of moving to @entity14 , the @entity1 does not own its new office space or studios			0
instead , it rents them from real estate giant the @entity157 also raised concerns about the 10 - year arrangement , saying the @entity1 could risk locking itself into making payments for buildings it may not use .			0
