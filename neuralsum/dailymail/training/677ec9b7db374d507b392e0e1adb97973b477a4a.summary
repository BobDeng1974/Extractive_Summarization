a woman has been put into isolation at @entity3 with a suspected case of @entity5 , it has emerged			1
the hospital released few details about the patient last night but it is believed she had recently travelled abroad			1
a spokesman for the hospital said : ' i can confirm that we have a suspected case of @entity5			1
it is a female adult			2
she will be in isolation if she is suspected of having the illness			1
it comes just two days after it was revealed the condition of @entity30 had improved - the 39 - year - old nurse was struck down by the virus after returning from @entity33 in west africa			1
in recent months @entity3 has attempted to reassure the public it has plans in place to manage cases of @entity5 in the event of an outbreak			1
a spokesman said : ' we have robust systems and processes which will ensure we are able to identify and isolate a patient who presents with symptoms of @entity5 or any other infectious disease			1
' we have sufficient supplies of personal protective equipment , and access to expert testing and advice			2
@entity30 ( pictured ) was a volunteer with @entity52 in @entity33 but only became ill with @entity5 after having returned to @entity53 ' we would like to reassure local people that the risk of infection in the @entity53 remains very low			1
' nevertheless we are being extremely vigilant and taking all appropriate measures to ensure we are fully prepared			0
our plans are being kept under continuous review and amended as the situation changes			0
' miss @entity30 had been a volunteer with @entity52 at the @entity61 in @entity62 but only became ill when she returned to @entity53 just after @entity63			1
after taking an experimental anti-viral drug and receiving blood plasma transfusions from a @entity67 @entity5 survivor at the @entity68 in north @entity69 , her condition improved			1
a hospital spokesman said monday : ' the @entity68 is pleased to announce that @entity30 is showing signs of improvement and is no longer critically ill. ' she remains in isolation as she receives specialist care for the ebola virus			1
' @entity77 welcomed the news during prime minister 's questions at the @entity81			0
he said he was sure everybody was thinking of her , adding : ' it is very good news that she is out of critical care , but there is still a long way to go			0
' he was responding to conservative @entity89 , who said : ' i 'm sure the whole @entity81 will want to honour the bravery of @entity5 volunteers and welcome the news that nurse @entity30 is off the critical list			1
' she also raised the work going on in @entity96 to develop a vaccine , which the @entity99 leader called ' vitally important '			0
he added : ' the minister for government policy is leading the work on this and making sure we do everything to try and cut through some of the bureaucracy that otherwise would be in place so that we can develop a vaccine fast			2
' there are currently no specific drugs to cure @entity5 , nor any approved vaccines to prevent the disease			1
two experimental vaccines are currently being trialled on human volunteers in the @entity53 , @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119			0
experts expect to see the first results of those trials early next year			0
the @entity68 is the only @entity123 in the @entity53 to house two high - security containment beds			0
they are located inside isolation ' bubbles ' - specially - designed tents with controlled ventilation allowing medics to provide clinical care while containing the infection			2
three other hospitals - the royal @entity131 and @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135 - are designated centres for escalation if more patients are diagnosed with @entity5			1
there are around 50 other designated @entity5 beds at these three centres			2
around 45 per cent of those infected in the current outbreak have survived without treatment			0
@entity145 , developed by @entity117 biotech company @entity146 , is manufactured in the leaves of genetically modified tobacco plants			0
the process could yield 20 to 40 doses a month			0
evidence suggests that effective treatment with @entity145 requires three doses of 15 milligrams per kilogram of body weight			0
it is thought the blood of those who have survived the disease may contain antibodies , which can prove effective in fighting the disease			0
the nurse , from @entity162 , @entity163 , had volunteered with @entity52 at the @entity61 in @entity62 , @entity33 , before returning to the @entity53			1
@entity52 has launched an investigation into how she was infected , but admits it may never establish the exact circumstances			0
she flew back to the @entity53 via @entity168 in @entity169			0
her temperature was tested seven times before she flew from @entity172 to @entity173 and she was cleared to travel			0
she later became feverish and followed advice given to her at @entity172 to contact local services and was admitted to an isolation facility at the @entity178 unit in @entity179 , @entity173 , at 8am on december 29			2
