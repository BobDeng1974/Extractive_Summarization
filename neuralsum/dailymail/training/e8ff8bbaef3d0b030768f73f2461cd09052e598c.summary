politicians ignore young people to chase the ' silver vote ' because older people are more likely to turn out on election day , a senior @entity1 frontbencher has admitted			1
@entity7 , the shadow justice secretary , said older voters were being targeted by the major political parties because they were more likely to vote than 18 to 24 year olds			1
he warned the problem meant more people in their twenties and thirties were becoming disengaged from the political process , believing parties will only govern in the interests of the elderly			2
turnout has fallen must steeply among 18 - 24 - year - olds , according to research of elections dating back to 1964 barely half of 18 - 24 - year - olds voted in the 2010 election , compared to almost three - quarters of the over- 65s			1
in the last 50 years total turnout has fallen from 77 per cent in 1964 to 65 per cent four years ago			0
in the sixties turnout was highest among 35 - 54 year olds , but social change and a sense of duty among the post-war generation means that 5 per cent more of of the over- 65s voted in 2010 than the next highest age group			1
mr @entity7 told the @entity34 : ' if you speak candidly to a campaign manager of any of the mainstream parties they will say that they concentrate their energies disproportionately on those they know are going to vote			2
' if you 've got a candidate with an hour spare and a choice to go to an old people 's home or a sixth - form college , 99 per cent of campaign managers will say you 've got to go to an old people 's home			1
that 's because 94 per cent of them are on the register and 77 per cent of them will vote			0
that 's not true of the younger generation			0
' you look at any empirical analysis of this government 's policies and you can see they are going for the silver vote			0
' @entity7 , the shadow justice secretary , said older voters were being targeted by the major political parties because they were more likely to vote than 18 to 24 year olds mr @entity7 , the mp for @entity64 , called for the voting age to be lowered to 16 , a longer polling period and online voting			1
' we as politicians have to understand the responsibility on us to engage young people in politics			2
if someone is not voting that is a problem , ' he added			0
today sees the first full day of general election campaigning , with all the main parties setting out their stall to voters			0
labour leader @entity80 will use a speech in @entity82 to warn the @entity83 is not safe in the @entity85 ' hands			0
five senior conservative cabinet ministers are expected to tell an event in @entity88 that @entity1 has committed to an extra £ 20billion in spending commitments for the first year of the next @entity90			0
and @entity92 leader @entity91 will use his monthly press conference to urge people who would prefer another hung parliament instead of single party rule to vote @entity92 a @entity98 research paper said : ' the decline in young people ’s engagement in politics has been a common theme of late			2
' voter turnout has been low among young people relative to older age groups , but in the context of falling overall turnout at @entity109 , the decline has been sharpest amongst voters aged 18 - 24			1

@entity7 says campaign managers focus on *wooing* older voters
