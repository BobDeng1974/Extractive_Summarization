@entity2 's shock 3 - 1 defeat by @entity3 may not have gone down well in @entity4 but in @entity5 – the blue half at least – it will have been a different story			1
@entity7 , whose side were outplayed in @entity9 on wednesday , remains @entity11 's first choice to replace under - fire @entity13			1
he has a year remaining on his contract in @entity15 but a quarter - final @entity17 exit , which now seems like a real possibility , could help persuade his employers let him go this summer			1
@entity7 saw his @entity2 side lose 3 - 1 against @entity3 on wednesday night in @entity9 @entity7 is seen as a natural fit given his close relationship with two of @entity11 's executives @entity7 , whose side were outplayed in @entity9 , remains @entity11 's first choice to become manager @entity13 has been under pressure lately as his side fell out of the race for the @entity30 title as a player ( defensive midfielder ) 1990 – 1992 : @entity33 ( 59 apps , 5 goals ) 1990 – 2001 : @entity33 ( 263 , 6 ) 2001 – 2002 : @entity36 ( 11 , 2 ) 2002 – 2003 : @entity37 ( 4 , 0 ) 2003 @entity36 ( 13 , 1 ) 2003 – 2005 : @entity38 ( 18 , 2 ) 2005 – 2006 : @entity39 ( 10 , 1 ) for the national team 1991 @entity42 @entity41 ( 2 caps , 0 goals ) 1991 – 1992 : @entity45 ( 12 , 2 ) 1992 – 2001 : @entity42 ( 47 , 5 ) 1995 – 2005 : @entity46 ( 7 , 0 ) teams managed 2007 – 2008 : @entity33 2008 – 2012 : @entity33 2013 – now : @entity2 that would work for @entity11			1
while current manager @entity13 has a year remaining on his own deal , he has come in for fierce criticism following the stunning collapse of @entity11 's @entity30 title defence and appears to be waiting for the knockout punch to land			2
but is @entity7 the right man for the job ? the boy from @entity33 is seen as a natural fit given his close relationship with @entity11 's executive pair @entity60 and @entity61 , with whom he worked during a glittering stint at the @entity64 , and his desire to play attractive , attacking football			2
however , @entity70 's @entity69 owners famously crave @entity17 progression and , based on recent evidence , there may be some doubt as to whether @entity7 can deliver that			1
the 44 - year - old 's early record in the competition is stunning , lifting the trophy two times in three years - although he will not inherit a team featuring the likes of @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 in @entity5			0
and a glimpse at his away record in the knockout stages of the competition might suggest all is not as it seems			0
in 17 matches on the road in @entity92 , @entity7 's teams have won just four times , drawing eight and losing five			1
he has never exited before the semi-final stage but has twice bowed out to teams deemed inferior			0
@entity98 's @entity97 in 2010 and @entity100 's @entity99 in 2012 would both go on to win the tournament but both were rightly seen as no match for the @entity104 before the ties kicked off			0
@entity7 has a year remaining on his contract but a quarter - final @entity17 exit could be a problem @entity13 looks set to lose out on the @entity30 title and is fighting to qualify for the @entity17 as a player @entity33 : @entity111 @entity33 : @entity114 ( 6 ) , @entity113 ( 2 ) , @entity112 ( 4 ) , @entity17 , @entity115 , @entity116 ( 2 ) @entity42 : @entity117 as a manager @entity33 : @entity119 @entity33 : @entity114 ( 3 ) , @entity113 ( 2 ) , @entity112 ( 3 ) , @entity17 ( 2 ) , @entity116 ( 2 ) , @entity120 ( 2 ) @entity2 : @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity116 , @entity120 at @entity2 , where he pitched up after a year 's sabbatical in 2013 , the @entity124 adventures have been no better			1
in his first season they saw off a sleepwalking @entity131 side and @entity133 's comatose @entity132 before @entity134 crushed them 5 - 0 on aggregate including that seismic 4 - 0 thumping at the @entity137			2
on wednesday , another away day defeat left @entity7 on the brink of his earliest exit yet			0
there may have been mitigation , with the likes of @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity146 missing but odds of 4 - 1 for a home win suggested the scale of the offence			2
@entity2 may well turn it around next week and many would hail it as the latest of @entity7 's achievements - and there are many			1
in his first season at the @entity64 , where he went from ball boy to legend , @entity33 won every competition they competed in			0
he lifted 14 trophies during his stint with his hometown club but when he left , while there was plenty of sadness , few did not believe it was the right decision with nemesis @entity98 polishing a first @entity114 trophy in four years at the @entity166			0
at @entity2 , he lifted the @entity121 in his first season on a playing field about as level as the nearby @entity169 and looks set to do so again but will that be enough ? @entity7 gives instructions to @entity2 's @entity171 during their @entity17 defeat @entity7 's teams have won just four times , drawing eight and losing five , in 17 matches away in @entity92 if @entity2 were to turn it around next week then it would be up there with @entity7 's best achievements would @entity181 , used to grinding out results with less talent at his disposal and suddenly available , be a better candidate ? it is unlikely the powers that be at @entity11 will think so as , playing style aside , there are other reasons why @entity7 is the preferred choice			1
as he 's shown more than once , @entity7 is not afraid to move big , ageing names on , something that would be music to the ears of the @entity195 faithful			0
at the @entity64 he showed the likes of @entity197 , @entity198 and none other than a certain @entity200 the door			0
his belief that reputations count for nothing , shared by another manager currently plying his trade in @entity5 , could be just what @entity11 need			0
@entity181 is another who has been linked with a move to the @entity30 the @entity212 manager confirmed he will be leaving the @entity15 club at the end of the season			2

@entity3 3 - 1 @entity2 : click here to read @entity219 's match report
@entity7 's side were beaten in the @entity17 quarter - final
the @entity2 manager remains first choice to replace @entity13
@entity181 confirms he will leave @entity212 in the summer
