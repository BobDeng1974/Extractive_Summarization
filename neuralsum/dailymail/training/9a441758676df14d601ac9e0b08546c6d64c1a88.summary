he might be likely to get both his alien hearts broken by his new time - travelling companion , @entity3 ( @entity3 ) , but he 's full of the joys of spring			1
in this week 's wild and witty episode of @entity6 , he was kissing any girl who came within reach — a smacker on the forehead for @entity3 , a peck on the cheek for poor blind @entity13 , and a full - on scorcher on the lips for detective @entity16			1
she slapped his face , of course			1
just for form 's sake			1
but the romantic twist has been a welcome wake - up slap for a much - loved tv institution that was getting tired			1
the first half of this series , last autumn , sagged badly in the middle as the storyline about his two previous companions , @entity30 and @entity31 , trudged on			2
love suits : @entity33 and @entity3 , stars of @entity6 , have produced some zingers @entity30 was so wet , @entity31 was so impressed with herself , and the pair of them deserved to be parked permanently in a black hole			1
the @entity41 episodes , by contrast , are zingers			2
they crackle with fun and playfulness			2
and they are daring — the doctor did n't appear until 14 minutes into the story on saturday , and when he did it was a genuine shock			1
there were some good visual gags			2
investigating a mysterious @entity54 mill in 1893 , @entity3 broke into the cavernous engine hall to discover it was empty , apart from some gramophones playing the deafening sound of heavy machinery			2
for a flashback sequence , the doctor — in tweeds and a high - crowned @entity63 hat — appeared in flickering sepia , as if shot on a hand - cranked motion picture camera			2
and best of all , when @entity16 took on a gang of brainwashed @entity70 thugs , she stepped out of her crinolines to reveal a leather cat - suit — just like @entity73 in the cult @entity75 series , @entity76			0
it was no coincidence that the actress who played @entity79 was cast here as the villainous mrs @entity80 — dame @entity81			0
the @entity82 was splendidly nasty as a temperance campaigner with a gigantic red leech from the @entity86 era suckling blood on her breastbone			0
' @entity91 pleasure ' : @entity92 as @entity93 in the @entity96 inspector @entity95 prequel @entity97 but the best lines went to @entity16 , the alien consulting - detective @entity16 and the psychotic @entity100 valet , @entity16			1
as the trio leapt into a @entity103 cab in @entity104 , @entity16 reminded them of the dangers that lay ahead : ' i strongly advise the issuing of scissor grenades , limbo vapour and triple blast brain splitters			0
remember , we are going to the @entity113 ! ' with @entity115 over and the @entity116 brought to an untimely end by the death of actress @entity119 , there is space in the schedules for a new @entity6 spin - off			1
these three characters deserve their own crime series — @entity16 is a scaly green version of @entity126 , @entity16 is her @entity127 and @entity16 is a lunatic mrs @entity128			0
good spin - offs are sheer pleasure , as @entity97 has proved			1
like @entity6 , this prequel to the crime classic @entity95 is television you can watch twice — once for the story , and again for the details			1
watch carefully , and you spotted a push - along carpet cleaner , which was no more than a rotating brush and a pan on the end of a stick : we all had those , stored upright like a broom in the cupboard under the stairs			0
and short trousers on a snowy day : little boys were n't allowed to wear long trousers until they were 11 , and never mind if it was below freezing ... good for the circulation			0
i spotted only one detail that would have made the set more authentic — in the newspaper office , the reporters had battered @entity159 typewriters , but no sheaf of discarded papers on a metal spike where unwanted articles were left to die a death			0
the spike was the ultimate elf ' n ' safety horror : ask any journalist of a certain vintage , and we 'll tell you tales of hacks who spiked their own hands , elbows and even heads			0
such scratches would mean nothing to young @entity95 , who during this short series has been stabbed , has almost fallen from a college roof , and who last night was shot in the hip			0
another detail is revealed — now we know why , in later life , @entity95 was troubled by an old wound that made him limp			0
take a note of that , sergeant .			0
