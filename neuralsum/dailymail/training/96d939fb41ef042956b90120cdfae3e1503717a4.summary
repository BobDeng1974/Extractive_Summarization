but it has now been revealed that @entity9 , played by @entity10 in the film franchise , was based on a teacher novelist @entity12 hated from her school days			1
the author said the malicious character , who is just as fond of pink fluffy cardigans and kittens as she is of barbaric teaching practices , was inspired by a woman she ' disliked intensely on sight '			1
ms @entity12 did not reveal the identity of the woman , but said she had been her teacher or instructor ' long ago â€¦ in a certain skill or subject '			1
' the woman in question returned my antipathy with interest , ' she wrote on her @entity46 website			0
' why we took against each other so instantly , heartily and ( on my side , at least ) irrationally , i honestly can not say			0
professor @entity9 is remembered as the ' toad - faced ' @entity2 professor who forced @entity3 to cut the words ' i must not tell lies ' on to his hand , pictured in the @entity53 @entity12 said she feels the ' purest dislike ' for the teacher as her desire to control , punish and inflict pain in the name of law and order rivals @entity34 's incarnation of evil ' what sticks in my mind is her pronounced taste for twee accessories			1
i particularly recall a tiny little plastic bow slide , pale lemon in colour that she wore in her short curly hair			0
' i used to stare at that little slide , which would have been appropriate to a girl of three , as though it was some kind of repellent physical growth			0

ms @entity12 was quick to point out that the teacher she based the character on was not sadistic or vicious to her or anyone else			1
' i never heard her express a single view in common with @entity9 ( indeed , i never knew her well enough to know much about her views or preferences , which makes my dislike of her even less justifiable ) , ' she said			2
' however , it is true to say that i borrowed from her , then grossly exaggerated , a taste for the sickly sweet and girlish in dress , and it was that tiny little pale lemon plastic bow that i was remembering when i perched the fly - like ornament on @entity9 's head			2
' the author also revealed she shared an office with a woman who covered the wall with pictures of fluffy kittens , but was also a bigoted champion of the death penalty			0

' i once shared an office with a woman who had covered the wall space behind her desk with pictures of fluffy kitties ; she was the most bigoted , spiteful champion of the death penalty with whom it has ever been my misfortune to share a kettle			0
