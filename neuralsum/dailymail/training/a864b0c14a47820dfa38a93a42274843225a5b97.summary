this year , @entity17 won bronze disbelief : @entity7 , pictured hugging @entity17 , said the @entity18 were never on her radar ' but with rookie skits and everything else , she really broke out of her shell			1
it 's hard when you 're 15 , but she 's doing an amazing job			2
' before her daughter 's astonishing feat , @entity149 said it was this social aspect of the @entity18 that @entity7 was enjoying most , but that they had no expectations for anything more - like a medal			1
' she loves being on the team and really appreciates and respects the vets on the squad , ' mrs @entity7 , who is in @entity99 to watch her daughter , said			2
