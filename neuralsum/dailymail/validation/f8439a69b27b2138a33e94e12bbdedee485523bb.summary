an angry mother claims her daughter found a broken security tag lying inside her morning cereals			1
@entity4 said six - year - old @entity5 had cut her finger on the jagged metal tag as she went to open the box of @entity9 at their home			1
the 34 - year - old , who bought the @entity14 cereals from @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity17 , said it posed a major choking hazard to her daughter who had initially believed it was a free toy			1
@entity4 said her six - year - old daughter @entity5 had cut her finger on the jagged metal tag as she went to open the box of @entity9 both @entity15 and @entity14 have refused to take responsibility for the dangerous blunder			1
mrs @entity4 , who lives in @entity27 , @entity17 , with @entity5 , eight - year - old @entity25 and her husband @entity26 , 45 , said : ' both my daughters thought it was a toy as it 's got moving parts and could swivel			1
' the end of the tag is really sharp like a pin , but it 's got a sharp broken wire at the other end too			1
' kids thinking it 's a toy are going to be spinning it round and they could get hurt			0
' neither @entity15 or @entity14 are owning up to it , that 's what annoys me			1
' the full - time mother said she had called @entity14 over concerns that such a sharp piece of metal could get past their quality tests			2
the 34 - year - old said it posed a major choking hazard to her daughter who had initially believed it was a free toy ' i just wondered how on earth it had got in there , ' she added			1
' i phoned them to express my concerns , but all they seemed to want was the box sent to them , and to reimburse me for the postage and have it forgotten about			0
' i refused that initially as i thought it was too dangerous an item to just forget about it and brush it under the carpet			0
' it just makes you wonder whether products are being checked thoroughly , especially for things that could be a choking hazard to children			2
' but @entity14 hit back , passing the blame back to @entity15			2
a spokesman said the find was ' a security tag that retailers use on high value products			0

the security tag , which was broken and sharp like a pin on one side , while the other had a jagged broken wire ' our packing technology is highly automated and we have strict procedures in place including metal detection on the sealed products			0
' we are confident that it did not leave out site with that tag in there			0
' @entity14 are now planning to launch an investigation liaising with the retailer			0
however , @entity15 claimed that the tag had been found in a sealed box and therefore could only have been added in the manufacturing or packing process			2
a spokesperson for the supermarket , where the cereal was purchased , said : ' we 're at a loss to understand how this happened , as all products are packed and sealed at the manufacturers ' ' we 're happy to assist @entity14 with their investigation			0
