graduates who scrape a third class degree are to be offered bursaries to train as teachers following a u-turn by the @entity6			1
funding for teacher training was withdrawn from anyone with the lowest class of honours degree two years ago because @entity12 wanted to improve the calibre of applicants			1
the move put @entity16 alongside high - performing countries such as @entity18 and @entity19 which recruit top scholars			2
scraping by : graduates who get the lowest class of honours degree will be eligibile for government funding but he has had to relax the ban in maths and physics because of a collapse in the number of candidates			1
there were 709 teacher training vacancies in maths last year – around a third of the total spaces available			2
the shortfall in physics was 386			0
under one of mr @entity12 ’s key reforms , thousands of graduates are now training in schools rather than going through a teacher training college			1
critics claim that this approach is too fragmented and making it more difficult to analyse the numbers going into different subjects and predict the correct number of trainees needed for different areas			0
but supporters of the reform say that it allows schools a greater say in how teachers learn their craft - and removes them from the ‘ damaging ’ influence of left - wing courses at colleges that favour trendy methods			0
mr @entity12 wants more than half of teachers trained in schools by 2015			1
from next year , bursaries of £ 9,000 will be offered to graduates with a ‘ relevant degree ’ to entice them into teaching maths or physics			1
they must also have a b grade or higher at a-level in the subject they plan to teach			0
the decision will add to concerns about the quality of teaching in classrooms			0
u-turn : @entity12 removed the bursaries for third - class students two years ago , but they are now to be reinstated experts have previously warned that pupils are falling behind in subjects including maths at primary school because many teachers only have a gcse c grade in the subject			1
earlier this month the @entity91 complained classroom support staff were increasingly being asked to stand in for teachers			0
mr @entity12 has also faced criticism from @entity95 for allowing academies and free schools to use unqualified teachers – even though the party ’s education spokesman @entity99 and his predecessor , @entity101 , have both taken classes in their constituencies			2
but there is increasing pressure for sufficient teachers in key subjects such as maths and physics since top universities indicated their preference for applicants with traditional a-levels			0
official figures show a surge in the number of teenagers taking them at @entity118 and @entity72			0
an @entity120 report last week also revealed shockingly poor levels of numeracy in @entity16 compared with global rivals			0
bursaries are also being increased in maths and physics for trainee teachers with higher degrees			2
graduates with a 2:2 will be eligible for £ 15,000 instead of £ 12,000 and those with a 2:1 will receive £ 20,000 , up from £ 15,000 - bringing them into line with applicants holding a first class degree			2
schools minister @entity134 said bursaries were rising in other subjects – although candidates will continue to need at least a 2:2 degree to qualify			1
@entity139 will not be available for low - priority subjects such as art and business studies			0
a @entity144 spokesman said : ‘ smaller bursaries will be available for graduates with a relevant degree and a good a-level in maths or physics who show real potential to be brilliant teachers			1

bursaries to be offered in *exchange* for the worst possible honours degree
they are designed to tempt those with ' relevant ' degrees into the *profession*
@entity12 removed the bursaries for two years ago to raise *standards*
but the sheer lack of appropriate candidates has forced a u-turn
