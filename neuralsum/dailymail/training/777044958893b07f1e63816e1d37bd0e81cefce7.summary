abusive dating behavior is pervasive among @entity2 's adolescents , according to a new survey			1
the federally funded survey says a majority of boys and girls who date describe themselves as both victims and perpetrators			1
sponsored by the @entity10 , the @entity11 on @entity12 and intimate violence was conducted by @entity14 at the @entity15 , a prominent research center which provided preliminary results to @entity17			1
not a game : a majority of boys and girls who date describe themselves as both victims and perpetrators of abuse input came from a nationwide sample of 667 youths aged 12 - 18 who 'd been dating within the past year and who completed a self - administered online questionnaire			1
nearly 20per cent of both boys and girls reported themselves as victims of physical and sexual abuse in dating relationships - but the researchers reported what they called a startling finding when they asked about psychological abuse , broadly defined as actions ranging from name - calling to excessive tracking of a victim			1
more than 60per cent of each gender reported being victims and perpetrators of such behavior			1
the survey found no substantive differences in measures by ethnicity , family income or geographic location			1
@entity52 , one of the two lead researchers for the survey , acknowledged that some of the behaviors defined as psychological abuse - such as insults and accusations of flirting - are commonplace but said they should n't be viewed as harmless			1
' none of these things are healthy interactions , ' she said			0
' it 's almost more of a concern that our gut reaction is to accept this as natural			0
' the @entity68 , in its campaigns against teen dating violence , also stresses the potential seriousness of psychological abuse			2
' teens often think some behaviors , like teasing and name calling , are a " normal " part of a relationship , ' says a @entity68 fact sheet			2
' however , these behaviors can become abusive and develop into more serious forms of violence			0
' @entity81 , the other lead researcher for the @entity14 survey , said the overall abuse figures were higher than previous national studies of dating abuse , revealing ' the startlingly widespread nature of this problem			1
' using a definition under which adolescent relationship abuse can occur in person or through electronic means , in public or private , and between current or past dating partners , the survey estimates that 25 million @entity2 adolescents are victims and nearly 23 million are perpetrators			1
mr @entity81 and ms @entity52 said the high rates in their survey may stem in part from youths being candid due to the privacy of the online format			2
they also suggested that dating abuse is now so common that young people have little concern about admitting to it			2
the survey found fairly similar rates of victimization and perpetration among boys and girls - even in the sub-categories of physical abuse and sexual abuse			1
many previous studies have found that girls are markedly more likely to be victims of physical and sexual dating abuse than boys			1
survey says : input came from a nationwide sample of 667 youths aged 12 - 18 who 'd been dating within the past year however , the researchers detected a shift as adolescents age			2
' we found that girls perpetrate serious threats or physical violence more than boys at ages 12 - 14 , but that boys become the more common perpetrators of serious threats or physical violence by ages 15 - 18 , ' they wrote			2
@entity52 noted that the questionnaire did not delve into such details as which party instigated a two - way confrontation , or whether injuries resulted			0
she said it was possible girls suffered more serious injuries than boys			0
' our work suggests that prevention programs need to address both victimization and perpetration , not one or the other , ' ms @entity52 and mr @entity81 wrote			0
they recommended starting prevention programs in middle school , and noted that that teen dating violence is viewed as a possible precursor to adult intimate - partner violence			0
@entity158 , a health scientist with the @entity68 's violence prevention division , said two - way teen dating violence - with both partners engaging in abuse - is widespread			2
she said it 's an ongoing challenge among experts in the field to find the right balance in addressing the role of gender - exploring the extent to which both boys and girls are perpetrators , while identifying situations where girls are likely to suffer more serious harm			0
for example , ms @entity158 said that if a boyfriend retaliates against a girlfriend who hit him , there 's a higher risk of injury to the girl if - as is likely - the boy is stronger			0
dr @entity185 , chief of adolescent medicine at @entity187 , said it 's important to make distinctions about the types of abuse			0
she contends that , while boys and girls may engage in psychological abuse at comparable levels , girls are more likely to be the victims in cases of sexual violence and coercion			1
' when you look at the need for medical attention , females are experiencing more severe consequences , ' she said			0
' we 're doing ourselves a disservice if we pretend it 's all the same			0
' while many girls are capable of aggressive behavior , they generally do n't share the view of some boys that sexual coercion is acceptable , dr @entity185 said			0
the research by @entity217 and mr @entity81 is expected to be published soon in @entity218 , a peer reviewed academic journal .			0

a survey at the @entity15 also found that 20per cent of teens reported themselves as victims of physical and sexual abuse in dating relationships
