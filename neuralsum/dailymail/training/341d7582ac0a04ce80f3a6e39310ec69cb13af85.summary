by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 07:48 est , 15 november 2013 updated : 17:11 est , 15 november 2013 speech : @entity4 mep @entity3 wants to take the argument for a @entity6 of @entity7 ' to the streets ' @entity4 should use next year ’s @entity10 elections to campaign for a @entity6 of @entity7 , a senior @entity3 has urged			1
in a rallying cry to pro-federalists , @entity3 will tell an audience in @entity14 tomorrow that @entity15 is wrong to try to claw back powers and instead argue @entity17 must hand even more control and money to @entity20			1
standing down as president of the @entity22 , he will also insist there is ‘ nothing inherently undemocratic ’ about the way the @entity26 is run at the moment			0
mr @entity3 , an mep for the @entity28 , will claim that next year ’s elections to the @entity30 are ‘ crunch time ’ to ‘ campaign for the federal @entity7 which we espouse ’			1
the extraordinary pitch to voters comes at a time when the anti-eu @entity17 @entity37 is expected to top the polls in @entity17			2
pro-federalists have to persuade the ‘ those who hold the reins of national power to realise their relative impotence ’ , mr @entity3 will say			1
but he does have the self - awareness to admit that ‘ it would be naive for those of us who wish to strengthen the firepower of the @entity26 to expect to be loved for what we do and say ’			0
he adds : ‘ the federalist argument has to be won not just in academic and official circles , and with the markets , but also democratically , even on the streets			0
’ in a speech to the 24th also takes aim at mr @entity15 , who has vowed to claw back powers from @entity20 before holding an in - out referendum by 2017			1
‘ the rise of nationalist forces , and so - called " eurosceptics " who march to the beat of the nationalist drum , has continued , ’ mr @entity3 will say			1
‘ @entity15 may be able to peddle his defeatist prospectus of a weaker , looser confederation of nation states ; but we now have our optimistic prospectus of a strong , democratic federal union of states and citizens			2
‘ already the temptation to disintegrate , to dismantle what has been achieved over the last decades , risks overwhelming the @entity17			0
’ instead mr @entity3 calls for the @entity17 government to give up more of its public spending and hand it to the ‘ @entity7 treasury ’			2
he goes on to call for a ‘ general revision ’ of all @entity26 treaties with a view to restoring ‘ full democratic legitimacy to the project of building a united @entity7 ’			0
struggle : mr @entity3 argues @entity17 and other national governments must hand more power and money to @entity7 treasury the remarks were quickly condemned by @entity90 leader @entity89 , who told @entity1 : ' we should never forget that despite how discredited the political and economic reality has shown their ideas to be , @entity26 nationalists like @entity3 are still pushing for a @entity6 of @entity7			1
' @entity90 will be aiming to win the @entity97 next year and we will seek to replace as many @entity99 , pro-euro meps from the old parties as possible with @entity90 @entity98 who stand up and say that @entity17 must leave the @entity26			1
' a @entity4 spokesman said : ' @entity3 is well known for his outspoken views on this issue			1
he was speaking in a personal capacity and definitely does not represent official party policy			0
' @entity4 will be pushing for a more accountable and efficient @entity26 in 2014 , focused on creating jobs and growth			0
' in extracts of his speech released today , mr @entity3 complains that national elected governments have demanded financial belt - tightening ‘ without stopping to consider for one moment the real added value and cost efficiencies which could be gained by a genuine transfer of some public spending from the national to the @entity7 budget and treasury ’			1
pledge : @entity15 has promised to negotiate a fresh settlement with @entity20 before holding an in - out referendum by 2017 mr @entity3 warns that pro-federalists are ‘ not very good at combating ’ the people who blame @entity20 for problems , but hails the controversial @entity124 as a ‘ large step forward ’ in the governance of the @entity26			1
mr @entity3 will say : ‘ in my view , there is nothing inherently undemocratic about any of the institutions of the @entity26 and nothing particularly malevolent about those who run them			2
‘ the greater problem is the absence of government by which i mean an efficacious executive authority with the capacity to act across the wide range of topics which today 's challenges throw up , and an executive authority possessing an armoury of instruments sufficient to deal with the complex challenge of integration			0
’ despite the @entity149 crisis and austerity sweeping the continent , @entity7 unity has survived intact , he will say			0
‘ not covered in glory , not making great strides to the federal constitutional settlement which we at @entity22 want to see			0
‘ not without social hardship , particularly among the young , not without losing out in international affairs but nevertheless the semblance of unity and the basic structure of the @entity26 has survived			0
’ however he warns of further unrest as the @entity149 battles to restore stability to the banking sector			0
‘ imagine the political reaction when ' @entity20 ' starts to punish share - holders and depositors by closing down banks not just in @entity171 but also here in @entity173			2
