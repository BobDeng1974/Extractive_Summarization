culture secretary @entity0 said there was ‘ no getting away ’ from the fact that the terrorists called themselves @entity4 @entity6 ’s first elected @entity4 cabinet minister has said it is ‘ lazy ’ to claim @entity8 had nothing to do with last week ’s terror attacks in @entity11			1
culture secretary @entity0 said there was ‘ no getting away ’ from the fact that the terrorists called themselves @entity4			1
mr @entity0 also called on @entity6 @entity4 to do more to tackle extremism – claiming they had a ‘ special burden ’ because so many of the attacks were carried out by fanatics who claim inspiration from @entity8			1
the former banker , who became the first @entity4 @entity22 mp after being elected in 2010 , attacked the ‘ barbaric ’ terrorists responsible for last week ’s atrocities			1
mr @entity0 said : ‘ the lazy answer from people out there is to say that this had got nothing whatsoever to do with @entity8 and @entity4 and that should be the end of that part of the debate			1
‘ that is lazy and that would be wrong			2
you ca n’t get away from the fact that these people are using @entity8 , they are taking a great religion , a peaceful religion of a billion people around the world , taking this religion and using it as their tool to carry out their horrible activities			2
’ mr @entity0 said because of this there was a ‘ special burden ’ on @entity4 to deal with @entity8 extremism			1
he said : ‘ all communities can do more to try and help and deal with terrorists , try and help track them down , but i think it is absolutely fair to say that there is a special burden on @entity4 communities , because whether we like it or not , these terrorists call themselves @entity4			1
‘ it is no good for people to say they are not @entity4 , that is what they call themselves			1
they do try to take what is a great peaceful religion and warp it for their own means			0
’ mr @entity0 said that the government 's anti-terror legislation needed to be stronger			1
he said : ‘ actually , ever since 9/11 , and the terrible bus bombings in @entity67 , @entity65 has taken this issue seriously			2
‘ there have been a number of measures to de-radicalise and prevent radicalisation in the first place , and the question is , does it need to be tougher ? i think the answer is yes			2
armed @entity11 military on the streets at @entity78 today - the end point of today 's ' unity rally ' against extremism up to a million people are expected to attend today 's march in @entity84 following last week 's terror attacks the culture secretary also rejected the suggestion that @entity65 should step in on matters involving newspaper articles deemed to be offensive			2
the former banker said : ‘ most people would accept in our country just as in any free country , we have a balance of laws that are there to protect people but also to protect their right to freedom of speech and freedom of expression			0
that is absolutely vital , that is something we can never let go of			0
" when a newspaper decides to do , or a magazine or tv channel for that matter , it is up to them , it has got nothing to do with the government			0
‘ people can still object to something they do n't like in a paper or magazine , but that does n’t mean to say that it ca n’t be published			0
that is freedom , that is how it works			0
‘ there is no role for government to tell any media organisation what they should or should not publish			0
it is what makes us such a special society			0
" home secretary @entity129 ( second right ) was in @entity84 today alongside the @entity11 president @entity131 mr @entity0 ducked a question on whether the @entity6 threat level was likely to be raised , saying those decisions were for security professionals			1
he said : ‘ we remain vigilant at all times , naturally and if the threat level changes than that is a decision by the professionals			0
‘ what we have seen though in recent days as well is through @entity143 we have had the counter terrorism bill going through , which i think is a demonstration of even while these acts were unfolding in @entity84 , we were debating these issues in @entity143 and making sure our security forces , our police , have the tools that they need to do the job			0
‘ i think most people would accept that you need to make sure that the laws that you have , some that you have relied on in the past , are kept up to date , and especially in the face of modern technology			0
