@entity1 lock @entity0 insists the @entity2 can finish their @entity3 off on a high if they can stretch their 20 - minute blitz against @entity5 to an 80 - minute onslaught			1
@entity8 's men host @entity9 on saturday knowing defeat will leave them with a disastrous whitewash for the third time in 11 years			2
but @entity15 forward @entity14 is taking hope from the promising spell at the end of the first half last weekend where his side stormed back from @entity22 's early score to grab a 13 - 10 half - time lead			1
@entity0 believes @entity1 can take hope from their 20 - minute dominant spell over @entity5 on saturday @entity27 finished off a superb move before a pair of penalties from skipper @entity31 nudged them in front at the break			1
but @entity1 failed to add a single point after the interval and slumped to a 25 - 13 defeat in @entity38 as @entity5 stepped up a level			1
now @entity14 insists the @entity40 will only be able to dent @entity9 's title push next weekend if they can repeat their brief moment of dominance down south for the full match at @entity45			2
he said : ' it was a very , very fast test match on saturday - possibly the quickest i 've ever played			0
@entity5 came at us with huge pace and they moved the ball really well			2
@entity1 stormed back from @entity22 's early score to grab a 13 - 10 half - time lead at @entity54 ' their dangerous attacking players were pushing them forward and it took some exceptional defence from us a couple of times to stop them building a bigger lead in that first half			1
' but i thought we showed great character getting back into the game			0
we put pressure on them and started to play our own game			0
' we got the off - loads going and that 's how we got our try - we moved the ball and played quickly			0
' next week is a massive test and it 's important we do the same against @entity9 that we did in that second quarter against @entity5			2
@entity27 scores a try for @entity1 at @entity54 during the impressive spell that they hope to build on video 02 @entity80 : @entity5 v @entity1 match review ' that will be the big focus for us this next week			1
we 'll get a boost from going home to @entity87 in front of our own fans but we need to take the bar that we set with the good things we did at @entity54 and make that the standard for the whole 80 minutes			0
' it gives us something to build for and we can definitely take the positives from saturday 's match before hopefully ending the @entity97 on a high			0
' @entity14 says @entity1 will take the positives from saturday 's match as they aim to avoid the wooden spoon defeat in the @entity102 capital follows narrow losses to @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106 but despite that miserable set of results , @entity14 insists @entity1 are moving forward			1
he said : ' the coach spoke after the game in @entity38 about making the little improvements that will turn those tight losses into wins			0
' we have been giving ourselves chances			0
we led at @entity54 at half - time but we need to step up our level at bit more so we finish off these chances and do not let teams back at us			1
' @entity8 spoke about making little improvements that will turn tight losses into win , according to @entity14			0

@entity1 blitzed @entity5 to take half - time lead at @entity54 on saturday
but the hosts eventually came through to win @entity128 in 25 - 13 *victory*
@entity0 believes @entity40 can beat @entity9 if they repeat 20 - minute spell
lock is hoping his *country* can step up the pace to avoid wooden spoon
