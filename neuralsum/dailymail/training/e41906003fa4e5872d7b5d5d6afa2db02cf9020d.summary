@entity0 admits that the traditional , powerful @entity2 defender has become a dying breed – not just at @entity4 but throughout the @entity5			1
better pitches and a more cultivated approach to training in youth academies might have killed off the old - fashioned @entity2 centre - half in the tradition of @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity0 ’s current assistant , @entity14			1
indeed @entity0 believes @entity15 may be the last of a generation raised to defend aggressively – but he insists he still has hopes that his own troubled back four will eventually match the great @entity4 defensive teams of the past			1
@entity15 is the last of the traditional @entity2 central defenders , according to @entity0 @entity15 rises above @entity22 to head during @entity25 's 2 - 0 win over @entity26 on saturday @entity0 , whose team take on @entity28 today , having lost 3 - 2 in a particularly calamitous defensive performance last month at the @entity30 , said : ‘ young boys practice well on quality pitches , whereas before it was muddy and you could tackle and throw your body in - it created opportunities for defenders to work naturally on their defensive techniques			1
today it 's all more standing up there is less physical commitment because the quality of the pitches are much better			2
‘ the game has become more technical			0
you find more players who may have good technique			0
maybe as well our societies are less aggressive			0
in the football education system , you cultivate that intense desire less			0
it 's more about the quality of the technique and maybe that creates fewer defenders			1
’ asked whether the likes of @entity15 were the last of that kind of defender , @entity0 said : ‘ @entity15 is a coach on the pitch			1
he 's a @entity12 , basically , ( who ) organises the team , because he has huge experience now and because he reads the game well			2
' maybe @entity64 in five , six , seven years will be like that as well			0
he is the right age , and you do not find many any more			0
you had more before than you do today			0
’ @entity4 boss @entity0 with former captain @entity12 lifting the @entity5 trophy in 1998 @entity0 believes that @entity25 's @entity64 could also be on the same level as the likes of @entity15 and @entity12 and @entity0 concedes that developing communication between a multi-cultural back four has proved much more difficult than in the days when he had @entity73 and @entity14 at centre half with @entity75 and @entity76 at full back			1
‘ certainly , you had more ( leaders ) before , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ if you look at the evolution of @entity2 football , when i arrived here , the back four all was @entity2			1
they were not only @entity2 , they communicated because they had the same culture , the same way to see the game , they were educated together and communication is an important part			2
‘ with people coming in from different countries , communication has gone from the back four , much more than before , and you see less people who talk			2
it does n’t mean there are no leaders but they do not speak always the same language , they are not the same way to respond to situations			0
that has a little bit gone in our game			0
’ @entity4 's legendary central defensive partnership of @entity14 ( left ) and @entity12 @entity0 believes that current partnership @entity108 ( left ) and @entity110 can reach their level that said , @entity0 ’s greatest back four , in the 1998 - 99 season , which conceded just 17 goals , finished second to @entity115 in the @entity5			1
@entity0 always remains peeved that no - one refers to his own creation , the @entity125 back four of @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity121 , which conceded 26 goals in their unbeaten season of 2003 - 04			1
‘ we had a great defence after that , nobody spoke about that : the invincible team			2
@entity118 , @entity120 , @entity119 , @entity121 was a top back four			2
’ and @entity0 remains convinced that the current back four of @entity133 , @entity108 , @entity110 and @entity134 can still become a unit that could compare with those teams			1
‘ i think we are not far			0
it ’s not only [ that ] , i think we have more offensive players in midfield than we had at the time			0
it ’s not only the back four , i think the whole defensive unit , we are more offensively oriented than we were at that time			0

traditional powerful @entity2 defenders are dying out , says @entity0
@entity4 boss believes @entity15 is last of his kind in his generation
@entity0 also concedes developing multi-cultural defence is far more difficult than when he had an all - @entity2 back four
convinced that @entity4 's current back four can rival his great defences
