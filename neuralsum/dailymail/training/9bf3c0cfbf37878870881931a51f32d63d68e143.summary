@entity0 is sat on the @entity2 team bus as it rolls victorious beneath @entity5 ’s famous @entity4 and past the black and white faces burning red with fury			1
with celebratory music dialled to the max , @entity0 and his comrades are not exposed to the venom being hissed in their direction			1
for those on the inside , there is relief , for those on the outside , rage			1
@entity0 finds the net during @entity2 's 3 - 0 win against @entity5 at @entity23 in february the winger also scored in the 3 - 0 win at @entity23 in april 2013 ‘ it ’s better when you win away , ’ says the player who has scored in both of @entity2 ’s back - to - back 3 - 0 victories at @entity23 and is bidding for an unprecedented fourth straight win over their rivals on sunday			1
‘ afterwards , you realise you ’ve done it , the music is turned up and you ’ve won the game			2
you get on the bus and you can see everybody there is fuming			2
that ’s the best part			2
it just makes it a better feeling winning in front of their fans			0
’ for @entity0 , the satisfaction of recent derby victories has been amplified by his team ’s perilous position near the bottom of the @entity49			1
this time , their situation is not so dire			0
there is , however , always the fear of defeat			0
‘ it is an intensity , ’ says the @entity56 - raised @entity2 fan as he describes what it is like to have played in four @entity60 clashes			1
@entity0 admits the best thing about beating @entity5 away is seeing the @entity64 supporters fume it was @entity0 's striker that caused then manager @entity68 to slide on his knees in clebration ‘ you can feel that little bit more expectancy			1
there ’s a pressure going into the game			0
when you get onto the pitch , if you did n’t know it was a derby , you can tell straight away			1
‘ there is a completely different feeling			0
it is like a cup final			0
everything is just that little bit extra and you get that from the fans			0
they make it that way			0
‘ they are nervous , they want to do well , but there ’s almost a fear attached to it as well			0
that ’s exactly what it is , fear ; everyone wants to win it that badly			2
that is how i would probably describe it			0
’ @entity0 ’s record in the fixture reads won three , drawn one			1
it was he who provoked @entity68 ’s touchline slide and fist pump in front of the @entity5 fans when he curled home a delightful second in the 3 - 0 triumph of april , 2013			1
ten months on and he was again doubling his side ’s advantage , this time with a close - range poke at the @entity119 as @entity120 became the first manager in 46 years to record a double over the @entity123			2
@entity0 falls under the challenge of @entity125 to earn a penalty against @entity127 last weekend @entity0 ( left ) celebrates with @entity128 after the @entity130 scores from the spot against @entity127 ‘ those goals are up there with the best in my career , ’ says the 27 - year - old former @entity133 winger			1
‘ but i think what made it more special over the last couple of seasons is that we really needed the points			0
we needed the wins regardless of whether it was the derby			2
‘ we can maybe go into it a bit more relaxed this time			0
i do n’t think there ’s so much pressure on us			0
the onus is all on them			0
’ @entity0 watched on wednesday night as @entity5 were soundly beaten 4 - 0 at @entity152 in the @entity154 semi-final			1
that result – coupled with their 4 - 1 defeat at @entity158 four days earlier – has raised the stakes for @entity161 boss @entity160 heading in to the derby			2
@entity163 ( centre ) tries to find a way past the @entity127 defence during saturday 's 1 - 1 draw it was only two months ago that he was fighting to save his job , a fact not lost on @entity0			1
‘ there is pressure on them and there has been pressure on the manager before their recent run , ’ he says , referencing the six wins in nine which have lifted @entity5 from bottom up to eighth			1
‘ we want to make sure the pressure is on them			0
we ’re aware they ’ve had a bad result but they are still a lot more points better off than us in the league			0
‘ having said that , we ’ll take anything we can that makes them tense and use it to our advantage			0
’ some of @entity0 's team - mates , however , are thought to be a little miffed at the latest comments of head coach @entity120			1
@entity0 is hoping to pile the pressure back on to @entity5 boss @entity160 with a win on sunday the @entity200 has bemoaned a lack of quality in his side and made a deliberate point of highlighting the shortcomings of his widemen			1
@entity2 have drawn 10 times this season – five of them goalless stalemates – and @entity120 says he is bored of watching his team play			1
@entity0 is too cute to be drawn on such issues , but does say : ‘ maybe we can create some better chances and then our finishing will be a bit better , but overall we have n’t been that bad			1
‘ the hardest part of football is scoring goals and winning games			0
sometimes you need to score two or three to win in the @entity49			2
’ score three is exactly what they ’ve done on their last two trips to @entity225			0
repeat the feat on sunday and even @entity120 might me smiling .			2
