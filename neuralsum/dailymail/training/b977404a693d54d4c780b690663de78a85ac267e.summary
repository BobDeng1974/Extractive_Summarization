by @entity1 reporter up to half a million @entity2 have faulty genes which put them at unusually high risk of developing heart disease or dying suddenly at a young age , a health charity estimates up to half a million @entity2 have faulty genes which put them at unusually high risk of developing heart disease or dying suddenly at a young age , a health charity estimates			2
years of under - diagnosing inherited heart conditions has seen the estimate shoot up from 380,000 , the @entity12 said , creating a deadly legacy that can span generations			2
the @entity12 also warned that someone living with an inherited heart condition has a 50 per cent chance of passing it on to their children			1
every year around 600 apparently healthy under - 35s die of heart attacks , leaving behind shocked and distraught families			1
now the @entity12 has launched its fight for @entity28 campaign to raise awareness and call for more research into faulty heart genes			1
@entity12 medical director professor @entity32 said : ‘ over recent years researchers have made great strides in identifying some of the genes that cause inherited heart conditions			2
‘ a genetic test in a child of an affected parent can save their life			0
more research is now urgently needed to identify all the genes responsible for these deadly disorders			0
‘ pinpointing genes which cause these conditions will allow affected children to be protected and , in the long term , will lead to new treatments to overcome the effects of the faulty gene			0
’ years of under - diagnosing inherited heart conditions has seen the estimate shoot up from 380,000 , the @entity12 said , creating a deadly legacy that can span generations the campaign , which launches on television and online today , features baby @entity59 whose mother @entity60 discovered that she had a faulty gene for an inherited heart condition before she became pregnant			1
she knew that there was a 50:50 chance it could be passed onto her baby			0
@entity59 might have the faulty gene but her condition is being monitored .			0
