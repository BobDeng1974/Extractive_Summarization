by @entity0 published : 18:02 est , 2 july 2013 updated : 01:46 est , 3 july 2013 sham ? homeopathic practitioners may be offering false hope and causing real harm homeopaths are putting patients at risk by discouraging them from seeking essential medical treatment , according to a damning ruling by watchdogs			1
practitioners have also been found guilty of making unproven health claims in a landmark decision by the @entity13 ( @entity13 )			1
an assessment of treatments and claims made by the @entity17 suggests practitioners are offering false hope and may be causing real harm			1
the ruling raises serious questions about the value of homeopathy , which has many well - known advocates , including @entity24 and health secretary @entity25			1
it will also reignite the row over why the @entity28 is spending £ 4million a year offering homeopathic remedies in the face of evidence that they do not work			0
the @entity13 tested a series of statements made by the society , and rigorous analysis by an independent expert found there was insufficient evidence to support the claimed benefits			2
homeopathy involves treating the patient with highly diluted substances , given mainly in tablet form			0
the idea is that even very low levels of substances , such as plant extracts , trigger the body ’s natural system of healing			0
but research has shown that the level of the substances offered to patients are so small – or even non-existent – that they can not have a biological effect			2
practitioners have also been found guilty of making unproven health claims in a landmark decision by the @entity13 ( @entity61 ) most worrying is the concern that people who rely on homeopathic remedies are being diverted away from conventional treatments which could offer genuine benefits			1
the society ’s website said evidence existed to show homeopathy can treat a wide range of ailments			0
but the @entity13 said several of these – bronchitis , osteoarthritis and vertigo – were conditions for which medical supervision should be sought , rather than relying on homeopathy			0
consequently , it said the claims were a breach of its advertising codes			0
the ruling raises serious questions about the value of homeopathy , which has many well - known advocates , including @entity24 ( pictured ) and health secretary @entity25 significantly , it said the evidence supplied by the society to back up its claims was not strong enough , and ruled that the claims were ‘ misleading and had not been substantiated ’			1
the independent expert said the evidence presented by the society was ‘ not convincing in terms of efficacy and it was unlikely to be generally accepted by the scientific community ’			0
the @entity13 has warned the society to stop making claims that are not supported by good @entity101 chairman @entity100 insisted that evidence did exist for the benefits of homeopathy , but that the society was prepared to change the way it marketed treatments .			2
