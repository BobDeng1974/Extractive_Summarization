the country has been condemned by gay rights activists for passing a law banning ' homosexual propaganda ' which critics say has led to a spate of homophobic attacks			0
celebrities such as @entity72 have asked nations to boycott the events , and while athletes will be attending , many foreign leaders such as @entity76 and @entity77 will not be going			0
volunteers are now completing the final stage of preparations ahead of the @entity30 which start on friday some athletes , including the @entity84 speed skating team , are already practicing in the venues in @entity59 security fears have also plagued the run - up , with @entity89 rebels threatening suicide bombing attacks throughout the @entity30 , with @entity50 athletes warned not to wear their uniforms while arriving in case they are targeted			0
leaflets were also issued last week showing the face of a suspected female ' black widow ' terrorist , the wife of a dead rebel , who was thought to be in @entity99 and planning an attack .			0
