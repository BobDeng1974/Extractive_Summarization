' @entity0 took his oath with senior @entity55 @entity54 , bypassing the country 's chief justice , who was installed by @entity18 in a widely criticised move to expand his authority even more			1
@entity0 then swore in opposition leader @entity60 as the prime minister			1

he also accused @entity18 of corruption , a charge the president denied			0
@entity18 's power grew immensely after he defeated the @entity80 , using his huge popularity among the @entity26 , many of whom hailed him as a king			1
he used his parliamentary majority to scrap a constitutional two - term limit for the president and gave himself the right to appoint many top officials			0

' @entity0 split from his former ally @entity18 in november after a dispute over the way the former president appointed relations to senior government posts prompting concerns over corruption @entity18 , who was first elected in 2005 , had been widely expected to easily win his third term in office until @entity0 suddenly split away in november , gathering the support of other defecting lawmakers and many of the country 's ethnic minorities , making the election a fierce political battle			1
@entity18 was still thought to be tough to beat because he controlled the state media and has immense financial resources and popularity among the @entity26 majority			0
but polling was notably strong in @entity181 - dominated areas , where voting had been poor in previous elections			0
many @entity184 were believed to have voted heavily for @entity0 â€” not so much because they supported him but because they despised @entity18 so much			2
he not only crushed the @entity70 rebellion but also largely ignored @entity181 demands to heal the wounds of the fighting and years of ethnic divisions			0
muslims , the second - largest ethnic minority , also appeared to have voted against @entity18 , who was accused of backing ultranationalist @entity193 groups and turning a blind eye on @entity196 violence last june			0
as for the country 's @entity26 , which make up about three - quarters of the population , @entity0 's entry into the race gave them another credible option if they wanted @entity1 to move in a different direction .			1
