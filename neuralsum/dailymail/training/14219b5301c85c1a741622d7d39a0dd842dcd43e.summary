in 2005 , @entity0 was told she had between six and 12 months left to live			1
the @entity2 woman had tumours on her lungs and her lymph nodes and was told the cancer was inoperable because it was so close to her aorta			1
nine years later mrs @entity0 , 64 , is still alive – a feat she claims is thanks to the mostly raw , vegan diet that ' cured ' her cancer			1
now she runs seminars around @entity13 , retreats in @entity14 , and has released a book to teach other cancer sufferers that they can heal themselves by changing their diet			1
but one of @entity13 's leading oncologists warns it is ' dangerous ' to shun conventional medicine based on one woman 's personal experience			1
nine years later she is still alive mrs @entity0 pictured in 2004 , just before she was told she had a malignant melanoma that metastasised ' i do n't condemn anyone for exploring all sorts of options when they have cancer but i think they should explore conventional medicine and not go off someone else 's story , ' said @entity42 , ceo of @entity43			1
mrs @entity0 said when she found out she had cancer she was told she was not able to undergo chemotherapy or radiation			1
her doctor @entity47 , a registered gp who combines conventional medicine with alternative treatments , said mrs @entity0 had a malignant melanoma that metastasised			1
' it went from her skin to the lymph nodes in her chest behind her sternum , ' dr @entity47 said			1
' that 's why they could n't do chemo or radiotherapy on her , it 's not a good area to do that			0
' mrs @entity0 said she would n't have considered either option even if they had been available			2
the @entity2 woman , 64 , had tumours on her lungs and her lymph nodes and was told the cancer was inoperable because it was so close to her aorta			1
she is pictured in 2010 mrs @entity0 pictured in 2005 while she had cancer ' my husband beat cancer four years before i met him in 1984 , and he opened me up to a lot of pathways to natural healing , ' she said			1
' i did nothing except the diet , mediation and positive affirmations			2
' if we dealt with the cause and stopped eating so much junk food there would n't be so much cancer			2
' dr @entity47 said she believed mrs @entity0 's diet was ' a big part of ' why she got better			1
' she had a belief system that allowed her to get well , ' she said			0
' i see a lot of patients that choose not to go down that path [ of conventional treatment ] and it does happen [ that they get better ] , especially when people are n't given any other options			2
' i usually suggest people have an integrated approach and take the best of both worlds			0
' after her diagnosis , mrs @entity0 started a month - long eating program to get rid of the candida in her gut			1
she was already a vegan , but she also cut out sugar , fruit , coffee , alcohol , dairy , yeast and anything fermented			2
next , she embarked on a 28 - day cleanse , consuming fruit juices , vegetable broths and herbal teas only			0
after that was finished , she started following an 80 percent raw , mostly vegan diet – one that she still follows now			1
' my breakfast every morning is still the same , i have fruit salads and cashew cream , ' mrs @entity0 said			2
' i soak a cup of cashews for an hour or two or overnight then i put that in my blender with three cups of water and mix that up until it 's think and creamy			0
' now she still follows the 80 percent raw , mostly vegan diet says says ' cured ' her			1
pictured are raw tacos the 64 - year - old occasionally drinks a glass of wine , and if she eats out she might have a piece of cooked fish with some salad			2
mrs @entity0 says that five months after she started her diet program , she felt like her cancer was gone			1
' the tumours sticking out of my neck were gone totally , ' she said			0
mrs @entity0 's husband @entity146 helps her give seminars and run retreats out of @entity14 ' i used to get breathless , because it was on my lungs , and i no longer did			1
' i knew i was clean , i just knew			0
' a year later , she had a @entity153 scan and an mri to prove it			0
' i did n't want to , but my mother said " why do n't you get checked out , people are going to ask you " , ' mrs @entity0 said			2
' my doctor sent me to a surgeon and they just said " you 're clear "			0
' mrs @entity0 started getting contacted by people – some who had cancer and others worried they were going to get it – asking her for tips			1
in 2009 she decided to write a step - by - step guide			0
she says she knows of 30 people who have cured their cancer by following her methods – and estimates there are thousands of others out there who have bought her book that she 's never heard from			1
when mrs @entity0 received her diagnosis in 2005 she and her husband @entity146 , 69 , were in the middle of a court case because the property development company they ran was defrauded of $ 7 million			1
the couple lost everything and mrs @entity0 believes the stress of the ordeal contributed to her cancer			1
' through that process i stopped eating properly , i was eating too much cooked food , ' she said			0
' the stress got to me and i could n't believe these people we 're so dishonest			0
' now they live in a rental property in @entity196 and their main source of income is the retreat program they run out of @entity14 every couple of months			2
they rent out a property for a group of nine to 10 people , charging them $ 2347 each for the weekend , where they do meditation exercises and eat raw food			0
mrs @entity0 's ' raw @entity212 puddings '			2
she says that five months after she started her diet program , she felt like her cancer was gone the @entity215 also run seminars , with one scheduled in @entity217 in @entity218 later this month , and they have plans to travel around the country next year			1
' i always get letters from all over the place asking " are you ever going to come here ? " ' she said			0
the seminars cost between $ 28 and $ 147 – depending on how far the couple have to travel and whether food and recipe books are included			0
mrs @entity0 does n't have any health or science qualifications , and everything she teaches is based on her own personal experience			2
her husband is currently studying a bachelor of health science in naturopathy and muscular skeletal therapy			0
' one of the reasons why @entity29 is doing naturopathy is that as i get bigger out there and more well - known , he felt if he can do naturopathy then one of us has got a certificate in case we ever get questioned , ' she said			0
mrs @entity0 's ' raw ravioli ' , which she serves at retreats and seminars mrs @entity0 says she does n't charge the people who get in contact with her directly asking for advice – and only accepts money if they insist			1
' i do meals , i do @entity254 and i do n't charge anybody , ' she said			0
' the reason i do n't charge is that i feel that everybody that 's got cancer , when they 're searching to get well , all these people are waiting for them to walk in the door and take advantage of them because they 're sick			0
' if the integrity 's in what i do and they 're going to get well they 've got to believe in what i 'm giving to them and not what they 're paying for			0
' mrs @entity0 started getting contacted by people – some who had cancer and others worried they were going to get it – asking her for tips			2
in 2009 she decided to write a step - by - step guide mrs @entity0 also says that she is does n't tell people outright that they should n't undergo more conventional cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation – she just tries to steer them in another direction			1
' i 'm not going to tell people what to do , they 've got to make their own educated judgement , ' she said			0
' mind you i tell them they 've got to be crazy ... i would n't do it to my body			0
' the bottom line is i 'll try and convince them to focus on nutrition			0
' @entity43 ceo mr @entity42 warned cancer sufferers against following dietary programs such as mrs @entity0 's in place of conventional treatments			1
' i 'm obviously pleased that she 's well but i think everyone has got to look at what treatments are available , ' mr @entity42 said			0
' she 's told her story which is fine , but extrapolating that and saying everyone should abandon proven cancer treatments , to say everyone should try changing their diet instead , is dangerous			1
' mr @entity42 said two thirds of patients diagnosed with cancer today will still be alive in five years ' time , which is an improvement since 10 years ago			2
' even if the treatment worked what we do n't know is does it work one out of every two occasions , one out of every 100 ? ' he said			0
' i think people should explore options but i think they 've got to ask questions like how does this apply to me and how often does it work			0
