by @entity0 last updated at 4:48 pm on 5th october 2011 in an age of overpaid , badly - behaved sporting stars , amateur cricket has long remained a reassuringly calm oasis			2
so the sight of four players sitting on their own bowler to physically restrain him after a furious clash with the batsman had spectators aghast			2
the shocking incident – at the club where a big - hitting young @entity14 made his name by peppering nearby rooftops – saw the umpires take the drastic step of abandoning the match			1
just not cricket : @entity21 was the scene of unsightly behaviour during a match recently but after filing a report on the appalling scenes , the highly experienced pair were astonished to be told it was they who were being suspended – a decision one described as ‘ @entity31 ’			1
it left the @entity34 - based @entity33 – also graced by the likes of @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 over the years – facing a boycott by its officials next summer			1
the clash took place during a meaningless but bad - tempered end - of - season match between @entity21 and @entity44 on september 10			0
tempers were already bubbling over when @entity47 bowler @entity46 – believed to be the son of the club chairman – barged into an opposing batsman			1
‘ the bowler just lost the plot , ’ said one witness			0
‘ he tore his shirt off and came stalking down the pitch and began threatening the batsman			0
’ bat 's amazing : @entity14 playing for @entity59 , left , and pictured at @entity21 , aged 15 , right umpires @entity64 and @entity65 – both former public school teachers – felt they had no choice but to abandon the match , the first time this had happened in the league ’s 60 - year history			1
but after sending a report to @entity33 officials , they were notified by its secretary that they were being suspended indefinitely			1
yesterday mr @entity64 , who has umpired for 35 years , said he had been astounded by the ruling – which was n’t within the league ’s powers in any case			0
' the whole thing 's been like a stalinist show trial ' ‘ it was the worst behaviour i ’ve ever seen on a cricket field , ’ said the 63 - year - old			1
‘ with hindsight , we should have called the police and let them deal with it			0
‘ the whole thing ’s been like a stalinist show trial			0
we were n’t told action was being taken against us , and we have n’t been given reasons for our suspension			0
’ last night , however , the chairman of the league , @entity91 , who also headed the disciplinary panel , informed the umpires they were n’t suspended after all			1
promising they had his ‘ full respect ’ , he emailed both , asking : ‘ please accept my apologies if the incorrect impressions have emerged in this matter			0
’ but @entity101 , chairman of the @entity102 , said : ' it 's all very unsatisfactory			2
' the secretary should apologise and resign , otherwise we 'll have to take further action			0
' @entity107 said @entity46 had been suspended but would not say for how long .			2
