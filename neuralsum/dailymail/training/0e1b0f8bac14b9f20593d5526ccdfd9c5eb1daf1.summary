by @entity0 last updated at 12:30 pm on 29th november 2011 nearly 100,000 people are living with @entity2 in the @entity3 but a quarter of them are unaware that they have the disease , according to the @entity6			1
the latest figures show the number of sufferers has risen from 86,500 to 91,500 between 2009 and 2010			0
of the 6,660 people newly diagnosed with @entity2 in 2010 , half came forward for testing after a time when treatment should ideally have started			1
nearly 100,000 people are living with @entity2 in the @entity3			1
this electron micrograph shows how @entity2 ( orange ) invades healthy immune system cells early treatment boosts chances of living longer with the precursor to @entity20			1
of the 680 people with @entity2 who died in 2010 , two thirds had been diagnosed late			1
heterosexual men were the most likely to be diagnosed late , at 63 per cent compared with 39 per cent of gay men and 58 per cent of heterosexual women			0
the human immunodeficiency virus ( @entity2 ) attacks the body 's immune system , which we need to fight disease and infection			1
the virus specifically attacks @entity34 cells			0
although the body will try to produce replacements , the number will eventually decline and the immune system will stop working			0
once the person acquires a life - threatening condition , such as pneumonia , they are said to have the last stage of hiv - acquired immune deficiency syndrome ( @entity20 )			0
@entity2 is spread through bodily fluids - most commonly during unprotected sex			1
there is no cure but since the 1990s treatments have been developed to slow down the spread of the disease			0
this allows people to live with the disease for a very long time			2
in 2009 , the @entity54 estimated there were 33.4m people across the globe living with hiv / aids			0
in 2010 , more than 3,000 gay men were diagnosed with @entity2 - the highest ever annual figure			2
one in 20 gay men are now infected with @entity2 nationally , rising to one in 11 in @entity61			2
today 's data also suggests that a stigma is still attached to the condition , revealing that one in five people visiting a sexually transmitted infection ( @entity69 ) clinic in 2010 did not accept an hiv test			2
the @entity6 is recommending that , in areas where prevalence of @entity2 is high , testing should be offered in places where it is not currently the norm			1
testing should be offered to all people signing up with a gp and those admitted to hospital , but only with the patient 's permission			2
dr @entity84 , consultant epidemiologist and head of @entity2 surveillance at the @entity6 , said : ' @entity2 is an infection which can nowadays be treated and those diagnosed promptly can expect to experience similar life expectancy as an individual without the infection			2
' however , we are very concerned that a large number of people in the @entity3 are unaware of their @entity2 status and are diagnosed late			1
' we want to see increased access to hiv testing routinely offered in clinical settings such as new registrants at @entity99 and hospital general admissions , in areas of the country where rates of hiv infection are high			0
the cost of treating someone with @entity2 in the @entity3 is estimated to be around £ 18,000 per year when they are not showing any symptoms			2
this is based on the price of care as well as triple - drug antiretroviral therapy			0
however , it costs £ 21,500 to treat patients who are showing symptoms and £ 41,000 for those with full - blown @entity20			0
patients who have four drugs cost the @entity119 between £ 22,775 and £ 48,000 per year			0
the annual cost of providing @entity2 treatment and care in the @entity3 could be as high as £ 758m by 2013 , according to a study in @entity124			2
' we are also urging sexual health clinics to ensure that hiv testing is offered as part of a universal sexual health screen at every new attendance			0
' @entity131 , chief executive of the @entity132 , said : ' the number of people who do n't know they have @entity2 and are diagnosed late is a serious issue			1
' not only does it have a severe impact on health and reduce life expectancy , this largely accounts for the onward transmission of @entity2 as people are n't taking the necessary steps to avoid passing it on			1
' she added : ' people should n't be scared of hiv testing , but they should be scared of undiagnosed @entity2			1
' the advances in @entity2 treatment have been one of the biggest success stories in the 30 years since the virus first emerged , but too many people test too late and so fail to benefit from these drugs			1
' sir @entity154 , chief executive of the @entity155 , said : ' hiv rates in the @entity3 remain dangerously high and to bring them down we all have to take responsibility for our sexual health			0
' we ca n't just rely on partners , or chance , to keep sex safe			0
' the @entity6 has previously predicted that by 2012 there will be 100,000 people living with @entity2 in the @entity3			1
the study comes just ahead of @entity167 on december 1 .			0

one in four people with @entity2 do n't know they have the disease
one in five people offered @entity2 test have refused it
