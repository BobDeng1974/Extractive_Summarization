by @entity1 reporter published : 15:25 est , 17 may 2013 updated : 09:51 est , 18 may 2013 a @entity3 mother of two young boys who said she was battling cancer just a few years after a man was convicted of her rape , has been exposed as a total fraud			1
@entity9 , 38 , has been charged with fraud , false pretenses and using a computer to commit a crime after state police found no doctor who diagnosed the cancer			1
the charges come as a local man , @entity17 , who spent nearly 10 years in prison for her rape was released last year , after newly discovered evidence cast doubt on whether she 'd ever been attacked			1
fraudster : @entity9 ( left ) , 38 has been charged with fraud after appealing for money to fight her cancer after she also claimed she was raped , for which @entity17 ( right ) served almost 10 years in prison for @entity9 's community , which had come to admire her as the subject of a newspaper 's award - winning 2003 series about surviving a rape , rallied when her cancer diagnosis became public			1
churches sold @entity37 sub sandwiches and auction items to raise money			0
friends cut her grass , bathed her at her modest home and provided hot meals			0
an insurance company paid nearly $ 100,000 for hospice care			1
one of her close friends , @entity46 , spoke of the gift she gave @entity9 , in a bid to help give her hope in her time of need			2
' it was a little box , a very ornate box , to hold a prayer			0
she needed @entity55 to look over her , ' @entity57 said , recalling the 2008 lunch when she gave @entity9 the jewelry			2
' @entity9 was visibly touched			2
' @entity57 now ca n't help but wonder whether @entity9 was showing gratitude or simply perpetuating years of jaw - dropping deceit			1
' the fact that she 's lived this long is a miracle			0
but maybe it was n't a miracle after all			0
... i 'm just baffled			0
is she the biggest con artist in the state of @entity3 or the victim ? ' @entity57 said			0
the fraud case is n't @entity9 's only concern			1
in a neighboring county , she is charged with making a false report of rape just last year , even using makeup to create bruises			1
@entity9 ( pronounced @entity78 ' - len ) and her attorney , @entity79 , have not returned phone messages seeking comment			2
elaborate stories : in 2002 , @entity9 told police she had been raped in broad daylight in a store parking lot more than a year earlier - there was no evidence but a man was convicted the @entity1 went to a @entity90 address listed in court documents , but she no longer lives there			1
the two cases against @entity9 come years after she first emerged in the public eye in the @entity96 area , 60 miles northeast of @entity97			1
in 2002 , @entity9 told police she had been raped in broad daylight in a @entity100 store parking lot more than a year earlier			2
there was no surveillance video , physical evidence or witnesses			0
@entity17 , an off - duty @entity100 employee with a past sex - related conviction , was charged after @entity9 said her attacker , like @entity17 , had a skull tattoo			1
he was found guilty in 2003 and sentenced to at least 15 years in prison , an enhanced punishment because @entity9 said her attacker gave her a sexually transmitted disease			1
next , @entity9 told her story to the @entity113			2
she said she wanted people to see her as a ' victor ' , not a ' victim '			0
readers inspired by ' @entity119 ' , as the series was titled , started a fund to send her to community college			0
but it did n't take long for @entity9 's story to start unraveling			1
authorities learned she claimed to have been kidnapped and raped while visiting her parents in @entity127 , @entity128 , just months after the alleged parking lot attack back in @entity3			0
' my daughter likes to have a lot of attention , ' her father , @entity131 , told @entity127 officers in a 2001 police report that was n't uncovered until after @entity17 's trial			1
@entity131 told the @entity1 this week that he has n't spoken to his daughter in years and did n't know anything about her recent claims			0
after years of appeals , a judge in 2012 ruled that the police report could have changed the outcome of @entity17 's trial and ordered a new one , saying @entity9 appeared to have ' concocted incredible stories ' in @entity128			1
prosecutors dropped the case without a second trial , and @entity17 was freed in november			2
as @entity17 's appeals were moving through the courts , @entity9 was telling people she had developed cancer from a disease transmitted during the assault			1

it 's like a bad @entity177 movie , ' said event organizer @entity178			0
' i 've heard that some people want their money back			0
... i 'm working on forgiveness			0
' @entity182 , which visited @entity9 at her home , declined to comment on her care but said in a statement that any terminal illness typically ' must be certified ' by a patient 's doctor before services are provided			1
@entity9 's ex-husband , @entity190 , declined to comment on the criminal charges against his former wife , but divorce records indicate he had long doubted her tales of woe			1
the couple were married in 1993 , separated in 2007 and divorced in 2011			0
the marriage ' broke down due to the wife 's complex lies and deceit involving fictitious rapes , kidnappings , pregnancies and illnesses â€“ all attempts to control others by complaining of physical symptoms , ' @entity198 's attorney , @entity197 , said in a court filing			0
@entity9 told her husband the name of her cancer doctor , but he later learned there was no physician by that name in @entity3 , @entity197 said			1
and she would n't let him join her at medical appointments , even after driving hundreds of miles to @entity218 in @entity219 , @entity220 the clinic says @entity9 never was a patient there , according to records reviewed by the @entity1 psychologist @entity224 evaluated @entity9 as part of the divorce case and told the judge : ' often feeling dependent and dejected and fearful of rebuff , she may either withdraw from painful social relationships or decide to adapt the role of martyr			2
