a former chef 's identity was stolen by an online troll who used @entity4 to con people into believing his best friend , who was recovering from an illness , had died			1
@entity8 , 57 , from @entity9 in south @entity10 , was shocked to discover he had posted news of his friend @entity12 's death on the site - especially because he had never gone online in his life			1
the friends were on the @entity18 island of @entity19 on a two - week holiday when the message was posted , devastating family members			1
@entity12 's daughter @entity23 , 30 , was reduced to a ' sobbing wreck ' when she learned her father , who suffers a crippling stomach ulcer condition , was dead			1
dozens of friends paid their respects online and called his family before it was revealed to be fake			2
best friends @entity8 , left , and @entity12 , right , were on holiday when a troll posted a message on @entity4 in mr @entity8 name saying his friend had died mr @entity8 and mr @entity12 , 64 , who is nicknamed ' bones , ' have never owned a computer , set up an e-mail account or even set up landlines in their homes			1
despite this , when a page was created in mr @entity8 's name , accompanied by a recent photograph , claiming his friend had ' sadly passed away ' , nobody suspected it was false			1
the troll claiming to be @entity8 joined the @entity50 , a group highlighting the town 's attractions , to ensure hundreds of people saw the message			1
and the identity thief took down the post before police were able to examine it			2
the identity thief posted this message and joined a local page to ensure hundreds saw the post and paid tribute the troll also used a recent picture of mr @entity8 , from @entity9 , as a profile picture to convince friends mr @entity8 said : ' i 've never owned a computer or got a @entity4 page			1
i 've never even been online , and i definitely never will be now			0
' i 've got no idea where this person got the picture of me from and how or why they 're doing this			0
but it 's not the first time			0
' last year , the same con was used to make it appear mr @entity8 wished the death of a local soldier who had just been posted to @entity84			1
mr @entity8 said the troll 's attack , which has happened before , is ' character assassination ' ' somebody came up to me in @entity90 's , prodded me in the back in outrage and demanded to know what right i had to say such a thing , ' he said			1
' i 'd no idea what they were talking about and , quite understandably , it took a while to calm the person down			0
' i reported it to the police then , but nobody was ever caught			0
now the person is back and they seem intent on causing as much pain and misery as possible			0
' mr @entity12 added the attack was ' totally disgusting '			2
' @entity23 was absolutely hysterical thinking i was dead , ' he said			0
i 've not heard her cry like that since she was a little girl			0
' he added : ' that holiday was meant to be a pick - me - up			0
i 'd been in and out of hospital since @entity117 and had lost 4st			0
all this put the damper on things			0
' the fact i 'd been so ill and it appeared like @entity8 was making some announcement , after we 'd gone to @entity18 , made it seem all the more likely			2

a police spokesman said the case was being investigated			0
' the @entity4 account has been closed down , however , if any further posts appear we have advised that a screen shot be taken to help enable us identify who has set up this account in mr @entity8 name , ' he said .			1
