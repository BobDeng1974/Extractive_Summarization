thousands of schoolchildren 's education could have been threatened by a hardline @entity3 plot to force out moderate school governors and heads and replace them with extremists			1
it emerged today that 25 @entity9 schools are now being investigated for links to the alleged radicalisation plot , and while @entity12 has refused to name the schools , some of which have upwards of 600 students , it means that vast numbers of pupils could have been at risk			1
the number of schools allegedly involved rose today from 15 to 25 as education secretary @entity23 is said to have told @entity25 inspectors to fail any school ' where religious conservatism is getting in the way of learning and a balanced curriculum '			1
this afternoon deputy prime minister @entity31 backed the investigations , saying schools should not be allowed to become ' silos of segregation '			0
the unsigned and undated @entity49 letter claimed that a small but radical group of @entity55 was pursuing its own agenda in the classrooms , with uncooperative headteachers and governors forced out			0
it said that the plot had caused ' a great amount of organised disruption ' in the city , crediting it with forcing a change of leadership at four schools			2
at the centre of the scandal is @entity9 ’s @entity39 , where it is alleged that £ 70,000 was spent on loudspeakers to call pupils to @entity3 prayers			1
@entity12 's investigation will run beside a separate inquiry by the @entity75 ( @entity75 ) , and will report back on 15 schools initially next month , with a fuller report due in july			1
headteachers and governors judged to be performing ' inadequately ' in terms of pushing religious views to the detriment of children 's education may be immediately dismissed			0
since the appearance of the letter in march , anonymous whistle - blowers including former staff have come forward , making claims that boys and girls were segregated in classrooms and assemblies , and sex education was banned			0
it was also alleged that @entity97 staff had been bullied , and in one case it was alleged that the teachings of a firebrand @entity102 - linked @entity3 preacher praised to pupils			1
investigation : education secretary @entity23 , left , and @entity12 leader sir @entity105 , right @entity12 today announced the six - month appointment of mr @entity45 , managing director of @entity107 , to handle the investigation , and the council said it was also setting up a review group made up of mps , councillors , police and faith groups			2
the council 's leader , sir @entity105 , said the investigation was slowed by the two - tier school system , which meant that academies , which are at the centre of the allegations , were answerable not to the local authority but to the @entity75 , calling the situation ' frustrating in the extreme '			2
and sir @entity105 suggested that the alleged muslim extremist plot may extend beyond @entity9 , saying that his authority had spoken to councils in both @entity127 and @entity128			1
he said : ' there are certainly issues in @entity128 which have similarities with the issues being spoken about in @entity9			1
' fresh claims have emerged in @entity127 and at @entity128 's @entity134 and @entity135			1
an @entity25 spokesman said it had not begun inspections there , but did not rule it out			2
sir @entity105 also said that @entity143 , which has reopened a fraud inquiry into one of the schools caught up in the allegations , was still looking into the authorship of the @entity49 document , the authenticity of which is still unclear			2
@entity150 , the headteacher of @entity151 , said she would act against anyone plotting against the school one of the schools being investigated over extremist infiltration cancelled its annual visit from @entity159 last @entity160 , who organised the event at the secular @entity163 , was allegedly told to cancel it by the new @entity3 headmaster , @entity155 is said to have told her there would be no presents and ‘ no mention ’ of @entity170 being the son of @entity171 to a fellow teacher , mr @entity154 wanted to reduce festivities to little more than sing - alongs to songs such as @entity176 , but was forced to reinstate the @entity159 assembly by @entity12			1
however , @entity178 remained banned			0
but a @entity75 official said yesterday : ‘ extreme religious conservatism often acts as an entry to later problems			0
‘ a child who is brought up age eight , nine , ten , believing that you should segregate the sexes and hand out @entity3 textbooks is more likely to be radicalised in later life			0
’ @entity189 has promised ‘ swift action ’ to ensure schools are not used to spread terrorist ideology			0
@entity9 city council froze appointments of any new school governors last week			2
but @entity196 said change should have come sooner			0
@entity198 , @entity199 mp for @entity200 , which covers several of the schools , said the probe was moving at ‘ glacial ’ speed			0
@entity9 mp @entity204 said that the council has known of the claims for ‘ eight years at least ’ but had failed to act for fear of ‘ appearing @entity208 ’ .			0
