by @entity0 published : 16:07 est , 27 october 2012 updated : 04:49 est , 28 october 2012 @entity2 gave £ 840,000 to the family of the @entity5 engineer who was murdered with his wife in the @entity7 , it was claimed last night			1
the former @entity9 dictator is said to have deposited the sum in a @entity12 bank account in the name of @entity15 ’s father			1
the claim , which apparently originated with @entity18 intelligence , adds a sensational twist to the baffling case			0
cash deposit : @entity9 dictator @entity2 , left , is said to have deposited £ 840,000 into the bank account of murdered @entity15 's ( pictured right ) father @entity23 murder scene : @entity15 , his wife , @entity27 , and his mother - in - law were all killed in an isolated lay - by near @entity29 in @entity30 mr @entity31 , 50 , from @entity32 was killed along with his wife @entity27 , 47 , his mother - in - law and a @entity36 cyclist last month in an attack that left his seven - year - old daughter , @entity39 , badly injured , and her four - year - old sister @entity40 deeply traumatised			1
mr @entity31 ’s father @entity23 was once close to @entity2 ’s @entity42 , but fell foul of the tyrant in the @entity45 , and fled @entity9 for @entity5			1
the scene of the september 5 massacre – an isolated lay - by near @entity29 in @entity30 – is only an hour ’s drive from @entity49 where the money was deposited			2
@entity12 prosecutor @entity51 believes the family may have been returning from there when ambushed			2
tragedy : how the killings were reported at the time of the massacre it raises the possibility that mr @entity31 had managed to gain access to the account , which is thought to have remained in his father ’s name , and that this was known to his killer			1
the story was reported in the respected @entity36 newspaper @entity67			2
it said that a @entity36 police source had revealed that the money ’s source had been discovered by @entity18 intelligence agency @entity73			2
the agency ’s operatives routinely monitored the flow of cash to and from @entity78 as @entity18 did more business with the @entity2 regime than any other country			2
an intelligence source in @entity83 said last night : ‘ they know the money trail , and they know how to follow it			0
they have spent decades monitoring money transactions between the @entity88 and @entity9			0
the @entity73 is the first port of call in such circumstances			0
’ the @entity73 said they had no comment on the report , saying : ‘ we do not comment on operations			0
’ the @entity67 story was published under the headline : ‘ the potential links between the @entity98 and @entity2			0
’ it said : ‘ according to a @entity36 police source , the @entity18 secret service informed the gendarmerie ’s anti-terrorist branch that there were links between the @entity31 family and @entity2 ’s fortune			1
‘ the tensions began after @entity15 ’s father [ @entity23 ] was struck off the list of beneficiaries of the former @entity9 dictator			1
’ it has always been suggested that @entity23 ’s multi-million pound legacy – he died last year – led to conflict between @entity117 , who lived in @entity118 , @entity32 , and his brother @entity119 who lives in nearby @entity120			2
however @entity119 strongly denies there was any such feud			0
close ties : mr @entity31 's father @entity23 is believed to have been close to @entity2 's @entity42 but later fled for the @entity5 fall out : but @entity125 fell out with @entity2 in the seventies shortly after his murder , it emerged that @entity15 had put a block on his father ’s will , which effectively stopped his brother from inheriting his share until ‘ unknown ’ disputes were resolved			1
but @entity67 says it was the money in the @entity12 bank account – not the rest of the legacy – that may have caused friction between the two brothers			1
@entity12 investigators discovered the secret account earlier this month , but according to @entity67 they did n’t make the link to @entity9			1
mystery : it is still unknown why @entity15 , his wife and 77 - year - old @entity149 mother - in - law were killed specialist police were last week questioning @entity49 - based bankers about the @entity98 ’ assets , while financial records in countries including @entity155 have also been requested			1
@entity23 , a former factory owner , left @entity78 in the late seventies with his wife , @entity158 , and two boys , after allegedly falling foul of the @entity42			1
the family settled in @entity162 , @entity163 , later moving to @entity32			0
another theory is that @entity23 never fell out with the @entity42 at all – and that he was simply managing many accounts for @entity2 behind this smokescreen			1
shortly before the dictator was executed in 2006 , it was revealed that he withdraw around £ 620 million from the @entity9 central bank in 2003 , which he had begun to hide around the world			1
the assets would have been added to millions already deposited in accounts in other countries – mainly through @entity9 who had moved abroad			2
@entity2 is known to have concentrated large amounts in @entity12 and @entity30 , where he had at least two homes and moored a £ 17 million yacht			2
if @entity15 was party to this secret information – and indeed the location of the hidden millions – then he would have been an obvious target for an attack			0
@entity184 , the @entity29 prosecutor leading the inquiry into the quadruple killing , said he had ‘ not yet been informed ’ about the intelligence from @entity18			0
however he confirmed that mr @entity31 ’s financial affairs and his background in @entity9 were at the top of subjects being investigated			1
another theory previously mooted was that mr @entity31 was targeted by @entity194 spies desperate to get their hands on high - resolution satellite technology			1
the @entity197 was an expert in that field , and worked for @entity199 in @entity200			0
the family left their @entity203 campsite after two nights and moved to the @entity206 campsite , which overlooks @entity29 peaceful spot : walkers on the remote 3 km track to the scene of the attack outside the village of @entity213 where the @entity214 and @entity215 were murdered @entity216 , a @entity36 lawyer who defended @entity2 following his capture , admitted that the deposed regime still had funds in @entity12 accounts , but said the notion of a ‘ hidden fortune ’ was fantasy			1
@entity224 has been questioned by police , but is being treated solely as a witness after denying any involvement in the slaughter			0
when asked about the @entity67 story , @entity119 told @entity234 last night : ‘ it ’s all rubbish , they can speculate until they ’re blue in the face to be honest with you			0
’ further asked if his father had ever mentioned links to @entity2 , he said : ‘ we have no links with that regime			2
we live outside [ @entity9 ] because of that regime , that ’s why we have been here for 41 years			2
’ in a separate development , it emerged yesterday that mr @entity31 made a desperate attempt to drive his family to safety under a hail of bullets , but his car got stuck on a verge			1
the gunmen then moved in to finish them off at close range			0
investigators believe the killer was alone and used only one weapon , a pistol common in the @entity12 army in the @entity260 and @entity261			0
grief : family friends outside the @entity31 home in @entity118 , @entity32 , soon after the murders were reported concern : the @entity31 's home in @entity118 , @entity32			0
speculation still surrounds the motive for the shootings in which three members of the family died prayers : @entity15 , 50 , his wife @entity27 , 47 , and her 74 - year - old mother @entity275 , were laid to rest in the same grave in @entity32 @entity39 told police she and her father were outside the car when the shooting started			1
unable to get her into the car , he then attempted to escape in the vehicle with the rest of the family under fire			0
however , as he backed up to get away , the car became stuck on an embankment , leaving the family at the mercy of the killer who then shot the three adults , including mr @entity31 ’s mother - in - law @entity275 in the head			1
while it is unclear when cyclist @entity215 was killed , it appears his body was hit by the @entity98 ’ car during the attempted escape			0
after running out of ammunition , the killer pistol - whipped the older girl in the face , but was apparently interrupted and fled the scene			0
additional reporting : @entity304 and @entity305			0

@entity15 , 50 , killed *alongside* wife , mother - in - law and a @entity36 cyclist
