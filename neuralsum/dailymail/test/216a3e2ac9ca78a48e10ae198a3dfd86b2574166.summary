retired news legend @entity0 still has some clout - and a strong opinion about how @entity2 can turn things around at the ratings - challenged show she created , @entity4			1
@entity0 's magic bullet : @entity8			2
@entity0 says that the former @entity10 intern would be a ' run away success ' on @entity4 , a network source tells @entity13			1
she would attract great guests - even if casting her as a regular co-host would make it unlikely that potential 2016 presidential hopeful @entity16 or president @entity17 would ever appear on the show again			1
during the speech , the 41 - year - old former @entity10 intern talked about ' @entity32 ' and redefined her story as the first victim of cyber-bullying			1
' @entity0 believes that @entity8 , 41 , could make @entity4 competitive and compelling and while a lot of @entity41 's elite may scratch the show off its must - visit press list , the younger demographic of online users would tune in daily to see what she had to say , ' added the source			1
last year when discussing @entity8 with @entity47 , he asked her about @entity48 joining @entity4			1
it looked as though the late night host was reading her mind and she stuttered , ' i think it would be great if she were on @entity4			2
i would n't expect it tomorrow			0
' ' tomorrow is now , ' says the insider			0
the multi-host show was created by @entity0 in 1997 with an original panel of women including @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62			0
it defied the odds previous shows faced in the 11am time slot			0
@entity67 : she had enough of @entity4 and vice versa despite numerous cast changes – @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , and @entity75 have had stints as co-hosts on the show – @entity4 became a force to be reckoned with in daytime tv			2
but after the exit of @entity82 and @entity72 and the addition of @entity75 , @entity4 took a ratings dive			2
@entity2 decided to overhaul the show following the end of that season , and replaced @entity88 and @entity75 with @entity90 analyst @entity89 and actress @entity91			0
the network also brought back @entity73 to join the show 's long - running moderator , @entity93			2
in - fighting between @entity93 and @entity73 and endless backstage turmoil caused @entity2 to move the show from its entertainment division to its news division			0
despite numerous set changes and multiple updates to the show opening , the new ensemble never seemed to attract viewers and ratings continued to fall			0
@entity2 then had a failed attempt at firing @entity106 while she was rehearing for her @entity109 show @entity108 in january			0
in february , after the return of @entity93 who had been sidelined with a back injury , @entity2 let @entity73 go but allowed her to use her recent divorce as her excuse for departing the show for a second time			2
( she had a failed one - year stint as moderator in 2007 that abruptly ended after she walked off set following an on - air blow - up with co-host @entity72			0
) down to three co-hosts and two chairs vacant , @entity2 has been closely looking at @entity124 member @entity123 , fashion host @entity125 , former child star @entity126 and comedienne @entity127 as potential replacements			0
president @entity17 appeared on @entity4 in 2011 talking about his book @entity130 to work and the current economic troubles occurring in @entity132			1
it is doubtful he would be a guest if @entity8 was co-host @entity4 celebratesd 4000 shows with guest co-hosts @entity0 and @entity61 the network is also seriously considering convincing former co-host @entity82 to return as a full - time panelist			1
she has made a half - dozen co-host appearances since january and was on - hand for the show 's 4,000 - episode celebration show			2
@entity0 , who sold all rights to @entity4 back to @entity2 a year before her retirement in may 2014 , has been contacting @entity144 , president of @entity146 , and @entity147 , president , @entity148 , trying to convince them to hire @entity8 , insiders tell @entity13			1
@entity0 believes that @entity8 could reignite interest in the show and after a decade - long silence ; she has a lot to say			1
' @entity0 has been like a godmother to @entity48 ever since their infamous interview in 1999 following the @entity17 scandal			0
she 's always believed @entity8 got the short end of the stick in the court of public opinion and has tirelessly defended her on the show over the years , ' a source close to the show says			0
@entity0 told @entity47 , ' i like @entity8			0
she never had a chance to move on , ' the way @entity17 and @entity16 did			1
' she 's an intelligent , nice woman			0
' @entity8 recently participated in a 22 - minute long @entity28 that has made international headlines			1
during the speech , the 41 - year - old former @entity10 intern spoke about ' @entity32 ' and redefined her story as the first victim of cyber-bullying			1
@entity0 , arrives for the @entity173 fashion show last february			0
she remains spry and opinionated too			0
she 's convinced @entity8 would help save the show not only that , but since re-emerging out of the shadows to address her affair with @entity17 in a compelling @entity178 essay last may , she has taken on an extremely attractive new look to match her new persona			1
according to a representative of the show , @entity8 has been asked to come on the show as a guest to discuss her anti-bullying campaign but is not on the list of potential co-hosts at this time			2
while current co-host @entity189 would love to have @entity8 as a regular on the show , staunch @entity193 supporters and @entity17 friends @entity93 and @entity106 are n't feeling the idea at all , the source revealed			1
a few weeks ago the talk managed to edge out the view in the @entity198 , but @entity4 has come back to beat out the relative newcomer ever since			1
' whatever @entity146 plans to do to salvage the show , they better do it fast , ' the source concluded !			0

the grand dame of *broadcasters* believes that @entity8 has the right stuff to bring @entity4 back from the brink
the former @entity10 intern would also draw great guests - although probably not @entity16 or @entity17
her recent @entity28 on ' @entity32 ' redefines her story as the first victim of cyber-bullying
in recent weeks *nielsen* ratings showed that the talk beat out @entity4 for the first time but @entity4 made a comeback
