by @entity0 published : 23:39 est , 3 february 2013 updated : 05:02 est , 4 february 2013 the problem of horsemeat contamination may have spread from beef burgers to budget pies , pasties and ready meals			1
the @entity7 ( @entity7 ) is under pressure to begin testing a much wider range of beef products following revelations that contamination goes far wider than originally believed			1
it emerged over the weekend that pies and pasties supplied to @entity15 prisons as halal beef actually contained pork , which is contrary to @entity20 religious laws			1
there are now fears that pasties and pies could have been contaminated with horse meat ( file picture ) if pork is appearing in certified halal pies , mps are concerned that horse and other species have also been used in many more budget beef products			1
the manufacturer of the pies , distributed by wholesaler 3663 , was named yesterday as @entity35 , which is based in @entity36			0
food manufacturers and supermarkets have been called to emergency talks with the @entity7 today to understand the extent of the food fraud			0
the @entity7 has been put in charge of handling @entity15 ’s investigation into the contamination of beef products with horsemeat and pork			1
however , critics have serious doubts about the organisation ’s handling of the crisis amid concerns it is too close to the food industry			0
in one glaring omission , @entity7 chiefs have failed to test the products that have been removed from sale by the likes of @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , the co-op , @entity65 ’s and others			2
it is only testing products that went into production after the contamination emerged two weeks ago , which is after any suspect ingredients had been taken out			1
the @entity7 said the decision to limit testing was made on the basis that the presence of other types of meat is not a food safety issue			0
@entity7 chiefs have failed to test the products that have been removed from sale by the likes of @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , the co-op , @entity65 's and others however , this approach means the watchdog is failing in its duty to enforce labelling laws , which state that it is a criminal offence to mislead the public by describing a product as beef when it also contains horse or pork			1
the @entity7 ’s handling of the scandal was been surrounded by secrecy , which included refusing to identify the firm responsible for the tainted halal pies			1
subsequently , the food wholesale company , 3663 , which distributed the pies to some prisons , named the manufacturer as @entity35			0
it said the products have been withdrawn			0
@entity102 said it viewed the contamination with ‘ deep regret ’ and insisted that pork is not included in the recipes of any of its halal products			2
@entity110 mp , a member of the @entity114 food and farming select committee , which oversees the @entity7 , said widespread testing of pies , pasties and other beef products is needed urgently			1
‘ how are we to know whether or not there is horsemeat in pies and other products unless there is some testing ? ’ he said supermarket shelves were cleared of meat products in the wake of the horse meat scandal ‘ the @entity7 must be much more proactive in this area			1
we are in a recession and it is precisely the time that people do take these sorts of short cuts			0
’ mr @entity110 said the limited testing ordered by the @entity7 so far , which has left out the products removed from sale , was ‘ perverse ’			2
he said : ‘ if they have taken a clear decision that products are being taken off sale by the supplier and therefore we are not going to test them , that would be absolutely wrong			0
’ @entity148 ( correct ) @entity147 , professor of @entity149 at the @entity150 , said the government and the @entity7 have been involved in buck - passing over responsibility for dealing with the scandal			0
he said the @entity7 ’s narrow testing means it may have missed the chance to identify the true scale of the problem			2
the @entity7 described the presence of pork in halal pies as ‘ unacceptable ’			2
however , it said no decision has been made to extend testing beyond burgers and other products containing raw mince beef			0
‘ we have called an urgent meeting of major retailers and suppliers on monday to ensure that everyone is fully aware of their responsibilities , ’ it said .			0
