by @entity0 miraculous : @entity2 , pictured with her newborn son @entity3 , gave birth while still paralysed a woman who had a stroke days before she was due to have a baby gave birth to her son while still paralysed			1
nurse @entity2 was out shopping when she realised she was having a stroke			2
she managed to tell her husband : ‘ we need to go to hospital			0
it ’s not the baby , i ’m really ill ’ – moments before losing her ability to speak and move			0
doctors managed to stabilise her , but the family was faced with an agonising choice of whether to undergo a life - saving procedure which posed risks for both mother and baby			2
the procedure , called thrombolysis , involves the administration of a clot - busting drug			0
it had never been performed on a pregnant woman at the hospital – and there was a risk of mrs @entity2 and her baby suffering a brain haemorrhage			1
however , the family decided to go ahead			0
mrs @entity2 recovered her speech within four hours but remained almost totally paralysed down her left side			1
then just three days later with the help of an epidural , her son @entity3 was born weighing 6lb 11oz			1
such was the scale of mrs @entity2 ’s stroke , in september last year , that she had to learn to walk again			1
@entity3 was allowed to go home at a week old and his mother joined him at the family home in @entity48 , @entity49 , a week later where she began the long road to recovery			2
now just ten months on , mrs @entity2 and her mechanic husband , @entity52 , 36 , are delighted with the extent of her recovery			1
mrs @entity2 , a haematology nurse at the @entity55 where she gave birth , said : ‘ i ca n’t describe it how scary having a stroke and knowing that i was about to give birth was – i did n’t think i was going to make it			1
healthy : mrs @entity2 recovered fully from her stroke - which left her unable to walk or speak - and her son is developing normally ‘ i was very lucky knowing exactly what was happening to me so we could act quickly			1
‘ but having so much knowledge made it so much worse because i knew what might happen			0
’ the drama began when 29 - year - old mrs @entity2 thought she had cramps while out shopping			1
she sat down to rest but , unable to push herself up with her left arm , realised she was having a stroke			2
filled with dread for her unborn baby , she managed to alert her husband before becoming paralysed			0
mrs @entity2 believes if she had not been with her husband she might not have reached hospital in time			2
she said : ‘ i knew straight away what was going on in my body			0
‘ if i ’d been at home on my own i just do n’t know what would have happened			0
@entity3 ’s a little miracle and he ’s developing absolutely fine			0
’ healthy : @entity3 , pictured left with his father @entity52 , and right with mrs @entity2 , developed like any other healthy baby treatment : mrs @entity2 had to stay in hospital for a week longer than her son , and needed lengthy physiotherapy in order to walk again she added : ‘ i ’m a nurse and it still shocks me that someone so young could have a stroke			1
there was a risk to him when i was thrombolysed but who knows what would have happened if i had n’t been ? ’ although her speech had returned , she remained partially paralysed and has been undergoing therapy to regain her movement			0
she undertook pioneering electrical impulse treatment at @entity105 in @entity106 to help her walk again			0
the treatment , targeting the nerves , has been shown to help stroke victims who suffer from movement difficulties			0
mrs @entity2 , who has now improved to the point where she has been able to return to work , said : ‘ now every milestone for @entity3 is a milestone for me and an extra feeling of relief we can get back to normal			1

@entity2 , 29 , left unable to speak or walk while *39* weeks pregnant
*surgeons* agonised over whether to treat stroke - and risk *harming* baby
but mrs @entity2 was treated and gave birth *naturally* to son @entity3
she faced a difficult recovery , but she and @entity3 are now completely healthy
