by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 9 march 2013 updated : 14:23 est , 11 march 2013 shipshape : @entity0 pictured at @entity1 in the 1970s , when she was still 16 - year - old @entity0 i was barely 12 when my daydreams began to sharpen into a single focused ambition – and i certainly would n’t need to know quadratic equations to achieve it			1
it was the end of the @entity8 and everywhere you looked you saw a model called @entity11			1
from the moment i saw that girl with @entity15 eyes in @entity16 , i knew i wanted to be her			2
hey , @entity0 , i thought , you could do this , too ! when my class was asked to write an essay on ‘ @entity20 ’ , i wrote about how i was going to be a top model and live in @entity22			1
there was only one small thing standing between me and model superstardom : i ’d been an angelic - looking little girl , but almost overnight i ’d become a big - toothed , geeky - haired , skinny - legged kid			1
the next day in class i found a group of girls reading my essay aloud in fits of laughter			2
i was determined to prove them wrong , and the idea of becoming a model occupied my every waking hour			1
it was n’t the money or fame that appealed : i just wanted to wear fabulous clothes and be in beautiful pictures			2
so , in the summer of my 14th year , my parents sent me to the @entity43 on @entity44			2
the tutors were former models who taught us etiquette , make - up skills and how to walk with stacks of books on our heads			1
in those days it was all about deportment and nothing like the slouchy strut of today ’s models			1
my blossoming looks and confidence fortunately coincided with the realisation that boys were rather interesting			2
as well as the school builders , my friend @entity61 and i had an ongoing flirtation with a cute lad called @entity65			2
that ended abruptly after he showed us his willy			2
i was totally cool because i had two brothers , but for the rest of the day i ’d catch @entity61 shuddering : ‘ oh , it was horrible			0
’ then there was the vicar ’s son , @entity73			0
the vicarage overlooked our house and whenever he saw me come into my bedroom he ’d hold up a sign saying , ‘ @entity79			0
’ i would smile and wave , just to be polite , but then one day i saw him at the window with a telescope trained on my room			0
i was 15 when , with trembling hands , i flicked through the @entity85 and found what i was looking for : a photo of a young girl wearing a simple white dress and holding a daisy , her blonde hair falling about her shoulders , captioned : ‘ @entity0 , from @entity93 in @entity94 ’			1
my dream had come true			0
my big break had come courtesy of an amateur photographer called @entity100 , who had heard about my modelling ambition			0
not long after , a letter arrived addressed to ‘ @entity0 , @entity93 , @entity94 ’			1
@entity103 was instantly suspicious and whipped it away , but @entity105 told me later it was from a bloke saying he wanted to take me into the hop fields and ‘ show you what real life is about ’			1
as you can imagine , @entity103 freaked			0
so i changed my name to @entity0 , after @entity103 ’s middle name			1
he was a bit happier then			0
i was next whisked off to a posh dentist to fix the gap between my two front teeth ( a gap that , ironically , is the height of fashion these days ) and i was soon armed with my new model card , featuring @entity122 ’s shots and the following blurb : ‘ @entity124 ’ 6 , bust 33 , waist 23 , hips 35 , inside leg 31 , outside 40			1
’ @entity130 dreams : @entity0 with siblings @entity132 , @entity133 and @entity134 aged 14 , at the height of her @entity11 obsession , and determined to become a model i started working for all the teen magazines , especially @entity139 , for the fun , playful shoots : roller - skating , jumping off walls – that sort of thing			1
i did a job with three other models for a @entity149 magazine in which we had to have a food fight			0
at the studio there was a table covered with cream cakes , buns and jellies			0
the other girls were a bit timid , but i really got stuck in			0
my life became a dizzying succession of pinch - me moments			1
i was sent to @entity163 for the pret - a - porter shows and remember setting off with dreams of the @entity167 catwalk , but the reality turned out to be altogether less glamorous			1
i stayed in a grotty little flat that reeked of drains and did n’t get a single job			0
things looked up when one of the other models promised me a fabulous night out , but when i arrived at the restaurant , i found her sitting with two much older men , all sweaty palms and leering eyes			0
even at 16 , it did n’t take me long to work out that i ’d been invited as dessert			1
after one clammy grope too many , i made my excuses and fled			0
but things soon picked up professionally : it was as if someone had stamped on the accelerator			0
i embarked on some crazy years as a single girl about town , meeting pretty much everyone in @entity189 including , of course , my future husband @entity188			1
it was the start of an extra-ordinary 30 - year adventure			1
last days : @entity0 and @entity188 at daughter @entity193 's wedding in 2008 shortly before they split after @entity188 left in 2008 , i could n’t face leaving the house			1
i would wander from room to room , looking at all the mementoes of our life together			2
for most of my adult life i had been defined by my relationship with @entity188 and @entity204			1
i had been part of them and protected by them			0
now , not only was i losing my husband , i was losing my identity			0
it is only with hindsight , that i realise there was nothing to be afraid of outside the golden prison			0
i am now in control of my life			2
i get respect for my own achievements			0
i ’m not going to lie – i do miss being absolutely spoilt			0
that is wonderful ! but if you ’re constantly treated like a cossetted child , you can sometimes start to behave like one			0
in that respect , stepping outside @entity204 was a huge growing - up process for me – and i have now grown into the person i was meant to be all along			2
and while i might not fly first - class every time , i ’ll take freedom and independence over a bit of extra leg - room any day			2
