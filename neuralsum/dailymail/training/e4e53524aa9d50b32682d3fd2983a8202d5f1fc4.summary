by @entity0 @entity1 may have sealed @entity4 's @entity3 fate by failing to beat @entity5 on thursday , but we ca n't say that @entity7 were n't chasing the game after they were caught offside an incredible 11 times			1
the last time that many offsides was recorded in a @entity3 game was at the 2006 tournament and came from @entity1 again ... twice ! the @entity1 managed to rack up 11 offsides against @entity15 in the group stages and @entity17 in the semi-finals before eventually winning the tournament			1
there have been 12 occasions of a side getting more than 11 offsides in a @entity3 game since 1966 , with @entity25 € ™ s 20 against @entity26 in 1982 the most			2
not again ! @entity1 were caught offside 11 times in their 1 - 0 defeat to @entity5 at the @entity3 the @entity31 ' 82 tournament will be best remembered by @entity4 supporters for @entity34 's goal against @entity35 after 27 seconds - the fourth fastest in @entity3 history			1
however , it was the group game against @entity26 that brought @entity4 their unwanted record			0
@entity40 scored the only goal in the 1 - 0 victory at the @entity43 in @entity44 , but it is the twenty offside calls that has remained a talking point - that 's approximately one every five minutes			0
serial offenders ! @entity1 twice racked up 11 offsides in a game on their way to winning the 2006 @entity3 @entity4 had already secured qualification as group winners while @entity26 had come into the game after one of the most controversial events in @entity3 history when they stopped playing to concede a goal against @entity35 after hearing what they thought was the referee 's whistle			1
@entity62 , brother of the @entity63 and president of the @entity65 , rushed onto the pitch and remonstrated until the @entity68 referee disallowed the goal - only for the @entity70 to score minutes later and win the game 4 - 1			0
record breakers ! @entity4 's @entity73 played against @entity26 in a @entity3 game that featured 20 offsides deadlock broken : @entity40 scored the only goal of the game , but was guilty of missing more chances @entity26 became the first @entity80 team to ever face @entity4 and put in a decent performance albeit against opposition who had nothing to play for			1
@entity4 were generally in control throughout the game but were guilty of a succession of missed opportunities before @entity40 and @entity73 combined to break the deadlock			0
the same two players had the best chances thereafter but looked more interested in conserving energy for the more challenging tests ahead			0
having topped the group with victories over @entity35 , @entity96 and @entity26 , @entity4 eventually bowed out in the next round after goalless draws with @entity17 and @entity31 - where @entity99 largely blamed for missing several chances , despite nursing niggling injuries			2
@entity4 @entity26 @entity102 [ @entity103 ] @entity105 @entity104 [ @entity106 ] @entity107 [ @entity108 ] @entity109 [ @entity110 ] @entity111 @entity73 [ @entity112 ] said @entity113 [ @entity112 ] @entity114 [ @entity115 ] @entity116 [ @entity117 ] @entity118 [ @entity115 ] @entity119 [ @entity103 ] @entity120 [ @entity121 ] @entity122			0
