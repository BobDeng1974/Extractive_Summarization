it is a dishonor to our feminist history to symbolically idolize @entity4 by allowing him to perform his misogynist music at our university , ’ the petition adds			2
‘ we see this as a blatant form of reinforcing rape culture and sexism , ’ @entity51 , the organization ’s president , told @entity53			1

she wrote : ' the subject [ of the song ] itself is enough to make some female music fans uncomfortable			0
the song is about how a girl wants crazy wild sex but does n’t say it - positing that age - old problem where men think no means yes into a catchy , hummable song			0
' @entity136 of @entity137 in @entity138 first slammed the song in april and wrote : ' has anyone heard @entity4 's new rape song ? basically , the majority of the song … has the @entity143 singer murmuring ‘ i know you want it ’ over and over into a girl ’s ear			1
sexist : the video caused a stir because while @entity4 and his fellow male performers , @entity68 and @entity69 , are dressed , the woman wear very little in the nude : the women wear just thongs in the video , while the men remain fully clothed ' call me a cynic , but that phrase does not exactly encompass the notion of consent in sexual activity			1
' and @entity4 's comments about the video did n't exactly help him to win back female fans			1
in an interview with may 's @entity168 he said : ' we tried to do everything that was taboo - bestiality , drug injections , and everything that is completely derogatory towards women			0
' ' what a pleasure it is to degrade a woman , ' he continued			0
' i ’ve never gotten to do that before			0
i ’ve always respected women			0
' the 36 - year - old singer - who is happily married to actress @entity182 - tried to defend the song on the basis that both @entity68 and @entity69 are ' happily married with children ' and that because they are settled in their personal lives they were both ' the perfect guys to make this			0
' @entity4 previously said that director @entity188 came up with the idea of using nude models			2
' as long as it 's fun and the girls are comfortable let 's do something silly , ' @entity4 said			0
' let 's take some chances			0
' @entity197 : @entity4 has admitted that the inspiration for the single was being ' derogatory to women ' blatant misogyny : the video in large part is made up of the men ogling the scantily clad women while pulling or brushing their hair and whispering ' i know you want it ' into their ears			1
