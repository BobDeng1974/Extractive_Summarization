in june , @entity7 's unforgiving widow , said she refused to accept that @entity36 be used as an excuse by her husband 's killer			1
talking about @entity2 , @entity40 said that she had no intention of ever absolving him			1
@entity40 , 38 , told @entity42 that @entity36 is a condition that does influence a sufferers mood , but ' you 're not going to blame someone else , in my opinion when you murder two people in cold blood			2
' @entity7 was the author of the bestselling book , ' @entity7 ' and was writing a new book , ' @entity52 : a history of the @entity18 in @entity54 ' at the time of his death			1
the book is on general release now			0
the sniper was so feared by insurgents in @entity61 , that an $ 80,000 bounty was placed on his head and he was known by his nickname of ' @entity65 ' - ' @entity7 '			1
@entity2 , 25 , has claimed he was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and that @entity7 was helping him through his condition			1
however , @entity40 ' scorn for @entity2 's claims are evident through the manner in which she speaks of those who live with @entity36			1
former @entity8 seal and author of bestselling book @entity7 , @entity7 ( pictured ) was fatally shot along with another man on a gun range in february , 2013 pain : @entity40 spoke at length about the loss of @entity7 her husband - and brushed off any suggestion that @entity36 could be a legitimate reason for her husband 's murder by @entity83 ' they ( those with @entity36 ) worked through their struggles , just like we work through our struggles			1
they are phenomenal people and it does n’t change their character , ' said @entity40 to @entity42			0
' might change their mood once in a while , might have sleepless nights , does n’t make them a murderer			0
' opening up about how she has learned to cope without her decorated husband , @entity40 became emotional remembering him			0
he was patient , supportive , funny , loving			0
i miss his hands , hugs			0
i miss him laughing with the kids every day			0
i do n’t think there ’s much that i do n’t miss about him			0
' during the interview she explained that she still lives with their two children at their @entity114 family home and still keeps the house the same as when @entity7 was still there			1
and tragically she revealed how just as @entity7 had accepted and become comfortable with his decision to leave the @entity8 , be a full time dad and work on his books , she became aware of a sixth - sense that things might not stay this way			1
having spent years worrying daily about losing her husband in battle , now she had him home , she became gripped by a ' be careful what you wish for ' moment			0
in an interview earlier this month , @entity40 said she does not believe that @entity2 was a @entity36 sufferer			1
' people who have ptsd do n’t talk about it			0
they do n’t use it as an excuse			0
they carry guns and they do good work and love their families , ' she said to the @entity139			0
' they struggle , but it does n’t change their character			0
' making the shot : @entity7 takes aim from on top of an overturned crib during the @entity147 four tours : during his time in @entity61 , he gained infamy among the insurgents , who nicknamed him ' the @entity152 ' and put a $ 20,000 price on his head @entity40 is hoping that @entity2 's trial will shed more light on his alleged motives			1
' @entity7 has a lot of experience with guys with @entity36 — hunting , shooting and healing , ' said @entity40			2
' for that reason alone , there was no reason not to take him to the range — there ’s a lot more information @entity7 would have needed to not to make that decision			2
' @entity7 , was a cowboy from @entity171 , @entity6 who grew up hunting deer and pheasant with a rifle and a shotgun his dad bought him			2
he never realized he was a good shot until he joined the @entity8 and got into the prestigious @entity8 special operations unit			0
' i thought to myself , ' oh , hell yeah ! ' it was an honor , ' he told @entity181 when army intelligence told him about his infamy			0
@entity40 stands during the playing of @entity185 during a memorial service for former her husband and @entity8 sniper @entity7 at @entity189 in @entity190 , @entity6 , february 11 , 2013 long shot : mr @entity7 poses here with the rifle , a @entity193 , he used to kill an insurgent from 2,100 yards away outside @entity195 but his @entity8 companions gave him a different name ' the legend			2
' his most legendary shot came outside @entity195 in 2008 when he spotted an insurgent with a rocket launcher near an @entity203 convoy -- 2,100 yards away			0
at that distance , 1.2 miles , he fired a shot from his .338 @entity193 rifle			0
it struck home , knocking the man over dead			0
' @entity211 blew that bullet and hit him , ' mr @entity7 told the @entity139			2
mr @entity7 's preferred weapon , though , was a custom - built bolt action rifle with a powerful scope			2
it was chambered in .300 @entity217 , a cartridge originally developed for hunting @entity30 big game			0
however , mr @entity7 said he has found a new use for it -- making long range , highly accurate shots			2
' i could hit a target from 1,800 yards , and it would shoot like a laser , ' he told @entity181 .			0
