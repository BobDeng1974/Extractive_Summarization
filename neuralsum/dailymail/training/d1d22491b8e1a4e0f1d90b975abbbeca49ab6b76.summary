by @entity0 published : 18:02 est , 30 september 2012 updated : 05:34 est , 1 october 2012 @entity1 will vow today to spend billions of pounds of taxpayers ’ money on building affordable homes and a stamp duty holiday if @entity6 is elected – after insisting the party has nothing to apologise for on the economy			1
the shadow chancellor will tell his party ’s annual conference in @entity13 that he would use the proceeds of the forthcoming sale of the @entity17 mobile phone spectrum to fund the initiatives			1
the defiant announcement is a deliberate contrast to the approach of @entity22 , who used all the £ 22.5billion raised from the sale of the 3g spectrum to pay down the deficit , even in the boom year of 2000			2
he would use the proceeds of the sale of the @entity17 mobile spectrum to finance fiscal measures although @entity49 is now battling to avoid a full - scale debt crisis , mr @entity1 will say he would use the £ 3billion expected to be raised from the latest sale to build 100,000 affordable homes and fund a two - year stamp duty holiday for first - time buyers of properties worth up to £ 250,000			2
the shadow chancellor , asked yesterday whether he would apologise for @entity6 ’s ‘ profligacy ’ when in power , declared : ‘ no. ’ mr @entity1 said @entity6 had never pretended to be a ‘ balanced budget party ’ , telling the @entity61 website : ‘ we were a borrow - to - invest and balance the current budget party			1
‘ @entity63 and @entity64 would like nothing better than for me to say that the reason there was a global financial crisis , the reason that our deficit went up , is because of @entity6 public spending			1
’ last minute revisions ? some @entity74 hope that mr @entity42 would replace mr @entity1 in the economic role should the party form a government after the next general election mr @entity1 insisted @entity49 ’s structural deficit was only ‘ marginally higher ’ than other countries before the financial crisis hit , a claim derided by the conservatives , who accuse @entity6 of ‘ failing to fix the roof while the sun was shining ’			1
labour leader @entity42 refused to guarantee that mr @entity1 would be his chancellor if @entity6 wins the election , though he appears powerless to move him			1
some @entity74 hope for a comeback by former chancellor @entity89 , or even mr @entity42 ’s vanquished brother @entity90 , to take mr @entity1 ’s place towards the next election			1
amid persistent reports of tensions between him and mr @entity95 , when the leader was asked if mr @entity1 would definitely be chancellor if there was a @entity6 government , he replied : ‘ i think i ’ll make my cabinet when it comes to			1
measuring the curtains is not my style			2
’ mr @entity1 , however , made it clear that he did not expect to be shifted to another shadow cabinet post			1
he said he would do everything he could to ‘ make it work ’ if @entity107 decided he wanted to come back to the political front line			1
but asked if he would relinquish the shadow chancellorship , he replied : ‘ there ’s a limit even to my generosity			1
’ in his conference speech today , mr @entity1 will say building 100,000 more affordable homes would help kick - start the economy and create hundreds of thousands of jobs			2
‘ we ’re just one of two @entity120 countries in recession , the longest double - dip recession since the @entity123			2
and because we are in recession , the deficit is now not going down , it ’s going up – by 22 per cent so far this year , ’ he will say			2
‘ there is nothing credible about a plan that leads to a double - dip recession , thousands of businesses bust , a million young people out of work , billions wasted on a soaring benefits bill , and borrowing going up not down			0
' rising borrowing , not to invest in the jobs of the future , but to pay for the mounting costs of this government ’s economic failure			0
’ a @entity142 source said the government had not made any decision on what to do with the proceeds of the @entity17 sale			0
‘ @entity1 is all over the place – a feeble attempt to regain lost economic credibility with vague promises of a spending review after the election , then an unfunded stamp - duty cut , and now more spending , ’ the source added			0
‘ it is total incoherence			0
’ @entity42 : he insisted he would undergo no @entity159 - style makeover to make him more attractive to voters before an election @entity6 's attempts to overhaul @entity42 ’s image by portraying him as a man of the people were undermined yesterday as he insisted he was proud to be seen as a ' pointy - headed ’ policy wonk			1
the party launched a tv film relentlessly highlighting mr @entity42 ’s comprehensive school background in an apparent attempt to contrast his upbringing with that of @entity173			2
old schoolfriends and teachers went before the cameras to suggest mr @entity42 ’s ordinary education helped him to understand the lives of voters			0
polls suggest mr @entity42 ’s personal ratings are well behind those of @entity63 , with voters struggling to see him as a credible prime minister			0
the main aim for this year ’s @entity6 conference in @entity13 appears to be to bring across his personality to voters and give more of a sense of what makes him tick			1
mr @entity42 , however , flatly rejected suggestions that he should undergo a makeover like @entity159 , who was coached to lower her voice and had her hair restyled before winning in 1979			0
' i ’m certainly not going to be doing that , ’ the @entity6 leader declared			1
asked if he minded being seen as ' pointy - headed , ’ mr @entity42 said : ' i think it ’s rather a compliment			0
' i ’m my own person and i ’m going to do it my own way			0
i think ideas matter in politics and i ’m not embarrassed about that , right ? ’ mr @entity42 dismissed a poll commissioned by the conservatives suggesting that two - thirds of @entity6 supporters think his brother @entity90 would be a better leader for the party			1
' it ’s quite a compliment the @entity211 produced a poll about me , ’ he said			0
' it shows i ’ve got them worried			0
’ pressed on whether his brother would return to @entity6 ’s top team , mr @entity42 said : ' he made a decision not to join the shadow cabinet and that continues to be his view , that he wants to be in the front line but not on the front bench			1
’ according to an updated biography of mr @entity42 , towards the end of last year @entity90 was overheard saying : ' @entity1 will crash and burn			0
’ the former foreign secretary was in @entity13 yesterday for the start of the conference , but will leave before his brother ’s keynote speech tomorrow			0
asked yesterday if he had seen the poll suggesting he would be a more popular leader , @entity90 replied : ' yes , but the most important thing to remember is that the grass always seems greener on the other side of the fence			0
' i ’m determined to do everything i can by supporting him ( @entity237 )			0
sometimes that means speaking out , but it also means having the modesty sometimes to keep out of the way			0
’ shadow business secretary @entity242 , increasingly touted as a future leadership contender , admitted yesterday that @entity6 was not good enough at explaining its policies in ways that voters feel is relevant			1
' we have n’t connected enough with people ’s lives , ’ he said			0
' one of the problems sometimes is talking in jargon and percentages			0
you ’ve got to relate what we say to people ’s lives and make it relevant			2
’ @entity6 ’s deputy leader @entity259 admitted many voters do not even know yet who mr @entity42 is			1
she told the @entity264 ’s @entity263 programme : ' we need to set forth our plans , because people want to know that @entity42 has a strong set of plans so that the politics of a government can make a difference to their life , and he ’s very determined he will do that			2
