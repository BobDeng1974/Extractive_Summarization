this week , @entity150 caused a @entity192 stir by posting a picture of himself on the telephone to @entity185 president @entity184			0
@entity196 actor @entity195 was one of the first to mock the rather embarrassing image - posting an image of himself with a packet of @entity200 to his ear along with the caption - ' i 'm now patched in as well - sorry for the delay			0
' ' you have got a @entity160 which is no longer standing up for business - quite a big development , that			0
i think , personally they do so at their peril			0
the @entity212 absolutely slammed the irresponsible speech made by a conservative minister this last week on immigration			0
' and yet the @entity96 who wo n't stand up against xenophobia			0
instead of trying to actually reduce the temperature of the debate they try and stoke it			0
' mr @entity0 , whose hopes of remaining in power after 2015 depend on another coalition , attacked both @entity96 and the @entity46 over reports suggesting they could rule out any power - sharing deal in the event of a hung parliament			1
reports suggest that @entity150 is privately considering ruling out a coalition and promising to rule at the head of a minority administration if the @entity160 fail to secure an overall majority , and unite general secretary @entity233 has also reportedly suggested that @entity96 should go it alone even if they fail to win the most seats			2
@entity150 , @entity186 and @entity184 pose for a selfie at @entity190 's memorial service @entity150 's now infamous self portrait of his telephone conversation with @entity184 mr @entity0 said there was an assumption within @entity96 that ' government will drop into their lap ' and they did not need to work for it			2
' i have found it very striking to see this @entity248 tendency in both the @entity96 and @entity160 who are now going one step further and saying ' even if we do n't have a majority , we will govern @entity163 ' , which overlooks the slightly old - fashioned democratic principle that you have to win a majority before you have a right to say you will govern @entity163			0
' all of this just reveals a really unpleasant mix of arrogance and cowardice on the part of the two main parties , the two larger parties in @entity163 politics			0

@entity0 challenged about not campaigning for a majority in 2015
he insisted best way of having @entity7 policies in power was in coalition
