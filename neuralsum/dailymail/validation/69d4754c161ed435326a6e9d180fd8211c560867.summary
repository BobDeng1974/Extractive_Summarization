in 1988 , when @entity1 was getting in his stride as @entity4 manager , he revealed in an interview with a local newspaper that he did a master 's degree in economics because it gave him a ' way to understand what was going on around me '			1
the 65 - year - old must now wrap his head around how @entity15 were eliminated from the @entity16 in the last 16 for the fifth year running , despite a 2 - 0 win against his former club that left it 3 - 3 on aggregate			1
@entity1 's return to @entity4 was not as romantic as he would have liked as no banners were unfurled at the @entity23 and few pleasantries were exchanged during a match that saw @entity15 win the battle , but lose the war			1
@entity15 manager @entity1 's return to his former club @entity4 ended in a 2 - 0 win that saw his team go out 3 - 3 on aggregate @entity1 cut a frustrated figure even though his team won 2 - 0 against @entity4 as they were dumped out of the @entity16 @entity1 holds his head in his hands ( left ) and gestures ( right ) as @entity15 failed to overturn the 3 - 1 deficit from the first leg @entity1 leaves the pitch following their exit from the @entity16 at the last 16 stage for the fifth year running @entity1 will analyse his team 's performance in the @entity16 this season after being dumped out in the last 16 again @entity1 leaves the pitch as @entity15 were dumped out of the @entity16 last 16 by his former club @entity4 read chief sports writer @entity45 's match report from the @entity23 @entity15 's exit on away goals means @entity1 must now focus on qualifying for next year 's competition and little can be made in mitigation for being denied a place in the quarter - finals by a team sitting fourth in @entity54			1
' we have gone out in the last 16 in the last four years , but twice against the future winners , ' @entity1 said ahead of the match , though it would take some doing for @entity59 's @entity4 to become the third eventual @entity61 champions to boot @entity15 out			1
@entity1 is sure to analyse his team 's exit and it was in that same interview with @entity4 - @entity66 some 27 years ago that he revealed his habit for making sure he watches at least half an hour of football every evening , among other interests			1
' i read a lot , all sorts of books because you have to be conversant in a larger and larger amount of things , ' the then - @entity4 manager said in 1988			2
' for example , i follow closely what is being released in the book store , be it in @entity82 , in @entity83 or in @entity84			2
i take notes by hand			0
i do not know how to type			0
i have watched a lot of matches			0
' this is part of continuing to grow [ as a manager ]			2
you take a step back from your football and you analyse the practices elsewhere			0
' i have at least 250 [ video cassettes ]			0
every evening , at home , i watch a game for about half an hour			0
often , it is the opponent that we are about to play , sometimes , it is just for enjoyment			0
@entity103 [ @entity104 ] vs @entity105 [ @entity106 ] for example			0
' watching this match will not make for pleasant viewing for @entity1 , however , as his first competitive return to a city famous for its casino and where one in three people are millionaires saw @entity15 leave empty - handed			2
@entity1 got off to a flyer as @entity4 manager , winning the @entity54 title in 1988 to put the lid on a fine first season @entity1 worked with some huge names in @entity4 and is pictured giving instructions to @entity123 who played there from 1992 - 94 @entity84 pair @entity126 ( left ) and @entity127 arrived at @entity4 in 1987 @entity1 was in charge when @entity130 playmaker @entity129 joined @entity131 from @entity133 outfit @entity132 - he won the title in 1997 after @entity1 left @entity1 was hoisted high after guiding @entity4 to the @entity135 in 1991 - they beat @entity137 1 - 0 at the @entity138 in @entity139 @entity1 puts his players through their paces - making full use of the security barriers in the @entity23 in 1992 this one goes back a bit - it 's @entity1 playing @entity131 for @entity146 during a league game in 1978 midfielder @entity148 hugs @entity1 after @entity4 made the final of the 1992 @entity150 by beating @entity151 on away goals @entity1 kitted out for sessions in charge of his @entity4 players - that adidas gear ( right ) goes down a storm now with lovers of all things retro it would be fair to say @entity1 had some hair - raising moments during his time at @entity4 - if this picture from 1987 is anything to go by wenger with @entity166 - the @entity168 legend was manager of @entity169 when the current @entity171 boss was in charge of @entity4 @entity1 's assistant @entity173 was well named when sitting next to his boss in the @entity4 dugout			1
purple shell suits ? definitely 1989 this was @entity1 during his first match in @entity61 competition as @entity4 manager - a victory over @entity182 in 1988			1

@entity1 's @entity15 won 2 - 0 against @entity4 in the second leg of their @entity16 **tie**
it was not enough as @entity15 lost on away goals as the last 16 **tie** ended 3 - 3 on aggregate
@entity15 have exited the @entity16 at the last 16 stage for the fifth *consecutive* year
@entity1 was @entity4 manager between 1987 and 1994 , winning @entity54 in his debut season
