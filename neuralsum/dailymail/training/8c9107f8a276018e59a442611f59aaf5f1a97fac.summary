@entity0 and @entity1 will meet for the ninth time in wednesday night 's @entity3 semi-final			1
the @entity4 have recorded just one victory over the @entity6 - but it was the most important match of the lot			0
the 1978 @entity3 final in @entity9 saw @entity0 emerge 3 - 1 victors , rendering @entity1 bridesmaids for the second time in four years			1
@entity15 gave @entity0 a first - half lead before a late @entity30 equaliser			2
and in the added 30 minutes , @entity15 bundled @entity0 back in front before @entity32 put the result beyond doubt			0
having lost the 1974 @entity3 final 2 - 1 to @entity35 , @entity1 found themselves heartbroken once again			1
@entity36 , the player of the tournament in 1974 , had retired from international football in october 1977 , but left a @entity6 side still boasting such talent as @entity41 and @entity42			0
aside from 1978 's top scorer @entity15 , @entity0 could count defensive linchpin and captain @entity25 and striker @entity45 among their key men			2
maiden win : the victory brought @entity0 the first of their two @entity51 to date home advantage : @entity0 delivered the @entity3 in front of a partisan crowd in @entity9 @entity25 was a part of the 1986 squad that lifted @entity0 's second and last @entity3			1
the @entity6 have still not shaken off their bridesmaids tag and they were runners - up for a third time in 2010 as @entity61 lifted their first @entity3			0
victory over @entity0 on wednesday night though would give them a fourth bite at the cherry			2
national hero : captain @entity25 would go on to win the @entity3 again in 1986			0

@entity0 play @entity1 in @entity3 semi-final on wednesday night
