to most of us , @entity0 is the brave acid attack victim turned @entity3 model , dedicated philanthropist and , in recent years , something of a national treasure			1
but to fans of @entity9 show @entity8 , she 's also a presenting pro who manages to keep a straight face even when confronted with the most bizarre of body modifications and @entity13 tattoo disasters			1
to those watching as @entity16 , a flight attendant who has spent £ 125,000 on surgery , attempts to drum up some sympathy for his cosmetic surgery ' addiction ' , @entity0 's sympathetic approach can seem bizarre			1
but @entity0 , 31 , who has done more than most to raise awareness about the plight of acid attack victims , says these people are deserving of a fair hearing - even if that is n't apparent at first			1
' we have all done things we regret , ' explains the mother - of - one			0
' but in most cases we can simply wash out that hair dye or take out those earrings			0
' i actually feel really sorry for people like these because whether their appearance was an accident or intentional , it ’s horrible to feel trapped in a body that does n't reflect who you are			1
' this season of @entity8 has so far included @entity56 , a father of five from @entity57 who got a @entity13 tattoo on his face using printer ink while drunk and @entity61 , a @entity62 model who had his cheeks pierced and stretched in the name of art. the latter , says @entity0 , is one of the few who did make her do a double take			1
' he had these holes in his face the size of coke cans , ' she exclaims			0
all change : stars of this series of @entity8 include @entity76 ( left ) and @entity77 lookalike @entity16 distressing : father - of - five @entity56 attempted to remove his tattoos using a cheese grater proud : by contrast , @entity76 is so proud of his inkings , he 's planning to tattoo the rest of his family ' he did it all in the name of art but it was just so impractical for talking and eating and swallowing			1
' equally shocking in @entity0 's eyes are the people who have been left so traumatised by their youthful mistakes , they 've gone to extreme lengths to fix things			1
one such person was @entity56 , who resorted to scrubbing off his tattoos using a cheese grater but was left with scabs all over his face , and a man named @entity101 who took razor blades to his ears			2
' he had had ear stretchers as a teenager and had been left with all this gaping flesh , ' she explains			0
' he had attempted to do a @entity13 reversal and cut into his own flesh with razor blades he had found in the bathroom - that really did shock me			0
' perhaps more shocking though , are those people who say they adore their unusual new look - however bizarre and painful the methods used to achieve it			2
one is @entity116 who wo n't be dissuaded from her quest to get beach ball sized breasts while a contributor from last year 's series is @entity123 who spent £ 3,000 on having holes punched in her cheeks in a bid to get dimples like @entity129 's			2
others , such as @entity76 , a tattoo fan from @entity132 , have transformed themselves completely by getting tattooed from head - to - toe - something that @entity0 says is down to wanting to stand out			2
' the alternative and underground scene is becoming a lot more popular and people are having to find new ways to shock , ' she explains			0
' people tell me it ’s quite addictive - not the actual procedures themselves but the attention that they get and in that sense , i think it is quite an adrenaline rush			0
' not quite so thrilled are those who get inkings done under the influence - something that is becoming increasingly common			0
those to do so include @entity151 , 20 , from @entity152 , who appeared on last year 's show with an arm that bore the legend : ' @entity156 is a t * * t ' and @entity158 , also 20 but from @entity159 , who discovered friends had inked a penis on her shoulder during a drunken party			0
' people should absolutely not get tattoos while under the influence , ' says an animated @entity0			1
' it is such a bad idea			0
oh dear : @entity158 , 20 , from @entity159 , woke up to discover friends had tattooed a penis on her shoulder new mother : @entity0 says she would be horrified if baby @entity172 ( pictured ) got a tattoo in future ' to make the sort of decision that has such an invasive and permanent result when you are drunk is obviously never going to end well			1
' you would never be allowed to have an operation in that state so why tattoos ? ' unsurprisingly , with so many bad examples to choose from , @entity0 says she would be aghast if her 11 - month - old daughter @entity172 tried to get a tattoo of her own one day			1
' if she wanted extreme surgery i would be disappointed and would wonder what i had done wrong , ' says a horrified @entity0			1
' i have always tried to teach her that looks are n’t important			0
' but , she continues , ' if she wanted a tattoo , i would try and remember that i do n’t own her body and she is free to make her own decisions			0
' i bet she gets @entity8 tattooed across her forehead just to get me back			2
that ’s always the way - if children are told not to do something they rebel and do it anyway			0
' if the colourful cast of characters who appear weekly on @entity8 are any indication , so , it seems , do adults .			2

@entity0 , 31 , presents @entity8 , a show about weird surgery
tattoos done under the influence and bizarre body modification feature
@entity0 says people should be more understanding of those who have them
nevertheless , says she does n't want daughter @entity172 to get one
@entity0 presents @entity8 , *tonight* at 10pm on @entity9
