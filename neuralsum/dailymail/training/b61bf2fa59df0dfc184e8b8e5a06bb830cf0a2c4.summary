' no need for notes ' : @entity3 star @entity2 is backing @entity5 's move towards a cashless society after his son was robbed three times @entity5 was the first @entity9 country to introduce bank notes in 1661			1
now it 's come farther than most on the path toward getting rid of them			2
' i ca n't see why we should be printing bank notes at all anymore , ' says @entity2 , former member of 1970s pop group @entity3 and a vocal proponent for a world without cash			1
the contours of such a society are starting to take shape in this high - tech nation , frustrating those who prefer coins and bills over digital money			1
in most @entity5 cities , public buses do n't accept cash - tickets are prepaid or purchased with a cell phone text message			1
a small , but growing number of businesses only take cards and some bank offices — which make money on electronic transactions — have stopped handling cash altogether			2
' there are towns where it is n't at all possible anymore to enter a bank and use cash , ' complains @entity45 , chairman of @entity5 's @entity46			1
he says that 's a problem for elderly people in rural areas who do n't have credit cards or do n't know how to use them to withdraw cash			0
the decline of cash is noticeable even in houses of worship , like the @entity59 in @entity60 , southern @entity5 , where @entity61 recently installed a card reader to make it easier for worshippers to make offerings			1
' people came up to me several times and said they did n't have cash , but would still like to donate money , ' @entity61 says			0
plastic fantastic : vicar @entity61 stands next to a credit card machine in the @entity71 in @entity60 , southern @entity5 , to enable worshippers to donate money without having to carry cash bills and coins represent only three per cent of @entity5 's economy , compared to an average of nine per cent in the eurozone and seven per cent in the @entity80 , according to the @entity81 , an umbrella organization for the world 's central banks			1
three per cent is still too much if you ask @entity2			0
a cashless society may seem like an odd cause for someone who made a fortune on ' @entity89 ' and other @entity3 hits , but for @entity2 it 's a matter of security			0
after his son was robbed for the third time , he started advocating a faster transition to a fully digital economy , if only to make life harder for thieves			0
' if there were no cash , what would they do ? ' says @entity2 , 66			0
the @entity102 says the shrinkage of the cash economy is already making an impact in crime statistics			2
end of the print run ? kronor bills and coins make up just 3 per cent of the economy the number of bank robberies in @entity5 plunged from 110 in 2008 to 16 in 2011 — the lowest level since it started keeping records 30 years ago			1
it says robberies of security transports are also down			0
the prevalence of electronic transactions — and the digital trail they generate — also helps explain why @entity5 has less of a problem with graft than countries with a stronger cash culture , such as @entity126 or @entity127 , says economics professor @entity128 of the @entity129 in @entity130			2
' if people use more cards , they are less involved in shadow economy activities , ' says @entity128 , an expert on underground economies			0
the flip side is the risk of cybercrimes			0
according to the @entity139 for @entity140 , the number of computerized fraud cases , including skimming , surged to nearly 20,000 in 2011 from 3,304 in 2000			0
it 's no surprise that @entity5 and other @entity145 countries are at the forefront of this development , given their emphasis on technology and innovation			1
for the second year in a row , @entity5 ranked first in the @entity153 released at the @entity154 in january			2
the @entity155 also put @entity5 top of its latest digital economy rankings , in 2010			1
both rankings measure how far countries have come in integrating information and communication technologies in their economies .			0

nation was first in @entity9 to bring in notes in 1661
bills and coins now just 3 *%* of @entity5 's economy
bank robberies plunge , but cyber crime surges
