around two thirds of white women breastfed their children compared to 83 per cent of black women and 85 per cent of @entity6 women			1
alcohol is linked to breast cancer and the study showed three - quarters of @entity6 women were non-drinkers , compared with 38 per cent of black women and 23 per cent of white women			1
