@entity2 has always wondered why it was criticised by mr @entity16 and wrongly accused of blocking @entity8 reforms			2
’ it ’s also been suggested @entity35 lawyer @entity4 ’s shock resignation from his @entity8 investigative role in protest at @entity39 ’s summary of his findings might be more to do with his @entity9 observations being ‘ amended ’ than detail involving @entity43 or @entity44			1
@entity21 is unhappy with the deemed blatant interference by @entity8 in this case @entity8 presidential candidate @entity47 said : ‘ something is not right at the heart of @entity8 governance			1
without publishing the @entity4 report in full , @entity8 faces ongoing public suspicion that interference may have occurred			1
’ @entity8 , who called the @entity55 legal marks ‘ standard procedure ’ , claim only five changes were made and say : ‘ there can be no question of @entity8 exerting unfair influence			0
’ @entity63 owner @entity62 continues to send mixed messages out of @entity65 as to whether he wants to sell the @entity67 club			1
but certainly @entity62 prefers to sped this time of year holidaying at the @entity70 resort in @entity71 rather than watching his team in action			0
@entity62 ( right ) , pictured with former @entity63 chairman @entity74 ( left ) , is sending mixed signals over whether or not he wants out of the @entity77 club @entity78 , having flirted with the idea of having racing fan @entity80 present their flagship @entity82 coverage on april 11 to appeal to a wider audience , are understood to be reverting to their normal racing anchor @entity85 in the absence of @entity87 , who has opted to cover the @entity88 for @entity89			1
@entity80 , pictured with wife @entity90 at @entity91 and @entity92 respectively , is a big racing fan lt has n’t helped the turmoil at @entity95 that @entity96 , director of football and friend of the @entity99 owners , has no relationship with manager @entity101 , who is believed to have been sacked and then re-instated on sunday			1
@entity96 has been in his role since before @entity103 when he replaced @entity104			0
before that , he was @entity95 ’s academy director and he has kept out of @entity101 ’s way following a previous falling - out			2

the seven packages are expected to be awarded later in the day			0
although the @entity118 and @entity119 have shown interest , the most likely scenario is that @entity121 will retain four prime packages while @entity110 get an increased number of games , up to 56 out of the 168 live matches being sold per season for three years			0

the @entity134 , whose relationship with @entity8 can hardly get worse , are further exasperated by @entity20 not only dumping the regulation of agents back on national associations but also banning third - party ownership across world football but not giving proper guidance as to how this will work			2
this follows the @entity146 banning emergency loans between clubs despite the @entity8 executive and @entity150 supporting the system — as well as the whole of @entity154 football			2
@entity154 ’s @entity156 - winning women ’s cricket team have posed in contemporary ball gowns for a magazine photoshoot in the @entity160 ’s @entity159 for sponsors @entity161			0
the original idea was for them to wear @entity165 style dresses			0
not a good move after the ‘ @entity172 ’ @entity168 attack launched on @entity154 cricket chief @entity169 by @entity171 ’s cheerleader , @entity170 .			0
