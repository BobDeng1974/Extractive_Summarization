imagine living in a sustainable city with legs that could move anywhere in search of better jobs and resources			0
your postcode would constantly change as you ’re taken around the world on board a gigantic caterpillar - like metropolis			2
it might seem like an absurd concept , but this is exactly what is being proposed by @entity17 - based architectural student @entity16			1
architectural student @entity16 has proposed the development of a sustainable city with legs that could move anywhere in search of a better resources in his vision , the nomadic city would use caterpillar tracks – similar to the ones used for tanks – to move to areas were work for residents is easily available			1
' i wanted to built territorial management between matter and energy , that will bring several positive effects , ' mr @entity16 told @entity38			0
' these include re-equilibrating the population between rural and cities , environment renewal and offering new employment , ' named the ‘ very large structure ’ , the walking metropolis would have everything you ’d expect from a city , including sports facilities , restaurants , universities , hospitals and libraries			1
the nomadic city would use caterpillar tracks - similar to the ones used for tanks - to move to areas were work for residents is easily available named the ' @entity58 ' , the walking metropolis would have everything you 'd expect from a city , including sports facilities , restaurants and universities this basic structure , built on caterpillar tracks , could provide one way of moving an entire city around the world in search of resources this is n’t the first time someone has come up with the idea of a moving city			1
@entity74 architect @entity73 ’s ‘ @entity75 ’ was first proposed in the 1960s			1
in the architecture journal @entity76 , mr @entity73 suggested building huge intelligent robotic structures that could freely roam the world			2
he proposed that various walking cities could interconnect with each other to form larger ' walking metropolises ' when needed , and then disperse			0
the ‘ very large structure ’ develops @entity73 ’s vision by proposing clean energy generation on board using wind turbines , solar panels and hydrogen energy plants			1
mr @entity16 said that the fact that the city moves around could be a way to encourage reforestation rather than destroying the surrounding environment			2
mr @entity16 said that the fact that the city moves around could be a way to encourage reforestation rather than destroying the surrounding environment the design may look like a bizarre concept , but with a number of the world 's major cities in the midst of a slowdown , it may not be as futuristic as you might think it can be easy to dismiss the design as yet another student project			1
but according to mr @entity16 , the very large structure is theoretically possible to build			2
' even though i am very attracted to science fiction and utopical and distopical architecture , i was more interested in investigating real life technology , ' mr @entity16 told @entity38			0
' these included open - air mining machinery , shipyard installations , logistic and management in super-ports and super vessels , space technology and eco-villages			0
' the design may look like a bizarre concept , but with a number of the world ’s major cities in the midst of a slowdown , it may not be as futuristic as you might think			0
' i think it could exist some day maybe at other scale , ' added mr @entity16			0
' maybe in the way it relates and deals with territory , maybe the way in which we built and think about architecture and urbanism , maybe in the way we manage energy and waste			0
' the left image shows the city 's supporting ' foundations grid slab ' where architecture can be built and connected with the installations floor below			0
on the right is the depiction of the very large structure passing over a village the ' @entity58 ' develops @entity73 's vision of a @entity75 by proposing clean energy generation on board using wind turbines , solar panels and hydrogen energy plants			1

named the ‘ very large structure ’ , the design was *created* by @entity17 - based architectural student @entity16
the nomadic city would use caterpillar tracks – similar to the ones used for tanks – to roam around the world
the design builds on an idea proposed almost 50 years *ago* by @entity74 architect @entity73 to develop a ' @entity75 '
