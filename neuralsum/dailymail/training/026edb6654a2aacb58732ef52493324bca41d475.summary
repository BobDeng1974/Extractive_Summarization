by @entity1 reporter last updated at 1:53 pm on 13th september 2011 most people dread the blustery rainy weather and dark mornings of autumn , but for one six - year - old girl the dull days are a blessed relief			0
every time the sun shines little @entity9 is left in excruciating pain from an incurable skin complaint			2
the little girl suffers from rare skin condition porphyria which means she has to be totally covered from harmful rays from the sun every time she leaves home			1
rare condition : @entity19 , from @entity20 , must cover up when out in the sunshine			1
her skin will itch and swell up if she is exposed to the sun 's rays exposure to the sun for even a few seconds will see the youngster 's skin swell and become unbearably painful and itchy			0
@entity19 , from @entity29 , @entity20 , is one of only handful of children in the @entity32 who suffer from the rare genetic condition @entity33			1
her brother and sister are both clear of the condition			0
the schoolgirl has even dubbed rainy and overcast days ' @entity19 's weather ' as these are the only days she can venture outside without sunblock and a range of measures to keep her safe			1
still smiling : @entity9 and parents @entity45 and @entity46 at home in @entity20 , the schoolgirl has a rare skin condition which means she must avoid the sun 's rays every day @entity19 is forced to wear sunscreen , hats and gloves to shield her skin from the sun and must use an umbrella when she leaves the house			1
her mother @entity45 first realised something was wrong when @entity19 was just three years old and her hands started to swell up			1
@entity33 is an extremely painful condition which is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme ferrochelatase			0
high levels of this in the skin results in the unbearable itching that sufferers must endure			0
the condition usually presents when a child and mostly affects the upper surfaces of arms , legs and the feet			0
if the @entity33 is serious a sufferer can loose skin in sheets after severe blistering due to sun exposure			1
normal anti-itch creams and treatments can not soothe the unbearable itching and the main treatment is preventative by covering the skin			0
because the condition can cause nerve damage sufferers often present with symptoms of muscle weakness			0
she said : ' @entity19 's hands became swollen into the shape of a claw and we took her to @entity93 where she underwent tests			1
' she was transferred to @entity96 's @entity95 , where the doctors at first thought she had an allergy to something			0
' the family kept a diary of @entity19 's ailments as doctors battled to discover why the youngster 's face and hands were swelling up and causing her pain			1
eventually medics diagnosed @entity33 and @entity19 and her family have been able to safeguard her from the sun. the family car has even had its windows darkened so that the little girl can travel safely			2
mrs @entity9 added : ' it 's really sad when the rest of the family is out sunbathing and enjoying the sun , and @entity19 can not join in			2
' but she knows how she can suffer in sunlight and will say , ' i do n't want that , mammy ! ' so holidays in hot countries abroad are a no - no and apart from her hat , gloves , umbrella and sun block , we even have the windows of the car protected , in case the rays of the sun affect @entity19 's skin			1
' it is thought that @entity33 is a condition caused by a genetic disorder and that both mrs @entity9 and her husband @entity138 have the faulty gene and have passed it on to @entity19			2
mrs @entity9 adding : ' it 's thought that @entity46 and i both have the faulty gene , which has caused @entity19 's condition , which has not affected our other children , @entity145 , four , and nine - year - old @entity146			2
' a lot of research is taking place in the @entity150 into porphyria and @entity33 and we would like to increase awareness of the condition in this country and help to raise money for research			0

@entity19 must remain fully covered outdoors to avoid her skin swelling and blistering
