by @entity0 last updated at 5:52 pm on 18th november 2011 hordes of shoppers besieged @entity4 stores across the globe as @entity7 's collection for the high street shop went on sale today			1
with many shoppers having spent the night queuing on the pavements outside , there were scenes of hysteria at 9am as the eager crowds were finally let in to fill their arms with brightly printed garments from the shelves			2
in @entity20 and @entity21 where 9am had come and gone , shoppers reported @entity4 stores selling out of the entire collection in under 30 minutes - with many pieces arriving on @entity26 moments later			1
success : @entity7 arrives at the @entity4 store on @entity30 's @entity29 this morning to celebrate the launch of her collection for @entity4 glamorous : @entity7 wore a £ 129.99 pink satin dress and a £ 199.99 leather trench coat , both from the collection fail : @entity4 's website crashed under the large number of users trying to buy the collection sorry : @entity4 took to @entity40 to apologise for their technical issues @entity7 herself made an appearance at @entity30 's @entity29 store to welcome her fans , stepping out of her chauffeur - driven car onto a pink carpet , clad in a nipped - in version of @entity53 x @entity4 pink leather dress and a studded leather coat from the range			1
in the store , sales assistants dressed in top - to - toe @entity53 designs attempted to corral the high - spirited shoppers into a second waiting zone , where they would be held until their ten minute shopping slot came round			0
online , @entity4 's website crashed under the demand as thousands tried to log on simultaneously			1
a spokesperson for the store took to @entity40 to apologise for ' technical problems ' , saying they were ' working hard to solve them			1
' in the melée , rogue shoppers who had jumped the queue attempted to grab items from over the fence , but dozens of extra security guards and shop assistants made sure no attempt at queue - jumping was successful			0
the first shoppers through the door frantically tore clothes from shelves and rails , loading their arms with dresses , jackets and accessories while security guards counted down the minutes - in some stores , blowing a whistle to let shoppers know their time slot was up			0
but many - especially male shoppers - were left disappointed when they found much of the men 's collection that had been previewed was not to be found in the store			0
nightwatch : shoppers queued in the early hours to ensure they did n't miss out pleased : shoppers at @entity97 's @entity96 show off their purchases ... where moments after the doors had opened , the shelves were bare shopped out : an entire new @entity53 wardrobe for @entity104 , fashion stylist and blogger at @entity106 stylish : @entity107 , left , attended the launch , while @entity109 , right , leaves @entity4 with her coveted @entity53 purchases one @entity30 student , @entity111 , 21 , was first in line at the @entity114 branch of @entity4 , having arrived with girlfriend @entity115 , 21 , at 10pm last night			1
but he was not able to buy the pieces he had earmarked online ahead of the opening day			2
' there were none of the suits that showed on the catwalk , and very few jackets , ' he said this morning			0
' i got a few t - shirts , but that was all			0
' @entity53 fans in the queue also reported their dismay at the number of those waiting already making plans to sell their booty on auction site @entity26			1
many in the queue brought along laptops and were charting the prices of the @entity53 for @entity4 collection on @entity26			1
rules were in place to prevent a reoccurrence of the issues experienced on previous celebrity collaboration opening days , where fights broke out in the hysterical crush and opportunistic @entity26 sellers arrived in their droves to empty entire racks of identical items into huge laundry bags that they sold at vastly inflated prices that same day			2
devoted : from left , @entity153 , 22 , @entity111 and @entity115 , both 21 , were first in line , having queued since 10pm the previous night big spenders : from left , at the @entity162 launch , @entity157 , @entity158 and @entity159 spent over £ 1,200 on the collection triumphant : three ladies carry their booty home after filling their bags during their allotted 10 minutes worthwhile trip : @entity170 and @entity171 travelled from @entity172 to queue at the @entity114 store - their nearest			2
' next time they should launch the collection in more stores outside of @entity30 , like @entity180 , for instance ' they said , although both agreed the trip was a success hordes : security guards attempted to keep the ever - growing queues under control as more and more shoppers joined the line frantic : shoppers load up their arms with pieces from the collection			2
right , a man buys numerous boxes containing jewellery , shoes and accessories authentic : the shoppers snapped up the vibrant pieces , which were said to be ' very @entity7 ' time 's up ! a @entity97 store assistant blows a whistle to let shoppers know their ten minutes is up line up : these @entity7 bags wo n't stay empty for long choices , choices : shoppers could only buy one of each size in every garment this time around , @entity4 in the @entity212 made sure everything was well organised , with wristbands allowing pre-allotted 10 minute time slots and limits on the number of items each shopper could buy , with only one item in each size permitted to each shopper			1
the same rules did not apply elsewhere , however , and shoppers in @entity20 and @entity21 reported queuing for nearly 24 hours ahead of the collection 's release but still being disappointed when the first few through the doors cleaned the shelves			0
a disappointed shopper who had queued outside the @entity20 store told @entity232 that a ten minute , invite - only vip preview meant that by the time regular shoppers were allowed in , most of the best items were gone			0
with no limits in place , the rest of the items were cleared from the rails in multiples by the first swathe of shoppers - many of which were clearly to be sold on later - leaving the shelves bare in under an hour			0
it is the latest in a long line of collaborations that has seen @entity4 partner with @entity251 , @entity252 and @entity253 , and has been heavily promoted since it was announced this autumn			1
the collection , which starts at £ 19.99 for jewellery going up to £ 199.99 for a leather jacket , was launched in a glittering fashion show held in @entity260 's @entity259 last week , and saw @entity261 , @entity262 , @entity263 and @entity264 attend , all clad in items from the label			0
