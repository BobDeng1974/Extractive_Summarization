the 27 - year - old was dropped for two months last season after a costly mistake against @entity32 but bounced back well to reclaim his place and collect a second @entity34 medal in three seasons			0
however , @entity0 said he regarded both @entity4 and @entity26 , 32 , as first - choice goalkeepers after signing the @entity37 from his former club @entity38			0
