there was shock and disappointment in the @entity3 this week when an absentee landlord told two employees that , after decades of service , they wo n’t be needed on his farm after @entity8			1
from the employees ’ point of view this is obviously upsetting			2
but when the landlord is @entity15 and the farm is on the @entity17 , a remote part of @entity18 he once loved as a family hideaway and then made famous musically in one of his biggest hits , people around the world take notice — and wonder why this might be happening			1
in one of the shots taken at the farm @entity15 bought at the height of the @entity30 fame , @entity24 is pregnant with daughter @entity31 it ’s believed the former @entity30 has rarely spent much time on his vast 600 - acre farm since his first wife @entity24 died in 1998 , and that the house has fallen into a state of some disrepair			1
that ’s sad for a once much - loved home , but it also reveals a touching trait of human nature that we all share			2
@entity46 was the first home @entity15 and @entity24 created together			1
he ’d bought it in 1966 when living with actress @entity48 , but it was only after he married country - loving @entity24 in 1969 that he began to spend much time there			1
i ’d known @entity15 since 1967 when we met on the filming of the @entity56			1
but the first i ever heard about @entity46 was early in 1970			1
@entity15 , pictured with his late wife @entity24 and their children , has told employees at @entity46 that their services will no longer be needed after @entity8 we were sitting in a fish restaurant in @entity64 and @entity15 , with @entity24 at his side , was rhapsodising about the mud and the simplicity of the place , about not having a bathroom and how he ’d made the furniture , fixed leaks in the roof and sheared a sheep			1
it sounded to me like some kind of hippy purgatory in endless , lashing rain , but he insisted he loved it			2
the @entity30 had secretly broken up the previous autumn , and he ’d been devastated			2
playing with the band had been the only job he ’d ever had , and , unemployed though rich , he ’d gone to @entity81 to grieve			2
@entity15 with children @entity82 and @entity31 in @entity81 in 1982 , captured by his late wife @entity24 @entity15 cradles a lamb in his lap while @entity24 cuddles him in this intimate shot at @entity46 after seven years during which he ’d never been out of the world ’s microscopic gaze , his only need was the comfort of his wife , and daughters @entity93 and @entity95			1
he would say later that , in his despair , he flirted with hard drugs while there , but that would have been only a momentary aberration as @entity24 , @entity17 and @entity100 , in all the kindness of her sometimes inclement weather on the @entity17 , set about healing him			1
‘ i ’m not some kind of hermit or recluse with a long beard having an awful time , ’ he told me that day			2
‘ it ’s a tramp ’s life and i can wear the same shirt for ages up there			0
i need to get with the earth a bit			0
’ indeed , as he sang in @entity118 on the @entity30 ’ @entity117 , love it he did			0
and as the @entity15 family added @entity31 and @entity82 , and the house near @entity121 took shape around them , @entity24 coaxed @entity15 ’s confidence back			1
sitting with his acoustic guitar , some of his best @entity127 songs were written there in the heather in the early @entity131 , while @entity24 took her photographs of him and the children			1
for generations , rich englishmen have bought great estates in @entity81 , and taken their smart friends up to shoot the animals and birds			0
but toffing and killing was never the @entity142 ’ way			0
and the local people admired them for it			0
animals were never shot at @entity46 : quite the reverse			1
it was while having sunday lunch with the children , watching young lambs bouncing happily in the field , that the entire family suddenly pushed aside the roast on their plates and decided to become vegetarians			0
later @entity24 , with an evangelistic fervour , would create a whole range of vegetarian foods			1
the west of @entity81 was n’t the handiest place for an international rock star to bring up his family , so another estate was found in @entity165			0
there , once again , the @entity142 started with a small house followed by a much bigger one and more and more land was added			0
but always their homestead on the @entity17 was waiting for holidays			1
wings : @entity24 and @entity15 , with @entity172 strolling in the heather during filming of the promotional film for their @entity17 single then , in 1998 , @entity24 died , and the visits to @entity46 became fewer			1
in his solitude , the memories of a family starting out 30 years earlier in this place of romantic isolation would have both comforted him and lanced the pain of his loss			0
by now , all the @entity15 children were grown up with their own lives to lead			1
the @entity81 farm had been a part of @entity15 ’s life with @entity24			1
without her , it was n’t the same			0
now he has a new @entity196 wife and life and several other homes , even his helicopter visits to his @entity165 house are fewer , and he ’s rarely been busier			2
this week he ’s flitting from tv studio to radio microphone promoting a new album			0
speaking about his country life , he once told me : ‘ i do all the things everybody else does			2
the only difference is i ’m more famous and richer than they are			0
’ and , like all of us , it seems to me that @entity15 is moving on , as he has to , as we all have to — though it is n’t easy			2
how many of us think fondly of our childhood home , picturing its cosiness , almost smelling the polish on the furniture ? or do we see home as the sanctuary we decorated as newly - weds , where we ladled @entity218 into gaps in the plaster , then later watched as our young children rolled and giggled on our proud new carpets ? @entity46 , where @entity15 and @entity223 first lived after they were married we think we ’d like to go back , but we know we ca n’t			1
as @entity15 is no longer the 26 - year - old restarting his life in the ‘ mists that rolled in from the sea ’ , as he told us in @entity17 , we are not the same people we were either			1
@entity229 changes us and the people we shared those moments of our lives with have changed , too ; some to leave us , some to grow up , some sadly to die			0
and without those loved ones , the place will neither look nor feel the same			0
often , against your better judgment , you revisit a place you loved 20 years ago — only to be confronted by a noisy holiday village and sun - worshippers occupying almost every grain of sand			0
obviously , it ’s good that more people can enjoy the sunshine , the sea and the sun , you might try to think , but , in your heart you ’re with @entity250 when she sang : ‘ they paved paradise , put up a parking lot			0
’ in truth , we should n’t even try to go back			0
it rarely works , seductive though the memories may be			0
the word in @entity81 is that @entity15 wants to discuss with the @entity259 new ways to manage his land			2
does that mean he wants to turn it back to the historic , natural woodland it would have been before sheep farming overran @entity81 , as some environmentalists now advocate ? it would n’t surprise me			0
but we ’ll have to wait and see			0
in the meantime , though the ‘ smiles in the sunshine and tears in the rain ’ he once sang about are long behind him , the memories of @entity17 will remain			2
he , like us , will always have the memories , often better preserved if we do n’t try to relive @entity277 for the staff about to lose their jobs at @entity46 , i ’m sure a comfortable compensation will be negotiated			1
the @entity282 is now available as an ebook			0

@entity46 was the first home of @entity15 and @entity223
staff have been told services are not required after @entity8 at the farm
visits to @entity17 became fewer after @entity24 died in 1998
