by @entity0 published : 12:18 est , 10 december 2012 updated : 02:50 est , 11 december 2012 on the eve of the release of @entity6 's version of the @entity7 , researchers in @entity2 have revealed what the early human dubbed the ' hobbit human ' really looks like			2
researchers analysed the homo floresiensis unearthed by professor @entity12 and the @entity14 archaeological team in @entity15 , @entity16 in 2003			1

the 3 - foot ( 1 - metre ) tall , 30 - year - old female based on remains that were uncovered in the @entity14 cave on the remote @entity16 island of @entity15 in 2003 since the discovery , scientists have debated whether the specimen actually represents an extinct species in the human family tree , perhaps a diminutive offshoot of @entity40 , a 1.8 - million - year - old hominid and the first to have body proportions comparable to those of modern @entity44			1
' in the media it 's often called ' facial reconstruction ' , but because i 'm evidence - based and work in archaeological science , we prefer the term ' facial approximation ' , ' dr @entity20 said			2
the project , marking the beginning of the @entity57 ( @entity58 ) conference being hosted by @entity59 from 9 - 13 december , involved dr @entity20 applying her methods to a very different female individual			0
she was given access to the very significant remains of @entity25 floresiensis unearthed by professor @entity12 and the @entity14 archaeological team in @entity15 , @entity16 in 2003			1
dr @entity20 described the facial approximation as an extraordinary challenge working on an archaic hominin			0
' she 's taken me a bit longer than i 'd anticipated , has caused more than a few headaches along the way , but i 'm pleased with both the methodological development and the final results			0
