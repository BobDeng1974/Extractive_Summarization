@entity0 made a @entity2 cabbie 's day by inviting him backstage to his @entity4 show after the two bonded over his films and @entity6			1
proving himself every bit as warm - hearted as his roles onscreen , the actor was so grateful that a tired driver put off going home after his shift to make one last journey , the he gave him free tickets and a backstage pass as a reward			2
the cab driver - known as mr @entity26 for his love of the clothes sporting the car company 's logo - told how he picked up @entity0 without knowing who he was , and bonded with him over a cheeky reference to one of his films			1
the unlikely encounter , which took place on a journey through @entity46 , came after @entity0 flagged down mr @entity26 on @entity47 and asked him for a ride to 74th st. he did n't recognize @entity0 immediately - as he had his cap pulled low over his face - and said he was n't going that way so could n't take him			1
but he changed his mind shortly after and took him anyway			2
' @entity53 ' : the pair bonded after mr @entity26 made a reference to @entity0 's character in @entity57 ( left ) , who made an imaginary friend called @entity57 ( right ) from a blood - smeared volleyball he said : ' i think about it , and i start feeling bad for the guy , cause hey - i got a conscience			1
so i call him back to the cab and tell him to hop in ' , according to @entity66 of @entity2 blog			0
his act of kindness is eventually rewarded months later when another passenger who knows @entity0 forwards an exclusive invitation to see mr @entity73 's @entity4 debut - then meet him backstage afterwards			1
the two got along during the journey after mr @entity26 made a reference to @entity0 's character in the 2000 film @entity57 , and @entity0 took a liking to his driver 's sportswear			1
describing the encounter , the driver recalled : ' ... he gets in the car all excited , all animated , and he 's talking about all these things			0
but he 's got his cap pulled down way over his eyes , so i ca n't see who it is			0
' ' but pretty soon i start to recognize his voice			0
and when we get to a light , i turn to him , and i look him in the eye , and i scream : " @entity93 ! ! ! " and that really got him			0
' the two then reportedly struck up a friendship over the cabbie 's penchant for @entity26 gear - he was wearing a cap and a shift at the time			1
at the end of the journey the two took a selfie together on the street			0
mr @entity26 then said he found himself picking up people who knew or had worked with @entity0 - and every time forwarded a greeting ' from mr @entity26 '			1
@entity4 debut : @entity0 was starring in @entity111 at the time - between april and july 2013 and when one acquaintance sent the greeting on via text message he finally got a reply - and the offer to meet again			1
the driver said : ' then one day i ’m driving , and i get a text from one of the people that i ’d driven , and it says : " mr. @entity0 wants to invite you to see his @entity4 show			2
" ' so i bring my lady to the show , and we get to go backstage and everything , and after the show , we ’re waiting for him in his dressing room , and he walks in and screams : " mr. @entity26 ! " ... the name of his show was @entity111			0
how crazy is that ? cause that was me			0
a lucky guy ! " the cab driver does not reveal exactly when either the initial ride nor the visit backstage took place			0
but @entity111 's @entity4 run lasted from april 1 2013 to july 3 the same year			2
@entity140 has contacted @entity0 's agent for comment .			0
