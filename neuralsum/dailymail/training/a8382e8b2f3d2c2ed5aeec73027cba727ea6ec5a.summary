@entity1 captain @entity0 once again got his name on the scoresheet at @entity4 , but despite notching for the 15th consecutive campaign , the former @entity6 captain is second behind @entity8 in the list of the top goalscoring @entity12 defenders			1
@entity0 showed great body strength and power to hold off his marker @entity16 to put @entity1 on their way to their 13th win of the season at the @entity20 on monday night			0
throughout his time at @entity24 , the @entity22 stalwart has netted some crucial strikes , with a total of 35 league goals an impressive tally for a defender			0
the most crucial of these goals came on a wet and windy day in @entity42 , as a thunderous spot kick sealed a dramatic final day victory over @entity45 that ensured his @entity35 side stayed in the top flight for another season			0
the majority of @entity8 's goals came during two stints at @entity53 , with the robust centre back famously rejoining the @entity53 a matter of hours after moving to @entity56 from @entity57			2
@entity8 celebrates a converted spot kick for @entity59 in 2004 ( left ) , and after scoring for @entity53 in 1999 @entity0 helped his side at both ends of the pitch to help @entity1 seal their first @entity12 crown in 2005 free - kick specialist @entity64 lies seven behind @entity0 , but in the twilight of his career at @entity68 , he is unlikely to catch the @entity1 veteran			1
@entity53 's penalty taker @entity71 is a real threat to @entity0 with 26 goals to his name , while former @entity76 and @entity1 defender @entity75 completes the top five , and is the second highest scorer from open play			1
@entity8 - 38 @entity0 - 35 @entity64 - 28 @entity71 - 26 @entity75 - 25 @entity0 himself has scored several crucial goals for @entity1 throughout his career , and played a major role in several title challenges in the opposition 's penalty area			1
an equaliser against @entity76 , the then reigning champions , at @entity87 in 2004 was certainly vital in helping @entity1 secure their first top flight title in 50 years			0
even more pivotal , @entity0 's late winner against title rivals @entity90 at @entity24 in 2010 earned the @entity22 a last - gasp victory as the title race went down to the wire			0
and after admitting there is still life in his weary limbs yet , @entity0 has time to overtake @entity8 , and write himself yet further into @entity1 and @entity12 folklore .			2

@entity0 has now found the net in 15 consecutive seasons
from open play , @entity0 is the @entity12 's top goalscoring defender
but including penalties , @entity8 is the most *prolific* with 38
@entity0 is three behind on 35 , with @entity64 on *32* and @entity71 25
