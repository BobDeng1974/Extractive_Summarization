@entity0 vetoed plans for a ' patronising ' @entity3 election slogan which said ' well done you ' in an attempt to thank voters for putting up with spending cuts			1
according to one source , the slogan was dreamed up by advertising agency @entity10 , which is working on the @entity3 ' campaign ahead of may 's poll			1
but it was quickly rejected by the chancellor , who said it was ' patronising and insensitive '			1
a source said : ' there was general astonishment when it was suggested ' well done you ' was a good message			2
it is patronising and would rightly have been greeted with a large raspberry by the electorate			2
' we already have a struggle on our hands to rebut @entity42 claims that @entity43 and @entity0 are rich and out of touch			1
short of putting a picture of @entity47 on it , i ca n't think of anything worse			2
' it did n't take very long for @entity0 to tear it up			1
' @entity10 went back to the drawing board and later produced the far more successful image of @entity42 leader @entity54 peering out of the top pocket of former @entity57 first minister @entity56			1
the agency was set up in 1995 by @entity59 and @entity60			2
the brothers ' previous firm , @entity10 and @entity63 , designed @entity64 's famous ' @entity42 is n't @entity66 ' poster in the run - up to the 1979 election			1
last night a @entity3 spokesman said of the slogans : ' we do not talk about campaign matters			1
' @entity73 is banking on female ' floating voters ' @entity73 is banking on female ' floating voters ' to save the @entity76 from an election wipeout			0
officials revealed they were targeting ' undecided ' women voters in the party 's vital marginal seats			0
they cited research across 18 seats showing women switching to the @entity76 as polling day approaches			0
aides to mr @entity73 boasted that women warmed to party pledges such as improving mental health treatment and cutting income tax by Â£ 400			0
one said : ' our progress since 2014 suggests we are winning the battle for women voters			0
' mr @entity73 , who launches his election campaign today , will spend the opening days supporting the party 's ' key female candidates '			0
he will also unveil the @entity76 ' battle bus , complete with radio transmitter so he can do his call - in radio show on the road			0
