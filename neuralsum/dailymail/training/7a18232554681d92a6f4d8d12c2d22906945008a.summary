by @entity0 published : 10:57 est , 10 april 2013 updated : 20:06 est , 10 april 2013 @entity1 , 11 , spent nine days in hospital after her newly pierced ear became infected an 11 - year - old schoolgirl was forced to spend more than a week in hospital after her newly - pierced ear became infected			1
@entity1 , from @entity6 , needed eight stitches and iv antibiotics after the ear swelled dramatically			1
she is now facing a six week recovery period and the possibility of being scarred for life			1
@entity1 had the top of her ear pierced on march 1 and , while it was fine for the first two weeks , it soon became infected			1
the schoolgirl returned to the beauty parlour in @entity17 , where the initial piercing was carried out and explained the problem			2
the staff removed the earring , cleaned her ear , and put a new earring in			1
they also insisted they could not be blamed for an infection that took hold three weeks after the piercing			1
@entity1 ’s mother , @entity28 , 37 , said : ‘ it was okay for two weeks			1
it 's not the first piercing that has caused the real damage			0
‘ i know there is a risk with ear piercing			0
it 's what they did the second time when she went back that is my main concern			0
’ by the time she got home from the salon , @entity46 ’s ear had ‘ doubled in size ’ , her mother claims			1
seeing the swelling , she took her daughter to the doctor who gave her antibiotics			2
this failed to resolve the problem which just got progressively worse			0
eventually , @entity1 was admitted to @entity53 on march 26 where she had the wound lanced and stitched up before she was discharged three days later			1
@entity46 ( pictured with mother , @entity56 ) is now facing a six week recovery period and the possibility of being scarred for life however , she then had to be readmitted on april 2 and was kept in for six days while she was given antibiotics through a drip			1
ms @entity1 said : ‘ she had it lanced twice and she had surgery on it twice			1
after that she was on an iv drip of antibiotics			2
‘ they put two drains in it because the blood was collecting in her ear and the infection had rotted her cartilage			2
‘ she has actually lost some of that cartilage			0
she is a pretty girl and it could have a big impact on her life			0
the surgeon has said it could take up to six weeks to heal			0
’ ms @entity1 has raised concerns about the treatment her daughter received from the tattoo and piercing studio			2
however , @entity85 , master body piercer at @entity87 , the piercing and tattoo parlour that @entity1 visited , said his team carry out hundreds of ear piercings every week without any complaints and had followed stringent guidelines			1
the salon that pierced @entity46 's ear claims it can not be responsible for an infection that appeared three weeks after the piercing mr @entity85 added that if his shop had caused the infection it would have been apparent within 24 hours , not three weeks later			1
he said : ‘ we pierce a lot of people 's ears , more people in @entity106 than anyone probably , and this is a first for us			0
‘ i do n't re-use anything , everything is n't cleaned , it 's thrown away			2
‘ the drill goes away and is sterilised at a warehouse			0
there is no chance of infection			0
‘ if it was after about 24 hours i might think to myself something has gone wrong here , but three weeks later it 's clearly not to do with us			2
’ he added that in very rare cases people can be allergic to the titanium used in all their piercings			0
he said : ‘ we take it out and put a plastic one in if that 's the case			0
‘ she would have got instructions on how to clean it			0
we give them free sea salt and instructions on how to use it			0

@entity140 gave her antibiotics but they did not work and the infection got worse
