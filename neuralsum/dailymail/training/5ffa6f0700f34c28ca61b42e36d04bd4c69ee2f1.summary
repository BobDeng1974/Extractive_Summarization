@entity1 chairman @entity0 accused comparison sites of ' behaving more like backstreet market traders ' rip - off price comparison websites are under pressure to compensate customers who lost out because they were kept in the dark about cheap energy deals			1
mps on the @entity1 committee have accused industry giants of acting like back street market traders to boost their profits at the expense of families struggling to pay for heat and light			1
the companies in the firing line are @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 , which spend millions on tv ads presenting themselves as the consumer champions			1
mps said the firms set up their websites in such a way that people shopping around for cheaper gas and electricity were directed towards suppliers that pay them millions in commission			1
customers searching for better tariffs were presented with a drop - down menu of energy firms that pay commission , rather than a list of all the deals available , including cheaper options from small suppliers			1
the net result was that the firms collected a payment of £ 50 - £ 70 for each dual fuel switch , while consumers may have ended up paying hundreds of pounds more than they needed to			0
in a report published today , the committee said the firms should pay compensation to all the customers who missed out on the cheapest energy deal as a result of the suspect tactics			1
the @entity56 chairman of the committee , @entity0 mp , said : ‘ consumers trust price comparison services to help them switch to the best energy deals available on the market			1
' but some energy price comparison sites have been behaving more like backstreet market traders than the trustworthy consumer champions they make themselves out to be in adverts on tv			1
‘ some comparison sites have used misleading language to dupe consumers into opting for default options that only display commission earning deals			1
the site defended themselves by saying they operate according to the standards of an industry code approved by @entity76 ' and others have previously gone so far as to conceal deals that do not earn them commission behind multiple drop - down web options			2
’ he added : ‘ as an immediate and essential first step towards rebuilding confidence , the companies should compensate any consumers who have been encouraged to switch to tariffs that may not have been the cheapest or most appropriate for their needs			0
’ however , the @entity89 has no power to force the firms to pay compensation beyond the pressure to ‘ name and shame ’			0
@entity8 are concerned that consumers are kept in the dark about the commission payments and believe there is a good case for making website disclose the amount when a customer decides to switch			2
mr @entity0 said : ‘ we have no objection to commission being paid by suppliers to price comparison websites as long as the arrangements are clearly disclosed			0
’ the committee is also calling on the industry regulator @entity76 to set up a new licensing regime for price comparison websites to replace existing voluntary codes in order to ensure they give customers a fair deal			2
the chairman said : ‘ the current hands - off approach is clearly not working and the lack of contrition from some companies even when faced with proof that they misled customers has convinced us that some form of licensing of energy price comparison sites may be needed			2
‘ if the government wants more people to switch energy supplier then it has to ensure that energy price comparison services are transparent and trusted			0
‘ we recognise that the criticisms contained in this report do not apply across all price comparison websites			0
' we hope that the debate sparked by this report on how price comparison websites operate will provide all sites – both good and bad – with an opportunity to take stock of their operations and strive for greater transparency			0
’ @entity147 hit back at the @entity8 , accusing them of being sensationalist			1
mps said the firms set up their websites in such a way that people shopping around for cheaper gas and electricity were directed towards suppliers that pay them millions in commission a spokesman said : ‘ we have never misled customers and are very disappointed by the sensationalist approach of making broad brush accusations against the whole industry			1
‘ within the report , the @entity89 does concede that their criticisms do not pertain to all price comparison websites			0
' we have always maintained we are totally transparent and only make money when people save money			0
’ @entity19 said it has paid compensation in the ‘ rare ’ cases where customers may have been misled			2
chief executive , @entity172 , said : ‘ price comparison websites have a vital role to play in making the energy market work for consumers			0
' our simple , free to use service saved consumers £ 112 million on their energy bills last year			0
‘ customers have the clear choice to compare plans on our website across the whole energy market			2
' in line with our complaints process , we have made payments to customers in the very rare occasions where we have fallen short of our strict procedures over the phone			0
’ @entity23 said : ‘ we constantly review our website to identify any changes needed , and have already made improvements to our energy comparison service which we believe will encourage people to make an active decision regarding their energy tariffs			0
’ @entity20 and @entity22 both said they operate according to the standards of an industry code approved by @entity76 .			1

@entity1 committee slam industry giants in report

@entity8 say they direct customers to energy firms that pay commission
this is rather than listing all the deals available , including cheaper options
