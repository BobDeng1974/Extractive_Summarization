@entity0 has not showered for 12 years but prefers to spritz himself with bacteria most of us spend substantial amounts of time and money washing germs off our skin and hair			1
however , according to one chemical engineer , we should be spraying them on instead			2
indeed , @entity0 has not showered for 12 years but prefers to spritz himself with bacteria : ammonia - oxidising bacteria ( @entity13 ) , to be precise			1
mr @entity0 , an @entity14 , first became interested in the power of these micro-organisms , which live in soil , rivers and the ocean , when his girlfriend asked why her horse kept rolling around in the dirt			1
the scientist eventually discovered that the animals developed this behaviour to ensure they get enough bacteria on their bodies to stop their sweat from putrefying and smelling in the hot summer months			1
human sweat works in exactly the same way , breaking down into ammonia , which smells but which can be neutralised by the presence of @entity13			1
the problem is that , due to our modern insistence on hygiene , most of us no longer have any of these good bacteria living on our bodies			2
mr @entity0 ’s skin , though , boasts billions			1
for the last 12 years he has sprayed himself with @entity13 that he has collected from soil in the pigsty , cowshed and chicken coop of an organic farm			0
he washes his hands with a bar of soap before touching food and after going to the lavatory , but otherwise relies on an occasional rubdown with a sponge – and a regular spray of @entity54 as he calls his concoction			0
the problem is that , due to our modern insistence on hygiene , most of us no longer have any of these good bacteria living on our bodies he has also made the product available to other reluctant washers			2
‘ @entity61 is the new black , wear it every day ’ is the firm ’s slogan			0
he promises it will give users softer skin and a smoother complexion			0
remarkably , sales have been so high that the mist is currently out of stock			0
the company is now developing products that they say could cure eczema and skin allergies as well as heal wounds .			0
