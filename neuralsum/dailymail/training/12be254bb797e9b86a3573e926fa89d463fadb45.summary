she was ordered to observe a strict curfew requiring her to stay at home between 9pm and 7am for a period of three months , which forced her to give up her job at a local bar			1
when staff from @entity37 fitted the tag they told her she would be allowed to decorate it however she wanted , she claims			1
' the lady who fitted the item said she saw a girl from @entity8 who had blinged her tag , and she said i could do that , ' @entity1 said			1
' i saw pictures of it online and checked the leaflet , and nowhere did it say i could n't decorate it			2
' but when she moved home in december and had to be fitted with a new tag , @entity37 workers saw the decoration and reported her to the authorities			2
the company argued in court that @entity59 had ' compromised the integrity ' of the device with her diamanté design			1
' bling ' : @entity1 was inspired by @entity8 to add decoration to the monitor upset : @entity1 , pictured today without her tag , claimed the whole case was a waste of time and money magistrates agreed , telling the defendant she had committed a ' very serious offence ' and slapping her with a £ 55 fine , along with £ 85 court costs and a £ 20 victim support surcharge			1
speaking after her court appearance , @entity59 said the ' petty ' case had gone too far			0
' i would n't have wasted my time doing it if i knew i was going to be fined for it , ' she said			0
' it 's a massive waste of time and money			0
there are all these people who go out and breach their orders , and all i 've done is decorate my tag - that 's just not right			2
' i was actually proud of decorating the tag at the time			0
i wanted to make it look nice while i had it strapped to me around the house , it was a personal thing			0
offence : @entity1 was given the tag after being caught fighting outside a @entity26 nightclub , pictured ' @entity95 say i damaged the tag , but i did n't - i did n't touch the sensor , it was still working and i was being monitored			1

i was quite proud of it			0
i like to bling things up , and wear blingy clothes and watches			0
it just matched my style			0
