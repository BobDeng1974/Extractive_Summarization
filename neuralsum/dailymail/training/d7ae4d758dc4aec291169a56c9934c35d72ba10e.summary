@entity6 in @entity7 was declared inadequate after a visit by @entity9 in june			1
inspectors criticised ‘ weak and inadequate ’ teaching and said pupils were not making the progress they were capable of despite above average results			1
' inadequate ' : @entity6 for boys has been placed in special measures following an @entity9 inspection students were well behaved as they moved around the school but this was ‘ not always carried through to lessons ’ where their attitudes to learning were directly linked to the quality of teaching			1
behaviour in lessons had ‘ declined ’ , with students losing ‘ interest and motivation ’ when teaching was not good enough			2
students in all year groups , including the sixth form , reported low - level disruption in lessons that was hindering learning			2
another area of concern was ‘ inconsistent and irregular ’ marking , with teachers assessing work ‘ infrequently ’			0
some ‘ focused on correcting presentation rather than specific advice on how to improve students ’ knowledge and understanding of the subject ’			0
the report said : ‘ the quality of learning and the quality of feedback students receive depends too much on the individual qualities of the teacher			0
‘ some students perceive that they are " lucky " if the teaching they receive is good or outstanding and they would like their work to be marked by some teachers more frequently			0
