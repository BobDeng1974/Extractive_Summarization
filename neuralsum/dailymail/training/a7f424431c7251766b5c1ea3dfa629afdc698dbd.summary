by @entity0 published : 06:14 est , 29 april 2013 updated : 09:11 est , 29 april 2013 a revolutionary renewable power scheme dubbed ' @entity3 ' could provide cheap heat for @entity5 , it emerged today			1
@entity5 's first commercial - scale venture to convert canine excrement into bio-gas that can be used to power a turbine is set be unveiled after three years of development work			1
@entity12 - based firm @entity11 is the brainchild of @entity14 , a former @entity15 banker now living in @entity16 , who has persuaded an unnamed @entity18 local authority to get involved			1
creating a stink : how former banker @entity14 's revolutionary dog waste system works the system converts canine excrement left in bins into bio-gas that can be used to power a turbine ( file picture ) the council is in final negotiations to adopt the revolutionary @entity30 system which could be rolled out as soon as july			1
councils spend £ 72.5million a year sending @entity5 's annual mountain of 700,000 tonnes of dog waste to landfill sites			1
in @entity37 , borough councils spend £ 9.5million annually on sending waste from the capital 's 800,000 dogs to landfill			1
but under the proposed green energy scheme some of that will be sent to digesters capable turning the waste into methane , co2 and fertiliser			0
@entity14 , who came up with the idea , aims to collect four tons a day of waste , which will be broken down by microorganisms and turned into power mr @entity14 , 42 , designed the self - contained system capable of powering up to 60 homes at a time			2
despite using animal faeces , mr @entity14 insists it is odour free and can operate on as little as 500kg of waste a day , generating 200,000 kilowatt hours of electricity a year			2
he said every tonne of excrement kept out of landfill will displace 450kg of greenhouse gases			0
he expects to make money by charging a fee to process the waste , along with income from @entity71 feed - in tariffs for its electricity			0
mr @entity14 told @entity73 : ' people already understand the ideas behind this and why it is necessary to do it so it is an easy step			0
mr @entity14 added : ' there has been a lot of interest and we 're talking to councils now in @entity18 , @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87			2
' mr @entity14 , who spent a decade working for @entity88 on the oil and gas markets , came up with the idea when he became fed up of pushing his baby 's pushchair along streets and parks covered in dog mess			1
his system uses anaerobic digestion - using micro-organisms to break down organic material in the absence of oxygen - to produce a mixture of methane and @entity47			0
the system will remove the waste from plastic bags used to pick it up using an automated system and then pass it through to a digester tank			0
the bio-gas will then be used to power a turbine generating electricity , while the heat and @entity47 will be fed into an adjoining commercial greenhouse to grow plants with the help of a pasteurised bio-fertiliser resulting from the remains of the waste			0
mr @entity14 added : ' we 're going to grow @entity122 trees , which can be donated to schools each year and then returned to the greenhouse so they can grow up with the child			0

the green power system is already being dubbed ' @entity3 '
it is the brainchild of @entity14 , a former banker now living in @entity16
@entity5 's deals with an annual mountain of 700,000 tonnes of dog mess
councils spend £ 72.5million a year sending it to landfill
