a horse , a dog , a flock of seagulls and a box of eggs			1
not the start of a bad joke , but some of the highlights – and surprises – of campaigning to maintain @entity10 within the @entity11			1
i always knew the independence referendum would be the most important event i would ever be involved in , the most important event for @entity10			1
because of that i decided to campaign in a totally different way , going back to an old - fashioned politics predating social media and spin doctors			1
i embarked on a 100 - stop tour of open - air meetings across my beautiful country			1
it was just me , my microphone , my makeshift stage of two @entity25 crates and whoever turned up			1
thousands of @entity10 came along and joined the great debate			2
i visited places i ’d never been to before and discovered that the best comedians are n’t only found at the @entity38			2
many were in the crowds with a wry comment or a well - timed put - down			2
i ’m not sure i got the better of every exchange			2
from @entity45 to @entity46 , it was n’t just undecided voters that got involved			2
on the island of @entity50 i was heckled by a horse wearing a @entity53 blanket			2
in @entity54 i was barked at by a dog with ‘ freedom ’ scrawled across its back			1
his purple - bearded owner claimed to be called @entity60 , and spent most of the meeting trying to climb on my crates bellowing ‘ traitor ! ’ in my right ear			1
one meeting in @entity67 harbour was disrupted by uninvited visitors			2
when i arrived the crowd had their hoods up			2
surprisingly , some even had umbrellas above their heads on a lovely rain - free evening			2
a journalist had to explain that the @entity53 voter at the edge of the crowd was the ‘ @entity79 ’ , who had summoned dozens of gulls over us to disrupt our gathering with droppings , but we just kept going ! there was a lighthearted edge to many of the criticisms – hecklers helped make many of the meetings more authentic			1
@entity29 , right , faced groups of organised @entity53 protesters anytime he tried to take to his stump however sometimes it became far more sinister			1
there is a dark corner of @entity10 where an intolerant @entity10 nationalism lives			2
we all know that no political movement is without its idiots			0
but what went on at times in the referendum was of a different nature altogether – it was n’t the occasional fool but an orchestrated campaign			1
in places like @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 , @entity53 groups organised big crowds of their followers to drown out our events , preventing undecided voters from joining open - air democracy			0
in their dozens and sometimes in their hundreds they screamed ‘ traitor ! ’ , ‘ scum ! ’ , ‘ @entity121 ! ’ and even ‘ terrorist ’			0
and there was one more vile insult they hurled at me			0
in the midst of the campaign , new details appeared in the media about alleged 1970s child abuse in and around @entity132			0
to some of my opponents , it did n’t matter that i was in primary school when these terrible cases were alleged to have taken place			0
instead it became a regular insult to scream ‘ @entity142 ! ’ at me throughout my street meetings			1
an anti-english group , @entity144 – or ‘ seed of the @entity146 ’ – boasted that they had been ‘ following @entity29 ’ for ‘ in - your - face confrontations ’			1
and there was a lot of publicity for the least - skilled egg thrower – it took him four eggs before he hit me			0
but i could n’t care less about an egg thrower , what was worrying was their determination to deny us space in @entity10 ’s streets			0
mr @entity29 , pictured , said party leader @entity162 also faced abuse while on the campaign trail and it was n’t just me ; @entity162 and others were also in their sights , and the @entity170 ’s @entity169 hq was targeted by @entity53 protesters because of unfounded allegations of anti-independence bias at the @entity170			1
i know the vast majority of @entity53 supporters would never dream of behaving like this			0
they decided to support the @entity53 campaign because they believed it was best for their family and our country			1
they are decent and honest people , many of whom are hurting this weekend			0
but wherever we went there was often a noisy crowd that followed us			0
rightly , nothing like this ever happened to @entity194 or the @entity53 campaign			0
after a while my meetings became impossible places to guarantee public safety – i had to halt my tour and seek police advice			1
to this day , i still do n’t know how high up in the @entity53 campaign these actions were sanctioned , but i do know how widespread they became			0
i lost count of how many no voters told me they were too worried to wear a sticker or display a poster			0
the effect was that visually , the @entity53 campaign appeared to speak for the majority			0
if the vote was decided by which campaign had the most window posters , then @entity10 would be independent			1
fortunately windows do n’t vote			1
but this phenomenon of passionate political silence gave me confidence that there was an undeclared pride in many people at being both @entity10 and @entity11			0
and @entity221 among others continually emphasised that referendum day was the time for ‘ the quiet patriotic majority to stand up and be counted ’			1
‘ @entity228 ’ was our campaign motto			0
but it has to be more than just a slogan			0
it ’s time to put the divisions of the campaign behind us and concentrate on what we have in common			0
in a dangerous and complicated world , the combined power , prosperity and influence of the four nations in our imperfect @entity241 is something to be cherished .			0

@entity29 said the referendum was the most important vote in his life
he said he wanted to go back to ' old fashioned ' politics with meetings
@entity29 travelled the country with a pair of @entity25 crates for his stump
