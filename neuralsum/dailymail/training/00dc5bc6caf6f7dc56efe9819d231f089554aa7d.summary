guest editor : musician @entity2 's today treated listeners to segments from radical journalist @entity4 and @entity6 founder @entity5 the @entity7 was under fire last night over claims that a celebrity edition of its flagship radio news programme had been dominated by ‘ left - wing claptrap ’			1
the today programme on @entity15 faced criticism from across the political spectrum after it gave editorial control to cult musician @entity2 , who filled the show with polemics from left - wing activists and bizarre musical interludes			2
radical journalist @entity4 was given air - time to attack @entity24 and @entity25 , and @entity6 founder @entity5 , who is wanted for sex offences in @entity27 , was hailed for his ‘ great courage ’ and given a @entity30 slot , in which he attacked @entity33 control			1
listeners were also subjected to a poem from an inmate of @entity37 and a rant against the @entity39			0
critics of the tone and content of the show included a former aide to @entity45 , the @entity7 ’s political editor and a @entity47 cabinet minister			1
@entity47 mps suggested the programme – one of a series produced under the guidance of ‘ guest editors ’ – may have breached the @entity7 ’s duty of political impartiality			1
@entity57 mp @entity56 , a former minister who served as a close aide to @entity45 , said yesterday ’s show was the worst he had heard in 30 years of listening			0
on @entity60 , he said : ‘ @entity61 , the @entity7 need a guest editor to continue today ’s balanced reporting of global affairs			1
@entity65 , @entity66 or @entity67 available tomorrow ? ’ welsh secretary @entity68 added : ‘ today ’s @entity72 programme is apparently the work of a “ guest editor ”			2
have to wonder who extended the invitation			0
’ @entity76 mp @entity75 said : ‘ the @entity7 has a duty to provide balanced factual report and analysis of the day ’s news – instead their flagship news and current affairs programme consisted of three hours of left - wing claptrap complete with conspiracy theories , monologues and folk music			1
’ public reaction to the show was divided , with some @entity60 users branding it ‘ left - wing tosh ’ , but others describing it as ‘ powerful and thought - provoking ’			1
one @entity60 said , ‘ what has @entity15 got for us tomorrow ? some sixth form @entity97 leftie reject ? pitiful drivel today			0
’ a comment left on the @entity102 ’s website – where many posters were supportive – read : ‘ @entity2 – what an utter embarrassment to the @entity7 and the @entity106			2
it was like giving editorship to an angry sixth - former , desperate to impart their ignorant and facile vituperations upon us all			0
’ appearances : radical journalist @entity4 was given air - time to attack @entity24 and @entity25 , and @entity6 founder @entity5 was hailed for his ‘ great courage ’ and given a @entity30 slot @entity7 political editor @entity116 weighed in , criticising mr @entity4 ’s suggestion that the corporation should not have broadcast tributes to @entity120 from mr @entity25 because he had failed to close @entity37 , or from mr @entity24 because he had visited @entity121 during the apartheid era			1
in a seven - minute diatribe against the ‘ criminal power of our government ’ , mr @entity4 also suggested the centuries - old conflict between @entity128 and @entity129 had been caused by the @entity106 and @entity131 invasion of @entity132 in 2003			0
on @entity60 , mr @entity116 said : ‘ @entity4 always thought - provoking but was he really suggesting that @entity7 ignore @entity25 ’s @entity120 grief as he is a hypocrite ? @entity136 massacres in @entity137 as @entity138 & @entity140 ’s fault ? surely , @entity4 , those are what we call opinions not facts ? ’ the decision to give free rein to @entity5 provoked particular anger			1
@entity47 mp @entity148 said it was extraordinary that the @entity6 founder , who is hiding from justice in the @entity153 embassy in @entity154 , was given an unchallenged platform for his views			0
' opinions not facts ' : @entity7 political editor @entity116 criticised mr @entity4 's segment on @entity60 , but admitted he was ' thought provoking ' in a special @entity30 slot , @entity5 said : ‘ to keep a person ignorant is to place them in a cage			1
and so it follows that the powerful – if they want to keep their power – will try to know as much about us as they can , and they will try to make sure that we know as little about them as is possible			0
’ mr @entity148 said : ‘ there was no attempt to put an opposing point of view – it was a breach of the @entity7 ’s duty to impartiality			1
it is not good enough for the @entity7 to say it is balanced because they have someone putting a right - wing point of view on another issue on another day			0
’ but @entity57 backbencher @entity180 said miss @entity181 should guest - edit the show ‘ every day ’			0
yesterday ’s show also featured a series of poetry readings by actor @entity186 , including one by @entity187 , the last @entity106 resident held in @entity37			0
a weather forecast was replaced by @entity190 ’s song @entity189 and there were several other musical interludes			0
miss @entity181 said she agreed to edit the programme only after extracting a promise from the @entity7 that contributors would be ‘ heard in a manner of their choosing , whether that be a monologue , a poem , or interviewing others ’			2
a @entity7 spokesman last night said the corporation had no plans to review its use of guest editors over the festive period , adding : ‘ the well - established role of the guest editors is to bring their own unique ideas and expertise to the today programme , working closely with the regular programme team to ensure the material meets the @entity7 ’s editorial guidelines			2
