by @entity0 @entity1 has patented a new method of tackling the problem of texting while driving by locking out drivers when their car is moving			1
the patent reveals a system using sensors and even onboard cameras to check if a person is in the driving seat			2
it even reveals a ' scenery analyser ' to tell if the driver is in a safe area			0
researchers from @entity23 recently found that using voice controls to send text messages while driving - on software including @entity1 's @entity19 - is just as dangerous as texting with fingers in april last year @entity28 researchers found that using voice commands to send text messages while driving - on software such as @entity1 's @entity19 - is just as dangerous as texting with fingers			1
they found that both methods impacted driver response times equally - but that it often took voice recognition users longer to fix mistakes with their messages			2
the findings were then confirmed by the @entity38 in the @entity39 in june			0
it similarly found that as mental workload and distractions increase , reaction times get slower and brain function is compromised			0
in the run up to the @entity17 release , @entity1 added eyes - free technology to its latest @entity49 software			1
the @entity51 - free tool lets users control this the system by voice so they can keep their eyes on the road			2
similar apps are already available for @entity60 devices while @entity62 ’s @entity61 comes with a specialized @entity63 aimed at ‘ reducing distractions while you ’re behind the wheel ’			0
@entity1 is also believed to be mulling adding the capabilities to its @entity69 software , saying it would be ' a significant selling point in the eyes of concerned parents , and it could lead to legislation that would require all handheld computing devices to disable texting while driving			0
' @entity1 announced its @entity49 in the car service earlier this year			0
called @entity17 , the integrated system gives drivers a ' smarter , safer and more fun way to use an @entity79 in the car			1
' it works by linking the car 's built - in display and software with @entity49 and @entity19 on the @entity79 , @entity81 and @entity82 - and will be rolled out to compatible @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88 later this week			1
once an @entity79 is connected to a vehicle fitted with @entity17 , @entity19 can be used to access the phone ’s contacts , make calls , return missed calls and listen to voicemails			0
when a user receives an incoming message or notification , they can reply using voice commands			0
@entity19 can also read the messages and let drivers dictate longer responses or emails			0
while driving , @entity17 can guess destinations by scanning the phone ’s calendar for appointments , and when used with @entity109 , @entity19 will give instructions , warn of any traffic incidents and keep the driver updated with the estimated time of arrival			2
drivers ' brainwaves were monitored while they talked on the phone and while voice - activated emails were played to them , in a system similar to that used in @entity1 's @entity17 , pictured			1
talking on a phone resulted in a moderate risk , but listening to voice - activated features was classed as an extensive risk elsewhere , @entity17 can be used to control music , podcasts and audiobooks on the car 's display , pictured , or by asking @entity19 to pull up what they 'd like to hear			1
@entity17 also works with select third - party apps such as @entity132 and @entity133 drivers can also ask @entity19 for turn - by - turn directions , which are shown on the car ’s built - in display			1
elsewhere , @entity17 can be used to control music , podcasts and audiobooks on the car ’s display , or by asking @entity19 to pull up what they ’d like to hear			1
@entity17 also works with select third - party apps such as @entity132 and @entity133			1
‘ @entity17 has been designed from the ground up to provide drivers with an incredible experience using their @entity79 in the car , ’ said @entity142 , @entity1 ’s vice president of @entity79 and @entity143			2
‘ @entity79 users always want their content at their fingertips and @entity17 lets drivers use their @entity79 in the car with minimised distraction			2
we have an amazing lineup of auto partners rolling out @entity17 , and we ’re thrilled it will make its debut this week			0
’ a leaked video , posted by app developer @entity158 at the end of january , hinted to what the technology would look like			0
@entity158 shared screenshots , like the one pictured , about what @entity17 might look like other car makers including @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity178 and @entity179 will be shipping @entity17 - compatible cars later this year			1

@entity158 shared a series of screenshots about what @entity17 might look like			0
@entity187 has also been in talks with car manufacturers , including @entity190 , to add a similar , @entity60 - based system into cars later this year .			1

integrated system works by linking a smart car 's display with an *iphone*
it will be rolled out to @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88 *customers*
other car makers including @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170 , and @entity171 will be shipping @entity17 - compatible cars later this year
patent will be able to tell when driver is moving - and lock them out
