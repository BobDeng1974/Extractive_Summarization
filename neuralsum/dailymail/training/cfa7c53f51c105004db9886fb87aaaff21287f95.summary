in a letter sent to president @entity15 shortly before left the @entity16 for the last time in her official capacity , @entity13 thanked her former foe for the 2008 @entity21 presidential nomination for the opportunity to serve in his administration			1
@entity13 said it had been an honor to be part of his cabinet			2
' i am more convinced than ever in the strength and staying power of @entity5 's global leadership and our capacity to be a force for good in the world , ’ she said in the letter			1
the former @entity58 senator and 2004 presidential candidate was sworn in friday by @entity61 @entity60 becoming the 68th secretary of state			1
' i 'm just very , very honored to be sworn in and i 'm very anxious to get to work , ' @entity10 told reporters after the private ceremony at the @entity66			1
' i 'll be reporting monday morning at 9 o'clock to do my part			0
' @entity10 told the @entity68 earlier on friday that he was president @entity15 ’s choice for secretary of state for some time , even as @entity73 ambassador @entity72 came under heavy fire as a possible nominee for the position			1
‘ he called me , actually a week before @entity72 got out of the thing , ’ said @entity10			2
‘ he called me and said , ‘ you ’re my choice			0
i want you to do this			0
’ he asked me to keep it quiet			0
’ @entity10 was sworn in at around 4pm est on friday as his predecessor ’s resignation became official			1
thanks : @entity13 thanked deputy secretary of state @entity86 as she addressed employees at the @entity16 for the final time as secretary of state touching moment : employees at the @entity16 gave an emotional goodbye to their former leader in the @entity16 's main lobby , @entity13 pushed through a throng of @entity5 foreign service workers who clamored for handshakes and smartphone photos with her and gave an emotional goodbye speech			1
she told them to continue to ‘ serve the nation we all love , to understand the challenges , the threats and the opportunities that the @entity5 faces and to work with all our heart and all of our might to make sure that @entity5 is secure , that our interests are promoted and our values are respected			2
’ @entity13 , however , also left office with a slap at critics of the @entity15 administration 's handling of the september attack on a @entity5 diplomatic mission in @entity120			1
she told @entity122 in an interview thursday that critics of the administration 's handling of the attack do n't live in an " evidence - based world , " and their refusal to " accept the facts " is unfortunate and regrettable for the political system			2
@entity13 told the @entity122 that the attack in @entity131 was the low point of her time as @entity5 's top diplomat			1
but she suggested that the furor over the assault would not affect whether she runs for president in 2016			0
although she insisted that she has not decided what her future holds , she said she ‘ absolutely ’ still plans to make a difference on issues she cares about in speeches and in a sequel to her 2003 memoir , ‘ @entity146 , ’ that will focus largely on her years as secretary of state			2
saying goodbye : @entity13 addressed employees at the @entity16 for the final time as secretary of state on february 1 , 2013 , in @entity150 big crowd : in the @entity16 's main lobby , @entity13 pushed through a throng of @entity5 foreign service workers who clamored for handshakes and smartphone photos with her and gave an emotional goodbye speech @entity13 spoke to the @entity122 thursday in her outer office on the seventh floor of the @entity16 less than 24 hours before she walks out for a final time as boss			1
she was relaxed but clearly perturbed by allegations from @entity169 lawmakers and commentators that the administration had intentionally misled the public about whether the attack was a protest gone awry or a terrorist attack , or intentionally withheld additional security for diplomatic personnel in @entity120 knowing that an attack could happen			0
an independent panel she convened to look into the incident was scathing in its criticism of the @entity16 and singled out four officials for serious management and leadership failures			0
but it also determined that there was no guarantee that extra personnel could have prevented the deaths of the @entity5 ambassador to @entity120 , @entity192 , and three other @entity5			2
@entity13 herself was not blamed , although she has said she accepted responsibility for the situation			2
‘ i was so unhappy with the way that some people refused to accept the facts , refused to accept the findings of an independent @entity200 , politicized everything about this terrible attack , ’ she said			0
‘ my job is to admit that we have to make improvements and we 're going to			0
’ low point : @entity13 said the day before her resignation that the attack in @entity131 was the low point of her time as @entity5 's top diplomat hours later a suicide bomber linked to a domestic terror group exploded a device just outside the @entity216 in @entity217 , @entity218 , killing himself and a guard			1
@entity13 told @entity16 staff on friday that the attack showed again how ‘ we live in very complex and dangerous times			1
’ @entity13 faced a barrage of hostile questions about @entity131 from @entity169 lawmakers when she testified before @entity227 recently in appearances that were delayed from december because of illness			2
afterward , some lawmakers continued to accuse her and the administration of withholding evidence			0
@entity234 senator @entity234 , of @entity235 , told a television interviewer that he thought @entity13 was getting ‘ away with murder			1
’ in the interview , @entity13 had little patience for such allegations			0
‘ there are some people in politics and in the press who ca n't be confused by the facts , ’ she said			0
‘ they just will not live in an evidence - based world			0
it 's regrettable for our political system and for the people who serve our government in very dangerous , difficult circumstances			0
’ because of that , she said , the partisan divide should not dissuade anyone with a cause from getting involved in politics , and she hinted strongly that a divisive atmosphere would not stop her in any future endeavor			0
‘ you have to have a thick skin because ( politics ) is just going to be a contact sport as far as we can look into the future			0
’ ' no decisions ' : ' i am making no decisions , but i would never give that advice to someone that i would n't take myself , ' @entity13 said about a potential run for president in 2016 @entity13 is no stranger to partisan politics			1
as first lady , she railed in 1998 against a ‘ vast right - wing conspiracy ’ that she asserted had been attacking her husband , @entity13 , ever since he had become president			1
but the woman who was once considered a divisive figure in @entity5 politics , yet leaves office as one of its most popular , remained coy about whether she would run for president in 2016			2
‘ i am making no decisions , but i would never give that advice to someone that i would n't take myself , ’ she said			0
‘ if you believe you can make a difference , not just in politics , in public service , in advocacy around all these important issues , then you have to be prepared to accept that you are not going to get 100 per cent approval			0
’ farewell : @entity13 waved as she left the @entity16 in @entity150 for last time as @entity5 's top diplomat			1

@entity3 formally resigned friday as @entity5 's 67th secretary of state on friday at 4 pm
' i am more convinced than ever in the strength and staying power of @entity5 's global leadership and our capacity to be a force for good in the world , ' @entity13 said in a letter to president @entity15 shortly before she resigned
