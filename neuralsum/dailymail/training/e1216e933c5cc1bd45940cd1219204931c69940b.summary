by @entity0 published : 18:16 est , 11 january 2014 updated : 06:14 est , 12 january 2014 ' if a student performs very strongly in most criteria , but their work contains grammatical errors , a first should be awarded , ' @entity7 's dr @entity6 a top university has been accused of leaning on academics to give students more top degrees - boosting its ranking in league tables against competitors			1
an internal document from the @entity7 - which charges fees of Â £ 9,000 a year - states : ' to put it bluntly , too few students are being awarded 2:1s and firsts			1
' dr @entity6 , academic director of taught programmes , adds the university 's ' @entity23 statistics fall behind those of its close competitors ' partly because the ' marking culture ' was characterised by ' conservatism ' and ' timidity '			1
he argues that basic grammatical errors should not kill off a chance of a top grade			1
the report - the basis for new marking guidance introduced last summer - was obtained by @entity36 under the @entity37			0
in the 2012 document , dr @entity6 said some academics had an ' odd ' view of a first and seemed to think that students should be ' verging on genius ' to be awarded one			1
he went on to criticise the approach of academics ' who argued that small grammatical errors should preclude the award of a first class mark ' and said that this would particularly disadvantage international students with weak @entity53			1
' if a student performs very strongly in most of the criteria , but their work contains grammatical errors , a first mark can and should be awarded , ' he instructed			1
he added : ' this is n't about ' dumbing down ' - far from it			0
rather , it is about rewarding excellent work with high marks - and giving credit where credit is due			0
' the document will fuel criticism that universities are undermining the credibility of degrees so they can push themselves up the results league tables - a key tool to market themselves to students			2
the revelation comes after the number of firsts and 2:1s gained by @entity80 students has hit record levels , with universities saying the trend reflects better teaching and the higher a-level grades of entrants			2
university students on campus at the @entity7 ( @entity7 ) , in @entity88 the proportion of firsts awarded by @entity7 in 2011/12 was 16 per cent , up from 11 per cent in 2006/7			1
in other evidence universities are putting pressure on staff , @entity91 discussed whether to assess academics on the marks they awarded to students			2
a memo said : ' the intention of this target is not to inflate grades unjustifiably but to ensure that levels of good degrees sit comfortably within subject benchmarks and against comparator institutions			0
' the plan was eventually dropped , however , after critics argued that it would compromise the academics ' ability to make objective assessments of students work			0
and at @entity116 , documents seen by this newspaper show a working group said there was ' a perceived reluctance ' in some departments ' to use the full range of marks and this may have had a knock - on impact on degree classification in particular in relation to firsts ... ' the group added that departments whose results fell below those at comparable universities were ' asked to consider this '			2
the new disclosures come as official figures to be published by the @entity137 this week are expected to show another rise in the proportion of graduates awarded top degrees			1
the proportion of firsts awarded by @entity7 in 2011/12 was 16 per cent , up from 11 per cent in 2006/7 prof @entity144 , of the @entity145 at @entity146 , said : ' the documents from @entity7 show evidence of deliberate dumbing down			1
it shows the university is giving out better degrees than students deserve			0
' universities seem to be in a race to give out as many good degrees as they can and are putting their academic staff under pressure to mark more leniently			0
they are in competition for students and their income depends on who they attract			0
many are doing this tacitly , but @entity7 has set it down in black and white			1
' but the pro-vice chancellor of @entity7 , professor @entity168 , said prof @entity144 's claims were ' unfounded ' , adding the new marking system was too new to have had any impact on results			2
he said : ' we totally refute the accusation of deliberate dumbing down			0
the claim that students are being awarded degrees they do n't deserve is utterly incorrect			0
the documents are part of regular good practice reviews			0
' @entity116 said : ' we strongly refute the suggestion that academic degree grades have been artificially inflated in recent years			0
