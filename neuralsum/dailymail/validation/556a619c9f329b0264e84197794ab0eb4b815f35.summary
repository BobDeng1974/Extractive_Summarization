@entity1 's @entity0 faces a completely different challenge as he looks to successfully defend a @entity4 title for the first time in his career in this week 's @entity7			1
@entity0 ended a four - year victory drought with his win 12 months ago at @entity10 at @entity11 , which , at 7,964 yards , was the longest course in @entity4 history			1
this year the tournament , which is the sixth and final event co-sanctioned with the @entity16 this season , has been switched to @entity18 , which measures 7,063 yards and has had the par - five fourth and 18th holes reduced to par fours , making it a par 70			1
@entity0 says it will be tough for him at the @entity7 this year but that he is looking forward to it the @entity1 plays a shot during a practice round at the @entity18 @entity0 poses with the trophy last year ' it 's a lot shorter and a lot more fiddly , ' said @entity0 of the course , which was redesigned in 2004 by @entity31 , who calls it a ' hidden gem '			1
' there will be a lot of positional play off the tee , a lot of irons and not many drivers			2
' it 's an adaptation that we have to make as players			2
we do n't generally play these types of golf courses			2
' it 's very different and i would prefer to be on a long golf course that 's quite tight , because driving is my strength			2
' it 's going to be different this week			0
your wedges will have to be sharp and you 're going to have to get a hot putter , because i can imagine the scoring will be pretty good with some quality players here this week			0
' i 'm looking forward to the challenge and hopefully the game can live up to that			1
' compatriot @entity60 missed the cut in the @entity62 last week but is looking for his third win in @entity64 in the space of 10 weeks , while home favourite @entity66 has the benefit of local knowledge			1
@entity70 has been a member of the club since he took up the sport and won his first tournament here at the age of 10			1
' i did n't build my game at this golf course , ' @entity66 said			0
' i putted well to shoot good scores here , but it 's a drawer 's golf course			0
there is a lot of risk and reward and on a lot of holes you can take it on			0
' there are some advantages to knowing the course as well as i do , but it suits a certain type of golfer			0
hopefully i make enough putts to make up for that			0
@entity60 is looking for his third win in @entity64 in the space of 10 weeks ' i guess there 's probably a little bit of extra pressure but hopefully i will thrive on it this week			1
' i 've got a couple of tricks that i know the course likes to throw at you and hopefully i 'll use them to my advantage			0
' compatriot @entity109 comes into the event on the back of winning his first @entity4 title at @entity113 last week , a win which proved highly popular			1
' it 's been overwhelming , ' @entity109 said			0
' all the messages and support , it 's something special			0
i 'm still busy soaking it in and looking forward to this week as well			2
