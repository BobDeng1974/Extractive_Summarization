a study found that people could bank and extra £ 18,425 during their working life if they abstained from cigarettes , alcohol , chocolate and coffee			1
experts say that if they invested this money well , by the time the retired they could have £ 74,612 in the bank			2
people could have an extra £ 75,000 by the time they retire if they gave up their bad habits during @entity5 however , the benefits are not just financial			1
the researchers at @entity18 say that average alcohol consumption just during @entity5 adds up to a total of 4,700 calories and that it would take 673 minutes of running to burn this off			1
they say that chocolate consumption during the same period adds up to an average of 8,100 calories			0
this means that anyone who is feeling very virtuous and who gives up both chocolate and alcohol during @entity5 could save themselves 12,804 calories a year			1
the researchers also say that during @entity5 people spend an average of £ 376 pounds on alcohol , cigarettes and chocolate			2
those who give up just smoking could save £ 220 a year while giving up alcohol would add another £ 78 of savings			2
if the average @entity41 gave up chocolate during @entity5 they would eat 8,100 fewer calories a year this figure for smoking is worked out on the basis that the average cigarette now costs 40p and the average smoker smokes about 12 cigarettes a day during the 46 days of @entity5			1
those who are partial to the occasional chocolate bar could have an extra £ 20 in their bank by the end of @entity5 each year if they give up the sweet stuff			1
this figure is worked out on the basis that the average @entity41 eats about three quarters of a chocolate bar a day			0
the researchers point out , also , that giving up chocolate can save people money in other ways			2
for example , eating too much chocolate can rot the teeth meaning giving it up could save people money on dental treatment			2

@entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , said : ‘ small sacrifices , even during the relatively brief 46 day period of @entity5 , can mean major savings – and these savings can be maximised if invested in appropriate ways , such as through an @entity85 rather than simply storing savings in a current account , especially at a time of low interest rates			0
‘ putting money to one side – even if it means making some sacrifices along the way – is becoming a necessity and , invested prudently , can reap rewards both now and in the future			0
’ commenting on the findings , dr @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity100 healthcare , said : ‘ in moderation , little treats – the occasional chocolate bar or a glass of wine – are a part of everyday life and can have a big effect on our happiness and frame of mind			0
people who give up smoking during @entity5 could save £ 220 a year while giving up alcohol would add another £ 78 of savings each year ‘ the flipside , however , is that over-indulgence can add up to a significant and detrimental impact on the body			1
‘ the dangers of cigarette smoking are well known and the ideal scenario for anyone ’s health is not to smoke at all , but giving up for @entity5 and proving to yourself that you can cope with not smoking for 46 days , is a fantastic start			0
‘ there are few of us who are not tempted by the seductive power of a chocolate bar			0
however , over-indulgence can lead to manifold health problems			0
‘ altogether , the average @entity138 adult will consume 12,804 calories from chocolate and alcohol during @entity5			0
cutting down or cutting out unhealthy habits for a 46 day period can make a difference and , better still , help give individuals confidence to stick with the positive changes they ’ve made and live a healthier lifestyle for the rest of the year			0
