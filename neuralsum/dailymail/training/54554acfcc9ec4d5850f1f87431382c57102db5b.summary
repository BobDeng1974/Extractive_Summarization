by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor married couples are in decline , fuelled by changes in social attitudes and the arrival of families from abroad			1
the proportion of families with a couple who have tied the knot fell from 70 per cent in 2001 to 65 per cent in 2011 , the @entity8 said			1
however , there are wide variations between the nationalities of families , with 85 per cent of @entity19 couples getting married compared to just 35 per cent of those from @entity21			1
while almost two thirds ( 65 per cent ) were married , the proportion with cohabiting couples and lone parent families rose in the decade from 2011			2
some 85 per cent of families were headed by someone born in the @entity37			0
but a breakdown based on the nationality of the ‘ family reference person ’ shows how rates of marriage , cohabiting and living alone vary depending on where in the world comes from			0
the @entity8 said that just over a third of foreign families were born in the @entity47 and @entity48 ( 36 per cent ) , with the two largest countries of birth ( @entity19 and @entity51 ) accounting for more than half ( 52 per cent ) from this region			1
among people born in the @entity37 , 65 per cent of couples were married , ranked 21 out of 35 countries			2
marriage rates were highest among families headed by someone born in @entity19 ( 85 per cent , followed by @entity59 ( 84 per cent ) and @entity60 ( 83 per cent )			1
the @entity8 said : ‘ high proportions of married couples may reflect cultural attitudes towards family structures and marriage in the population			1
’ ‘ high proportions of lone parent families may reflect reasons for migration ( such as conflict in the country of birth ) and arrival profiles ( as populations that have been i the @entity37 longer have had more time for partnership breakdown ) , ’ the @entity8 added			0
lone parent families accounted for 18 per cent of all families in @entity27 and @entity28 ; the proportion was highest for families headed by someone born in @entity21 ( 60 per cent )			0
the @entity8 said : ‘ this may reflect @entity21 - born migrants who arrived during the 1990s following the @entity21 civil war ; many women and children may have left without their partner			2
’ a third ( 33 per cent ) of @entity90 families were cohabiting , the highest rate in the country , followed by @entity93 ( 32 per cent ) and @entity94 and @entity95 , both on 30 per cent			0
just 3 per cent of families from @entity98 , @entity51 and @entity19 were cohabiting .			0
