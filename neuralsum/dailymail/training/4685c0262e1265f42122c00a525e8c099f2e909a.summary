changing 175 nappies and making up 80 bottles of milk each week is no easy task			2
but that ’s just the start of new mother @entity6 ’s to - do list			1
she gave birth to four babies in the space of nine months – despite fearing that she would never conceive			1
' at times it 's chaos ' , she said big brother ... only just ! freddie ( right ) with younger siblings @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 , who were born in march her son @entity13 was nine months old when she had triplets , now aged 19 weeks , in march			1
so it may not come as a surprise that the former care manager and her partner @entity28 , 31 , a postal worker , are exhausted			1
@entity29 : the couple have their hands decidedly full miss @entity6 , 29 , said : ‘ at times it feels more like running a nursery than a home , but we feel so blessed			1
‘ i was stunned when i found out i was pregnant again so soon			2
when we learned it was triplets we went into shock			2
‘ at times it ’s utter chaos but we just laugh and get stuck in			2
‘ it takes two hours to prepare to leave the house but we do n’t dwell on the hard work			2
i love babies so i feel like the luckiest mum in the world			2
’ miss @entity6 had tried to conceive for more than a year and was due to see a gp for tests when she became pregnant with @entity13			1
so after he was born in june last year , the couple did not use birth control			2
miss @entity6 said : ‘ we wanted to have at least two children			1
because it had taken so long with @entity13 , we assumed it would take the same time again , if not longer			1
’ in fact , @entity13 was only eight weeks old when she learned she was expecting			1
she said : ‘ i started shaking			0
i had barely recovered from having @entity13			1
i was still wearing maternity clothing			0
i was wondering how on earth i was going to cope			0
’ a scan at 12 weeks revealed miss @entity6 was expecting fraternal triplets			1
she said : ‘ the sonographer paused and asked if we knew how many babies we were having			0
our mouths fell open because we thought she was telling us it was twins			0
‘ when she said triplets i nearly fell off the bed in shock			2
neither of us could speak as she turned the screen to us and pointed out three little wriggling shapes			0
i just started crying when i realised they would be born before @entity13 was one			1
’ proud : miss @entity6 said : ' when she said triplets i nearly fell off the bed in shock			1
neither of us could speak as she turned the screen to us and pointed out three little wriggling shapes			0
i just started crying when i realised ' loving family : miss @entity6 with her partner @entity28 , 31 ( left ) and just before she gave birth to triplets ( right ) industrial operation : looking after the four babies involves changing 175 nappies and 80 milk bottles a week the couple , from @entity89 in south - east @entity90 , were warned the pregnancy was high risk and offered a selective termination – aborting one baby to give the other two a better chance			1
they decided against the procedure			0
what the family need to look after @entity15 , @entity17 and @entity16 : 80 bottles of milk 175 nappies 42 outfits at 33 weeks , one of the babies showed signs of distress , so surgeons at @entity108 , in @entity109 , had to perform an emergency caesarean section			1
@entity15 was born first weighing 3lb 12oz , followed by @entity17 , 4lb 7oz , and sister @entity16 , at 3lb 14oz			1
miss @entity6 said : ‘ i could n’t believe it when they kept passing over all these babies			1
when we saw all three side by side in their incubators it took my breath away			0
’ the triplets were finally allowed to come home last month			1
miss @entity6 said : ‘ it ’s like a tag team operation but we still find time for a cup of tea together when they first go to bed			1
‘ then it ’s back to the washing and laying out all the clothes and washing bottles for the next day			0
a quick walk to the shop can take hours , because so many people stop and ask me if they are all mine			0
they ca n’t believe it when i say yes			0
‘ but i love the fuss and attention they get			0
i once thought i could n’t have kids and then i got the perfect family in less than a year			0
’ mr @entity28 said : ‘ i wo n’t pretend it is n’t exhausting but it ’s lovely to see how close they all are already			1
‘ still , we wo n’t be trying for another any time soon			0
’ they 're a bit of a handful , but @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 are now 19 weeks old and full of energy miss @entity6 added : ' a quick walk to the shop can take hours , because so many people stop and ask me if they are all mine			1
they ca n’t believe it when i say yes			0
but i love the fuss and attention they get			0
i ’m so proud ' falling pregnant so soon after having a baby is highly unlikely as breastfeeding acts as a natural contraceptive			0
if a mother breastfeeds regularly , there is a high chance she will be temporarily infertile due to high levels of certain hormones such as progesterone			0
according to the @entity170 , breastfeeding is a natural contraceptive method and is 98 per cent effective if undertaken regularly but it only works if the mother breastfeeds every few hours including at night and only for the first six months of the baby ’s life			2
after this stage women are advised to use other forms of contraception			0
the method - known as ‘ lactational amenorrhea ’ - has been considered by doctors as an effective form of contraception since the 1990s			0
but in reality , very few women in the western world rely on it partly because they do not breastfeed intensively enough			0
nonetheless , it is still possible for women such as @entity6 to become pregnant so soon after giving birth particularly if they are not breastfeeding regularly .			2

@entity6 's son @entity13 was nine months old when she had triplets
she and partner @entity28 from @entity89 , @entity90 , were shocked at arrival
