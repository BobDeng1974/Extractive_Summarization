by @entity0 published : 05:30 est , 14 september 2012 updated : 19:27 est , 14 september 2012 ' rogue trader ' : former @entity3 banker @entity2 allegedly lost his bank £ 1.4 billion in @entity6 's biggest banking fraud a city trader who thought he had ‘ the magic touch ’ gambled away £ 1.4billion in @entity6 ’s biggest banking fraud , a court heard			1
@entity2 , 32 , is accused of acting as a ‘ master fraudster ’ to conceal the colossal losses he was making at the @entity14 bank @entity3			1
@entity15 heard how the former public school head boy was driven by ‘ greed and ego ’ on his reckless spree			1
his disastrous trades left a trail of ‘ chaos and disaster ’ landing the bank with losses of £ 1.4billion and wiping around £ 2.8billion off its share price			1
at one stage he faced losing @entity3 almost £ 7.4billion in unhedged investments			1
@entity29 , prosecuting , said : ‘ this is not a one off , heat - of - the - moment rogue trader carried away on a wave of euphoria			2
mr @entity2 was a gamble or two from destroying @entity14 ’s largest bank			2
’ she described him as ‘ a greedy banker , out of control and out for himself ’			0
jurors were told his losses would have been enough to pay a year ’s salary for almost 70,000 nurses , build two @entity43 stadiums or six hospitals			0
she said : ‘ mr @entity2 ’s motive was to increase his bonus , his status within the bank , his job prospects and of course his ego			1
like most gamblers , he believed he had the magic touch			0
‘ and like most gamblers , when he lost , he caused chaos and disaster to himself and all of those around him			0
’ @entity2 was described as a ‘ trusted and admired ’ member of his team who was rewarded with large bonuses for what his bosses thought were huge profits			1
but miss @entity64 said : ‘ mr @entity2 ’s greed got the better of him and he took advantage of the bank ’s trust to cheat the system for his own gain			2
’ by the time his ‘ pyramid of fraud ’ collapsed , @entity2 was ‘ throwing money wildly into the market hoping to dig himself out of the mess he had created ’			1
she said : ‘ in effect , mr @entity2 had ceased to act as a professional investment banker and had begun to approach his work as a naked gambler			1
he had become what is sometimes referred to as a rogue trader			0
mr @entity2 ’s activities were more deliberate than that of a mere rogue trader			1
' motive ' : a court heard @entity3 investment banker @entity2 hoped to boost his bonus and position within the company as well as ego allegations : @entity2 is accused of making unauthorised trades when he worked for @entity14 bank @entity3 in their @entity95 office ‘ he did not simply make a few wild bets			1
he faked bookings , created false accounts and conducted himself as a master fraudster , deliberately and systematically deceiving and defrauding the bank			0
’ miss @entity64 said @entity2 had ‘ fraudulently side - stepped ’ rules that banned high - risk investments , adding : ‘ he was lying to ... his senior managers , his risk - control department , and the accounts department			1
‘ in effect he was risking the very existence of the bank by gambling its resources , ultimately for his own benefit			0
’ @entity2 worked in the global synthetic equities division of @entity3 , where his career ‘ progressed at great speed ’			1
his salary soared from £ 50,000 with a £ 15,000 bonus in 2008 to £ 110,000 with a £ 250,000 bonus in 2010			2
on trial : @entity2 , centre , arrives at @entity15 where he is accused of the biggest bank fraud in @entity6 history , flanked by his lawyers handcuffed : @entity2 , 32 , is accused of two counts of fraud and two counts false accounting over the course of two years while working at @entity3 miss @entity64 said his income rose not because he was a top trader but because , as he later admitted , it was during this period that he began to fraudulently gamble the bank ’s money ... to maximise his bonus and enhance his reputation as a top trader ’			1
but on september 14 last year , his trades were challenged by @entity3 accountant @entity137			2
after speaking to mr @entity137 , @entity2 left his office that afternoon pretending to go to a doctor ’s appointment			2
instead , miss @entity64 said he sent mr @entity137 a ‘ bombshell email ’ in which he owned up			0
he was arrested the next day			0
in the email , which was read to the court , he said : ‘ @entity145 , it is with great stress that i write this mail , ’ before going on to describe how @entity2 had hidden losses through other trades that initially made a profit before losing more and more			1
risking it all : @entity15 heard @entity2 stopped behaving like an investment banker and fell into a gambling mindset he signed off : ‘ i take full responsibility for my actions and the s * * * storm that will now ensue			1
i am deeply sorry to have left this mess for everyone and to have put my bank and my colleagues at risk			0
’ miss @entity64 said : ‘ in the email , mr @entity2 clearly admits that , one – he fabricated deals ; two – that he invented non-existent clients ; three – that he broke the rules ; four – that he lied to the supervisor ; and five – he hoodwinked colleagues			1
‘ on september 14 , his system crashed like a car hitting a wall at high speed			0
he was left with no choice but to admit exactly what he had been up to			0
’ the court was told @entity2 will claim he was not acting dishonestly and that colleagues knew what he had been doing			2
he denies two counts of fraud and two counts of false accounting			1
the court heard @entity2 eventually had to own up to what he had been doing and sent this email to chartered accountant @entity137 : ' @entity145 , it is with great stress that i write this mail			2
first of all the @entity189 ( @entity189 ) trades that you see on the ledger are not trades that i have done with a counterparty as i previously @entity193 used the bookings as a way to suppress the @entity197 losses that i have accrued through off - book trades that i made			2
those trades were previously profit making , became loss making as the market sold off aggressively through the aggressive sell - off days of july and early @entity203 , i had been short futures through june and those lost money when the first @entity207 confidence vote went through in mid-june			0
in order to try and make the money back i flipped the trade long through the @entity211 i had a couple of opportunities to unwind the long trade for a negligible loss , i did not move quickly enough for the market weakness on the back of the first back macro data and then an escalation @entity220 crisis cost me the losses you will see when the etf bookings are cancelled			0
the aim had been to try and make the money back before the september expiry date came through but i clearly @entity228 are still live trades on the book that will need to be unwound			0
namely a short position in @entity233 futures [ which had been rolled to december expiry ] and a short position in @entity236 and p 500 futures that are due to expire on @entity238 have now left the office for the sake of discretion			0
i will need to come back in to discuss the positions and explain face to face , but for reasons that are obvious , i did not think it wise to stay on the desk this @entity247 will expect that questions will be asked as to why nobody else was aware of these @entity251 reality is that i have always maintained that these were @entity253 trades to the member of my team , @entity256 , trade support and @entity258 ( @entity2 's manager )			2
i take full responsibility for my actions and the s * * * storm that will now ensue			0
i am deeply sorry to have left this mess for everyone and to have put my bank and my colleagues at @entity266 , @entity2			0
' sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
