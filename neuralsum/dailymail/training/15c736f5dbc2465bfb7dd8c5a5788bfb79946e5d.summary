@entity0 gave up alcohol for the experiment a few cups of coffee , an evening glass of wine , and saying yes to dessert – can these everyday pleasures be considered vices ? increasingly , doctors suggest we would be healthier if we did n’t indulge so regularly			1
new @entity13 guidelines announced last month suggest that those who drink just a couple of large glasses of wine a night should be offered drug addiction medication to help them break the habit			1
there is also a concerted push to reduce our sugar consumption , and coffee has been strongly linked to the rising incidence of anxiety disorders , which now affect one in 20 of the population			1
@entity28 , the @entity29 lead at @entity30 , says that even short breaks from such common vices will yield health benefits and could break the cycle of regarding so - called treats such as chocolate , wine and coffee as rewards			1
‘ these may seem like harmless things to help get you through the day or a reward in the evening , but we do n’t realise just how much damage they are doing to our bodies in the long term			1
’ he adds : ‘ giving up some of these common vices , even for just a few months , can make a big difference to your health , as our experiment shows			1
‘ it ’s easier said than done for most of us and it ’s only when you try to give them up that you realise they are very real addictions			1
‘ as with our three guinea pigs , what can often happen is that one addictive substance is replaced with another			1
‘ of course , to see long - term benefits you have to sustain that good work and keep motivated			2
our volunteers underwent a battery of health checks as part of a @entity30 advanced assessment ( bmihealthcare.co.uk ) which measured their weight , blood pressure , body fat percentage , blood glucose levels , and waist / height ratio			1
they then gave up their chosen ‘ vice ’ for three months			2
each was offered sessions of cognitive behaviour therapy ( @entity75 ) , a psychological treatment recommended by the @entity13 to help support addicts , but encouraged to make no other changes to their lifestyle			1
at the end of the experiment , they were tested again			1
their results were analysed by nutritional therapist @entity84 ( well - well - well			2
co.uk ) and personal trainer @entity86			2
‘ that can be a real challenge and sticking to everything in moderation may be a more sustainable lifestyle change			2
’ i 'm back in control and looking much better @entity0 , who is in her 40s , is single and lives in @entity95			1
she says : ‘ in recent years i ’ve found myself drinking more			2
at first it was to help ease the stress of the day , but it became a habit as my nightly tipple increased to two or three glasses			2
‘ i wanted to feel in control once more , and it was surprisingly easy for the first four days			2
but after that i started to crave a large glass of chilled white wine			2
i stayed home in the evenings to avoid temptation			2
‘ by week two the sight of someone drinking on tv or just reading about it in a book brought on the thirst			2
i drank coconut water by the litre			2
when i ventured out , i stuck valiantly to mineral water			2
for a treat i drank spicy @entity119 , but i yearned for alcohol			1
‘ i chose not to have @entity75 – i prefer to be left to my own devices			2
the end of week three left me feeling more comfortable , but envy still hit me in a social settings where others were drinking			2
at home , quality chocolates were my late - night replacement			2
‘ after six weeks , during which i thought of drinking at least once a day , friends and colleagues started to point out that my eyes were clearer , my face was less puffy , and that i had lost weight			2
i realised i was feeling more energetic			2
it was vanity that made me continue because i can not say that it got any easier			0
clearly my addiction had deep roots			0
it ’s six weeks since i started drinking again and i have reset the valve			0
when i have alcohol , it ’s for the taste , not the effect			1
i am once again in control			0
’ verdict writer @entity148 gave up sugar for three months @entity84 says : ‘ the @entity13 is planning to offer women who drink five units of alcohol a day – that ’s a couple of large glasses of wine – addiction medication to reduce the numbers of patients with an alcohol - related illness			1
many middle - class professionals think drinking this much is pretty normal			0
the advantages from reducing intake , besides reducing the risk of heart and liver disease , diabetes and stroke , is it will make a rapid difference to your shape – as @entity0 has discovered			1
she would have seen even more progress if she had n’t drunk so much coconut water because a litre contains the equivalent of 12 teaspoons of sugar			1
’ @entity86 says : ‘ her already high levels of cholesterol have increased , and i ’d suggest warrant medical investigation – perhaps she turned to comfort foods high in saturated fats , but there could be an underlying genetic cause			0
even if she did need medication , her numbers could be lowered with the correct food choices in combination with regular exercise			0
’ i went sugar - free ... and dropped two trouser sizes @entity148 , 42 , is single and lives in @entity192			1
he says : ‘ how hard can it be to quit sugar ? the answer is it ’s incredibly difficult			1
@entity196 is in everything , from the obvious cakes and biscuits to shop - bought soups			0
on the first day i left the shop with just asparagus and cheese			0
@entity205 and after dinner was when my sweet cravings were worse and i had to fight the urge for a bar of chocolate			0
i had headaches and felt lethargic – i just did n’t think sugar had that kind of power			1
‘ @entity75 helped me break the pattern of rewarding myself with sweet snacks , but the main motivator was mathematical – i learned to work out how much added sugar is in food and picture it as teaspoons			1
going to the pub was fine – red wine is naturally low in sugar			1
but i avoided eating out as i could n’t face opting for a salad			0
‘ going sugar - free meant a more traditional meat - and - veg diet			1
i lost 7lb in ten days			0
at the end of the experiment i bought a cake and a @entity230 takeaway , but did n’t touch either			1
my tastebuds have changed – even sliced bread is too sweet			0
i am almost two trouser sizes smaller and feel so much better			0
’ verdict @entity235 gave up caffeine for the experiment @entity84 says : ‘ @entity148 has done himself huge favours as his waist was heading towards 35in , the size linked to development of diabetes			1
his blood pressure has improved dramatically – the body breaks down sugar and converts it into energy and this may increase the heart rate if consumption is excessive			1
‘ @entity196 can build up in the liver , impairing function – so that ’s why this reading improved			0
‘ the rise in cholesterol might be down to the cheese – he needs to ensure his diet is rich in soluble fibre which binds to and excretes cholesterol in the gut			0
he should also aim to increase essential fats from foods such as oily fish and nuts			0
’ @entity86 says : sugar and white foods such as chips and buns are addictive			1
people use sweet treats to make themselves feel better emotionally			1
the fast - release energy they provide ca n’t all be utilised by a typically sedentary person with a desk job , so it ’s stored as fat			0
once you wean your tastebuds away from sweet things , it ’s easy to break the bond			0
hopefully the huge positives @entity148 has experienced will help keep him from relapsing			1
’ quitting coffee left me calmer - but fatter @entity235 , 36 , lives in @entity95 with her husband @entity148 and two children			1
she says : ‘ i knew i was a caffeine addict , drinking four coffees , three cups of tea and two cans of sugar - free cola a day to cope with the demands of being a working mother			1
but reading reports linking the drug – yes , it is – to anxiety rang so very true			0
i also suffered constant headaches			0
‘ the first week was hellish : i was light - headed , irritable and overcome by waves of tiredness			0
@entity75 sessions helped remind me that these side effects were normal			0
after that my headaches stopped and i slept better overnight			0
i felt less anxious and my moods were much more even			0
‘ but i felt flat			0
there was nothing to look forward to in the mornings			0
decaf tea tasted like fish and herbal tea was unsatisfying			0
instead of espressos i ’d resort to the biscuit barrel or chocolate to perk me up			0
my evening cola was replaced with a couple of glasses of wine			0
my weight crept up as a result			0
within a week of the experiment ending , i was back to two cups of tea and cup of coffee a day			1
i ’ve decided caffeine is one drug that can be enjoyed in moderation			1
’ verdict @entity84 says : ‘ caffeine is a stimulant and @entity330 was consuming to excess – 400mg a day is the upper recommended limit and she was downing more than twice this , which was exacerbating her anxiety			1
the drop in blood pressure is a result of her giving up			0
it ’s typical that she substituted it with another stimulant : sugar			1
rehab clinics ban sweets because drug addicts often gorge on sugary snacks when their primary vice is removed , and she ’s lucky she did n’t put on even more weight			0
i suspect she is n’t eating a balanced diet with enough complex carbohydrates to sustain her energy levels			0
’ @entity86 says : ‘ all that caffeine was being processed by the liver , which also regulates cholesterol levels			1
now that the organ can focus on its primary job , her levels have fallen too			0
but i suspect she ’ll slip back into her old ways if she does n’t tackle the issues driving her problem			0

@entity0 , @entity148 and @entity235 all took part in experiment
underwent battery of health checks before and after three month period
all three noticed huge positive differences to appearance and behaviour
@entity13 is urging people to cut down on caffeine , sugar and alcohol
