he is the latest object of female lust from @entity2 to @entity3 — a heartbroken hero who is all brooding desire and smouldering good looks			1
and @entity7 , the new @entity8 , certainly has plenty of tumultuous romantic experiences to draw on			1
perhaps , given his good looks , a rather swashbuckling love life is to be expected : gossips in @entity13 insist that he was once — when between serious girlfriends — seen leaving a nightclub in the city with no fewer than three attentive females in tow			1
his first girlfriend was actress @entity29 , a pretty blonde whom he met in 2004 while at drama school in @entity13			1
she was followed by another actress , brunette @entity33			1
they lived together in @entity35 , @entity36 , from 2007 to 2009			2
she told an interviewer how happy they were together			2
but within a few weeks they split , and she was apparently devastated			2
@entity7 then fell for @entity41 , his co-star in the tv series @entity43 — from 2009 he played a vampire and she a ghost			1
then in 2011 , he and @entity41 parted ways and he decided to quit the series while she stayed on			1
it seems that this was a source of great heartbreak for him			2
he said this week : ‘ i do n’t know anyone on this planet who has n’t had their heart broken			2
it ’s happened to me			2
love is love , it ’s the purest and rawest thing we have in life			1
’ @entity7 was also romantically involved with @entity33 ( pictured )			1
they shared a flat together in @entity35 , @entity36 from 2007 to 2009 the following year he started to date the @entity65 actress @entity21			2
she was nominated for a @entity66 for her performance on @entity68 opposite @entity69 in @entity70 , and last year starred in the film @entity22 with @entity23			2
their romance is still going strong after three years , but @entity7 admits that they are often separated by work			1
he spent 18 months making @entity77 films in @entity78 early on in their liaison			2
he explained of the periods of separation : ‘ it ’s all we ’ve ever known [ as a couple ] and it makes for good times when we meet up again and maybe have a month straight when we ’re both unemployed and watching movies every day			1
it ’s fun to laze around and do normal things			2
’ @entity7 ( left ) also dated @entity41 ( right ) from 2009 to 2011 , after they met on the tv series @entity43			1
he later decided to quit the series while she stayed on @entity7 is quietly bowled over by his sudden fame			1
asked how it feels to be an overnight sex symbol , he chuckles			2
‘ ah , i would n’t say that , ’ he demurred yesterday			2
but it is nice that the show has gone down quite well and people are positive about it			2
’ understatement must be as much a part of his make - up as the kind of looks which have reduced the female half of the country to jelly			0
in the show , @entity7 is @entity113 officer @entity8 , who returns to @entity3 following the @entity114 to find his father dead , the family ’s tin mine in ruins and his sweetheart , @entity111 , engaged to his cousin			1
@entity7 ( left ) is seen with ex-girlfriend actress @entity29 ( right ) whom he met in 2004 while at drama school in @entity13 since the opening episode on sunday , there has been praise for the ensemble acting and the script — but mostly for how dishy the lead looks in a pair of britches			1
even his mother , @entity128 , is being stopped in the street and asked how it feels to have a sex - symbol son			0
‘ that is very funny , ’ @entity7 told me this week			1
‘ i ’ve definitely never had that before			0
i ca n’t believe it , really			0
’ i can reveal that @entity7 is contracted to be in a further five series of @entity136 , should the @entity137 make the obvious decision to make more			1
in the meantime , he is staying with his mum in @entity13 , although he is hoping to go away on holiday soon with girlfriend @entity21			0
@entity7 ( pictured as @entity8 ) has been bowled over by his sudden rise to fame and definitely does n't consider himself a sex symbol one of those watching @entity136 on sunday was his old drama teacher @entity147 , director of @entity13 ’s @entity148 , who told me : ‘ i settled down in front of the telly like a child waiting to meet @entity154			1
and then he comes on , all brooding and bubbling and seething , and i said to myself : “ well , that ’s a grand day out			0
” i could not be prouder of him			0
’ mr @entity147 , who counts @entity160 star @entity159 among his previous students , puts @entity7 ’s success down to talent , hard work and good manners — all three of which @entity148 students are taught			1
the son of @entity128 , an accountant at a local carpet store , and @entity172 , an electrician , there is no acting background in @entity7 ’s family — he had n’t even been to a play before he went to drama college			1
he was raised in @entity177 , just west of @entity13 , and went to @entity179 ’s @entity178 in @entity180			0
one of two brothers , he recalls having been a bit of a tearaway as a schoolboy			0
he told one interviewer : ‘ i remember my mum getting called up a lot			0
’ smouldering : @entity188 with co-star @entity189 in @entity136 dumped : in the @entity137 series , @entity136 ( @entity7 ) is dumped by his former love @entity111 ( @entity191 ) his great talent at that age was ballroom dancing , and he even represented his country			1
he travelled around @entity65 and internationally , competing in ballroom and @entity197 for around ten years			0
@entity198 , president of @entity199 of @entity65 , told me : ‘ i used to teach @entity7			1
but after i told his mother the cost of making it in international ballroom dancing , she said they could n’t afford it and told me that he might go into acting			0
‘ this surprised me as he was very shy			0
anyway , he joined the @entity148 and the rest is history			0
’ while at drama school , he did put his old skills to use , doing a dance for a fundraiser with his then girlfriend @entity29			0
@entity7 had no idea what he wanted to do after school			1
after a stint working with his dad as an apprentice , he toyed with the idea of becoming a professional snooker player before spotted an advert for the @entity148			0
‘ i did n’t know anything about this world at all , ’ said @entity7			1
‘ i felt intimidated from the get - go , but thought : “ that ’s just right for me			0
” the sense of potential failure is a buzz			0
‘ being around committed people there was very inspiring			0
’ before he started acting , @entity7 ( pictured with @entity189 in @entity136 ) , represented @entity65 in ballroom dancing competitions across the country and internationally he graduated in 2004 , and had various theatre roles before getting a break in an @entity65 television medical drama , @entity240 , in 2008			1
the following year came @entity43			0
this attracted an excitable group of young fans whom he calls ‘ the posse ’ , and who have followed his every move ever since			0
he gained more fans playing @entity248 , a heartthrob of the dwarf world in @entity252 ’s @entity77 films			0
but his biggest break was poldark			0
earlier this year he said : ‘ the offer came in and i said : “ what the hell ’s @entity136 ? ” i had to @entity256 it			0
‘ then i called my mum			0
she said : “ you ’d better not mess this up ! ” ’ do n't mess this up ! @entity7 had n't heard of @entity136 but was warned not to mess the job up by his mother perhaps we can forgive his ignorance as , since he ’s still only 31 , he was n’t even born when the original @entity270 tv version aired			1
one wonders if either he or girlfriend @entity21 are ready for the attention which has just exploded , even more of which will no doubt follow with the promise of a buff and shirtless @entity136 in future episodes			0
@entity21 said in an interview last year that she had been outraged when some fans took pictures of him when he was asleep on the @entity281			0
but he says of the ardent kerfuffle : ‘ i do n’t think she ’ll be bothered , no. we ’re both actors , we understand that it is part of our job			0
’ in @entity7 ’s case , the ‘ job ’ seems to be the play the role of newly minted national sex symbol — and he ’s doing it to perfection .			1

@entity7 plays @entity8 in a @entity137 remake of the @entity270 series
he **'s** become the nation **'s** latest object of desire thanks to his good looks
it seems the *hearthrob* has also had a rather swashbuckling love life
