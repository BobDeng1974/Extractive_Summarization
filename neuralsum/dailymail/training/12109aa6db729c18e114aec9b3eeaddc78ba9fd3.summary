by @entity0 for the @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 @entity3 will not search for stars if @entity5 reach @entity6 2015 as he vowed to stick with the players who are on the brink of qualification			1
@entity5 , who have already won @entity11 , face fixtures tonight in @entity13 and @entity14 next tuesday before they discover in seven days which country they must beat over two legs in october to secure a trip to the @entity19			1
but if they fulfil that aim , @entity3 has made it clear he will not look to draft in players such @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 to boost @entity5 ’s chances , even though they are all eligible			1
warning : @entity3 has told young @entity5 hopefuls they must show commitment to his project ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity32 : @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 : @entity37 , @entity38 : @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 : @entity42			1
former under - 21 head coach @entity43 used to clash with the @entity44 over not being able to select the best available players and often used the example of @entity47 , who picked @entity50 winners @entity48 and @entity51 when they won the 2011 tournament in @entity53			0
@entity3 , however , does not feel there would be any benefits – either for the players or his team – by naming those who have graduated			2
@entity27 , for instance , played in three of @entity3 ’s first five games but is now one of the first names on @entity63 ’s team sheet			1
i can tell you now that is n't even in my thinking , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ @entity26 , for example , has been to two major championships			2
i know people cite @entity47 , with @entity48 and a couple of others			0
but this is fairly typical of must under 21 coaches around @entity77			0
‘ @entity78 still qualifies to play for @entity53 but i do n't see the @entity79 clamouring for him ( to be involved with the @entity80 )			0
you need to see what can be gained by bringing them back into this environment			0
senior step - up : @entity27 has become a starter for @entity5 and is seen as the future of the side no go : @entity3 has confirmed players such as @entity26 wo n't play for the @entity80 21s leading the attack : @entity94 striker @entity42 celebrates scoring for @entity80 21s ‘ my job is like that of a reserve team manager at a club - you have got to adapt and adjust to the players you have got available			1
@entity63 wants to play younger players , so they are going to gain international experience			0
’ the standard of opposition @entity5 face over the next five days , starting here in @entity107 , will have no relation to what will be in store next month but @entity3 is not concerned they will be found wanting after their educational trip to @entity114 this summer			1
‘ we went there so the players could recognise the level that is needed and the experiences they are going to face , ’ said @entity3			2
‘ very few of the countries ( who will be in the play - offs ) are going to face a really top side prepare them for next month			2
there are going to be seven or eight top nations in the draw but you do n’t know who will be strong			0
for all we know , @entity130 could be stronger than @entity47			0
it is difficult to tell with age groups but i do n't think we are short of talent			0

@entity3 *'s* side have already secured top spot in their group
@entity5 will face a two leg *contest* in october to secure a trip to @entity6
senior stars eligible such as @entity24 , @entity26 , @entity25 and @entity27 wo n't be selected if @entity5 qualify
@entity146 and @entity147 also played in senior win against @entity149
