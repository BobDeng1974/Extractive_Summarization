by @entity0 published : 07:04 est , 15 july 2013 updated : 09:09 est , 15 july 2013 a schoolgirl has beaten the odds to walk again after being paralysed by a tick bite			2
@entity4 , 10 , developed @entity5 ( tm ) two years ago leaving her paralysed from the chest down and seeing four of everything			1
she was told there was a 70 per cent chance she would never return to full health , but after a gruelling physiotherapy programme has made a full recovery			1
@entity4 , 10 , developed the neurological condition @entity5 ( tm ) two years ago leaving her paralysed from the chest down and seeing four of everything @entity4 ’s parents @entity16 and @entity18 say that her condition began to quickly deteriorate after she was bitten by a tick while on a family holiday on the west coast of @entity23			1
she was diagnosed with @entity5 which is a disorder that attacks on the central nervous system and affects just 300 people a year			1
doctors said she would be fine , but in october 2011 her health worsened to the point where she could n’t even tolerate light			2
mrs @entity4 said : ‘ @entity4 could n’t go to the bathroom			1
she stopped being able to move her legs and she was in a lot of pain			0
‘ her eyes were crossed			0
she said , “ @entity37 , i do n’t know which mummy is you			0
i can see four mummies ”			0
’ @entity4 , who lives in @entity41 , was rushed to @entity42			1
at first , doctors thought she had meningitis , but after the results came back negative , @entity4 was sent for an mri which confirmed she had developed @entity5			1
@entity4 ( pictured with her mother , @entity16 ) was told there was only a 30 per cent chance of her making a full recovery but after months of physiotherapy she has returned to full health doctors treated her with high doses of steroids , but they were not sure how much damage had been done and warned her parents that she may never walk again			1
her mother said : ‘ we were told that a third of children with @entity5 will make a full recovery , a third will make a partial recovery and the other third will make no recovery at all			1
’ @entity5 is a rare neurological disorder which results in inflammation of the central nervous system			1
it can be caused by abnormal activation of the immune system against the spinal cord but it often develops alongside other infections			0
symptoms depend on where the spinal cord is affected and on the severity of the damage caused to the myelin and the neurons in the spinal cord			0
symptoms include muscle weakness , paralysis , fatigue , depression , fever , headache and incontinence			0
there are about 300 cases a year in the @entity90			0
treatment usually involves using drugs to reduce inflammation and then physiotherapy to help with rehabilitation			0
recovery can take up to two years - one third of patients make a good recovery , one third make a partial recovery and a third show no recovery at all			2
but @entity4 battled on and after months of treatment she relearned how to sit up , before building up her strength to take her first steps			1
@entity4 left hospital just before @entity107 , but was still too weak to even carry a bowl of cereal			2
however , she was determined to keep fighting and wrote a list of goals , including getting dressed and tidying her own room			0
seven months on , @entity4 has crossed off every item on the checklist and is able to move around like any other little girl her age			1
mrs @entity4 said if it was n’t for the hospital staff at the hospital , @entity4 would n’t have made it back to full health			1
she said : ‘ @entity4 is living proof of what the doctors , nurses and everyone else who works in the hospital can do			2
‘ if it was n’t for all the people who worked so hard for @entity4 , we do n’t know where we ’d be today			2
' these people go the extra mile			0
‘ it ’s absolutely outstanding that we have this incredible support and service on our doorstep and we will always be so grateful for what the hospital did for us			0
‘ we ’ll never know exactly what happened , but all we do know is that we have our little girl back			0
‘ the medical teams did a fantastic job with @entity4 , along of course with her determination			2
they all wanted to make her better			0
