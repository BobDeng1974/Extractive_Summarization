by @entity0 published : 06:41 est , 15 november 2012 updated : 11:23 est , 15 november 2012 a father was stunned after council officers asked him to pay rent on a six - foot wide strip of land in his garden			1
@entity7 , 38 , from @entity8 , returned home from a holiday to find a letter from his local authority , @entity12 , demanding an annual rent of £ 50 , which he is refusing to pay			1
transport manager mr @entity7 , who has has lived in the @entity15 property for 12 years , said he had no idea that the small walkway to the side of his house was registered as council land			1
it has been fenced to the property for at least 25 years			0
the row broke out after inspectors at cash - strapped @entity12 in @entity15 carried out an inspection of their assets while mr @entity7 was on holiday in june			1
gathering evidence : @entity7 measuring the six - foot piece of land in contention it emerged the six - foot wide strip , which houses a gravel path , garden shed and part of his decking , may once have been on the site of a disused public highway			1
officials may now seek a court order to ' evict ' mr @entity7 ’s shed and gravel path unless he pays rent			1
they have also charged him £ 180 in surveyors fees , claiming the council had a ' duty to manage its assets in the interests of the public '			0
but mr @entity7 said he had already paid £ 550 in legal fees to challenge the council ’s claim , and would continue to fight to make the land legally his own			1
he said : ' i bought the house 12 years ago and there was already a fence attaching the land to my property			1
contentious : @entity7 's backyard , over which he is in dispute with @entity12 ' it ’s just a small piece of land around 6ft wide - it ’s not like it ’s a football pitch			1
yet all of a sudden they ’re saying they own it and they want rent from me			2
' but i ’ve never heard anything before and i had all the usual checks carried out before i bought the house			2
' having to spend that kind of money is n’t great for anyone at any time of year let alone in the run up to @entity79			0
' if the council are now claiming they own my land which has been maintained to a decent standard they should give the road outside a proper permanent @entity87 surface so it comes up to a more acceptable standard too			0
' there have been potholes in the road outside for years			0
i did n’t complain about them myself but i know the other neighbours did and i was hoping the council would fill them in			0
i ca n’t believe they carried out this inspection instead			0
' mr @entity7 , whose wife @entity98 , 34 , was made redundant from her store assistant job earlier this year , discovered the problem in june when he returned from a week 's holiday			1
he added : ' the letter was from " @entity103 " on behalf of the council and it stated that the land was n’t mine and that i ’d have to cough up £ 50 rent a year and £ 180 for surveyor fees			2
' it stated the council took their assets very seriously and that they needed the money			0
' i was absolutely baffled			0
i sent an e-mail saying how on earth was it their land - it was the most ridiculous thing i ’d ever heard			0
i hired a solicitor and have already paid more than £ 500 in fees			0
' my only option is to stick at it and carry on negotiating with the council or basically let them do their worst and take me to court			2
' problem : part of the land in dispute by @entity12 , whose officers have laid claim to it mr @entity7 had his house fully surveyed when he bought it for £ 46,000 in 2000			1
since receiving the letter from the council , he tried to take ' possessory title ' of the land through an application to the @entity136 as he has lived there for more than 10 years			2
but his plea was rejected on the grounds of a legal technicality			0
he said : ' it is something i believed i owned for all those years and for them to take it away in an instant is unbelievable			0
i obviously had my house surveyed when i bought it twelve years ago and this was never mentioned			1
' i am prepared to fight this at the moment , but if too much money gets involved it may be a struggle , especially leading up to @entity79			2
' dispute : part of mr @entity7 's garden may once have been on the site of a disused public highway @entity12 , which is battling to save £ 45m in budget cuts , said officials did not know why the issue of the land had not been flagged up earlier and assumed it must have been ' missed ' on previous occasions			1
councillor @entity163 , cabinet member for housing , transport and planning , said : ' @entity12 is the registered owner of the land and during a recent inspection it was noted there was an encroachment that had n’t been authorised			0
' this information is available to the public and solicitors prior to any house purchase			2
we have quoted our standard garden licence rental and hope we can reach an amicable settlement			0
' defiant : mr @entity7 has vowed to fight the council 's claim on his property and has already paid more than £ 500 in legal fees			1

@entity7 , 38 , returned from a holiday to a letter asking him for rent on part of his garden
if he does not pay up , his garden shed might be evicted by court order
the father has vowed to fight the claim , saying his house was fully surveyed when he bought it
