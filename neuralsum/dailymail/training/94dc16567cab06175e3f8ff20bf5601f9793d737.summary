by @entity0 last updated at 7:45 pm on 20th january 2012 an insurance scheme for cosmetic surgery patients could be introduced in the wake of the breast implant scandal			1
professor sir @entity5 , who is leading a government review into the risks from faulty breast implants said the scheme would protect consumers			1
he said today that he favours a protection fund , paid for by the industry , that could be drawn on if the industry hits trouble or another major scandal erupts			2
however , there are fears that cosmetic surgery companies will simply pass the costs on to patients , in the form of higher bills for treatments			1
protesters gather outside @entity25 on january 14 , after they refused to replace their faulty breast implants			2
the government is now looking at compulsory insurance schemes around 40,000 women in the @entity30 received implants manufactured by the now - closed @entity33 company @entity32 ( @entity32 ) , which were filled with non-medical grade silicone			1
although there is no clear evidence @entity32 implants cause harm , the government has said anxious patients who had their surgery on the @entity42 will be able to have the implants removed and replaced free of charge			1
if there is a clinical need , the @entity42 will also pay to remove , but not replace , implants if a private clinic refuses to do so or no longer exists			2
sir @entity5 said : ' as part of the review , i am keen to work with the cosmetic surgery industry to find a solution which offers protection and help to women when implants unexpectedly fail			1
' the @entity25 ( @entity25 ) , which fitted @entity32 breast implants to almost 14,000 @entity30 women , and transform are among the private firms which have refused to replace the implants for free , despite the government saying private clinics have a moral duty to look after their customers			1
sir @entity5 is leading a government review into @entity32 implants sir @entity5 , who is medical director of the @entity42 , said the scheme under consideration would be similar to the insurance protection scheme in place in the travel industry			1
he told @entity73 's the report : ' one of the things that my review will be looking at will be something rather like the @entity80 arrangement that travel agents have , which means that if an organisation runs into trouble the consumer is covered			1
' companies pay a subscription to become members of @entity80 ( @entity80 ) , which provides a fund for people to fall back on if something goes wrong			1
sir @entity5 said this model ' captured the flavour of where we want to go '			2
a breast implant registry could also be reintroduced to record details of all operations , it was reported			0
it comes a week after @entity100 , chairman of @entity25 , said he wanted the taxpayer to foot the bill to help its patients			1
mr @entity100 said his firm had been made a ‘ scapegoat ’ in the saga and was the victim of a conspiracy by other surgeons who want to see him out of business			0
he said the chain of 31 clinics , like its patients , was an ‘ innocent victim ’ of a regulatory failure , and said it was ‘ outrageous ’ of the government to call on private clinics to take responsibility			1
the group , which had a turnover of more than £ 30million in 2009 , fitted around one in three of the 45,000 @entity32 implants sold across the country			0
the chain is currently deluged with around 2,000 calls a day from women , most of whom want their implants removed			0
mr @entity130 's comments caused fury among mps , patients , surgeons and lawyers , who say a clinic ’s first duty is to its patients , not its profits			1
@entity140 suffered burning and stabbing pains when @entity142 had her breasts enlarged , she was thrilled with the results			0
now , four years later and pregnant , the mother of two could n't be more unhappy with them			0
scans show that one – or both – of the @entity32 implants have ruptured			0
but , at five - and - a - half - months pregnant , @entity151 , 39 , of @entity152 in @entity153 , has been advised against surgery to have them out			2
miss @entity142 paid @entity25 £ 5,000 for breast augmentation after enduring years of low self - esteem due to her small bust			0
last year she started experiencing burning pains , and then found lumps in her breasts , raising fears of cancer			2
she now suffers stabbing pains – but has been advised not to have the ruptured implants out when pregnant			0
miss @entity142 believes the @entity25 should pay to remove and replace the implants after she has her baby			0
she added : ' it is their fault this happened			0
i went there in full confidence			0
if it was up to me , i 'd have the implants out right now			0
i worry because i do n't know what was in them			0
