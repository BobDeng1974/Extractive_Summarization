today 's babies could live eight years longer if they are born in the @entity2 than in the @entity3 , new data shows today			1
life expectancy varies wildly between different parts of the country and between the sexes , the @entity4 found			0
the age gap is so stark that healthy adults move from poorer areas in the north to better health areas in the south , leaving those behind with lower life expectancy			2
girls born in @entity22 can expect to live longest ( 86.4 years ) , more than six years longer than @entity23 , where life expectancy was lowest ( 80 )			1
boys born in @entity26 have the highest longevity at 83.0 years - 8.7 years longer than in the area with the lowest , @entity29 ( 74.3 years )			1
life expectancy varied across @entity32 regions and tended to be higher among those in the @entity26 than in the @entity3 and @entity34 , the @entity4 said			1
in 2011/13 , life expectancy at birth was highest in the @entity37 ( 80.4 years ) for males and in @entity39 for females ( 84.1 years )			2
conversely , they were lowest in the @entity3 for males ( 78 years ) and in the @entity43 for females ( 81.7 years )			0
maps released by the @entity4 show how life expectancy is highest in the south and lowest in the north the @entity4 report said : ' studies have shown that the selective migration of healthy individuals from poorer health areas into better health areas as well as socio - economic , environmental ( including working conditions ) , educational and lifestyle factors are largely responsible for the excess mortality and consequently lower life expectancy in northern regions compared with those in the south			2
' nevertheless , life expectancy continues to increase at a faster pace in the northern regions and in @entity39 than the other southern regions			1
one possible explanation is the varying rate of decrease in deaths from avoidable causes across @entity32 regions			0
' since 2001 , the greatest reduction in deaths rates for potentially avoidable causes such as certain cancers , respiratory and heart disease have been seen in the @entity43 , @entity3 and @entity39			0
' however , statisticians said the gap between regions is narrowing			0
life expectancy at birth and at age 65 increased at a faster pace in @entity39 , the @entity43 and the @entity3 compared with other regions between 2007 - 09 and 2011 - 13			1
life expectancy at birth and at age 65 increased at a faster pace in @entity39 , the @entity43 and the @entity3 compared with other regions between 2007 – 09 and 2011 – 13 for males , the greatest increases were seen in @entity39 , the @entity3 and @entity43 while the least were in the @entity90 and @entity37			1
boys born today can expect to live for just under 80 years - nearly four years less than a girl , official figures show			1
life expectancy at birth for males in @entity32 and @entity97 increased from 78.1 years in 2007 to 2009 to 79.3 years in 2011 to 2013 , the @entity4 said			2
the female figure increased from 82.2 to 83 years over the same period			0
but the gap between the sexes continues to narrow , falling from 4.1 years in 2007 - 09 to 3.7 years in 2011 - 13			0
for females , a similar picture was observed with the greatest increases in life expectancy recorded in @entity39 , the @entity105 and the @entity3 and the lowest in the @entity37 and @entity90			2
women from the @entity107 can expect to live 12 years longer than men from @entity29 , according to today 's figures exposing the north - south divide in life expectancy @entity112 , director of policy at the charity @entity114 , said : ' while , we are in the main , living longer lives , these new figures show the health inequality gap is widening			1
' there are clear variations between different areas of the country , with higher life expectancy in the @entity26 and lower life expectancy in @entity3			0
' while there are a range of reasons for such regional variations , this continued increase in health inequalities must be addressed			0
sufficient services and resources should be made available to support older people 's health and social care needs in local areas most at risk			0

@entity4 *reveals* stark differences in life expectancy between the north and south
girls born in @entity22 can expect to live longest ( 86.4 years ) , more than six years longer than @entity23
boys born in @entity26 could live until 83.0 years - 8.7 years longer than in @entity29
life expectancy at birth and at age 65 increased at a faster pace in @entity39 , the @entity43 and the @entity3
