by @entity0 published : 12:57 est , 4 june 2013 updated : 01:41 est , 5 june 2013 @entity2 's floating bullet trains - which will travel at up speeds of up to 311mph - have undergone their first test runs			2
the magnetic levitation , or ' maglev ' trains , use state - of - the - art technology to reach mind - blowing speeds			1
the teams behind the operation aim to have an established track from @entity15 to @entity16 by 2045 , eventually linking the entire country from north to south			1
the maglev trains use magnets to lift the train above the track , eliminating the wheels and therefore any incidence of friction , providing a faster and quieter service maglev trains use magnets to lift the carriages above the track , eliminating the need for wheels and therefore any incidence of friction , providing a faster and quieter service			1
the first five of the @entity45 cars , manufactured by @entity46 ( @entity46 ) , are propelled by magnetic forces and have undergone initial tests that involved being pushed along the track by a maintenance car , the @entity42 reported			2
official test runs are scheduled to begin in september , and are on schedule to be running between @entity15 and @entity53 , the third largest city in @entity2 , by 2027			1
the sleek , aerodynamic trains are the fastest ever manufactured			0
@entity2 is well - established as the world leader in high - speed trains , having developed the first ' bullet train ' in 1964			0
maglev trains are the latest in high speed transport , and have reached up to 361mph in test runs			0
the teams behind the operation aim to have an established track from @entity15 to @entity16 by 2045 , eventually linking the entire country from north to south the commercial service between @entity15 and @entity53 in 2027 will connect the cities in 40 minutes , one - third of time currently required @entity67 was the first country to have a commercially - operated @entity69 service			1
the @entity70 opened to the public in january 2004 , and has a top commercial operational speed of 268mph due to the short track @entity74 cost $ 1.3billion ( Â£ 830million ) to build			2
manufacturers claim that @entity69 technology is less polluting than the flights that currently link the cities			0
@entity79 : a test model maglev train from 2003			0
officials claim the high - tech mass transit system is the future of travel @entity85 : @entity70 's $ 1.33billion maglev train has a top operating speed of 267mph			0

the trains use magnetic levitation technology instead of wheels
the @entity15 to @entity53 travel time will be cut from *90* minutes to 40 minutes
$ 64bn project to build a track linking @entity15 to @entity16 by 2045
the first five carriages will be ready for commercial use in 2027
