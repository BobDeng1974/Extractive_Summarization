on more than 50 courses at universities across the country , in subjects ranging from engineering to @entity12 , 100 per cent of students were awarded a @entity14 or a 2:1 critics said universities were pushing up grades as a ‘ marketing ploy ’ to attract students paying up to £ 9,000 a year , and warned that degrees no longer reflect the true abilities of graduates			1
however , universities said the rises reflected improvements in a-level grades			1

the @entity66 warned that where student numbers on courses are very low , a few individual results could skew the outcome			0
but the agency ’s own data showed a record two - thirds of all students got either a @entity14 or a 2:1 in 2012			2
professor @entity76 , director of the @entity77 at @entity78 , said that grade inflation had become ‘ rampant ’ because there were no national standards for degrees , and it enabled institutions to boost their rankings in league tables			0
fellow @entity78 academic professor @entity86 said : ‘ it is the “ all must have prizes ” approach			0
’ @entity91 professor @entity90 said grade inflation was a ‘ marketing ploy ’			2
but @entity92 , chief executive of @entity93 , said : ‘ there may be a range of factors behind these results			0
the number of students on many of the courses is small			0
the degrees in question also represent a fraction of the courses often available at individual universities			0
‘ the proportion of firsts and 2:1s has increased marginally in recent years , reflecting increases in entry qualifications			0
a-level performance has improved , as have learning methods			0
however , the current degree classification system is a blunt instrument			0
