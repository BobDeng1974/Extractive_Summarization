should his team rise to his challenge of winning their remaining seven matches , the rampant @entity37 outfit would end the season with a remarkable 99 points			1
‘ it ’s a fantastic achievement to win the league			2
it ’s a great day for the club , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ the objective for the season was to get promoted			2
we ’ve done that and that will give us a head start in planning for next season — but we need to keep winning games			2
‘ we ’ve got seven games left and we want maximum points			1
we wo n’t be losing focus			2
if we could set a new record for points for the division , then that would be fantastic			2

we ca n’t be turning up at venues and losing games			0
we want to win , starting with three more points against @entity71 at @entity10 next weekend			2
’ @entity0 believes his side ’s 2 - 1 stoppage - time win at @entity74 against @entity7 on the opening day of the season set the tone for a fine campaign			1
but it was n’t until a battling 2 - 1 victory at @entity71 on february 21 that he truly believed his side was destined to win the league and return to the top flight after one season away			1
‘ i do n’t think you ever take things for granted until you are over the line , ’ he said			0
‘ but i think that @entity71 game was a big one for us away from home			0
we went a goal behind and we had to fight back to get all three points			2
we eventually got there and , from then on , i thought we had a real chance of taking the league			0
‘ but that win against @entity7 on the opening day was a huge one for us in terms of morale and also for our fans			1
a lot of times you can go to @entity74 , go ahead and then @entity7 draw level and you ’re then hoping to hang on for a draw			1
@entity1 ' @entity106 celebrates after giving his side two - goal lead against @entity12 the @entity1 players celebrate as they beat @entity12 and edged closer to an impressive title win ‘ but we went straight up the park and scored again to get all three points and that set the tone for the whole season			1
it gave us a real belief we could go on to win the trophy and now we ’ve done it			0
‘ to finally get over the line is magnificent			0
the players have worked so hard and i could n’t have asked for more			0
‘ we can now speak to players we want to get from outside the club and speak to players at the club and try to renegotiate			0
we ’ve got guys who have been fantastic for us and we want to keep hold of them			0
‘ it ’s just a great day and it ’s testament to the support we ’ve had all season from the fans , the hard work of ( owner ) @entity127 and ( director of football ) @entity129 and all the players			0
‘ the fans in particular have been magnificent and they deserve to have a great night and a great few weeks			0
’ meanwhile , @entity1 captain @entity137 admitted it was a relief to finally get over the line after months of being billed as champions - in - waiting			1
@entity1 captain @entity137 revealed his joy after his side became @entity143 winners ‘ it has been difficult , you know , ’ he said			1
‘ since maybe late december and early january people have had us installed as champions			0
so it ’s been tough , not so much to keep your standards up but to put all that talk to one side			2
but we ’ve done that			0
‘ the way the season has panned out , we ’ve been going about our business in the right fashion			0
but if you had asked me at the start of the season whether i thought the gap would have been this big , i probably would n’t have believed you			0
