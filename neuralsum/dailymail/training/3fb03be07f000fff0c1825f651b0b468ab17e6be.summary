a graduate made to work for her jobless benefits as a shelf stacker in @entity3 is taking legal action against the government under the @entity6			1
@entity7 , who studied geology at university , had been unable to find a job in her subject area and was claiming unemployment benefit while volunteering in a museum in the hope it would lead to a job in that sector			1
but the 22 - year - old had to give up the placement in order to work in the budget store under a @entity5 scheme designed to encourage the long - term unemployed back to work			1
work experience : @entity7 said she had to sweep up and fill the shelves at the @entity3 store in @entity26 , @entity27 miss @entity7 is now taking landmark legal action against the government after being told she risked losing her £ 53.45 - a - week @entity31 ( @entity31 ) payment if she turned down the two - week unpaid work experience stint at @entity3			1
lawyers for the graduate are seeking a judicial review into @entity37 rules that compel unemployed people to take unpaid work			1
they say the scheme , part of the @entity43 ’s @entity42 to break the cycle of benefit dependency , amounts to ‘ forced labour ’ and is against the @entity6			1
the @entity5 programme aims to help around 250,000 young people over the next two years through training and unpaid work experience in the public , private and charity sectors			1
placement providers include chains such as @entity54 , @entity55 ’s , @entity56 and @entity57			1
but miss @entity7 said : ‘ i was actually doing something that was helping me work towards a job and was taken away from that to do something of no value to me			1
’ the graduate was sucked into the scheme after attending a retail jobs ‘ open day ’ in the autumn at the suggestion of her @entity70 adviser , who said it would lead to a period of training and a job interview			0
miss @entity7 and other candidates were sent to an employment skills training workshop for a week , aimed at improving attributes such as communication skills , followed by the five - hour - a - day stint at @entity3 near @entity82 ’s home in @entity26 , @entity27 , in november			1
she and five other claimants spent their time on the placement sweeping up and stacking and cleaning shelves , before they had to attend a final week of training under the ‘ sector - based work academy ’ scheme ( @entity89 )			1
the promised job interview never materialised			0
the @entity89 scheme is supposed to offer the young unemployed a direct route off benefits and into work			2
graduate : miss @entity7 has been looking for work since she left @entity97 ( pictured ) and had been volunteering on an unpaid basis miss @entity7 graduated from @entity97 in 2010 and has been claiming unemployment benefit since august			1
she has now returned to her voluntary role at the city ’s @entity101 of writing and pen trade memorabilia , still looking for paid employment			0
she believes the placement allowed @entity3 to use her as ‘ free labour ’ in the run - up to @entity109			1
the @entity37 says that candidates who ‘ express an interest ’ in doing unpaid placements will lose their @entity31 if they pull out after the first ‘ cooling off ’ week on the scheme			2
but miss @entity7 says she was not informed about any cooling off period			1
in order to meet the criteria to receive the @entity31 benefit , claimants are required to participate in @entity119 , skills and @entity121			0
the scheme offers work placements with companies , working in conjunction with the government , designed to give claimants practical work experience to improve their chances of employment			2
if claimants refuse to take part in the work placements they risk losing their benefits			2
she said she felt she had to do it because ‘ without my @entity31 , i would literally have nothing ’			0
miss @entity7 ’s solicitor , @entity137 , said the practice contravenes article 4 ( 2 ) of the @entity6 , which states : ‘ no one shall be required to perform forced or compulsory labour			1
’ mr @entity137 , from @entity142 in @entity27 , said : ‘ this government has created – without parliamentary authority – a complex array of schemes that allow @entity147 to force people into futile , unpaid labour for weeks or months at a time			2
‘ we have no problem with @entity5 schemes that increase the chances of people gaining employment – that is key to combating the current economic crisis – but these “ work for benefit schemes ” have been proven in other countries to do nothing other than increase the cycle of unemployment and poverty			2
‘ @entity7 was n’t told when she went to the open day that she was committing herself to work for free			1
she has been taken away from a voluntary role useful to help her break into the career she would like to have , simply to stack shelves			0
’ latest figures show there are now more than one million young people not in employment , education or training – so - called @entity175			2
employment minister @entity176 said : ‘ we think it ’s really important to provide young people with the opportunity to get into workplaces and show what they can do			0
‘ it ’s a nonsense to suggest we should just be leaving them on benefits without making a real effort to find work			2
@entity188 offers really good career opportunities for many young people			0
’ @entity3 said it had a ‘ positive experience ’ of the work placement programme which was ‘ designed to provide on - the - job training for those looking to retail as a career opportunity ’			1

the company said it had been ' inundated ' with 1,385 applications for the 16 advertised positions at the new store , which opens on february 18			0
@entity211 , @entity205 's mayor , welcomed the store and called for other companies to invest in the resort , adding : ' it ’s a very positive thing for the town that a national company is coming here			0
' i do n’t know if desperation is the word			0
it shows there ’s a massive shortage of long - term employment jobs and that we need further inward investment			0
' he added that he expected vacancies at the proposed @entity229 in @entity205 to be similarly oversubscribed			0
it is expected to create 60 permanent jobs when it opens an 83 - bed hotel			0
