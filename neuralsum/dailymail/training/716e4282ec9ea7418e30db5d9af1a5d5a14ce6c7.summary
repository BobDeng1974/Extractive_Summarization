by @entity0 @entity1 is in @entity3 painting with @entity4 but the 12 - year - old has a dark secret she is worried about sharing ; she is a @entity7 fan			1
her father is to blame she says and he would n't like her talking to an @entity10 player			1
@entity11 has @entity12 which affects her heart and breathing			2
she and her family are regular visitors to the @entity18 - based hospice that gives respite and care for children with life - limiting conditions			2
@entity1 is happy sharing centre stage with the children			1
he is a huge fan and has chosen the hospice as one of the charities to benefit from his forthcoming testimonial when @entity10 face @entity28 at @entity29 this sunday			1
@entity45 : @entity47 ; @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 ; @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 ; @entity56 , @entity57 ( sub : @entity59 ) scorers : @entity53 14 ; @entity56 50 , 68 , 83 @entity10 : @entity61 ; @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 ; @entity66 ( sub : @entity68 ) , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 ( sub : @entity1 ) ; @entity73 , @entity74 scorers : @entity73 10 , @entity65 58 , @entity74 74 ref : @entity76 : 36,070 his connection was borne out of tragedy , a family bereavement			1
@entity1 lost two cousins , sisters @entity82 and @entity81 , to cystic fibrosis			1
seeing what his family went through made @entity1 , a father of three young children himself , want to help			1
' i connected from probably the first time i came here , ' he says taking a pause from his poster - paint landscape			2
' i was deeply moved by everything that is done			0
' i had a family bereavement a few years back and they did n't get as far as @entity3			1
the @entity97 , the other charity i support , took them away but this would have been the next step			0
' i saw at first hand what a difference they can make to not just the kids but parents too			0
it provides families with good memories and gives them a break from what they are going through			0
i just wanted to try and help with the process			0
' the 33 - year - old @entity1 does n't really fit with football stereotypes			1
a slightly - built , clever , technically gifted player , he made his breakthrough when the @entity117 's penchant was for tall , strong and powerful			1
even then a serious knee injury almost derailed his career before it had begun			0
still got it : @entity1 scores against @entity121 in a pre-season friendly win true blue : @entity1 ( right ) has played for @entity10 more than 11 years now he has been with boyhood club @entity10 since the age of 10			1
a member of their 1998 @entity128 winning side with the likes of @entity130 , @entity131 and @entity132 , he scored in the final against @entity134 with a clipped right foot volley			2
it is 11 years since @entity1 made his league debut for @entity10 as a late substitute for @entity139 midfielder @entity71 in a 4 - 3 defeat at @entity45			1
the game was also notable for being goalkeeper @entity61 's only @entity10 appearance while @entity56 grabbed a hat - trick and a certain @entity145 manager @entity53 was also on target for @entity45			1
more than 380 appearances later , @entity1 is being rewarded with his testimonial against @entity28			1
' i certainly never envisaged being here , ' he reflected			0
' i did n't look that far ahead			0
it was all about setting goals ; going from the youth team , getting games for the reserves , getting games for the first team			0
national service : @entity1 ( right ) with @entity159 and @entity160 ( centre ) in february last year proud : @entity1 has two @entity163 caps and addressed the media before a friendly against @entity166 in 2012 technically gifted : @entity1 impressed with his range of passing for club and country ' it feels very weird having a testimonial			1
the attention is all on you			0
i have gone through my career without asking for attention so it will be strange knowing everyone is going to be pointing at me as i walk onto the pitch			0
' football has changed so much since that first game			0
when i got into the squad i was told players were looking after themselves better but now it 's much different again			2
' can he reason then with @entity189 midfielder @entity188 's smoking episode ? ' i do n't know about that			2
personally , i 've never smoked and i do n't understand that			0
people go out for a glass of wine but i do n't think there is the drinking through the week anymore that used to go on			0
' players do n't drink much , if at all , in some cases , they eat the right things ; off the field you have computer analysis for preparation			0
you have fitness coaches , who have assistants to assess another part of you , who have assistants to tell you what muscle groups you 're using			0
' when i started there were some doing things the right way , there were some who did n't bother until the day before the game			0
i used to think i could get away with eating what i wanted but now the preparation starts as soon as you finish the last game			0
' @entity223 return marks significant day in @entity10 history record buy : @entity31 completed his £ 28m move to @entity10 from @entity227 @entity1 figured in every league game under @entity230 last season , the only @entity10 player to do so and insists he is still improving			1
i had good advice from great senior pro 's likes @entity234 , @entity64 and @entity235 and i know i 'd be quick to help a young player today if i thought they were n't doing things right			2
you need to if you want to last longer			0
' while two @entity163 caps , picked up against @entity241 and @entity242 , have helped make @entity1 's career more complete there is no disguising what he yearns for most			1
' the one thing , the only thing , since i got into the first team is to win a trophy , ' he says			2
' we 've come close but it has n't been achieved yet and seriously needs to be addressed			0
with the quality of players we have had over the years and now , with the likes of @entity31 joining , we should be challenging			2
' testimonials , trophies ? sounds like a scene @entity1 's fans , even those of @entity7 persuasion , will be happy to paint			1
@entity10 v @entity28 ( sunday 4pm ko ) ; tickets are available at evertonfc.com ; adult tickets £ 20 in advance or £ 25 on matchday ) for more information on @entity3 go to http://www.claire-house.org.uk /			1
