a toy baby will cost @entity3 sniper the @entity4 , movie insiders predict			1
@entity6 's movie picked up six @entity4 nominations and more at the box office than the other seven nominees combined			1
but the scene which shows @entity11 and @entity12 cradling a doll was widely mocked			2
anticipating the outcome of this sunday 's ceremony , a panel of experts agreed that one prop is the movie 's @entity19			1
fatal flaw : this fake baby will prevent @entity24 from winning @entity25 , experts say in a scene where @entity11 and @entity12 discuss @entity29 ' duty to the military , a fake was used the panel assembled by @entity32 on tuesday consisted of movie producer @entity33 , @entity32 's @entity34 , @entity35 of the @entity36 , @entity38 's @entity37 , @entity39 , @entity41 's @entity40			1
@entity25 , they say , will be between @entity43 and @entity44			1
@entity24 would win if it were a public vote , a study showed			0
but the biopic about @entity49 @entity48 , who claimed to have killed 255 people , will be snubbed by the upper echelons of @entity52 , the group agreed			0
according to @entity39 , @entity6 had cast a baby but the child was ill on the day of shooting so he made the fatal error of substituting a plastic doll			1
the movie stoked heated debate over the morality of war - and the art of prop selection			2
feeding : @entity12 had the difficult task of playing @entity65 and breastfeeding the fake baby the man on whom it is based , @entity48 , was shot and killed by a veteran before the movie was completed on the same weekend @entity24 hit movie theaters , director @entity72 tweeted : ' my uncle killed by sniper in @entity76			1
we were taught snipers were cowards			0
will shoot u in the back			0
' he later claimed that his words were incidental and not aimed at the movie			2
@entity87 also hit out at @entity6 's latest piece , likening it to a violent episode in @entity93 's @entity92 - era movie @entity94			1
but it was that baby that merited unabashed ridicule			2
the scene involves @entity11 , as @entity48 , and @entity12 , as @entity65 , having a conversation about him leaving the family and returning to war			0
both parents hold their ' baby ' daughter as they discuss whether soldiers or @entity29 ' wife and children are more important			0
a second instance of using a doll instead of a human occurs earlier in the film , when @entity29 and @entity65 welcome their baby son into the world			2
tough call : because the babies cast in @entity3 sniper were ill , @entity6 decided to use a doll instead nod : the panel of experts believe @entity122 can clear shelf space for her best actress @entity4 already favorite : birdman , starring @entity127 , is tipped as one of the two favorites to take @entity25 early reviews identified the scene as a major flaw for the @entity4 contender			1
on the website @entity136 , for example , reviewer @entity134 wrote , ' i get so distracted by the baby ... the entire rest of the scene , that 's all i can look at			0
' ' neither one of them looks like they are comfortable holding it , ' @entity134 continued , speaking on the actors			0
' @entity11 in particular looks like he 's just plain never held a baby			0
' ' hate to ruin the fun but real baby # 1 showed up with a fever , ' script writer @entity147 tweeted in response to those questioning the choice to use a doll			2
' @entity155 was no show			0
( @entity6 voice ) gim me the doll , kid , ' @entity147 continued in a message published by @entity161			1
the original tweet has since been deleted			0
unanimously , the panel of experts said @entity165 will take home @entity167 , @entity168 the equivalent for @entity170 , and @entity122 will land the @entity171 for @entity172			1
ceremony : @entity174 is presenting this year 's @entity4 show this sunday a @entity177 senior and statistics whiz who uses a mathematical model to predict an @entity4 nominees chance of winning - and has a 75 percent success rate from previous years - also gave the nod to birdman for @entity25			1
however , @entity184 , executive editor of industry journal @entity161 , told @entity186 : ' boyhood and @entity44 are the frontrunners , and @entity24 is the dark horse			2
' according to other forecasters , it could be that the top contenders split best picture and best director , as 12 years a @entity195 did last year			0
' it seems a lot of people are saying that if they vote @entity44 in one of those two categories , they are going to vote @entity43 in the other , ' said @entity202 , editor at awards handicapper @entity204			1
but because of the best picture category 's preferential ballot , in which members rank their top films rather than vote for just one , a movie that is many people 's second choice could prevail			0
for @entity202 , that 's director @entity217 's @entity216			0
@entity25 @entity24 birdman boyhood the @entity216 whiplash the @entity221 the @entity222 best actor @entity127 ( birdman ) @entity225 ( @entity226 ) @entity227 ( @entity228 ) @entity11 ( @entity3 sniper ) @entity230 ( @entity231 ) best actress @entity122 ( @entity172 ) @entity233 ( @entity226 ) @entity234 ( two days , one night ) @entity235 ( @entity236 ) @entity237 ( @entity238 ) best director @entity240 ( @entity228 ) @entity241 ( @entity231 ) @entity242 ( birdman ) @entity244 ( @entity43 ) @entity217 ( @entity216 ) best supporting actor @entity168 ( @entity170 ) @entity246 ( @entity231 ) @entity247 ( birdman ) @entity249 ( @entity250 ) @entity251 ( @entity43 ) best supporting actress @entity253 ( birdman ) @entity165 ( @entity43 ) @entity255 ( @entity256 ) @entity257 ( @entity236 ) @entity258 ( @entity228 )			1
