by @entity0 published : 11:36 est , 23 may 2013 updated : 11:41 est , 23 may 2013 few racing games have generated as much excitement as @entity3			2
so , @entity4 has teamed up with developers @entity6 to answer your questions			2
fans grilled @entity10 , producer for the game , set for release on may 28			1
does @entity6 still have the licences for @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 ? if so , what has stopped you from implementing these series into the @entity21 games , and if not how difficult and expensive would it be to obtain them once again ? @entity10 : ' we would license those properties on a game by game basis – there ’s no reason why not further down the line , but right now our focus is on the @entity21 franchise and what that means for gamers – a comprehensive racing experience			1
' that not only contains licensed touring and super-touring cars , but a vast array of other motorsports , race - modified road cars and supercars for players to get their hands on			2
by including this eclectic content we created our own series called the @entity50 championship ( @entity50 ) to house them all in in a realistic way			1
it is all backed up by @entity54 coverage to make the organisation live and breathe like a real entity			0
' drifting away : expect fan favourites such as the @entity58 ( right ) to make an appearance why is there no @entity61 ? @entity10 : ' with each new game we want to bring a fresh set of content for players to try out , and maybe throw some iconic stuff from the heritage of the @entity21 and @entity70 series in the mix too			1
because @entity61 featured in @entity21 1 , we did n’t necessarily want that to be a first choice in grid 2 before we locked down on plans for our newer content			0
' the new content in @entity3 includes circuits , street racing tracks and point to point road racing , so it meant the choices for traditional circuits were of poured over all the more clinically , before going for the places we chose in the end			1
' we ’ve got @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , the @entity88 and @entity89 in the title , which give a really international feel to the game			1
but there ’s nothing to say pulling the @entity61 track back into the game at some point down the line can not happen			1
' can any car be picked for any type of race on any track ? @entity10 : ' within the @entity103 area of the game that ’s pretty much the case yes ! players can choose to drive open - wheel sportscars on point to point tracks if they so wish			1
you ’ll also be able to define the route , the light condition and the rules of the event			0
however , the career mode has a more realistic approach of placing appropriate vehicles into events and circuits you ’d expect			0
' part of the thrust of what @entity3 is all about , is that we ’re finding the best driver in the world in @entity50 – it ’s mixed discipline , like a decathlon of motorsports			0
each driver will try events outside their standard comfort zone			0
' so for that reason , the events are set up as realistically as possible – open wheelers on traditional circuits and drift machines on city tracks or weaving point to points			1
' ruling the road : the ferocious @entity141 will take all of your skill to bring under control i 've only seen @entity146 - what about @entity148 and @entity149 ? @entity10 : ' the online side of the game has vehicle upgrades which affect the performance of the car – it ’s this side of the game that comes alive as you spend your earned currency on improving your car to compete against the competition			1
' but you also have choice there – you can save that currency and ultimately buy a much more powerful vehicle a little down the line if you can hold enough			0
' will you be doing something to stop people ' driving dirty ' online ? @entity10 : ' @entity169 was something we were really conscious to tackle in the @entity3 multiplayer – i think online there are never going to be complete solutions , but we ’ve made some serious steps forward to resolve some of the worst parts			1
' a large number of known “ bad ” behaviours have been added to our list of things to penalise players for – reversing off the start line , intentionally blocking others , staying still on the track – those things that you really do n’t want to experience to break up your fun as you race have all been tackled			0
' in addition , the way we match - make players in their lobbies online takes this into account their general “ @entity196 ” and the degree to which players are in contact with others and generally breaking the rules whilst racing			2
' if you ’re serious about playing @entity21 and racing fairly , then you should be getting match - made with like - minded players			0
' will there be splitscreen on pcs like in @entity206 ? @entity10 : ' yes , we ’ve included splitscreen for all platforms – it ’s always fun to play with your opponent sitting right next to you ! ' @entity213 fun : as well as street - based events , there are races in stadiums using different breeds of car is there dynamic music and custom tracks ? @entity10 : ' the system works based on multiple stems reacting to the player ’s actions – if you are ahead , behind or way out in front of competition , if you ’re racing in a pack tightly or if you have more space on track			1
' in some cases the music is slightly more rigid in order to work with a game mode – for example , checkpoint works with a ticking timer that players need to keep alive , so the timing of the beats in that in - game score needs to work well			2
' i think it ’s a really fantastic touch , and helps to make the action on - track feel theatrical			0
with that said , it does n’t appear in every race , as sometimes it ’s not appropriate and can detract			0
we ’ve balanced it very particularly			0
' what are the plans for @entity254 ? @entity10 : ' information about our @entity254 plan will be coming around launch time next week			1
in the interim , details of our pre-order bonuses are available on the @entity21 website and facebook page – my particular favourite is the @entity266 pack featuring two new routes for the @entity268 and the @entity266 and @entity269			0
' is there day / night time for each location ? @entity10 : ' we have day , night and dusk settings across most of the tracks and locations			1
' leaving a mark : @entity21 games encourage you to master the drift , but veering off course can be devastating what is the number of difficulty settings ? @entity10 : ' very easy , @entity283 , @entity284 , @entity285 , and very hard ! ' how did you come up with the @entity287 idea ? @entity10 : ' @entity287 was a bi-product of wanting to offer more variation in what players see and play in the game			1
we were inspired a little by open world titles , but actually wanted to retain the sense of a “ race ” and avoid creating something to explore just for the sake of variety			0
' this was a great alternative – really pulling in all the different parts of the cities that we ’ve build but linking them in such a variety of ways that players will hardly ever see the same corner combinations come up twice			0
' what online features will there be ? @entity10 : ' online is a wholly separate part of the game , single player and online are selected separately right at the press start screen , so you ’ll head down a completely alternate path and progression system			1
it has its own currency model and car customisation and upgrades are a key aspect of that			2
' in addition , we have a rivals system to take on players across the world and a @entity331 mode which utilises the @entity333 system			0
@entity333 really comes into its own with @entity3 – it works from web to game as well as game to web , which is a big step for us			2
' have the carmakers allowed random breakdowns and realistic damage or have your hands been tied to keep them happy ? @entity10 : ' we always tread a very careful line with approvals from manufacturers and ultimately have to take their advice , but we have pushed things to be as realistic as possible			1
the vehicles will react more realistically than most of our competitors out there			0
' we have full damage models for each car , have tyre shredding and wheel damage and the @entity358 will occasionally pull up with engine issues – exactly as you ’d expect from real life motorsports			2
' follow us on @entity362 : @ @entity363 and on @entity364 : @entity365 .			0
