by @entity0 published : 14:46 est , 27 may 2013 updated : 17:07 est , 27 may 2013 when @entity2 was paralysed by a form of motor neuron disease it seemed that she would never paint again			1
but now , new technology has allowed the former teacher to produce a series of artworks using only her thoughts			2
the mother - of - four has mastered technology that allows her to paint pictured using the signals that come from her brain			2
. happy : @entity2 has been using technology that reads her brainwaves to create artworks on a computer abstract : @entity2 is given the opportunity to create colourful paintings with the new technology her thoughts control the colours , shapes and brushes she uses as the computer translates the tiny impulses to form pictures , reports the @entity25 now , the artist is set to exhibit her work in @entity28 , near @entity29 in @entity30			1
ms @entity2 , who has @entity32 ’s disease in 2007 , said : ‘ i had never been fond of technical equipment , and despised working with a computer			1
‘ brain - computer interface is a breakthrough technology that enables me with my thoughts to create art. concentration and thoughts create expressive images			0
for the first time , this project gives me the opportunity to show the world that the disease has not been the end of my life			0
’ ms @entity2 is only able to move her eyes after being left paralysed by the disease and now sells her colourful paintings online			1
amazing : the computer captures @entity2 's thoughts , allowing her to manipulate shapes and colour development : @entity2 describes the system as allowing her to get back into painting after her paralysis technology : the system was developed after scientists were studying how to allow people to use social media @entity64 shapes : @entity65 uses the computer screen to create her art. she now sells it online electrodes are embedded in a cap that the user wears , and detects what options they want to choose			1
in future , the electrodes would be implanted into the cortex of the brain to increase the effectiveness of the process			0
the technology could also be used to give people who are paralyzed the opportunity to communicate			0
it detects changes in brainwave patterns , showing what the user wants to do			0
but researchers are now looking to plant a device into the brain to allow computers to connect with the user directly			0
technology : @entity2 is fitted with the cap as begins her drawings @entity96 : the electrodes are embedded into the cap and read the changes in @entity65 's brainwaves the future : scientists hope that the technology can be embedded in user 's brains to make the experience easier and more accurate dr @entity107 said the technology has come a long way : ‘ ten years ago we needed a whole week of training to get enough data for it to work accurately , but now we need just five minutes or less			1
’ the device comes from studies on how to allow patients to use social media such as @entity117 or @entity118 more effectively , but he describes painting as a more creative form of @entity121 scientists are working with researchers in @entity124 to develop the brain implant technology .			2

@entity2 was paralysed by a form of motor neuron disease
she has now created a series of paintings using new technology
reads changes in brainwaves allowing users to choose between colours , shapes and tools
