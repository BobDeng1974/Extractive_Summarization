lucky : one - year - old @entity5 dramatically cheated death after falling 10 feet out of a first floor window ( pictured directly above his mother @entity17 's head ) and landing on a tiny discarded cushion fall : @entity5 's life was saved because his 10 foot fall was broken by a foot - square dining chair cushion ( pictured beneath his foot , right )			1
his relieved mother @entity27 ( left ) described the incident as ' horrifying ' @entity5 's life was saved because his 10 foot fall was broken by a foot - square dining chair cushion			1
as he sustained a hairline skull fracture despite landing on the cushion , it is likely he would have suffered fair greater head injuries or even death had he hit the concrete directly			2
