by @entity0 published : 13:02 est , 23 october 2013 updated : 13:02 est , 23 october 2013 as firefighters emerge from another wildfire season in the western @entity4 scientists are working on giving them a 21st century tool - a fire - spotting satellite			1
@entity4 researchers said such a satellite could view the @entity9 @entity4 almost continuously , snapping pictures of the ground every few seconds in search of hot spots that could be newly ignited wildfires			1
firefighting resources could then be directed to these spots in hope of preventing the fires from growing out of control and threatening lives and property			1
this is an artist 's concept of the @entity25 satellite , which would snap digital photos of the @entity9 @entity4 every few seconds in search of hot spots that could be newly ignited fires the scientists , from the @entity29 , have designed a satellite using state - of - the - art sensors , written analysis software to minimize false alarms and have even given it a name â€“ the @entity36 in @entity37 ( @entity25 )			1
they are hopeful it can be built for several hundred million dollars , either by government or private entities			1
' if we had information on the location of fires when they were smaller , then we could take appropriate actions quicker and more easily , including preparing for evacuation , ' said fire expert @entity48 , a @entity29 associate professor of environmental science , policy and management			1
' wildfires would be smaller in scale if you could detect them before they got too big , like less than an acre			2
' professor @entity48 , physicist @entity57 , remote sensing expert @entity58 and their colleagues describe the satellite in an article published by the journal @entity65			2
the satellite could help direct firefighting resources to locations to try and prevent fires from growing out of control , like this one in the @entity71 referring to the devastating 1991 fire that destroyed more than 3,000 homes in @entity29 and @entity74 , dr @entity57 , a research associate at the university 's @entity75 and a scientist at @entity78 , said : ' with a satellite like this , we will have a good chance of seeing something from orbit before it becomes an @entity74 fire			1
' it could pay for itself in one firefighting season , he added			0
professor @entity48 explained that with global warming , wildfires are expected to become more frequent and more extensive			0
this year alone , @entity93 's firefighting arm , @entity94 , has responded to over 6,000 wildfires - 1,600 more than average - according to tweets by the department 's information officer @entity97			1
wildfire - prone areas stretching from @entity101 to @entity102 could also benefit from their own dedicated satellites			0
fire detection today is much like it was 200 years ago , professor @entity48 said			0
it relies primarily on spotters in fire towers or on the ground and on reports from members of the public , although this information is augmented by aerial reconnaissance and lightning detectors that steer firefighters to ground strikes , which are one of the most common causes of wildfires			1
' even today , most fires are detected , in some way or another , by people , ' he said			0
but satellite technology , remote sensing and computing have advanced to the stage where it is now possible to orbit a geostationary satellite that can reliably distinguish small , but spreading , wildfires with few false alarms			1
dr @entity57 estimates that the satellite , which could be built and operated by the federal government , like the @entity133 ( goes ) , as a partnership between government and the private sector like the @entity139 satellite program , or by a private company alone , would cost several hundred million dollars - a fraction of the nation 's $ 2.5 billion yearly firefighting budget			1

here , wildfires destroy parts of @entity71 in @entity93 the idea of a fire detection satellite has been floated before , but until recently , detectors have been prohibitively expensive and the difficulty of discriminating a small burning area from other bright hotspots , such as sunlight glinting off a mirror or windshield , made the likelihood of false alarms high			2
today , computers are faster , detectors cheaper and more sensitive , and analysis software far more advanced , making false alarms much less likely , according to the researchers			0
' simply put , we believe we have shown that this kind of rapid , sensitive fire detection of areas bigger than 10 feet on a side is probably feasible from space , and we have evidence that the false alarm rate will not be crazy , ' said dr @entity57 , who has designed sensitive satellite - borne detectors for 40 years			0
with global warming , wildfires are expected to become more frequent so wildfire - prone areas stretching from @entity101 to @entity102 could benefit from similar satellites , according to the scientists			2
they said the satellite could pay for itself in one firefighting season			2
the burned remains of one of the homes on @entity190 near @entity191 , @entity93 are pictured dr @entity58 said : ' in concept , this is a simple system : a telephoto camera , an infrared filter and a recording device			0
' we are just looking for something bright compared to the surroundings or changing over time ' then , we do these rapid calculations to determine if one image is different from the next , ' she said			0
dr @entity57 and graduate student @entity204 developed a computer analysis technique , or algorithm , to detect these differences in space and time and to distinguish them from bright lights that might look like fires			0
this involves several billion calculations per second on images taken every few seconds , covering the entire @entity216 every few minutes			0
the new paper reports on tests of this algorithm using existing imagery from real fires , but the team hopes to get funding to test the system on a fire that is starting , such as a prescribed burn .			0

@entity4 researchers said the satellite could snap pictures of the ground every few seconds in search of spots that could be newly ignited wildfires
firefighting resources could be directed to hot spots in hope of preventing the fires from growing out of control
@entity29 scientists said the satellite , which could cost several hundred million dollars , would cut the cost of the @entity4 ' $ 2.5bn annual firefighting bill
