@entity1 jockey @entity0 performed one of the most expected u-turns in the world of sport when he scrapped plans to retire			1
the 34 - year - old ’s unplaced effort on @entity9 in the @entity10 had meant to be one of the @entity14 rider ’s last race rides			2
but he will now continue to compete as a freelance during 2015			0
@entity0 ( left ) confirmed he would not be retiring after riding @entity9 at the @entity10 @entity0 will compete as a freelance after leaving sheik @entity18 ’s ( centre ) @entity19 @entity0 surprisingly announced his retirement in august 24 hours before it was confirmed that @entity21 was to replace him as no 1 jockey to sheik @entity18 ’s @entity19 organisation			1
the decision was accompanied with plans that @entity0 was to become one of the @entity18 ’s management team			1
but , after initial strenuous denials , @entity0 was later to confirm that there had been no elaborate plan and that his initial decision to walk away from riding had been prompted by the hurt and humiliation this complex character felt after being informed he was going to be sacked			1
@entity0 is looking forward to being ' entirely free ' some bookmakers priced up a market that @entity0 , who won the 1998 @entity39 on @entity40 when only 17 , would return but some , like @entity41 , felt the odds would be so short on him changing his mind , it was not worth the ink			2
the same firm now make his @entity46 5 - 1 to win the @entity47 in march , a ride which alone must have effected @entity0 ’s plans			1
in a pre-prepared statement , @entity0 said : ‘ i have discussed at length with @entity52 my decision to carry on riding and he fully understands and supports me			2
‘ he appreciates racing is what made me happy and the last thing he wants to do is stand in the way of that			0
‘ i will be riding primarily as a freelance but obviously i have certain links and relationships with trainers that i will be utilising			0
‘ i am also looking forward to being entirely free for the first time in six seasons and developing new associations			0
‘ i have no specific target other than to continue to be successful			0
’ @entity0 , who was 2004 champion jockey in @entity14 during his one season as stable jockey to @entity71 , was still riding on the @entity73 all - weather circuit last week , at the time , it hardly seemed the actions of a jockey happy to walk away from the sport			1
now we know why .			0
