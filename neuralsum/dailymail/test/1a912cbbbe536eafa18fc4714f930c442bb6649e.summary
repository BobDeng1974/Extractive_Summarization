@entity0 has a better chance of beating @entity2 now than he did in 2010 , claims his trainer @entity3			1
the pair came close to agreeing a big - money bout five years ago but it eventually fell through , leaving the boxing world waiting and wondering whether they would ever meet			2
but after half a decade of speculation , the pair will finally go head - to - head in @entity11 on may 2 - and @entity3 believes his man will have the advantage at the @entity14			1
@entity0 poses with his family and author @entity16 in a photo posted to his @entity19 account @entity2 continues his training as he prepares to face @entity0 after years of speculation @entity0 's trainer , @entity3 , believes his man is ready to beat @entity2 in @entity11 on may 2 asked whether the 2010 or 2015 version of @entity0 would have a better chance of victory against the unbeaten @entity2 , @entity3 told @entity26 : ' that is an interesting question because there are obviously trade - offs between the two versions of @entity0			1
but i am convinced that the 2015 model is the more formidable fighter for a few reasons			0
' back in 2010 , @entity0 was still growing into a welterweight			2
his first two welterweight fights were against @entity37 in 2008 and @entity38 in 2009 where he only weighed 142 and 144 pounds respectively , and in between he dropped down to 138 to fight @entity39			0
' @entity2 has been campaining as a welterweight since 2005 and weighed 150 in his fight against @entity37 so that might have given @entity2 an advantage			0
i still like @entity0 's chances in that fight but i think the @entity0 of today has a lot more in his favour			0
@entity0 is better equipped to beat @entity2 now than he was in 2010 , according to his trainer @entity3 @entity2 is looking to extend his 47 - fight unbeaten streak when he meets @entity0 next month the pair will go head - to - head in a $ 300million mega-fight at the @entity14 in @entity11 on may 2 ' in 2010 the two - year age difference between the fighters was not significant to either , but that 's not true today			1
@entity2 at 38 is doing things he did n't do in the past			0
@entity2 is a defensive genius but he has always depended on his legs to perform and you can see now that his legs do not have the same spring or fluidness of his earlier years			0
@entity2 remains the bookmakers ' favourite for the $ 300million mega-fight next month but @entity3 is adamant that @entity0 is primed to cause an upset			1
' the 2015 version of @entity0 is more mature , smarter and less reckless than the 2010 version , ' said @entity3			2
' he will be treating the ring like a chess board anticipating @entity2 's moves - ready to cut him off and attack every time he creates an opening			0
' i have all the confidence in the world that @entity0 is going to knock @entity2 out on may 2			1
