@entity1 manager @entity0 thinks his team will be ready to challenge for the title again next season			1
having run @entity5 a close second in may their chances of repeating the feat dipped after the sale of @entity10 , the introduction of half - a - dozen new players and injury to @entity14			0
however , @entity0 ' side have started to find their form - including a number of the summer arrivals - in recent weeks and @entity0 believes it is a sign of what they are capable of			1
he believes if they can win some silverware before then - they have an @entity26 fourth round tie against @entity27 at the weekend followed by the second leg of the @entity29 semi-final against tuesday - it will enhance their chances further			1
' we were looking to win a trophy and then come next summer we will be ready to challenge for the title again			1
' this year was about getting into the top four , trying to minimise the impact of so many new signings , giving them time to develop and target a trophy in the cup competitions			2
' @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 - all players who still have a lot to develop			0
' the squad is looking exciting but needs that time to evolve			0
@entity1 defender @entity60 and young forward @entity62 in training @entity1 captain @entity39 shares a joke with @entity62 and @entity72 ' if we can get success in a cup competition this year it will provide greater motivation and stimulation for them to stay together and perform			1
' along the way you have to bring in ready - made quality to help their growth			2
' come the summer time that period of integration should be complete and we can challenge for the title like we did last season			1
' leading that challenge is likely to be midfielder @entity72 , currently vice-captain but favourite to take over the armband when @entity39 moves to the @entity93 at the end of the season			1
@entity0 would not confirm @entity72 was definitely in line for the job but he did praise the 24 - year - old 's development in a leadership role			1
@entity101 striker @entity43 challenges his team - mate @entity102 for the ball in a training drill @entity1 boss @entity0 gives Â£ 25m signing @entity65 some advice at @entity38 that was more than evident when he stood up to @entity110 striker @entity109 both on the pitch and in the tunnel during tuesday 's @entity29 first leg			1
' when i first came in he was searching for his status at the club but the team who brought him in before knew he was a good persona and a strong character and that has continued , ' added the @entity122 boss			2
' now you see his leadership qualities on and off the field ; he will protect the team and his colleagues and he is a wonderful ambassador for the club			0
' i felt by giving him the vice-captain he could carry that if @entity39 was n't playing and he does it with great pride and honour			0
' as a footballer he is still improving and developing and he will continue to do that			0
' he was given the vice-captaincy role , that does n't always mean that player goes on to become the captain			0
@entity0 has seen his team 's form improve of late and they are unbeaten in over a month @entity142 has started to make his make at @entity144 after a slow start to his @entity1 career @entity0 ' side face @entity27 on saturday before visiting @entity110 for the second leg of the @entity29 semi ' but certainly at this moment in time when @entity39 does n't play he does it in great fashion			1
' when you see him in the tunnel leading out the team he has great presence and good status and the supporters respond to him , ' he is in a really good moment			0
' looking to the future , @entity0 is hopeful of tying up the details on @entity62 's long - awaited contract extension soon			1
' it is something the club are speaking with his representatives on and i would think that would be concluded very imminently , ' he said			0
' the player is very happy			0
it ( the delay ) is nothing to do with @entity62 , he wants to be here so hopefully we get the solution on that very soon			0
' @entity0 is still waiting for the even longer - awaited return from injury of @entity14 , who has not played for the @entity122 since august 31			2
' we are still waiting and still working			0
he wo n't be available for the weekend , ' @entity0 said .			2
