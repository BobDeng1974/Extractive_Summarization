by @entity0 published : 17:09 est , 22 december 2012 updated : 10:38 est , 24 december 2012 i ’ve noticed people peering at me oddly			1
but i have n’t taken offence			1
because the stares have been followed up with the most compliments i have ever had about my skin in my entire life			2
and that ’s not something you expect when you are a year shy of 50			2
the reason ? for the past four months , i have regularly been subjected to a staggering 69,000 injections in my face , as one of the first people in the country to trial the latest , non-surgical facelift on the market			1
this is a skin - tightening and rejuvenating system combining three of the most promising minimally invasive techniques : micro-needling , radiofrequency ( a type of heat ) skin tightening and lasers			1
unlike lasers that burn the surface of the skin , @entity21 injects radiofrequency heat energy into the deepest layers of the skin via needles as fine as a human hair			1
it works by creating thousands of microscopic wounds which stimulate tired old skin cells to go into overdrive , producing new , fresh , young collagen			2
the makers of @entity21 claim this will lead to tighter , firmer , brighter skin , with smaller pores			1
it is even said to lift sagging jawlines , soften crow ’s feet , fill out acne scars , remove red veins and cure acne , because it kills the bacteria that cause spots and reduces the activity of oil glands in the skin			2
but do n’t think this treatment is like a pampering facial			1
remember those 69,000 needle pricks ? here come the needles : @entity0 , 49 , receiving the anti-aging treatment from dr @entity77 before treatment , i was slathered in a powerful anaesthetic cream			1
at one point , i nervously licked my lips , and ended up with a numb tongue as well as face			1
then it was time to face the @entity86			1
dr @entity77 showed me the device and i could see that when a button was pressed , dozens of teeny needles would shoot out			2
and with that i lay on the couch			2
dr @entity77 started on my forehead			2
she switched to deeper needles on my cheek where there is more fat , and shallow ones over the nose where there is n’t			2
the overall sensation is of warmth , but when the needles hit bony areas , there is a sharp , brief pain			2
the needling took less than half an hour , and then i relaxed with a cooling mask for 15 minutes			0
but afterwards my face was scarlet and there were tiny droplets of bright red blood under the skin on my nose			1
i ’m not allowed to wear make - up , so i put on big sunglasses and stop for a coffee , but nobody comments			1
as the redness fades , i develop stripes of tiny scabs on my cheeks and grid marks of more scabs on my forehead			0
i look as if i ’ve been savaged by a cat			0
my husband is visibly shocked : ‘ what on earth have you done to yourself ? ’ he says			0
no pain , no gain , i say			0
the next day , i have teeny bruises under my eyes , and the stripes on my cheeks are still vivid			0
my husband anxiously asks : ‘ will you get better ? ’ and something else happens			0
i erupt into horrible spots			0
dr @entity77 warned that a brief attack of acne may be a side effect , but there are also tiny red drops of blood in every pore on my nose and three big scratches on my cheek			0
the needles of doom : deeper needles are used on the cheeks where more fat is stored while shorter needles are on shallow parts of the face such as the nose on day five , i use a chemical peel dr @entity77 gave me in an aftercare pack			1
the next day my skin looks smoother but the red blood spots in my pores and the scratches are still there			0
however , i start to notice the skin around my eyes looks fresher			0
it takes two weeks for my skin woes to completely disappear			0
when , six weeks later , i arrive for treatment number two – for best results they recommend this – i am nervous			1
dr @entity77 says my reaction was extreme and very unusual			0
and this time things are very different			0
the redness fades completely in a few hours and my skin looks just a little pink , with no scabs			0
my skin looks brighter and clearer and my jawline tighter already			0
i return for my third treatment , almost four months after the first , and it ’s a breeze			1
yes , the needles are a bit ouchy at times , but even though she uses a high level of energy , all i have to show for it is some transient redness , a few minute blood speckles , and a tiny sprinkling of almost invisible scabs on one cheek and above one eye , which disappear in a few days			1
i can see subtle changes			0
my brows are more arched , my cheeks look fuller and my jawline tighter , as if everything ’s slightly lifted			0
my nose to mouth lines are softer and , on the right hand side of my face , have almost vanished			1
what does n’t really show in photographs is that my skin glows and feels bouncier and my pores are smaller			0
@entity21 is expensive , and the results may not be dramatic			1
but friends , mums at the school gate and even people i barely know notice a difference			0
i tell them they just need to find nearly £ 2,000 – and endure those 69,000 needles .			1
