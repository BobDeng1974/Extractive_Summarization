by @entity0 published : 09:35 est , 16 september 2013 updated : 02:26 est , 18 september 2013 if you want to know what the latest ‘ @entity5 ’ is , the one on @entity2 ’s arm is usually a pretty good place to start			2
at the moment that ’s @entity9 ’s @entity8 handbag , which is selling out across @entity10 as fashionistas flock to get their hands on one			1
but would - be buyers have to have deep pockets – it costs up to £ 3,250			2
assistants at the @entity9 shop in new @entity18 , @entity19 , said the bags had sold out			2
they are unlikely to be back in stock until the end of the month , and then in small numbers – prompting suspicions the shortage may be a marketing ruse			0
but is it worth the wait – and the cash ? fashion writer @entity30 gives her verdict … a-list fan : @entity2 has been spotted with a @entity33 after parting with a significant amount of cash for this season ’s must - have bag , it ’s more than a little galling when it becomes noticeably ‘ last season ’			1
it ’s even worse when the design pops up everywhere , thanks to labels and prints now being notoriously easy to fake			0
@entity9 , with its much - copied tan and brown monogram design , must have felt the latter particularly keenly			2
which explains why , with the understated @entity8 , the @entity53 label is turning the emphasis away from trends and back to timeless style			0
the bag is named after the @entity58 in @entity59 , where @entity9 opened his first shop in 1854			2
with it , the brand seems to be celebrating craftsmanship rather than the brash logos for which it has been known of late			0
creating a buzz : @entity9 launched the £ 3,000 @entity33 bag earlier this year with the help of @entity68 waiting list : there 's currently only one of the @entity33 bags displayed as a sample in @entity9 's @entity19 's @entity18 store indeed , the success of the bag marks a turnaround for the brand , which has been struggling to win back its reputation as an upmarket and exclusive label			1
the @entity8 is made with full - grain @entity83 calf - leather , which comes from the top layer of a hide			0
it is subjected to minimal chemical processing ( which can weaken it ) and so is known for its quality , durability and signature texture			0
this is the same leather used by @entity92 – which is famous for still operating long waiting lists for its coveted @entity95 and @entity96 bags , decades after they launched			1
in demand : @entity68 models the different colours of the bag - but for others who want to get their hands on it , there 's currently a waiting list at stores across @entity10 assistants in @entity9 stores have suggested the brand is also using @entity92 ’s tactic of ‘ drip - feeding ’ limited numbers of the @entity8 into shops , to encourage demand			1
so there we have it			0
those with serious money to spend – the @entity8 costs £ 3,000 in medium , and £ 3,250 in large – will be making a serious style understatement this season			1
if you ’d like to follow suit for less , take a look at @entity128			0
the label offers bags which are just as nice , at a tenth of the price			0
or , on the high street , @entity133 has a classic leather bag with a simple metal tab for a much more purse - friendly £ 109			1
@entity2 's must - have : the fact one of the world 's most beautiful women has the bag makes it even more desirable to fashionistas hard to get : the bag comes in a variety of colours but is currently unavailable to buy via the fashion house 's website how to wear : @entity2 demonstrates how the bag can be worn with the distinctive flap tucked in for easier access , left , or folded over the top			1
