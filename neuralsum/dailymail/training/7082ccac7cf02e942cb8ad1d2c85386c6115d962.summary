by @entity0 last updated at 2:10 am on 21st june 2011 thousands of chanting demonstrators took to @entity3 ’s streets yesterday denouncing beleaguered president @entity5 ’s latest bit to stop the protests tearing his country apart			1
in a televised address , he promised his regime would consider political reforms by the end of the year but gave no sign that he would step down – the key demand of a nationwide protest that has seen 1,300 killed in a brutal crackdown by security forces			2
instead of reaching out to the protestors , he blamed the anti-government demonstrations on a small group of ' saboteurs ' that was exploiting popular grievances			2
address : @entity3 president @entity5 makes a rare televised speech as he seeks to calms tensions ' vandalism , not reform ' : @entity3 's president @entity5 hit out at ' saboteurs ' are trying to exploit legitimate demands for reform ' what is happening has nothing to do with reform			1
it has to do with vandalism , ' @entity5 told supporters at @entity34 , where he stood before red , white and black @entity3 flags			1
' there can be no development without stability , and no reform through vandalism			1
' within hours , protestors were back on the streets braving security forces to give their defiant and clear answer			2
in @entity46 , a suburb of the @entity3 capital @entity48 , 300 demonstrators chanted : ' no to dialogue with murderers , ' while in the @entity53 and @entity54 districts of the coastal city of @entity56 , where several @entity53 neighbourhoods have been surrounded by troops and armour for weeks , protesters chanted ' liar , liar '			1
@entity5 ’s speech came hours after foreign secretary @entity63 warned that the leader must implement reforms or ' step aside			1
' ' the @entity66 looks to him , ' mr @entity63 said , ' to respond to legitimate grievances , to release prisoners of conscience , to open up access to the internet and freedom of the media			1
' he called on @entity74 , which has provided shelter to some 10,000 refugees fleeing the crackdown , to put pressure on the @entity5 regime that they are losing legitimacy			1
@entity5 ’s 70 - minute , tv address was only his third public speech since the pro-democracy uprising began in march , inspired by the revolutions in @entity86 and @entity87			1
much of his message was not new , including his claim that the unrest is being driven by armed thugs and foreign conspirators			2
despite saying that he would consider ending his @entity95 ’s monopoly on power , the opposition immediately dismissed the speech , saying it lacked any clear move toward democracy			2
protest : @entity3 wave national flags as they take to the streets to demonstrate after the president 's address @entity104 , of the @entity105 , said : ' it was a very disappointing speech			1
the regime has no realisation that this is a mass street movement demanding freedom and dignity			0
@entity5 has not said anything to satisfy the families of the 1,400 martyrs or the national aspiration of the @entity3 people for the country to become a democracy			1
' @entity118 , leader of the @entity119 , dismissed it			0
' a theoretical speech as always , ' he said , ' he repeated old promises that do not offer a solution and are not implemented on the ground			0
he kept on saying @entity3 was subject to a conspiracies that he likened to germs			0
he has been giving promises since day one			0
the street will continue its march toward freedom			0
' he promised to hold the killers accountable			0
but the killers are his relatives and clique			0
first among them is his brother @entity135 , then the rest of the security apparatus			0
' one activist in @entity56 said : ' people were still hoping he would say something meaningful that would result in tanks and troops leaving the streets			2
they were disappointed and started going out as soon as @entity5 finished talking , ' fleeing : refugee camps have sprung up in @entity74 following prolonged civil unrest in @entity3 innocent victims : @entity3 children climb the fence that surrounds their refugee camp during a spontaneous protest against president @entity5 supporters of president @entity5 march in @entity48 after after he delivered a speech protests spread to other @entity3 cities and in @entity164 , scene of a 1982 attack to crush an uprising led by the @entity119 that killed thousands of civilians during the rule of @entity5 ’s father , @entity163 , protesters chanted ' damn your soul , @entity167 '			1
demonstrations also took place in the eastern city of @entity172 on the border with @entity174 , the southern city of @entity175 and other towns in the @entity177 , cradle of the uprising , now in its fourth month , and at the campus of @entity181 , activists said			0
clearly intent on riding out the storm of protests , @entity5 , 45 , who inherited power in 2000 after his father ’s death , has made a series of overtures to try to ease the growing outrage , lifting the decades - old emergency laws that give the regime a free hand to arrest people without charge and granting @entity3 nationality to thousands of @entity197 , a long - ostracized minority			1
he warned that the country ’s economy will take a beating unless the unrest ends - a message aimed at his supporters in the business community and prosperous merchant classes			0
' the most dangerous thing we face in the coming period is the weakness or the collapse of the @entity3 economy , ' he said			0
' we want the people to back to reforms but we must isolate true reformers from saboteurs , ' he said			0
