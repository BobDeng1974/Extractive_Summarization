in the end it was a cry for help			0
the great pity is that nobody within the @entity6 camp detected a problem until @entity8 summoned the courage to speak to the head coach on saturday morning			1
' @entity12 , can i have a word ? ' was the first time @entity15 became aware of an issue with the forward 's condition , mental or physical , ahead of a @entity20 qualifier in @entity21 the following day			1
after the game , which @entity6 won 1 - 0 , @entity15 spoke candidly about the exchange he had with @entity8 at the team 's @entity25 training base			1
@entity8 ( second from left ) watches @entity6 take on @entity21 from the bench in @entity29 the @entity31 star had complained of leg weariness to manager @entity15 the day before the game @entity8 came on in the second half and won the free - kick which led to @entity36 's winning goal @entity15 's decisiveness , moving @entity38 to the tip of the diamond , caught @entity8 by surprise			1
he was asked to wear a bib : substitute			0
@entity38 's promotion can be traced to the players ' bar at @entity47 last thursday , when @entity15 was raving about his second - half performance in the 5 - 0 thumping of @entity50			1
to those present it was clear that @entity15 wanted to re-align the team to accommodate him for the trip to @entity29			2
@entity38 slows the game down , a @entity55 - type figure behind the main forward line , a player who lets his brain and his boots do the talking			0
@entity15 wanted @entity8 and @entity38 in the team , but with precious little preparation time before the team travelled to @entity21 , he could n't find a solution			1
@entity66 was earmarked to play ahead of @entity67			0
@entity68 has been put on such a pedestal by @entity15 that he appears undroppable			2
@entity70 , who is one of @entity8 's close friends , is a fixture in the team because of his ceaseless running			1
@entity8 , then , unexpectedly provided @entity6 's head coach with an opportunity to shuffle the pack			1
so , how did an organisation that prides itself on sourcing specialists from every conceivable field fail to notice @entity8 's introspection ? ' you should always try to look for that , ' conceded @entity15			1
' our record over the last two - and - a - half years has not been too bad in terms of looking after players			2
' we have very good medical and fitness staff and we do try to consider these things			0
' could they have done better , or has @entity8 really burnt out already ? coaches , medical staff , sports scientists , the unit leaders @entity15 has appointed within his squad , could have seen the warning signs			1
saliva tests , a morning routine for the top teams , are supposed to flag up fatigue or duress			0
even @entity6 's much - trumpeted psychiatrist dr @entity102 , who was with the national team for @entity50 ( but did n't travel to @entity21 ) , failed to realise something was troubling the forward			1
@entity38 , @entity106 's @entity31 team - mate , was picked in his place after impressing against @entity50 @entity8 uses his pace to burst away from @entity21 's @entity109 at the @entity110 on sunday evening psychiatrist dr @entity102 ( left ) failed to spot that there was something troubling @entity8 @entity8 is only 19 and he needs time to adjust to his unexpected , rapid elevation in the game			1
you can not turn on a television , listen to the radio , or attend a @entity31 or @entity6 press conference without being told that he is the ' best teenager in football '			2
to be spoken of in these terms takes some adjustment			0
@entity36 , becoming a pastoral presence now that he is captain , has spoken to @entity8 about these pressures			2
stories abound about @entity8 's future , with claims that @entity127 and @entity128 hope to sign him from @entity31			1
the issues over his £ 30,0000 - a - week contract , reported by @entity131 10 days ago , add to the focus on a player who tells friends that he is never happier than when he is out on a pitch with a ball			0
in the early hours of monday , when he stepped off the plane that took the team back to @entity141 , his @entity138 account was full of vile comments from outraged @entity6 fans			2
before he took himself off to bed he re-tweeted a couple of them and added , endearingly , ' i 'm only human '			0
@entity8 is reportedly wanted by the likes of @entity150 giants @entity127 and @entity128 the 19 - year - old has become one of @entity15 's most important players in a short space of time he is a talented boy , but he is operating under different demands now that he has been bracketed among the best teenagers in the world			1
suddenly he must win every game for club and country			2
it is n't fair , but the wider issue is the inability of the @entity6 set - up to notice a potential problem with their star turn			1
for the avoidance of any doubt , here is @entity15 's response on thursday to a question about the @entity6 set - up managing the expectations around @entity8			1
' we are conscious of managing it , ' he said			0
' i do n't think it will need managing until he shows signs of suffering from it			0
when @entity8 shows signs of not being quite as sharp , not doing as well , trying too hard , that might be the moment we think we have to manage this and give him a break			2
' but that is not the case at the moment and i do n't think @entity31 need to worry			2
his first half against @entity50 was as lively as it could have been			0
@entity8 , pictured celebrating a goal against @entity192 , began the season in fine form for @entity31 the former @entity196 youngster was taken off at half - time during @entity6 's 5 - 0 win against @entity50 ' at half time i said , ' i am taking you two ( @entity106 and @entity70 ) off ' , and they looked at me like , ' do n't do that — we want to stay on ' and that is quite nice			1
' it is possible all the publicity caused @entity8 to panic			0
judging by his performance in @entity21 , where he came on with the game still goalless , the rest has done him good			0
he looked revitalised , without a hint of fatigue in his performance , as he went on to win the 74th - minute free - kick on the edge of the area that was despatched beyond @entity218 by @entity36			0
@entity106 's is highly unusual behaviour , particularly in a sport that traditionally counts on characters , especially in @entity222 , to battle through			0
perhaps this incident is confirmation that those gutsy performances we demanded from anyone playing in an @entity6 shirt are a thing of the past			0
if that is the case , the sport must adapt to these needs			0

@entity15 started @entity8 on the bench against @entity21
the @entity31 star had complained of tiredness but was happy to play
he came on in the second half and helped the @entity6 win 1 - 0
but nobody in the @entity6 camp had spotted @entity8 's problem
the 19 - year - old needs more support to be a star for his country
