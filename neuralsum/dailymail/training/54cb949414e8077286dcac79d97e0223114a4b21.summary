by @entity0 , @entity1 editor home loans taken on by first - time buyers are at their highest level since records began 40 years ago , according to alarming figures from banks and building societies			1
typically , young buyers are borrowing the equivalent of 3.47 times their gross household income , leaving them particularly vulnerable to any rise in interest rates , which could come later this year			1
the trend appears to be at odds with the affordability tests brought in by the @entity17 in april			1
how much ? first - time buyers are taking on the highest number of loans since records began 40 years ago its mortgage market review ( @entity23 ) has required lenders to make much more stringent checks on the income and spending patterns of buyers to ensure they can meet repayments			2
in theory , these affordability tests look at everything from spending on haircuts to gambling , holidays and childcare before agreeing a loan			1
many experts predicted that the review would lead to a sharp fall in new buyers and long delays in mortgage approvals			2
however , figures released by the @entity46 yesterday suggest this has not happened			1
there were 28,600 loans adding up to £ 4.2billion to first - time buyers in june			2
this was a rise of 7.1 per cent on the previous month and 18.7 per cent higher than in june 2013			1
at the same time , the average loan rose to £ 123,865			1
the june increase took the total number of loans to first - time buyers to 79,900 for the second quarter of 2014 , which was up by 24 per cent on the same period last year			1
@entity58 , of analysts @entity59 , said the figures ‘ suggest that the mortgage market review has not slammed the brakes on lending ’ the @entity46 said the average loan in relation to income has been rising steadily over the past year from 3.33 in the second quarter of 2013 to 3.47 today			1
this is the highest figure recorded by the @entity46 since it began collecting the data in 1974			1
looking at the whole property market , the @entity46 figures show that a total of 171,000 loans for house purchases were approved in the second quarter of 2013 , up by 19 per cent on a year ago			1
@entity58 , of analysts @entity59 , said the figures ‘ suggest that the mortgage market review has not slammed the brakes on lending ’			1
he added : ‘ the breakdown between types of buyer shows that it is first - time buyers who are still driving the rise in lending			0
there is no evidence that the mortgage market review has tightened up lending criteria			2
’ mr @entity58 said an increase in interest rates would put a strain on those carrying big mortgages			0
‘ that said , we only expect interest rates to rise very gradually next year , ’ he added			2
during past property booms , some young buyers were borrowing five or six times their income , while others effectively invented a claimed income in order to borrow huge sums under so - called self - certified mortgages			0
however this was always a minority and the mean figure for all first - time buyers was generally around three times income			0
@entity110 , of the @entity46 , said the review had not had the effect anticipated by many in the industry			1
he added : ‘ for the second month running since new @entity17 rules took effect , lending characteristics remain similar to the market beforehand			1
‘ we now feel confident that , as we would hope , the @entity23 effect is more gentle dampener than hard brake			0
‘ as we recently suggested in our revised forecasts , lending levels should continue to increase modestly over the course of the year , driven mostly by house purchase but with remortgaging also recovering			2
’ getting the right mortgage is essential to making sure buying a home is as affordable as possible			0
