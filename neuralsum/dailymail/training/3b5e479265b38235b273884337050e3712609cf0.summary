by all rights the golfing world should be agog following @entity3 ’s wondrous display in @entity4 , @entity6 ’s jaw - dropping troubles in @entity7 and the astonishing feat of a 17 - year - old girl from @entity10 becoming the youngest world no 1 in the entire game ’s history			1
instead , the two main topics of conversation are the act of sheer lunacy in taking live coverage of @entity19 off terrestrial television and @entity3 ’s court case involving his former management company which is due to begin in @entity23 on tuesday			1
if you want to shoot yourself in the foot , why not do it like golf — and use a howitzer ? @entity3 is heading for a potentially lengthy court case with his former management company the @entity30 reportedly made an £ 8million offer to settle the case out of court @entity3 has reached that blessed state precious few golfers ever manage , where they begin knowing that if they summon up 85 per cent of their capabilities in any given week there really is nothing anyone else can do			1
and yet , in a state of affairs that almost beggars belief , the eagles that will be on the 25 - year - old ’s mind for the next fortnight or more will be of the legal kind			2
i have it on decent authority that @entity3 offered € 10million ( almost £ 8m ) to settle out of court with @entity51 and its owner , @entity53 , and end what the world no 1 described himself as a ‘ tedious and nasty business ’			1
but @entity57 , with his reputation at stake , appears determined to have his day , or rather his several weeks , in court			2
it promises to be toe - curlingly tawdry at times and wholly damaging to a sport that relies so much on the goodwill of big business to keep the show on the road			0
what will the @entity67 be thinking as the two sides tear lumps out of one another and the financial affairs of the sport ’s most marketable commodity are laid bare ? what ’s it all about ? @entity3 is both suing @entity51 and being counter-sued in turn for unpaid fees			1
@entity3 has vowed not to let the legal proceeding distract him from his performance on tour @entity3 is given a kiss from his mother @entity83 after winning the @entity84 in a nutshell , @entity51 believe they have a watertight contract entitling them to somewhere between 15 and 20 per cent of @entity3 ’s endorsement money until 2017			1
given that @entity91 alone will pay @entity3 $ 100m over the duration , it ’s not hard to see why @entity57 is fighting tooth and nail			2
@entity3 ’s lawyers will argue the contract signed was ‘ unconscionable , and an improvident bargain ’ , and that @entity3 was coerced into signing it without proper legal representation			1
you can just imagine what the senior counsel are going to be like seeking to prove their respective arguments , ca n’t you ? in @entity4 on sunday , @entity3 did n’t sound like a man who expected the matter to be settled on the steps of @entity23 ’s @entity108 on tuesday morning			2
he talked about being in the witness stand for as much as two weeks , before being blissfully released to concentrate on his preparations for the masters in april			0
@entity3 's team argue that the deal he signed with @entity51 was ‘ unconscionable and an improvident bargain ’ the 25 - year - old will be released from court to prepare for @entity111 , the only major he is yet to win thankfully , it ’s unlikely to affect him at all in that regard			1
as he showed in the @entity119 last week , he ’s become brilliant at putting the blinkers on			0
and so by some time next month we should be back where we want to be , watching the man who has taken @entity126 golf to a whole new level demonstrating why he ’s going to rewrite every meaningful @entity129 record			0
but first to the @entity108 , where alongside a couple of murder trials , we find a sport seemingly consumed with a death wish			0
‘ the accusations made against me are serious and were intended to damage my reputation and character			0
they will not be taken lightly			0
my team and representatives are looking into all aspects of this matter , and we look forward to setting the record straight			0
’ @entity143 ( right ) played alongside @entity6 at last week 's @entity144 @entity146 @entity145 star @entity143 responds to a lurid series of allegations in a new book , in which the four - time @entity151 winner is said to have cheated in tournaments and stolen money from team - mates during his college days at @entity156			1
he was said to have been so unpopular that his team - mates were hoping he ’d lose his match when they reached the @entity160 final			0
we might not have heard the last of this one , i fancy			0
@entity163 smashes tiger 's record the minimum age to play on the women ’s @entity151 in @entity146 is supposed to be 18 but what choice did they have but to waive this regulation in the face of the startling performances of @entity173 ? @entity10 's @entity173 has become the youngest ever player to reach no 1 in the world rankings @entity177 reached world no 1 at 17 - four years before @entity6 managed when he topped the rankings in 1997 by the time the exemption was granted last june , the extraordinary @entity180 was already a two - time champion , including a victory in the @entity184 at the age of 15			1
seven months on from becoming a member , and still only 17 , she reached the summit of the women ’s world rankings last saturday , beating @entity6 , the previous record - holder of either sex , by four years			2
what an achievement that is , given the welcome revival in women ’s golf in @entity146 , led by the likes of @entity197 , @entity198 and @entity199 .			0

@entity3 is due in court for a legal battle with @entity51
the world no 1 reportedly offered £ 8m to settle the lawsuit out of court
@entity143 has responded to allegations of stealing made in a new book
