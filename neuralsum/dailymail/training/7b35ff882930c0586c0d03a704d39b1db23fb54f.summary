@entity0 cut to the chase in summing up exactly why he and his @entity3 management team have gone back to @entity4 , a blast from the distant , tainted past			1
‘ i think the cycle of the team has reached a point where the development bit stops , ’ said the head coach			1
‘ it ’s about the winning			2
’ his remark , after announcing a squad to prepare for the @entity18 opener against @entity19 that also includes the mercurial @entity20 , will delight those who have bemoaned the frequent talk of lessons and journeys			1
@entity26 ' 36 - year - old forward @entity4 was handed a recall to the @entity3 set - up the pragmatic quest for results has become the first and overwhelming focus , and the inclusion of @entity20 and 36 - year - old @entity33 , who has been in international exile since the last @entity35 , symbolises that			1
after the painstaking creation of a new culture , collective spirit and sense of national pride , @entity0 and his assistants have recognised the profound need to choose the best available men to win matches , even if that means altering entrenched perceptions			1
so @entity33 , who was part of the ill - fated 2011 campaign , has been given a chance			1
‘ the last time i spoke to him face to face was 2011 and a fair amount of water has passed under the bridge since then , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ he was aware that his name was coming back into the frame and he was also aware through my conversations with @entity61 ( @entity62 , his director of rugby ) that with @entity64 ’s injury , he could get a chance			2
@entity33 has been in out of the international picture for some time and was part of the ill - fated 2011 team @entity3 head coach @entity0 announced his training squad at @entity72 on wednesday ‘ who was to say in 2011 that he was still going to be playing as well as he is now ? it ’s a great credit to him for doing that and now , in a @entity35 year , with @entity64 injured , the opportunity has arisen			1
to me , he expressed his desire to not finish his @entity3 career on the @entity79 and to come back and finish the story			1
‘ he has convinced me he will buy into us as a group and i think he ’ll add real value			2
he ’s got it all on to get into the team , as we know how well @entity86 is playing , but you would n’t rule him out because of what he has done since 2011			0
’ @entity33 has been a colossal influence for @entity26 this season , as he has been in so many recent campaigns , and there is some justification in his assertion that he is playing better than ever before			1
forwards coach @entity94 acknowledged how he has maintained his fitness , joking : ‘ he ’s quick for an old - timer and you ca n’t dispute how well he ’s playing			1
’ lancaster with his forwards coach @entity94 ( left ) and backs coach @entity102 ( right ) @entity94 praised @entity33 's performances and added that he ' is quick for an old - timer ' but more significant is the desire of @entity100 , @entity106 , @entity102 and @entity107 to revise their view of @entity33 the man , given his links to the previous regime			1
@entity0 was adamant that his cultural revolution will not be compromised			2
‘ what happened in 2011 is history but also we did draw a line under it pretty quickly in january 2012 , ’ he said			0
‘ we made 15 changes to the squad			0
there were some difficult decisions to be made at the time			0
i ’m confident in the culture and the environment we ’ve got now and the senior players who drive it			0
someone like @entity4 can be a part of it and add to it			1
’ as ever , midfield selection will generate debate ahead of the opener in @entity135 on february 6 , but despite high praise for the @entity138 ’s @entity137 and the electric @entity139 , the coaches ’ pragmatism will also be illustrated by their centre choices			0
@entity20 was also recalled to the @entity3 set up by head coach @entity0 on wednesday @entity102 said : ‘ @entity142 played well against @entity143 in a big game and you ’ve got to look at how @entity146 played in the autumn series			1
against @entity148 he was pretty immense really			0
’ so : barritt at 12 , @entity142 at 13			0
meanwhile , @entity0 revealed that he will issue a further warning to hooker @entity150 about his discipline after his recent three - week ban for elbowing @entity143 ’s @entity153			1
‘ i ’m going to speak to him in camp , ’ he said			0
‘ i ’ll be making it crystal clear to dylan one to one , but more so the team , that discipline has to be top notch			0
if we give away dumb penalties against @entity19 , @entity160 can kick them from anywhere and it ’s going to compromise our chances			0
’ that wo n’t be tolerated , not now the head coach has confirmed that results are the be-all and end - all			1
@entity170 balance the perennial thorny issue — who to play at centre			0
calls for @entity138 fliers are set to be ignored , with @entity146 and @entity142 likely to join forces against @entity19			2
loosehead prop @entity3 have an embarrassment of riches in this position			0
@entity181 and @entity182 are @entity183 back from injury but @entity185 deserves to be retained			0
second lock absence of @entity188 and @entity189 has left a second - row void			2
@entity191 emerged well in the autumn but @entity192 is the front - runner to partner @entity194			2
scrum - half another area of supreme strength			2
@entity198 and @entity199 are strong challengers but @entity201 is in great form and worthy of keeping his place for now			0
tight or loose @entity3 ’s strategic plan is unclear			0
they expanded their repertoire in the last @entity18 to good effect but later problems saw them revert to pack power to beat @entity148 .			0
