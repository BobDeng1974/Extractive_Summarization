the great apes at a @entity7 zoo enjoy video - calling other apes on their @entity3 via @entity11 , and like watching other zoo creatures such as penguins			1
they can even draw their own artworks			0
' the @entity17 @entity16 is a perfect device for orangutans , ' say the researchers			2

the great apes have an innate ability to use touchscreens , say the researchers the ' apps for @entity28 ' project came into being because orangutans need constant stimulation - otherwise they become bored or depressed the ' apps for @entity28 ' project came into being because orangutans need constant stimulation - otherwise they become bored or depressed			1
previous experiments have proved that the animals have an innate ability to use touchcreens			1
' the original idea came literally when @entity37 gave his opening presentation introducing the @entity16 , ' said conservationist @entity39			1
' @entity40 , one of our supporters in @entity7 was at the zoo showing the orangutan his @entity16 , and they were fascinated by it			0
we started to put things together			0

even when not watching each other , the apes seem to enjoy colours and movement , the researchers say the apes can recognise and enjoy videos of other animals such as penguins - and even make their own art. but it 's video - calling that might be the most valuable - particularly for lonely apes in zoos far away from their homes			1
' by using wireless internet connections and free video technology such as @entity11 , orangutans - with close guidance from their keepers - can communicate with each other over long distance , keeping mothers and babies in contact , ' say the researchers			1

it is not known what this painting represents the reseachers are now looking for donations of ' lightly used ' @entity16 for the orangutans - who have a habit of damaging the devices			2
' we would like to consult with @entity17 's engineers to work together to make them as ' orangutan - proof ' as possible , ' say the researchers			0
the devices could also be useful for educating orangutans in zoos about how to survive in the wild			0
' it can show images of foods they can eat as well as those to avoid			0
they will be able to learn about predators and learn how to climb and navigate their way around the treetops by watching video footage of orangutans in action , ' say the researchers			1
