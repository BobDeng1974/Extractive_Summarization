by @entity0 published : 14:27 est , 18 april 2013 updated : 16:06 est , 18 april 2013 when people go on the customary estate agent 's tour of a flat before deciding whether or not to rent it , they often prepare themselves for the unexpected			2
but little could prepare one @entity8 couple for what they walked in on when they viewed a one - bedroom flat in @entity13			1
lying in bed was the body of a 35 - year - old @entity17 man who police believe had been there for days			1
@entity19 and her boyfriend were shocked to find a dead body when they viewed a rental property in @entity13 , @entity8 ( pictured ) the female real estate agent , who was showing the prospective tenants through the flat , stared in horror and burst into tears when the couple who found the body told her what was lying in the bedroom			1
not surprisingly , the inspection was cancelled - and now a row has broken out over why the real estate agency had not looked through the apartment before opening it up for viewing by prospective renters			1
@entity19 , 18 , who was with her boyfriend at the time , said that when she entered the one - bedroom flat there was an ' overpowering smell like dead cats '			1
she told how she and her boyfriend were being shown through the living room by the agent when another couple discovered the dead tenant in the bedroom			1
' the boyfriend of the other couple was walking into the bedroom when he turned , grabbed his girlfriend on the shoulders and turned her away , ' miss @entity19 told the paper ' he came out and said there was something dead in there and i asked if it was a cat			2
but he said , no , it was a person , a human , a body			0
' the real estate agent gave us all a funny look , but then when she saw the body she turned around and there were tears in her eyes			0
' she said ' @entity68 ' and then went to the balcony and shouted to the other agent waiting outside			0
' miss @entity19 said the woman called to her colleague : ' the viewing has been cancelled - do n't let anybody else up here			2
' police said they believed the tenant , a @entity17 man , had been dead for a few days , but there were no suspicious circumstances			1
miss @entity19 said she was glad she had not seen the body , but she and her boyfriend were struggling to cope with the trauma			0
ms @entity19 has criticised the agency over their failure to check the flat prior to the viewing			2
picture shows the lettings boards belonging to estate agents unconnected to the case in @entity13 , @entity8 although she ' felt bad ' for the real estate agent she believed the flat should have been inspected before it was opened for general viewing			1
mr @entity93 , managing director for the @entity95 agency , said the priority was for the welfare of the dead man 's family			1
but he believed all proper procedures had been followed under the regulations			0
' this incident has been a very traumatic process for all concerned , ' said mr @entity93			0
mr @entity93 was supported by the @entity105 of @entity106 , whose president @entity107 , said it appeared the agent had done nothing wrong			0
' the relevant @entity110 requires that agents give ' reasonable notice ' if showing a buyer or prospective tenant through a leased property			0
' in this case notice was given , ' mr @entity107 told the paper			0
' under the circumstances it 's understandable that the agent turned up with clients when she did			0
' she was n't to know that the existing tenant had unfortunately died in the previous few days ' now other agents have been told that their staff should check properties first before taking prospective buyers or tenants inside .			2

police believe the man had been dead for days in the one - bed @entity13 flat
traumatised couple ca n't believe flat was n't inspected by agency beforehand
