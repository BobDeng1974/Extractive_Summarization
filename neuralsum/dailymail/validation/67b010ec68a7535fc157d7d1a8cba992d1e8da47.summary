@entity0 has prioritised holding talks with @entity2 in a bid to resolve the uncertainty around @entity6 ’s summer schedule			1
@entity0 has stepped up preparations for @entity8 this week , taking his under 21 squad to @entity10 — where they will be based during the finals in june			2
on friday they face the @entity13 here in @entity15			0
the @entity16 have been meticulously planning their assault on the tournament and @entity0 has the backing of @entity20 to take his strongest possible squad available , including @entity6			1
@entity6 ( right ) has scored eight goals in ten games for @entity0 's @entity24 @entity0 says he has a good relationship with @entity26 manager @entity2 but the @entity26 striker ’s situation is complicated by his club ’s plans to play a money - spinning friendly in @entity32 at the end of the @entity35 campaign , while @entity36 revealed on thursday they could also play in @entity37 , too			1
it has led to fears that @entity6 , who scored eight goals in 10 games for the @entity42 in qualifying , would be exposed to burnout if he is then made to go on to the @entity13			2
but @entity0 plans to meet for talks with @entity26 manager @entity2 , saying : ‘ the situation with me and @entity2 is good and i have had a ( text ) exchange with @entity6 , so i think that situation is good as well			1
‘ at some point , there needs to be a visit , when we say “ ok , what is the plan ? ”			0
but i am relaxed about the situation			0
we have got a really good relationship with @entity26 and with @entity6			1
@entity6 is currently training with the @entity59 senior squad , but @entity0 wants him to play in the summer @entity6 's situation is complicated by @entity26 's end of season friendlies in @entity32 this summer ‘ @entity2 has been very good			1
he was asked the question “ would you like him to rest ? ” he replied “ yes , but ” — and the “ but ” bit has now gone from the debate			0
i know @entity2 was really proud to play for @entity68 and the experiences i have had with him at @entity26 and @entity71 is that he has always been really supportive of his international players			2
‘ as well as that , every quote i have seen from @entity6 ( about playing for the @entity42 21s this summer ) has been very positive			2
’ @entity0 still has a dilemma over @entity76 , however			0
he has not played for the @entity42 since august 2013 and @entity77 would prefer him to rest this summer after a disappointing season			0
@entity76 was under consideration for this trip , but the midfielder stayed with the senior party			0
@entity76 is eligible for the @entity84 side , but has never played for the @entity24 under @entity0 both @entity76 and @entity85 could travel to the @entity86 despite being in the senior squad ‘ i do feel the situation with @entity76 is different to that of @entity6 , @entity90 and @entity91 , as he has never been in one of my squads , ’ added @entity0			1
‘ i was pleased to see @entity76 named in the senior squad			1
‘ with @entity76 not always in @entity77 ’s starting team i think it was important this time round for @entity20 to back him and keep him involved			0
hopefully that gives @entity76 some belief in what the @entity59 set up think of him and his potential			0

@entity84 boss says he has a good relationship with @entity26 manager
@entity6 is currently in @entity59 senior squad
but @entity0 wants @entity26 striker to go to @entity84 championships
spurs have money - spinning *post-season* friendly in @entity32
