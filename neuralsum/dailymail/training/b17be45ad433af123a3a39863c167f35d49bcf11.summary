@entity0 , the 22 - year - old student who is the mirror - image of risque superstar @entity2			1
@entity4 , from @entity5 , @entity3 is such a dead - ringer for the @entity8 beauty that she ca n't step out the house without being mobbed by screaming @entity2 fans			1
strangers follow @entity4 on her way to work and send her fan mail whilst companies pay her thousands of pounds to endorse their products - making her life not too dissimilar to the @entity19 singer			1

' this happens every day - it does n't matter what i do			2
i ca n't go twenty - four hours without hearing @entity2 's name			1
' i know i could happily give up my part - time job and studies to have a career as a @entity2 lookalike			1
' as a child , @entity4 always felt like the ugly ducking			0
however she became more confident in her looks during her teens			0
she says : ' growing up , i was a very shy girl			0
i was known as the skinny girl with the big forehead			0

' @entity4 - who is single and dating - was fifteen years old when friends at school first noticed her remarkable likeness to the world - famous diva			2

' personally , i never realized i looked like @entity2			2

' people began approaching me in the street asking if i was her and i would see photos of myself going viral on social media			1
' now , @entity4 's incredible likeness to the singer means she is regularly swarmed by strangers believing her to be @entity2			1
resemblance pays off : @entity4 has landed over £ 13,000 worth of clothing contracts in the last year due to her uncanny resemblance ' literally , people mistake me for her all the time ! i only have to step out of the house for an hour before i hear someone say , " @entity111 , is that @entity2 ? " ' at first , i thought it was funny to take a picture with someone who believed i was her and then make their day			1
but as @entity2 gets even more famous , the attention just intensifies			2
' some people follow me into stores or as i 'm driving			2
other times fifteen people will swarm at me all at once to take a picture with me			0
' i do think the attention i get is cool but there have been some scary occasions when some super-fans have followed me on my way to work everyday			0
' and i must admit there have also been moments when i could n't face taking a photo with yet another @entity2 fan			1
but it really makes their day to think they met @entity2			2
i 've never denied anyone a picture			0
' @entity4 says the attention is most extreme when she goes out clubbing			0

' men come up to me all the time , thinking i 'm @entity2 and buying me drinks ! they chat me up and try to get my number			2
' last year , @entity4 was even mistaken for @entity2 when she happened to be partying at the same nightclub as the star 's bad boy ex @entity146			1
she says : ' i was at a club in @entity5 and @entity146 was there			0
because he was there , i guess everyone assumed i was @entity2 ! ' i was casually walking around and all these star - struck people were holding their hand to their hearts backing away from me and staring			1

' one @entity2 fan page on @entity31 mistakenly posted my picture with the caption , ' rare pic of @entity2 ' and @entity2 actually commented on it with ' oh ? ! ' ' but that was the closest i 'd say to her knowing me			1
it was a brief moment but the comments and followers on my @entity31 that came after that was unbelievable			0
