by @entity0 @entity2 's president @entity1 is to boycott a meeting of @entity5 and @entity6 leaders after his wife , who is famous for her lavish shopping sprees in @entity9 , was denied a @entity9 visa			1
a foreign ministry official said the @entity2 leader , 90 , would not be attending a mammoth @entity14 in @entity15 next week due to a ' disagreement on the composition of our delegation '			1
@entity1 and his wife @entity20 , 48 , remain targeted by an @entity9 - wide travel ban but the restriction can be suspended temporarily to allow the head of state to attend international forums			1
refusal : @entity1 ( left ) said he will boycott a meeting of @entity5 and @entity6 leaders after his wife @entity20 ( right ) - who is famous for her lavish shopping sprees in @entity9 - was denied a @entity9 visa @entity2 had earlier urged the @entity29 as a whole to boycott the summit after the @entity6 refused to lift a ban on @entity33 joining her husband 's delegation			1
mrs @entity33 is famous for the shopping trips to @entity9 she would make before being placed under sanctions , and is often referred to as the @entity38 , rather than @entity39 , at home in @entity2			1
as part of their plea for the @entity29 to shun the summit , @entity2 also complained about which politicians and heads of state had and had n't been invited by the @entity6			2
foreign ministry spokesman @entity46 said the @entity6 had not invited @entity48 and the @entity49 - a country that does not have international recognition			0
although the @entity6 has refused to invite @entity48 , a @entity15 official said the @entity29 was free to independently invite its president , @entity52			1
expense : @entity33 ( pictured right , alongside her husband ) is famous for her expensive trips to @entity9			2
she is often referred to as the @entity38 rather than first lady at home in @entity2 the @entity6 said @entity29 chairman @entity57 ( left ) was free to independently invite @entity48 's president @entity52 ( right ) , despite the latter being wanted for war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide @entity52 is wanted by the @entity64 for war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide related to the conflict in the @entity69 region of @entity48			2
@entity2 also complained that @entity70 had been invited to the meeting after the country was suspended from the @entity29 following last year 's coup that saw the @entity74 and president @entity75 ousted from power			0
but diplomats in @entity15 said they were confident there is ' no risk ' of a pullout , despite @entity1 being named one of two @entity29 deputy chairmen in january , and @entity2 chairing the union next year - therefore leaving the country with more potential influence than usual			2
the current chair of the @entity29 is @entity86 president @entity57			0
' we have been discussing this for some time			0
we have reached agreement and @entity2 has been invited but no spouses have been invited , ' the @entity6 official said			0
the @entity6 ambassador to @entity93 , @entity94 , said mrs @entity33 was told she should ' apply through the normal channels ' when her request to accompany her husband was rejected			1
' the @entity6 is just following its legal framework and there ca n't be any movement from that position , ' he added			0
power : in january @entity1 was named one of two @entity29 deputy chairmen , while next year @entity2 will chair the @entity29			0
both these factors leave the country with more potential influence than usual a spokesman for @entity1 said it was ' very strange ' that the @entity6 had decided not to allow his wife to attend the the april 2 - 3 summit , which gathers 90 nations from both continents , including 65 heads of state and government			1
speaking to the state - owned herald newspaper , @entity116 added : ' what @entity118 has put together the @entity6 is trying to separate ... do they expect the president to respect the @entity6 and disrespect his own marriage ? ' @entity123 of the political think - tank @entity124 said the row is just ' a symptom of poisoned relations ' between @entity2 and the @entity6 , ' and old wounds that are proving difficult to heal			0
' both sides should have taken ' a sober approach ' to resolving their long standing differences , suggested @entity123 .			0

the @entity6 has *barred* @entity33 , 48 , joining her husband on @entity15 trip
@entity1 , 90 , was *planning* to attend @entity14 next week
he will now no longer attend after the @entity6 refused to grant his wife a visa
the couple remain under @entity6 sanctions , but these can be temporarily lifted
@entity6 *deemed* mrs @entity33 a *non-essential* *member* of husband 's delegation
