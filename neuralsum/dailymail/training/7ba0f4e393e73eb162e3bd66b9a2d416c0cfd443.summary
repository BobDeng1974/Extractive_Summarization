by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 intend to tap into @entity4 ’s expertise and experience after he retires at the end of this season – and the iconic fly - half is keen to take on a coaching role with the national team			1
@entity12 ’s 34 - year - old playmaker confirmed on monday that he will end his playing career when the current campaign is over – leading to a torrent of tributes to his record - breaking achievements at @entity19 and club level			2
and the man whose drop goal famously clinched the 2003 @entity23 for sir @entity25 ’s @entity2 side expressed a desire to represent his country again one day , in a management or mentoring capacity			1
‘ never say never , ’ said @entity4 , ’ when asked about plans to go into coaching			2
‘ if i can help make a difference – even if it ’s only a small percentage – then i would love to do that			0
with @entity2 ? of course , that would be amazing , but at the same time if i can work with just one person and have a positive effect , that ’s good enough to begin with			2
defining moment : @entity4 kicks the winning drop goal to win the 2003 @entity23 final in @entity40 @entity41 as punch : @entity4 and @entity43 celebrate in the dressing room with the @entity23 trophy ‘ it ’s a real desire of mine , having played with so many people who have helped me in my career			1
i just want to help others get better			0
i would love to have an opportunity to work on a one - to - one , skills basis and hopefully have an effect			0
that ’s where i ’d love to spend my time in rugby , certainly initially			0
’ @entity2 head coach @entity57 greeted the news of @entity4 ’s imminent retirement by indicating that he will aim to involve him with the national squad in some capacity			1
the prospect of the legendary no 10 – well known for his uber - professional approach – being brought in prior to the home @entity23 next year appears remote , but it may not be long before he is seen in a @entity70 tracksuit again			2
asked if he would approach @entity4 about mentoring work with @entity2 , @entity57 said : ‘ i would n’t rule it out long - term , whether it was working with age - grade teams or certain individuals			1
when you ’ve got someone of his calibre and experience , with such a clear influence on so many people , i would certainly want him to feel part of the @entity2 team			0
hamstring scare : @entity57 awaits a verdict on @entity2 full back @entity88 's fitness ‘ i ’m sure in the right place , at the right time , we ’ll invite him into camp and he will be more than welcome to pass on some of that ( experience and knowledge ) to the current coaching team , or directly to senior players or age - grade players as well			1
i think it would be incredible what he could offer young players and senior players too			0
’ meanwhile , @entity57 expects @entity105 full back @entity88 , who suffered a hip injury against @entity107 last saturday , to be fit for the first test against @entity109 on june 7 though hooker @entity110 , who has a shoulder injury , is still struggling			0
@entity107 winger @entity112 has been let off with a warning by the @entity114 after a probe into the incident where he ran at @entity105 ’ @entity117 shouting ‘ miss , miss ’ as the fly - half took a kick at goal			1
twinge : @entity88 tried to play on after injuring his hamstring in the @entity122 semi-final against @entity107			0

@entity4 has said he would be keen to help coach @entity2
fly - half will hang up his boots after the @entity131 @entity130 final
