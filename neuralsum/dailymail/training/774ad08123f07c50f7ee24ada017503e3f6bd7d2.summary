deep terror : a shark is just one of the million samples contained in the new wing of @entity12 's @entity11 slither : these snakes represent a fraction of the preserved samples kept in the museum 's 276,000 glass cylinders it is the first time many of them , some of which date back to the 18th century , have been seen by the general public			1

' these are valuable , irreplaceable cultural assets that have been collected over two centuries and remain indispensable for biological research to this day , and are extensively used internationally , ' the museum said in a statement			0
' it is a milestone for the preservation of our collections and provides optimal conditions for research into biodiversity and evolution			0
' entranced : a little boy looks at preserved eels in the @entity10 of the @entity11 pickled : the jars contain a staggering 81,880 litres of alcohol			1
the samples are spread out over three levels , allowing members of the public to see many for the first time predator and prey : tropical snakes with prey still partially - consumed in their mouths preserved in alcohol preserved : the new wing was completed in 2010 because of the damage the museum sustained during the bombing , many specimens are in a poor condition , often with information missing which has to be painstakingly researched			2
