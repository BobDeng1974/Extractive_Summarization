@entity1 president and ceo @entity0 wants to move the chains on brands ' @entity5 spending by upping the network 's goal to over $ 5million for each 30 - second spot			1
speaking on a conference call with analysts thursday , @entity0 first threw up a $ 6million price tag he expected for the 50th anniversary championship game taking place in 2016			1
' five to six million dollars for a 30 - second spot sounds pretty good to me , ' the @entity15 reported @entity0 as saying , though he later revised the number downwards			1
even a bump to $ 5million per ad would represent an increase of just over a 10 percent on the price of an ad , as airtime for this year 's @entity5 went for $ 4.5million			0
media research firm @entity33 reports that the price of @entity5 commercials has increased 75 percent over the past decade			0
not everyone agrees that stock in the @entity39 's marquee game is still ready to rise			1
' the @entity39 marketplace was softer this year than in previous years , ' one advertising agency executive told the @entity15			2
' they ’ve been struggling in the regular season , the playoffs and filling the @entity5			0
' while the championship game between the @entity47 and the @entity48 had a record audience of 114.5million , some ad buyers had to be compensated for lower regular season numbers			1
with @entity51 : @entity53 voters named the @entity55 spot as their favorite ad of the @entity57 as @entity1 hopes to collect on next year 's spots ' so @entity0 wants a 30 percent increase ? it ’s not happening , ' says another ad executive of @entity0 's upper estimates			0
' they had to go to the second - tier guys to fill the @entity5			2
' ' i ’d be very , very surprised if they get anywhere near $ 6 million , ' the exec said			0
' but there ’s always one sucker			0

@entity0 told analysts thursday on a conference call his range for ad buys in 2016 was ' five to six million '
ad agency executives told the @entity15 that the market would not *support* a bump , considering the @entity39 's *viewer* numbers in the regular season
others said the league *reached* out to ' second - tier ' brands to fill the championship game 's commercial airtime
