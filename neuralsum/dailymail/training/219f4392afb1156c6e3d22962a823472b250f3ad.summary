women who do strenuous activity two to three times a week are 20 per cent less likely to suffer heart problems , new research says exercising vigorously for just ten minutes twice a week is enough to help middle - aged women avoid heart disease , a study has found			1
women who did strenuous activity two to three times a week – enough to cause sweating or a fast heartbeat – were 20 per cent less likely to suffer from heart problems , stroke and blood clots than inactive women , researchers said			1
those who did gentler exercise , such as walking , gardening or cycling , four to six times a week had the same reduction in their risk of heart disease			1
indeed , doing any physical activity at all was found to lower risk by a certain amount , compared with being inactive			0
but surprisingly , getting active more than three times a week did not result in a further drop in risk			2
the chance of heart disease was no lower among the small proportion of women who did some strenuous activity more than three times a week than among those who did so two to three times			1
the @entity38 research , which is published in the journal @entity40 , is based on data from more than a million @entity43 women who took part in the @entity45 , a major health project that was started in 1996			1
the latest analysis was funded by the @entity48 , the @entity49 and @entity50			2
lead author dr @entity51 , a physical activity epidemiologist , said : ‘ inactive middle - aged women should try to do some activity regularly			0
‘ positively , the research showed that every effort to be physically active could contribute to improving heart health			2
women who were active two to three times a week were able to cut the risk of heart disease substantially			1
’ the finding comes during the @entity48 ’s @entity64 , when the charity is urging people to spend ten minutes each day making small lifestyle changes to improve their heart health			1
@entity69 , senior cardiac nurse at the @entity48 , said : ‘ this research reinforces evidence that you do n’t have to run marathons or spend hours at the gym to improve your heart health			1
exercising vigorously for just ten minutes twice a week is enough to help middle - aged women avoid heart disease ‘ even if you do n’t have much time to spare , just a couple of weekly sessions to get your heart rate going can help to reduce your risk of heart disease and stroke			1
’ @entity88 , of @entity50 , commented : ‘ this study shows how important physical activity is for your health – and it ’s not only your heart that stands to benefit			0
‘ even small amounts of physical activity can reduce the risk of breast , bowel and womb cancers			2
‘ being active in any way you can – even if it ’s just walking to the station or getting off the bus a few stops earlier – is a great thing for your overall health			0
’ britons are advised to do at least 150 minutes a week of moderate activity			2
but almost a third get less than 30 minutes of exercise a week , and one in ten does not manage to walk for more than five minutes at a time over a month			2
a can of sugary drink a day increases your risk of dying from heart disease by a third , health campaigners warn			1
they have unveiled a poster campaign to highlight the risks of drinks such as @entity119 and @entity120 , which they say are linked to tooth decay and type 2 diabetes , while a can a day could lead to weight gain of over a stone in a year			0
the campaign , called gulp – @entity127 – comes from the @entity128 , based in @entity129 and funded by the @entity131 and local authorities			0
director @entity132 said : ‘ few people fully realise the harm that sugary drinks can do to your health			0
we ’ve launched our @entity126 campaign to get the message across and take the fight to the manufacturers			0
’ soft drinks are now the largest single source of sugar for teens and children aged four to ten			0
many groups want a tax on the drinks to reduce consumption and fund health schemes			0
recent research by the @entity154 suggests a 20p per litre tax in @entity156 alone could prevent 1,100 cancers , 6,300 cases of type 2 diabetes , and cut the number with heart disease and strokes by 4,300			1
such a levy would add around 7p to the price of a standard can			0
the @entity43 @entity166 accused the campaign of ‘ scaremongering ’ .			0

ten minutes exercise a twice a week can reduce the risk of heart disease
also makes women less likely to suffer from a stroke or blood clots by 20 *%*
applies to gentler exercise such as walking , gardening and cycling
