@entity1 ’s bowling coach @entity0 put it well when he described @entity2 as the most skilful bowler in the world			1
some people objected to that : in their view , the best fast bowler in the game is @entity10			2
but @entity0 chose his words carefully			1
in terms of skill , there is no one to match @entity2			1
i ca n’t think of any bowler i ’ve played with or against , or have watched since i retired a decade ago , who can switch so easily from inswing to outswing — and without giving the batsman the slightest clue what he is doing			2
performer : @entity2 is closing in on sir @entity26 's @entity25 wicket record some of the great swing bowlers — guys like @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity26 — would probably tell you the way to bowl to a left - hander is to set him up for an lbw			1
but @entity2 has often gone the other way , slanting the ball across			1
it ’s an unusual approach for a swing bowler to take , but his record speaks for itself			1
the most amazing aspect of @entity2 ’s bowling is that he has never lost his wrist position while changing between inswing and outswing			1
not only that , but he hides the change brilliantly			0
with most bowlers , you can read what ’s going on			2
when he first came into the team , just before the 2003 @entity52 , he would bowl full , swinging deliveries			0
but he changed over the years because he did n’t want to be one - dimensional			0
he learned to drag his length back on flatter pitches , and to hit the deck harder			0
his performance during the 3 - 1 win in @entity59 in 2010 - 11 was an outstanding example			2
talks a good game : @entity63 coach @entity0 believes that @entity2 is the best seamer in world cricket difference of the opinion : many experts feel that @entity68 's @entity10 is the best bowler in the world @entity70 : @entity2 uses any pent up aggression to snaffle plenty of @entity75 wickets the old @entity2 would never have been able to do that			1
he was also a quiet lad — probably the quietest i ’ve ever played with			0
but he ’s grown in confidence and he ’s realised that he has to make up for the fact that he does n’t have the physical presence of guys like @entity83 or @entity84			0
so he ’s had to make up for that with his body language and a few verbals			0
i do n’t have a problem with that , as long as he does n’t cross the line			0
look at @entity10 : he ’s not shy of a word or two			0
if @entity2 lost that aggression , i think he ’d be half the bowler he is now			1
i rated him very highly right from the start — so highly , in fact , that i probably put him in a couple of situations i should n’t have			0
during our famous @entity52 defeat by @entity59 at @entity100 in 2003 , i should have handed the penultimate over to @entity102 , but i went with @entity2 because of a gut feeling			2
@entity104 slapped him into the scoreboard , and later that evening i apologised to @entity2 for putting him under so much pressure			2
then , on his test debut later that year against @entity108 , i set him a 7 - 2 off - side field , which forced him to bowl wider of off stump than he would have liked			0
but in both cases , it was a show of my admiration for @entity2			2
look at the way he establishes holds over batsmen — be it @entity121 ’s @entity120 earlier in the summer or @entity118 for @entity119 now			1
when he has it over you , he does n’t let go			0
it ’s remarkable to think how he ’s progressed from the bloke who carried the drinks during the 2005 ashes , when the @entity128 of @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 and @entity132 must have made him wonder whether he was ever going to crack it at @entity134			0
instead , he is on the verge of becoming the most successful @entity1 bowler of all time — and one of the most watchable operators in the world game			1
