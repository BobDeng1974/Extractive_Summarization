by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 has rejected appeals against its decision to withdraw funding from @entity7 sports basketball , synchronised swimming and women ’s water polo			1
the funding body has also stood by its decision to cut all funds from @entity14 sports goalball , visually - impaired football and wheelchair fencing			1
@entity2 has changed its decision about women ’s weightlifting and reinstated money totalling £ 894,000 in the build - up to the @entity7 , while badminton has been awarded an extra £ 250,000			1
@entity2 chairman @entity23 admitted that the decisions on zero funding , confirming the original announcement last month , would be unpopular in some quarters			0
cut : @entity28 competes for @entity29 against @entity30 at the @entity31 in @entity32 cut : funding for @entity35 basketball from @entity2 has been cut because the chances of winning medals is low happier days : sisters @entity38 and @entity39 in 2012 - funding for the @entity41 team is cut withdrawn : @entity2 will not be providing any financial support to @entity43 either he said : ' i accept that by its very nature ‘ @entity48 ’ is not universally popular but there ’s one thing we are sure of - it works			0
' the recent outstanding successes at the @entity55 and @entity54 demonstrated once again that investing the right money , in the right athletes , for the right reasons , is a winning formula			0
' @entity23 added : ' the starting point for @entity2 and the @entity61 is that we want to be able to invest in as many @entity55 and @entity54 sports as possible but they must be able to credibly demonstrate medal - winning potential within eight years			1
' @entity67 came back to us with a compelling new strategy focussed on developing their most talented female athletes with a view to challenging for medals by @entity73			0
' strategy : @entity2 says it is only backing sports which have a serious chance of winning medals in eight years also on the list : paralympic sports such as goalball - with @entity81 pictured here - has also seen its funding slashed decision reversed : @entity2 has changed its mind over women 's weightlifting and will continue funding it @entity23 said sports that are not at that level would still receive public funding driving from bodies such as @entity93 which aim to boost grass - roots participation and talent development			1
@entity96 called on sports minister @entity97 to intervene and said it would consider a formal appeal to the independent sports resolutions @entity35 body			0
' this is a very dark and sad day for @entity35 sport - especially for women ’s sport , ' said @entity96 chief executive @entity104			0
' how can an elite programme such as synchro , which has long been held by @entity2 as a model of world class athlete development and leadership , that has achieved all of its performance indicators since it first received funding , have its funding removed just 12 months after it was enhanced ? on target : funding for the @entity54 sport of wheelchair fencing has also been completely removed ' it is a sport that has never failed to deliver on its performance promises and this decision beggars belief - it clearly highlights a fundamental flaw in the @entity2 funding system			2
' on behalf of water polo , synchro and other @entity55 sports that face the real possibility of dying out as a result of today ’s announcement , we call on the sports minister to show leadership in this area by looking at the entire funding system for elite sport			2

@entity2 has decided to withdraw funds from @entity55 sports basketball , synchronised swimming and women 's water polo
funding for @entity54 sports goalball , visually impaired football and wheelchair fencing is also cut in full
@entity2 has reversed its decision to cut funding for women 's weightlifting and has awarded badminton an extra £ 250,000
the funding body accepts its zero funding decision will be unpopular but claims back sports with medal - winning potential is a strategy that works
