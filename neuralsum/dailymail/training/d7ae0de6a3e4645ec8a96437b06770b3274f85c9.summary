at the @entity2 resort in @entity3 , a quick dip could well turn into a marathon			1
swimming a length in this , the world 's largest outdoor pool , would mean stroke after stroke for more than three fifths of a mile - that 's 20 @entity13 - size swimming pools			2
the enormous man - made lagoon is set halfway up the country 's @entity16 , in the city of @entity19 , and is filled with 66 million gallons of crystal clear seawater			2
a little slice of the @entity16 : the world 's biggest pool is three fifths of a mile long and draws water from the ocean , cleaning it and allowing the sun to warm it to @entity29 the pool opened in december 2006 after nearly five years of construction work and is said to have set developers back £ 2million			0
it uses a computer - controlled suction and filtration system to suck water in from the ocean at one end and pump it out at the other , while the sun warms it to @entity29 - nine degrees higher than the sea			0
the pool 's incredible dimensions leave the next biggest floundering in its wake , with the @entity46 in @entity47 measuring a mere 1,575ft long			0
lost at sea : a bather floats on the amazingly clear waters of the vast @entity51 , at the @entity2 resort , @entity3 dazzling blue : a small boat sails round a platform jutting into the lagoon 's 20 - acre expanse big drip : the pool , shown left next to the city of @entity19 , is thought to have cost £ 2million to build man - made paradise : a computer - generated image of the @entity2 resort shows how its semi-circular artificial beaches and filtered waters sit right next to the real thing whatever floats your boat : the record - breaking dimensions mean visitors can paddle or sail their way around the pool instead of swimming by the sea : a couple stroll along the shores of the artificial lake			1

the @entity51 at @entity2 resort , @entity3 , is large enough for sailing and comes with its own fake beach
