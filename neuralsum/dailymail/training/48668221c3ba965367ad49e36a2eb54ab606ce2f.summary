the @entity1 will today pledge to end six - figure pay - offs in the public sector if they win the general election			1
@entity1 sources said the party ’s manifesto will promise the swift introduction of a new ‘ public sector redundancy pay cap ’ to end the culture of obscene ‘ golden goodbyes ’ to fat cats employed by the @entity13			1
in future , pay - offs will be limited to a maximum of £ 95,000 in all but exceptional cases			1
the @entity18 's former deputy boss , @entity17 ( left ) , received £ 949,000 in 2011			0
@entity19 ( right ) received a £ 420,000 payment in 2012 after just 20 months in charge of @entity22 senior managers will also have to hand back a portion of their pay - off if they take another job in the public sector within 12 months			1
the new law will cover the entire public sector , including the civil service , the @entity31 , local government and the @entity18 – where some pay - offs have approached £ 1million			1
the move will enrage civil service unions , particularly as @entity1 sources said the cap will be applied to people in existing jobs , not just those signing new contracts			2
it follows public outrage over a string of gigantic payments to senior officials , many of whom went on to take other jobs elsewhere in the public sector shortly afterwards – a phenomenon known as the ‘ revolving door ’			1
former @entity18 director - general @entity51 received a £ 450,000 pay - off in 2012 after just 54 days in the job			2
@entity54 ’s former deputy director - general , @entity17 , received £ 949,000 in 2011			0
other big winners included @entity31 managers @entity56 and @entity58 , who received pay - offs totalling almost £ 1million in 2013			1
the married couple went on to earn £ 120,000 for four months ’ hospital work shortly afterwards			0
former @entity18 director - general @entity51 ( pictured ) received a £ 450,000 pay - off in 2012 after just 54 days in the job council chiefs have also cashed in under the existing system			2
@entity19 received a £ 420,000 payment in 2012 after just 20 months in charge of @entity22			0
the following year , she was handed a £ 140,000 - a - year job by the @entity69			0
@entity70 was given a £ 168,000 pay - off when his role as chief executive of @entity74 was axed in february last year , only to be re-hired in november			0
treasury minister @entity75 said last night that the time had come to end the culture of huge public sector pay - offs			1
she said : ‘ it ’s not right that hard - working taxpayers , many on low salaries , have to fund huge payouts when well - paid people get made redundant			0
‘ so we ’re going to do something that ’s long overdue and that will bring some fairness back to the system			0
’ @entity91 , chief executive of the @entity92 ’ @entity90 , said : ‘ taxpayers will warmly welcome this announcement			0
‘ over the last few years , these six - figure golden goodbyes have cost hard - pressed taxpayers hundreds of millions of pounds			0
’ the move has the potential to slash the cost of future public sector reorganisations			0
@entity1 sources say the cap would have saved £ 125million in 2011/12 alone			2
only workers earning less than £ 27,000 will be exempt from the cap , in order to protect a small number of long - serving public sector employees on modest incomes			2
the plans will also extend the ability of public sector organisations to claw back payments from people who immediately take a job elsewhere			2
the government has already changed the law to require some money to be repaid if a public servant receiving a pay - off of more than £ 100,000 takes a job in the same sector within 12 months			1
but the @entity120 now plan to remove the £ 100,000 threshold so this applies to all pay - offs .			1
