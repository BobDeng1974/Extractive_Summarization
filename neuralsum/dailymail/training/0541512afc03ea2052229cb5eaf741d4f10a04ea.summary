rarely has a team held such dominance over a division			0
a week barely goes by without @entity3 setting some new record or another and it 's fairly safe to assume that the @entity7 's ' winter champions ' will still be on top in may as well			2
@entity10 's team recorded a perfunctory 2 - 0 win over @entity12 on tuesday night , with goals from @entity14 and @entity15 , and barely broke sweat			1
@entity3 cruised to a 2 - 0 home win over @entity12 on tuesday , with @entity15 ( centre ) on target @entity14 opened the scoring at the @entity21 , his 100th goal for the club @entity10 's side are well on course for another @entity7 triumph in the new year it means they have taken 42 points from a possible 48 so far and enjoy a 12 - point advantage over @entity31 , who can restore that to nine on wednesday evening			1
@entity3 head to @entity34 on friday and then are n't in competitive action again until january 31 , such is the generous @entity37 winter break , but as first halves to the season go , this one has n't been bad			1
most remarkable is @entity3 's frugal defence			0
they have let in just three goals so far , a new @entity7 best			0
it was one - way traffic at the @entity21 on tuesday , with the hosts firing in 31 shots on goal - a season high - and they did n't allow @entity12 a sniff of goal until the 75th minute			1
indeed , @entity51 was more of a sweeper keeper than ever , spending much of the match roaming around in midfield as @entity3 produced wave - after - wave of attack			0
@entity3 's lead at the top of the @entity7 table stands at 12 points with one game to play before the break @entity3 thanked their fans with a spectacular laser and light show at the @entity21 after the match laser beams light up the 75,000 - capacity stadium as the club thank the fans for their support this season @entity3 's mascot , @entity75 , looks out from pitchside as the light and laser show unfolds the team held up a banner reading ' thank you ! you are great ' to the fans after the win over @entity12 @entity51 spent most of the match stationed in midfield as @entity3 attacked in front of him @entity14 's goal was his 100th in competitive matches for the club in just 184 appearances and to cap his night , he was presented with the @entity91			1
the evening also saw @entity92 claim a new record			0
with the right - back in their team , @entity3 have not conceded a goal in 1,106 minutes - a new @entity7 record			2
the previous best was their former player @entity100 , who clocked 1,099 minutes in the team without them conceding during the 2002 - 03 season			0
@entity10 's death - by - passing approach is well refined but seems to be reaching even greater heights with @entity3			1
they have completed an average of 612.6 passes per game this season , more than any other side in @entity115 's top five leagues			2
the @entity3 team gather together to record sing some @entity118 carols for their fans @entity120 tries on a red @entity121 as club mascot @entity123 bear keeps a close eye on proceedings @entity14 gives the thumbs up as the squad sing ' @entity129 ' on the video @entity92 claimed a new @entity7 record for not conceding goals when in the team @entity134 ( left ) has so far completed 1,320 passes in the league this season - more than anyone else @entity134 , meanwhile , has completed 1,320 passes so far this season , more than anyone else playing in @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 and @entity144			1
so what records can be broken in the second half of the season ? if @entity3 beat @entity34 , they will enter the winter break with 45 points , two less than their tally at this stage last season			1
but they can still surpass their own record from 2012 - 13 of total number of points in a season overall			2
they gained 91 that season and can still hit 96 this , though they 'd have to win every game after @entity118			0
on the evidence of the season so far , however , you would n't put it past @entity3 to win the lot			0
@entity168 scores with marvellous trademark finish			0

@entity3 beat @entity12 2 - 0 on tuesday night to move 12 points clear
they have just one more match before the @entity176 break , against @entity34
@entity10 's *men* set new record for least number of goals conceded
they had 31 shots on goal during the @entity12 win - a season best
@entity14 scored his 100th goal for the club in 184 appearances
@entity15 added a second after the break to seal easy win
@entity134 has completed more passes than anyone else in @entity115
