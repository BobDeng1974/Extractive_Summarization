by @entity0 - parkinson last updated at 11:18 am on 4th october 2011 it had to end sometime and sadly , the record - breaking autumn heatwave is expected to finish abruptly today , with temperatures plummeting and strong winds ripping across northern regions			1
the mercury has already begun to drop across the @entity6 and the weather will become even cooler and more unsettled as the week progresses , say forecasters			1
yesterday @entity6 basked in temperatures as high as @entity10 - recorded in @entity11 , @entity12 - but by the end of the week it will be down to @entity15 - a normal autumn day			1
blustery beach : the temperatures have already plummeted in @entity19 , as this picture of @entity21 , @entity17 shows goodbye sunshine : a stunning and colourful scene in @entity24 in the @entity25 as the sun sets on our indian summer last of summer : the @entity29 silhouetted against the setting sun on the last day of record - breaking weather and meteorologists warn that it is time to put away the sun cream as we 're not going to see the sort of sunshine we 've experienced in the past week again until next year			1
the change in weather conditions has already reached the west coast of @entity19 which has been hit by wind and rain			2
the end of the heatwave and this week 's cooler weather will lead to an explosion across the @entity6 of wild mushrooms			1
experts are predicting a bumper crop because of the combination of the hot , dry spring , the cool , damp summer , the unexpected early autumn heat , and the coming rain			0
they have created ideal conditions and mushroom hunters are expected to descend on meadows and commons across the country			2
in @entity63 's @entity62 , fungi expert @entity61 is leading expeditions looking for edible mushrooms but she warned that ' beginners should beware ' of poisonous varieties			2
those conditions could escalate as @entity69 heads across the @entity70 and towards the @entity71			1
the tail - end of the hurricane - currently affecting @entity73 - is due to hit @entity19 , @entity74 and the north of @entity76 by mid-week			1
today the weather is likely to be comfortable but tomorrow rain will cover much of @entity19 and @entity74 before moving south across the rest of the @entity6			0
@entity81 , a forecaster with @entity82 , said : ' it is looking cooler and more unsettled from today with a lot of cloud over southern @entity76 and and a few spots of rain especially in the west			0
' the north will have some blustery showers and it will be quite windy with local gales in the northern isles			2
temperatures in some places will drop by as much as @entity95 , but @entity29 could still see highs of @entity97			2
' @entity69 is expected to bring strong winds and heavy rain by the end of the week the trajectory of @entity69 shows that it could hit the @entity6 some time on thursday night much of the @entity6 will see showers by thursday , with longer spells of rain , continuing strong winds and some thunderstorms across western @entity19 and north - west @entity76			1
parts of @entity19 could even be hit by frost , with temperatures of just 3c or @entity110 expected on friday night			1
mr @entity81 added : ' it is now very unlikely that we will see the temperatures we have had over the past week until early summer next year			0
' the @entity6 's hottest day of 2011 was june 27 when a temperature of @entity115 was recorded at the @entity116 in @entity29			0
all the leaves are brown : and the skies are soon to be grey as more seasonal weather moves in warmly remembered : these scenes on @entity122 beach over the weekend wo n't be seen again until next summer despite the unseasonal sunshine , trees have begun to change colour and @entity126 has said it will operate a ' leaf fall ' timetable until december 10 on some routes			0
some services will depart a few minutes early , meaning they have a longer journey to take account of problems the train might encounter			0
leaves on the rails are crushed by passing trains , forming a slippery film which makes it harder for trains to accelerate away from stations and meaning drivers have to approach station stops more slowly than normal			0
@entity144 runs special rail - cleaning trains but these can only reduce and not completely eliminate the problem , @entity126 said on its website			0
despite the appearance that the @entity6 will be bathed in sunshine on saturday , temperatures will struggle to reach @entity15			0

yesterday 's high of @entity10 will drop to *14c* by friday
tail - end of @entity69 expected to hit north later this week
