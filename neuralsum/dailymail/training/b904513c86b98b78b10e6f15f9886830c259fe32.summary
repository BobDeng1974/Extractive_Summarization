after nearly six months of watching helplessly as the value of @entity4 's stock crumbled , @entity4 employees finally got the greenlight to cash in some of their stock on monday as the ' lock - up ' on trading them expired			2

roughly 234 million shares of @entity4 stock owned by company employees were eligible for trading on monday			2

prepared : the @entity19 opened a day after @entity70 reached @entity71 last year but that storm hit on a sunday rather than the start of the business week shares of @entity4 , which were priced at $ 38 in the ipo , declined to as low of $ 17.55 in september as investors fretted about its slowing revenue growth and limited mobile advertising revenue			1
the implications of the closure of the stock exchange for @entity4 workers came as @entity71 hunkered down for the worst of @entity6			0
it will be the first time since 1888 that the @entity19 will have been closed for two consecutive days because of bad weather			1

much of the @entity91 was at a standstill monday as the storm approached			0
mass transit and schools were closed across the region ahead of the storm hitting land , which was expected to happen later monday			1

last year the @entity19 opened the day after @entity70 â€™s sunday arrival , but as @entity6 is expected to hit on monday its unsure how long the closure may last			1
@entity6 , a category 1 hurricane with sustained winds of 75 mph as of sunday afternoon , had already claimed 65 lives in the @entity132 before it began churning up the @entity91			0
@entity6 has forced the shutdown of transportation systems throughout @entity71 and public schools			0
