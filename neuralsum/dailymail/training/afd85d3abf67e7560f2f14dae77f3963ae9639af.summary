by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 16 november 2013 @entity2 : 11:43 est , 17 november 2013 tragic : @entity3 , 16 , was murdered by @entity3 , 19 , in may 2008 whilst at the @entity4 in @entity5 , @entity6 after listening to families whose children have been murdered through street violence , i found it impossible to ignore their pleas for help in finding solutions to a problem which has blighted too many lives			2
i often reflect on the bravery and courage shown by @entity19 and @entity20 , whose teenage son @entity21 was murdered in 2008			0
the @entity22 are convinced – as i have been for the past 40 years – that part of the solution is in providing more structured activities for young people			1
in my opinion , tragedies such as the murder of @entity19 and @entity20 ’s son are the extreme result of too many young people no longer guided through a rite of passage ; young people who would benefit from the guidance and help of organisations such as the @entity37 , @entity38 , cadets and other youth organisations			1
however , these are all groups which are hampered in their growth by a lack of adult volunteers			1
speaking with @entity19 and @entity20 and members of @entity47 – a group for those parents whose children have been torn away from them and killed in such appallingly brutal ways as a result of gang violence – made me even more determined to start a long - term leadership campaign			0
this would provide many more opportunities for all young people to acquire a sense of constructive purpose , motivation and service , and also build on a collaborative initiative with youth organisations , called @entity62 , that i started four years ago			1
this kind of initiative can help to provide a constructive team - based substitute for destructive gang violence , so that no more families like the @entity22 should have to suffer such untold misery in the future			0
this week at @entity71 , i am joining the leaders of @entity73 , including the prime minister , the deputy prime minister and the @entity76 , plus 50 young people , to launch a pledge campaign called @entity79 through a collaborative youth initiative called @entity81			1
i believe that such a long - term campaign , which is supported by all sectors of society and involving faith and political leaders , education , business , trade unions and the voluntary sector , has a unifying vision			0
that vision is that all of us , from all walks of life , will ‘ step up ’ and pledge , at # iwill , to help young people take every opportunity to be of service to others			1
at present , just 29 per cent volunteer regularly , although more may do so informally			0
the campaign proposes that we should support and inspire 50 per cent of all those aged between ten and 20 to take part in practical action in the service of others by 2020			0
i am so glad that the main political parties and youth organisations and businesses are saying ‘ i will ’			0
i know that young people have an immense contribution to make to our society , but i have long believed we are failing to do enough to unlock their talent and unleash their energies to help tackle all sorts of challenges			2
young people are the solution to so much and yet , too frequently , they are seen as the problem			2
a family torn apart : prince @entity0 , meets with @entity19 and @entity20 during a visit to the @entity121 following the death of their son in the nearly 40 years that i have been supporting youngsters , many of them have told me they also want the chance to put something back and assist their communities			2
if you think that all over our country there are thousands of lonely old people who need company , younger children who need alternatives to hanging about on street corners , crucial environmental work that needs doing , and local causes that need espousing , it is not difficult to see how any small voluntary contribution can help			0
as i travel the length and breadth of our land , i am fortunate enough to see marvellous examples of youth - led social action			0
i am incredibly proud of all the young people i meet who are already engaged in such action because through this experience they can then go on to motivate others			2
in @entity156 last month , i presented members of the first @entity158 in @entity159 with their certificates , and was enormously encouraged to hear of the large numbers who wanted to join through their schools			0
these examples – and countless others – give me hope that we can achieve our goal of @entity81			0
while much is done by young people through their own efforts or through great youth organisations and inspirational teachers , we need them to start volunteering at a younger age , and embed the habit of community involvement in those vital years when they move from primary school to secondary school			1
to do this effectively , we must enlist thousands more adults to support and motivate younger people in their social action , and to encourage those who have already been involved to engage and lead others			0
young people need to be recognised and celebrated for their progress – as the @entity184 does so successfully – and we must develop many more opportunities which stretch and challenge those in their service to others			2
i remember a speech i made in the @entity188 in the early 1970s			0
i spoke about the need for young people to be of service to others , to face challenging situations , and to learn and reflect on that experience			2
i myself was a volunteer coastguard – as well as spending time in the cadet unit when i was at school – and i remember what a difference that made to me at that age			0
some 25 years ago , i set up the @entity201 programme as a pilot community service scheme , and that confirmed to me that volunteering to help others brings immense benefits to young people , as well as to the whole community			1
support : prince @entity0 is joining @entity208 and @entity209 , pictured , in supporting the # iwill campaign , part of the @entity213 initiative the young people learnt social skills , built up their confidence and self - esteem and realised – perhaps for the first time – the contribution they could make to those who needed assistance , and the satisfaction they could feel from service to others			1
in total , 160,000 young people have completed this one programme run by my @entity227 , and thousands more each year clear derelict sites , create community gardens , help disabled children or produce films which warn of the dangers of gun and knife crime			2
helping hand : @entity236 of @entity237 has helped increase the ranks of much - needed @entity38 volunteers during her time as an occasional volunteer for the organisation my trust will double the number of young people volunteering as our pledge to the @entity213 campaign			1
the motivation , commitment and sense of purpose the volunteers develop is truly inspiring and makes me enormously proud of what young people can achieve			1
i am equally encouraged to hear that the @entity253 , established now as a ‘ rite of passage ’ programme for 16 - year - olds , is having the same effect for many young people , and so we now need to develop the journey earlier on in their lives			1
the @entity262 recently reported that employers need young people who are optimistic , determined and emotionally intelligent – and research shows that youngsters who take on challenging volunteer activities have all those character traits and virtues			1
i believe the business world has a vital role to play too , not only by making it clear that it values this in future recruits , but also by actively supporting employees as adult volunteers			1
and so i hope that many companies will pledge at # iwill to support @entity81			1
i need hardly say that i am particularly delighted that my daughter - in - law , the @entity278 , has helped to swell the ranks of much - needed scout volunteers during her time as an occasional volunteer for the organisation , since enrolling many more adults as leaders is the greatest need for so many of our youth groups			0
and in this sense i would hope that we might also build on the wonderful volunteering spirit and the contribution made by so many to the success of last year ’s @entity294			0
i wanted to convene and launch this campaign as i reached my 65th birthday in order to support all those who are engaging young people to say ‘ i will ’ , and to underline the vital contribution youngsters can make with their service to the community			1
on thursday , the campaign will announce and encourage pledges from organisations and individuals all over @entity73			0
i can only hope that @entity307 readers will be moved to consider what their personal contribution to the @entity213 campaign could be and perhaps pledge their support at # iwill			2

death of @entity3 , 16 , inspired the prince to encourage volunteering
believes providing structured activities through organisations such as @entity38 , @entity37 and cadets can help young people through rite of passage
