councils across the @entity2 @entity1 are closing hills and banning sledding to prevent being sued in injury claims			1
it is not known just how many cities have banned or restricted the pass time , but every year the list grows			1
the latest city council to get on board is @entity11 , @entity12 , where they are moving ahead with plans to ban sledding in all but two of its 50 parks			1
councils across the @entity2 @entity1 are closing hills and banning sledding to prevent being sued in injury claims ; the latest council to propose restrictions is in @entity11 , @entity12 , where they are moving ahead with plans to ban sledding in all but two of its 50 parks ( stock image ) @entity25 , @entity11 's leisure services manager , told @entity26 that the council had ' all kinds of parks that have hills on them ' and ca n't ' manage the risk ' at all of the locations			1
more than 20,000 children each year were treated at emergency rooms for sledding - related injuries between 1997 and 2007 , according to a study by @entity39 - based @entity38 at @entity40			1
@entity11 council members had been against the move , but conceded it was necessary given liability concerns and to meet demands from their insurers			1
they had cited two sledding lawsuits			2
one had involved a $ 2 million judgement against @entity50 , @entity51 , after a 5 - year - old girl was paralyzed when she hit a tree , and the other involved a $ 2.75 million payment to a man who injured his spinal cord after hitting a sign			1
instead of out - right bans on sledding , some cities had lessened their liability by banning sledding only on certain slopes and by posting warning signs			2
in 2013 , @entity67 , @entity66 officials removed their sledding hill altogether out of fears sledders may crash into trees			2
the 20 - foot rise was more of a dirt mound - made to cover rubbish and junk metal - but it was often crowded with sledders			0
@entity76 , who runs a website that promotes sledding , said he understands why cities impose restrictions as most sledders do n't wear helmets and it 's near impossible to steer away from obstacles ( stock image ) after losing a lawsuit , @entity50 banned sledding at a popular hill one winter , but later dropped the restriction as people were continuing to sled there			0
the city has now posted warning signs at sledding sights and put pads around posts and hay bales around trees			0
@entity98 , a @entity99 lawyer who represents local governments , told the website that most people realize that cities must restrict potentially dangerous activities to protect their citizens			0
he said previously people may have accepted they were responsible for their own actions , but they now expected the government to prevent dangers whenever possible			0
@entity76 , who runs a website that promotes sledding , said he understands why cities impose restrictions			0
most sledders do n't wear helmets and it 's near impossible to steer away from trees , rocks or signs , he said			0
mr @entity76 said : ' we live in a lawsuit - happy society and cities are just being protective by banning sledding in areas that pose a risk for injury or death			0
