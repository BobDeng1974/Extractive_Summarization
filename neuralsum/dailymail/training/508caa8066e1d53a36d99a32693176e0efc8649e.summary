by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 20:47 est , 19 november 2013 @entity3 : 07:49 est , 20 november 2013 @entity4 is pulling out of @entity5 after its @entity7 owners decided to give up on the chain in the face of repeated losses , putting 200 jobs at risk			1
a closing - down sale is expected to begin on wednesday , with some 44 stores due to disappear by the end of the year			1
@entity4 's miniature stores have become a familiar fixture at train stations and airports since it was founded in 1981 by heel bar owner @entity20			1
glory days : an airport branch of @entity4 is seen in 1999 , when the store was booming vanish : @entity4 is to close 44 stores on the high street following repeated losses			1
it will remain online the explosion of office - based jobs in the @entity32 financial district helped it expand rapidly , reaching a peak of 450 stores during 1998			1
but competition from internet retailers , coupled with high costs , has hit sales hard , while fashions have changed			0
ties , once de rigeur at business meetings , have become regarded as optional accessories , with even the prime minister appearing in open - necked shirts for some speeches and functions			0
changing times : president @entity48 , left , wears a special @entity4 tie to promote @entity51 relation at a summit in 1989			2
right , @entity53 and @entity54 go without ties at a @entity57 conference this year the latest accounts for the business show that it made a loss of £ 6.9million last year , after falling £ 7.4million into the red the previous year			2
mounting losses are understood to have convinced the firm 's @entity7 owner , the @entity66 , to leave @entity5 altogether , retaining only the @entity4 online brand			1
discussions are understood to be ongoing about the possibility of @entity4 maintaining some stores at airports			1
but the last of its @entity74 shops is expected to close by the end of the year , while accountancy firm @entity76 is thought to be seeking a buyer for the overseas branch network			1
the firm 's @entity80 subsidiary will not be affected			1
a spokesman said : ' following a period of prolonged decline in @entity4 ’s fortunes , it is with regret that we announce this closing down sale			2
management are working with staff to provide support during this difficult time			0
' a high street phenomenon , a royal favourite , and the @entity97 ended the @entity98 while in recent years @entity4 may have slumped to just another outlet before @entity101 , the company had an illustrious history that chimes with the boom years of the 1980s , saw the company dabble with royalty , and even take part in efforts to end the @entity98			1
but the retailer , which once boasted 450 outlets nationwide , had a humble beginning			0
according to @entity4 's official history , the idea for a dedicated tie shop was born because its founder was fed up with the queue at @entity116			1
@entity20 , the @entity117 who ran the company for most of its life , had long been a tie enthusiast , but said that quality silk versions were only affordable once a year when the @entity116 sale rolled around			1
the rush for cheap ties , which he compared to ' being caught in a swarm of locusts ' , convinced him there was a market for ' silk ties at prices that would not make people cry '			0
boom times : shoppers queue outside @entity4 on @entity136 2001 mr @entity20 , who owned a shoe - servicing shop on @entity138 , started selling ties as well , put on display draped over shoe racks			1
they sold out on the first day , and later that year the shop was transformed into the original @entity4			1
a year later , the first store opened in a train station at @entity146 , and in 1984 a @entity4 outlet opened at @entity148 , at a time when airports were nationalised and contained very few shops			1
business boomed for years , cropping up in stations airports and high streets all over the country			0
in 1987 mr @entity20 decided to float the business on the stock market , to fund even more rapid expansion			2
when in the shares hit the market in june 1987 , there was £ 1billion worth of applications for just £ 12.5million in shares			0
the huge level of interest - 84 buyers for every single share - was a record at the time			0
@entity169 attention : princess @entity171 opened a @entity172 in 1987 by the end of the year , the retailer had even caught the attention of the @entity176			2
when princess @entity171 was invited to open the @entity179 's shopping centre in @entity180 , north - west @entity181 , she took a moment to cut the ribbon of a new @entity4 , commenting : ' i always like these shops			2
they have such smashing , cheerful colours			0
' she even gained a souvenir from the trip in the form of a pair of silk blue boxer shorts that shop staff noticed caught her eye			0
though there is nothing to suggest prince @entity199 ever donned that particular @entity4 product , he made a point of complimenting their ties at a store opening in 1994 at the @entity205 in @entity206			0
mr @entity20 met the prince at the store - punningly called @entity208 - and recalled him saying : ' you have an awfully large selection of ties here			0
do you know , i would like to buy my ties myself but , of course , i ca n’t			0
' however , the retailer 's greatest contribution to events on the world stage undoubtedly came in the dying days of the @entity98 , when @entity221 president @entity48 wore a symbolic @entity4 number as he ended the long - running conflict between @entity224 and @entity225			2
president @entity226 wore the historic ' @entity228 ' tie on one of the days of the @entity230 in 1989 , which many consider the official end of hostilities between the @entity221 and the @entity234			0
the design was launched a year earlier and sent to president @entity226 , his predecessor @entity236 , and @entity234 leader @entity237 , as well as a host of other prominent figures			0
the @entity228 tie , named after the @entity242 policy of increased openness to the @entity225 , featured the @entity221 and @entity234 flags next to one another , and also sported a white dove , to symbolise peace			0
world stage : president @entity48 , left , is seen wearing @entity4 's @entity228 tie at the @entity230 in december 1989 as part of its drive for peace - and publicity - when @entity4 sent out its @entity228 ties to celebrities , it asked them to send one of theirs in return			2
these were then auctioned off for charity , raising more than £ 100,000 after contributions from @entity262 , @entity263 , @entity264 , @entity265 , as well as two scarves from @entity267			0
the brand peaked in the later 1990s , when it had more than 400 stores worldwide , but began to fall victim to changing styles and increased competition			0
in 1999 , the group went private as @entity7 design house @entity274 bought up 70 per cent of the company 's shares , while the other 30 per cent were retained by mr @entity20 and the company directors			1
@entity280 were in turn bought up to become part of @entity7 conglomerate @entity283 , which owns @entity4 today			1
by 2013 the once - ubiquitous chain had dwindled to just 44 shops , and today the news came that all but the 9 airport stores will definitely close , while even the remaining outlets hang in the balance .			2

some 44 stores will disappear by end of the year following £ 6.9m losses
firm 's @entity7 owner @entity66 will retain @entity4 online brand
