but all that came crashing down after it was discovered that @entity12 was not only unfaithful to her first husband , she 'd married her second while he was still alive			1
the court case that ensued convulsed @entity19 high society and after being roasted in the press and shunned by society , @entity12 fled abroad , never to return			1
notorious : @entity4 's unorthodox living arrangements caused a scandal when they came to light so who was @entity27 's most notorious resident ? born in 1720 , @entity4 was the daughter of colonel @entity28 and counted the children of prime minister sir @entity30 among her childhood companions			1
as a young woman in 1743 , she was appointed maid - of - honour to princess @entity34 , wife of @entity37 , @entity38 , and mother of the future @entity41 the same year , she made a glittering marriage to the @entity44 augustus @entity43 , the future @entity45 but it was n't long before things began to go wrong			1
her marriage was unhappy and by 1744 she had embarked on the first of several affairs - infidelity that eventually led to the couple separating just five years later			1
in the same year , she scandalised society by appearing in public in a flesh - coloured skintight gown that made her appear nude			2
in a book written about her in 1788 , the life and @entity58 of @entity4 , the incident was given pride of place			1
shocking : a plate from @entity63 showing @entity4 and her two husbands spectacular : the @entity67 exhibition also includes artifacts such as this ornate fan wrote the anonymous author : ' it has been asserted this lady appeared [ at a masquerade ] in a shape of flesh - coloured silk so nicely and closely fitted to her body as to produce a perfect review of the unadorned mother of mankind , and that this fair representative of frailty , … had contrived a method of giving as evident tokens of modesty , by binding her loins with a partial covering , or zone , of fig - leaves			1
' the book , which appears in @entity67 exhibition , @entity19 revealed : life , style and the @entity93 , is one of several artifacts charting her scandalous life currently on show in @entity98			0
' she led a very eventful life , ' adds @entity101 , a curator at the @entity67			0
' her love of fine living , particularly jewellery , good food and wine and luxurious surroundings , as well as her enjoyment of publicity and her scandalous private life , made her celebrated			0
stylish citizens : the fashion plates of the day , pictured in the @entity114 's first fashion magazine , @entity115 stylish : @entity117 's 1720 painting , an @entity118 , has been loaned by the @entity119 ' she has much in common with celebrities of the 21st century and would undoubtedly have been the subject of much gossip in today ’s newspapers and magazines			0
' but her most scandalous moment was still to come			0
after separating from her first husband , @entity12 began a relationship with @entity130 , @entity131			1
and in 1769 , she married him after obtaining a legal agreement that stated her first marriage was invalid			2
as she was soon to discover , it was n't			0
when the @entity131 died in 1773 , he left her everything on condition that she remain a widow			2
once again , @entity12 's future seemed assured but it was n't to last			2
@entity144 : @entity146 's @entity145 shows @entity98 's most stylish dancing circa 1817 no sooner had the ink dried on the @entity131 's death certificate , his furious nephew and heir , @entity153 , the first @entity154 , accused @entity12 of bigamy ; a case that soon reached the scandal sheets and the ears of her former boss , princess @entity34			1
' the royal family reacted with complete silence , ' comments @entity101 , ' although it seems likely that @entity4 ’s court links became more tenuous and ceased completely when her bigamous marriage became public knowledge			2
' the @entity19 public , by contrast , lapped up the scandal			0
' the @entity19 loved juicy gossip and controversy – the stuff of the newspapers and magazines that were being published in ever - increasing numbers from the mid- 1700s , ' adds @entity101			0
' @entity4 was a well - known member of the highest society and her behaviour was particularly outrageous – all the more so as she was someone that the middle classes were supposed to look up to			1

humiliated , she fled @entity27 for @entity192 , where she died in 1788 under the name of the countess of @entity195 - the title given to her by her first husband			1
' @entity4 flouted convention both socially and morally and apparently had little regard for public opinion , although she seems to have enjoyed her ill - gotten fame , ' says @entity101			1
' she certainly deserved her notoriety , and she was obviously a fairly self - absorbed woman but there 's something attractive about her zest for life			0
' @entity19 revealed : life , style and the @entity93 runs until the 11th march at the @entity67			0
tickets cost £ 9 for adults and concessions are available			0
along with @entity4 , one of the most notorious women to appear in the @entity67 exhibition is @entity215 , the mistress of @entity216 , 4th @entity217 , and the star of an early tabloid sensation			1
