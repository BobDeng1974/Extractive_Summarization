an aid worker who has seen the deadly effects of the fast - spreading ebola virus in @entity3 says there is ' no reason ' why @entity7 military troops can not join the fight to stop the outbreak			2
@entity7 @entity11 's comments comes after @entity13 deputy leader @entity12 said the government was not doing enough to assist the growing health threat			2
so far @entity17 's efforts to tackle @entity18 is focussed on hospitals and airports as a deal is sought to ensure health workers sent to @entity3 can be quickly evacuated and treated			1
' first , @entity17 does n't need to commit large numbers of military doctors and nurses in order to make a difference			2
' the @entity43 is sending 460 medics to @entity26 in five - week rotations - meaning that over a period of six months there will be no more than 92 medics in country at any one time			1
' these medics are being deployed specifically to train national health workers to run the five new treatment facilities being built			0
' @entity43 medics will not be treating @entity18 patients and will return to the @entity43			1
this approach works because @entity18 is a straightforward virus to treat , requiring basic level health workers who are readily available in @entity26			1
' there is no reason why the @entity62 ca n't take the same approach to the provision of medical care			2
' the disease is spreading fast without the appropriate resources to contain those infected @entity11 ( centre ) seen here at the christening of her god - daughter , said it is impossible to contain @entity18 without expert military medical teams from @entity17 , the @entity43 and the @entity75 ms @entity30 also criticised @entity77 mp @entity77 's reaction to the @entity18 scare in @entity79 involving @entity81 @entity17 volunteer nurse @entity80 last week			1
' how did @entity17 respond ? federal mp @entity77 has accused ms @entity80 of putting @entity17 at risk because of her " humanitarian ambitions " , ' ms @entity30 wrote			1
the federal opposition says the $ 18 million provided by the coalition government to tackle the virus , which is killing thousands of people in west @entity3 , is not enough			0
@entity13 deputy leader @entity12 believes @entity17 should be sending in health workers and other experts to help fight @entity18 , which presents a threat to health and international security			1
prime minister @entity94 said the aid spending , which came on top of $ 40 million for the @entity97 , was a creditable effort so far			0
mr @entity94 thinks it is irresponsible to send in @entity7 personnel without an agreement to fly them out immediately and get them quickly to a high - quality hospital if they contracted the virus			2
in @entity26 there are only 30 beds available for @entity18 patients , so hundreds more are forced to stay at home until people die and free up space in the hospitals ms @entity30 ( centre ) celebrated @entity17 day with fellow countrymen in @entity115 this year ms @entity30 's op - ed comes after the aid worker said the area was completely unprepared to deal with the crisis			1
originally from @entity25 in @entity17 , ms @entity30 has been living in @entity26 for the past two years and has seen first hand the devastation the disease is causing			1
they 're totally under - resourced , ' she told @entity127 last month			0
' patients are getting left in their houses because we just do n't have any room			0
' in the capital city , @entity115 , there are only 30 beds available to those with @entity18 , despite there being thousands of people infected or suspected to have contracted the potentially fatal virus			2
' they 're just waiting for people to die to free up the beds , ' ms @entity30 said			1
ms @entity30 originally moved to @entity115 to work on the women and children 's health policy , but when @entity18 began to spread received a direct request from the minister of health in @entity26 to help fight the disease			1
but she believed the only real way to contain the virus was if @entity17 and other nations sent expert military medical teams to set up field hospitals and isolation centres , two things which @entity115 need so desperately			1
' the only way we have a chance of containing this outbreak is if we deploy military ' , ms @entity30 said before adding that they would be able to accommodate a level of risk humanitarian aid ca n't			1
the aid worker has started a petition which has already garnered over 33,000 signatures , urging foreign minister @entity164 to do more than financially support the situation			0
' i 've never been more devastated in my life			0
last week i returned to @entity25 after working with the health ministry in @entity26 – witnessing first hand how the deadly ebola virus is spiralling out of control and killing hundreds			1
' ' it 's terrifying , and to be honest i 'm not sure anyone knows when or how it 'll end			0
what i saw will stay with me forever – in some places there are n't enough ambulances to pick up those infected or bury the dead , ' ms @entity30 wrote on @entity182			1
the country 's government burial team is seen here carrying the coffin of dr @entity186 , @entity26 's second senior physician to die of @entity18 fellow @entity7 @entity187 ( left ) and @entity43 doctor @entity188 have been fighting alongside ms @entity30 ( centre ) to keep @entity115 's main isolation centre open ms @entity30 said she believed there was hesitation in sending personnel overseas as there was a risk of infection			1
the reality is less than ten aid workers have contracted @entity18 , and if isolation facilities were set up alongside @entity75 and the @entity43 in @entity3 treatment would be incredibly easy			2
ms @entity30 also revealed the wider devastation the spread of @entity18 was having on the community , economy , and already struggling healthcare system			1
people are terrified to visit hospitals , which is having devastating effects on the number of people accessing the health facilites , a problem the region has already been battling with for years			0
' pregnant ladies are giving birth at home , if your baby has malaria you do n't take them to the hospital ' , ms @entity30 revealed			1
' the hospitals are empty beside @entity18 patients			2
' she also told of how tough the struggle was to break down the stigma around accessing healthcare services , and how the disease is quickly unravelling all the hard work			0
one in eight women died during childbirth before the government introduced free healthcare for pregnant women			0
this is worst outbreak of @entity18 the region has ever seen , and the first time it has appeared in such an urban and highly populated area			0
if it is not contained soon , the projection is grim			0
authorities believe it could spread to more than 1.4 million people across the region if urgent and desperately needed help is not received			0
the reason the virus is spreading so quickly is the close communities without standalone houses and the close proximity of marketplaces with many people packed into them allow it to spread with much greater ease			0
' we do n't have that level of contact in @entity17 ... ( and ) we 've got the medical expertise to be able to put in place the correct procedures ' , ms @entity30 said when asked if @entity18 could post a threat to her home country			1
despite the devastating health implications , the aid worker insisted there is much more at stake than the terrible loss of life			0
ms @entity30 ran the @entity26 marathon last year with her mum there to show her support already unstable economies in the region are likely to crumble under the pressure , and this process has already begun already unstable economies in the region are likely to crumble under the pressure , and this process has already begun			1
mining companies completing projects in @entity3 have pulled workers out of the area in fear of @entity18 , and others with ' investments in the pipelines are being disbanded			0
' the disease has already claimed hundreds of lives in countries in the area , and could claim many more if urgent action is not taken , ms @entity30 warned			2
' it can definitely be contained ... if we have beds for suspected or confirmed patients , healthworkers who are able to treat them			0
' unless we have those two things on the ground we do n't stand a chance			0
' more than 700 people have arrived at @entity7 airports from west @entity298 countries since the outbreak			0
the 11 arrivals suspected of @entity18 have all tested negative			0
most of the estimated 4,500 @entity18 cases worldwide have been in @entity303 , @entity26 and @entity304 , but @entity305 , @entity306 , @entity307 and @entity75 have also recorded cases .			2
