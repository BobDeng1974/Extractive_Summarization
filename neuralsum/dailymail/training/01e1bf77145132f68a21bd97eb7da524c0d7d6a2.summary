by @entity0 published : 19:39 est , 5 june 2012 updated : 05:29 est , 6 june 2012 lying in a hospital bed , i watch as a nurse inserts an intravenous drip into my left arm			1
it stings a little , and almost immediately i notice a strong vitamin c taste in my mouth , as if i ’ve been eating oranges			2
as the liquid level in the bag slowly sinks , i start to feel brighter , sharper and my jagged headache softens			2
mixed bag : @entity0 puts an extreme hangover treatment , which involves being attached to an intravenous vitamin drip , to the test after 20 minutes , i look in my hand mirror and notice my bleary , bloodshot eyes have cleared , too			1
despite this , i can not help feeling a little guilty			2
you see , i ’m not being treated for a serious illness — there are certainly no life - saving medicines in the drip			1
i am suffering nothing more serious than a hangover , and am hooked up to what has become known as the ‘ party drip ’ — a cocktail of vitamins designed to act as a quick - fix cure for a heavy night out			1
many deluded devotees view it as a near - magic potion that allows them to binge - drink all night as often as they wish without any ill effects			1
the latest celebrity advocate is pop singer @entity38 , who tweeted a picture of her arm hooked up to a drip last month , after a night of partying			1
though it was reported at the time that she ’d been rushed to hospital after a night of excess , she was actually undergoing a medical procedure that has taken celebrity circles by storm			1
and , after finding a receptive market in @entity51 , the iv drips are becoming increasingly popular in @entity52			1
write caption here but doctors and other experts warn that not only do the drips encourage dangerous levels of alcohol consumption , in the wrong hands they could put patients at risk of a range of side effects , from mild infections to potentially fatal anaphylactic shock ( a severe allergic reaction )			2
so far in @entity52 , the treatment is offered at just a handful of exclusive clinics and health clubs for more than £ 200 a time — but it is attracting a growing client base			1
last year , @entity72 admitted he enjoys a weekly iv drip of @entity74 , magnesium , vitamin c and , he says , ‘ something for your liver ’ — a procedure recommended to him by @entity78			1
‘ when you have it done , it ’s an incredibly warm feeling , ’ he said			2
‘ you feel all the vitamins going through you			1
it ’s calming and gives you energy for a good few days			2
’ when i speak to another convert , air hostess @entity90 , 32 , she admits she uses a ‘ party drip ’ once a month			1
@entity93 : last year , @entity72 admitted he enjoys a weekly iv drip of @entity74 , magnesium , vitamin c and , he says , ¿ something for your liver ¿ ¿ a procedure recommended to him by @entity78 she had her first £ 225 treatment in december at the @entity101 near her home in @entity103 , @entity104			1
‘ i was busy working and socialising in the run - up to @entity106 , ’ she says			2
‘ i was exhausted , run down and hungover , and needed hydrating and a good boost of vitamins to see me through the party season			1
‘ normally , my hangovers last for 24 hours and my headache only starts to recede by the evening of the following day			1
‘ i feel hazy , with glazed eyes , a brain that feels like spaghetti and an inability to concentrate			0
‘ after the drip , i felt as if all the badness had been filtered out and i was clear again			1
' my mind was sharp , the headache gone and i could even go shopping , something i never do the morning after			0
’ far from worrying about the effect her hard - drinking lifestyle might be having on her health , @entity90 sees the drip as her ticket to more partying			1
‘ i need to give my body something back because i take so much out of it , ’ she says			0
‘ i ’m going to @entity135 on a week ’s holiday with friends next month and i ’ve already booked my session for when i get back			1
’ an early advocate of the party drip is @entity142 , 42 , the founder of @entity143 in @entity144 , a clinic that offers a variety of intravenous vitamin infusions			1
she started ‘ dripping ’ in 2000 and still uses them regularly			0
‘ i have trimmed my partying back over the past couple of years , but i used to be out every single night except sunday , ’ she says			1
‘ this year , i was flown out to @entity152 for @entity154 ’s 60th birthday party , which was amazing			1
i also had great fun with @entity72 and @entity156 at @entity154 ’s 59th birthday at @entity159 ’s private dining club in @entity160			1
’ @entity142 claims her body needs help to cope with the fast - paced lifestyle she enjoys — and the party drip offers a perfect solution			1
‘ i gave myself four days of dripping to keep up my stamina for the partying over the jubilee weekend , ’ she says			1
‘ my penthouse by @entity170 overlooks the river , so i was hosting parties non-stop and wanted to look and feel my best			0
’ but dr @entity173 , principal lecturer in human nutrition at @entity175 , says of the drips : ‘ they ’re a load of blithering nonsense			0
people should curb their excesses			0
‘ i am not aware of any studies that show a genuine physiological benefit			0
a celebrity endorsement is not evidence			0
‘ the idea that pumping yourself full of vitamins and minerals is going to redress the balance of an unhealthy lifestyle is a lot of hocus pocus when there is no medical , scientific or clinical research to back it up			1
’ concerns : doctors and other experts warn that not only do the drips encourage dangerous levels of alcohol consumption , in the wrong hands they could put patients at risk of a range of side effects he believes most of the benefit people claim to feel is down to rapid rehydration			0
‘ the clinics are working on the assumption their clients are deficient , ’ he says			0
‘ the other assumption is that an excess of vitamins and minerals has some kind of benefit when , in fact , if you are not deficient in something and are given more of it , it does pretty much nothing except be excreted through your urine			1
’ as for the potential dangers , dr @entity173 says : ‘ if the procedure is done by a qualified medic who knows how to find a vein and uses clean needles , and the contents of the infusion are from a reputable pharmaceutical supplier , there ’s no reason why it should be dangerous			0
‘ what is dangerous is a less than authentic set - up offering the service at a much lower price , maybe cutting corners in the process			0
' people who want to do what the stars are doing , but do n’t have the same money may be tempted into situations that do n’t have high clinical standards			0
there would be all kinds of risks , including infection and anaphylactic shock			0
’ @entity143 and @entity101 , where i try the party drip , use qualified nurses overseen by a doctor			2
@entity260 , professor of health sciences at @entity262 in @entity263 , says : ‘ giving a drip has to be done with care — some people get a fluid overload , which is dangerous			2
‘ also , in rare cases , some vitamin preparations can cause ana - phylactic shock			0
‘ a hangover is never dangerous , but a heavy session of drinking could be			2
if you can not control your drinking , you may need to re-think your relationship to alcohol			0
’ dr @entity278 , a consultant liver specialist at @entity279 , is also scathing about vitamin drips			0
‘ medically , this is useless , ’ he says			0
‘ what worries me is the idea that you can spend now and pay later with your body — you can not abuse alcohol and expect this to work as a quick fix			1
popularity increasing : so far in @entity52 , the treatment is offered at just a handful of exclusive clinics and health clubs for more than £ 200 a time ¿ but it is attracting a growing client base ‘ i work with the @entity294 , and our message is you need to drink in moderation and ideally have three or four alcohol - free days each week			1
no amount of intravenous vitamins can change that			2
’ when i try the party drip , i give it a robust testing			2
i book an appointment at @entity101 and have a heavy night at @entity104 ’s @entity307 the night before			2
i drink two twinkle cocktails — a delicious , but potent mix of champagne , vodka and elderflower liqueur — before four large glasses of white wine and an espresso martini			0
i stagger out at 3am and barely remember the journey home			0
the next day i feel so fragile i ca n’t go to my regular early - morning spin class			0
i feel shocking — headachy , nauseous and filled with an overwhelming sense of doom			0
unable to face breakfast , i head off to @entity101			0
there is a menu of eight drips , which promise to boost your immune system , calm anxiety or speed up metabolism			0
i choose the vitality - booster treatment , a so - called instant ‘ pick - me - up ’ containing vitamin c , b vitamin complex , and the minerals selenium , magnesium , zinc and chromium			2
being hooked up to an iv line is associated with being ill in hospital , so using it to get over a hangover feels utterly wrong			1
the better i feel , however , the less i care			0
an irresponsible attitude , which makes me worry how easily others could become hooked on it			2
the bag takes 30 minutes to empty			0
when i walk out of the spa — whether it is all in my mind or not — i ’m so energised that i power - walk the three miles home			0
i definitely feel better , though that may just be down to a ‘ placebo effect ’ , rehydration and the passage of time			0
and i have to agree with dr @entity278 that this is a dangerous game to play			0
if party drips became part of my routine , i know i would be inclined to treat my body like an amusement park rather than a temple			0
and the price to be paid for that is considerably higher than £ 225 a go .			1
