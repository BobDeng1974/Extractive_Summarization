@entity0 and @entity1 were the late heroes as @entity3 marked the ninth anniversary of their famous victory over @entity6 by grabbing a dramatic 2 - 1 win in their @entity9 opener in @entity10			1
september 7 will always be a special day for @entity3 and ever more so after @entity0 bundled home the scrappiest , most ecstatic finish of his career to give his side a first away success in four long years			1
@entity10 had looked set to take the points on their first outing at the new @entity18 when former @entity20 striker @entity19 headed home a 74th - minute corner			1
winner : @entity0 's 88th minute winner ensured the perfect start for @entity26 victory : @entity26 's side completed an unlikely comeback against @entity10 in their opening qualifier @entity10 ( 3 - 4 - 3 ) : @entity31 ; @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 ; @entity35 ( @entity36 59 ) , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 ; @entity40 ( @entity41 70 ) , @entity42 ( @entity19 46 ) , @entity43			1
booked : @entity32 @entity3 ( 4 - 5 - 1 ) : @entity44 ; @entity45 , @entity46 ( @entity47 72 ) , @entity48 , @entity49 ; @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 ( @entity53 79 ) , @entity54 , @entity55 ( @entity1 79 ) ; @entity0			1
booked : @entity52 referee : @entity57 ( @entity58 ) but @entity60 ’s men ripped up the script as @entity0 ’s brilliant run and pass left @entity1 with the simplest of tap - ins with 10 minutes to go			1
the pair then swapped roles with three minutes left , @entity1 ghosting into the box and crossing for @entity0 , who willed the ball over the line as he tangled with @entity32 and somehow got the job done from the most ungainly position			2
@entity60 sprang a tactical surprise by ditching his favoured 3 - 5 - 2 for something that threatened to be 4 - 3 - 3 but quickly reverted to a more defensive 4 - 5 - 1			1
the biggest gambles appeared to be at full - back , with @entity49 asked to fill in out - of - position on the left of defence and @entity45 handed a first competitive start on the right			2
there were chances at either end inside five minutes , but the finishing on each occasion suggested a goal-fest was never likely			0
equaliser : @entity87 equalised just five minutes after @entity19 had put the hosts in front opener : @entity10 looked in control after @entity93 's opener , but that feeling did n't last @entity0 created the first opportunity , battling to win @entity54 ’s cross and turning the ball deftly for the onrushing @entity55			1
the @entity100 man had time to line up his shot but did not appear to realise it , snatching at the effort and sending it tamely towards @entity31			0
there was more craft in @entity43 ’s attempt at the other end , opening his body to spray a first - time shot towards the far post , but it squirmed wide			0
@entity10 took their time to settle in their new surroundings but gradually began to dictate terms , @entity43 key to everything good and @entity35 giving @entity49 a headache on the right wing			2
the home side were assisted by referee @entity57 , who pulled @entity3 up for a number of barely - there fouls			1
for the visitors , @entity55 ’s terrier - like willingness to scrap for the ball looked the likeliest route			0
group : the other @entity129 teams are @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 and the @entity133 he pick - pocketed @entity33 inside the area only to be challenged before getting his shot away and then made what should have been his crucial intervention			0
he charged down an apparent lost cause on the halfway but got a kind deflection that put him in behind the home defence before sprinting for goal			0
when his shot was pushed out towards the middle of the box , @entity50 should have buried it			0
instead it came a little quicker than expected and sailed high over the crossbar off the midfielder ’s instep			0
@entity50 had been the scorer when @entity3 last won away from home , 1 - 0 in @entity152 four years ago , but there was to be no repeat for him			1
there was a solitary change at the break as @entity158 , once of @entity20 , came on up front for @entity10 , soon to be joined by @entity160			2
it was the latter who drew the first meaningful save of the game from @entity44			0
injury : @entity55 picked up an injury in the second half and @entity26 was forced to replace him that came with 62 minutes on the clock , @entity170 letting fly from the edge of the box and @entity44 diving to his left to touch round the post			2
@entity60 went to bench by necessity , ward and @entity46 both taking knocks before being replaced by @entity1 and @entity47			0
@entity46 ’s presence was surely missed as @entity10 took the lead from a 74th - minute corner , @entity19 getting the critical touch in a packed six - yard box			1
@entity43 whipped in a wonderful set - piece but @entity46 has made a career of making that area his own			0
they might easily have buckled but instead they mustered a grandstand finale			0
managers : @entity26 is hoping to take @entity3 to their first ever @entity193 championships huge credit goes to @entity0 for the leveller , coming deep for the ball before navigating a roundabout way past the @entity10 backline			1
when he opened his legs he quickly found a route into the penalty box , skipping one final challenge before measuring a pass across goal for @entity1 to tap home unmarked			0
a point would have been a decent return on their day ’s work but @entity1 had other ideas , collecting @entity50 ’ clever pass and looking for @entity0 at the back post			2
the finish was hardly elegant but for @entity3 it could not have been sweeter .			2

@entity26 's side beat @entity10 2 - 1 , their first away win in four years
@entity19 scored a second - half header
@entity87 equalised
@entity0 scored a late winner
@entity3 have never been to the @entity224
