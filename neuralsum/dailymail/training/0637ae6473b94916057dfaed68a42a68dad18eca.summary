by @entity0 published : 12:42 est , 17 march 2014 updated : 15:18 est , 17 march 2014 frustrated : @entity2 told his mother he was fed up with doing homework , so decided to write a letter to @entity6 schoolboy @entity2 , 10 , was so angry about having to do school work after class , he told his mother he wanted to write to the prime minister			1
but when he received a reply , it seemed @entity6 's staff had not done enough homework themselves , as the date on the correspondence was wrong			1
@entity2 , of @entity17 , @entity18 , explained to his mother he 'd ' had enough ' of homework and penned a note to the pm in the hope he would take action			1
the response was signed by @entity24 , a 10 downing street correspondence officer			2
it stresses the need to be ‘ well organised ’ - despite the fact the date was wrong by 12 months - stating it was 2013 rather than 2014			1
he wrote : ' dear mr @entity6 , i am writing to ask if you will change the law so children do n't have to do homework , especially on a friday			2
' i work really hard at school every day and think that when i get home it should be my time to play with friends and chill out			1
@entity2 , 10 , from @entity17			1
' @entity2 ’s mother , @entity40 , said while her son was thrilled to get a letter back in february			1
he was not pleased that @entity6 could not help stop him having to do homework			2
miss @entity40 , a pr manager , said : ' every friday he gets sent home with homework and it really grates on him			0
he hates doing homework because he thinks home time is his time to play			0
' he says he gets worked hard enough at school so one day he came home and said , " @entity52 , i ’ve had enough of this			1
i ’m going to write to the prime minister "			0
' it ’s given @entity2 a real lift and has helped make him understand how important homework is			2

it stresses the need to be ' well organised ' - despite getting the date wrong by twelve months ' i would n’t say he ’s absolutely delighted about it , but he does crack on with it now			0

' it also said that mr @entity6 would want @entity2 to do well in his future studies			1
@entity2 was delighted he got an official letter			2
' ' his father and i did n't help with the letter at all , he just sat and wrote a letter asking mr @entity6 to change the law so that children did n't have to do homework any more			2
' if he could get to the @entity90 and speak out himself i 'm certain he would do it			0
it 's clearly a subject he 's passionate about and he 's always been a very confident child			0

' he still does n't like doing his homework			0
but he has n't been complaining as much just recently about it			0
' respite : he claimed that he works very hard during the day and should be able to play and ' chill out ' with his friends when he gets home action : the schoolboy wanted @entity6 to raise the issue of homework in the commons			1

@entity2 from @entity17 told his mother he 'd ' had enough '
he penned a letter to @entity6 and was *surprised* to see a reply
said he works hard during the day and should have respite after school
was *shocked* to receive a reply , but date on correspondence said it was 2013 rather than 2014
