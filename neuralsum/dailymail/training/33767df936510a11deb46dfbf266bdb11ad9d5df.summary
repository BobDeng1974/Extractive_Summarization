a woman has made it her mission in life to find out why her beloved dad died of a heart attack when he was just 30 years old after a routine operation			1
@entity7 , 38 , a nurse who grew up in @entity8 , has spent her life investigating the case of her dad @entity12 's death at @entity13 in 1978			1
@entity15 's @entity14 carried an exclusive report on ms @entity7 's journey to have her questions answered - she believes her dad died after being given @entity20 or clinical name aprotinin to stop bleeding after he was in a car accident			1
mr @entity12 was in the front seat of his friend 's car when it hit another car , he hit his head on the dashboard but doctors initially missed a tear in his bowel and he had lost a lot of blood			2
during the operation the father - of - five was given @entity20 , despite the operation being apparently a success he died the next morning from a heart attack			2
mr @entity12 's widow @entity50 told sunday night she always wondered why her 30 - year - old husband died from the operation			1
ms @entity7 said : ' @entity52 says he was the best man in the world and she has never met anyone in the world like him			2
' he was a skinny little @entity56 man , lots of nice little curls , he was a hard worker and he loved all of us kids			0
' @entity12 married @entity50 and the happy couple settled in @entity8 and planned for a large family @entity50 28 and pregnant with her fifth child when her husband died mrs @entity7 describes her husband as a ' rascal ' adding ' he was a wonderful dad , the children worshipped him and found every excuse to be out there in his company '			2
it was n't until ms @entity7 obtained her father 's medical records when she was 17 by @entity73 did she start to try and uncover why he died			1
in 2011 surgeon @entity74 , who works for the same hospital as ms @entity7 , looked over mr @entity12 's notes and saw that he had been given @entity20			1
he says he believes the drug caused a clot that caused the heart attack			1
on january 26 2006 a report into @entity20 by @entity81 was published and it suggested the drug may increase the risk of serious side effects among patients			0
the @entity86 ( @entity86 ) describes patients suffering from kidney damage , heart attack and stroke patients			0
the @entity86 said the ' major strength ' of the study was the amount of people tested in the trial but there were negative factors because ' patients were not randomly assigned to any of the treatments for preventing bleeding '			0
ms @entity7 believes her dad died because he was given @entity20 during a bowel operation after a car accident @entity20 was owned by @entity104 and it is now under the control of @entity107 it said : ' the study outcomes may not truly indicate @entity20 side effects			1
' two observational studies suggested that @entity20 use may increase the risk for kidney damage compared to other drugs			0
in september 2006 the @entity86 then held another @entity115 which focused on kidney damage as well as patients with serious allergic reactions to @entity20			0
the @entity86 then said @entity20 's recommendation should be changed to say it should only be used in patients at high risk of bleeding from cardiac arrest and that the labels should be changed to include warnings of hypersensitivity and kidney damage			0
in september 2006 it emerged @entity104 had commissioned its own trial and its preliminary data suggested @entity20 increased the risk for in - hospital death in cardiac surgery patients â€™ which was discussed at a @entity86 press conference in 2007			2
in september 2007 the @entity86 @entity115 carried out another trial into mortality risks the past two studies had suggested			0
ms @entity7 , 38 , has dedicated her life to investigating what happened to her dad and why he died aged 30 ms @entity7 says the lives of her brothers and sisters were shattered when their father died the @entity86 said : ' @entity142 did n't find the results compelling enough to warrant a withdrawal so the @entity142 recommended more study			1
' a randomized control clinical trial in @entity147 then commenced but it was halted because @entity20 appeared to increase the risk for death compared with two other drugs			0
following those results the @entity86 requested that @entity104 suspend distribution of @entity20 , which it did			0
ms @entity7 travelled to @entity154 in @entity155 to face up to the @entity104 shareholder 's board and after giving her points she was met with no comment from the chairman			2
she then said : ' how come you ca n't talk about an intravenous drug that killed my dad and i will keep on talking over you so just stop			1
' she was applauded by the audience before being escorted off the premise by security guards			0
ms @entity7 believes her dad died because he was given @entity20 by doctors ms @entity7 travelled to @entity155 to confront drug company @entity104 and ask them her questions @entity20 is now owned by @entity107 in @entity171 and they said discussions are taking place to reintroduce @entity20 to @entity174			1
a @entity178 told sunday night : ' @entity179 ( @entity180 ) for @entity181 of the @entity182 ( @entity182 ) has undertaken an extensive assessment of all available clinical data on aprotinin ... this included clinical studies , published literature , spontaneous reports of side effects and data from manufactures			0
uspend distribution of @entity20 @entity104 suspended the distribution of @entity20 in 2007 but the new owners @entity107 are in talks to see the drug reintroduced ms @entity7 got her voice heard at the @entity195 and still grieves for the father she never knew ' the @entity180 concluded that the benefits of aprotinin outweigh its risk in appropriately managed patients undergoing isolated heart bypass surgery ( not combined with other heart surgery ) , and recommended that the suspension of aprotinin medicines in the @entity205 be lifted for this revised indication			1
' the @entity13 told sunday night : ' the staff at the @entity13 provided mr @entity12 with the best medical care available following his accident in 1978			1
' the medical care given to any patient is guided by the best clinical evidence available at the time			0
through research and clinical trials , new medical care and treatments are development , as was the case with the @entity20 in the 1970s for the treatment of trauma			0

@entity7 believes her dad @entity12 died of a heart attack at age 30 because he was given @entity20
one *expert* says mr @entity12 died because the drug caused clotting in his blood which led to the heart attack , it was supposed to stop bleeding
the 38 - year - old became a nurse and obtained her dad 's medical records when she was 17 to try and find out why he died
sunday night 's investigation sees ms @entity7 go to @entity195 of *pharmaceutical* giant @entity104 who manufactured the drug and come face to face with the shareholders
