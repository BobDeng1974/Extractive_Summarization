the weather and conditions could hardly have been more different , but @entity2 continued on from his @entity4 thrashing of @entity5 earlier this month			1
having beaten the world no 44 earlier this month indoors in @entity7 , he did so again outside in the steaming humidity of the @entity9 to reach the third round			0
@entity2 emerged the 6 - 4 , 6 - 2 winner after an hour and 22 minutes and was left awaiting either @entity13 's @entity12 or @entity15 @entity14			1
@entity2 cruised past @entity16 @entity5 during the second round of the @entity9 the @entity19 no 1 won in straight sets in the soaring heat as he booked his place in the next round @entity2 was largely untroubled by @entity5 who struggled to force the @entity25 into unforced errors it was a comprehensive enough performance , although there was the odd lapse of concentration against a player whose own level tends to undulate sharply			1
@entity2 raced to a 4 - 0 lead but was cut back to 5 - 4 as he briefly struggled with his movement			2
in these heavy and windy conditions he was too solid for the @entity16 left hander and ultimately cruised through after having to fend off break points in the fourth game of the second set			0
@entity2 said after the match that he was pleased with his performance and , in particular , the way he handled the windy conditions			2
@entity2 and @entity5 shake hands after the straight sets win to put the @entity25 into the third round @entity2 , who now plays hard hitting @entity13 baseliner @entity12 , said afterwards : ' i 've played well against him the last couple of times			1
' obviously today was a very different match to @entity4 ; completely different conditions , the tactics that you go into the match with completely change because of the weather and the wind			0
the wind obviously cooled you down a little bit when you were at the end changes			0
sometimes it can be ridiculously hot , and that makes managing the points and your emotions important			0
so i just tried to play smart , and it worked			0
' @entity2 was in high spirits throughout the match and it showed in his high - tempo style of play @entity69 ( right ) watches during his straight sets victory as he protects herself from the soaring heat			1

@entity2 won in straight sets 6 - 4 , 6 - 2 against @entity5 in @entity74
the @entity19 no 1 *sealed* his place in the third round of the *tournament*
@entity2 was pleased with his performance despite the difficult conditions
