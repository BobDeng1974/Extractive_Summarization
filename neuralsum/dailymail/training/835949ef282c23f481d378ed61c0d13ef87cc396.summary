by @entity0 last updated at 7:10 am on 17th february 2012 defiant : former @entity2 president @entity1 leaves @entity3 where he is claiming £ 50,000 in damages against the organisation in his heyday , @entity1 ruled the @entity2 like a king			1
but yesterday the 74 - year - old turned against his former kingdom by taking the union to court in a battle over thousands of pounds in unpaid bills and benefits			1
mr @entity1 is claiming up to £ 50,000 damages in a case that could cost the union ’s @entity17 as much as £ 80,000 if he wins			1
and it was clear from a typically combative performance in the witness box at @entity3 that time has not changed the former union firebrand in his determination to fight to the end for his ‘ rights ’			2
mr @entity1 , who ended his reign as union president 10 years ago , claims the union should pay all his home and mobile phone bills as well as £ 14,556 towards the cost of a new car			1
he has hired a leading qc and is also asking for his costs to be paid by the union			2
but as it was in the famous miners dispute of the 1980s , the two sides remain miles apart , with his union employers offering to pay their former leader just £ 50 for a car			2
after resigning as @entity2 president in 2002 , mr @entity1 became a paid employee of the @entity43 in a contract which ended in december 2011			1
the court battle centres on the terms of this lower grade job and work he did or did n’t do			0
giving evidence in a dark suit and red tie , mr @entity1 implied he received a £ 26,000 - a - year salary for the trust job and worked more than eight hours a day for six days a week on important compensation and legal casework on behalf of members			2
combative : mr @entity1 ( centre ) leads protesters through @entity59 at the height of the miners ' strike in 1984 he said : ‘ most people who know me say i undertook more hours than any other official in history			0
’ however , the court heard two of the trustees were unaware he was working for the fund and for months at a time mr @entity1 was said to do no work at all			2
bizarrely , the terms and conditions of his employment as a union trust fund official were set out in writing when mr @entity1 was still union president			1
@entity75 , for the trust fund , suggested to mr @entity1 the important document was a ‘ letter to you and from you			1
’ mr @entity1 denied authorising his own job terms and insisted : ‘ it would have been a conflict of interest for me to do my own contract of employment			0
’ he said the task was handed to the vice-president and union solicitors instead			2
industrial action : @entity1 ( centre ) addresses the media during the coal miners ' strike of 1992 in protest at @entity94 plans to close 40 per cent of @entity96 's mines discussing his workload as a trust official , the court heard there were 58 ‘ cases or issues ’ he handled in a three - year period from june 2007			1
however , some of these jobs detailed in a written log by mr @entity1 involved little work			0
one task he listed as a union job involved him signing five books , the court heard			0
there was a four - month period in 2008 when he did no work at all , according to the list			0
mr @entity75 told the claimant : ‘ there were large periods of time when you undertook no work at all on behalf of the @entity43			0
’ from 2004 onwards , he never attended a single trust meeting and the minutes of the meetings never discussed any of the work he had done , the court heard			0
mr @entity75 told him : ‘ if you really were conducting any of this terribly important and terribly substantial work in the course of your employment , it ’s surprising there is no reference to that work over this period of years			0
’ however , the former union leader , who was earning £ 70,000 a year as president , denied any suggestion that he had a small workload			1
he insisted he was entitled to a car allowance from the union in intervals of not less than two years			0
the county court case being heard by judge @entity144 is just the first stage in an ongoing legal battle with the @entity2 mr @entity1 is in dispute over the payment of £ 34,000 annual rent on a £ 1.5 million apartment in @entity153 ’s upmarket @entity152 development , which the former leader claims he is guaranteed for life			1
another court hearing is also due to take place in @entity153 later this year over other union benefits allegedly owed to mr @entity1 , including the cost of an alarm at his home in @entity162 , accountancy fees and his fuel allowance			1
it was clear that mr @entity1 has lost none of his belligerence and repeatedly stood his ground in the face of questioning by the trust fund ’s barrister			1
an exasperated mr @entity75 said to him during the middle of one question and answer session : ‘ you telling me i have answered the question is not actually the same as answering the question			0
’ the case continues .			0

action could cost union 's trust fund £ 80,000 if he wins
