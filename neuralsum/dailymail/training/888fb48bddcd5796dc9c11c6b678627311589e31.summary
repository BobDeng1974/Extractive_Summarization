despite having a fine strike force with the likes of @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 , @entity0 had been keen on bolstering their front line with striker @entity7			1
but @entity8 at the bottom of the @entity10 are desperate to find a striker to fire them to safety			1
@entity15 's @entity14 gives you the lowdown on the 23 - year - old from @entity19			1
typical @entity0 , eh ? quick out of the blocks when the market opens , signing reinforcements up front			2
it 's true , they were close to signing @entity26 international striker @entity7 for a fee thought to be around £ 8million			1
the deal is not to go ahead this week after being complicated by @entity29 , which would prevent him from being loaned to @entity8 immediately as he was not intended to go into @entity32 's squad this season			2
the move stalled as the club wanted him to move immediately out on loan as soon as he completes the transfer to @entity39 but @entity0 failed to guarantee he would return to west @entity41 at the end of the season , too			1
@entity45 striker @entity7 is in @entity41 to discuss a move to @entity0 or @entity8 @entity0 had planned to loan @entity7 to @entity8 , here 's why they ca n't ... @entity29 ' a temporary transfer to a @entity49 may not take place in the @entity51 in which the @entity49 acquired the @entity53 's registration			1
' this @entity55 rule wrecked the plan for @entity0 to sign @entity7 from @entity19 then loan him to @entity8 and complicated the move			1
but the rule only covers loan deals between @entity55 clubs			0
it would not have stopped @entity0 signing @entity7 and then loaning him abroad , as they did with @entity61 last january			1
@entity0 now seem to have backed out of the deal altogether , leaving @entity8 to pick up negotiations to sign him permanently			1
to @entity8 ? @entity10 's bottom side has joined the chase yes they are in talks , and @entity69 have expressed an interest along with various big clubs around @entity72			2
apparently , @entity8 offered a bigger fee than @entity0 but once @entity0 were interested @entity7 made up his mind that he wanted to move there and agreed personal terms			1
there seemed to be a compromise plan hatched to let him join @entity8 on loan from @entity0 for the rest of the season but this is no longer possible			1
he did not want to spend his time on loan elsewhere next season , either			0
as the @entity0 move has stalled , @entity8 are now exploring the possibility of offering extra bonus payments to entice @entity7 to them despite their precarious position but would n't loan him out			1
@entity26 has been in the @entity91 since july 2013 but are still subject to work permit regulations			0
this should not stop an international footballer , who would be classed as ' highly skilled ' by the @entity95 , but there will be hoops to jump through			0
if he does sign for @entity0 , @entity7 could move on loan abroad , possibly to @entity99 , in @entity100			1
@entity7 , in action against @entity102 for @entity26 , could be lining up for @entity0 or @entity8 in the @entity10 do n't they have a special connection to @entity0 ? they do have a very close relationship and like to reward each other with favours			1
three @entity0 players are already on loan there : @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 , who has impressed as a centre - forward this season but has recently joined up with @entity114 ahead of the @entity115			1
@entity99 would love to acquire @entity116 to help them cope without @entity111			0
@entity118 were also interested after he scored three against them in the @entity120			0
@entity99 seemed to be the favourites a few days ago but ceo @entity122 said this weekend that they were no longer sure of signing him , either			0
@entity124 are the latest name linked to @entity7			2
it appears to be a transfer cluttered and confused by lots of agents			0
the 23 - year - old has managed to score 28 goals for @entity19 so far this season in the @entity45 @entity133 why all the fuss ? the goals : he has 28 in 31 games in all competitions this season for his club @entity19			1
he represented @entity26 at all youth levels ( he won 53 caps through the age levels ) and has four senior caps ( two goals ) since his debut in august			0
but there are doubts about his quality at the highest level			0
@entity7 is 23 , so no longer a kid fresh from his @entity152			2
he emerged through the ranks to great acclaim at @entity155 , but was unable to establish himself at @entity26 's biggest club			0
he enjoyed a prolific spell on loan at @entity159 but when he returned to @entity155 again failed to break into the team and left under a cloud to join @entity19 in 2013			2
immediately , he hit goal form again			0
he scored 27 last year , winning the @entity163 and is getting better			2
he helped @entity19 beat his former club @entity155 to win the @entity165 and scored five in one game against @entity159			1
so he could be the next @entity167 ? or the next @entity168 ? doubts remain about his ability to play up top			0
does he have the mental strength to perform at a big club , under pressure ? lots of clubs have watched him			0
he is a right - footed centre - forward but not a target man			0
he is technically adept , finds space in the penalty box and threatens goal			0
he is mobile but not keen to run behind defences into the channels			0
instead , he prefers to move towards the ball , link - up play and then time his runs into the box			0
@entity26 boss @entity187 compared him to former @entity188 and @entity189 striker @entity167 , but some @entity191 clubs who have watched @entity7 closely and concluded he might be better suited to the more precise football played in @entity102 , @entity194 or @entity100 .			2

striker @entity7 has been in talks with @entity8 and @entity0
@entity7 wants to sign for @entity0 but an £ 8m move has stalled
23 - year - old has scored 28 goals for his club @entity19 so far this season
