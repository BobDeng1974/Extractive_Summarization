by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 2 march 2013 updated : 17:43 est , 2 march 2013 bald truth : tv presenter @entity2 today the facade , when seen from the front at least , was immaculate – ageless even			1
pop around the back , though , and the view was , some might say , in dire need of repairs			0
@entity11 host @entity2 is as well known for his ‘ big hair ’ as he is for his eye for a bargain			1
the highlights may have become subtler since he presented @entity16 in the @entity17 , but the hairsprayed bouffant remained immovable			0
however , the 49 - year - old has been hiding something from his two million viewers : a large bald patch on his crown			1
and , not one to shy away from renovation work , last november @entity2 secretly underwent a hair - transplant operation			1
the father of two , who later this year celebrates a decade of presenting the series , joined celebrities such as @entity29 and @entity30 in opting for a surgical solution to overcome hair loss			1
last year , almost 300,000 of these operations took place – and 83 per cent of patients were men			1
the boom is in part due to how common hair loss is : a quarter of men are balding by the age of 30			1
yet @entity2 admits the big reveal – as it ’s known in the home makeover business – is yet to come			1
it can take up to a year for transplanted hair follicles to spring to life , which is why the back of his head looks pretty much the same as it did before the £ 12,000 procedure			1
and in that time , as our pictures show , he is left wondering : has it worked at all ? ‘ i think i ’m holding up reasonably well for my age , ’ @entity2 says			1
‘ but a few years ago , i went for a trim and when the hairdresser held up a mirror , i noticed a visible patch of scalp			0
’ worse was to come			0
‘ since then , i ’ve been aware of it much more when i ’ve been doing the show , ’ he continues			0
‘ whenever i saw myself turn around on camera , i really noticed i was balding			2
’ those who experience hair loss earlier in life might consider a man nearing 50 lucky to still have most of his			2
but @entity2 was n’t happy			1
‘ my hairstyle has become a bit of a trademark			0
when i ’m in the supermarket and have n’t done my hair , no one knows who i am			2
suddenly i had to consider asking the cameraman to be careful how he shoots me			0
’ a-head of the game : before and after the painstaking £ 12,000 hair transplant surgery @entity2 , who lives near @entity79 with his wife @entity80 , 44 , and their two children , had the treatment at the @entity84 in @entity85			1
the clinic is run by leading transplant surgeon @entity87 , who approached @entity2 after noticing his bald patch on the show			1
the technique dr @entity87 opted for – follicular unit extraction – involved transplanting 4,200 individual hairs from the back of the head to the crown in a procedure spread over two days			0
‘ i was n’t sure about it right up to the last minute , ’ says @entity2			1
‘ with any medical procedure where injections are given and incisions are made , there are risks			0
it was all explained to me but i was still nervous			0
in the end , it was n’t painful , as the scalp is completely anaesthetised			0
the staff even had @entity11 on the tv while they were doing the procedure			0
’ dr @entity87 says : ‘ there is minimal bleeding			0
the hair itself falls out within a few weeks but the root remains in place			2
after six months , new hair will start to appear but it can take up to a year for some people to really notice a difference			2
the success rate in terms of healthy new growth is 90 to 95 per cent			2
’ even the best surgeons admit up to 15 per cent of transplanted follicles fail to grow			2
as well as transplanted hair going into shock and falling out , so too can existing hair			2
men can also continue to lose hair after a transplant – so , over time , they may require more than one operation			1
however , there is a limit to how many transplants a person can have			0
‘ we have 100,000 hairs on our head and we can move up to 7,000 hairs in one operation and up to 25,000 over a lifetime , ’ says dr @entity141 , of the @entity142			0
head start : @entity2 with fellow @entity11 presenter @entity145 after the operation , men have to sleep sitting up so the newly sewn roots do not get dislodged , and they are advised to avoid washing their hair for a week , because roots need to develop a healthy new blood supply			1
five per cent of patients experience complications , including scarring , rashes and bleeding bumps			2
for every success , there is evidence of high - profile failures : @entity161 and @entity162 are both rumoured to have undergone hair transplants and are still balding			1
but finding solid statistics on failure rates is impossible			0
‘ clinics would never disclose such a thing as an unsatisfied patient , ’ explains consumer champion @entity166 , who runs the hair - loss advice website spexhair.co.uk			1
he underwent five hair transplants – at a cost of £ 33,000 – before finally getting a good result			1
‘ clinics prey on the vulnerable , ’ he adds			0
‘ in my experience , patients often end up disappointed , especially in @entity177			0
@entity177 transplant clinics are not highly regarded – that is why so many men travel to @entity181 and @entity182 instead			1
failure is rife and i would say 50 per cent of men who come to me for advice are seeking repairs after having work done in @entity177			1
often they say there were rushed into a decision			0
’ @entity166 hears from men who had outdated procedures , have unnatural - looking hair growth or little growth at all , or scarring in the transplanted area ‘ to the point where the patient is disfigured ’			1
he also claims celebrities such as @entity2 often add to the confusion : ‘ i have heard from men who have visited surgeons with high - profile clients and had disastrous results , ’ he says			1
‘ maybe the celebrities – who often get their operation for free in return for agreeing to publicity – were just fortunate , or maybe they got better treatment			0
who knows ? ’ @entity2 admits he did not pay for his procedure but says he would have			1
despite the concerns , demand continues unabated			0
dr @entity87 says : ‘ there has been a 25 per cent increase in demand in the past two to three years			2
one reason is there are clear psychological benefits for some men			2
i often see men who are depressed and anxious because of their hair loss			1
’ join the club : footballer @entity29 , pictured with wife @entity224 , has also had a hair transplant a 2005 study in @entity227 looked at how hair loss affected psychological wellbeing			1
researchers quizzed 1,500 men and found that two - thirds of those who had hair loss suffered a drop in self - confidence			1
@entity2 believes the operation was worth it			1
‘ lots of blokes will happily spend £ 12,000 on a car but not on their bodies			1
it ’s crazy that a man should feel embarrassed about having a transplant			2
’ only those closest to him have been informed – until now			0
the only visible sign after surgery was the short growth at the back of the head that was shaved to remove the follicles for transplant			2
@entity2 admits he would be ‘ a bit annoyed ’ if his hair failed to improve , but says he remains ‘ optimistic ’			1
he adds : ‘ in the photos i think i can see new hair growing			2
will it end up being a full bushy head of hair ? only time will tell			2
’ @entity260 the current gold standard procedures of hair restoration surgery are ultra-refined follicular unit transplant ( @entity264 ) , and follicular unit extraction ( @entity266 )			1
a single root produces one hair , but roots are found in clusters of two , three or four , which share blood supply and essential glands			2
this is a follicular unit			0
@entity264 involves taking skin from the back of the scalp and , under a microscope , dissecting the follicular units before implanting them at angles in tiny incisions in the area that is balding.preserving the follicular unit and its blood supply gives a more natural appearance and increases survival rates of grafts			0
the term ‘ ultra-refined ’ refers to how densely packed the grafts are – about 45 hairs per square centimetre			0
@entity266 involves using a small drill to remove intact follicular units directly from the scalp			0
it is a more lengthy and technical difficult procedure , and can cost more			0
although cheaper than @entity266 , the disadvantage of the fut procedure is a thin but potentially noticeable scar across the back of the head			0
‘ for patients who are over 40 and do n’t wear their hair very short , i recommend fut as it ’s quicker , less expensive , and the scar is easily hidden , ’ explains dr @entity141			2
‘ in a younger patient , where future hair loss is difficult to predict , @entity266 is often preferable			0
it is more expensive but the scarring is scattered over the back of the scalp			0
’ reputable clinics should be registered with the @entity313			0
dr @entity141 says : ‘ last year , about two per cent of patients were unhappy with the results of their surgery after 12 months – usually with the amount of hair regrowth – according to our audits			1
any surgeon who ca n’t instantly tell you their figure either does n’t know , which goes against @entity313 recommendations , or they do n’t want to tell you the truth			0
