by @entity0 for the @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 @entity3 scraped into the group stage of the @entity5 on a night of high anxiety at the @entity7 that saw @entity8 open his @entity10 account			1
@entity12 's team missed a succession of chances to put the qualifier beyond the reach of @entity17 following a goalless draw in the first leg in @entity20 , with a 1 - 0 win putting @entity3 through			1
@entity8 , @entity22 and @entity23 failed to score when it was harder to miss amid the mayhem of a roller - coaster second half in which @entity27 was sent off for collecting a second yellow card			1
here , @entity0 gives his verdict on the performance of the players			2
booked for time - wasting			2
@entity27 : fluent as ever in attack and unreliable in defence			1
good interception to deny @entity42			2
booked for a needless shoulder barge and sent off for halting a @entity17 counter-attack			2
@entity45 : his presence and experience brings composure to the @entity3 back - four			1
they played deeper with him in control but @entity42 was not the threat he was in @entity20			2
red card : @entity3 's @entity27 ( right ) is sent off by referee @entity53 @entity54 : generally adds mobility and extra snap in the tackle			1
aggressive and spirited and good chemistry with @entity45			0
@entity59 : a concern for @entity3 in the absence of @entity62 but very solid in defence			1
offered little protection by @entity65			0
@entity66 : aggressive and committed but without the assurance of @entity68			0
prone to conceding free - kicks in dangerous areas			0
slip almost lets in @entity42 in the second half			0
assured : @entity59 ( right ) was solid in defence against @entity17 on wednesday @entity23 : adds energy and urgency to @entity3			1
missed good chance to make it 2 - 0			0
@entity22 : quiet by his standards playing in a more central role			0
rarely on the ball in the most dangerous areas and enjoyed best spell after @entity3 went to down 10			1
@entity82 : influential if erratic			0
slid a good chance wide early on and escaped a penalty for a challenge on @entity86			0
key role in the goal and the one who offered drive from midfield			2
erratic : @entity82 ( right ) had a key role in goal but was lucky not to give away a penalty @entity65 : nice touches , as always , including a role in the goal , but infuriating at times			2
playing wide exposes his deficiencies in defence			0
@entity8 : his first @entity3 goal was precious			1
but he does not look like the answer at centre - forward in @entity109 â€™s absence			1
@entity110 : chambers for @entity65 ( 76mins ) booked for coming on in the wrong fashion as @entity12 restructured after going to 10 men			0
unused : @entity115 , @entity114 , @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119			0
@entity120 : not vintage @entity3 by any means but without captain @entity68 and the main sources of goals , @entity126 and @entity109 , his team got the job done , which was the main thing			1
job done : @entity3 boss @entity12 endured an anxious night at the @entity7 @entity17 : @entity130 6 ; @entity131 6 , @entity132 6 , @entity133 6.5 , @entity134 6 ; @entity135 6.5 , @entity136 5 , @entity137 7 ( @entity138 76 , 5 ) ; @entity139 5.5 ( @entity140 87 ) , @entity42 5.5 , @entity141 6 ( tore , 60 , 5 )			1
@entity110 : @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145			0
@entity146 : @entity147 , @entity136 , @entity132 , @entity135 , @entity138 , @entity148			0
@entity150 : @entity53 : it was an unruly affair with lots of robust midfield challenges simmering tension			0
he booked six @entity17 players and perfectly entitled to send off @entity27 but he made mistakes , including two strong penalty calls by the visitors			1

@entity8 's first goal for @entity3 was precious
*injury* @entity109 leaves @entity10 short of *options*
@entity27 's *dismissal* could have been *costly*
