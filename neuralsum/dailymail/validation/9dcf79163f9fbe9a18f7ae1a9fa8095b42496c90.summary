@entity1 chiefs have warned fans not to buy tickets from unofficial sources after it emerged that a single ticket for the final is being advertised for £ 59,000			1
the category a ticket , which has a face value of £ 715 , is up for sale on a secondary ticket website , @entity12 , for 82 times its original price			1
the site also has category @entity16 tickets for the final at @entity19 on october 31 which originally cost £ 125 for sale for £ 7,500 , some 60 times the face value			1
@entity22 , chief executive of @entity23 , said organisers hoped new legislation forcing secondary websites to publish the exact row and seat number would prove a deterrent - people buying tickets from unofficial sources can be refused entrance			1
@entity1 chiefs have warned fans not to buy tickets from unofficial sources ahead of the tournament @entity22 said : ' our message is to buy those tickets through the official sources - not least to ensure that it is a genuine ticket and not a fraudulent one , and to ensure fans are not ripped off			1
' the new legislation means secondary ticket websites will have to show the row , the seat and access of that ticket			1
that brings greater transparency which will allow us to have more exposure to who is selling those tickets and at what price			2
' we will be monitoring these sites , this gives us the ability to do so to a greater degree and we do reserve the right to refuse access			0
one ticket on @entity12 for the showpiece final has been advertised for sale at a price of £ 59,000 ' our terms and conditions reserve the right not to allow access if that ticket is sold through an unofficial source			1
' we have the ability to track the tickets down			0
' @entity70 did not respond when asked to comment			2
meanwhile , @entity22 said the success of the @entity1 , which is being hosted by @entity23 in the autumn with some matches in @entity74 , will not depend on whether @entity76 's side make it through their tough group			0
@entity23 are in @entity79 along with @entity80 and @entity74 , with only two countries going through to the quarter - finals			0
tickets to watch @entity23 are expensive , and the tournament 's success will be judged on the team 's progress @entity89 's chief executive @entity88 , an @entity80 , reacted to @entity23 's early exit from the @entity91 by tweeting : ' @entity23 fail to exit pool in @entity1 ? ... ? not the words we want to hear during # @entity95			0
' @entity22 said : ' of course you think about it when you at the tough group @entity23 are in and the impact that may or may not have , but from our perspective it does n't make a difference			0
' as a fan i would be very upset but from a delivery perspective we are looking at it being about 20 teams and ensuring they can all compete to the best of their ability			0
@entity22 , chief executive of @entity23 2015 , said those using unofficial sources could be refused entrance ' we want to celebrate the sport and our focus is not about who wins or who is the final			2
when you look at the ticket sales we have only 10 matches left with tickets available and i think that demonstrates the country is getting behind the event , so i am not at all concerned about @entity23 being the sole focus			2
' @entity74 head coach @entity127 said last week he was ' surprised ' by the tweet , adding : ' probably the head of @entity89 does n't need to be doing that , but that 's his own personal views and his own personal decision			0

one *rugby* world *cup* final ticket is advertised on @entity70 for £ 59,000
organisers hope new legislation will act as deterrent to price - *boosted* sales
secondary sales websites will have to publish row and seat numbers
and that could expose sellers who could see their buyers refused entry
