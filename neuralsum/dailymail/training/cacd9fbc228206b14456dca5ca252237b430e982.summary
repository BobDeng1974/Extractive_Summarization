irresponsible : @entity50 ( pictured ) was told the mother had left a mobile phone with the girls but did not have one with her so there was no way that she could be contacted she was instead sentenced to a 12 - month supervision order having pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to neglecting and abandoning her children			1
during the hearing , judge @entity74 said : ' here we have for the second time , little girls left alone to fend for themselves whilst their mother thinks only of herself			0
