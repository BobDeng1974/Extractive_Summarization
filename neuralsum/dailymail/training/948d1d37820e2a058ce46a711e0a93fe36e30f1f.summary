by @entity0 it has been revealed that the @entity2 may have faked the jobs report in the final month of the 2012 presidential campaign			2
unnamed @entity2 employees are said to have inflated their reports for the national employment figures for last september , which would have attributed to why the unemployment rate dropped from 8.1 per cent in august to 7.8 per cent in september			1

working for him : there are new reports that @entity20 employees may have inflated their findings in surveys about the national unemployment rates , which could have helped president @entity24 in 2012 the way that the closely - watched unemployment rate is determined is by having members of the @entity20 interview 60,000 households from across the country about their job status			1
the @entity32 requires that in order to submit a set of results for one of the six regions of the country that are surveyed , they have to have a 90 per cent success rate , meaning that for every 10 numbers dialed , they need to speak to someone about their job status on nine of those calls			0
@entity45 was named as a @entity2 employee who was fired in 2010 for bolstering the numbers by saying that he spoke to more people than he actually did			0
mr @entity45 , who was working specifically in the @entity50 and @entity51 region , had not been hitting the 90 per cent mark but he reportedly had a conversation with a superior who said it was not a problem			0
final days : the most dramatic instance is said to be in september 2012 which came at a critical point in @entity61 's presidential campaign ( seen here with his wife @entity63 before giving his concession speech ) ' it was a phone conversation — i forget the exact words — but it was , " go ahead and fabricate it " to make it what it was , ' mr @entity45 told @entity73 's @entity72			1
mr @entity45 had been fired by the time president @entity24 was facing re-election , but @entity73 columnist says that he spoke to a source who told him the inflation of reports remained a problem long after he left			1
