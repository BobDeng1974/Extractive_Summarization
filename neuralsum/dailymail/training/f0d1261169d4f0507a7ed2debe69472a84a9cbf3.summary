by @entity0 and @entity1 last updated at 9:57 am on 23rd june 2011 for one it was the ecstasy of victory			2
but for two other brits , it was the end of the @entity7 dream			2
our women players experienced mixed fortunes yesterday – but 2011 will still go down as one of their best years in recent history			1
there were high hopes for teenagers @entity15 and @entity17 , but only @entity15 managed to get through to fight another day			2
winning smile : @entity19 beams after seeing off @entity20 in three sets , to the delight of home tennis fans at @entity7 being stretched : @entity19 's first round victory was her maiden @entity26 win it was the 17 - year - old ’s first ever win at a senior @entity26 event , and victory on the green grass of home will have made it that much sweeter			1
@entity35 , meanwhile , had already made it through to the second round – but lost late last night			1
a fourth @entity38 , @entity39 , will play her second round match today			1
three years ago @entity15 became the darling of the @entity42 when she won the @entity44 title and since then expectation has been heaped on her shoulders			1
recently she has struggled with injury and a growth spurt that has taken her to just under 6ft			2
but she battled back from a set down against the world number 76 to win			1
@entity15 is ranked 254th in the world			0
@entity53 @entity20 , 23 , looked like she would win easily in the first set , but @entity15 came through 4 - 6 , 7 - 6 , 6 - 4 double delight : @entity56 salutes the @entity58 crowd after seeing off @entity53 's @entity59 in straight sets , while @entity19 is ecstatic after her battling victory over @entity20 tough task : @entity19 will have her work cut out in the second round against triple @entity26 winner @entity66 here come the girls : @entity19 was joined in round two by @entity70 number one @entity39 and number three @entity35 , who both won on monday meanwhile @entity17 , ranked 93rd in the world , broke down in tears in her post-match press conference after struggling with an elbow injury during her first round match against @entity78 ’s @entity77			1
the 19 - year - old @entity70 number three started to sob as she criticised her performance			0
but she ignored an official ’s offer to halt the interview			0
‘ i just feel like there ’s no excuses now			0
i know how to play tennis , ’ she said through her tears			1
‘ this is what i prepare for			0
this is why i play tennis every day , so i should be ready			1
i feel like i should be winning these matches			0
‘ it ’s so frustrating and i was just disappointed that i lost			0
tender : sir @entity94 rests his hand his wife @entity97 's thigh as they settle down in the @entity99 on @entity100 actress @entity101 was also spotted cheering on fellow @entity103 @entity102 at @entity104 @entity105 - who has been hailed as the @entity106 of tennis - arrives for her match against @entity110 's @entity109 wearing a distinctive jacket royal approval : the @entity113 was another famous tennis fan to take in the @entity102 's dramatic @entity100 win the @entity113 shakes hands with @entity115 as she meets ball boys and girls on her first visit to the @entity7 championships actress @entity120 , left , watches the match with comedian @entity122 and her daughter @entity123 ‘ i ’ve never felt anything like this and i just really wanted to win today			1
and i thought i had the match			0
but it ’s just frustrating because i just really wanted to do well			0
’ the @entity128 teenager took the first set 6 - 2 , but then felt her elbow go and had it strapped up soon after			0
medics wrapped her arm tightly in bandages to curb the pain but it clearly had an effect on her play			1
she went on to lose 2 - 6 , 6 - 4 , 6 - 4			0
there was some consolation though , as the keen @entity141 fan was cheered by tweets from @entity143 saying how impressed he was with her performance			0
he wrote : ‘ unfortunate to see @entity17 lose today , she looks a real prospect			0
’ @entity56 and @entity150 were out on the practice courts in the rain ahead of their second round matches familiar scenes : rain interrupted parts of the day 's play but held off towards evening for @entity15 's stunning win fans wait patiently for the rain to pass on day three of tournament			1
organisers are already struggling with the backlog caused by monday 's rain wiping the tears away , @entity17 said : ‘ that ’s really nice			0
i ’m a @entity141 fan			0
i have to be @entity141 because my dad is , he is from @entity169			0
’ three second round qualifiers – @entity15 , miss @entity39 and miss @entity35 – represents a high level of achievement for @entity70 women ’s tennis			2
not since 2004 , when four @entity70 women made it into the second round , has there been such success for our ladies			2
but miss @entity35 lost her second round match last night in straight sets			2
@entity15 will face @entity184 former champion @entity66 today			1
hours of play were lost to bad weather on the outer courts shelter from the storm : at least those who came unprepared could pay a visit to the @entity7 shop the dreadful weather did n't dampen the spirits of these spectators as they waited for a break in the rain as the @entity70 tennis no.1 he could be excused for regarding the @entity100 as his home			2
but yesterday @entity56 was kicked off @entity7 's premier court after other players had apparently complained of favouritism			1
despite the presence of the @entity113 in the royal box , he was shunted off to the less prestigious @entity206 to make way for matches featuring lesser - seeded players such as @entity102 and @entity210			0
shunned : @entity56 was relegated to @entity58 after other players complained of favouritism no fancy roof yesterday to protect @entity56 's game from the rain up until last year @entity56 , 24 , had played all of his matches , save one , on @entity218			1
however after some of the top seeds suggested this was an unfair advantage , particularly with the new roof ensuring it is the only court where rain does n't interrupt matches , the @entity42 decided to rotate @entity56 's appearances			1
yesterday was only his third time on @entity206 – and both fans and commentators alike ridiculed the decision			2
three - times @entity7 winner @entity232 said : ' if i had made the schedule , i would have put @entity56 on this @entity235			1
@entity210 is a three - time finalist and certainly a hall of fame player , but i 'm not sure his match is going to have people saying , “ i got ta see that ! ” ' @entity56 's girlfriend @entity240 was so unfamiliar with the @entity206 that she got lost and needed a steward to show her to her seat			1
being on @entity58 did little to affect his game as @entity56 comfortably beat @entity59 from @entity53 even the presence of the @entity113 was n't enough for organisers to let @entity56 play in @entity100 spectators were furious at paying upwards of £ 54 a ticket to see the @entity250 on @entity58 @entity56 himself said : ' being on @entity100 is certainly a big help now because you know that , whatever the weather , you 're going to get on , so you can prepare for your match knowing there wo n't be a lot of stopping and starting			1
' @entity100 ticket holders who had paid upwards of £ 54 each expecting to see the @entity250 's match were also furious that they did n't get to see it			0
@entity262 , who was watching with her daughter @entity263 , said : ' @entity56 should definitely be on @entity100			1
' he 's @entity70 and this is a @entity70 tournament			0
' @entity265 and the rest of the royal box were obviously hoping to see a @entity70 player but they got @entity103 instead			0
' tournament director @entity270 defended the decision , saying : ' we think in the interest of fairness , and that covers all the players and all the top seeds , that they ca n't play all their matches on @entity100			2
so we have to move them about a little bit and yesterday was the day we decided to move @entity56			1
' responding to criticism from fans , he said : ' we always make clear to all the ticket holders that there is no guarantee of who they are going to see			0
however the change of court clearly did n't faze @entity56			1
he breezed through his second round match against the unseeded @entity53 @entity59 in straight sets			2
victorious : until last year @entity56 had played all but one of his games on @entity100 the row over monday ’s closure of @entity299 escalated into a full - blown war of words yesterday , after the health and safety watchdog attacked the decision			1
@entity304 , chairman of the @entity305 , issued an open letter mocking @entity7 chiefs ’ move to switch off the giant screen on the sodden slope in case fans slipped and injured themselves			0
she pointed out that ‘ people have been walking up and down wet grassy slopes for years without catastrophic consequences ’			2
the @entity42 appeared to be pressured into a u-turn , with the hill remaining open during yesterday ’s rain – heavier and more persistent than monday ’s			0
yet chief executive @entity270 said he and his officials were ‘ staggered , flabbergasted and amazed ’ that mrs @entity304 should get involved			0
u-turn : these fans make the most of @entity56 's @entity299 in the wet weather before the decision was made to close it over ' elf n safety ' fears			1

win sees three *female* britons in second round for first time in seven years
@entity19 to play former champion @entity66 next on @entity58
@entity56 *cruises* through but male *compatriots* all fall at first *hurdle*
