for the first time , archaeologists have delved into the lives of ancient @entity4 kings - exploring a shrine that pre-dates @entity6 in @entity7 by three or four decades			2
it 's the first evidence of a @entity10 religion in the area at the time of @entity13 - with the inhabitants of the ruins observing a ban on pork and on ' graven images ' of animals or humans			1
prof. @entity21 , the @entity23 professor of archaeology at the @entity24 at the @entity25 excavated at @entity26 , a fortified city in @entity27 adjacent to the @entity28 , and found pottery , stone and metal tools , and many art and cult objects			0
prof. @entity21 , at the @entity25 excavated at @entity26 , a fortified city in @entity27 adjacent to the @entity28 , and found pottery , stone and metal tools , and many art and cult objects because these shrines pre-date the construction of @entity44 ’s temple in @entity7 by 30 to 40 years , they provide the first physical evidence of a @entity10 religion in the time of @entity13			1
the implications are huge - for archaeologists , biblical experts and the religious			2
southwest of @entity7 in the valley of @entity28 , @entity26 was a border city of the @entity27 opposite the @entity53 city of @entity54			0
the city , which was dated by 10 radiometric measurements ( @entity57 ) done at @entity58 on burned olive pits , existed for a short period of time between ca			0
1020 to 980 @entity62 , and was violently destroyed			0
the biblical tradition presents the people of @entity65 as conducting a cult different from all other nations of the ancient @entity68 by being monotheistic and an - iconic ( banning human or animal figures )			2
however , it is not clear when these practices were formulated , if indeed during the time of the monarchy ( 10 - 6th centuries @entity74 ) , or only later , in the @entity76 or @entity77 absence of cultic images of humans or animals in the three shrines provides evidence that the inhabitants of the place practiced a different cult than that of the @entity87 or the @entity53 , observing a ban on graven images			1
because these shrines pre-date the construction of @entity94 s temple in @entity7 by 30 to 40 years , they provide the first physical evidence of a cult in the time of @entity13 , with significant implications for the fields of archaeology , history , biblical and religion studies the absence of cultic images of humans or animals in the three shrines provides evidence that the inhabitants of the place practiced a different cult than that of the @entity87 or the @entity53 , observing a ban on graven images @entity110 , @entity112 fortress at @entity26 overlooking @entity114 valley , where the relics were found			1
@entity116 is in the background the findings at @entity26 also indicate that an elaborate architectural style had developed as early as the time of @entity13			2
such construction is typical of royal activities , thus indicating that state formation , the establishment of an elite , social level and urbanism in the region existed in the days of the early kings of @entity65			0
these finds strengthen the historicity of the biblical tradition and its architectural description of the @entity143 and @entity144 to @entity145 , ‘ this is the first time that archaeologists uncovered a fortified city in @entity27 from the time of @entity13			1
even in @entity7 we do not have a clear fortified city from his period			0
thus , various suggestions that completely deny the biblical tradition regarding @entity13 and argue that he was a mythological figure , or just a leader of a small tribe , are now shown to be wrong			1
’ @entity21 continued , ‘ over the years , thousands of animal bones were found , including sheep , goats and cattle , but no pigs			0
now we uncovered three cultic rooms , with various cultic paraphernalia , but not even one human or animal figurine was found			0
this suggests that the population of @entity26 observed two biblical bans — on pork and on graven images — and thus practiced a different cult than that of the @entity87 or the @entity53			1

ruins had ban on ' graven images ' - so might have been @entity10 religion
inhabitants also observed a ban on pork
evidence of @entity4 king david
@entity13 was ' not a mythological figure '
finds ' strengthen the idea of the @entity4 as history '
