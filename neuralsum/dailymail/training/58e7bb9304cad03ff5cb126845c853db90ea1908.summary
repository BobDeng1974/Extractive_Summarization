by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 has suffered a crushing setback to his summer transfer plans after @entity5 announced he will remain at @entity6 next season			1
@entity8 revealed last week that the @entity10 manager had identified a defensive midfielder as a transfer priority and that @entity6 anchor man @entity5 was his top target			1
but after being quizzed about @entity10 ’s interest , the 25 - year old insisted he would not be heading for the @entity16 and would , instead , be looking to build on his recent return after signing a new contract earlier this season			2
staying put : @entity5 is set to stay at @entity6 despite interest from @entity10 pals : @entity5 will not be joining up with @entity24 team - mate @entity23 at the @entity16 @entity5 ’s form dipped alarmingly in the midst of mounting speculation about a renewed @entity10 bid and a run of poor results that cost @entity31 his job as manager			1
but he capped an impressive display against @entity35 with a goal and was back in peak form in a 2 - 0 win at @entity39 on saturday			0
it has n’t gone unnoticed at @entity10 , but @entity5 was quick to dismiss suggestions he could be on his way after the @entity43 , saying : ‘ i signed my new contract until 2019 , and that should have told everyone how happy i am at @entity6			2
' i feel settled here and see no reason to change anything			0
in fact , if i am to be completely honest , i have n’t had an overly brilliant season and do n’t feel ready yet to take on a pivotal role at a big club somewhere else			0
‘ i need to keep working on my game , and i am going to do that here at @entity6			0
that suits me , and i am happy with that			0
’ as well as a defensive midfielder , @entity10 are also targeting a striker			2
targets : @entity2 's summer plans for rebuilding his midfield may have taken a blow again : @entity10 will finish the season in the @entity66 qualification places			1

@entity5 had *emerged* as @entity2 's top summer transfer target
a defensive midfielder is a priority for @entity10 in the *upcoming* window
@entity5 has announced he will stay at @entity6 next season
