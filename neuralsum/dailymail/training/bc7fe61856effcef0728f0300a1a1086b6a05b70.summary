@entity0 announced yesterday the purchase of @entity2 , a company that builds military robots - though no one knows what the search engine has planned for the cyborgs			1
this was the eighth robotics acquisition in the past sixth months			1
the initiative is headed by @entity11 , the executive responsible for leading development on the @entity14 smartphone , who says the project is a ' moonshot ' and that product development is still several years away			2
up until their purchase by @entity0 , @entity2 was making research robots for the @entity22 ( @entity22 ) , the @entity23 government agency responsibly for developing new military technologies			1
@entity25 ? @entity0 recently purchased robotics company @entity2 , which has developed a robot that can run faster than the fastest human @entity0 would not say how much they paid for the company and will not be releasing financial information			1
they said the company will fulfill all current government contracts , but that @entity0 will not be taking on any more military work			1
@entity2 was founded in @entity33 , @entity34 by @entity36 professor dr @entity35 in 1992			0
since then , they have been developing animal - like robots that can travel faster than the fastest human , and even cover difficult terrains like snowy hills and icy roads			2
slipping and sliding : the @entity2 robot named @entity43 can cover all types of terrain , and is pictured maintaining balance even on a sheet of ice fast one : @entity49 is another of @entity2 ' super fast robots			1
wildcat is n't as fast as @entity52 , but can cover a variety of terrains while most of their work has been done for the @entity23 government , dr @entity55 told the @entity59 that he does not consider his company to be a military contractor and they are simply trying to advance robotics technology			1
second place : the robot named @entity52 can run one mile per hour quicker than the world 's fastest sprinter , gold - medal olympian @entity67 ( pictured ) one of the projects they 're currently working on for @entity22 is the creation of a robot that can operate in a natural disaster , like the nuclear power plant meltown in @entity74 , @entity75			1
' competitions like the @entity78 stretch particpants to solve problems that matter and we hope to learn from the team 's insight around disaster relief , ' mr @entity11 said in a statement released by @entity0			2
and the company has been pretty transparent on what they 're developing			0
they even have their own @entity89 account where they show off what their robots can do			0
a robot named ' @entity52 ' was designed for maximum speed , and was filmed running on a treadmill at speeds up to 29mph which is one mph faster than the world 's fastest man - @entity99 sprinter @entity67			1
that beat the previous record of 13.1 set by a robot in 1999			0
@entity106 's other robots are n't as fast but are designed to cover more treacherous terrain			0
their collection includes both two - and four - legged robots that can climb walls and trees			0
a robot named ' wildcat ' was designed to run fast on all types of terrain and was filmed galloping in a parking lot			0
the robot named @entity43 can climb a steep incline even in the snow , and is able to balance itself on slippery ice			0
dr @entity35 is the so - called ' father of walking robots ' in the @entity23 and started the @entity122 at @entity123 in 1980 to explore walking machines			0
he brought the lab to @entity126 before leaving academia to start engineering work for the miliatary and @entity130			0
' i am very excited by @entity11 and @entity0 's ability to think very , very big , with the resources to make it happen , ' he said .			2

@entity0 recently purchase robotics company @entity2
this was the eighth robotics company that the search engine has bought in the last six months
project leader @entity11 will not say what the company has planned for the cyborgs
@entity2 developed robots for the @entity23 military
one of their robots named @entity52 can travel at speeds up to *28.3mph* , one mile per hour faster than @entity99 sprinter @entity67
