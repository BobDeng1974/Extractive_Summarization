trendy teaching methods such as lavishing praise on pupils can be harmful to learning , says a study published today			1
it warns that many ‘ common practices ’ , such as allowing youngsters to discover key ideas by themselves , are either ‘ ineffective or inefficient ’			1
the report from the @entity11 education charity outlines a range of popular techniques used in classrooms that are ‘ not supported by research evidence ’			1
trendy teaching methods such as lavishing praise on pupils can be harmful to learning , according to a study published today by an education charity ( file pic ) examples include using praise ‘ lavishly ’ , which many teachers believe is an ‘ affirmative and positive ’ way to encourage low achievers			1
it points out that a number of studies suggest that the ‘ wrong kinds of praise ’ can be ‘ very harmful to learning ’			2
research has shown that praise which is meant to boost struggling pupils ‘ actually conveys a message of the teachers ’ low expectations ’ of their ability ’			1
as a result , ‘ it can actually lower rather than enhance self - confidence ’ , the report reveals			0
the report by professor @entity45 and colleagues at @entity47 reviewed more than 200 pieces of research			1
it says another popular technique , ‘ discovery learning ’ , where pupils find key ideas by themselves , is also ineffective			1
the study says : ‘ if teachers want them to learn new ideas , knowledge or methods they need to teach them directly			0
’ former education secretary @entity61 warned such teaching methods were ' sidelining ' members of staff from their ' central role in education ' another trendy teaching method is child - centred learning , where pupils are believed to learn best if teachers tailor lessons to their ‘ preferred learning style ’			1
the report says : ‘ a belief in the importance of learning styles seems persistent , despite the prominence of critiques of this kind of advice			0
’ however , the evidence is clear that ‘ there are no benefits for learning from trying to present information to learners in their preferred learning style ’			0
likewise , it is untrue that pupils remember best if they are always ‘ active ’ in lessons , rather than sitting and listening ‘ passively ’			1
‘ if you want students to remember something you have to get them to think about it , ’ the report says			2
‘ this might be achieved by being “ active ” or “ passive ”			0
’ other examples of ineffective teaching practices are encouraging re-reading and highlighting to memorise key ideas			2
studies have shown that ‘ testing yourself , trying to generate answers , and deliberately creating intervals between study to allow forgetting ’ are better			0
the report also found that grouping pupils by ability makes very little difference to learning , as teachers can go ‘ too fast with the high ability groups and too slow with the low ’			2
it said that the two factors with the strongest evidence of improving students ’ attainment are teachers ’ content knowledge and the quality of instruction			0
professor @entity45 said : ‘ great teaching can not be achieved by following a recipe , but there are some clear pointers in the research to approaches that are most likely to be effective , and to others , sometimes quite popular , that are not			0
‘ teachers need to understand why , when and how a particular approach is likely to enhance students ’ learning			0
’ former education secretary @entity61 warned that trendy teaching methods were ‘ sidelining ’ members of staff from their ‘ central role in education ’			0
last year , @entity138 , emeritus professor of education at the @entity140 , claimed that many teachers have an ‘ actual fear of knowledge ’ and believe it is wrong to correct pupils ’ mistakes .			2

' common practices ' are either ' ineffective or inefficient ' , experts say
report from education charity says using praise ' lavishly ' can be ' harmful '
' @entity155 ' , where pupils find ideas themselves , also *condemned*
also untrue that pupils remember best if they are always ‘ active ’ in lessons
report , by @entity11 education charity , looked at 200 pieces of research
