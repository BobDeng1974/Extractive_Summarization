@entity0 may have scored the goal that put his former club out of the @entity3 , but he was not the only former @entity5 star who was on target on monday night			2
on an evening where @entity9 lacked creativity and firepower , three players they have let go in recent years scored around @entity13 to win their side crucial matches			2
to add to @entity17 striker @entity0 's triumphant @entity5 return , on loan winger @entity19 - deemed surplus to requirements by @entity22 - and @entity24 midfielder @entity23 scored for their clubs			1
@entity0 slots home the winning goal after rounding @entity29 at @entity5 on monday @entity0 celebrated passionately after scoring the goal that knocked @entity9 out of the @entity3 @entity0 was one of three former @entity9 players who netted vital goals on the same evening @entity23 , who was allowed to leave @entity9 by sir @entity33 in 2012 after failing to sign a contract with the club , scored a stunning volley from the edge of the box to give @entity39 a 1 - 0 win over @entity41			1
the 82nd - minute goal put the ' @entity44 points clear at the top of @entity46 , and keeps them on course for a fourth straight title			0
in @entity50 it was @entity19 - still technically a @entity9 player - who popped up for the winning goal for @entity53 in their 3 - 2 win over @entity55			0
@entity23 unleashes a superb 82nd minute volley which won @entity39 the game against @entity41 the @entity24 used to be at @entity9 , but was allowed to leave after playing just three league games @entity23 has become a vital part of a @entity39 side on course to win yet another @entity62 title this season @entity63 has reportedly not spoken to the @entity50 winger since he was allowed to leave @entity5 , but @entity19 showed he still has the quality to make the difference when it matters			1
down to ten men , @entity53 had let a two - goal lead slip before @entity19 arrived to score a diving header and secure all three points against the @entity50 league 's bottom side			0
the win keeps @entity19 's side in the hunt to qualify for next season 's @entity76 , something @entity63 's @entity9 look increasingly unlikely to do			2
but none of those will hurt as much as @entity0 's strike on monday night , which was not only another winner from an @entity83 player , but also against his former club			0
@entity19 celebrates after scoring the winner for 10 - man @entity53 in a 3 - 2 win over @entity88 the @entity50 winger was allowed to leave on loan after @entity22 decided he was not needed unlike the @entity90 or the @entity91 , @entity0 is a product of @entity9 's academy			1
but after @entity63 deemed him not good enough for @entity5 - preferring expensive flop @entity94 to warm the subs bench - the 24 - year - old proved he can still score at the @entity5			0
on monday , @entity9 could have done with the composure , bravery and quality shown by @entity0 , @entity19 and @entity23 - but all three had been allowed to leave			1
all three players were allowed to leave @entity5 , and have done well elsewhere since moving			0

@entity0 scored the winner for @entity17 against @entity9
@entity23 and @entity19 also both netted winners for their clubs on monday
all three players were allowed to leave @entity9 and have done well since
