@entity1 head coach @entity0 has warned potential suitors @entity3 is worth more than £ 15million			1
the red - hot striker is the top scoring @entity6 in the @entity7 with five goals and helped fire @entity9 to @entity11 this month			1
@entity12 had been linked with a £ 15million move but @entity0 dismissed the amount - insisting @entity3 would cost much more in today 's market			1
@entity1 striker @entity3 helped fire @entity9 to @entity11 this month ' it does n't sound a lot			1
i would be absolutely astonished if anyone could sign @entity3 from us for £ 15million , ' he said			1
' you look at some of the fees going around in the transfer market that 's just been , everybody seems to start at £ 7million			2
' @entity26 went for £ 11million championship to @entity27			2
what the right figure is i have absolutely no idea and i would n't make the decision as far as that was concerned			2
' but £ 15million does n't sound like a lot of money for a talented , young , @entity6 player with great potential who is playing really , really well in the @entity7 at the moment and who is scoring goals			1
it would have to be higher than that			2
@entity3 scores penalty for @entity9 during under 21 playoff match against @entity43 ' it was a seller 's market in this particular transfer window			1
we know as we kept going to try to buy people and we realised how difficult that was			0
' @entity0 would not welcome any offers but believes @entity3 can handle any speculation and it will not harm his performances			1
' i have had a few conversations with him where it 's been a case of ' you keep doing what you are doing and everything will happen for you ' , ' he said , ahead of monday 's visit of @entity62			0
' but he is going to have to deal with that speculation			2
i do n't think there are any alarm bells ringing for me at this particular time and if i saw a change in behaviour or anything like that i would probably have a little word with him			0
' @entity3 is the top scoring @entity6 in the @entity7 with five goals this season but @entity0 admitted , should the 21 - year - old continue his fine form , interest and bids are inevitable			1
' that 's something which could happen , there 's no question about that but i do n't want him to play poorly so that they do n't come , ' he said			0
' i am desperate for him to play really well and if that means other clubs come and start knocking on the door then the club will make a decision on whether these clubs are making the right kind of offers or not			0
' if @entity92 can be prised away from @entity12 i think it means every player has got his price			0
' @entity1 @entity0 admits every player has his price and @entity3 could be lured away meanwhile , @entity1 skipper @entity96 is winning his fitness fight to face @entity62			1
the midfielder suffered a groin injury on international duty with @entity101 and missed their wins over the @entity104 and @entity105			0
@entity106 ( groin ) and @entity108 ( personal reasons ) will not feature against @entity111 's side at @entity112 on monday , but @entity113 has been boosted by @entity96 's progress			0

' i 'm expecting everyone who came back to be in contention for the game on monday			0
