by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 16:00 est , 14 september 2013 updated : 16:00 est , 14 september 2013 former @entity3 presenter @entity2 is at loggerheads with his neighbours over plans to ‘ substantially demolish ’ his £ 17 million @entity8 listed house			1
the veteran broadcaster , 66 , wants to rip out much of the building behind the historic facade and replace it with a new six - storey designer home , which would include five bedrooms , a garage , a two - storey basement , a gymnasium , projection room , staff quarters and a wine cellar			1
@entity2 and his wife @entity21 also intend to transform the exterior by adding a series of pergolas to the garden and a set of balconies to the house itself , giving views over their @entity32 square			2
@entity2 intends to develop this @entity8 listed @entity33 to the dismay of his neighbours who say the plans are ' out of character ' for the area but local residents claim the couple ’s plans for the @entity43 villa , which dates back from 1826 , are out of character with the area and would impinge on their privacy			1
@entity2 ’s ambitious plans for the house , which will be considered by @entity50 ’s planning committee on tuesday , could cost more than £ 10 million to implement			1
but local property experts say the alterations could more than double the current value of the house to an asking price of about £ 40 million			2
the former @entity3 presenter and his wife , @entity21 , plan to update the historic property by installing features like a two - storey basement and gym last year it emerged that @entity2 and @entity21 had sold another luxury property for £ 35 million – more than 40 times what they paid for it in 1993			0
the value of that house , which was bought by @entity70 businessman @entity69 , had been significantly raised by extensive renovations			0
but @entity2 ’s plans for the new house , which he does not currently live in , could be rejected by @entity50 councillors			1
the council ’s officials have already recommended that the scheme be turned down			1
their recommendation follows complaints from residents who worry the pergolas are ‘ too brutal ’ and that the basement development would set a damaging precedent for the area			2
three neighbours have also warned that the balconies would give intrusive views of their properties			0
@entity89 , secretary of @entity90 , accepts that the existing building is in need of renovation , but believes that the current design would be overbearing			0
in a letter to the council sent last month , he wrote : ‘ we do not consider that introducing a modern style of design needs to be out of keeping with the architectural style of the houses in the square , but the scale of the extension is very large and we feel will be obtrusive			0
’ local @entity106 council member @entity105 said : ‘ there are concerns about both the design of the proposed building and the implications for privacy			0
’ @entity2 last night insisted he was doing his best to address the concerns and that the plans would transform a building that was currently ‘ unloved and unlived - in ’			2
he said : ‘ it ’s always hard to reconcile different views on architecture , and most planning applications in central @entity32 meet resistance , which is why we ’ve put this out to extensive consultation and made many changes as a result			0
