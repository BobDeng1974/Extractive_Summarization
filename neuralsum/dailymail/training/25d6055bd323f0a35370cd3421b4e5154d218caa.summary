by @entity0 published : 16:40 est , 22 may 2013 updated : 05:54 est , 23 may 2013 you may have been trying to get out of doing the lawn since last weekend , but as a nation we ’ve been attempting to find a way to avoid it for more than 50 years			2
nowhere was that more obvious than at the @entity7 yesterday as the latest gadgets for keeping life easy in the garden were revealed			0
in 1959 , @entity7 featured a ‘ garden of to - morrow ’ showcasing a remote - controlled mower which the exhibitors said would revolutionise the way we cut our lawns			2
the exhibition brochure also predicted that ‘ mist propagation , automatic blinds and thermostatic controls for greenhouse heating and ventilation ’ were ‘ confidently expected within a few years			0
’ but it said that ‘ plastics ’ were ‘ the most exciting development for gardeners ’ , with the exhibitors gushing that there were now ‘ plastic cord and labels that would never rot ’ and ‘ polythene containers that allowed you to see the level of the contents without opening them			0
’ some 54 years later , crowds at this week ’s flower show showed equal enthusiasm when today ’s cutting edge lawnmowers were demonstrated			0
far from the @entity60 model ’s clunky remote control panel and cumbersome box that looked like @entity62 ’s assistant @entity63 , the @entity21 robotic lawn mower drew intrigue from passers by as it meandered around a grassy patch at this year ’s flower show			1
@entity69 “ robo - mower ” handles the cutting of the grass without human intervention , while its owner ‘ relaxes ’ nearby			1
it can handle lawns with an area of up to 1,000 square meters ( 10,764 sq ft ) , although after doing about 200 ( 2,153 ) it will have to take itself back to its charger to top up its lithium - ion battery pack			1
it is able to find that charger on its own , and takes 90 minutes to fully recharge			0
once re-charged it will return to the point where it left off , and continue mowing			0
it takes about 20 minutes to mow each 200 sq m – which is four times quicker than other robotic mower previously made , the company claims			1
part of the reason for its speediness is the fact that it mows in orderly sequential rows , like a farmer swathing their crops			0
blast from the past : the @entity101 controlled lawn mower being demonstrated at the @entity7 in 1959 it is also able to sense obstacles or surfaces it should not mow , such as gravel , and automatically figures out how to adjust its mowing pattern in order to avoid those			1
it is better for the grass than similar robotic lawn mowers and is more energy efficient because it works systematically around the garden rather than mowing randomly in a pingball effect			1
the mower costs £ 1,399 from @entity119 and is @entity120 - manufactured for @entity21 in @entity121 , @entity122 .			2
