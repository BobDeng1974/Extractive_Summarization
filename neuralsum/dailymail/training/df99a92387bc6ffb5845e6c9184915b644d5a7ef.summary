some historians believe that up to 200,000 women - mostly from the @entity18 - were made to work in frontline brothels as ' comfort women '			1
recognition : supporters of comfort women have continued to demand an formal apology from the @entity3 government for their treatment in @entity7 appalled : archive director @entity25 said the documents ' contents left staff chronically depressed shocking : @entity1 has released documents , which it claims prove the @entity30 forced women into @entity7 brothels in @entity3 - controlled @entity1 since the war , @entity3 politicians and authorities have repeatedly refused to be held accountable for the abuse of the women who were forced into prostitution			1
as recently as 2007 , @entity3 prime minister @entity40 caused international outrage when he denied that they were made into the former @entity30 's sex slaves , the @entity39 reported			1
comfort women were forced to work in occupied @entity1 , where brothels were set up in between 20 to 30 counties in the country 's north - east region			1
@entity50 provincial archives research fellow @entity49 told @entity51 that documents show the @entity3 military used the national general mobilisation act to forcibly conscript @entity18 comfort women			1
he added that these @entity18 women sex slaves were dispensed to high - ranking officials			0
@entity3 refuses to directly compensate surviving comfort women , stating all claims were settled by a bilateral treaty that normalised diplomatic ties in 1965 protestors wear the masks of @entity3 political figures including prime minister @entity40 ( second right ) during the rally another released document shows the recorded amount of women sent to have sex with @entity3 soldiers in parts of occupied @entity1 in the 10 day period from february 1 , 1938			1
in @entity75 region there were reportedly 141 women and 2,500 @entity3 soldiers			2
detailing the full extent of the atrocities , @entity1 research centre on comfort women director @entity81 said these figures equated to one woman being tortured 178 times in 10 days			1
' the archives of @entity87 army unveiled this time and other times showed clearly that @entity3 military and government implemented sex slavery in the army			0
the mechanism was influential and forcible			0
it was against the personal wills of these women			0
second , it was widely adopted , ' @entity81 said			0
some historians believe 200,000 women were sexually abused between 1932 and 1945 on the frontline @entity3 refuses to directly compensate surviving comfort women , stating all claims were settled by a bilateral treaty that normalised diplomatic ties in 1965			1
in 1995 , a privately run @entity5 women 's fund was set up , but because it relied on donations , many women refused to accept any compensation not paid by the @entity3 governmernt and this resulted in the fund ceasing in 2007			1
the military police corps was part of @entity3 's @entity87 army , which was the occupying force sustaining the @entity118 regime in @entity118 in the early 1930s			1
newspaper articles , letters from @entity3 soldiers , military files discovered in the 1950s and kept at the @entity50 provincial archives in north - east @entity1 as well as the regime 's national bank documents are included in the archives			1
the archive 's director @entity25 said the contents of the documents were shocking			2
' going through the bloodiest parts of these archives , many of us experts have succumbed to chronic depression , ' he said , according to the official @entity135			0
@entity136 , 81 , has been an archive employee since 1948 and said a @entity138 unit discovered the documents in november 1953 , while soldiers were digging close to remains of the @entity3 bases where they were fixing electric cables and laying pipes			2
among the 89 documents , details of the @entity75 massacre were also revealed emotive disputes linked to @entity3 's 1910 - 45 colonial rule over the @entity18 have left relations between @entity151 and @entity152 at their lowest ebb for years			1
the issue of comfort women , in particular , has contributed to a virtual freeze in diplomatic ties between the neighbours			2
historians say up to 200,000 women , mostly from @entity161 but also from @entity1 , @entity162 , the @entity163 and @entity164 , were forced to work in @entity3 army brothels			1
@entity3 has long maintained that all issues relating to the colonial period were settled under a 1965 bilateral treaty that normalised diplomatic ties with @entity161			0
according to the government official cited by @entity171 , the offer of another apology and further compensation would be formalised only after confirming the issue ' has been completely settled ' to ensure that @entity161 never brings it up again			0
@entity3 previously offered money to former sex slaves through the @entity179 , a private body set up at @entity151 's initiative in 1995 and run until 2007			2
but some survivors refused the cash because it did not come directly from the @entity185 politicians have expressed exasperation at @entity152 's repeated requests for contrition			0
repeated wavering since the apology among senior right - wing politicians has contributed to a feeling in @entity161 that @entity3 is in denial and not sufficiently remorseful			2
there are 55 surviving former comfort women in @entity161			1
he said the documents completely filled a truck , but because they had been buried for so long , many unusable because they rotted into a single mass or were stuck together			0
the archive in @entity201 , the provincial capital , analysed the documents in 1982 after receiving them from a local law enforcement office			0
yet today , most of the documents remain untranslated , due to the poor quality of the material and also a lack of @entity3 - speaking researchers			2
while it was not clear why @entity212 released the 89 documents on friday , @entity1 state media believes it could be a reaction to on - going claims by conservative politicians that the comfort women were not forced by the military or government officials			1
experts have said the archives provide important historical value because they contest the denial of war crimes by the @entity3 right - wing			0
the 25 previously confidential files relating to sex slaves include telephone records , documents mentioning sexual enslavement of women and other reports , according to @entity1 media			2
a telephone record taken from the national bank of @entity118 in 1944 shows the @entity3 imperial army spent 532,000 yen on establishing what they called comfort stations , according to the @entity239			0
other records reveal how the @entity3 army abducted women from the @entity18			0

@entity3 authorities also dispute this figure , while far - right commentators have gone as far to claim @entity1 fabricated the massacre			2
@entity3 caused outrage in @entity161 and @entity1 this year when it announced plans to re-examine a 1993 statement , where the government acknowledged for the first time the military 's role in forcing women into sexual slavery			1
at the time , the government 's chief spokesman @entity261 , apologised for the women 's suffering , but demands that the @entity265 ( houses of representatives and councillors ) vote to approve the statement , were not met			0
public figures close to @entity3 prime minister @entity40 have also increased tensions between the country and @entity161 by claiming @entity3 was unfairly singled out for criticism of its wartime conduct			0
@entity40 has since confirmed he will not change the statement , which has been maintained by the following @entity3 administrations since its issue more than 20 years ago by then chief cabinet secretary @entity261			0
