@entity0 was on the 10.30am @entity2 flight out of @entity3 for @entity4 on tuesday morning			0
it ’s the week of the @entity7 quarter - finals , therefore the @entity9 director of football would have expected to be on the move			1
this week , however , just like last year , @entity0 is on the outside looking in			0
@entity9 succumbed meekly to @entity12 last month leaving him to plan his schedule only as a voyeur			2
the thought of @entity0 and his favourite coach , @entity22 , in the same stadium as @entity18 attempt to turn over a 3 - 1 first leg deficit to @entity20 certainly provides some appropriate imagery			1
@entity22 is the man @entity0 would like to install at @entity9 in the summer of 2016			1
@entity9 are keen for @entity18 manager @entity22 to become their new manager in 2016 @entity22 cut a frustrated figure as he watched his side lose 3 - 1 at @entity20 in the @entity7 last week @entity22 ( right ) speaks with midfielder @entity27 during @entity18 's training session on monday the 44 - year - old will come under more scrutiny if @entity18 fail to overturn their quarter - final deficit on tuesday despite winning the @entity34 last season , @entity9 boss @entity32 has come under - fire this term @entity9 director of football @entity0 ( left ) and @entity22 enjoyed a successful relationship at @entity12 these , however , are peculiar times for both men			1
@entity22 is facing his first @entity7 exit prior to the semi-final stages of his coaching career and at the hands of relatively inconsequential opposition too			1
@entity0 , meanwhile , has a decision to make , along with the members of the @entity9 hierarchy , about their current manager @entity32			1
certainly , @entity22 ’s position is interesting			2
the @entity7 – a competition he won twice in four seasons at @entity12 – is central to his identity			0
he has only ever lost ten matches in six seasons as a coach			0
nevertheless , last season ’s 5 - 0 aggregate dismantling at the hands of @entity59 in the last four raised eyebrows in @entity61			0
@entity18 were the defending champions when he took over , after all			0
now he faces even greater ignominy unless his injury - hit team can produce something special on tuesday night , this in a week that has seen the club ’s distinguished doctor @entity66 walk out in protest at @entity22 ’s methods and attitude			2
such scrutiny , such criticism is relatively new to @entity22 , who is still only 44			0
last week @entity18 chief executive @entity73 refused to criticise @entity22 ’s team			1
previously , however , he had been scathing in his assessment of the @entity77 defender @entity76 , a player who performed horribly in @entity78 last week and who @entity22 recommended for a new contract just last summer			2
none of this is helpful to a coach when he is trying to navigate the closing stages of a season that always asks big questions of teams and squad stretched by injuries and fatigue			0
in some ways , though , it may play in to @entity9 ’s hands			0
@entity22 is facing his first @entity7 exit prior to the semi-final stages of his coaching career last season ’s 5 - 0 aggregate dismantling at the hands of @entity59 is still raw in the minds of @entity18 @entity18 doctor @entity101 ( centre ) quit last week after a reported rift with @entity22 @entity76 , @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106 ( @entity107 ) trudge off the pitch after defeat in @entity20 @entity22 – whose team are expected to clinch another @entity112 title this weekend and are in the final of the @entity114 – has only a year left on his contract at @entity18			1
it is , frankly , difficult to see him extending his stay			0
he wants to manage in the @entity34 and though he has a fondness for @entity119 , the appeal of working with @entity0 and @entity9 chief executive @entity121 after their successful time together at @entity12 is clear and understandable			2
can @entity9 really afford to wait for him , though ? with their own squad in need of radical work after the disappointments of this season ’s dismal @entity34 title defence , can they really ask @entity32 to enter the final year of his own deal at the @entity129 as a sitting duck coach ? history tells us that managers who know they are leaving do not generally perform well in @entity134			1
sir @entity135 attributed @entity137 ’s disappointing 2001 - 02 season to his own publicly declared intention to retire – subsequently reversed – while this year @entity140 ’s form has fallen off a cliff after the club ’s decision to not to renew @entity145 ’s contract this summer became clear			2
if @entity9 have real intentions to make up ground lost to @entity151 ’s @entity150 next season then they will need a playing squad driven and motivated fully			0
it is hard to see that happening if they are still playing for a man who can not influence their careers beyond the month of may 2016			0
@entity22 only has a year left to run on his current contact at the @entity158 after this season the @entity160 boss is on course to win another @entity112 title and @entity18 are in the @entity114 final having enjoyed success in first @entity165 , and now @entity167 , @entity22 's next destination is set to be @entity134 city know all this , of course , but their options are limited			1
@entity173 ’s name has been mentioned as a short - term option			0
the club ’s current academy head wants to manage and would like it to be at @entity9 , where is highly regarded by those who matter			0
why , though , would @entity9 expect their first team players to work for an interim coach any more than they would a man , @entity32 , who has , after all , won a @entity34 and @entity182 during his time in @entity3 ? it is , sadly , a conundrum , without a clear solution			1
a rather old school course of action would be for @entity0 to knock on @entity73 ’s door on tuesday evening and offer @entity18 an awful lot of money to buy out @entity22 from his contract at the end of this season			1
if @entity18 go out of the @entity7 on tuesday , it may not cost @entity9 as much as they think			1
in football , timing is everything			0
maybe it ’s time for @entity9 to be brave			2
@entity9 's academy boss @entity173 ’s name has been mentioned as a short - term option to replace @entity32			1

@entity18 trail @entity20 3 - 1 in their @entity7 quarter - final *tie*
@entity22 's contract as @entity18 manager expires in the summer of 2016
@entity32 's deal at @entity9 finishes at the same time too
