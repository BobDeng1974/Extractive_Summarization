by @entity0 follow @ @ neilashton _ @entity1 is sending an @entity3 delegation to assess the state of the pitch in @entity6 amid concerns about the poor surface quality			1
pictures emerged on wednesday of a poorly prepared surface inside the @entity11 ahead of @entity13 's opening group game there against @entity15 on saturday			1
the grass is n't greener : @entity13 will open their @entity18 campaign against @entity15 at the @entity11 patches : the pitch appeared dry in places and was noticeably bare , just three days ahead of the @entity23 match running out of time ! a lonely groundsman cuts te grass in the empty @entity11 stadium hoof and hope ? the uneven pitch surface is unlikley to promote passing football for @entity13 's opener it 's not the @entity34 ! weathered lines are clearly visible across the pitch in @entity6 even the man in charge of @entity6 's pitch admitted it was in ' bad shape '			1
@entity1 's squad make the four - hour journey by plane deep into the @entity45 on thursday and will not even practise at the @entity47 - appointed training ground			0
instead , the @entity3 revealed that the team will work in the gym on thursday afternoon before training in the stadium on friday evening			0
@entity13 's advance party will check the condition of the pitch - in line with @entity47 regulations - and report back to @entity1 at the team hotel			2
@entity56 , head groundsman for the @entity58 company which is responsible for the turf at @entity6 and six other @entity18 stadiums , said : ' frankly , @entity6 is in bad shape			1
we 've started to implement an emergency plan to try to save the field and improve it as much as possible , but i do n't think it 'll be in good condition by the weekend			0
we put fertilizer on and we 'll increase the fertilizing process with biostimulants and seeds to try to get the most out of the grass			0
' on tack : @entity75 road builders work inside the stadium area of the @entity11 in @entity6 @entity13 vs @entity15 - @entity23 - june 14 @entity77 vs @entity79 - @entity78 - june 18 @entity80 vs @entity82 - @entity81 - june 22 @entity83 vs @entity85 - @entity84 - june 25 @entity13 players have so far insisted they are not concerned about the quality of the pitch , but behind the scenes there are genuine reservations about what they are likely to face			1
@entity1 is also waiting on positive news for @entity94 after he was forced to miss training yesterday with a strained muscle in his right leg			0
the @entity13 forward limped out of training on tuesday and was forced to miss the entire session at their @entity101 military training centre on wednesday			2
instead , he worked with physio @entity102 but will travel with the rest of the squad to @entity6 after a scan revealed there is no serious damage			2
on wednesday , @entity1 juggled his team in training and played @entity109 out on the left during a practice match			0
at this stage , it seems a straight fight between @entity94 and @entity109 for the final spot in @entity13 's starting line up against @entity15			2
that means @entity118 is likely to start in his preferred no 10 role behind @entity120 with @entity121 out on the right in a 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 formation			0
up for the battle : @entity125 and @entity126 will come face - to - face in saturday 's encounter warm weather : @entity130 is sprayed with water as the @entity13 defender bids to stay cool during training on your bike : @entity136 and @entity137 , who is set to miss the @entity15 match , observe training concern : @entity94 is an injury doubt for @entity13 's @entity23 opener against @entity15 on saturday			1
