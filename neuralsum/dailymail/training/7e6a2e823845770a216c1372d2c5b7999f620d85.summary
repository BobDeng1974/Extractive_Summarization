by @entity0 published : 02:48 est , 18 april 2013 updated : 05:21 est , 18 april 2013 artist 's impression : @entity3 had designed column , a spiral of steam that should have risen up the @entity7 was last night blasted for wasting £ 535,000 on a giant steam artwork - which ended up being nothing but hot air			1
artist @entity3 had designed column , a spiral of steam that should have risen more than six miles into the sky from a floating platform on the @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity17			1
now , following huge amounts of @entity20 money being spent on the steam spiral project , the @entity7 has finally admitted defeat after 15 months of repeatedly failing to make it work			1
@entity25 councillor @entity24 insisted yesterday that the project was ‘ a complete and utter waste of public money ’			1
he said : ‘ they should have done their homework before committing £ 500,000 , especially given what we 've got going on today - people starving , we 've got food banks all over the place			2
how many people could you feed with £ 500,000 ? ’ the budget for mr @entity3 's project was originally £ 500,000 , including a £ 40,000 fee for the artist , but it subsequently rose by £ 35,410			1
none of the money will be recouped			2
the project was set to have run throughout last year as part of the @entity46 tie - in with @entity47			2
column was originally due to launch in december 2011 and run for 12 months			2
the steam spiral was intended to have risen from @entity51 dock in @entity52 and been visible for at least 62 miles on a clear day , becoming a ‘ nationally and internationally recognised landmark ’			0
artist : @entity3 is known for using mist , light and projection to create ethereal ' sculptures ' in mid-air but it was repeatedly delayed			1
the @entity61 was worried that it would interfere with aircraft and the @entity63 had concerns that it could cause @entity65			0
vision : mr @entity3 's working maquette of @entity48			1
the @entity7 has finally admitted defeat after repeatedly failing to make the full version work however even after those fears were allayed , the steam - generating mechanism did not work properly and the column still did not appear			1
such vertical steam spirals occur occasionally in nature , when they are known as waterspouts , but nobody has managed to recreate one on this scale by man - made means			0
the @entity7 yesterday rejected accusations that it was a waste of money			1
@entity83 executive director @entity82 said she was ‘ disappointed ’ that the artwork was scrapped but there was always a risk in commissioning ground - breaking artworks			0
she added : ‘ what became clear was that it just could n't be done within the budget or the timescale			0
i think there comes a point where you have to say we really tried , we worked hard to realise it , but it ca n't be done			0
‘ it is a project that was visionary and testing new technical equipment			0
in the end it was n't able to deliver the vision of the artist			0
’ the project was originally announced in 2009 , when @entity7 across the @entity103 commissioned 12 works to coincide with the @entity47			1
the other 11 artists taking the lead commissions - ranging from a set of three crocheted lions in the @entity109 to a new football pitch created in a forest in the @entity112 - were all a success			0
ms @entity82 stressed that most of the money spent on @entity48 had gone into the local economy			1
@entity3 , born in 1946 , studied graphic design in @entity117 , @entity118 , in the late 1960s before moving to @entity119			1
there he began experimenting with light and cinema techniques but withdrew from creating art for 20 years until he restarted his ' solid light ' series - using digital projections rather than 16mm film			0
she added : ‘ the investment has been into the region			0
the final project , in all its magnificence , has n't been realised , but it absolutely is not a waste of money			2
’ @entity103 - born and @entity135 - based mr @entity3 is known for using mist , light and projection to create ethereal ‘ sculptures ’ in mid-air			2
he said : ‘ it is with profound disappointment that we have decided to draw our project to a close			0
‘ my team has worked long and hard but , due to the many regulatory and technical challenges , we have not been able to bring @entity48 to completion			0
