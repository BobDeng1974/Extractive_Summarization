by @entity0 a mother who left her toddler son to die in a @entity3 scalding bath for two hours while she was passed out on a cocktail of drugs has been jailed for three years			1
@entity7 , 38 , had claimed she became dizzy and fainted as she stood up while bathing her two - year - old son , @entity8 at their home in @entity11 , @entity12			1
but a jury ruled that she was guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence after evidence emerged showing she was a persistent drug user and left @entity8 to suffer horrific burns and drown while she was high on a mixture of diazepam , temazepam , heroin , cocaine and cannabis			1
tragic : @entity7 , 38 , ( left ) left her two - year - old son @entity8 ( right ) to drown after taking a cocktail of eight different drugs and passing out while he was in the bath			1
she was found guilty of manslaughter @entity8 was found face - down in the bath water with burns across almost his entire body on january 4 last year			1
@entity32 @entity31 heard how @entity33 had eight different drugs in her system at the time of her son 's death - diazepam , temazepam , heroin , methadone , tramadol , cocaine , cannabis and the painkiller pregabalin , which she had bought from a friend			1
@entity33 claimed she had only left him alone for five minutes , but @entity51 , prosecuting , said experts agreed he must have spent at least two hours in the water			2
the prosecutor alleged that @entity33 put her son in the bath , and ' affected by drugs , fell asleep '			1
@entity32 @entity31 heard the burns were caused after @entity8 had drowned			2
@entity33 had been prescribed methadone to treat her heroin addiction but she had not been able to get her regular dose because it was ' lost in the system ' , the court heard			0
she was given an emergency dose on january 2 , but failed to collect her prescription the following day			0
experienced : @entity67 , the partner of @entity7 ( pictured left and right ) said she ' deliberately took a cocktail of drugs ' , adding that ' as an experienced drug user , she well understood the dangers ' although methadone was in her body the day @entity8 died , she had also taken tramadol , her partner ’s diazepam , and the painkiller pregabalin			1
the court heard pregabalin produces a ' euphoric ' effect , and that @entity33 had previously tried and failed to get her doctor to prescribe it			0
tests also found traces of heroin , cocaine and cannabis in her blood			0
@entity33 , who lived in the property with @entity8 ’s father @entity67 and their children , had wanted the toddler to ' inhale steam ' to treat a chest infection , the court heard			1
jurors were told that mr @entity8 called 999 at 11.48pm on january 4 last year and said his son was dead			0
mr @entity98 said @entity33 ' deliberately took a cocktail of drugs during the day that would inevitably have an effect on her function , and as an experienced drug user , she well understood the dangers '			2
sentencing her on friday , mr @entity108 said : ' @entity8 died as a result of your gross negligece			2
' ' he was in your care , he trusted you , you let him down , you completely let him down			0
' @entity32 @entity31 ( pictured ) heard how @entity33 had eight different drugs in her system at the time of her son 's death - diazepam , temazepam , heroin , methadone , tramadol , cocaine , cannabis and the painkiller pregabalin mr @entity108 said there was no suggestion @entity33 was responsible for @entity8 ’s burns , which he accepted happened after the boy drowned			1
in mitigation , @entity132 , defending , told the court that no punishment meted out could be any worse than the loss of her son			0
mr @entity139 said : ' no punishment the court can impose will be as great as the loss she is already suffering			0
' speaking after the sentencing , detective superintendent @entity144 of @entity145 said : ' this was a very sad case where a small child was ultimately let down by the very person who he should have been able to depend on			0
' ' @entity8 ’s death was needless and preventable ... he was a normal , healthy little boy but tragically , the choices made by @entity7 in respect of her drug taking , resulted in his premature death			2
' @entity156 said it was conducting a @entity157 ' to see if there are any lessons which can be learned to improve the way in which local agencies work together			0
' @entity162 , independent chair of the @entity163 , said a report would be published in september .			0
