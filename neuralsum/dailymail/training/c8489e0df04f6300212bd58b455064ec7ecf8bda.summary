shocked co-workers found mr @entity3 trapped inside the machinery			1
he was discovered standing on a raised platform , with his torso bent inside the heavy - duty equipment			1
the hydraulic arm of the machine had come down on top of him after he had leaned inside to scrub it down			1
the labourer had worked at @entity29 ’ abattoir near @entity30 , @entity31 , for one year before his death on august 18 2011			1
his colleagues told an inquest in @entity35 that the machinery should have been turned off prior to cleaning and all electrical power cut to the machinery by two separate isolation switches at the slaughterhouse			1
but @entity41 , the firm 's loading bay supervisor , told the inquest : ' he was slumped over the cage of the rise and fall platform			2
' i shouted " what ’s up @entity49 ? " i got no reply and that ’s when i went up to see what his problem was			2
' his voice cracking with emotion , mr @entity41 continued : ' i saw @entity57 trapped between the puller and the rise and fall platform			2
' his hands were blue			2
i knew he was dead			2
' i ran to the manager ’s office to alert them and get them to call an ambulance			0
' mr @entity41 told the inquest it was common for the power supply to be turned back on to wash down machinery after a day ’s slaughter - which is against safety guidelines			1
' i know it goes on , ' he said			0
' it gets switched on , on the cleaning side of it afterwards on most days			0
' it ’s known by me , i do n’t know if it ’s known by other employees			0
' killed instantly : the labourer had worked at @entity81 and @entity83 ' abattoir near @entity30 , @entity31 mr @entity41 claimed he did n’t know the machinery was supposed to be turned off while it was being cleaned			1

' @entity57 had thrown it down in a temper or something			0
he just left the building			0
' labourer @entity102 , who trained mr @entity3 to clean the machinery , said it was policy to turn all the machines off while cleaning down the abattoir			1
' i specifically did say no machines should be turned on , there should be no reason to power on any of the machines and he never questioned me about it , ' said mr @entity102 as he gave evidence to the inquest jury			2
however , the coroner heard how some cleaners did routinely power up the equipment to wash it as it was turning because it was easier and quicker			2
@entity122 worker @entity121 said he received training on the job from ' a friend ' to turn the machines back on for cleaning			0
' when i switched it on , i could wash the machinery a lot better , ' he explained			0
' you do n’t need to switch it on but i switched it on because it was more comfortable for me and that was how my friend showed me to do it			0
' the inquest heard that managers at the abattoir had changed safety procedures after the death , including locking access to the isolation switches which cut power to the heavy machinery			1
a pathologist concluded that mr @entity3 , from @entity147 , @entity148 , died from asphyxiation due to chest compression			1
