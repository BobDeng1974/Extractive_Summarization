by @entity0 published : 20:16 est , 17 january 2013 updated : 20:16 est , 17 january 2013 food prices should be raised to stop housewives throwing out so much , a hereditary peer has said			1
the @entity4 , one of only 92 members of the @entity7 who inherited their seats , made the contentious call following revelations that @entity11 waste up to half of their weekly groceries			2
@entity14 - who is a specialist cheese producer and has her own breed of ‘ @entity17 ’ on her extensive @entity19 estate - made the call despite food prices rocketing in recent years and many families being forced to turn to foodbanks			1
half of all food we buy from supermarkets goes in the bin , despite much of it being perfectly edible , according to a report published last week by the @entity30			2
thrown away : @entity31 , pictured in 1999 , says too much food is wasted and higher food prices would deter families from chucking away groceries but experts blamed the waste on the confusion caused by sell - by dates as well as ‘ buy one , get one free ’ offers that encourage overbuying			1
they did not blame it on low prices			0
@entity14 , who has sat as a cross-bench peer since inheriting her father ’s title in 1975 , said higher prices would make people think twice			0
she told the @entity7 yesterday : ‘ food in this country is too cheap			2
it costs the price of its production in most cases			0
if it gave the farmers a bit more profit , householders , housewives perhaps , who prepare food would be more careful about wasting it			0
’ yet food inflation was at 3.8per cent in the three months to december last year			2
economists have warned that prices will rise further in coming months after a drought in @entity64 last year destroyed nearly half of the corn and more than a third of soya bean crops			0
@entity69 and the @entity70 also had very bad crop yields , putting pressure on prices			2
rural affairs minister @entity74 told peers he ‘ would not wish anything in the way of increases in food prices on consumers ’			1
up to half of all food is thrown away , according to research			0
much of it is perfectly edible he said the government was already trying to tackle waste with landfill taxes			0
@entity31 ’s remarks were also panned for being wildly out of touch by @entity92 ’s agriculture spokeswoman , @entity91 , who said : ‘ at a time when family budgets are being squeezed by food inflation and stagnant wages , it is astonishing that the @entity4 wants food prices to rise			1
’ she added : ‘ the @entity100 figures show that we are in a nutritional recession with people on low incomes buying less food and eating less fresh fruit and vegetables than five years ago			1
this year , 250,000 people will turn to food banks to help feed their families			1
perhaps the @entity111 should visit one to get back in touch with reality			0
’ @entity115 lord @entity114 said the report on food waste , by the showed ‘ a shocking example of inefficiency within the capitalist free market we have ’			1
but @entity92 ’s @entity122 of @entity123 called for a change in the ‘ ridiculous use of best before ’ dates instead			1
he also called for an end of the ‘ dominance of almost perfect - looking potatoes and apples and other forms of vegetables and fruit in our shops			0
’ dumped : but a @entity115 spokesman said the poor were already suffering from high food prices lord @entity74 said the government had already published guidance for the industry on best by or expiry dates : ‘ use by or sell by labels should only be used when the safety of food can not be guaranteed after that date			1
most other food should have a best before date only to indicate when the food is no longer at its best but still safe to eat			0
’ @entity31 can trace her title back to the 1st @entity4 in 115			1
it is one of the oldest earldoms in @entity154			0
she has been married three times and has a daughter , interior designer @entity156 , who goes by the title of the mistress of @entity4 a @entity115 spokesman said : ‘ @entity111 may be surprised to hear that the price of food has been rising pretty steadily for a while now			1
' for most people that ’s not something to celebrate			0
in tough times we should be making life easier for people who are feeling the squeeze , not hiking up food prices			2

@entity31 says a spike in prices would deter the waste of food
her comments come amid *spiralling* prices and families turning to food banks
but @entity115 mp says rises would increase pressure on the poor
a @entity186 mp was *criticised* after referring to catering staff in the @entity188 as ‘ **servants** ’ . @entity190 , mp for @entity191 in @entity192 , was calling for lower prices in the dining rooms , arguing few *mps* were using them . of one *lunch* , he said there were ‘ three **servants** for each person sitting down ’ . @entity92 mp @entity201 said the remark shows ‘ how out of touch ’ he is .
