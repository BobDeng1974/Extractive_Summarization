forget @entity0 and his @entity1			0
and star wars jedi knight @entity3 can take a galactic hike too			0
make way instead for the first real interplanetary spaceman superhero who arguably inspired them all - @entity10 ’s home - grown , lantern - jawed pilot of the future @entity12			1
for today the firm most famous for its car - repair manuals is publishing the nuts - and - bolts inside track into the technology that propelled him through the solar system to worlds far beyond our own			1
pilot of the future : @entity24 has published a manual revealing the technology that propelled @entity12 to worlds far beyond our own , inspiring legions of fans along the way @entity30 's ' @entity22 of the @entity31 ' is an engrossing labour of love from a team clearly devoted to the legacy of a hero who inspired a generation – in the hope that he may do so anew			1
it includes work from some of the original artists , as well as updated cutaways of space - craft , kit and weaponry that remain true to the original spirit			2
for a generation of post-war children - largely though not exclusively schoolboys - @entity12 ’s interplanetary adventures were a vibrant and exotic escape from the grey austerity and rationing that persisted long after global hostilities ended			1
from the moment the first @entity12 strip blasted off in full colour on the front of the revolutionary new @entity60 comic on friday april 14 , 1950 – priced at ‘ 3d ’ , or one and a half pence in today ’s currency - the future never looked brighter			1
it caused a sensation and sold nearly a million			0
the @entity66 : the new manual from @entity24 gives an insight into the technology that powered @entity12 's personal spacecraft , the @entity66 formidable flagship : the manual also focuses on the spacecraft used by rebel leader @entity74 in the legendary @entity60 comic @entity60 comic was the brainchild of former @entity79 chaplain and parish vicar , the rev. @entity81 , who wanted to create a morally - uplifting but no less interesting comic for children which their parents would n’t frown on and ban			1
but it was artist @entity88 who created @entity12 and assembled around him a team working at fever pitch in @entity91 , @entity92 , to script his stories , design his space - craft and gadgets and bring the character and his adventures to life			1
@entity88 used family , friends and colleagues to pose up in costumes for photographs which formed the basis of the finished drawn strips			0
legendary : @entity60 comic was a must - read for a generation of post-war children in @entity10 but it was n’t pure fantasy , with as much care taken with the science - as far as was known or hinted at at the time - as with the fiction			1
with hindsight there are some howlers , but most are forgivable and pale in significance to the majesty of the illustrations			0
@entity122 , who would become the author of ‘ @entity125 ’ is said to have been a scientific advisor			0
originally conceived as a space chaplain complete with dog collar , @entity12 emerged finally in print as chief pilot for the @entity130 on an a somewhat idealised planet earth featuring a @entity133 - inspired world government , glass domed cities , and beautiful garden landscape			1
but there were also problems			0
@entity139 ’s first mission was to @entity140 to find food for a starving earth with a booming population explosion			0
@entity12 's exploits were serialised on @entity145 , which aired @entity146 of @entity12 , @entity147 , five times a week for five years from july 1951			1
the back story is no less fascinating			0
in this alternative modern history of the known universe , it was @entity10 which won the space race , building on @entity155 ’s wartime v2 rocket programme to pip the @entity156 to land the first @entity157 and plant the @entity158 on its lunar surface			0
later the @entity10 was part of a joint mission to @entity162 with the @entity156 , using three spacecraft called @entity164 , @entity165 and @entity166 after the three allied leaders during the @entity168			2
as the uniforms suggest , the @entity130 is a thinly disguised but updated version of the @entity79 , with green rather than blue colouring			0
our hero , @entity173 - born and @entity175 - educated colonel @entity174 , with his distinctive wiggly eyebrow , embodies the true @entity180 spirit of heroism , fair play , and an inner moral strength – always willing to give even his worst enemies a second @entity186 manual includes profiles of his closest friends and colleagues – alien as well as human			1
@entity192 among them are - for the time a gender stereotype - defying breakthrough – a smart , intelligent , brave and resourceful scientific space - woman and nutritionist , professor @entity198 , whose quick - thinking and fluency in alien languages ‘ saves lives '			2
and not forgetting his loyal side - kick @entity203 , a down - to - earth father of four from @entity204 in @entity205 , who steadfastly refuses promotion to stay at his friend ’s side in space			2
@entity12 manual author @entity210 , 66 , admits to having been a fan since boyhood			1
in the small - print of the acknowledgments he gives a salute to @entity216 , ‘ my long suffering wife who became a @entity12 widow for most of the time i was scribbling away '			1
he says : ’ @entity60 took the world of children ’s publishing by storm			0
but the feature that really caught everyone ’s attention , and was to inspire a whole generation of future artists , writers and even scientists , was the @entity22 of the future science - fiction strip			2
the @entity233 : @entity12 fans can immerse themselves in the space pilot 's world once again thanks to the new manual @entity238 : @entity12 first blasted off on the front cover of the new @entity60 comic in april 1950 ‘ it was superbly drawn and scripted and based on science facts of the time , with imaginative innovations thrown in for good measure			1
@entity88 and his team realistically portrayed future equipment and inventions , kindling the imagination of its readers and encouraging a widespread hankering for space travel and interplanetary adventure ’ mr @entity210 went on : ’ at the time post-war @entity10 was full of optimism for a better and brighter future			0
' @entity258 was being prepared , the aviation industry was about to steal a world lead with its @entity262 jet aircraft , and the country was entering upon a boom age which would prompt prime minister @entity265 to famously state ‘ our people have never had it so good '			0
‘ so to many of us space travel felt just around the corner and @entity273 ’s exciting ideas did n’t seem far - fetched at all ’			0
labour of love : the 66 - year - old author of the manual , @entity278 , has been a fan of @entity12 , his loyal pal @entity203 and arch enemy @entity12 since he was a young boy the @entity280 : the manual features pictures of the spacecraft used by @entity12 and his loyal sidekick , @entity203 , as they journeyed through galaxies @entity286 : the superbly drawn comic was based on scientific facts as they were at the time the manual looks at the characters and technology			1
it includes cutaways and details of @entity12 ’s own personal two - seater space - craft , the @entity66 , which was ‘ designed and built in 1997 ’ using alien technology as a special thank you gift			1
it has four different propulsion systems including jet - power to fly , magnetic motors to hover , rocket boosters and revolutionary ‘ impulse drive ’ , similar to what would emerge later in @entity307 as ‘ warp drive			0
’ indeed many technologies which appeared in @entity307 in the mid 1960s had their first outing in @entity12 more than a decade earlier			2
for example , ‘ @entity315 ’ became a catch - phrase in the transporter room of the @entity1			0
@entity12 fans : the new manual from @entity24 , seen above left and right , looks at all the characters and technology that captivated @entity12 fans in post-war @entity10 but the teleportation technology was seen as early as 1950 in @entity12 where it was called a ‘ telesender ’ - technology which scrambled and unscrambled atoms to send people vast distances			1
space hero : @entity12 can count @entity330 's @entity329 and @entity331 , as well as musical maestro sir @entity332 among his fans @entity88 , who died in 1985 aged 66 , commented in later life that @entity307 had ‘ really cleaned out ’ @entity12 ’s technology cupboard of ideas			1
@entity12 ’s arch enemy is the @entity12 , the green - skinned , dome - headed but small - bodied leader of the war - like @entity340 who inhabit @entity140			1
the manual notes : ’ a @entity12 takes 50 years to mature and lives for 300 years			1
' he moves around by means of a personal flying chair that has been armoured against all known hand weapons			0
it goes on : ‘ he is ruthless in his dealings with those who fail him , destroying any who do n’t deliver and has proved very elusive when things go against him			0
a number of times he has been presumed dead , only to resurface again			0
’ @entity12 inspired a legion of avid fans including @entity330 ’s @entity329 and @entity331 , who said : ’ the combination of fantasy and humour , for me , was irresistible			2
’ and musical maestro and song lyricist sir @entity332 , who had copies of the @entity60 shipped over to him while a child living in @entity366 in the 1950s , said : ‘ @entity12 remains an human and likeable character , an emblem of the optimism , straight - forward and culturally confident @entity10 of the 1950s which lives on in @entity12 ’s future , but sadly never made it in ours			2
’ as author @entity210 concludes : ’ @entity12 ’s story has now become the future of an exciting parallel universe rather than our own			2
' it nevertheless remains a fascinating place to be explored			0
’ @entity12 's original home the @entity60 was published from 1950 to 1969 , before being relaunched in a new format from 1982 to 1994			1
the space hero has also appeared in @entity385 and the @entity386 , and was at the centre of a seven - issue mini-series published by @entity389 in 2008			2
the strip has also appeared in @entity392 magazine , which was launched in 2003 and continues today .			0
