by @entity0 published : 18:55 est , 17 april 2012 updated : 18:56 est , 17 april 2012 ministers are ready to spend hundreds of millions of pounds on new spy planes – just months after controversially chopping up a £ 4.1billion fleet of nine unused @entity4 to save money			1
a senior @entity7 officer revealed the @entity8 wants the new planes to plug a ‘ capability gap ’ left by the loss of the @entity4			1
@entity12 axed the ‘ spy - in - the - sky ’ @entity14 aerial surveillance planes in october 2010 , prompting criticism from top military figures and mps who warned it would weaken @entity22 ’s defences			0
costly : one of the @entity14 surveillance planes , which never entered service but even though the then defence secretary @entity27 admitted at the time the move was a ‘ risk ’ , ministers pressed on , claiming it would save the @entity8 £ 2billion over the next ten years			1
@entity31 mounted when photographs emerged last year of wrecking crews chopping the wings off the @entity4 , which never even became operational			1
now ministers are facing fresh humiliation after it emerged the cash - strapped @entity8 is likely to buy ‘ off - the - shelf ’ @entity38 or @entity40 aircraft , both made by @entity43 aerospace giant @entity42			2
air vice-marshal @entity44 , director of the @entity8 ’s joint and air capability transformation , said : ‘ the underlying view of the @entity8 is that an aircraft is likely over the medium term to be the solution that actually fills the gap that was created when we took the @entity14 out of service			1
’ the then defence secretary @entity27 ( pictured ) admitted at the time the move was a ' risk ' the @entity7 officer was giving evidence to the @entity57 ’ defence select committee , which has launched an inquiry into the @entity22 ’s maritime surveillance capability			0
he insisted the decision to demolish the @entity4 had been a ‘ tolerable risk , not a gamble ’			2
but @entity65 defence spokesman @entity64 said : ‘ the government treated probably the most expensive , technically capable aircraft in our history like a second - hand car			0
' they just scrapped it and chopped it into pieces			0
’ an @entity8 spokesman said : ‘ the decision not to bring the @entity14 into service was difficult but our ability to operate maritime patrol aircraft is being maintained			0
‘ only one @entity14 had been delivered to the @entity7 and it had not passed airworthiness tests , the project was hundreds of millions over budget , years late and needed considerable extra funding to rectify long - running technical problems			0

@entity8 wants new planes to plug a ' *culpability* gap ' left by loss of @entity4
