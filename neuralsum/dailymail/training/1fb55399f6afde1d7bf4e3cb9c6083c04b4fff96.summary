by @entity0 imagine getting directions that did n’t just stop at the street location , but showed you exactly where to go inside a building			1
that ’s the thinking behind @entity8 ’s @entity7 , a 3d - mapping service that was announced for phones back in february			1
and now the company has revealed a $ 1,000 ( £ 600 ) tablet prototype that uses the same technology			1
the technology uses 3d scanning sensors , similar to @entity21 's @entity20 , to create whole maps of interior locations @entity7 , headed by @entity25 ’s @entity7 division , has been developed in secret behind the scenes			1
the current prototype is a 5 - inch phone containing customised hardware and software designed to track the full @entity33 motion of the device , while simultaneously creating a map of the environment			1
these sensors allow the phone to make over a quarter million 3d measurements every second , updating it ’s position and orientation in real - time			1
it then combines that data into a single 3d model of the space around the user			0
the technology could be used to capture the dimensions of a person 's home simply by walking around the table			0
directions to a new location could continue beyond a street address into a building that had been mapped by someone else			2
@entity7 could also be used by the visually - impaired to navigated unassisted in unfamiliar indoor places			2
or , when shopping , the tablet could be used to find the exact shelf a project is located on			0
@entity8 also highlights some of the gaming aspects , such as playing hide - and - seek with a virtual character			2
its goal is to use 3d scanning technology , akin to that in @entity21 ’s @entity20 sensor , to create 3d maps of an environment			2
this means that a person ’s phone or tablet , for instance , could produce highly detailed interior maps of buildings , rooms and houses			0
the technology has a number of proposed uses			0
for example , it could be used to measure the dimensions of a home for furniture shopping , or it could allow for interactive games of hide - and - seek			0
this latest 7 - inch tablet , employing the same scanning technology used in the @entity7 phones , will run @entity92 4.4 @entity91			1
the device maps the world in @entity33 through the use of two cameras , one on the front that can see 120 degrees , and a @entity99 camera on the rear			2
a motion tracking camera on the back also helps the mapping process , in addition to an integrated depth sensor			0
aside from the innovative 3d sensors in the device , the tablet will also have a 1080p display			2
inside it is powered by @entity114 ’s quad - core @entity112 chip , and it has @entity116 of @entity117 and @entity118 of internal storage			0
development kits of the device are available to pre-order through @entity8 for $ 1,024 ( £ 610 ) , with the @entity122 reporting there will be about 4,000 prototype tablets available this month			1
the process wlll be similar to how @entity126 was rolled out to a select few ‘ beta testers ’ last year			0
@entity7 can be used by a handset to automatically build a 3d map of anywhere the user is , allowing for far better indoor navigation			1
this could , for example , allow someone to get directions to an exact desk within a building or find the right shelf a product is located on in a shop ‘ the goal of @entity7 is to give mobile devices a human - scale understanding of space and motion , ’ said @entity141 from the @entity142			1
‘ our team has been working with universities , research labs , and industrial partners spanning nine countries around the world to build on the last decade of research in robotics and computer vision , concentrating that technology into a unique mobile device			0
‘ we are putting early prototypes into the hands of developers that can imagine the possibilities and help bring those ideas into reality			0
’ @entity7 was first announced for phones back in feburary , but is now being rolled out to about 4,000 prototype tablets for early adopters this month			1
the process for getting one of the development kit laptops is likely to be similar to how @entity126 was rolled out last year			0

@entity173 - based @entity8 has revealed the next step in its @entity7
the *amibitious* @entity33 mapping technology is being brought to tablets
4,000 prototype tablets with @entity7 will be available this month
the technology uses cameras and sensors to ' map ' environments in 3d
this could be used to provide directions to a specific place in a building
