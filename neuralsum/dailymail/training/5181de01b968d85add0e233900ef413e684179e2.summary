but @entity6 has added another first to his list of achievements - beating a horse in a 10 - mile race			1
the 27 - year - old won the unusual contest , taking on @entity13 , a five - year - old 14.2 hands high @entity14			1
the pair raced through the @entity18 countryside , taking on moorland and bridleways near @entity21			0
challenge : runner @entity6 , who holds the record for the youngest and fastest person to complete 10 marathons in 10 days , raced a horse tango , ridden by his owner @entity27 , over 10 miles , beating his equine challenger by 10 minutes owner @entity27 rode @entity29 , who she rescued along with another horse four years ago , in the race against mr @entity6 , whose running name is tango			1
and despite @entity13 's four legs , mr @entity6 just pipped his equine challenger to the post , winning by 10 minutes			1
he said : ' i think i had an advantage on the hills - i ’m a very good down hill runner but the horse had to walk down the hills			2
' it was good fun			0
i know @entity27 enjoyed it too			2
' ahead of the race dr @entity46 , an expert in equine exercise physiology , said there were many scientific reasons why the outcome would not be as straightforward as people might think			0

record breaker : the 27 - year - old took on the challenge through 10 miles of moorland and bridleways in @entity18 ' of course , not all horses are as good as one another			1
' at 27 , @entity6 is at his peak fitness , while the horse is still quite young			1
endurance horses usually peak at between eight and ten years old			0
' tango has a better capacity to use oxygen , but with heat production is at a disadvantage , because it is bigger and produces more heat			0
' as for @entity6 , he can manipulate his exercise programme and diet to maximise his energy stores before the race			2
' on the course , @entity6 can maintain a consistent speed , but with the changes in ground condition , the horse will use up energy slowing down for turns and then speeding up again			1
' it ’s not straightforward , but if i had a bet i would probably put money on the horse			2
' the event was to raise money for the @entity96 , a charity that works to improve life chances of children and young people			0
