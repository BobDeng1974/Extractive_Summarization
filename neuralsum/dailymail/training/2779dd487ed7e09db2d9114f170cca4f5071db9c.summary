by @entity1 medical correspondent published : 19:49 est , 19 september 2013 updated : 06:02 est , 20 september 2013 taking paracetamol before a workout can stop you overheating , a study indicates			1
researchers found the drug helps cyclists exercise for longer in hot conditions by reducing the impact of heat exertion			1
it was already known that paracetamol swallowed before exercise can lift performance through a reduction in perceived pain			0
work out pills : @entity19 helped the test subjects perform better the latest study shows the positive effect in hot conditions			2
researchers at the @entity24 said the drug appears to reduce the body ’s temperature during exercise , which subsequently improves tolerance to stifling heat			1
the study involved 11 young recreational exercisers , all male , who were given three exercise challenges			1
they consumed single doses of paracetamol , or a placebo , before cycling at a fixed intensity for as long as they could in temperatures of @entity41 and @entity42			0
during the exercise , measures of core and skin temperature were recorded , alongside the participants ’ perception of the heat			1
the results showed the drug allowed them to cycle significantly longer at @entity54 – by an average of four minutes			0
men had a significantly lower core , skin and body temperature and found the exercise produced less heat strain			1
tested : the study was carried out on 11 cyclists , who were given three challenges to complete dr @entity65 , who led the study at the @entity24 ’s @entity67 , said the study raised questions that needed to be settled by sports bodies , including ‘ rescue remedies ’ for people undertaking exercise in hot climates			1
he said ‘ firstly , consideration by the @entity76 ( @entity76 ) and local anti-doping authorities should be made about the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( nsaids ) in sport - on both health and performance grounds			0
‘ secondly , the utility of paracetamol as a first - response drug to exertional heat illness should be investigated			0
’ the same research team have previously shown that paracetamol can improve endurance performance through a reduction in exercise - induced pain			0
dr @entity65 said ‘ whilst we have found that paracetamol improves the time someone can exercise in the heat , and that this occurs alongside a reduced body temperature , we did not measure the specific mechanisms by which this may have occurred			2
‘ it is important now to try and isolate how paracetamol reduced participants ’ body temperature during exercise			2
’ in a 2008 study , researchers at the @entity106 gave paracetamol to 10 cyclists before they completed a simulated 10 - mile time trial			2
on average , they completed this time trial 30 seconds faster after taking the drug than when they performed the same test after taking a placebo			1
the cyclists ’ ratings of perceived exertion were the same on both occasions , which led to the conclusion that paracetamol was improving performance capacity by reducing pain			0
the study is reported in the journal @entity126 .			0

@entity24 study looked at effect on cyclists during a workout
study found that the drug lowered core and skin temperature
participants completed exercise challenges 30 seconds faster as a result
