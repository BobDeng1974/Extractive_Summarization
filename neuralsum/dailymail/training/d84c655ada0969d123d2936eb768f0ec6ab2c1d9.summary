perhaps it is no coincidence that @entity5 's - @entity4 's first modern department store and at one point the world 's largest - was also the first known retailer in @entity4 history to employ a female executive			1
@entity9 , then 22 , joined @entity5 's in 1861 as a clerk , when it still was a struggling @entity12 store selling ribbons and lace , but quickly impressed its founder @entity14 with her innovative approach to sales			1
four years later , the @entity18 - born employee was promoted to ' superintendent ' , an executive - level position , and under her stewardship , @entity5 's tripled in size			1
it went from scraping in just $ 11.06 in sales on its first day , to $ 1million in annual sales in 1869 , and was by then a fully - fledged department store			2
she was well - known for her legendary window displays and her pioneering marketing ideas			0
one of ms @entity46 's most successful moves was to persuade mr @entity14 to install a soda fountain for thirsty customers , buried behind rows and rows of distracting merchandise			0
similar tactics are employed today by every department store in the world			2
another stunt involved dressing up two cats in doll 's clothing and plonking them in baby cribs as part of a window display , which predictably pulled in a huge crowd			0
ms @entity9 's motto was famously : ' be everywhere , do everything , and never fail to astonish the customer			1
' the story of her record - breaking success began in her home town of @entity69 , @entity18 , after she quit her job as a schoolteacher to pursue a life in @entity73 aged 22			0
ms @entity9 , who lost her eye in a childhood accident and so had one glass replacement , was a distant cousin of mr @entity5 , which is how she got her entry - level clerk position			1
she was said to be excellent with numbers , ' pretty ' and extremely hard - working , often staying up into the night to strategize with mr @entity14			0
before long , she was promoted to bookkeeper			0
according to writer and historian @entity83 , an editor at @entity84 , ms @entity9 bombarded her boss and cousin relentlessly with new ideas to grow the business , a tactic she liked to call ' putting a bug in his ear			2
' @entity93 : @entity14 ( pictured ) , who founded @entity5 's in 1858 , was responsible for hiring ms @entity9 , the first female executive of a @entity4 retailer , and credited her with being a ' large ' part of his store 's success historian @entity98 wrote a book about the store 's background , titled history of @entity5 's of @entity12 , 1858 - 1919 , and in it claims that mr @entity14 attributed ' a large part ' of his business ' success to ms @entity9			1
' while it was not at all unusual at this time to employ women in retail stores , to give one of them an executive position of such importance seems to have marked a radical departure from normal practice , ' mr @entity98 wrote			0
in 1869 , when she 30 , ms @entity9 married @entity115 , a friend of mr @entity14 's son , who then became a buyer for the store and later a partner			1
in an undated letter to his sister , mr @entity115 wrote of his wife : ' she is the superintendent , having full charge of the entire business			0
' as we sell a million dollars - worth of goods a year and have nearly two hundred employees , her position is a very responsible one			0
' in an all - too - familiar twist at the time , ms @entity9 was asked to give up her salary after her husband was made a partner			1
as it was : @entity5 's flagship store in @entity137 , pictured in 1931 , when it became the world â€™s largest store with more than one million square feet of retail space today : the current ceo of @entity5 ( pictured ) , which last year pulled in $ 27.2billion in revenue , is @entity143			2
of its 11 current executive leaders , three are women the couple went on to have six children , and although ms @entity9 gave up her full - time position at @entity5 , she often returned to assist with busy periods			1
mr @entity14 died of kidney disease in 1877 at the age of 54 , mr @entity115 died of tuberculosis a year later , and ms @entity9 died of heart failure in 1880 , at the age of 38			2
@entity5 's now operates 850 department stores in the @entity4 , @entity157 and @entity158 , and pulled in $ 27.7billion in revenue last year			1
its current ceo is 62 - year - old @entity143			0
of its 11 current executive leaders , three are women			0
as mr @entity83 points out , it has been 134 years since ms @entity9 's death , and female executives in the retail world are still woefully scant			1
he writes : ' with women still controlling the purse strings when it comes to most household purchasing decisions , and the retail industry still struggling post-recession , most of these companies could benefit from smart women like @entity9 putting a bug in their ears			0

@entity9 , then 22 , quit her job as a schoolteacher to join @entity5 's as a clerk in 1861 when it was still a small struggling fabric store
her *aptitude* for numbers and innovative sales tactics earned her a promotion to become @entity4 's first female executive
after four years under ms @entity9 's stewardship , @entity5 's tripled in size and became the *country* 's first modern department store
she was later asked to *surrender* her salary after her husband was made a partner , and the couple went on to have six children
