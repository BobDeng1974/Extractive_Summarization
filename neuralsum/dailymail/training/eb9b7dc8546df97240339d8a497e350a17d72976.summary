@entity27 , wildlife manager for the @entity28 , said : ' the play equipment is well used and there 's always the concern that a child or adult could turn their feet badly on the uneven ground			2
' it 's an area the boar have expanded into to feed			2
if they find an area which has a good source of food they will keep coming back			2
' in the forest we 've seen this repeatedly on grass verges outside homes , and it upsets a lot of people			0
' we 've always had issues like this with the boar but more problems are being caused as their numbers go up			0
' a @entity25 town council spokesman said it can not control the wild boar , but they can do everything possible to limit the damage they cause			1
deputy mayor of @entity25 @entity65 said the town council is looking at installing fencing with mesh to prevent the boar from breaking through			2
the recent attacks on the land ( pictured ) have been blamed on the soaring boar population in the @entity11 , and a forestry chief says their numbers will continue to grow because there has been a lack of culling he said : ' the play area looks like a battleground and the grass has been eaten more consistently in the last two months			1
' lumps of grass and earth have appeared and it 's not very good for walking or running in			0
it 's no longer fit for purpose			0
' we 're going to attempt to fence the area off from the forest , but it 's not registered land so we ca n't surround it completely			0

the town council has said a fence to ward the animals away will cost thousands of pounds and will damage budgets for the community the wild boar population in @entity11 is constantly growing and there is no sign their numbers will fall			1
the animals are prolific breeders , and young females have litter sizes of eight to ten			0
those animals will then go on to have their own offspring the following year			0
the wild boar do not have any predators , which is another reason their numbers are a problem			1
mr @entity27 , senior wildlife manager for the commission , said : ' we have not been culling enough and the population continues to increase year on year			0
' it is quite simple to see how the population can quickly escalate and it is fairly common in @entity123			0

beasts are *roaming* onto area beside where kids climb and use swings
the animals in @entity11 , @entity12 , attracted to food source
forestry chiefs are worried about *locals* getting hurt on uneven ground
council leaders ' can not control wild boar ' but will try to limit damage
may install anti-boar fencing to ward off animals soaring in numbers
