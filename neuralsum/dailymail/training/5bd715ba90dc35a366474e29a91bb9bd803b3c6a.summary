by @entity0 these days the perfect pint comes in many forms - beers are flavoured with citrus fruits , jalapeno and even bacon			0
but now there is a brew made from fossils and it is said to taste ' sweet and untamed '			2
the founder of a palaeontology and geology organisation set out to find an untapped strain of yeast to make his strange brew in a bid to sneak science into drinks			2
an ancient brew : @entity20 is made from bacteria discovered on a whale fossil ( pictured )			1
two scientists looking for an ancient yeast sample from which to make their brew , discovered a new subspecies and plan on using different fossils to make more palaeontology - themed beers the creation is called @entity20 and it is said to taste sweet and fairly much like @entity32 beer			1
@entity33 , of @entity34 , worked with a brewing scientist called @entity36 from the @entity37 to create his unusual tipple , which includes yeast found on a 35 - million - year - old whale fossil			1
the pair had worked before at a biomedical research centre in @entity43 , @entity44			0
@entity47 , which is responsible for converting sugar to alcohol , is found in many places and using swabs and petri dishes , the duo discovered that it is found on the surface of fossils , @entity45 reported			0
yummy : the scientific beer - brewing duo had ambitiously hoped that the wild yeast was a completely new strain , but instead of a new species , they captured a previously - unknown subspecies of @entity62 ( pictured ) , which is well known to breweries and wineries mr @entity36 originally planned on extracting ancient yeast samples from inside pieces of amber , which has already been attempted by another brewery in @entity69			1
but after discarding the @entity72 - inspired idea , the pair visited @entity73 in @entity74 , @entity75 , to swab and collect dirt from fossils , according to @entity78			1
they collected around 20 samples in total but were initially disappointed because ‘ the samples were almost 100 per cent bacteria , ’ but then they noticed that one containing cells from the extinct whale bones , was fermenting			0

but they discarded the @entity72 - inspired idea ( pictured ) in favour of swabbing fossils the new variant is called @entity98 after the protocetid whale fossil from which they took the swabs			1
the duo fed the yeast with wort from the brewery ’s ‘ @entity107 ’ recipe and let the mixture ferment for a few weeks			0
mr @entity36 told @entity109 : ' we did two test batches with the yeast i isolated from the fossil bone from the @entity115 and we are going to make a big batch on the april 17			1
the brewery in @entity43 , will be serving @entity20 in their tasting room			0
' it will also be served in @entity120 and in northern @entity44 , at our normal outlets - local restaurants and bars , ' he said			2
' the yeast seems quite wild and untamed , and the flavour is very belgianesque			0
' a portion of the profits from the venture are being donated to a fund that gives science equipment to underprivileged schools			0
the pair hope to collect wild yeast from south eastern @entity44 ’s @entity134 and come up with more palaeontology - themes beers .			2

the brew is called @entity20 and it is said to taste sweet and ' very @entity138 ' and will be served in *selected* bars in @entity44
two scientists swabbed an ancient whale fossil at the @entity73 in @entity75 to collect the *culture*
they had hoped to find a new species of yeast , but instead found a subspecies of @entity62 , which is used by breweries
