immigrants with more than one wife will qualify for extra benefits under reforms to @entity5 ’s welfare system , after an attempt to crack down on the problem backfired			1
polygamous marriages , largely confined to @entity10 families , are only recognised in @entity5 if they took place in countries where they are legal			2
currently , any additional wives can receive reduced individual income support , meaning the husband and his first wife are paid up to £ 111.45			2
error : the @entity20 ' reforms have inadvertently opened up a loophole for polygamous households subsequent spouses living under the same roof receive around £ 40			1
under the new system of @entity27 , which comes in next year , polygamous marriages will not be recognised at all			0
ministers pledged to end the ‘ absurd ’ benefits regime which has seen multiple wives allowed to claim extra welfare payments			1
but a @entity33 paper has highlighted a loophole in the rules which will allow additional wives to claim a full single person ’s allowance , currently worth up to £ 71 , while the original married couple will still get a married couple ’s allowance			1
the paper said : ‘ treating second and subsequent partners in polygamous relationships as separate claimants could mean that polygamous households receive more under @entity27 than under the current rules			0
’ the @entity20 admitted the loophole but said there were fewer than 50 polygamous families claiming benefits			1
the first @entity51 woman to receive a peerage , @entity50 , has spoken out widely on the issue of polygamous families claiming benefits			2
there are around 1,000 polygamous homes in @entity5 , the majority of which are @entity10 ' under @entity63 @entity62 law , polygamy is permissible			2
so a man can return to @entity66 , take another bride and then , in a repetition of the process , bring her to @entity70 where they also have children together — obtaining yet more money from the state , ' she wrote in the @entity75 last year			0
' because such @entity63 multiple - marriages are not recognised in @entity5 , the women are regarded by the welfare system as single mothers — and are therefore entitled to the full range of lone - parent payments			1
we can not continue like this			0
' why are they allowed to have more than one wife , ' she added			0
' we should prosecute one or two people for bigamy , that would sort it out			0
' currently in the @entity5 it is illegal to marry more than once			0
but if the multiple marriages took place abroad then it is not			0
a spokesman for the @entity20 told @entity96 said that the loophole will exist because extra wives in a polygamous home are treated as single			1
' polygamy is illegal in this country and it would be wrong for the benefits system to legitimise these arrangements by recognising them in any way , ' they said .			1

extra wives will soon be able to claim full single person *'s* benefits despite being married
government admits loophole will exist because of their reforms
they do not want to recognise polygamy in any way , so treat extra wives as single , they told @entity96
