by @entity0 appeal : lawyers for @entity3 , 40 , who was jailed for 33 years in 2007 for his part in the failed 2005 @entity6 bombings , are to appeal lawyers for one of the 21/7 bombers will appear before the @entity10 saying his conviction should be quashed because evidence used in the 2007 trial was unsound			1
@entity3 , 40 , who was arrested after the failed @entity6 bombings in 2005 , was jailed for 33 years in 2007 after admitting conspiracy to cause explosions			1
he pleaded guilty after jurors in the original trial - at which four men were found guilty of conspiracy to murder - were unable to reach a verdict on the part he played			1
tomorrow , @entity3 's legal team will argue that an expert witness used in the original trial used ' flawed ' evidence			2
on the day of the bombing , 21 july 2005 , four devices on trains and a bus around @entity6 failed to detonate , instead fizzing and popping			2
the defendants at the subsequent trial argued that they never intended them to go off , and were merely intended to be fake suicide attempts as a protest against the @entity40 invasion			0
forensic expert @entity41 had testified about the mix of chemicals the would - be bombers carried in their rucksacks			0
a prosecution witness , he testified that the devices were real and only failed to explode because the men had not mixed the ingredients , such as hydrogen peroxide and flour , in the right quantities			0
but @entity3 's lawyers will argue that methods used by mr @entity58 to obtain his evidence were ' not considered to be of sufficient quality ' by a senior forensic expert at the government - run @entity62 ( fel ) , the @entity55 reports			2
@entity64 , who went on to become chief scientist of the @entity62 , and his colleagues prepared a report in 2006 in which they wrote : ' dr @entity58 appears to have no quality system in place which would allow sufficient confidence to be placed in his findings and the validity of his results and therefore his conclusions '			0
@entity3 's lawyers will claim that he would never have been convicted if the @entity62 's doubts about mr @entity58 's evidence had been put to the jury			2
they will also put forward evidence that the @entity62 's doubts about mr @entity58 's evidence were put to anti-terrorist police officers , although a note about a meeting between @entity62 and police did note that any concerns were resolved			0
four 21/7 bombers were jailed for life , including @entity86 , left , and @entity87 ( shown at arrest ) @entity89 , left , and @entity90 , right , were jailed for life for their part in the failed 21/7 @entity6 bombings lawyers for the @entity95 ( @entity95 ) will argue that mr @entity58 's notes were made available to the defence team at the time of the trial			1
in 2010 mr @entity64 gave evidence in support of an attempt by @entity3 to have his sentence overturned			0
last year , an appeal judge turned down another appeal by @entity3 to have his sentence quashed , saying that at the original trial , the defence team knew about mr @entity58 's original mistakes and that he had apologised and remedied them , and that his work had been peer - reviewed			0
following the 2007 trial , @entity86 , then 29 , @entity90 , then 26 , @entity87 , then 25 , and @entity89 , then 28 , were found guilty of conspiracy to murder and each sentenced to life imprisonment			1
when jurors failed to reach a verdict on @entity3 , who was up on the same charge , he faced a retrial but then pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of conspiracy to cause explosions			1

@entity3 , 40 , was arrested following the failed 2005 @entity6 bombings
originally charged with conspiracy to murder but jury did *n't* reach verdict
four other men were found guilty of the charge and jailed for life in 2007
facing a retrial , @entity3 pleaded guilty to conspiracy to cause explosions
now his lawyers will argue that evidence from the 2007 trial was unsound
they will say a scientist called by the prosecution used ' flawed ' methods
the case will go before the @entity10 in @entity6 tomorrow
