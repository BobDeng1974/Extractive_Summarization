by @entity0 last month , the @entity1 accused @entity2 , who lives in @entity3 , a tiny town of just 345 people in the southwestern part of the state , of violating the @entity7 for damming up a creek and polluting water by building his pond			1
@entity2 , who works as a welder , built the pond five years ago , but he says , got permission to do so , including the right the dam up the @entity17 , from @entity19 state agencies			1
however , the @entity1 says he violated the @entity7 since he built a dam and failed to get approval from the @entity22			1
an aerial shot of @entity3 , @entity19 near the home of @entity2 who is fighting the @entity1 over accusations his homemade pond violates the law @entity2 , however , contends the @entity1 is applying the law incorrectly as he built a stock pond , which should make it exempt			1
' i think they ’re trying to gain jurisdiction , ' @entity2 told the @entity35			2
' they ’re trying to see if they can run over me , and then they will get into everyone ’s irrigation ditch and stock ponds throughout not only @entity19 , but the @entity42			0
' a @entity44 letter from 2012 appears to back up @entity2 's claim that he is not running foul of the law			1
' @entity50 permit is in good standing and is entitled to be exercised exactly as permitted , ' the letter reads , according to @entity52			0
although he received state approval , the @entity1 contends he failed to get the blessing of federal authorities who have the ultimate say			1
in addition , the @entity1 says that because @entity17 is tributary of the @entity61 , which itself a tributary of the @entity64 , it is part of the ' waters of the @entity42			0
' therefore , it falls under federal jurisdiction and the @entity7			0
the @entity1 regional office is housed in this federal building in @entity70 , @entity71 which covers western states including @entity19 @entity2 counters that 's a stretch as water in the creek is spread out and almost never makes it the 100 miles from @entity77 to the @entity64			1
' the pond does n't start in a river or end in a river , ' he said			0
the feds started getting on his case starting in 2012 after the @entity22 inspected the pond and concluded the dam he made ended up leading ' dredged and fill material			2
' @entity2 has appealed to @entity19 's two @entity87 senators , @entity88 and @entity89 for help			1
the pair wrote to the @entity1 on his behalf , but the agency is budging			2
and @entity2 is n't backing down either			2
' i want to stand up for what i believe in , for what i ’ve worked for , ' he said			0
' i feel like i ’m entitled to that			0
i pay taxes , i live in this country and i ’m going to fight it to the end '			0

@entity2 of @entity3 received approval from state agencies but @entity1 contends he failed to get ok from @entity22
the pond was built to stock fish which @entity2 says exempts him from the @entity7
the @entity1 says @entity2 dammed up a creek that 100 miles away empties into a large river and therefore makes pond applicable to law
@entity113 and @entity89 have *written* the @entity1 , but the agency is not backing down
