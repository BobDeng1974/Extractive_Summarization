in a bid to reinvigorate its flagging economy @entity0 is to loosen its strict retail regulations , keeping shops open seven days a week			2
the country 's regimented rules on sunday trading are rooted firmly in the tradition of keeping sunday as a rest day for workers , since a law on the matter was decreed in 1906			1
in 2009 , the rules were relaxed a little , and there are exceptions in some tourist destinations such as @entity16 and the south of @entity0 , but many shops are still shut on sundays			2
a draft bill , which was leaked to the @entity0 press this week , featured plans to deregulate the protected legal trade , a move to unveiled next month			1
economy minister @entity34 , a 36 - year old ex-banker , said : ' we must allow those who wish to work on sundays to do so , as long as they are suitably compensated in terms of wages and rest , because they want this extra work			0
' seven - day shopping : @entity27 is famous for its shopping , and @entity0 believes @entity16 can match that the bill would propose that shops can open on 12 sundays a year from five currently , with added flexibility for those located in big train stations and tourist areas ' of international stature '			1
the current rules are seen by many as old - fashioned , and some believe that extended trading hours will help create jobs and fight competition from internet shopping			0
but many @entity0 people are protective over their day of rest , including president @entity63 's @entity62 majority in parliament			1
the issue has led to protests and trials , with unions insisting it will hurt workers ' rights and small shopkeepers worried that they will not be able to compete against the major chains			0
the mayor of @entity16 , @entity74 , said the change in law will kill off small shops in the city centre - a ' key factor of the capital 's economic dynamism and attractiveness ' .			0
