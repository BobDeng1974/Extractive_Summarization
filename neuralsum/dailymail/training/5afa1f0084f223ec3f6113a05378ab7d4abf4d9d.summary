by @entity0 for @entity1 and @entity2 personal conflict , not religion , was the driving motive behind beard - and hair - cutting attacks targeting @entity8 , an appeals court panel ruled wednesday in overturning the hate - crime convictions of 16 men and women			1
a 6th @entity14 panel sided with arguments brought by attorneys for the @entity8 defendants , who were convicted two years ago in five attacks in 2011			1
the attacks were in apparent retaliation against @entity8 who had defied or denounced the authoritarian style of @entity23 , leader of the @entity25 community in eastern @entity26			1
he was given a 15 - year sentence for attacks on other members of the @entity8 community in a deeply divided decision , two of the three judges on the panel concluded that the jury received incorrect instructions about how to weigh the role of religion in the attacks			1
they also said prosecutors should have had to prove that the assaults would n't have happened but for religious motives			0
' when all is said and done , considerable evidence supported the defendants ' theory that interpersonal and intra-family disagreements , not the victims ' religious beliefs , sparked the attacks , ' the judges wrote			2
they said it was unfair to conclude that ' because faith permeates most , if not all , aspects of life in the @entity8 community , it necessarily permeates the motives for the assaults in this case			1
' church leaders , ' whether @entity66 or @entity67 , may do things , including committing crimes or even creating a new religion , for irreligious reasons , ' they wrote			0
@entity23 has served nearly three years of his 15 - year sentence , while seven other men in the community are serving between five and seven years in prison			2
the other eight @entity8 convicted in the attacks either already served one year in prison and have returned to their communities or are about to be released from two - year sentences			1
hearing : ( from left ) @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85 wait to make their pleas in @entity89 in @entity90 , @entity26 , in 2011 , during the hair - cutting trial			2
they were all eventually found guilty guilty : ( from left ) @entity84 , @entity81 and @entity82 , of @entity25 , @entity26 , all received jail sentences for beard - and - hair cutting defense attorney @entity98 , who represents the @entity8 , said she likely would be seeking the release of @entity23 and the seven other men as the government considers its appeal options			1
' @entity23 and the rest of the defendants pose no danger to the community , they do n't pose a flight risk , ' she said			0
' they 're needed at their homes			0
' @entity113 attorney @entity112 said prosecutors are ' reviewing the opinion and considering our options			0
' ' we respectfully disagree with the two judges who reversed the defendants ' hate crime convictions based on a jury instruction , ' he said			0
' we remain in awe of the courage of the victims in this case , who were subject to violent attacks by the defendants			0
' @entity8 , who live in rural communities organized around bishops , dress and live simply and shun many aspects of the modern age such as electricity , refrigeration and computers			2
they do n't drive and often get around in horse - drawn buggies or by paying drivers to shuttle them places			0
they believe the @entity144 instructs women to let their hair grow long and men to grow beards once they marry			1
cutting it is considered shameful and doing so forcibly is considered offensive			0
in a strong dissenting opinion of the @entity154 's wednesday ruling , judge @entity151 wrote that religion was a clear motive for the 2011 attacks and that the hate - crime convictions were appropriate , especially against @entity23			1
@entity159 quoted several statements made by @entity23 acknowledging his religious motivations , including in an interview with the @entity2 in which he said that the goal of the hair - cutting was to send a message to the @entity8 community and that he should be allowed to punish people who break church laws			1
the convictions of members of the @entity25 community marked the first involving religion under a federal hate crime statute enacted in 2009 in response to the murders of @entity176 because he was gay and @entity177 because he was black			1
attorneys for the @entity8 defendants have argued that the statute was meant for egregious offenses motivated by race , sexual orientation and religion , not for what their clients did			1
' the impetus behind the hate - crime statute , the @entity176 tragedy and @entity189 - those are heinous , egregious , tragic crimes , and i think in responding to those crimes , ( the statute ) is a little overbroad , and i think it can have an effect that perhaps @entity198 did n't intend , ' @entity98 said			2
' this is a really good case that exemplifies where that line can be drawn of what is a hate crime and what is not a hate crime			0
' the ruling will make it more difficult for federal prosecutors to obtain hate - crime convictions , because the court made it clear evidence must show the crime was based solely on religious hatred , said @entity215 , an @entity216 law professor			2
' it 's always hard to prove state of mind or motive of a defendant , ' @entity215 said			0
' now it 's going to be even harder because you have to prove not only was this a reason why they did it , you have to prove this is essentially the only reason , or the motivating reason			0
' at sentencing , judge @entity228 said it was clear to him and the jury that the attacks were motivated by religion and that ' anyone who says this is just a hair - and beard - cutting case was n't paying any attention			1
' ' these victims were terrorized and traumatized , ' he said			0
' ( the attacks ) were calculated to inflict the maximum emotional trauma and distress on the victims , and that 's what they did			0

sixteen @entity8 men and women were jailed in 2011 for attacking other @entity8
they *viciously* cut the beards and hair of other members of their community
a court at the time ruled that the attacks were hate crimes
court of appeals has now ruled that personal conflict motivated the attacks
