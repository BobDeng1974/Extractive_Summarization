by @entity0 follow @ @entity1 @entity2 sat down with his tie slackened and puffed his ruddied cheeks , without speaking he had given his first answer – relief			1
for having been the man who triumphantly ended @entity10 's 110 - year wait for @entity12 football , it would have been galling to see their dreams shattered after just seven days of continental competition			1
they were 10 minutes away from such ignominy when substitute @entity18 struck his first goal since last september			1
and @entity2 said : ' you 're always worried at 1 - 1 with 15 minutes to go			1
' for all the hype and euphoria we very nearly fell at the first fence			2
but we stuck at it , like we always do , and got there			2
' it had , however , been a struggle			2
@entity42 was then guilty of three glaring misses before @entity44 rose to flash home a header from @entity48 's centre on 27 minutes			2
the second - half , however , was in danger of drifting to a sorry conclusion until @entity2 injected some energy in the form of @entity18 and @entity54			1
and , with 80 minutes on the clock , @entity44 escaped down the right , centred for @entity57 to nod back across goal and @entity18 was on hand to apply an uncompromising finish			1
' i honestly believe that the ability to bring people off the bench won us the game , ' @entity2 added			2
match winner : @entity18 scores his side 's second goal during @entity71 qualifying @entity72 : @entity73 celebrates with @entity18 at the end of the match ' bringing on @entity18 and @entity54 gave us a freshness and i 'm delighted he ( @entity18 ) got the winner			1
' he looked the best he has in seven years , physically			0
' i 'm delighted that he 's scored a goal			1
we all know the kid has terrific ability			0
let 's hope he stays injury - free because he will be a big player for us if he does			0
' @entity2 went on : ' we got off to an awful start and that put everyone on edge for 25 minutes			0
' we missed three or four glorious chances and you do think “ are we going to get it ? ”			0
' but thankfully we did and i 'm pleased more than anything for the supporters			0
fresh legs : @entity54 is congratulated by @entity96 after providing the cross for the second goal ' a guy came up to me before the game and said “ i never thought i 'd ever see this day ” and that 's fabulous			0
' @entity10 will learn the identity of their playoff - round opponent today but , while @entity2 expects an improvement on what was an unconvincing display , he is still keen to add to his squad			1
' i always knock the door			0
the day i say “ no ” is the day i might as well pack in , ' he said			0
' if there is a bit of quality i will always try			0
' on the evidence of this performance , he might just need one or two more to keep alive the dream of @entity116 coming to @entity117 this season .			1

@entity18 scored late winner to secure victory over @entity122
@entity10 are one round away from the @entity71 group stages
the dream of @entity116 coming to @entity117 this season is still alive
