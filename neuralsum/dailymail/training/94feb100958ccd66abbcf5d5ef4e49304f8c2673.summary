by @entity0 , @entity1 on sunday political correspondent home secretary @entity3 faced a revolt last night after one of her own ministers refused to implement a drugs ban			1
liberal democrat drugs minister @entity9 is defying mrs may ’s order to criminalise khat , a plant chewed to give users a high and used predominantly in @entity15 immigrant communities			1
mr @entity9 – who once said cannabis was ‘ no more harmful than alcohol or tobacco ’ – has told mrs may he disagrees with her plan to ban the substance , and flatly refused to act on it			2
clash : @entity3 has since stripped @entity9 ( right ) of responsibility for criminalising the drug khat his rebellion has forced mrs may to strip him of responsibility for enforcing the ban and give it to organised crime minister @entity31 , a @entity32 who holds more hardline views			1
mr @entity9 ’s refusal is a demonstration of his political rift with mrs may , who was said to be ‘ spitting tacks ’ at the @entity40 ’s appointment to her department last autumn			2
drug : @entity45 farmer @entity44 with a khat plant in 2003 he is distinctly to her @entity47 on a number of issues , including immigration controls and ‘ snooping ’ powers			0
mrs may is planning to categorise khat as a class c drug , which would make its importation , possession and supply a criminal offence			2
she last week rejected calls for a rethink from the @entity62 , whose chair , @entity64 mp @entity63 , has spoken of chewing khat in the past			0
it argued there was no compelling evidence the drug was harmful – and police would risk ‘ antagonism ’ when targeting communities which use it			0
some experts , however , have linked khat to depression , irritability , psychotic episodes and violence			1
last summer the government ’s @entity80 also recommended that khat not be criminalised			0
but mrs may has said her decision is based on an ‘ extensive consultation process ’			0
mr @entity9 insisted last night the khat ban was not part of his portfolio because the decision was made before he joined the department			1
but a @entity40 source said mr @entity9 had told mrs may face - to - face he opposed her decision			1
‘ the fact that @entity91 covers organised crime , which is sort of linked to the khat trade , was his get - out - of - jail card , ’ the source said			0
despite their differences , mr @entity9 ’s friends say that he ‘ gets on well with mrs may on a personal level ’ .			0

the drug is chewed to give users in immigrant communities a small high
home secretary *wanted* it made class - c for ' links to psychotic episodes '
but drugs minister @entity9 said that would antagonise communities
