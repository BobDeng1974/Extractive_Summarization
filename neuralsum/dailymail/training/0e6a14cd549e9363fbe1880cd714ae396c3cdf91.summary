by @entity0 you may be forgiven for thinking this image is a @entity4 painting but it is , in fact , a @entity8 computer model of an 1885 @entity10 masterpiece			1
graphic designer @entity11 created the full 3d rendering using painter @entity14 's battle scene @entity16 , also known as the recapture of @entity18			1
it took a month to digitally map the scene , and a further five weeks to paint and mask the digital model			0
it began as a challenge from his wife and took a month to model the 32 characters , followed by five weeks spent painting and masking the project @entity34 was a late 19th century @entity10 painter			1
he painted the @entity35 , also known as the recapture of @entity18 , pictured , in 1885 which depicts the siege of the @entity18 in 1686			2
@entity34 was renowned for painting portraits of kings and aristocrats @entity34 was a late 19th century @entity10 painter			2
he helped paint the @entity42 and @entity43 frescoes in @entity44 and commissioned by @entity45 to paint @entity47 themes			0
@entity34 was renowned for painting portraits of kings and aristocrats			0
his 1885 painting @entity16 , also known as the recapture of @entity18 , shows the 1686 siege of @entity18 featuring prince @entity52			1
@entity11 said : ' this project started as a funny challenge from my wife , but became something more			1
' we were on holiday solving riddles , and there was a medieval painting in the booklet			2
' my wife asked me if i could [ produce ] it in @entity8 ? ! i said yes , of course			0
@entity11 began by analysing a high - resolution copy of @entity34 's painting he found on @entity67 , before plotting the positions of each character in @entity8 on his home computer			1
he started modelling characters using what ’s called a full rig that could be moved and animated , but admitted his pc could only handle these animations for up to nine of the 32 characters			1
@entity11 began by analysing a high - resolution copy of the painting he found on @entity67 , before plotting the positions of each character in @entity8 on his home computer , pictured using static modelling techniques @entity11 plotted each of the characters , pictured , on so - called displacement maps that are used to showcase depth and height			1
once all of the characters were plotted , @entity11 rendered colours in the images using the digital copy of the painting instead , he resorted to detailed , static modelling techniques and plotted each of the characters on so - called displacement maps that are used to showcase depth and height			1
once all of the characters were plotted , @entity11 rendered colours in the images using the digital copy of the painting			1
he then had to repaint sections of the characters that were obstructed using a clone stamp tool that copied and transferred colours from other regions of the rendered painting			2
to create the smoke effect , @entity11 filmed footage of smoke using a camera and two led lights			0
this footage was uploaded and stills from it were added to the model using a mask layer			0
the project began as a challenge from @entity11 ' wife and took the @entity10 graphic designer a month to model the 32 characters			1
this was then followed by five weeks spent painting and masking the project			2
the different masks and rendering processes are pictured once all of the characters were plotted , pictured , @entity11 then had to repaint sections of the characters that were obstructed using a clone stamp tool which copied and transferred colours from other regions the modelling took a month to complete , while the painting and masking took an extra five weeks			1

‘ during the creation i made a few bad decisions , but it was extremely useful and instructive , ' added @entity11			0
‘ seeing this kind of popularity i decided to make another one now i know the obstacles , and the parts that i have to make differently			0
' maybe a 2.5 d version could look better ? but i wanted to make it in full @entity8 ; for my wife , and for myself of course			0
’ the full step - by - step process can be found on @entity11 ' blog in @entity10 , and an @entity149 version is available from @entity150 .			2

3d rendering is based on @entity14 ’s painting @entity16 , also known as the recapture of @entity18
it was created by @entity10 graphic designer @entity11
the project began as a challenge from @entity11 ' wife while on holiday
@entity11 spent two months modelling and painting each of the 32 characters
