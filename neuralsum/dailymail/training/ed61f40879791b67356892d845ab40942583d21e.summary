researchers at the @entity9 in @entity10 have unveiled four small pills they say have the same bowel - cleansing effect of the previously prescribed self - cleansing liquid required before the cancer screening			0
the unpleasant process of drinking several litres of the liquid laxatives has been linked to patients delaying or skipping the cancer 's recommending screening all together , according to the doctors			1
' some become so anxious about drinking so much liquid that they avoid the entire procedure , putting them at risk of undiagnosed cancer , ' the clinic states			0
but now with the four tiny pills , pictured the size of a round aspirin , there 's another option which they say provides the same results of standard liquid laxatives			1
