in a year littered with trophies , baubles , mementos and achievements , a simple letter perhaps means as much as anything to @entity6			1
that @entity8 team captain @entity7 should take time to write to one of his @entity12 rookies , the local lad who left @entity13 without a point but with a headful of memories , said something about more than just the @entity19 ’s inspired leadership			1
if some might feel that @entity6 may have regrets over his contribution to the home win , a foursomes defeat alongside @entity26 on the opening morning and then a singles loss to a turbocharged @entity30 on the sunday , the 40 - year - old is at pains to dispel the myth			1
@entity6 poses with the @entity33 after his triumph earlier this year the @entity35 , whose best year as a pro was rewarded with honorary membership of the @entity38 yesterday , says even that dysfunctional pairing with @entity26 — something @entity7 concedes was never given the pre-event time to develop — remains a fond recollection of his week in the @entity44 hills			1
‘ i would n’t take it back , ’ said @entity6			1
‘ it was absolutely brilliant , playing with @entity26			1
@entity7 ’s reasoning was that he told me i was playing the first morning			1
‘ and he said : “ you ’re standing there with the @entity50 on and @entity26 has n’t been on form as normal — and the big crowd is what he loves to get him up to play his best			1
he ’s out with you and you ’ll have a massive following ”			2
@entity6 savoured the home support at @entity13 despite his disappointing display ‘ he just thought that would be the spur and it obviously did n’t work			1
but neither of us played well			2
we only had one birdie			2
but i have no negativity about the @entity12 — only positives			1
i would n’t change it for anything			2
‘ @entity7 sent me a text first and then a letter at the race to @entity69			1
he wrote everybody a letter			2
i ’ll probably not show it to many people because it ’s personal and it ’s a mark of the man			0
‘ he talked to me about how i handled being left out on the saturday , as did a few of my peers			0
there are 12 guys and you leave your egos at the door			1
it ’s purely the result that you want and it does n’t matter how it happens			0
‘ yes , i would have liked to have played a bit more			0
but would i swap that and get beat ? no , i would n’t			0
@entity6 ( left ) jokes with @entity30 during the pair 's foursomes match at the @entity12 ‘ @entity90 , that was probably as good as i ’ve played all year			1
but you are playing one of the top guys outwith @entity95 — what is it he ’s got , five or six majors ? also , if he does n’t go out and beat me , he ca n’t have a go at @entity100 , who would have just turned around and said : “ well , you got beat ... ” ‘ i held my head up high and i enjoyed it			0
i desperately want to play in the @entity12 again			1
‘ @entity7 ’s given me a lot of confidence , not just with the letter and text			1
we ’ve been in contact a lot			0
the stuff he said has been brilliant			0
’ @entity111 took to @entity112 to show off his @entity114 - themed outfit with @entity114 's @entity115 after the win @entity6 ends 2014 as world no 35 , up 31 places in 12 months , while his @entity120 earnings of £ 1.35million have been bolstered by eight top - 10 finishes — including becoming the first player to defend the @entity123			1
more impressive than anything , though , was his ferocious — and exhausting — charge to the brink of automatic @entity12 qualification			1
missing out by the narrowest of margins , he was , the captain has since admitted , @entity7 ’s first pick as a wild card			1
‘ i ’m definitely ready for a break , ’ said the third member of @entity134 ’ s great @entity12 trio , following @entity136 and his own uncle , @entity137 , into the famous team event			1
‘ this year , it ’s one that ’s going to be hard to top , you know			1
i ’m going to have to work even harder and really be on the ball			0
@entity8 quartet ( from left ) @entity111 , @entity6 , @entity145 and @entity146 celebrate as @entity8 win the @entity12 at @entity13 ‘ but the key is not to panic and try to do too much			1
i ’ve done a lot this year			2
i think i had a first , second , third , fourth , fifth , sixth , seventh and eighth			0
‘ i ’m very close			0
i just need to keep doing what i ’m doing			0
‘ you never look back			0
you know you ’ve had a good year — but all you ’re trying to do is bottle that formula			2
‘ you do n’t end up 34th or 35th in the world by having one good year			1
you ’ve got to have two or three good years , or it cascades away			0
@entity157 take time out amid wild celebrations to pose for group photo at @entity13 ‘ i ’m getting more consistent			1
i just want to improve slightly in places — that wee bit here and there — and who knows , you could be in the top 10 as quick as that			2
it ’s such a fine margin			0
‘ last year i had to chase the world points , so i was a wee bit out of my comfort zone playing in @entity170 when i did n’t really want to then , at the end , i played eight out of nine weeks			1
‘ but it ’s testament to the physical work i ’ve done that i could do that			0
one of the keys at the start of the year was having no injuries so i could dictate my schedule , play more if i need to			2
i ’ve not had a twinge for a year			2
that ’s a massive breakthrough			0
@entity7 and his players pose for disheveled group photo after living up to their bill as favourites against the @entity170 ‘ you look at a football player who spends three weeks out			1
it can sometimes take them four or five weeks to get back			0
so , if i had to miss three of the biggest weeks , then there ’s more pressure on me when i come back			0
and , if i don ’ t settle right away , that ’s two months lost , is n’t it ? ‘ i did n’t want any distractions			1
i wanted to play when i wanted , not when i felt like i needed time off			0
i feel as fresh at the end of the year as i did at the start of the year			2
that ’s a massive change			0
‘ generally , i get to the end of the year and feel a wreck			2
i cannae hit a shot			0
now , i ’ve had a week and a bit off just to give the golfing muscles a break			0
it did n't take long for the champagne to start flowing after the trophy had been raised ‘ the one thing i ’ve learned this year is that my bad shots are better			2
i ’m swinging better and hitting the ball better , so i ’m pin high more			0
all the good putters give themselves chances			0
it ’s hard if you ’re hitting it to 40 feet			2
‘ my game is improving , and it comes down to putting			0
‘ i went to see ( short game guru ) @entity215 and he made a difference , so i ’ ll try to see him again in january for a refresher			0
