by @entity0 published : 07:13 est , 12 september 2013 updated : 16:46 est , 12 september 2013 a town council has been ordered to move a new war memorial because it breaches planning regulations – despite being just yards from a monument to those who died in the two world wars			1
@entity7 has been told it faces criminal prosecution after it put up the 6ft monument to commemorate those who have died fighting for their country since 1945 without planning permission from @entity15			1
the memorial to the soldiers of the @entity19 and @entity20 regiments is in the shadow of @entity22			1
the war memorial , pictured , was built without permission 15ft away from the wall of @entity22 ( right ) but although the council owns the land surrounding it , the ruin itself is recognised by law as a ‘ scheduled ’ – or listed – monument			1
the @entity33 rules it is a criminal offence to carry out works to listed monuments – such as erecting the memorial – without consent from the secretary of state			1
the council defended the move , claiming it did not realise the @entity42 had specially protected status			2
@entity15 has now demanded the memorial be moved – and it refused to rule out prosecution should a solution not be found			1
the quango said it was a ‘ criminal offence ’ to build the monument so close to the historic 9th - century abbey			2
the council may have to move the war memorial after @entity53 heritage pointed out their mistake the council could be fined up to £ 5,000			1
the 1979 @entity33 does not allow for retrospective planning consent to be given			0
the memorial was built of expensive white @entity59 stone , and £ 20,000 of its cost was covered by public donations			2
the @entity33 makes it a crime to carry out works to listed monuments without consent from the secretary of state			0
anyone convicted under the act can face fines of up to £ 5,000			0
@entity15 has demanded the 8ft monument be moved to a different location , and has refused to rule out prosecution			1
the £ 30,000 monument was erected 15ft away from historic @entity22 an @entity15 spokesman said : ‘ under the @entity33 , it is a criminal offence to carry out works to a @entity79 without @entity80 from the secretary of state			1
' @entity15 is taking this matter seriously but our focus is on achieving a negotiated solution			2
' there is no facility under the @entity88 for the @entity81 to issue retrospective @entity80 and so the matter of unauthorised works and criminal offence stands until the situation is satisfactorily resolved			0
' wherever possible , a negotiated solution is preferable and this is what we are currently pursuing with the @entity7			0
although @entity98 owns the land the memorial was built on , its proximity to a protected building means it needed special permission ‘ i am sure this was put up with the best of intentions , and we have had constructive discussions with @entity98 about resolving the issue of unauthorised works involving the erection of a stone memorial at a @entity79 known as @entity22			1
‘ @entity111 is looking at options for moving the memorial in consultation with interested parties			0
’ @entity116 , the mayor of @entity22 , said : ‘ @entity111 is currently in constructive discussions with @entity15 to resolve the issue of the new memorial recently erected on @entity120 within the @entity79 of @entity22			1
‘ due to an oversight this was carried out without having obtained @entity80			0
the memorial is just 4ft away from a wall surrounding @entity22 , which is now mostly a ruin			2
a statue of @entity127 has been erected there , and the tower of another church can be seen in the background ' we are confident that a negotiated solution can be reached with @entity15 and the @entity7 is looking at options , working together with @entity15 , the @entity135 , @entity136 and the @entity137 to find the right location for the memorial			2
’ @entity22 was founded by @entity127 in 888 ad and his daughter @entity140 was the first abbess there			0
the only part of the abbey that remains today is the excavated ruins of the abbey church within a walled garden , home to the @entity149			0
under the @entity33 , carrying out works on protected buildings is a crime if permission is not sought			2
the legislation is designed to protect sites deemed to be of ' national importance ' from unnecessary development			0
there are no fixed rules stating what distance away from a protected building works can be freely carried out , but in this case the small distance between the memorial and the wall of the abbey would appear to mean the land was covered by the act			1
more than 20,000 buildings are on the ‘ schedule ’ in @entity53 alone including @entity171 in @entity172 , the missile shelter at @entity174 and @entity175 in @entity176			0
in order to carry out works on any scheduled monument , permission must be granted by a secretary of state , and people who break the rules face fines of up to £ 5,000			0
in 2006 a man was fined £ 1,230 for dumping waste on a protected hill fort in @entity188 , @entity176 , which was also a breach of the @entity190 .			0

@entity98 has built the war memorial just 15ft from the historic @entity22
@entity42 is a protected building , and carrying out works *nearby* may be an offence
@entity15 refuse to rule out prosecution over the blunder
