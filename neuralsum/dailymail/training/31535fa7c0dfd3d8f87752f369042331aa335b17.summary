by @entity0 follow @ @ marthakelner @entity1 , named after a @entity3 princess , will assume the throne of current queen of the court @entity7 if she wins @entity8 on saturday			1
their similarities are manifold , from their steely focus and striking looks to an ice - cold ambition to reach the top — even if that means cutting loose old friends			2
@entity1 is 13th seed at @entity8 , the same as @entity7 was when she won here in 2004			1
but @entity1 is more interested in emulating @entity20			1
‘ i ’ve worked really hard in my life , ’ said @entity1 , ‘ so i appreciate other people who have done the same and have these amazing dreams and actually work hard and go out and achieve them			1
‘ she came from nothing and built herself up to this huge empire and the richest woman in the world			2
i love rags - to - riches stories like that			2
’ @entity1 is not from a poverty - stricken background , but the 20 - year - old from @entity52 , @entity53 , is no stranger to hard work and is now on the brink of building her own @entity20 - style empire			1
she is already being courted by multinational corporations , but @entity1 is keen to emphasise this is not a story of overnight success			1
aged 12 , she moved with her family to a tennis academy in @entity63 run by coach @entity64 , forgoing the usual thrills of high school life enjoyed by twin sister @entity67			0
‘ it was my full - time job at 12 years old , ’ she said , ‘ but it was n’t a sad time			2
i was really excited for the opportunity and i wanted to improve my tennis			0
i was happy to play tennis all day long			0
’ professional : @entity1 has the same tunnel - vision focus in training as she does in matches			1
@entity78 meets @entity1 in showpiece sponsorship : endorsement deals could earn @entity1 tens of millions each year @entity1 , like @entity7 , is the consummate professional			1
she has the same tunnel - vision focus in training as she does in matches			2
friday morning at the @entity85 practice courts at the @entity86 , she completed her last full practice before the biggest match of her life			0
on the hottest day of the year , @entity1 went through the motions with @entity64 , who is now her full - time coach			1
for an hour she went full tilt , taking the ball early and aggressively just as she does during matches			0
@entity94 were in good spirits — a far cry from her final practice before her @entity99 semi-final against @entity100			2
on that occasion tempers were frayed and she stormed off court after a cross word with @entity64			0
‘ she ’s great , she ’s in good shape , ready to go and she wo n’t be overawed by the occasion , ’ said @entity64			0
‘ she ’s one of the best athletes i ’ve ever worked with			0
she dictates play , her agility and her hand - eye coordination are exceptional and she picks up things on the fly so she can easily adapt			0
’ @entity1 is gaining fans with every victory but she does not have many friends in the locker room			1
shining : @entity1 swept her opponent aside on @entity118 to seal a spot in saturday 's final embrace : @entity1 and @entity121 shake hands after their semi-final clash on @entity118 when she won junior @entity8 two years ago , @entity1 stayed at the home of @entity3 star @entity125			1
they became close as they rose through the ranks together , but relations have soured between the pair , reportedly due to jealousy over @entity64 , who is also part of @entity134 ’s coaching team			0
while @entity134 has been sidelined since january , @entity1 has soared up the rankings and become @entity64 ’s no 1 project			1
when asked if she and @entity134 were still good friends , @entity1 replied bluntly : ‘ no , i do n’t think so			1
i think you can work out what happened			0
i ’ll leave it at that			0
’ @entity28 , who won @entity8 in 2011 , does not have the same cold outlook on life			1
‘ of course i think it is possible to have friends on tour , ’ she said , ‘ i have many so i ’m definitely not against that			0
’ the @entity148 was ruthless in dispatching three of her compatriots — @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity153 — on her way to the final			0
‘ i know them well but i do n’t really know @entity1 , ’ she said , ‘ i do n’t speak to her but i know she ’s playing well and that ’s what matters			2

@entity27 starlet takes on @entity28 in her first @entity30 final
she can assume the throne of current queen of the court @entity7
@entity1 is now on the brink of building her own @entity20 - style empire
