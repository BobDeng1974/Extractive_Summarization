published : 06:12 est , 14 september 2012 updated : 06:39 est , 14 september 2012 medical history : the research in @entity2 could make the jab a thing of a past some people hate them , some people fear them , and the rest of us probably do n't enjoy them that much			0
but needle injections could finally become medical history , after scientists found a way to use lasers to take the ' ouch ! ' out of a medicine jab			1
the process , developed at @entity18 in @entity19 , could revolutionise how we receive annual flu shots , childhood immunisations , and other treatments that involve piercing the skin with a needle			1
the laser - based system blasts microscopic jets of drugs directly into the skin , and the creators say it is as gentle and painless as ' being hit with a puff of air '			1
the system uses an ' yttrium aluminum garnet ' laser to propel a tiny , precise stream of medicine with just the right amount of force			1
this type of laser is commonly used by dermatologists , particularly for facial esthetic treatments			1
now @entity45 , a professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering , has combined the laser with a small adaptor that contains the drug to be delivered , in liquid form , plus a chamber containing water that acts as a ' driving ' fluid			1
each laser pulse , which lasts just 250 millionths of a second , generates a vapor bubble inside the driving fluid			1
the pressure of that bubble puts elastic strain on the membrane between the water and drug , causing the drug to be forcefully ejected from a miniature nozzle in a narrow jet			0
the jet is a mere 150 millionths of a meter ( micrometers ) in diameter , just a little larger than the width of a human hair			0
the beam entrance view of the laser injector : the technology could end the jab forever @entity45 said : ' the impacting jet pressure is higher than the skin tensile strength and thus causes the jet to smoothly penetrate into the targeted depth underneath the skin , without any splashback of the drug			2
' tests on guinea pig skin show that the drug - laden jet can penetrate up to several millimeters beneath the skin surface , with no damage to the tissue			0
because of the narrowness and quickness of the jet , it should cause little or no pain , @entity45 said - ' however , our aim is the epidermal layer , ' which is located closer to the skin surface , at a depth of only about 500 micrometers			0
tested in gel : the laser creates a hole in the gel ( the black line ) before the drug is injected this region of the skin has no nerve endings , so the method ' will be completely pain - free '			1
in previous studies , the researchers used a laser wavelength that was not well absorbed by the water of the driving liquid , causing the formation of tiny shock waves that dissipated energy and hampered the formation of the vapor bubble			2
in the new work , @entity45 and colleagues use a laser with a wavelength of 2,940 nanometers , which is readily absorbed by water			2
this allows the formation of a larger and more stable vapor bubble " which then induces higher pressure on the membrane , " he said			0
' this is ideal for creating the jet and significantly improves skin penetration			0
' although other research groups have developed similar injectors , ' they are mechanically driven ' , using piston - like devices to force drugs into the skin , which gives less control over the jet strength and the drug dosage			2
' the laser - driven microjet injector can precisely control dose and the depth of drug penetration underneath the skin			2
' control via laser power is the major advancement over other devices , i believe			0
' @entity45 is now working with a company to produce low - cost replaceable injectors for clinical use .			0

@entity19 team creates laser that uses ' just the right amount of force ' to inject medicine
*future* jabs could be as painful as ' a puff of fresh air '
