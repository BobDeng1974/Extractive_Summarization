@entity0 are in pole position to clinch a world record kit deal with @entity3			1
senior insiders at the @entity6 sportswear giant believe a £ 60million - a - year deal has all but been agreed , even though current sponsors @entity8 retain the right to match any offer and extend a partnership that dates back to 2002 with @entity3			1
that , however , is thought to be unlikely when @entity8 are sure to question whether it is worth more than doubling their original £ 300m 10 - year deal – which expires in june 2015 – when the deposed champions are going through this difficult period of transition			1
negotiations with @entity8 have been going on for the last three years , but when their exclusive negotiating period expired last autumn that opened the door for companies like adidas and warrior			2
it is adidas who are now prepared to sign off the biggest football club kit deal in history in the belief that @entity3 ’s global appeal remains undamaged by a disastrous domestic season that culminated in the dismissal of manager @entity61			0
imminent : @entity62 is expected to be announced as @entity3 boss this week deal : @entity21 have a 10 - year £ 300m sponsorship deal with adidas @entity32 , the @entity3 executive vice chairman , has been busy recruiting a replacement , with @entity62 ’s appointment thought to be imminent			0
but @entity32 and the club 's commercial director @entity35 know they need to sign off the next kit deal as soon as possible too , simply because the sheer demand for @entity3 merchandise means production needs to begin sooner rather than later			0
a deal with adidas would still give @entity3 the freedom to create a separate fashion brand , with @entity80 company @entity79 thought to be close to completing their own deal .			0
