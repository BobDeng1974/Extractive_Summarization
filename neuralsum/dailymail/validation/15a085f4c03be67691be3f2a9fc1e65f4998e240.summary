the @entity1 contract situation at @entity2 is coming to the boil , after the latest snub from the player ’s representatives , and an indication that talks wo n’t resume until the summer			1
@entity9 says he ’s relaxed but i find that hard to believe			0
he wo n’t want to lose @entity1 , a talent that he can rightly be proud of , and justifiably claim he has helped turn into a star quality player			2
but i ca n’t understand why @entity2 have consistently put the message out that there will not be a problem with the @entity1 situation			1
the outcome of that policy is that @entity1 looks greedy – why do the football club want to make one of their star players look bad in the eyes of the supporters ? @entity1 's contract situation at @entity2 is unlikely to be resolved until the summer @entity1 and his representatives are understood to have knocked back the latest £ 100,000 - a - week offer @entity29 look knackered ... @entity30 must start putting his faith in youth or he 'll blow the @entity33 if you view @entity35 as anything other than a fantastic player then you have no passion for football so now there is a situation locally with fans and the press are questioning his representatives , with the @entity46 declaring this week that @entity1 ‘ needs to ask who is looking after his best interests			1
’ the answer to that question is simple			0
in football terms , @entity2 have looked after him			2
in the same way @entity54 looked after him before he was snapped up by the @entity57 , and in the same way @entity58 might look after him if they choose to pay big money			2
@entity2 ca n’t expect too much loyalty from a player who was happy to leave @entity54 after seven years at @entity63			0
what goes around comes around , i guess			0
in financial terms - his agent is looking after his best interests , obviously			0
he ’s got a family , he wants to set himself up comfortably for the rest of his life , and i ca n’t think of a reason why a player should n’t be allowed to do that			0
@entity9 says he is relaxed about @entity1 's contract situation at @entity2 @entity1 left @entity54 after seven years at the club @entity1 ’s contract runs out in 2017 and there is no way @entity2 will want this impasse to continue			1
if he even approaches the final year of his current deal without this being resolved , @entity2 could lose out			2
the days of a player accepting less than he feels he is worth because he is at a great club that gave him a big opportunity are long gone			0
it ’s naive to think otherwise			0
a five - year deal of £ 100,000 a week has been rejected by @entity1			1
@entity88 is on £ 150,000 a week			1
is there a reason why @entity1 should n’t be on the same as @entity88 ? @entity1 is younger , but i ’m not sure why age should come into it			1
@entity1 has proved he can be a match winner , a key player and is a regular starter for @entity2 – same as @entity88			1
@entity1 ’s fitness record is considerably better , which is unfortunate for @entity88 , but when an agent is negotiating on behalf of his player it is definitely something which counts in @entity1 ’s favour			1
the big difference between the careers of @entity88 and @entity1 is that @entity1 has proved himself at a much younger age			2
why should he accept a less lucrative deal because of that ? makes no sense			0
if a player is committing to a club long - term , then the deal has to be right			0
the figures are ridiculous – but this is the @entity33 where players ' salaries are abnormally high			0
and to expect @entity1 to launch his own one - man crusade for fairer wages in football is laughable			2
@entity88 is on a contract believed to worth £ 150,000 per week at @entity2 @entity121 has eye on second place it ’s a harsh reality for some who have n’t quite caught up with how modern football works , but @entity1 is an excellent footballer , and his agent is working for his player to get the best deal for him			1
by making the offer of £ 100,000 a week , @entity2 have told @entity1 that he is two - thirds of the player @entity88 is			1
if the agent had accepted that then @entity1 would surely have sacked him .			0

@entity1 is *stalling* over signing a new contract at @entity2
