by @entity0 published : 08:04 est , 6 february 2014 @entity2 : 08:22 est , 6 february 2014 pope @entity3 will be made a saint in april pope @entity3 spent decades constantly questioning whether he was worthy of the role , according to private diaries published yesterday			1
@entity3 , who led the @entity7 from 1978 until his death in 2005 , will be made a saint in april and remains for many @entity7 a towering model of faith and commitment			1
the diaries , which he requested were destroyed , give a glimpse into his private spiritual life , showing a man who never became complacent despite the grandeur of the papacy and his star status among many @entity21 instead he agonised about whether he was doing enough			1
his handwritten notes , published as ' @entity3 : i am very much in @entity25 's hands			1
personal notes 1962 - 2003 ' , are a series of his reflections rather than a daily diary			2
although he played a very active public role in communist - era @entity31 and as pope , the man born @entity3 in southern @entity31 in 1920 rarely referred to public events in these pages			1
in one note in 1981 , the then @entity36 reflected on a theological discussion with other clerics and asked : ' @entity40			2
do i love the word of @entity25 ? do i live by it ? do i serve it willingly			2
help me , @entity45 , to live by your word , " he asked			2
" do i serve the @entity48 that lives in the @entity7 ? ' in the same passage , he wrote , alternating between @entity50 and his native @entity31 : ' a pure , holy and immaculate sacrifice			1
this is why he demands from his priests that they should be of undivided heart ( celibate ) and demands priestly purity			2
@entity57 , help me ! ' before his death , @entity3 entrusted his diaries to archbishop @entity60 , his personal secretary and now a cardinal in the southern city of @entity63 , with instructions that they be burned			1
in the foreword to the book , @entity60 said he did not burn them because they hold the key to understanding the pope 's private spiritual life			1
pope @entity3 pictured with his secretary archbishop @entity60 ' they reveal the other side of the person whom we knew as			1
. the pastor of the universal @entity7 , ' wrote the cardinal , who was both praised and criticised in @entity31 @entity80 circles after announcing the publication of the book last month			1
now available only in @entity31 , the 638 - page book is dominated by deep theological reflections that reveal little of what the pope was otherwise thinking or doing when he wrote them			0
archbishop @entity60 said he did not burn them because they hold the key to understanding the pope 's private spiritual life the picture that emerges deepens but does not jar with his public image , in contrast to the posthumous diaries of @entity98 - who died in 1997 and was beatified by @entity3 in 2003 - that revealed her long periods of doubt about @entity25 's existence			1
despite the questioning of his own role , there is no sign in the diaries from 1962 to 2003 that the pope 's belief in @entity25 wavered			1
the first signs of his questioning appear in comments from 1970 where he wrote : " can the misfortunes of people close to me , which have happened recently , be seen as a punishment ? as a sign ? what can it mean ? " he paid close attention to the skills required of a priest			0
" what language do i use when i speak to people ? " he asked in 1974			0
" do i proclaim the @entity131 with complete conviction ? " in his final years , debilitated by illness , the pope 's entries become sparser and the handwriting less assured			0
the last entry in 2003 referred to the @entity139 story of @entity140 , who was ordered by @entity25 to preach his word but instead runs away			0
the pope , who before his final illness travelled tirelessly around the globe preaching the @entity131 , wrote in a sloping script in @entity146 across the bottom of the page : ' @entity140 , this is the fear of proclaiming the love of @entity25			0
' pope @entity152 looks at a @entity154 motorcycle in june 2013 pope @entity152 helped raised more than £ 200,000 for charity yesterday by selling his signed @entity154			0
the head of the @entity7 does n't get much time to cruise around the streets of @entity160 on the @entity162 bike			1
so he decided to auction it off and donate the funds to @entity165 , a charity which supports those in need around the world			0
the 1,585cc @entity154 went under the hammer yesterday ( @entity170 ) at @entity173 ' @entity172 auction with an estimate of just £ 10,000			0
but the prospect of owning a bike belonging to the @entity152 became too much for many , sending bidding through the roof			0
potential buyers in the room , on the phone and online battled it out for the bike , with offers soon crossing the 100,000 euro ( £ 83,000 ) mark			0
bids continued to come with an online customer winning the auction , paying a staggering 210,000 euros ( £ 175,000 )			0
premiums took the final price to £ 200,976			0
next up came the @entity152 's biker jacket , which sold for a staggering £ 47,851 - bringing his charity sales to almost £ 250,000			0
the staggering sale had similarities to when a @entity196 casino owner paid £ 127,000 for @entity199 @entity198 's @entity197 in 2005 .			2
