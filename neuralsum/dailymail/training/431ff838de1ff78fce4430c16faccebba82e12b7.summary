by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor cash - strapped families should not waste their money on organic food because they think it is healthier , the government has warned			1
shoppers should instead spend their money on whatever they can afford , even if it means eating tinned or frozen vegetables which are in no way ‘ nutritionally inferior ’			1
the government now faces calls to end £ 20million of subsidies to organic farming , which owes ‘ more to myth than evidence ’			1
critics want the government to end its £ 20million funding for the organic industry , arguing it does nothing to improve the health of the nation a recent study in the @entity24 found organic crops have up to 60 per cent more antioxidants than non-organic crops			1
but critics claim there is still no evidence that organic is a healthier option			2
amid growing concern that too few people are eating enough fruit and vegetables , the government is at pains to stress that families feeling the pinch should not waste their money on organic			1
government frontbencher @entity41 said : ‘ it can be difficult balancing a family budget , but in providing a varied , balanced diet nobody need feel they have given their family a nutritionally inferior diet by choosing lower - priced , conventional products			1
’ just 30 per cent of people meet the recommendation to eat five or more portions of fruit and vegetables a day			2
among the lowest income groups , just 24 per cent of adults manage their five - a - day			0
@entity41 added : ‘ all fruit and vegetables count toward this , whether fresh or frozen , dried or canned , organic or not			1
‘ there is no evidence to suggest that there is a nutritional premium in some forms above others			2
‘ frozen vegetables , for example , are as valuable as fresh in meeting our ' five a day '			0
’ the government encourages mothers who receive @entity70 vouchers for fruit and vegetables ‘ to get the best value for their vouchers , but we would not expect them to prioritise organic products ’			1
she added : ‘ organic products provide a useful extension of consumer choice , but it is worth emphasising that , nutritionally , they are no better and no worse than conventional products			1
’ she said the only benefits of organic farming were enjoyed by ‘ birds , insects , mammals , plants and fungi ’			1
‘ it is up to the consumer to decide how they spend their money on their fruit and veg			1
there are many reasons why an individual might wish to choose organic products but nutritional benefit should not be one of them			0
’ the comments came in a debate in the @entity107 , in which @entity109 peer @entity108 tore into supporters of the organic movement which ‘ owed more to myth than evidence ’			1
he said early enthusiasts included @entity119 ‘ had crazy ideas such as planting according to phases of the moon ’ and even @entity121 ‘ was completely sold on organic farming ’			1
government frontbencher @entity41 said there were many reasons why people might buy organic , but ' nutritional benefit should not be one of them '			2
@entity109 lord @entity108 said organic has become a ' kind of religion that is impervious to scientific evidence ' lord @entity108 added : ‘ for some , the organic movement is still a kind of religion that is impervious to scientific evidence			1
’ claims that it is free of pesticides ignore the fact that levels in non-organic food make little difference to health , he said			0
‘ one cup of coffee contains more carcinogens than you would ingest from a whole year ’s consumption of pesticide residues in fruit and vegetables			0
of course , that should not stop you drinking coffee			0
’ he called for @entity154 to make an important change of policy			2
‘ it should stop spending more than £ 20 million a year on subsidising farmers to change to organic farming			2
’ the money should instead be spent on plant science research , he said			0
@entity164 peer @entity162 said : ‘ study after study has failed to find a significant benefit from organic foods			0
this latest study , although admirably diligent and a perfectly respectable meta - analysis , is no exception			0
’ ‘ the health benefits of organic food , if they exist at all , are immeasurably small			2
‘ the science is therefore becoming very clear that many people who buy organic food because they think it is healthier for them must be wasting their money			0
it would be good if they were informed of that			0
’ however , the @entity182 said the study in the @entity24 showed their were benefits to eating organic			0
chief executive @entity185 said : ‘ we know that people choose organic food because they believe it is better for them , as well as for wildlife , animal welfare and the environment , and this research backs up what people think about organic food			0
' in other countries there has long been much higher levels of support and acceptance of the benefits of organic food and farming : we hope these findings will bring the @entity206 in line with the rest of @entity209 , when it comes to both attitudes to organic food and support for organic farming			0

*struggling* shoppers told they are better off buying more fruit and veg
government says conventional crops are in no way ' nutritionally inferior '
calls for @entity154 to end £ 20million in subsidies to organic industry
