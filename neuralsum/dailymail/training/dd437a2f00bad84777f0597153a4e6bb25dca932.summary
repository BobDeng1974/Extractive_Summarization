@entity4 's longest - serving postwar chancellor said that he would have lost any popular vote on the euro by ' an overwhelming majority '			1

@entity31 , for the first time , has no more war , ' he went on			0
what he did not address in his interview were the lies he and his ministers told to get the common currency in place across @entity31 - a decision now seen to have fatal consequences as the continent thrashes around in the sixth year of a financial crisis without end			2
