@entity0 is plotting to smuggle militants into @entity2 disguised as refugees so that they can launch devastating terror attacks , according to @entity6 intelligence sources			1
encrypted communications unravelled by @entity6 military intelligence have revealed that @entity10 leaders are planning to take advantage of the ' chaotic conditions ' on the @entity15 - @entity14 crossing			1
relaxed border controls would allow is militants to blend in with the thousands of genuine refugees spilling over the border in search of safety , reports @entity22			2
hundreds of @entity24 refugees cross the @entity15 - @entity14 border every day as they flee to safety - now @entity0 plans to disguise its militants as refugees in the hope that they can eventually infiltrate @entity2 the @entity31 tactic would see fighters equipped with fake passports , leaving them free to travel around @entity36 countries and plot terrorist attacks unchecked			1
a @entity6 intelligence source , speaking to @entity39 newspaper @entity38 , said that @entity0 was moving away from plans to conduct aircraft hijackings for fear of tight security - and that they were looking to land a new strategy			0
' in view of the chaotic conditions on the @entity15 - @entity14 border , it is nearly impossible to catch @entity0 terrorists in the wave of refugees , ' wrote @entity38			1
because hundreds of refugees cross the @entity15 - @entity14 border every day , the jihadists have a good chance of remaining unnoticed in the crowds			1
@entity24 refugees seen fleeing the city of @entity59 , just six miles away from the @entity14 border @entity14 is also used by jihadists who want to join @entity0 in @entity15 , as they do not require a visa to get there			1
they go on vacations as tourists and upon arrival have almost no trouble finding a way to cross the border			0
the discovery by @entity6 intelligence comes as the @entity15 border city of @entity59 continues to to bear the brunt of an @entity0 offensive			2
militants raised their flag over a building in the outskirts of the town this morning following an assault lasting almost three weeks , amid fears the town could fall to the jihadists within hours			0
a black flag belonging to @entity0 was visible from across the @entity14 border atop a four - storey building close to the scene of some of the most intense clashes in recent days			1
despite the symbolic raising of the flag , the town 's brave @entity24 defenders said the terrorists had not reached @entity93 and would not be allowed to do so ' for as long as we live '			0
a photograph taken from inside @entity14 shows an @entity0 flag on the hill overlooking the town of @entity59 - also known as @entity59 - this morning			2
just visible beyond the @entity14 tank ( right ) is a small barbed wire fence			0
the fence marks the extent of the @entity14 - @entity15 border in the area @entity0 militants wave their black flag on a hill on the outskirts of @entity59			1
another flag was later seen raised over a four - storey building inside the @entity24 city local sources inside @entity59 confirmed the group had planted its flag but said that @entity24 forces had repelled their advances so far			0
at least 20 @entity0 militants have so far been killed in their assault on the city today - following the deaths of more than 45 fighters on each side yesterday			1
@entity59 is a town of key strategic importance to both @entity0 and the @entity24 resistance due to its close proximity to the largely porous @entity14 border			1
while the city centre is roughly six miles from the barbed wire fence that separates @entity14 from @entity15 , the city 's northern suburbs are so close to @entity14 that civilians in the @entity14 town of @entity134 have been able to watch the fighting with binoculars			2
this morning @entity24 fighters inside @entity59 - which is also known as @entity59 and situated right on the @entity14 border - declared that @entity6 - led airstrikes against @entity0 targets in northern @entity15 have had little impact on the militant group , who have continued to seize swathes of territory on the @entity14 side of the border at least 14 @entity14 army tanks took up positions on a hilltop near @entity59 since the @entity0 offensive on the areas surrounding @entity59 began , approximately 160,000 civilians - mainly @entity151 - have fled across the border into @entity14			1
there are fears @entity0 will embark on another mass slaughter - as it did with the @entity157 in the @entity159 town of @entity160 - if it captures @entity59			2
despite the mass exodus into @entity14 territory , 100,000 people remain in the city			0
@entity166 , head of the @entity167 , said : ' if they enter , it will be a graveyard for us and for them			0
we either win or die			0
we will resist to the end			0
' on the @entity14 side of the border , at least 14 @entity14 army tanks took up defensive positions on a hilltop near @entity59			0
heavy bombardment could be heard down below as plumes of smoke rose from the town .			0

@entity0 militants plan to enter @entity14 disguised as refugees fleeing the fighting
hundreds of @entity157 cross the ' chaotic ' @entity15 - @entity14 border every day
and it would be almost impossible to spot militants blending in with crowds
from there they plan to travel through @entity2 equipped with fake passports
new @entity31 tactic could *unleash* a wave of terror attacks on continent
