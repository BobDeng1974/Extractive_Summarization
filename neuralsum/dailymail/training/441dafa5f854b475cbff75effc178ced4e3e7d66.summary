by @entity0 published : 09:46 est , 28 may 2012 updated : 19:10 est , 28 may 2012 @entity1 is the whiplash capital of @entity3 with one in every 50 residents making compensation claims			1
figures from the @entity7 show huge regional variations in case rates – clear evidence of fraud in the eyes of industry experts			0
whiplash claims cost insurers £ 2billion a year , with bogus payouts adding £ 90 to the typical car insurance premium			1
whiplash : bogus claims cost the insurance industry £ 2 ¿ billion a year and have raised the annual insurance premium for every motorist by £ 90 in the 12 months to march , the number of cases in @entity1 was 22 per thousand residents			1
@entity26 in @entity27 and @entity28 were close behind with 21 and 20 per thousand			0
those figures are twice the national average of nine per thousand and 20 times the level seen in some areas			0
the lowest rates were in @entity34 , where there are strict controls on referral fees paid to garages and insurance brokers in such cases			0
a survey of @entity42 last year showed that 25 per cent of the 550,000 annual claims are ‘ fake or over-diagnosed ’			2
at least 30,000 – 6 per cent – are outright fraudulent , according to the @entity45 insurers receive 1,200 whiplash claims a day , twice the level in other @entity49 countries			1
@entity50 , of the @entity51 , said : ‘ this is the first time there has been a regional breakdown of where whiplash claims are being made			1
‘ and there appears to be a striking correlation between whiplash victims and the number of lawyers specialising in personal injuries claims			2
‘ whiplash claims have gone up by a third in the past three years while the number of accidents has gone down			1
‘ either we have developed the weakest necks in @entity49 or drivers are regarding whiplash injury claims as easy money waiting to be collected			1
’ @entity71 has called for a radical overhaul of the system , saying the compensation culture encourages bogus claims			1
@entity76 , claims director for the insurer , said : ‘ we operate in a legal system that encourages claimants to “ have a go ” – there is no financial risk for even the most minor whiplash claim to be brought			2
' however , this “ whip - cash ” is not free			0
it is not coincidence that premiums have increased as whiplash claims have skyrocketed over recent years			1
‘ the @entity3 needs urgent reform of the system so genuine claimants get the compensation and help they deserve , but minor incidents that hardly give rise to an injury are not penalising motorists through inflated premiums			2
crackdown : the nationwide issue was brought to light by justice secretary @entity101 who has held a ' @entity102 ' in @entity103 in a bid to crack down on the crooks ‘ the @entity106 needs to increase the small claims limit to £ 5,000 , meaning that minor whiplash claims would not need to involve lawyers			1
we also believe that the damages paid for whiplash injuries need to be reduced and capped			0
’ but @entity115 , of personal injury specialist @entity113 , said : ‘ there are some cases that are spurious and fraudulent and every professional legal firm wants to put a stop to that			0
‘ but you have got to make sure that people who are injured are properly compensated			0
’ last night a @entity125 spokesman said : ‘ car insurance costs are simply too high , they must be reduced			0
‘ the government has already taken tough action to ban referral fees , reform no win no fee rules and crack down on fraudulent whiplash claims			2
‘ but we must go further and by working together with drivers and the industry the government is determined to bring some common sense back and get premiums down			0
’ whiplash is caused when the head moves suddenly , damaging ligaments and tendons in the neck – a common injury in a car accident			2
however it is difficult to diagnose and doctors must rely on the patient ’s description of their symptoms .			0
