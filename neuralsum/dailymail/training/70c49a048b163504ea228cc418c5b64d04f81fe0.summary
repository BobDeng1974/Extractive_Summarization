@entity1 internet firms have been warned by the @entity3 government they are not above the law after a damning report into the murder of fusilier @entity7			0
ministers have ordered web firms they must take a ‘ zero tolerance ’ approach to terrorist activity on their networks			0
it comes after the @entity15 found @entity16 ' would have been able to prevent ' the brutal murder of @entity18 if @entity19 had alerted authorities to online murder threats made by one of the killers			1
@entity24 , left , and @entity25 , right , were jailed for life for the murder of @entity7 last year it was found that @entity24 ' expressed his intent to murder a soldier in the most graphic and emotive manner ' five months before last year 's attack - but the warning was not passed on to @entity3 authorities			1
@entity35 , 25 , was run over and then butchered by @entity24 and @entity25 outside @entity37 barracks in south - east @entity38 in the first terror attack on @entity3 soil since the july 7 suicide bombings in 2005			1
in the most explosive section of the @entity15 report , published in november , it stated : ' had @entity16 had access to this exchange at the time , @entity24 would have become a top priority			1
there is then a significant possibility that @entity16 would have been able to prevent the attack			2
' the report raised wider concerns that intelligence agencies faced ‘ considerable difficulty ’ in accessing the content of online communications from @entity1 - based firms including @entity59 , @entity19 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63			1
in the official government response , released today , ministers make clear that internet firms which operate in the @entity3 must abide by @entity3 law			0
drummer @entity7 was almost decapitated in a brutal attack outside @entity37 barracks in may 2013 @entity1 social media giant @entity19 allegedly failed to close down @entity24 's personal account - even after he used it to post explicit threats to kill a soldier			1
today 's report said : ' they left the one that said … “ let ’s kill a soldier ”			1
that did n’t meet their criteria [ for closure ]			0
' while mps and peers refused to name the company in question , it was later reported to be @entity19			0
the report criticised internet companies for their refusal to cooperate with security services to help stop terror attacks			0
it said it was ' clear ' that social media companies could have ' made a difference ' if they alerted @entity3 authorities to online messages in which @entity24 threatened to kill a soldier			1
the report says the company which hosted the terror exchange ' does not regard themselves as under any obligation to ensure that they identify such threats , or to report them to the authorities '			0
it added : ' we find this unacceptable : however unintentionally , they are providing a safe haven for terrorists			0
none of the major @entity1 companies the committee approached proactively monitor and review suspicious content on their systems , largely relying on users to notify them of offensive or suspicious content			2
none of them regard themselves as compelled to comply with @entity3 warrants obtained under the @entity125			0
that means that even if @entity16 had a warrant for the information before the attack , the company might not have responded			1
ministers said : ‘ the fact that a suspect is using a foreign , internet - based communications service as opposed to a @entity3 - based equivalent should make no difference to our ability to access that suspect ’s communications , if that company supplies a service to the @entity3			1
’ it warned of ‘ obstacles ’ which make it difficult for police and spies to obtain the data they need to ‘ investigate and prevent terrorist acts ’			2
social media sites and other so - called @entity150 have now been told to take ‘ stronger , faster and further action to combat the use of their services by terrorists , criminals and their supporters , including through a zero tolerance approach to terrorist activity on their networks ’			2
the government added : ‘ they are committed to measures that make it easier for their users and the authorities to report terrorist and extremist propaganda			0
‘ we will build on this to encourage companies to work together to produce industry standards for the identification , removal and referral of terrorist activity			0
’ in november 's report , the @entity15 criticised the security services for ' delays ' in their investigations which at times was ' inadequate			2
' it conceded that given what the agencies knew at the time ' they were not in a position to prevent the murder of @entity18 '			0
however it slammed giant internet firms for failing to hand over key pieces of information which might have helped security chiefs stop the attacks			2
it says @entity24 's detailed threat to kill a soldier , posted online in december 2012 , was ' highly significant '			1
in the most explosive section of the report , it states : ' had @entity16 had access to this exchange at the time , @entity24 would have become a top priority			1
there is then a significant possibility that @entity16 would have been able to prevent the attack			2
' the main findings of the report included : when the report was released @entity19 released a statement insisting it did not allow extremists to plan attacks on its site			0
a spokesman said : ‘ like everyone else , we were horrified by the vicious murder of fusilier @entity7			0
‘ we do n’t comment on individual cases but @entity19 ’s policies are clear , we do not allow terrorist content on the site and take steps to prevent people from using our service for these purposes			1
’ @entity25 and @entity24 ran down @entity18 , who was dressed in a @entity230 hoodie , in a @entity231 near @entity232 , in south - east @entity38 , before savagely attacking the defenceless soldier as he lay in the road			1
as armed police arrived , the two men charged the vehicle , with @entity24 brandishing a rusted , unloaded revolver			0
they were both shot at the scene			0
the killers were convicted of murder at the @entity242 in december last year and were later sentenced to whole life and life with a minimum of 45 years respectively			0
the @entity15 report confirms both men were known to @entity16 – especially @entity25 , 29 , who was arrested in @entity248 in 2010 attempting to cross the border into @entity250 to fight for the @entity252 terror group @entity251			1
he was passed to @entity3 spies			0
@entity24 was encouraged to murder a @entity3 soldier by an online accomplice referred to only as ‘ foxtrot ’ in today ’s report			1
foxtrot was not known to @entity16 at the time of the killing , but it now thought to be an extremist with links to @entity263			1
in december 2012 @entity24 revealed to foxtrot his desire to murder a soldier ‘ in the most graphic and emotive manner ’ because of @entity3 military action in @entity267 and @entity268			1
@entity24 had not , at that point , five months before the attack , developed a definite plan as to how he might carry out such an attack			2
foxtrot ‘ encouraged him and suggested several potential attack methodologies ’ , the report reveals			0
these ranged from ‘ a martyrdom operation to use of a knife ’			0
‘ @entity24 believed that security arrangements that guarded soldiers ’ places of work might make it difficult to carry out an attack , and that alternative , less secure locations should be considered			1
‘ foxtrot wanted to be kept informed of @entity24 ’s ideas			2
however , no evidence of further contact between them has been found			0
’ the exchange only came to light on june 6 , 2013 , when a @entity1 internet company handed over the information			1
it can not be published on national security grounds .			2

@entity35 was murdered by @entity25 and @entity24
both men were known to @entity16 but spies ruled they were not a major threat
@entity24 posted threat to kill a soldier on internet five months earlier
but @entity19 allegedly failed to raise alarm over extremist posts
intelligence committee said information may have prevented attack
@entity16 delayed submitting an **application** to monitor @entity24 before he struck in may last year ;
without the delay @entity16 would ' probably ' have set up **surveillance** on @entity24 in ' the days before the attack ’ ;
the **application** was sitting on the home *secretary* @entity325 ’s desk at the time of the killing - having only been handed in the day before ;
@entity16 were trailing @entity24 's accomplice @entity25 from december 2012 to april 2013 ;
however , *undercover* agents did not discover anything of ‘ national security concern ’ ;
this meant that @entity16 had to cancel their **surveillance** of @entity336 in april 2013 – just weeks before the attack .
