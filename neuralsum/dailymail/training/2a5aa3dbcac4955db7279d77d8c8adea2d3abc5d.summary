the pair exchanged numbers , and after the woman was made homeless @entity2 offered to take her to ' a nice new home ' in @entity3			1
in reality the pair spent several days sleeping in @entity2 's car and moving between his friends ' flats before he moved her to a rented apartment			2
during this time @entity2 took away her credit cards and mobile phone , effectively making her a prisoner , while forcing her to have sex with him every day			1

i ca n't smile or go anywhere like i could before			0
' the jury convicted @entity2 after just 90 minutes of deliberations following his trial			2

@entity15 ( pictured ) heard that @entity2 had groomed the student while she worked in a sandwich shop in @entity25			1
when she became homeless he offered her a place to stay before making her a prisoner ' you seized this opportunity and lied to her and pretended you had found her a home owned by a friend			1
instead of that you brought her against her will to @entity3 and when she realised you were leaving @entity25 you frightened her and told her you would abandon her			1
' this was a young lady who was virtually alone in a big foreign country			0
you wickedly exploited that vulnerability			0
you forced her into having sex against her will and when she refused you struck her and threatened her			2
' you used her as a sexual resource and you controlled her and isolated her by restricting the use of her phone and locking her in			0
' you took her bank card so you had control of her finances , such as they were , and you repeatedly raped her on an almost daily basis using no contraception			0
' you treated her like a slave and went off to work , taking the only key			0
she was a prisoner and had no life at all as you made her cook and clean for you			0
' you humiliated her by rejecting the food she cooked while you satisfied your sexual appetite			0
' eventually when you had gambled away any money that you had , you offered her to a friend for sexual purposes but you then threatened to turn her into a prostitute for funds to feed your gambling addiction			0
your threats to turn her into a prostitute finally caused her to find the courage to escape			0
' detective constable @entity145 , of @entity146 at @entity147 , said : ' @entity2 befriended his victim when she was vulnerable , but then went on to repeatedly rape and assault her			1
' this must have been a harrowing ordeal for her and we would like to thank her for the courage she has shown in coming forward and reporting @entity2 's crimes			0
' we hope the sentence which has been passed down on him today will be of some comfort to her and will help to give her some closure			0
' we also hope it will encourage other victims of sexual abuse to speak to our specially - trained officers , who will investigate all reports , no matter how historic , sensitively and thoroughly with the aim of securing a conviction against offenders			0
