by @entity0 this swallow ' choir ' pictured during feeding time certainly look as if they 're singing for their supper			1
lined up on an old barn door in @entity5 , wildlife photographer @entity3 captured the chicks bursting into life as their mum returned with food			1
it took mr @entity3 three hours before he managed to photograph the great summer scene , but he said he left knowing he had some great shots and ' memories to cherish forever '			1
the quartet of chicks realised the birds in the centre of the group were more likely to get fed first by their mother , so they edged closer and closer together the moment the ' choir ' of swallow chicks burst into song as the moment their mother returned with food was captured on camera by the patient photographer the group of swallows look rather grumpy as they sit patiently waiting for their mother to bring them their food the group appeared on the old barn door entrance in @entity5 three hours after @entity3 arrived to try and photographed them as they fed mr @entity3 , 35 , from @entity35 first saw the delightful birds as he drove home through the village			1
he said : ' i spotted these whilst driving home from work one day through @entity42			2
' they were all lined up on an old barn door entrance that was blocked up with a fence panel to keep trespassers out			1
but these little intruders must have been reared in the barn and were now able to fly down on to the doorway to be fed by mum			2
' at the time i never had my camera and knowing they would soon be fledging i went back the next day and after an early 6am start the birds appeared after three hours of waiting			1
' they would line up at first slightly apart , then would realise that mum kept feeding the birds located in the middle of the doorway			0
slowly but surely they would shuffle tight together in the hope that mum would pick them when she flew in with some insects and flies			0
mr @entity3 said the chicks had him in ' hysterics ' as they all sat silently waiting for their mother to return before bursting into life when she arrived despite the 6am start and long wait for the birds to appear at the doorway , mr @entity3 said he left the site a ' happy man ' knowing he had taken some remarkable photographs ' they looked so cute and very alert to all the small flies going past the doorway and mother flying past regularly			1
' their little heads were bobbing around like puppets on string waiting for a meal			2
' they had me in hysterics as they would sit patiently all relaxed with their mouths shut			0
' as mum approached they all went crazy			0
it was like they were all shouting " me , me "			0
' ' they flapped their wings and stood up on their legs screaming with their beaks wide open hoping for mum to pop some grub in			0
' the father - of - three said there were dfficult shots to get as the doorway was shaded and the light was bad			2
' on top of that , mum would be in and out with food in less than a second			0
i was shooting 12 frames per second on my camera to stand any chance of such images			0
' in the end i left a happy man knowing i had captured some great shots and memories to cherish forever			1
