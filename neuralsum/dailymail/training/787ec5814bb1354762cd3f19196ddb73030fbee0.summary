it is a mystery that has puzzled biologists - including @entity2 - for 320 years			1
biologists had been unable to work out how the @entity4 wolf came to be the only land - based mammal on the isolated islands , which are 460km from the nearest land , @entity9			2
previous theories have suggested the wolf somehow rafted on ice or vegetation , crossed via a now - submerged land bridge or was even semi-domesticated and transported by early @entity16 humans			1

researchers have now solved the mystery of how the wolf gor to the @entity23 - and say it skated across a frozen sea the @entity18 ( @entity18 ) , is also known as the warrah and occasionally as the @entity4 dog			1
it was the only native land mammal of the @entity4 until it became extinct in 1876 , making it the first known canid to have gone extinct in historical times			2
the first recorded sighting was by captain @entity33 in 1690			1
he took one , but during the voyage back to @entity36 it became frightened by the firing of the ship 's cannon and jumped overboard			0
when @entity2 visited the islands in 1833 he found the species present on both @entity42 and @entity43 , and tame , but numbers were dwindling and he predicted that the animal would join the dodo among the extinct within ' a very few years			1
' islanders hunted it for its fur , and were also concerned it would attack sheep			0
now , @entity52 researchers have found the answer - and say the animals skated across a frozen sea , probably chasing a penguin or seal			1
researchers from the @entity52 ’s @entity58 for @entity59 ( @entity60 ) extracted tiny pieces of tissue from the skull of a specimen collected personally by @entity2			1
the 320 - year - old mystery was first recorded by early @entity67 explorers in 1690 and raised again by @entity2 following his encounter with the famously tame species on his @entity71 voyage in 1834			1
the findings were published in @entity73 today and concluded that , unlike earlier theories , the @entity18 ( @entity18 ) only became isolated about 16,000 years ago around the peak of the last glacial period			0
' the eureka moment was finding evidence of submarine terraces off the coast of @entity9 , ' says study leader professor @entity81			0
' they recorded the dramatically lowered sea levels during the @entity84 ( around 25 - 18,000 years ago )			1
' ' at that time , there was a shallow and narrow ( around 20km ) strait between the islands and the mainland , allowing the @entity4 wolf to cross when the sea was frozen over , probably while pursuing marine prey like seals or penguins			2
' other small mammals like rats were n’t able to cross the ice			0
' the team also used samples from a previously unknown specimen , which was recently re-discovered as a stuffed exhibit in the attic of @entity102 in @entity103			0

the image shows a shallow and narrow ( around 20km ) strait between the islands and the mainland the yellow dots show the areas in @entity9 the relatives of the @entity18 were found , and the red marks its population on the island ' previous studies used ancient dna from museum specimens to suggest that the @entity4 wolf diverged genetically from its closest living relative , the @entity16 maned wolf ( @entity115 ) around seven million years ago , ' said associate professor @entity120 , deputy director of @entity60 and co-lead author with dr @entity122			2
' as a result , they estimated that the wolf colonised the islands about 330,000 years ago by unknown means			0
' critically , however , these early studies had n’t included an extinct relative from the mainland , the fox - like @entity131			2
' we extracted ancient dna from six specimens of @entity136 collected across @entity9 and @entity137 , and made comparisons with a wide group of extinct and living species in the same family			0
' @entity60 ’s analyses showed that @entity144 avus was the closest relative of the @entity4 wolf and they separated only 16,000 years ago – but the question of how the island colonisation came about remained			0

*experts* were baffled by how the now extinct animal crossed the sea
mystery was first recorded in 1690 - and raised again by @entity2
researchers analysed @entity59 from famously tame animal found by @entity2
