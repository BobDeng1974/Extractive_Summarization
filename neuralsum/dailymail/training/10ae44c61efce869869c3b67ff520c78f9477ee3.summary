in this window , i have had an agent threaten me and threaten one of our @entity5 players with physical violence , because he thought he was being cut out of a deal			1
i heard of three or four agents trying to jump in on other deals			1
some of these people are like scavengers			0
it was all deeply unpleasant and i ’m glad it ’s over			1
now we can get on with the @entity16 was right : it feels like gang warfare out there and i can see it spilling over into violence in the future , unless there is legislation from the @entity25 to curb the practices			1
manic times : @entity28 has been working overtime during the transfer window people do desperate things when they are desperate			1
we read of people robbing betting shops or post offices with sawn - off shotguns for £ 5,000			1
we are talking millions of pounds here around a transfer and not enough deals to go around			1
there are too many agents and not enough transfers to feed them			1
agents who would once demand £ 50,000 for their part in a transfer , now want £ 500,000 to £ 1million to either bring a player or keep a player			1
it is quite outrageous and the @entity25 should cap the amount paid to agents for their work			1
i heard of one agent , who took over representation of a player for one day , and he wanted to be paid between £ 1.25m and £ 1.5m for his part in negotiating a new contract			2
making his point : @entity61 likened agents ' behaviour to ' gang warfare ' @entity61 described how agents are wrecking the transfer window earlier in the week here if a player damages his cruciate ligament , or is playing badly , he will expect the club to honour his contract			1
if a player has six good games , it seems he and his agent rush to demand double his salary			2
it has become crazy and a transfer window serves only to provoke the dark forces within the game			1
you will have an agent who thinks he represents a player and then another who hears there may be a deal and tries to break in on the transaction			0
they see it as their survival money			0
as a chairman , you can end up dealing with three or four agents for the same player			1
there are a few agents who are very good at what they do ( and are millionaires as a result of that ) , but others who want to force their way in			2
and do whatever it takes			0
thinking about it , ‘ deeply unpleasant ’ is the best you can say			0
i greatly admire what @entity107 has done at @entity109			1
i take my hat off to him			0
his player , @entity112 , drove down to @entity114 and was actively trying to force a transfer , but mr @entity107 refused to cave in			1
he would not be bullied			0
chaos : @entity112 drove himself to @entity114 before his switch from @entity109 collapsed for the size of that club at @entity109 , they have a fantastic team			1
they have done unbelievably well and i have always respected him - now my admiration has doubled			2
you can not give in to players like this			2
it is the same as giving in to terrorists or kidnappers			1
if you pay the ransom , they will only come back for more			1
consequently , mr @entity107 has done a great service to football			0
it has been hard work in this window			2
i ’ve had sleepless nights			0
i could n’t got to an @entity144 match because i could n’t risk leaving my home phone			0
i ’ve had hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of calls			2
we signed four players ( @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity153 ) but i ’m not satisfied			1
we desperately needed a left back and we did n’t get one			0
however , i 'm confident we have a strong enough team to have a successful run - in and to finish the season strongly			2
for all the deals you have read about , there were 30 others we were trying			0
i thought we had @entity162 from @entity163 and he said he was signing			0
wanted men : @entity5 made attempts to bring in @entity162 ( left ) and @entity166 our contract offer was for six months with an extension based on appearances and he accepted that			1
then he changed his mind and signed for a @entity174 team in the north ( @entity176 )			0
we had a deal for the @entity178 left back , but when @entity162 said yes , we scrapped that			0
then , when we tried to get the other deal back on , the chap had gone somewhere else			0
we then spoke to @entity182 left back @entity183 , who 's on loan in @entity185 and tried to make that happen , but he went to @entity187			2
we tried to bring in goalkeeper @entity166 from @entity188 , but he had an injury and has n’t played often and we had a bit of doubt			0
honestly , it makes you feel ill. i ’m glad it ’s over			1
if any of our fans think we are not spending enough , can i remind you that @entity5 are £ 100m in debt			1
we owe £ 6m in connection with @entity199 - to be paid by july			1
we have various other debt repayments in august totalling £ 20m			2
myself and co-owner @entity201 are giving away our savings			2
there is only so much we can do			0
we are ambitious and we want to bring success to @entity5			1
we are doing our best			0
if you look at what @entity114 have done , possibly putting the future of the club at risk , we can not take that gamble			0
tall order : @entity212 ( right ) trains with @entity114 for the first time on friday morning they are paying wages nobody else outside the big four or five will pay , but it means they have only one player with any sell - on value			1
and that is the goalkeeper , who is quite brilliant - @entity221 , who is 33			2
and came on a free transfer ! let me explain : if you have a player earning £ 30,000 - a - week , then other clubs can afford to buy him			1
once you have a player earning £ 60,000 - a - week plus , only the big four can afford to pay his wages and any transfer fee			1
i admire the balls of the chairman and the owners at @entity114			0
they have broken the club record in buying @entity212 and if it is right that they had to pay the whole fee to @entity241 up front , plus the investment in his wages , that is a remarkable gamble for a club of their size			2
return : @entity249 is back in the reckoning for @entity5 finally , i am often asked about @entity249 ’s deal			1
it is a season - long loan			2
@entity253 had an option to take him back in january , but he has been injured			0
@entity5 have an agreement with @entity253 to sign him at the end of the season , but we have no agreement with the player			1
it was his desire to come to @entity5 to prove himself to @entity253 and that has n’t changed			1
he has had injuries since he came , but he is back to fitness now and we have 15 games left … we need some goals and some points , so let ’s see			2
his return will give us a lift			0
we need one of our strikers to hit goal form			0
we ’re in the middle of a poor run in a tough division and we play a very good @entity282 team on saturday			0
do you know they have conceded the fewest number of goals away from home in the division ? it ’s nine , less than the champions , less than @entity291 and everyone else			0
they are an impressive club who have worked themselves up from the bottom division to the top half of the @entity297 and into a cup final , without risking their financial future			0
our game against them is a sell - out , the 11th successive sell - out at our ground			0
we are operating our ‘ kids for a quid ’ system for this game ( the next one is the home game with @entity309 ) , where any adult can bring as many children as they like for £ 1 each			0
it creates a family atmosphere			0
we believe in offering affordable football and we need a bigger ground to satisfy demand , but as you know , we are working on that , too .			0

@entity28 lifts the lid on the ' dark arts ' *deployed* by agents and players
@entity5 co-owner reveals he was threatened with violence - and so was one of his players
claims ' scavenger ' agents demand more than £ 1m in fees
exposes culture of greed and calls for action from the @entity25
it 's like dealing with terrorists or kidnappers *...* you ca *n't* pay the ransom
praises @entity109 for *standing* up to @entity112 's *walkout*
' honestly , the transfer window makes you feel ill. i ’m glad it ’s over '
