the names disappeared during @entity17 's government in 1972 , but could be seen across the country again if councils erect signs bearing their names			1
communities minister @entity10 has pledged to bring back historic county names that date back nearly 1,000 years the move is being seen as a symbolic gesture to celebrate @entity25			1
mr @entity10 wants residents and local authorities to start using the historic names as much as possible to remind ourselves of the ' tapestry ' of @entity31			1
as part of the initiative , the government has now set up an online map to allow people to see the layout of the historic counties			2
mr @entity10 said : ' no @entity40 officials or @entity42 bureaucrats can remove people ’s loyalty to the country they were born in			1
' from @entity12 to @entity13 or @entity48 to @entity14 , our local history makes us who we are and do what we do			0
it ’s all part of being @entity31			0
the tapestry of @entity31 ’s counties binds our nation together			0
' lost over time : a map of the historic counties of @entity31 which shows where the abolished ones of @entity12 , @entity14 , @entity13 and @entity48 used to be located how they are now : this image shows the metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties map which came into existence after the reforms under the @entity66 he said the current government has ' binned the arbitrary @entity69 ' and was instead ' championing @entity31 ’s traditional local identities which continue to run deep '			1
he added : ' administrative restructuring by previous governments has sought to suppress and undermine such local identities			0
' today , on @entity25 , we commemorate our patron saint and formally acknowledge the continuing role of our traditional counties in @entity31 ’s public and cultural life			1

the move is being seen as a symbolic gesture to celebrate @entity88 ' they have shaped our identities and our view of ourselves and have remained a constant throughout centuries of change to become a vital part of @entity96 culture , geography and heritage			1
' the counties predate any transient lines drawn for convenience or administration and predate the kingdom itself , rooted in history and cultural identity , so that the ancient counties are of the people not of the state			0
' statutes on administration have respectfully left the ancient counties alone			0
' this pattern of the counties brought down to us through the centuries then is the pattern around which the nation has grown and grown great , and worthy of celebration			0
' @entity14 the @entity118 conquered this county in 1092 and created the baronies of @entity121 and @entity14 , which were then formed into the single county of @entity14 in 1226			2
it formed an administrative county in 1889 under the @entity125 until 1974 , after which it became part of the county of @entity130			2
but there is still the @entity132 or the @entity133 in @entity134 the county ceased as an administrative council in 1965			2
the former area now corresponds too much of @entity138 and parts of @entity140 , @entity141 and @entity142			0
