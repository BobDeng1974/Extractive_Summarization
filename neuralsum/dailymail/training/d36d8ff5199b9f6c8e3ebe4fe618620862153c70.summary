the race to get the first self - driving cars on the road has seen the likes of @entity4 and @entity5 battle it out to develop their most advanced vehicles			0
but a relatively small @entity8 company has now beaten the motor giants to it by unveiling the world ’s first commercially available driverless car			0
@entity8 group , @entity13 , announced this week that its zero - emissions vehicle is now available in the @entity15 it might not have the sleek lines of a @entity4 , or the stylish interior of a @entity21 , but the group ’s @entity23 shuttle could help pave the way for more advanced autonomous vehicles			1
launched at the @entity29 show in @entity30 , it can carry up to eight passengers and costs around $ 250,000 ( £ 152,000 )			1
the electric vehicle , which does n't go faster than 12.5 mph , uses on - board lasers to detect obstacles in its path , rather than @entity37			1

users can summon @entity23 from their smartphones or call it up from their desktop			1
once on board , passengers use a touchscreen to select their destination			2
rather than for regular road use , the car is expected to be used in areas such as airports , university campuses , stadiums and arenas			1
it also does n’t require special infrastructure such as rails so it can work on any kind of site			0
the company claims the car is different because it is ‘ intelligent , self - sufficient and environmentally friendly ’			0

‘ imagine a city without noisy , polluting buses , replaced by environmentally - friendly , robotic shuttle buses that can be summoned by your mobile phone , ’ said @entity86 , chief executive of @entity13			0
‘ @entity23 is completely self - driving , 100 per cent electric , emission - free , safe and simple to use			1
it is the ideal solution for taking pedestrians that “ last mile ” ’			0
the car is currently being used in beta version at the @entity98 in @entity99 and the @entity100 in @entity101			0
‘ the average cost of running a regular shuttle service with driver in the @entity15 is $ 200,000 per year , ’ added mr @entity86			2

the system does n't require special infrastructure such as rails so it can work on any kind of site ‘ with @entity23 , we are able to offer a safe , environmentally friendly solution and reduce the operational costs by 40 to 60 per cent			1
’ with more elaborate plans , electric car company @entity4 is expected to produce a driverless car within the next three years , according to its chief executive , @entity123			2
the move will see @entity4 overtake @entity5 , who four years ago began the race to bring driverless cars on to the road			0
@entity5 ’s programme , however , has been slow to get off the ground because carmakers are worried about potential liabilities from accidents , according to a source speaking to the @entity135 in september			0
@entity4 will produce a driverless car within the next three years , according to its chief executive , @entity123			0
its autonomous car would allow the driver to hand over 90 per cent of the control of the car @entity5 has already fitted out several cars with radar - like equipment that lets them navigate roads in @entity145 and @entity146 the group , however , has already fitted out several cars with radar - like equipment that lets them navigate roads in @entity145 and @entity146			2
@entity123 's three - year timeline is more ambitious than those set out by other car makers , as well as analysts that say it will take 10 to 15 years before self - driving cars become a reality			0
@entity160 's @entity159 and @entity162 's @entity161 have both said they hope to begin selling self - driving cars by the end of the decade .			0
