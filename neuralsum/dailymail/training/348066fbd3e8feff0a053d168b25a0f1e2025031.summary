by @entity0 published : 16:02 est , 8 june 2013 updated : 03:00 est , 9 june 2013 the @entity1 has been criticised for allowing staff to mob the @entity4 and film her on their mobile phones as she toured its revamped hq			1
@entity10 sources said they were struck by ‘ how chaotic ’ friday ’s visit to @entity12 in @entity13 appeared			1
they had been led to believe that staff would remain at their desks and ‘ carry on as normal ’ in a professional manner – but at every turn she was met by a forest of raised smartphones and tablets			1
guided tour : the @entity4 visited the @entity1 to officially open the new £ 1 billion studios in @entity23 , central @entity13 newsflash : presenters @entity25 and @entity26 turn round to find the @entity4 has turned up during one their bulletins caught unawares : the newsreaders appeared a little flustered as their celebrity guest appeared in the background joining in : radio 4 presenters @entity33 ( left ) and @entity34 sit alongside the queen speech : speaking on @entity38 and the @entity39 she said how she had been to the original @entity12 with her parents before the war and then later before her @entity42 , with prince @entity43 happy : the @entity4 looked relaxed as @entity10 said prince @entity43 is ' progressing satisfactorily ' after his operation one observer said staff followed their 87 - year - old visitor around like ‘ zombies ’			1
@entity50 , editor - in - chief of majesty magazine , said : ‘ it is just depressing that these people do n’t know how to behave , it is very rude and offensive			0
‘ the @entity1 should have told their staff there should be absolutely no filming on mobile phones			1
i ’d be livid if i was the @entity4			2
‘ the bits i saw on television looked quite bizarre and completely out of control			0
i think the @entity1 should have given their staff lessons on how to behave before she arrived			1
’ the @entity43 was said to be ‘ progressing satisfactorily ’ yesterday as he continued to recover in hospital from exploratory abdominal surgery on friday			0
@entity43 ’s @entity43 ’s doctor , professor @entity69 , visited him for 30 minutes on his third day at the @entity70			0
the prince , who will be 92 tomorrow , is expected to recuperate at the clinic in @entity73 for two weeks			0
the illness is not thought to involve his heart or bladder – which have caused him problems in the past			0
@entity10 said the surgery had been pre-arranged			2
not so long ago , the only things held aloft during royal visits were flags , modestly flicked from side - to - side , often no higher than the neck			0
in recent years taking snaps and videos on mobile phones has become commonplace , but normally during outdoor walkabouts rather than indoors			2
as princess @entity89 , the @entity4 accompanied her father @entity90 to @entity12 in 1939			2
and during last week ’s visit she recalled in an address that she ‘ came again with the @entity43 shortly before the @entity42 in 1953 ’			0
today ’s @entity1 newsroom – with its casually attired staff and sea of smartphones – would have been a far cry from those days when decorum was paramount			1
‘ i think they should have shown far more respect , ’ said etiquette expert @entity99			0
‘ it must have been very disturbing for the @entity4			2
‘ and , let ’s face it , these people could have still have had photos			0
this was all taking place in the @entity1 , after all			2
the trouble is people want to get their own pictures on @entity111 to show they were there			0
no sooner had the @entity4 departed than staff were plastering their souvenir snaps across social media			1
asked about the criticism , a @entity1 spokesman said the visit ‘ was a significant day for the @entity1 and staff were eager to join in the celebration and give @entity4 a warm welcome ’			1
showstopper : presenters on @entity38 do their best to maintain their cool despite their star guest drawing a crowd : the @entity4 maintained her usual calm as her appearance caused quite a stir at the @entity1 on set : her majesty looking pleased as she walks past the @entity132 during her tour stoic : the queen remained utterly composed , despite not having prince @entity43 by her side queen of the screen : actress @entity139 introduces herself to her majesty in front of a huge mural of @entity142 @entity143 : newsreader @entity144 bows as he shakes her majesty 's hand all smiles : the presenters turned around and laughed when they realised @entity151 's monarch was standing behind them in the studio chat : she spoke to lead singer @entity155 of @entity156 , and they briefly discussed @entity158 , with her majesty saying he should be careful of the mud royal performance : the script played a cover of @entity165 's track ' heroes ' which became a theme song for the @entity167 reflection : only on once occasion did the @entity4 look to have something on her mind as she sat in the @entity1 's @entity172 famous fan : the queen is known to be a fan of classical music but appeared to be listening intently to the script @entity178 to meet you : the @entity4 says hello to sir @entity180 with @entity181 , @entity182 and @entity183 guest of honour : the queen was already six when @entity12 first opened in 1932 royal welcome : @entity187 , chairman of the @entity188 ( centre ) and the @entity1 's new director general @entity190 are ecstatic to meet @entity4 on the red carpet royal arrival : crowds turned out to greet her majesty as she arrived at @entity12 , five minutes away from where prince @entity43 is in hospital pleased to see her : flag - waving crowds turned out to wish her majesty well as she came to visit the @entity1 's £ 1bn home			1

@entity10 describe @entity4 's visit as ' chaotic '
@entity1 staff *accused* of not behaving ' in a professional manner '
hundred of *employees* thrust out camera phones to snap the @entity4
