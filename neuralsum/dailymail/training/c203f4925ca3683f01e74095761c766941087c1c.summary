' it was a horrific sight - something that is still clear in my memory , despite it being almost twenty years ago			0
' there was a note pinned to it which read " you will end up the same way "			0
it was a clear threat , they wanted to scare me but they were not going to put me off my work			0
' @entity20 , who now lives and works in @entity100 , was sent the bloodied lamb ’s carcass at the same time as the @entity103 was visiting @entity41 and had urged people to rebel against the @entity7			1
mobsters had already murdered one campaigning priest @entity107 , 56 , who was gunned down by hit men in the run down @entity110 area of @entity5 in 1993 and the pope praised him for standing up to the gangsters			2

@entity1 ( pictured an artist 's impression ) was arrested in @entity117 after 19 years on the run mobsters had already murdered one campaigning priest @entity107 , 56 , who was gunned down by hit men in the run down @entity110 area of @entity5 in 1993 ' @entity7 then turned its attention on me because i would not back down to them			1
@entity1 back then was a dangerous and powerful boss who controlled the area with fear			1
' my superiors in @entity5 were very scared for my welfare but i said i would not back down - as a result i was given a police escort around the clock for ten years until i left @entity41 in 2006			1
' it was those officers with families looking after me who were brave			0

they wanted me out but i was determined to stay and i did			0
' he added : ' i did n’t know he had been arrested until you told me but i ’m not surprised it has taken so long to track him down			2
these people are very clever			0
' life on the run is horrible			2
you live in fear of being caught , looking over your shoulder all the time , dreading a knock on the door			0
it ’s not a peaceful or serene life - it ’s similar to the life i had under escort for ten years			0
' one thing i will say though is that i have no anger or hatred towards @entity53 or the others that threatened me all those years ago			0
i have forgiven them and i bear no animosity towards them			0
