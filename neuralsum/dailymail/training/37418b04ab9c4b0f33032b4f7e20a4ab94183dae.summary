the @entity33 authorized the release of the review group 's report wednesday , weeks ahead of schedule			0
the president was also conducting an internal review of the government 's surveillance programs and planned to announce his decisions in january			1
the review board 's proposals address the government 's ability to collect intelligence both in the @entity16 and overseas			2
the recommendations include tightening federal law enforcement 's use of so - called national security letters , which give the government sweeping authority to demand financial and phone records without prior court approval in national security cases			1

leaks : the task force was created amid a political firestorm that followed leaks last summer by former @entity13 contractor @entity67 the disclosures triggered outrage among civil libertarians and many members of @entity76 , who considered the degree of data collection an overreach of post- 9/11 anti-terror efforts			2
leaks about surveillance and a secret court that works with the @entity13 put enormous pressure on @entity23 , who came into office promising a more transparent government			1
key members of @entity76 are considering changes to programs under the @entity91 law to restrict @entity13 snooping programs			2
' the message is very clear , ' @entity94 chairman @entity93 said following the report 's release			0
' @entity13 , you 've gone too far , according to @entity99			0
@entity93 mentioned the section in law allowing telephone data collection ' was not essential to preventing attacks , ' according to the report			2
that directly contradicts national security officials , who have said the authority had helped thwart terror plots both in the @entity16 and abroad			1

access to the data would then be permitted only through an order from a @entity129			0
‘ with regard to the bulk metadata of phone calls , we think there should be judicial review before that information is accessed and we do n't think the government should retain it , ’ said @entity130 , a member of the five - person panel			2
if both recommendations were enacted , it 's likely they would slow down the intelligence collection process			0
the panel recommendations do allow for exceptions ‘ in emergencies ’ , leaving open the possibility of intelligence agencies scanning the information quickly and asking for permission later if they suspect imminent attack			0
although the task force did not recommend ending any of the @entity13 's daily sweeps of telephone and @entity158 data , as some critics urged , a senior lawyer for one influential privacy advocate group said the review group 's recommendations would amount to ‘ sweeping ’ changes in government policy if @entity23 accepts them in bulk			1
