by @entity0 a type of medication that is normally used by asthma sufferers has been proving stunningly effective in treating a form or paralysis – and has even allowed a wheelchair - bound teenager to walk unaided for the first time in seven years			1
@entity8 , 18 , took salbutamol to treat congenital myasthenia			1
he had been so disabled he sometimes needed an oxygen - mask to breathe			0
but he says : ‘ within three days i could stand and within a week i could walk			1
’ now he is about to go camping and adds : ‘ i would n’t have contemplated this last year			0
’ remarkable : @entity8 , 18 , took salbutamol to treat congenital myasthenia			1
he claims he could stand up and walk within three days ( file picture ) @entity16 is prescribed to asthmatics in inhaler form under the brand name @entity16			1
it is now proving a remarkable treatment for myasthenia , which affects 12,000 @entity23 and can cause symptoms ranging from a mild drooping of the eyelids to full - blown paralysis			2
the drug is a beta - 2 - agonist , a class of compounds that affect the nerve communications in the muscles			0
it was already known that a similar drug , ephedrine – a stimulant also found in cold and flu remedies , and in higher doses in dangerous ‘ fat - burning ’ diet pills – was sometimes effective in treating myasthenia			2
studies had shown widespread benefits , with another teenage patient going from needing crutches to walk , to jogging and doing sit - ups			2
so professor @entity45 at the @entity46 , of @entity47 , @entity48 , looked for other drugs which may work as well or better			0
one of these was salbutamol			2
@entity50 is either congenital – due to a genetic mutation – or caused by the immune system turning inward and attacking the body , developing later in life			0
so professor @entity45 at the @entity46 , of @entity47 , @entity48 , suggested @entity8 try the drug the congenital condition is noticeable from birth but the problem with treating it is that it is caused by different genetic mutations , which need different drug combinations			1
prof @entity45 explains : ‘ our research is devoted to working out what drugs best treat each one			0
’ @entity16 can be used alone or with other drugs			0
prof @entity45 adds : ‘ it is not yet licensed for use in the condition , but clinicians are happy to prescribe it			0
’ he suggested that @entity8 try salbutamol alongside pyridostigmine , a standard drug which he had been taking since he was four			1
‘ i expected i ’d get stronger , but had no idea i ’d be able to walk again , ’ says @entity8 , from @entity76 , who is awaiting a-level results before hopefully going to study @entity79 at @entity48			1
‘ i still use my wheelchair out and about , but at home i walk around – just getting dressed , washing and cooking , it ’s amazing to be able to normal things			0
’ prof @entity45 says : ‘ it is incredibly rewarding to see results like this			0
over the last couple of years we have seen patients rise from their wheelchairs within months , but @entity8 ’s quite exceptional			1
