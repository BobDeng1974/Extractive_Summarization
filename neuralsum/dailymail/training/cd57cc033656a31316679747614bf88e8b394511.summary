flexing his pecs and admiring his glowing stage tan , @entity0 begins his posing practice			1
he recently competed in his very first bodybuilding show against an impressive line - up of muscular physiques from all over the @entity7			2
but unlike his fellow competitors , @entity0 leaves the house every morning with his school lunch - box and a kiss on the cheek from his mother - because he 's only 14 years old			1
he started training at just 11 years old and as the youngest competitive bodybuilder in the @entity7 , @entity22 lifts weights for an hour every day			1
he also does cardio before school to help keep his body fat below eight per cent			1
and as the youngest member of a super-fit family of four , he enjoys firm support from his biggest fans - his mother and father			1
@entity0 says : ' my dad 's a bodybuilder and he 's always been my inspiration			1
ever since i was a little boy , all i 've wanted to do is step on stage			0
' @entity38 has encouraged me every step of the way - he 's my coach , my gym buddy and my training partner			1
' my sister comes to the gym with us too - she 's a competitive power lifter and has even won gold medals - i 'm really lucky to have such a good support network around me			2
' next year all three of us will all be competing in the same season - mum will help to prep our food and will be there to support us at our shows			1
' the gym is my life - i love lifting and i love the buzz i get when i hit a personal best or see growth in my muscles			1
at the moment , i weigh 73kg , but eventually i want to hit around 90 - 95kg			2
' discliplined : the 14 - year - old , who trains constantly , could easily be mistaken for a bodybuilder twice his age @entity0 competed in the @entity63 show in @entity64 on november 9			1
the competition was his very first , and was a ' test ' to determine whether bodybuilding is the sport he wishes to pursue long - term			2
while some parents may think @entity22 is too young to train as a bodybuilder , his mother @entity71 and father @entity72 believe he has everything it takes to be a star in the sport , and prepare his meals accordingly			2
@entity71 says : ' @entity22 is on a very strict diet to ensure he is the best he can be come competition time			1
' bodybuilding is a very unforgiving sport , and every muscle in @entity0 's body must be developed to demonstrate size , symmetry and condition			1
' he currently eats four meals a day , consisting mainly of lean meat , brown rice , sweet potato and oats			2
' @entity22 snacks on chicken and salad throughout the day at school , and whenever he can he will come home for lunch so he can have a hot meal too			0
' @entity72 ( his father and coach ) gives him one cheat day a week - which means he 's allowed to eat whatever he wants - after all , he is only 14 and still growing , and we have to recognize that			1
breakfast : scrambled eggs and porridge oats mid-morning : roast chicken and salad lunch : chicken , pork , steak or fish with vegetables and brown rice dinner : chicken , pork , steak or fish with salad and sweet potato ' @entity22 's body fat sits at around 10 % which is extremely low for a child of his age , so we have to be careful			1
' it will come down even further for the day of his show , but during the off season it will probably go up to around 12 %			0
' a keen swimmer , bmx rider , and skateboarder , @entity0 enjoys pursuing a wide range of physical activities during his time out from the gym			2
but when he does push iron , there 's no messing around			0
@entity0 says : ' i can bench press more than my own body weight but it 's not all about how much you can lift			1
' bodybuilding is not all about size and strength - it 's an aesthetic sport so you have to train all your muscle groups to complement each other correctly			0
' for example , it 's no good having a huge chest if you have no arms - that 'd just look weird			0
' my favourite muscle groups to train are arms because i tend to see quick progress in those areas , and my worst is back - i need to work on that some more			0
' it can take years and years to build a good physique , and there 's always room for improvement - there is no ' perfect ' body - plus , it 's a very subjective sport and you never know what the judges might be looking for			2
the teenager competed in the @entity63 show in @entity64 on november 9 ' the day before my shows i cut my water right down to dehydrate myself - this helps to bring my muscles to the surface and give me a vascular look			1
' it 's amazing how much you can change your body through making small tweaks like fluid intake			0
' my friends at school are fascinated by my physique because most of them have n't started going to the gym yet			0
' they ask me questions all day long about how to get bigger arms and how to pump up your chest			0
' some of my male teachers laugh and joke about how they 'd love to have a body like mine too			0
' despite having no shortage of admirers , @entity0 insists he 's still too young for love			2
he said : ' i do n't have a girlfriend at the moment , but the time will come			0
at the moment i 'm too focused on my diet and training to think about dating girls			0
' i 'm only 14 - most of my friends do n't have girlfriends yet either			0
family business : @entity0 is pictured with his sister @entity208 , 16 - who is a prize - winning power lifter ' when i do meet someone they will most definitely have to be into fitness , enjoy going to the gym and most importantly - impress my mum and dad			1
' @entity0 's proud mother @entity71 said : ' we are extremely proud of @entity22 for having achieved so much at such a young age			1
' his body is earned , not given , and his hard work and dedication has certainly paid off			0
' both our children are extremely active - his sister @entity208 is a very successful power - lifter - it 's how we encourage them to be			2
' some parents might think @entity0 's regime is radical for a boy of his age , but it 's his choice , he absolutely lives for his training			1
fan club : the bodybuilding schoolboy 's biggest supporters are his parents @entity71 and @entity72 ' he is extremely mature for his age , both physically and mentally			2
' his father @entity72 is particularly looking forward to competing with him at the @entity237 show next spring - they will be a father and son duo			1
' we will always support @entity22 in whatever career or sport he decides to pursue as an adult and ca n't wait to see him up on stage			0
' @entity245 , organizer of the @entity63 event said : ' @entity22 is certainly the youngest competitor we 've seen , and to my knowledge the youngest competitor in the sport to date			0
' he competed against men seven years his senior in his class , which is very ambitious			0
no matter how good your genes may be , it takes years to build an impressive physique			0
' i do n't foresee any health problems with someone of @entity0 's age competing			1
' i 'd encourage more youngsters to take up the sport - it 's certainly better than living on crisps and chocolate like many school kids seem to do nowadays			0
' the great thing about bodybuilding is we get people come to us of all ages and it does n't discriminate against the young or the old			0
' it 's the friendliest , most welcoming sport you could ever take part in			0
