former @entity1 skipper @entity0 believes the increasing @entity3 presence in the @entity4 can bear fruit as @entity7 's men go in search of a first @entity10 title			1
even without the departed @entity12 , soon to be plying his trade in rugby union 's @entity14 with @entity16 , there will be no shortage of inside knowledge when @entity19 take on @entity20 in @entity21 on sunday and @entity22 in @entity23 next saturday			1
@entity12 's twin brothers @entity26 and @entity28 are still with @entity29 , one - time @entity31 favourite @entity30 is a year into his contract with @entity33 , @entity25 - born @entity24 is the man pulling the strings at @entity35 and , of course , @entity0 is fresh from a heroic performance in a losing cause for @entity39 in the @entity40			2
@entity0 believes @entity19 's players will know how to beat @entity20 and @entity22 @entity19 head coach @entity7 will know all about the opposition having coached in @entity20 @entity19 's @entity43 is among the players who currently play in @entity20 even more crucially , @entity7 himself is acutely familiar with the opposition courtesy of his role as assistant coach at @entity49 , which makes a nonsense of criticism from the @entity53 media of supposed ignorance of potential new cap @entity55 on the part of @entity60 second - rower @entity58			1
@entity0 insists @entity19 have all the knowledge they need and that their @entity4 experience can help them reach their first final @entity63			2
' it helps , ' @entity0 said			0
' i know what it 's like to come up against a ( @entity69 ) @entity68 or a ( @entity71 ) @entity70			0
' @entity7 has been in the @entity53 system for 12 months and that definitely helps when it comes to the preparation side of things			0
' we can pass that experience on to the other players			0
' from his close - up experience , @entity0 is convinced @entity19 have what it takes to make a big impact in the tournament			2
' they are great players , do n't get me wrong , but they are human after all and they do make mistakes , ' he added			0
@entity22 's 14 - 12 win over @entity89 on saturday morning means @entity20 will be unable to reach the november 15 final in @entity91 if they lose to @entity7 's men on sunday .			1

@entity0 believes @entity3 players will know how to beat @entity20 and @entity22
@entity19 boss @entity7 is the assistant coach at @entity49
