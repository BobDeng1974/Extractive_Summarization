getting a parking fine is a bad experience at the best of times			2
but getting one you have n't earned - that 's even worse			0
this was the reality for @entity8 woman @entity7 last week , when she paid a visit to her local shopping mall during her work lunch break			0
however , what she did n't realise at the time was that the dashboard camera ( dashcam ) installed in her car would help her case against the parking company that tried to rip her off			1
' to do this sort of thing to unwitting people , i just think it 's criminal , ' she told the program			0
footage from ms @entity7 's dashcam shows her switching off the engine just before 12 o'clock last friday , at which point she put the paid two hour ticket in her car and went about her business			1
the woman returned to an $ 88 fine ( left ) she was n't entitled to , but luckily her dashcam ( right ) had recorded the time she left her car but , the $ 88 fine she received was time - stamped at 12.39 - well before she was due to return around 2pm			1
when she brought this up with an employee at a nearby office , ms @entity7 did n't get the reaction she was hoping for			1
' i went over to the employee who works for the company and i asked her could she explain why i got fined when i had an unexpired ticket			0
' she told me that i had an expired ticket - she could n't care less			0
she just stood there and blatantly lied to me , ' ms @entity7 revealed			2
the ticket was issued just 40 minutes after she left her car , despite her having paid the full far for two hours luckily for her the parking company have since dropped the fine , but the savvy driver expressed her dismay over the fact that other motorists may have been caught out by the same tricks			1
' i 'm just glad that i have the evidence and i 'm really sorry for the people who have been caught and had no evidence , ' she said			0
' ( it 's ) definitely revenue raising , i mean there 's other ways that you could police a carpark , ' ms @entity7 continued .			2

@entity7 got a parking ticket in a two hour *zone* after less than an hour
her dashcam recorded the times she parked and returned to her car
ms @entity7 said the parking company *refused* to listen when she told them
the $ 88 fine has now been *waived* thanks to her video evidence
