@entity0 has apologised a second time for video footage showing him making racist remarks			1
he was forced to make his latest apology after a second video emerged showing @entity0 singing his hit song @entity6 , but changing the final words to ‘ lonely n * * * * * ’			1
the singer , who fans branded ‘ an arrogant little twerp ’ over the footage , also uses sick lyrics about killing black people and joining the @entity14			1
the footage will further jeopardise his career , which has already suffered from a string of run - ins with police in @entity34 and his native @entity35			1
now he has apologised - once again - for the latest controversial footage			1
he told @entity37 : ' facing my mistakes from years ago has been one of the hardest things i 've ever dealt with			0
' but i feel now that i need to take responsibility for those mistakes and not let them linger			0
' at the end of the day , i just need to step up and own what i did			0
' he said in a statement : ‘ i ’m very sorry			0
i take my friendships with people of all cultures very seriously and apologise for offending or hurting anyone with my childish and inexcusable mistake			2
‘ i was a kid then and i am a man now who knows my responsibility to the world and to not make that mistake again			0

racists : the popstar was reportedly caught on camera changing the lyrics of his song @entity6 to sing ' one less lonely n * * * * * ' - and joked about joining white supremacist group the @entity14 ( file picture ) @entity0 , 20 , who has sold more than 15million albums and earned a reported £ 80million , blamed the first video , filmed when he was 15 , on youthful indiscretion			1
in the latest footage @entity0 wears a blue shirt and a dog tag necklace			1
a female friend can be heard laughing in the background , and the singer smiles as he gives his twisted rendition of @entity6 , the original version of which has been viewed 203million times on @entity82			1
the @entity14 was a racist organisation set up in @entity83 in 1866 to resist plans to create racial equality			1
believing in white supremacy , the @entity34 group 's members terrorised leaders , both black and white , who called for greater integration			1
confederate general @entity91 was the first leader , or ' grand wizard ' , and presided over a hierarchy of ' grand dragons ' , ' grand titans ' and ' grand cyclopses '			0
members of the group - which is also known for being @entity99 - wore white costumes with masks and conical hats designed to scare opponents and hide their identities			1
after dying out in the 1870s , the group was reformed around 1915 and took up the sign of the burning cross at rallies			2
partly fuelled by fears over immigration from the @entity113 and @entity115 revolution in @entity116 , the group swelled to its largest ever size of around 4million members in the 1920s			2
despite a slight resurgence during the civil rights struggles of the 1960s , the group has slowly died away and is now thought to have fewer than 5,000 members			2
last night show business website @entity125 reported that the new video was captured when @entity0 was 14 , after he had seen a comedian ’s parody of @entity6			1
the website also claimed @entity0 had realised at the time that making the recording was a mistake , and had told his mentor , the @entity136 star @entity135 , and actor @entity137			1
mr @entity135 rebuked him and showed him videos to illustrate the evils of racial prejudice , it reported			0
what 's more , @entity125 reports that the @entity145 clan , which features the likes of ' @entity147 and @entity148 – who @entity0 regularly hangs out with – are supporting the never say never hitmaker			1
@entity150 , president of @entity145 , is quoted by the website as saying : ' @entity0 does not have a slave mentality			2
he treats his people with respect			0
' fans in @entity156 and the @entity34 – who call themselves ‘ @entity157 ’ – left him in no doubt about their dismay last night			0
one , @entity160 , said : ‘ he needs to go back to school , get an education , receive [ some ] discipline and learn some respect			0
‘ he ’s out of control and it ’s not going to have a happy ending the rate it ’s going			0
’ @entity169 , from @entity170 , wrote : ‘ no i do n’t care , you know there are certain words you should n’t use and that ’s hurtful words against other people			0
sorry @entity0 you ca n’t type a little message on twitter and get out of it ! ’ another online commenter branded the baby - faced singer an ‘ arrogant little twerp ’			1
a user calling themselves disgruntled reader , from @entity190 , said : ‘ the @entity14 is n’t funny , racism is n’t funny and using the n - word is n’t funny			1
people were terrorized , abused and murdered over the colour of their skin at one time , and making a joke of it is nothing short of breathtaking stupidity and arrogance			0
’ @entity200 users in the @entity34 mocked the singer by posting a picture of @entity14 members apparently saying : ‘ we would like to distance ourselves from mr @entity0			1
all organisations have a few embarrassing members			0
’ the white supremacist @entity14 lynched hundreds of black people in the southern @entity34			1
showing him the way : @entity135 took @entity0 aside and showed him some racist videos to help him understand why his behaviour was so terrible turning to @entity212 : as well as his apology , @entity0 posted this @entity216 passage on wednesday , from the book of @entity218 and from @entity219 , both passages relate to forgiveness ' i 'm sorry ' : @entity0 apologised for the earlier video clip this week , saying that when he was a child he did not realise how certain words could hurt , adding that he learned from his mistakes @entity0 shot to fame as a 15 year old in 2009 when his @entity82 songs – recorded in his bedroom – became a global phenomenon			1
since then he has sold more than 15million albums and earned a reported £ 80million			0
but the singer has shed his clean - cut , @entity232 image in favour of tattoos and gangster clothing and has been embroiled in a series of controversies thanks to his increasingly hedonistic lifestyle			2
in january , the singer ’s home in @entity242 was searched by police after he allegedly threw eggs at a neighbour ’s house			0
officers found two jars of cannabis and cocaine and arrested one of his friends			0
the following week , @entity0 himself was arrested for allegedly drag - racing his @entity254 on a public street in @entity256 and being over the drink - drive limit			1
last year he upset thousands of fans in @entity259 by arriving late for a concert , spitting on fans from a balcony and lashing out at a photographer in a street			0
he was also pictured allegedly smoking cannabis at a party , while drugs and a @entity269 handgun were found on his tour bus in @entity271			0
the videos are likely to disappoint the black artists who have worked with @entity0 , including @entity274 and @entity275			1
@entity135 has yet to offer any comments in support of his protegé			0
however , on thursday @entity147 and other members of @entity145 were quick to say they still supported @entity0 and had dismissed his ' mistake '			2
after a string of outrageous antics , @entity0 ’s clean - cut @entity232 image has been replaced by that of a tattooed bad boy who once spat on fans from a balcony			1
he has been charged with assault in @entity290 for allegedly punching a limousine driver in the back of the head while he was driving him and his entourage			0
he has pleaded not guilty to driving under the influence and driving with an expired licence after being caught allegedly drag racing in a yellow @entity254 in @entity297 , @entity298			2
the @entity299 is still investigating him after eggs were thrown at his neighbour ’s home in @entity303 , @entity190			0
when police raided @entity0 ’s mansion they found cocaine left ‘ in plain view ’ and arrested his rapper friend @entity308 for drug possession			2
his actions have provoked such a backlash in the @entity34 that a @entity314 petition calling for the @entity35 to be kicked out of the @entity34 reached more than 180,000 signatures			2
@entity125 last night claimed @entity0 had been approached two months ago by a man who wanted £ 650,000 for the first video , of the racist joke , but his pr team refused			2
the man then supposedly asked for half that sum but @entity0 ’s people refused again , saying they did not think it would do much damage since he was so young .			2
