there are a host of amazing things to see beneath the sea - as young photographer @entity5 's stunning images prove			1
documenting life beneath the waves of the @entity9 , @entity5 's images show the startling variety of life that can be found in the world 's oceans			1
since graduating in @entity15 from the @entity16 in july , @entity5 's ' day job ' has been stalking big cats with renowned photographer @entity18			1
@entity5 said : ' for me the best thing about underwater wildlife photography is the intimacy			1
in the majority of cases when i 'm photographing on land the animals do n't know i 'm there			2
i 'm hidden in a hide , shooting them from a distance with a long telephoto lens			2
' under the water i do n't have the luxury of sitting in a hide and waiting for hours on end for an animal to turn up			2
furthermore , the more water there is between me and my subject the less clear and colour rich the image			0
so to get great images i have to have close - up , in your face encounters with these weird and wonderful creatures			0
photographer @entity5 's trip the the bottom of the @entity9 saw him come across the blue spotted stingray a school of pygmy sweepers swimming around the wreck of the @entity74 , a 95m ship which sank in 1887 after hitting a reef @entity5 decided to indulge his passion for marine wildlife and signed onto a ' liveaboard ' diving trip organised by ' @entity81 ' if you look closely you can make out an anemone fish poking its head out of an anemone while left , an even smaller eel can be seen a diver explores the tile filled cargo hold of the @entity91 wreck during the exhilarating @entity9 dive ' some say that taking a camera down on a dive takes away from the experience			1
you 're so engrossed in flash settings and shutter speeds that you miss things			0
i could n't disagree more			0
' because getting ' the shot ' takes time and experimentation , on a typical dive i might spend time with just two or three subjects , rather than zooming round on a whistle - stop tour			1
' taking a camera down with me and spending a lot of time in one place enables me to spot things i might have otherwise missed			0
' according to @entity5 a classic example of this happened while he was following a lionfish and suddenly spotted a tiny fish poking its head out of a host anemone			1
@entity118 soft coral , a school of glass fish and diver and photographer @entity5 divers surround the stern of the @entity126 , a @entity128 steamship which ran aground in 1869 @entity130 anthias fish swimming amongst the coral gardens of @entity132 banded coral shrimp picking parasites off a giant moray eel were caught in action by stunning camera work by @entity5 a devil scorpionfish lies in wait for prey on the deck of the @entity142 , the most famous wreck in the @entity9 he added : ' i had the wrong lens on to really get the best out of the opportunity , but even so i put my little finger in the shot to give a sense of scale			1
it was only after 2 or 3 shots that i then noticed the equally tiny eel , posing in its hole just to the left of the anemone '			0
meanwhile , his decision to hang around and watch a stationary octopus paid off when it began to hunt			2
' my patience paid off as it soon began to hunt : instead of swimming , it crawled across the coral purposefully using its eight muscular tentacles			2
' fish were fleeing in all directions but some foolishly chose not to run but instead , hide in little crevices			0
the octopus then stabbed its tentacles into every escape hole in the rock before expanding the membrane between its arms forming a huge balloon			0
' once cornered like this , the fish 's fate was sealed , quite literally , sucked into the octopus ' beak in the centre of its arms			0

@entity5 took on the dive after graduating recently in *zoology* from @entity16
the young photographer is more used to snapping big cats than underwater environments
stunning set of marine photographs include octopuses on the hunt and diving around ancient wrecks
