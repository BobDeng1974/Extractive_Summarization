just as i ca n't travel to @entity1 without thinking of @entity2 , so i ca n't travel to @entity3 without thinking of @entity4			1
their songs of beaches , baggies , boards and bikinis painted a picture of a sun - kissed paradise , and their voices sounded as bright and as laid - back as @entity14 itself			1
this time i was travelling specifically to discover the people and places that inspired the band			1
i started in @entity21 where the three @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 - were raised , and joined up with guitarist @entity25 and vocalist @entity26 to form a group			1
@entity4 were famously non-surfers but that did n't stop them tapping into the sun , sea and sand culture of the @entity33 the @entity35 home on 119th street , where the boys taped their first single @entity38 ' in 1961 , was demolished to make way for @entity40			1
the rest of the street remains though , its neat lawns , porches and fluttering flags reminders of the group 's clean - cut @entity47 origins			1
a redbrick memorial now stands at the site of the @entity51 , with a bas - relief frieze showing the group carrying a surfboard and a plaque noting that the music conceived here ' broadcast to the world an image of @entity3 as a place of sun , surf and romance '			1
@entity63 is indeed a place of sun ( 263 days a year ) but no surf and little romance			1
it 's a charmless city that expanded on the back of the post-war aviation industry ( @entity71 is only five miles away )			1
i could see why the teenagers of the 1950s would get ' bugged ' driving ' up and down the same old strip '			1
@entity78 , with its low - rise jewellery shops and furniture stores , is no place for the young			1
the @entity80 ( @entity21 ) added a splash of colour when it arrived in 1956 and became a home from home for the fledgling @entity4			1
now run by the son of the original owner , it retains its kitsch medieval @entity89 interior , with wrought iron chandeliers , tiled awnings and mock grilled windows			1
surfin ' safari : the town of @entity95 , where the surf is year round , is known as @entity98 @entity99 ( @entity100 ) , another gathering place , is a blue - roofed fast - food outlet that offers food from one service hatch and @entity105 from another			2
when i arrived @entity108 , a 1963 hit by @entity109 , was playing over speakers in the overhang			2
this was the very ' hamburger stand ' where @entity114 saw a girl pull up in her father 's @entity116 and had the inspiration for @entity119			2
@entity122 , around the corner on @entity121 , is where the @entity114 boys and @entity25 attended			2
@entity4 came back to play the 1969 prom and honoured the institution in their song @entity127			1
the nearest surfing beach to @entity21 is @entity129 , but the best is @entity95 , better known as @entity98			2
here the sand is soft , the surf is year - round , and the broad beaches stretch for more than eight miles			2
the broad beaches of @entity95 stretch for more than eight miles other than @entity134 , @entity4 were famously non-surfers , but they were smart enough to observe the burgeoning oceanside culture and knew there was mileage in chronicling it			1
they mentioned @entity95 in @entity142			2
the city of @entity95 makes much of its surfers			2
there 's a @entity146 , a @entity147 and a small @entity148			2
the sports shops sell everything from boards and wetsuits to sunglasses , caps and jeans			2
my hotel , the @entity158 had a surfboard in the foyer and doorknob signs that read wiped out rather than @entity163			2
@entity95 is better known as @entity98 - where the fantastic surf is year - round it was cold and overcast on my first morning but by 8.30am there were already more than 100 surfer bobbing about in the ocean			2
from the the @entity169 could watch them mounting their boards and waiting patiently to ride in on the most powerful of the tall , grey waves			2
as if on cue , a local surf music tribute band , @entity172 , dressed in faded blue denims and short - sleeved @entity175 shirts , began playing at the pier entrance			1
an even better insight into surf culture and music came a few days later when @entity183 drummer @entity182 took me to an outdoor gig in @entity185 , @entity186 , where he played with bassist @entity187 ( ex-nomads ) , and guitarists @entity191 ( @entity190 and his @entity193 ) and @entity194 ( the @entity189 )			2
we picked up @entity194 from his apartment			0
he was wearing a baseball cap , blue jeans and sandals and had a black patch over his left eye			0
on the drive down he told me his story			1
as a 15 - year old schoolboy in 1961 he 'd composed a hit tune called mr @entity208 for @entity189			0
@entity186 , just south of @entity3 , has its own strong surf culture such as at @entity211 that summer , when playing at the @entity213 in @entity214 , a leading surfer came over to him and said : ' wow , man ! your music sounds just like it feels out on a wave			0
you should call it surf music			0
when @entity4 adopted this sound the hard - core sports crowd initially shunned them			1
' as long as they posed as surfers they were resented by those in the true beach culture , ' @entity194 told me			0
' but when they went on to celebrate @entity14 youth culture at large by singing about cars and cruising , that broadened their appeal			1
after that , even surfers appreciated them			0
' when @entity4 started recording their focus shifted from @entity21 to @entity239			1
they signed with @entity240 , whose 13 - storey circular tower at 1750 @entity243 , built in 1956 , has become an @entity3 landmark			0
legend has it that the architecture was based on the image of a bunch of singles stacked on the spindle of a record player			0
the night i visited , @entity254 were playing a promotional set on a specially built platform outside the tower			0
@entity4 ' earliest albums were recorded at @entity240 but by the time of @entity260 and @entity261 , they were also recording around the corner at @entity263 and @entity264 ( 6050 @entity265 )			1
at the @entity267 there are plenty of cars from the era @entity4 celebrated now called @entity272 , this is where they recorded their 2012 comeback album @entity276			1
in 1965 , @entity114 bought the then modern 1448 @entity277 in @entity278 with its great views over the @entity3 basin			0
it was here that he notoriously built himself a huge sandbox in the living room to stimulate his creative juices			0
( the video for @entity287 was filmed in the garden pool			0
) two years later he moved to 10452 @entity289 in the more upmarket gated community of @entity291			0
several @entity4 ' albums , including @entity293 , @entity294 , 20/20 and @entity295 , were partially recorded here , while @entity296 , a fringe figure on the @entity3 music scene in 1969 , visited to tape songs that he 'd written			1
in songs such as @entity261 , @entity300 , @entity302 , and @entity119 , @entity4 explored the parallel teenage subculture of cruising and hot - rodding			1
illegal street racing still takes place but usually in the early hours of the morning , and it 's a crime even to be a spectator			0
in 1967 @entity309 to a more upmarket gated community in the exclusive area of @entity291 custom car shows tend to happen out in the desert rather than in the city			0
but at the @entity267 ( 6060 @entity316 ) it 's possible to see everything from hot rods and deuce coupes to @entity320 and @entity321			0
spread over two spacious floors , there are plenty of cars from the era @entity4 celebrated - a peach - coloured 1957 @entity327 once owned by @entity328 , a black 1957 @entity329 , and a wonderful boat - sized 1959 red @entity330			1
the hot rod section has a classic @entity333 customised from a 1932 @entity334			0
appropriately the museum cafe , @entity335 , is a 50s - style diner with red plastic seating , chrome surfaces and neon signs			0
on my final day i headed north on the @entity341 to @entity342			1
there 's probably no road that better embraces the geographical joys of @entity3 - steep hills and canyons to one side , broad beaches and ocean to the other - and no drive is better suited to a @entity4 ' soundtrack			1
the group even recorded a song about it in 2012			0
a left - hand turn took me a mile down a hill to a private beach edged with cliffs where the group was photographed for the cover of 1962 's @entity142 , and again two years later for @entity362			0
@entity355 is not really a top surf destination despite all the surfboard - shaped signs @entity355 is now home to one of the world 's most luxurious trailer parks			0
film directors , screenwriters , models and @entity239 actors such as @entity373 and @entity374 have swapped bricks and mortar for transportable homes with a view			0
a surfboard - shaped sign ironically declared @entity381			0
the warning was somewhat redundant as beaches can be private but the sea is free and , anyway , the waves are so mild that no serious surfer would choose it			0
maybe that 's why @entity4 came here - and why they kept their shirts and jeans on during the shoot			1
@entity393 ( virginholidays.co.uk , 0844 557 3859 ) offers five nights at the @entity395 in @entity95 from Â£ 915pp			0
this includes return flights from @entity398 , accommodation on a room - only basis and car hire			0
for further information on @entity3 visit @entity404			0

a trip though @entity14 to discover what inspired the *blassic* band
there is no drive better suited to a @entity4 soundtrack than the @entity341 , says the @entity414 writer
