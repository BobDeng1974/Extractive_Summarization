by @entity0 last updated at 12:52 am on 10th january 2012 if you had the odd moment of deja vu during the last series of @entity5 , then do n’t worry – there ’s a reason some of those beautiful gowns looked familiar			1
despite the @entity12 show ’s £ 12million budget , attentive viewers may have spotted that some of its leading ladies wore @entity17 hand - me - downs			0
lavish dresses worn by stars including @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 have been recycled and given the @entity5 treatment to save money			1
truly vintage : @entity25 , pictured left in a blouse first worn by @entity21 's character @entity28 , pictured right a red dress worn by @entity32 as @entity33 , for example , was first seen on miss @entity20 in the 2007 thriller @entity35			1
in fact the pair have shared two outfits			0
the second is a floral blouse first worn by @entity41 20 years ago in the film @entity43			1
it was then passed on to miss @entity20 , again in @entity35 , before ending up in @entity25 ’s wardrobe			1
it is not the only costume shared by @entity20 and @entity48			1
the @entity5 actress recycles a red dress worn by the @entity51 in the same 2007 film opposite @entity53			2
continuing the trend , @entity48 wears a fetching silky green dress with sheer arms , a frock that had previously been worn by @entity58 when portraying the wife of @entity61 author @entity60 in @entity62 in 2004			1
oddly familiar : @entity63 , pictured left in an adapted dress worn by @entity22 's character in @entity67 and on a separate occasion , she is seen in an elaborate black choker so distinctive that viewers remembered @entity71 wearing the same accessory in the film @entity74 almost a decade ago			1
@entity76 - eyed viewers also noticed that @entity63 , played by @entity77 , wore an adapted version of a dress sported 12 years ago by @entity80 , in @entity81 ’s @entity67			0
and in the first series , @entity83 ’s @entity82 wore a white dress from @entity12 ’s 2007 adaptation of @entity88 ’s @entity87			0
according to @entity89 , a designer who runs @entity90 this is common practice on expensive productions to ensure budgets do n't overrun			2
she states : ' recycled movie costumes are gowns that often appear in one production and then go on to be used in another			2
' many movies have very small costume budgets , which means that instead of making all of the costumes , the designer is forced to rent costumes from a costume house			0
mirror image : lady @entity82 , pictured left , in a dress worn by @entity106 's character in @entity12 's @entity87 ' sometimes costumes are altered significantly to give it a new look , and sometimes the dress is used as it appeared for the first time			2
' @entity5 ’s costume designer @entity112 has previously said only a third of the show ’s outfits are new			2
‘ we could n’t have done all of them – it would have cost a fortune , way over our budget , ’ she said			2
@entity123 , whose costume firm @entity125 provided many of @entity5 ’s frocks , said : ‘ i would say around two - thirds of the costumes you see in @entity5 are from stock and have been used before			1
' there is nothing wrong with that			0
you ca n’t supply originals to everyone because it would make an already expensive programme simply unaffordable			1
’ @entity48 is not the only actress that has been caught out by eagle - eyed viewers			0
@entity77 , who plays @entity63 , adorns a very similar outfit to @entity22 's character in @entity67 , although the gown appears to have been altered slightly by dressmakers			1
seeing double : @entity32 's @entity25 in a red dress , pictured left ... and the original first work by @entity20 in @entity35 in 2007 dame @entity148 as @entity149 , @entity150 of @entity151 also appears in a long - sleeved , teal silk dress			1
as worn by @entity80 in the same 2000 film			0
despite the cost cutting measure , some characters , such as @entity156 ’s @entity155 , were dressed entirely in outfits hired from outside			0
@entity90 , showcases many similar examples from other period dramas			0
one brown dress has appeared in seven productions over the past 15 years , including @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 and @entity166			0
meanwhile , a yellow ball gown created for the 1994 film @entity168 has made six more appearances , one of them in a 2006 episode of @entity171			0
@entity5 , which tells the story of a fictional estate in @entity174 , first aired in september 2010 and has since been nominated for four @entity175			0
a third season will be broadcast in september this year			0
