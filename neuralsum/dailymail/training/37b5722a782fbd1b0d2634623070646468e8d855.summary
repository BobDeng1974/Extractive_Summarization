@entity0 were shocking in pink in @entity2 on sunday night as they were beaten 4 - 2 by @entity3			1
just 100 days after their @entity4 triumph , the balance of the team that won the club its 10th @entity4 looks to have been seriously upset by the sale of @entity10 and @entity11			0
supporters will now be asking why they have signed @entity14 substitute @entity13 and not the @entity16 striker @entity15 they were craving			0
goalkeeper @entity50 said : ' after 15 minutes we thought the victory was ours but in the end it was a horrible performance from us and we have to learn from this			0
' we have a very important badge on our shirts and we have to honour that			0
we have all been guilty tonight			0
it was not just the defensive performance the whole team has to be held responsible			0
' before the nightmare last hour of the game , @entity24 's side dominated			2
it took them just six minutes to take the lead with @entity58 's perfect corner planted on to the head of @entity54 , who thundered it past @entity30			1
@entity54 nearly doubled his tally , and @entity0 's lead , on nine minutes when he hit the cross-bar with a free - kick from the edge of the area			1
it was a let - off for the home side but there was no respite as @entity60 made it two from @entity56 's pass			1
the quick nutmeg of hapless @entity3 defender @entity32 was magical and the quick left - footed finish lethal			1
@entity3 were all at sea and they should have been lost without trace before half - time but @entity3 let them back into the game with some woeful finishing and some terrible defending			1
@entity61 might have headed in a third when an awful back pass from @entity114 put the @entity115 through on the keeper but as the two challenged for the ball @entity118 did enough to prevent the striker making contact			0
@entity59 then got to the byline and dragged the centre back to @entity55 whose first time shot was palmed away by @entity30			0
@entity54 then headed over from a corner with what could have been goal number five in the first 25 minutes			2
strike : @entity60 puts @entity0 2 - 0 up in the 11th minute after a cheeky nutmeg and tidy finish with the left boot into the far - right corner of the goal better times : @entity133 thought they were cruising in @entity135 - and they were - until the home side took control towards the end of the opening half who needs @entity17 ? @entity17 was missed in the end by the @entity0 club as they fell to their first defeat of the @entity28 season after winning their first last week former @entity145 midfielder @entity36 finally gave @entity3 's supporters something do other than whistle their own side when his vicious shot was blocked acrobatically by @entity54 on the edge of the six - yard box			1
@entity51 then jumped clumsily into @entity152 and the referee could easily have pointed to the spot			0
it was the start of a poor period of play from @entity0 's right - back and it was the key to @entity3 's revival			1
he was beaten by @entity37 in the air with the midfielder flicking on a corner that reached @entity164 at the back post			2
the defender swept in unmarked and with @entity54 spectating he pulled a goal back			2
@entity51 was again at fault when incredibly the home side were back on level terms			1
he failed to get close enough to @entity171 and the left back had time and space to send over the perfect cross for @entity175 to head home			0
thanks : @entity164 ( pictured ) brought @entity3 back into the game at 2 - 1 with his simple tap - in at the back post after a flick at the front from @entity37 hard to take : @entity54 on his knees during the 4 - 2 defeat as @entity3 struggled to take charge over @entity3 in the second half after a more promising first 45 minutes @entity3 could have been behind as early as minute three of the second half but @entity42 headed well wide from close range with only @entity50 to beat			1
@entity0 were desperately missing the running of @entity188 and the oragnisation of @entity11 with their midfield too easily bypassed by @entity3 's			2
defender @entity53 was seen screaming at the quartet of @entity192 , new £ 75million man @entity25 and @entity56 to play closer to the back four but the warnings were not heeded and soon @entity3 had the lead			2
on 66 minutes it was a former @entity3 player who helped inflict the killer blow			2
@entity198 had come on as a sub along with former @entity200 stirker @entity43			0
he turned away from @entity54 and crossed to the edge of the six - yard box			0
@entity114 got to the ball first ahead of @entity51 to smash it high into @entity50 ' net			0
with 15 minutes left @entity43 controlled the ball with his arm inside the penalty area and when the whistle did not go , he gleefully rifled the ball past @entity50 to make it 4 - 2			1
@entity24 reacted by taking off @entity51 and brining on @entity52 – hardly the sort of change that was going to get real back into the game but with @entity17 injured the visitiors had no forwards on the bench			1
@entity14 striker @entity13 is being brought in for exactly that reason			0
impact from the bench will be his job description , on sunday night in @entity2 that was needed more than ever			0
the game had started as a must - win match for @entity3 manager @entity224 it ended with the dark clouds of doubt gathering of @entity24 who must sort the mess out quickly before the @entity0 derby and the start of the @entity4 after the international break			1
celebration : sociedad emerged 4 - 2 victors over @entity0 on their home turf but were not expected to do so with the likes of @entity238 still on show gutted : @entity55 gestures during the 4 - 2 loss as @entity3 failed to light up the @entity28 match without the rested @entity17 , who is regaining his match fitness			1

@entity0 let two - goal lead slip in @entity2 as @entity3 emerge 4 - 2 victors in @entity28 clash
@entity24 was without @entity17 , who was rested , and *relied* on @entity60 , @entity247
@entity54 and a nice @entity60 finish put real 2 - 0 up after 11 minutes , only for the home side to come back into it
goals from @entity164 , substitute @entity43 and @entity39 mean @entity3 return to @entity0 empty - handed
