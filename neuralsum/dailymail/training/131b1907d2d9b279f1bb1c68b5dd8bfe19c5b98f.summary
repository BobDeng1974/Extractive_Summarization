by @entity0 published : 17:43 est , 23 october 2013 updated : 19:07 est , 23 october 2013 smoking and drinking should no longer be termed ‘ risky behaviours ’ because it is too judgmental , says the chief medical officer for @entity4			2
instead , binge - drinking , unprotected sex and taking drugs should be renamed ‘ exploratory behaviours ’ in ‘ order to be fair and destigmatise ’ them			1
professor dame @entity11 said that young people had expressed the concern that behaviour that was dubbed risky when they did it was commonplace among adults			1
' @entity16 ' : professor dame @entity11 said drinking and smoking should not be deemed ' risky ' ( picture posed by models ) public health campaigns frequently urge restraint when it comes to activities that could affect the health of youngsters			1
but professor @entity27 insisted that changing the terms would not encourage children to experiment , but offer chances for health professionals to make such behaviour appear less risky and perhaps less appealing to those tempted to experiment			0
this could be achieved , for example , by recommending the use of condoms during sex to avoid pregnancy and infections			0
however , the @entity41 – which advises on how public health campaigns on smoking , unprotected sex and binge drinking should be delivered – said those covering on ‘ risky behaviour ’ such as smoking need to scare an audience as well as soothe them in order to get people to take care of their health			2
drugs : professor @entity27 insisted changing the terms would not encourage children to experiment @entity57 also advises that ‘ threatening ’ and ‘ supportive ’ styles of delivery are the best way to get a message across about ‘ risky behaviour ’			0
however , professor @entity27 said that a non-judgmental term would result in conversations with health professionals ‘ so they are able to say no ’			0
she suggested that school nurses could play a crucial role , because young people trusted them			1
but she warned about the lack of them , saying one nurse for every 6,000 children was not enough .			0

professor dame @entity11 said the term is judgmental
binge - drinking , unprotected sex and taking drugs are all ' exploratory '
she suggested school nurses could play crucial role
