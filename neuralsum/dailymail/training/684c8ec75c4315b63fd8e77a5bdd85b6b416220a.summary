by @entity0 in @entity1 and @entity2 the mother of an unruly teen who was shipped to @entity5 in 2011 has refused to bring the desperate 17 - year - old back to @entity7 , claiming she did n't live up to her end of the bargain			1
@entity10 , 36 , sent her daughter , @entity11 , from @entity12 , @entity13 , to live with her biological father in the frigid city of @entity16 after she failed at school , ran away from home and stole $ 1,000			1
but two - and - a - half years later , the stern mother insists the teen still has n't learned her lesson , even though she claims her dad abused her			1
' she had to meet two conditions to come back ; finish school and show she 's changed , ' @entity10 told @entity24			2
' hard : @entity10 , 36 , sent her daughter @entity11 , pictured , from @entity12 , @entity13 , to live with her father in the frigid @entity16 after she failed at school , ran away from home and stole $ 1,000 @entity28 is growing increasingly desperate , as when she turns 18 she 'll find it tougher to get back to @entity7			1
this is because she 's a @entity31 citizen , despite growing up her whole life in @entity7			1
' i ca n't understand it , ' she told people			2
' i just want to come home			2
' last month , @entity28 launched an online campaign to get home , claiming she was beaten by her father , @entity40 , and was so miserable she tried to commit suicide			1
this week , @entity42 reported the teen is planning to press criminal charges against @entity40 for alleged inappropriate behavior			0
in a recent visit to his flat , which was caught on video and broadcast around @entity31 , he is seen shoving her friend @entity49			2
@entity28 was a typical @entity7 teenager attending @entity52 when she was sent away			1
she was born in @entity5 and her @entity5 father still lives there - but she had n't been there since she was two and did not speak any @entity31			1
despite this , she was packed off almost 6,000 miles to meet her birth father @entity40 - who spoke no @entity56 - as an apparent punishment for her teenage transgressions			2
originally she was told she would stay three weeks , but once in @entity5 , her mother - who is a @entity7 citizen - told her that it would be much longer , and she is now well into her third year in @entity31			1
plea : she has written yet another letter ( pictured ) to her mother , who lives in @entity13 , but she said that she is not helping to speed up her return			1
she claims she has been beaten by her @entity5 father since arriving there in march 2011 , she revealed how she was forced to leave her father 's home because he beat her and was often drunk			1
in a children 's center , with the possibility of being consigned to a grim orphanage , she tried to take her own life before going back to her father - because she thought if she did so her mother would allow her back to @entity7			1
her appeals to the @entity7 embassy and @entity76 's ombudsman for children , @entity72 , have all met with no response , she said			2
in october , she was tracked down by @entity42 to a @entity16 hostel where she lives and works a 60 hour week , including nights , to earn her keep and pay for her studies			0
now 17 , she penned a heartfelt letter to her mother in her latest desperate bid to be allowed back from @entity5 where she says she has few friends and feels an outsider			1
@entity86 : @entity87 , pictured , says , two - and - a - half years later , the teen still has n't learned her lesson ' @entity90 all that is going on i really hope that our relationship could improve rather than be completely destroyed to shreds , ' she wrote			1
' i love you so much and i miss you and @entity97 ( her half - sister )			0
i want to come home			2
to come back to you			0
' i ask you one more time , please take me back			0
please find it in your heart to forgive my mistakes that i made as a pre-teen			0
you are the only family that i have			0
' her step - father @entity105 is an immigration attorney who has said her behavior as a teen was ' uncontrollable ' , including inviting boys home without permission			2
' the behavior was becoming worse and we saw no solution			0
worse , it was affecting the other children in the house , especially the outbursts that would last until 2am , ' he told @entity119 in an email			0
@entity28 is convinced he was behind her @entity5 punishment , and that without him , her mother would not have sent her into exile			1
@entity87 added : ' sending @entity28 to her father , grandparents , uncle , aunt , and cousin was not an easy choice that we had to make , but it was the right choice			1
' but @entity28 she said she has hardly seen these other relatives			2
@entity28 confessed her behavior was poor before she was sent away - she once stole more than $ 1000 in cash , but she denies she ever took drugs and believes she has more than paid the price for any adolescent excesses			1
' i was 14 years old			2
i made many mistakes , ' she admitted			0
' the one big mistake i made , i did take money			0
i entered into the room and just saw it			0
i do n't know why , i just took the money			2
' and then my mother asked me , where i got this money from and i panicked and i told her that i sold drugs			0
it was biggest mistake of my life			2
desperate : ' i ca n't understand it , ' @entity28 , pictured , told people this week			1
' i just want to come home ' new home : @entity28 , who spoke no @entity31 when she moved to @entity5 , now lives in a hostel in @entity16 drama : this week , @entity42 reported the teen is planning to press criminal charges against @entity40 , pictured , for alleged inappropriate behavior ' i never did drugs , i never sold drugs			1
i told her later , that it was not true , that i stole the money			0
she told me - do you understand , you said that you sold drugs and it is too late now			0
' i was already here , when i told her			0
because after that day , i was on the plane two days later			0
it was one week after my 15th birthday			0
' she was put into a @entity31 school in the @entity5 outpost of @entity179 and only a friendly @entity56 language teacher helped her survive , she said			1
later she was helped to find a job in @entity16 , @entity5 's largest city where she works 60 hours a week			2
' i pay for my school			0
i study via the @entity184			0
i want to graduate in an @entity7 school			1
and i just hope it is not a scam , ' she said			0
more than anything , her dream is to be home - in @entity7 - for @entity193			1
' i begged her millions of times			0
@entity195 said , " i want my mom			0
i do n't have anything here , " ' she said			0
her case has been publicized in the @entity7 thanks to the heroic action of her school friends like @entity205 and @entity206 who can not bear the cruelty she is suffering			1
yet it is far from certain she will return to the @entity7			1
if she turns 18 before being allowed back , and her birthday is next march , immigration rules will make it harder for her to return .			0
