she has slept with 10,091 men , binged on cocaine and blew tens of thousands of dollars on a new car and clothes			1
now @entity5 has lifted the lid on the world of escorts - revealing her seedy lifestyle despite being raised by devout @entity10			2
at the height of her career , ms @entity5 was paid $ 500 to $ 1000 an hour as a elite escort			1
ms @entity5 worked all over @entity18 and was flown to exotic destinations to do her job			1
but despite the good times she had as an escort , the 36 - year - old said if she could have her time over again , she would not have gone down that path			1
in her recently released book - appropriately titled 10,000 men and @entity34 - ms @entity5 writes very frankly about how she was gang - raped at 18 , started dancing on table tops at 19 and how she became a ' high - end ' escort by 21			1
but the now - business entrepreneur did n't start her life out as a wild child			1
the @entity41 woman was born into a family with deep christian values and wanted to ' save herself ' until the right man came along			2
she started in the sex industry when she was 21 years old after she was a table top dancer for three years but after she was gang - raped during a night - out at a club , coupled with her low self - esteem and her lust for money , she started off table top dancing before heading into sex work			1
' i saw an ad for table top dancing back when i was about 19 , ' ms @entity5 said			1
' i was very naïve - it ’s like i fell off the bus			2
' i got pretty drunk and i made $ 1000 cash on the first night			2
' i thought that was amazing and i thought " i must be quite decent at it "			0
' to cover up she was an escort , the now 36 - year - old told her parents she was modelling later in her career ms @entity5 ' worked up the ladder ' expanding her services to all over @entity18 the positive attention she was getting from clients was a far cry from her days of being bullied in high school			1
' it actually gave me the confidence i never had , ' she said			0
' for the first time , i connected with people , with the other girls , and it made me flourish			2
' it was like a family			0
that ’s the good side of it			0
' but after three years , ms @entity5 took the leap into the world of escorting - working mostly in @entity41			1
later in her career , as she ' worked up the ladder ' , she expanded her services to all over @entity18 and other parts of the world where escorting was legal			1
@entity5 - a pseudonym she created to pen her book - said she went by many names while she worked in the industry			1
the thousands and thousands ms @entity5 earned as an escort was spent on a new car and luxury clothing but the face on her book was her real face			1
' all the photos of me is like me " coming out " , ' she said			0
' i did n't want to go by my real name because obviously i wanted to protect my elderly mother , who is 77 , from it all			0
' i 've gone by a few working names			0
one of them i went under was @entity106			0
i had to have a sexier escort name and who better than @entity106 ? ' ms @entity5 said her main clients were white - collar workers peppered with well - known faces - including lawyers , politicians and musicians			1
to ease her guilt and numb her to the idea of being an escort , ms @entity5 blew the ' thousands and thousands ' she earned on a new car and clothes			1
she lives in @entity41 and was raised by devout @entity10 parents			2
ms @entity5 is now a business entrepreneur ' when i moved up in the escort world , i was meeting more influential and richer clients and i had my first experience with cocaine in my early 20s and it was real @entity129 stuff – he was a multi-millionaire			1
i thought : " wow , this is really cool " , ' she said			0
' i ended up actually taking cocaine for six to eight months and i was also on speed			0
' it was a lifestyle of cocaine , speed and @entity137 champagne			0
' it was this kind of destructive lifestyle that motivated ms @entity5 to pen her book			1
' people have certain perceptions of escorts - you do n't know who could get into it - and i wanted to de-stigmatise it , ' she said			2
' for those who want to go in to it , i want to get them to really think about it because once you get into it , it really lives with you			0
' and i also just wanted to give those people in the [ sex ] industry a voice because i 'm a human being , they 're human beings			2
' the main thing for me is that if i can change one person from making that decision [ to enter the industry ] then i would have done something good , something meaningful and that would mean a lot to me			2
' but there was no one to help ms @entity5 when her life was skidding out of control and she wanted to get out of industry			1
' the money was why i stayed for so long			0
i was earning thousands upon thousands a week , ' she said			0
' money was like a drug - it let me fly around the world			2
' one of the few perks of her job was being flown around the world and let her escape the reality she was living in			2
' one of the most memorable moments i have was getting flown out to @entity185 , ' ms @entity5 said			1
' it was a companionship - it was more a boyfriend experience booking			2
what made it so memorable was it was beautiful there and i felt like a princess			0
' it was really funny because it did n't feel like work as it were			0
' it was just an escape for me - i was treated like a human being - so it was pure escapism for me			0
' @entity5 has finally achieved her dream of becoming a fully licensed commercial pilot at 29 years old unfortunately for ms @entity5 her new - found career was cut short because of kidney failure , preventing her from renewing her pilot 's license ms @entity5 would disguise the money she made through promotional modelling jobs during her days as an escort @entity5 chose @entity106 as her pseudonym inspired by the actress @entity106 though ms @entity5 said she had no ' horror stories ' to tell about her time as an escort , she desperately tried to turn her back on the industry			1
after she was almost killed in a car crash at the age of 24 while driving her @entity215 , ms @entity5 made the brave decision to get out			1
' i walked away with severe whiplash and shock and bruises , but i was lucky i walked away virtually unscathed , ' she said			0
' thank @entity221 for @entity223 engineering			0
it was really my wake - up call			0
' at the time of the crash , ms @entity5 's parents thought she was earning her wage as a model but the trauma of her accident sparked a hospital - bed confession about what she was really doing with her life			1
' money was like a drug - it let me fly around the world : ' ms @entity5 said the temptation of making good money while escorting was one she could not refuse ms @entity5 writes very frankly in her newly released book about how she was gang - raped at 18 , started dancing on table tops at 19 and how she became a ' high - end ' escort by 21			1
' i was very close to my parents , particularly my dad , ' she said			0
' i did a little bit of promotional modelling , and how i was able to hide my money and i was able to disguise my money outwardly - new clothes and a new car and everything - was by explaining it through the modelling work i did			0
' i was able to hide it pretty well but it was killing me on the inside to keep it such a secret too			0
' luckily for ms @entity5 , even though they did n't like it , her parents were understanding and supportive when they discovered the truth			1
after the accident , things started to look up when she finally achieved her dream of becoming a fully licensed commercial pilot at 29 years old			0
but her new life as a charter pilot and doing scenic tours was cut short when she diagnosed with kidney failure , which prevented her from getting medical approval to keep her licence			0
again ms @entity5 fell back into the industry , but finally at 33 she retired and cut off all ties with it when she met her business partner , known only as @entity278			1
she started a course in neuro - linguistic programming and together with @entity278 they started building a business			2
' it ’s like mind science – like ( famous @entity286 life coach ) @entity288 does – it ’s like a new age psychology , and it really helped me deal with a lot of my issues , ' she said .			0
