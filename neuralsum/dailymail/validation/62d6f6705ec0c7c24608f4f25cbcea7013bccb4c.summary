a 21 - year - old man has undergone the world 's first successful penis transplant			1
the ' ground - breaking ' operation took @entity5 surgeons nine hours to perform , and allowed the patient to urinate normally and become sexually active again			1
three years ago the man , who remains unidentified , was forced to have his penis amputated after a botched circumcision			1
each year thousands of young men , mainly from the @entity12 tribe in @entity5 , have their foreskins removed in traditional rituals , with experts estimating around 250 losing their penises each year to medical complications			1
they said the procedure allowed the man to regain all function in the newly transplanted organ			2
nine more patients will now receive penile transplants			0
professor @entity38 , head of the @entity28 's @entity39 , said they were surprised by the patient 's rapid recovery			2
he said : ' our goal was that he would be fully functional at two years and we are very surprised by his rapid recovery			2
professor @entity45 , another of the hospital 's surgeons who assisted on the operation , said : ' it 's a massive breakthrough			1
we 've proved that it can be done – we can give someone an organ that is just as good as the one that he had			0
' ' it was a privilege to be part of this first successful penis transplant in the world			2
' professor van der @entity38 said having a penis amputated is known to have a seriously adverse psychological effect on men			2
' this is a very serious situation , ' he said			0
' for a young man of 18 or 19 years the loss of his penis can be deeply traumatic			2
as part of the procedure , doctors transplanted a new penis , donated by a deceased man			1
the pictures , left and right , show the veins and blood vessels they connected after the nine hour operation , the man recovered rapidly			1
the procedure has allowed him to become sexually active again			0
the picture shows how the nerves of the donated penis were joined to the man 's genital region he does n't necessarily have the psychological capability to process this			1
there are even reports of suicide among these young men			0
' he added that finding a donor organ was one of the main challenges to the procedures , and called the man who donated his penis , and his family , ' heroes '			1
the procedure was performed as part of a pilot study to develop a penile transplant procedure that could be performed in a typical @entity5 hospital			1
the planning and preparation for the study started in 2010			0
after extensive research professor @entity108 and his surgical team decided to use techniques developed for the first facial transplant			0
the operation was the second time that this type of procedure was attempted , but the first time in history that a successful long - term result was achieved			0
image shows the nerves in the donated penis , which were joined to the man 's groin area			1
this was the first successful operation of its kind , as a previous attempt did not lead to long - term recovery a man in @entity131 received a transplant in 2005 but that man asked surgeons to remove the new organ two weeks later			1
professor @entity136 said the procedure could eventually also be extended to men who have lost their penises from penile cancer or as a last - resort treatment for severe erectile dysfunction due to the side effects from medication			0
the @entity145 praised surgeons who performed the operation			0
dr @entity148 , head of @entity149 , said : ' we are very proud to be part of this ground - breaking scientific achievement			0
' it is good to know that a young man 's life has been significantly changed with this very complex surgical feat. ' from experience we know that penile dysfunction and disfigurement has a major adverse psychological effect on people			0
