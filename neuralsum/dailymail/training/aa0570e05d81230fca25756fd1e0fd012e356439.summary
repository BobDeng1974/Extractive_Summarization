roman gladiators were subjected to strict training regimes , hours of physically exhausting tasks and battled to the death			0
but instead of eating a diet rich in protein like modern athletes , evidence suggests they managed these tasks on a diet of grain , washed down with a ‘ sports drink ’ of vinegar and ash			1
@entity15 researchers studied the collagen in the bones of @entity19 corpses found in a 2nd century cemetery to confirm theories of this vegetarian diet			1
researchers from the @entity24 examined bones from a 2nd century gladiator cemetery ( pictured ) in @entity27			1
using spectroscopy , stable isotope ratios were investigated in the collagen of the bones , and results show that gladiators mostly ate a vegetarian diet and drank a ' tonic of ashes ' as a form of sports drink the cemetery was initially uncovered in 1933 , in the @entity19 city of @entity41 , now in modern - day @entity27			1
at the time , @entity41 was the capital of the roman province of @entity45 and had over 200,000 inhabitants			2
using spectroscopy , researchers from the @entity48 at the @entity24 studied stable isotope ratios , including levels of carbon , nitrogen and sulphur			2
historic sources and ancient texts report that gladiators had their own diet , comprising of beans and grains , and they have been referred to as ‘ hordearii ’ , or ‘ barley eaters ’			1
their diet also featured oatmeal and dried fruit , and it is believed that they may have been larger than modern - day athletes to protect their bodies historic sources and ancient texts report that gladiators had their own diet , comprising of beans and grains , and they have been referred to as ‘ hordearii ’ , or ‘ barley eaters ’			1
the word ‘ barley eater ’ relates to the fact that gladiators were probably given grain of an inferior quality			2
research from @entity81 in @entity24 , which analysed bones found in a 2nd century @entity19 cemetery , has confirmed these claims			1
it found that meals of the individuals they examined would have consisted primarily of grain and meat - free meals			2
all individuals consumed plants including wheat and barley as staple food , while others ate beans			0
the findings also suggested these meals were washed down with a vinegar and plant ash drink , to give them energy , as a form of ancient sports drink			1
despite the strict training regime , gladiators were seen as ' assets ' and were well cared for			0
their diet also featured oatmeal and dried fruit , and it is believed that they may have been larger than modern - day athletes to protect themselves from blows			1
they also looked at the ratio of strontium to calcium in the bone mineral			0
levels of strontium indicate the amount of vegetable matter consumed over a lifetime , and the higher the levels the more likely that the diet is devoid of meat			0
in total , 53 individuals , including 22 gladiators , were analysed			0
the results revealed that meals consisted primarily of grain and meat - free meals			2
all individuals consumed plants including wheat and barley as staple food , while others ate beans			0
the cemetery was initially uncovered in 1933 , in the @entity19 city of @entity41 , now in modern - day @entity27 ( pictured left )			1
the city map of @entity147 is pictured bottom right , with excavations sites shown top right			0
the cemetery is shown labelled @entity151 researchers also looked at the ratio of strontium to calcium in the bone mineral			0
levels of strontium indicate the amount of vegetable matter consumed over a lifetime , the higher the levels the more likely that the diet is devoid of meat			0
all individuals examined ate a diet of wheat ( left ) and barley ( right ) the findings also suggested these meals were washed down with a vinegar and plant ash drink , to give them energy , as a form of ancient sports drink			1
‘ plant ashes were evidently consumed to fortify the body after physical exertion and to promote better bone healing , ’ explained study leader professor @entity177			1
‘ things were similar then to what we do today - we take magnesium and calcium , in the form of effervescent tablets , for example , following physical exertion			0
‘ @entity191 is essential for bone building and usually occurs primarily in milk products			0
’ in total , 53 individuals , including 22 gladiators , were analysed			0
this images shows a gladiator tombstone excavated in the @entity27 cemetery			1
a further research project is looking at the migration of gladiators , who often came from different parts of the @entity19 to @entity147 historic sources and ancient texts report that gladiators had their own diet , comprising of beans and grains , and they have previously been referred to as ‘ hordearii ’ , or ‘ barley eaters ’			1
the word ‘ barley eater ’ relates , in this case , to the fact that gladiators were probably given grain of an inferior quality , explained researcher professor @entity177			2
according to the research , the difference between the diets of gladiators and the ‘ normal population ’ of the region is highly significant in terms of the amount of strontium measured in their bones			2
a further research project is looking at the migration of gladiators , who often came from different parts of the @entity19 to @entity147			2
the researchers are hoping that comparison of the bone data from gladiators with that of the local fauna will yield a number of differences			0
the findings are published in the journal @entity244 .			0

study claims @entity19 gladiators ate grains and beans , with a tonic of ashes
researchers examined bones from a 2nd century gladiator cemetery
it was uncovered in 1933 in the @entity19 city of @entity41 , modern - day @entity27
using spectroscopy , isotopes were investigated in the collagen of the bones
results show gladiators mostly ate a vegetarian diet , consisting of grain
to *counteract* lack of protein , evidence suggests they also drank ‘ ash tonic '
plant ashes mixed with vinegar is said to have been a *pre-cursor* to the modern - day sports drink
