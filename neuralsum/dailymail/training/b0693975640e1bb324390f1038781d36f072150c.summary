by @entity0 published : 07:15 est , 5 july 2013 updated : 18:45 est , 5 july 2013 this is the moment two lazy binmen were caught on camera filling a bin so they did not have to empty it			1
the men rearranged the refuse inside the large wheeled container to ensure the lid was jammed open , even picking up rubbish from the ground and piling it on top			0
they then took a photograph of their handiwork as ‘ proof ’ that the bin was too full for collection , and strolled off			1
now @entity32 council , which employs them , has issued a humiliating apology for the ‘ inexcusably poor service ’ , and has promised to discipline the men after an investigation			0
but the shopkeeper who fell victim to the scam – and was left with the jam - packed bin after it should have been taken away – said the ‘ moronic and inexcusable ’ duo may have pulled the same stunt on countless other taxpayers			1
the @entity30 footage shows the two men arriving at the back of the @entity49 convenience store in the city			1
caught on camera : the workers had no idea they were being filmed as they put extra cardboard into the bin one of the pair finds the large wheelie bin comfortably full , with the lid propped only slightly open			1
he immediately begins ‘ plumping up ’ the rubbish inside to make it appear more full , and pulls a flattened cardboard box partly out , to jam the lid wide open			1
his colleague then joins in , taking out a camera as he prepares to get the photographic evidence to justify them leaving the bin behind			1
several more cardboard boxes from the ground are stuffed casually inside the bin , before a black bin bag is picked up off the ground and placed on top , as the grubby icing on their cake of lies			1
only then is the photograph taken , and the pair stroll off			0
their whole deceitful operation has taken a minute , which could have been spent emptying the bin			2
@entity84 - handed : the pair are seen ' puffin up ' the rubbish so the bin looks even more overfilled the first that shop owner @entity20 knew of the affair was when he found his bin – which he shares with the neighbouring @entity92 – still full			1
he called the council for an explanation , but was promptly told the authority had photographic evidence the bin had been overloaded			1
mr @entity20 said : ‘ we checked our cctv – and could n’t believe our eyes			0
it is totally and utterly ridiculous			0
‘ this is a total disgrace and @entity102 knows how many others this has been done to			0
these actions are moronic and inexcusable			2
’ mr @entity20 added : ‘ in the footage it is apparent that the bin was filled sufficiently and set to be emptied			2
but the bin collectors chose to be indolent and deceitful			0
not happy : mr @entity20 described the binmen 's behaviour as ' moronic ' ‘ not only did they refuse their duty but added to the waste , filling it past the maximum capacity where the bin could no longer close and put a bin bag on top of the bin lid			2
their purpose was clear in making it appear as though we had over-filled the bin			0
‘ not having suitable waste facilities has created an unsafe and unhygienic environment for our customers and employees			0
as a result , we have lost revenue and gained stress			0
’ the council ’s head of refuse collection , @entity134 , said : ‘ we have written to the owner of the premises and apologised for this poor service , which is inexcusable			2
arrangements are being made to investigate this in accordance with the council ’s disciplinary policy			0

shop owner @entity144 , *52* , told his bin had been too full to empty
@entity30 showed two workers adding extra cardboard and black bin bags
one then uses camera to take a photo as ' evidence ' of overfilled bin
@entity156 apologies for ' inexcusable ' behaviour
