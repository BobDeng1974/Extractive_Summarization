@entity0 towers over @entity1 and although many people dream of scaling its summit , there are beautifully remote villages , farms and monasteries nestled within its huge shadow that are also worth a visit			1
last year @entity12 took its @entity14 cameras on a 10 - day trek around the @entity17 region - also known as the @entity16 - to explore these quaint landmarks and locations			1
during the trek the cameras captured the small sherpa village of @entity24 , the @entity26 monastery and @entity27 inside the @entity28			1
during the trek the cameras captured the small sherpa village of @entity24 , the @entity26 monastery and @entity27 inside the @entity28 the trek was led by @entity23 , a 55 - year - old sherpa mountaineer who holds the world record for reaching the summit of @entity0 21 times - more than any other person			1
he scaled the summit for the first time at the age of 30			2
in 2009 , @entity23 founded the non-profit @entity44 to help the local community of young people in the @entity17 region			1
the @entity14 images were captured in march 2014 when @entity23 took members of @entity49 , and the @entity1 nonprofit story cycle through the region			1
@entity0 is the @entity53 's highest mountain , with a peak at 8,848 metres above sea level			1
in 1865 , @entity0 was given its official @entity57 name by the @entity58 upon a recommendation by @entity60 , the @entity61 surveyor general of @entity62			0
mr @entity60 named the mountain after his predecessor in the post , sir @entity66			0
it has become a mecca for climbers , and has two main climbing routes , the southeast ridge from @entity1 and the north ridge from @entity73			2
the southeast ridge was the route used by sir @entity76 and @entity77 when they reached the summit for the first time in 1953			0
' our region is famous for being home to @entity0 , but it ’s also the home of the @entity85 community and has been for centuries , ' @entity23 said			2
' the region has much more to offer than just the mountain			2
so last year , i guided the @entity91 team through my home region to collect @entity14 imagery that improves the map of our community			2
' now you can find @entity24 on the map and explore other communities nestled at the base of @entity0 , like @entity27 and @entity101			1
' @entity24 , and neighbouring upper @entity24 are small sherpa villages in the @entity104 of @entity1			1
@entity77 , one of the first people to climb @entity0 with sir @entity76 grew up in the region and the @entity24 monastery is one of the oldest in @entity17			1
another village captured by the @entity14 trekkers was @entity27			1
it sits 13,000ft ( 3,970 metres ) above sea level near @entity114			1
it is located inside the word heritage site @entity28			0
' when people ask what it feels like to reach the top of @entity0 , i say " heaven , " ' added @entity23			2
' my hope is that my children and future generations have many choices for employment outside of mountaineering			0
' but the images do n't just feature peaks and landscapes			0
@entity12 also captured parts of the @entity101 farming village in the @entity134 including the @entity26 , or small monastery			1
paintings inside the monastery began in 2008 by @entity139 artists and were completed by the end of 2009 using funding from the @entity142			1
the trek was led by @entity23 ( pictured ) , a 55 - year - old sherpa mountaineer who holds the world record for reaching the summit of @entity0 21 times - more than any other person			1
he scaled the summit for the first time at the age of @entity151 2009 , @entity23 founded the non-profit @entity44 to help the local community of young people in the @entity17 region the @entity14 images were captured in march 2014 when @entity23 took members of @entity49 , and the @entity1 nonprofit story cycle through the region			1

@entity77 , one of the first people to climb @entity0 with sir @entity76 , grew up in the region @entity12 also captured parts of @entity101 in the @entity134 , including the @entity26 , or small monastery ( pictured )			1
the paintings on the monastery walls were started in 2008 by @entity139 artists using funding from the @entity142 ' partnering with @entity91 allowed us to get important local landmarks on the map and share a richer view of @entity17 with the world , including local monasteries , lodges , schools and more , with some yaks along the way ! , ' continued @entity23			1
@entity0 : 29,035ft ( 8,850m ) @entity179 : 28,253ft ( 8,612m ) @entity180 : 28,169ft ( 8,586m ) @entity181 : 27,890ft ( 8,501m ) @entity182 : 27,765ft ( 8,462 m ) @entity183 : 26,906ft ( 8,201 m ) @entity184 : 26,794ft ( 8,167m ) @entity185 : 26,758ft ( 8,156m ) @entity186 : 26,658ft ( 8,125m ) @entity187 : 26,545ft ( 8,091m ) @entity188 : 26,470ft ( 8,068m ) @entity189 : 26,400ft ( 8,047m ) @entity190 : 26,360ft ( 8,035m ) @entity191 : 26,289ft ( 8,013m ) ' my hope is that when people see this imagery online , they ’ll have a deeper understanding of the region and the sherpa people that live there			2
' your online trip to my home awaits you on @entity91			0
and if you ever get the chance to visit the @entity17 region in person , come stay at the @entity209 that i built with my own hands			1

' @entity0 is one of 14 mountain peaks on @entity53 that stand taller than 26,000ft ( 8,000m ) and the local @entity1 name for it is @entity215 , which means ' mother of the universe			2
' @entity0 is the tallest of these so - called ‘ eight - thousanders ’ and is the standard to which all other mountains are compared			0
all 14 of them are found in @entity223 , @entity224 or @entity1			0
@entity0 ’s geological story began 40 million years ago when the @entity62 subcontinent began a slow - motion collision with @entity228			0
the edges of the two continents were forced together and formed the tall ridges that make up the @entity232 today			0
glaciers have chiselled @entity0 ’s summit into a huge , triangular pyramid , defined by three faces and three ridges that extend to the northeast , southeast , and northwest			0
the southeastern ridge is the most widely used climbing route			0
it is the one @entity76 and @entity77 followed in may 1953 when they became the first climbers to reach the summit and return safely			0
despite its reputation as an extremely dangerous mountain , commercial guiding has done much to improve the safety of the @entity0 ascent			0
as of march 2012 , there had been 5,656 successful ascents of @entity0 , although 223 people had died at fatality rate of 4 per cent			0
the satellite image was taken in december , just weeks after @entity255 captured the rivers of black lava snaking over the snow - covered slopes of the stratovolcano @entity261 in @entity262			0
in 2012 , mountaineer and filmmaker @entity263 took 477 individual images to create gigapixel image of the @entity267 from the @entity269 viewpoint near @entity0			0
