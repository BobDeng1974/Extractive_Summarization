by @entity0 published : 22:10 est , 26 november 2013 updated : 02:32 est , 27 november 2013 a 42 - year - old man who sued @entity2 for ' slipping on a banana peel ' in a @entity5 station elevator has been charged with fraud after a video shows him planting the slippery skin and purposely tripping himself over			1
@entity9 , from @entity10 , tripped over one night at about 9pm on august 8 as he walked out of an elevator at the busy @entity13 station , saying he fell from a banana peel left on the floor and injured his hip and leg , according to the @entity18			1
he sued the transit agency for $ 15,000 , part of which was for a $ 4,500 chiropractor bill			1
however a recently - found surveillance tape has showed @entity24 was a victim of his own making			1
while it does not clearly show him placing the peel on the ground , you can see movements with his hands and pockets			2
when he steps away from the door while still traveling in the elevator the banana skin can be seen			1
but perhaps the most incriminating piece of footage is a part where @entity24 starts to search for a security camera - and then looks worryingly straight at it			2
as the doors open , @entity24 is sure to step exactly on the skin and then falls forward , before quickly getting up			2
the all - important exit : as the doors open , @entity9 is careful to step directly on the banana peel while walking out woops ! : @entity24 slips and trips while get out of the elevator splat : @entity24 ends up on the floor , with the banana peel being thrown back inside the elevator ( right ) thanks to the video , the @entity2 claim has now been thrown out and @entity24 has subsequently been charged with second - degree fraud			1
' through our investment in digital camera systems across the system , we are demonstrating our commitment to protecting fare - paying riders and the region ’s taxpayers from fraudulent claims , ' @entity2 spokesman @entity82 said			0
@entity24 reported his injuries to the station manager straight away , with @entity94 called			2
@entity24 was then taken to @entity95 for treatment			0
two weeks later he filed a lawsuit			0
in an interview with @entity2 officials , @entity24 had reportedly asked why a custodian for the station had ' not cleaned up the banana peel prior to his entering the elevator ' , according to the police report			1
' what you will see in the camera footage is that the elevator , just prior to mr. @entity9 boarding , shows there ’s nothing on the floor , ' @entity82 said			1
the elevator incident occurred here , at the busy @entity13 metro station in central @entity5 ' he is then seen with what appears to be a banana peel in his hand , looking in the direction of the camera , ' @entity82 said			1
' an object can be seen on the ground , and then when the elevator doors open , he steps on the object , thrusts himself forward and falls out of the elevator			0
' @entity2 presented its case to the @entity130 attorney ’s office			0
a warrant was issued accusing @entity24 of fraud and he was arrested			1
at a hearing this month , a @entity135 judge ordered @entity24 to have a mental - health screening and evaluation			2
he is scheduled to appear in court on monday			0
the case is one of the roughly 225 claims @entity2 ’s @entity144 office receives each month			0
most seek compensation for slips and falls on station platforms , stairs , escalators , elevators and buses , or while getting on and off trains			0
oldest trick in the book : banana peels are notoriously slippery fewer than half of those claims result in a settlement from @entity2 , and the average payout is less than $ 2,500 , @entity82 said			0
over the past few years the agency paid $ 50 to a @entity2 rider who said oil dripped from a rail car ’s air conditioner onto his shirt ; $ 45 to a rider who claimed to have gotten his sandal stuck in an escalator at @entity169 ; $ 104.37 to a driver who said the gate at the @entity169 parking garage came down on his vehicle ; and $ 100 to a person who said he lost his footing while walking down steps at the @entity178 metro station			1
@entity82 noted that @entity2 sometimes opens its own claims			0
' for example , if a person gets transported to the hospital , we will automatically open a claim , ' he said			0
' if the person never gets in touch with us , it is classified as '' abandoned ''			0

@entity9 , *43* , filed a lawsuit against the @entity13 metro station in august after claiming he fell on a banana peel while exiting an elevator and injured his hip and leg
his claim was worth $ 15,000
however a video of the incident shows @entity24 planting the skin on the ground before tripping on it
police have now arrested @entity24 and charged him with second - degree fraud
