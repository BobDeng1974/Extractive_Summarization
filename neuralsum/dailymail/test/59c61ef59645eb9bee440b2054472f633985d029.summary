a report on the threat posed by @entity3 foreign fighters has cited the @entity6 government 's ' troubled relations ' with the @entity8 community as undermining efforts at countering violent extremism			1
the @entity12 report , released on thursday , says the large number of @entity3 fighting in @entity14 and @entity15 represents a ' serious national security threat ' but that the risk of an attack on home soil could be mitigated by the right policy response			1
the new report comes just a day after the news of the death of @entity26 model - turned - jihadist @entity24			1
the @entity3 was reportedly killed in @entity14 while fighting with terrorist organisation @entity27			1
a spokesman for the department told @entity42 consular assistance was no longer available within @entity14 ' due to the extremely dangerous security situation '			0
he further added @entity3 who were involved in overseas conflicts were ' putting their own lives in mortal danger '			0
' any @entity3 fighting with non-state militia in @entity14 or @entity15 should end their involvement in the conflict now and leave the conflict zone , ' the spokesman said			1
' @entity3 are strongly advised not to travel to @entity14 or @entity15 ; any @entity3 in either country should leave immediately			2
' @entity52 's fled to @entity14 from western @entity35			0
his 14 - year - old daughter married @entity34 @entity52 posted a photo last year of his son holding up a severed head , causing international uproar the new report outlines how returned fighters pose a serious threat to @entity3			2
' returned foreign fighters have been involved in many of the most serious jihadist plots in the @entity65 , including in @entity3 , ' the report says			2
' returnees from @entity14 have already engaged in terrorist plots in @entity68 , and the large number of @entity3 involved with groups such as @entity71 ( @entity27 ) and @entity72 raises well - founded fears of an increased threat at home			1
' while much of the responsibility in dealing with the threat will lie with the police and intelligence services , the report says , it adds that programs aimed at countering violent extremism ( @entity84 ) need to be a core element of the response			0
the report says ' questions remain ' as to how any new @entity84 approach will be implemented by the government , and that ' troubled relations with @entity3 's @entity8 communities mean that its efforts to counter violent extremism are not off to the strongest of starts '			0
propaganda prop : @entity97 , 17 , from western @entity35 , featured in a high - definition @entity27 broadcast earlier this year @entity3 @entity98 , who is known as the ' @entity99 ' , died recently while fighting for is @entity26 woman @entity100 ( pictured above ) was married to @entity101 and has threatened @entity3 a successful @entity84 approach should draw on the talent that already exists within relevant communities , the report said , but that ' community co-operation has been undermined ' by a lack of information about changes to the government 's approach , including funding of grant schemes			1
' moreover , the poor consultation by the government with the @entity8 community on much of @entity3 's new counter-terrorism legislation as well as the prime minister 's ( @entity6 ) claim that @entity8 leaders are not doing enough to speak out against radical ideas have undermined the prospects for effective co-operation			0
' the report said the @entity6 government 's introduction of number of @entity84 programs , such as $ 13.4 million living safe together initiative , had been welcomed but that there were also valuable lessons to be learned from @entity68 countries , which had more experience in addressing the current foreign fighter threat			0
