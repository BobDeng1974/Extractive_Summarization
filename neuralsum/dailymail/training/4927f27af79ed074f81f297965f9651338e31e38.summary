by @entity0 have you ever wondered what all those thoughts look like as they race around in your brain ? now you can find out using a new system that peers into the storm of activity in real - time			2
the technology , dubbed ‘ @entity9 ’ , was developed by neuroscientist @entity10 and @entity11 , the creator of @entity12			1
the technology was recently unveiled at @entity23 's @entity25 festival where the public were given the chance to look into the mind of mr @entity11 's wife @entity29			2
mrs @entity30 was wearing a cap covered with electroencephalogram ( @entity33 ) electrodes that measure differences in electric potential to record brain activity			2
the structure of the brain is mapped using magnetic resonance imaging ( @entity40 )			2
the user then wears cap covered with electrodes that measure differences in electric potential to record brain activity			0
this activity is revealed on screen			0
the different colours represent the different frequencies of electrical energy in the brain , as well as the paths by which that energy moves around			1
the @entity9 ca n’t be used to show exactly what the user is thinking , but can paint a broad picture of brain activity			1
prior to this , scientists had mapped mrs @entity30 ’s brain structure using magnetic resonance imaging ( @entity40 )			0
the @entity9 ca n’t be used to show exactly what the user is thinking , but can paint a broad picture of brain activity			1
a video of the brain recording was captured by the @entity67 at the @entity68 in @entity69			1
the different colours represent the different frequencies of electrical energy in the brain , as well as the paths by which that energy moves around			1
the white areas are anatomical fibres			0
the technology could be used to help people with brain injuries make a faster recovery			1
‘ we 've never been able to step inside the structures [ of the brain ] and see it in this way , ’ dr @entity10 told @entity80			0
‘ it 's biofeedback on the next level			0
’ mr @entity11 told @entity80 he foresees a day when two people could interact virtually in a way that reveals their inner state			0
the technology was recently unveiled at @entity23 's @entity25 festival where the public were given the chance to look into the mind of mr @entity11 's wife @entity29 ( pictured )			0

@entity9 was developed by neuroscientist and creator of @entity12
technology combines virtual reality , brain scanning and brain recording
it could be used to help people with brain injuries make a faster recovery
the different colours represent the different frequencies of electrical energy in the brain , as well as the paths by which that energy moves
