@entity0 must stick with manager @entity1 as he is the right man to take the club forward , believes former @entity4 ' striker @entity3			1
@entity1 has come under - fire following a disappointing third season with the @entity7 outfit - which has led to some unhappy fans calling for his dismissal			2
not since the 1950 has a previous @entity0 manager gone three campaigns without a trophy , but that is the unwanted fate that will meet the 42 - year - old at the end of this term			2
@entity0 must keep faith with under - fire manager @entity1 , believes @entity19 striker @entity3 the @entity4 ' @entity21 semi-final exit against @entity22 on sunday followed defeat at the same stage of the @entity25 by @entity26			1
a season of false hope was compounded further as the club failed to progress past the @entity31 group stages and were then dumped out of the @entity32 on penalties			0
to make for a gloomier outlook , the @entity35 ' hopes of a top four spot seem remote - as they trail fourth - placed @entity38 by seven points with six games remaining			1
@entity0 's fortunes are in stark contrast to last season when they came agonisingly close to being crowned champions of @entity45 for the first time since 1990			0
and speaking on @entity47 , @entity3 is adamant that @entity1 is still the correct figure to make the @entity4 a force to be reckoned with once more			0
' i believe @entity0 should have patience with @entity1 , ' the @entity51 host said			2
@entity1 ( right ) saw his team dumped out of the @entity21 semi-finals by @entity22 at @entity56 on sunday ' the reasons are quite simple : he is a very good coach , he has a proven track record - going back to @entity26 under @entity59 - of promoting youth , developing youth and giving them an opportunity			1
' what he did n't have , having been at two smaller clubs in @entity65 and @entity66 , is a track record of spending big money , which he needs to do to take @entity0 onto the next level			0
' but , he took @entity0 to two semi-finals this season and they were within a whisker of winning the @entity76 title for the first time ever last season			0
' so , for me , @entity1 is the right man			0
' @entity80 ( centre ) scored the matchwinning goal as @entity22 condemned @entity0 to a 2 - 1 defeat on sunday			1

@entity0 lost 2 - 1 against @entity22 in their @entity21 semi-final on sunday
