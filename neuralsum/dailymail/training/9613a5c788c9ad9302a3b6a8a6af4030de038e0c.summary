by @entity0 this is the terrifying moment a burning car careered towards a hot dog stall in a firefighting display gone wrong			1
the scrap car was set alight as part of a demonstration at @entity8 and @entity9 , with a team of firefighters on hand to extinguish it			1
but as the flames mounted the car began rolling through a cordoned - off area of field towards a food truck			1
this is the moment desperate officials realised the burning car was on course to hit the food stalls officials and firefighters attempted to hold the moving fireball back from the hot dog stand fortunately , the blue @entity29 fire was extinguished without the food stall catching fire firefighters and show officials tried in vain to hold back the blue @entity29 car as the 50 - strong crowd watched on in horror			1
the burning motor finally came to a stop on the tow hitch of the catering unit , which had been evacuated moments before			0
had the car not been stopped by the food truck it would have kept rolling into the funfair behind where dozens of families were enjoying the rides			2
it is thought the car 's engine was running when it was set on fire and onlookers reported seeing the car 's front wheels still moving after it had hit the food truck			1
the blaze was eventually extinguished and the vehicle was towed back into the centre of the show ring where it remained for the rest of the day			1
no - one was hurt in the incident yesterday and neither organisers of the show , held at @entity69 near @entity70 , @entity71 , nor @entity72 could be reached for a comment			1
the car was set on fire as part of a firefighting demonstration at the @entity8 and @entity9 but about 50 onlookers were shocked when they realised the demonstration had gone badly wrong a shocked onlooker said : ' the car fire display was one of the highlights of the demonstrations scheduled to take part in the main ring at the show			1
' there were about 50 people watching as a car was set well alight			1
a fire engine entered the ring and was doing laps of the burning car			1
' all of a sudden the car started moving forward			0
we all thought it was part of the demonstration so no - one really thought anything of it			2
' the fire engine stopped parading and the firefighters then started to try to put the fire out , but then the car started moving again			2
' it became clear that something had gone very wrong			2
there were gasps as the crowd began to realise what was happening			0
' firefighters and stewards then jumped in front of the car to try to stop it hitting a hot dog stand but they could n't			2
' smoke from the burning wreckage billows up into the sky as firefighters work to contain the blaze @entity123 , no - one was injured in the accident and the burnt out car was dragged back into the main ring the onlooker added : ' it kept going until it hit the food truck 's tow bar			1
the front wheels were still spinning so if it had n't hit the towbar it would have just kept going until it hit something else			0
' behind the food truck was the funfair full of families - it does n't bear thinking about what could have happened			2
' the commentator went silent and then started filling , trying to distract everyone 's attention from what had just happened			0
' once the fire had been put out it was then dragged back into the middle of the ring and all the other displays went on around it			0
' ' when everyone realised what was going on there was a real sense of panic			0
' it was pretty frightening seeing a ball of flames rolling towards a food truck that presumably has gas bottles inside			0
' it could have been an absolute disaster			0
' the firefighters looked pretty sheepish afterwards			0
it must have been something of an embarrassment for them - it certainly did n't paint them in the best light			0
' the car fire display took place at 12.45pm yesterday in front of a crowd of around 50 people			1
there were approximately 1,000 people inside the showground when the incident took place			0
the car fire demonstration scheduled to take place at the same time today was cancelled .			0
