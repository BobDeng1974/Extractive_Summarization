by @entity0 the growing use of the word ‘ fit ’ to describe attractiveness is putting girls off sport and exercise , according to a girls ’ school leader			1
children should stop using it to mean ‘ fanciable ’ because it can lead to girls feeling self - conscious about their appearance while exercising , says @entity13			1
girls should be able to get ‘ pink in the face and tousled ’ without worrying about whether they were having a ‘ bad hair day ’			1
attractive young schoolgirls should not be called ' fit ' to mean ' fanciable ' as it puts them off physical education , a girls ' education chief will say today ( library image ) mrs @entity13 , chief executive of the @entity24 ’ @entity22 ( @entity23 ) , believes girls should be concerned about their running speed instead of worrying ‘ does my bum look big in this ? ’			1
in a speech to the trust ’s annual conference today , mrs @entity13 will say : ‘ what on earth has happened to the word fit , which used to mean that you could run a few miles without collapsing but now just means “ fanciable ” ? ‘ i think sport and exercise is one of the ways in which women can reclaim their bodies from the kind of obsessions of the tabloid press and celebrity magazines			1
‘ it is not about being fat or thin , it is about being fit			0
it is not about how you look , but about what you do			0
’ she will add : ‘ really great inclusive sport takes girls away from all those unhelpful thoughts of bodily perfection and focuses them on the team and the goals			2
‘ i have been in our schools when a class of teenage girls is returning from a sports lesson , pink in the face , tousled , throwing themselves down on the floor – with never a moment of “ am i having a bad hair day ” , or “ does my bum look big in this ”			1
’ @entity13 will say girls should n't worry about ' getting pink in the face ' or if their ' bum looks big ' while exercising ( library image ) mrs @entity13 will also urge schools to impress upon girls the importance of sport ‘ more forcefully ’			1
by the age of eight or nine , girls are already less active than boys and by the time they are 14 , only 12 per cent of girls are as active as they should be			2
mrs @entity13 will highlight a lack of ‘ cultural representations of women and girls who are physically powerful , fast and strong ’			2
she will also criticise different treatment of the sexes in professional sport , with sponsorship and media attention skewed in favour of men			0
‘ women ’s football and women ’s cricket gets less funding , less media attention , ’ she says			0
‘ a @entity91 boss sends sexist emails			0
newspapers print allegations that @entity95 is fat ( that was before she won her gold medal ) , ’ she will say			0
she will point out that many successful women have a strong sporting past including @entity100 , head of the @entity102 , who was a member of the @entity105 national synchronised swimming team , and @entity106 , the former @entity108 secretary of state , who is an accomplished golfer			0
‘ it is important to have cultural representations of women and girls who are physically powerful , and fast and strong , ’ she says			0
the @entity23 – which runs 24 private and two state academies – has attempted to create a culture of ‘ sport for all ’ with classes in @entity115 and tai chi as well as traditional team games .			2

*ceo* of @entity23 says word makes *females* self - conscious
@entity13 said girls should n't worry about getting ' pink in the face '
