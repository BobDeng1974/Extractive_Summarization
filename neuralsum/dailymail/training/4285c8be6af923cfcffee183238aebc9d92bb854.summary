by @entity0 they are known as some of the wildest predators in the animal kingdom			1
but you would n't think it watching this video			1
in a bizarre clip that is both heart - warming and strange , five grey wolves kiss and cuddle a photographer - who is happy to join the pile of love			1
mr @entity16 is poised to take a picture but it seems he can not resist returning the sharp - fanged animals ' affection			1
alarmingly , in the @entity20 's description of the pack , they explain that they are ' very friendly ' to their prey - but sources insist this was a moment of genuine affection			1
' @entity45 do not growl or snarl at their prey , ' the guide explains , ' it would be like a human getting angry at an ice cream cone he or she was about to eat ! wolves who are hunting look very excited and happy , even “ friendly ”			1
' intrigued : the animals circle mr @entity16 , climbing over each other			1
instead of taking a photo he strokes them affectionate : standing on the lake - side green , he ruffles their furry coats as they get more excitable still snapping : inching back , mr @entity16 tries to capture the moment at @entity20 in @entity30 , @entity21 but the group catches him as he walks round and they tumble to the floor , licking and cuddling each other and the doting photographer grapples to cling on to his long lens camera whilst cuddling the friendly greys according to dna studies , the domestic dog and the grey wolf is almost identical			1
but their marginally different brain development speed is the thing that sets them apart			1
wolves start to mature about two weeks earlier than their notoriously friendly cousins - meaning they are quick to judge and make enemies			1
as a result , they are far from ideal pets			2
domestic dogs are said to originate from wolf cubs that were used as guards by humans over 40,000 years ago in southeast @entity86			2
since that time wolves have been domesticated and used have been used by humans for hunting and herding			2
there are around 400 modern breeds of domesticated dogs			2
but tumbling around on the floor , these animals show no sign of cunning			2
they climb on each other to lick his face and nuzzle his head			2
incredibly , the fearless animal lover kisses them back			0
eventually the group roll onto the floor , where the snuggling continues			0
mr @entity16 juggles the excitable hounds with his camera as he flounders underneath the doting pile			1
the scenes completely contradict normal behaviour for the carnivorous breed , which feeds off mammals			0
unlike their cousins - dogs - these animals are instinctively wild , with a strict code of conduct based on hierarchy within their pack			1
there is one line of rank for males and one for females			0
the alpha male and female lead their packs			0
second in command is the beta male or female			0
at the bottom is the omega wolf - a scapegoat			0
although there are leaders and weaklings , it is not always survival of the fittest			0
it is always the hungriest that gets to eat first , not necessarily the biggest			0
working together , they ensure each member has a role to play and none are neglected			0
contrary to popular belief , wild wolves are not dangerous			0
naturally afraid of humans , they scarper in an instant , making them ' safe '			0
however , domesticated wolves and hybrid breeds are notoriously violent as they have lost their fear .			0
