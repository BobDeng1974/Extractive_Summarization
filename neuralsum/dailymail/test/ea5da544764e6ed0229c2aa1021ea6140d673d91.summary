@entity0 backed @entity1 to hit the test century that has eluded him for 33 innings on thursday and put @entity4 in a winning position in the second test			1
@entity0 produced his best and quickest bowling since knee surgery last year to take three wickets for 19 here in @entity11 before a defiant last wicket stand of 52 from @entity13 and @entity14 lifted @entity15 to 299			1
then @entity1 , fighting for his captaincy in this series , and the under pressure @entity19 joined forces to hit their first half - century partnership as an opening pair and reach 74 without loss by the close of a rain - affected second day			1
@entity0 produced his best and quickest bowling since knee surgery last year on day two in @entity11 @entity26 took three wickets on day two as @entity4 bowled @entity15 out for 299 captain @entity1 , who won the toss and chose to bowl , worked his way to 37 not out at stumps @entity0 backs @entity1 to go onto a big hundred and get his side in a winning position with three days left when @entity1 reached 17 of his unbeaten 37 he went past @entity34 to become the second highest run - scorer in @entity4 's @entity37 history and now only his mentor in @entity39 stands ahead of him			1
' he 's been an amazing performer for eight or nine years now , ' said @entity0			2
' and he 's such a level headed character that you never know whether he 's got nought or 200 if you bumped into him in the evening			0
' @entity43 wo n't be thinking about personal landmarks now			0
he knows if he gets a big hundred tomorrow he will set his team up with a fantastic chance of getting a result and it was great to see @entity1 and @entity19 back together again			2
hopefully they can score a lot more runs tomorrow			0
' @entity0 revealed that a chat with new bowling coach @entity54 and a change of technique led him to add 10 miles per hour to his bowling overnight and look back to his best			2
@entity1 plays a shot to the legside as he found some form on a rain - interrupted day two at @entity61 's @entity0 celebrates the wicket of @entity15 captain @entity63 , who was caught behind on 31 ' i made a slight change overnight after watching quite a lot of footage of how i got my wickets and i was a bit wider on the crease which allowed my momentum to go straight through , ' said @entity0 , who touched 91 miles per hour when bowling a beauty to take @entity63 's wicket			1
' it seemed to work and i was really pleased with how i bowled today			0
' despite some momentum in the favour of @entity1 's side , @entity0 admits @entity4 are battling both the weather and an at time defiant @entity15 as they look to force victory			1
with unpredictable forecasts around , @entity0 knows only full days of cricket and a sizeable first - innings lead will leave the tourists on track			0
@entity0 celebrates after reaching 91 miles per hour for the delivery that took @entity63 's wicket @entity1 and @entity19 leave the field at stumps having guided @entity4 to 74 runs without loss ' the only way we can win is by getting 400 , 450 in the first innings and applying pressure that way , ' he said			1
' we need a bit of lady luck , blue skies in the morning and hopefully there 's not too much swing			0
' you ca n't have mornings like we 've had on every day of the test or it will be a draw			0
' but we 've got a pretty simple job from now , which is to bat a day and half to two days because i do n't think anyone really knows how this wicket will behave late on day three , four or five			0
