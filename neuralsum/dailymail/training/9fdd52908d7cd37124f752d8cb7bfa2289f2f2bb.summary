by @entity0 published : 18:37 est , 9 september 2012 updated : 02:43 est , 10 september 2012 businessman : @entity3 successful @entity2 has spent huge sums on the village in an attempt to turn it into a tourist destination for wealthy @entity8 but locals have started a rebellion walking around @entity12 , it is n’t hard to see why the fabulously wealthy @entity8 property expert @entity2 chose it as the place to buy a rural weekend retreat			1
the @entity18 beauty spot — population 750 , home to a pub and a 14th - century church built by the then @entity24 @entity23 , and with spectacular views over @entity26 — is a perfect example of a sedate @entity29 village			1
it is gloriously pretty , the lanes hemmed with pink and white wildflowers			2
and it hosts all manner of community events , including next month ’s harvest supper			2
best of all , it boasts some of the smiliest , most welcoming people you could ever meet			2
‘ we all say hello to one another around here , ’ beams @entity41 , 61 , a retired lumberjack who has lived in @entity12 all her life			2
‘ there is a real sense of community			2
it ’s friendly and peaceful			2
’ until now , that is			2
thanks to a flurry of digging and drilling , @entity12 is not feeling very peaceful or friendly at all			2
from the graveyard of @entity54 , the constant hum of machinery hangs in the air			0
the source is @entity2 ’s £ 3.5 million grade i - listed mansion next door			1
after a series of bizarre local developments pioneered by the 41 - year - old property tycoon , villagers are now fearing for the future of their idyll — and threatening @entity2 with an asbo if the noise does n’t stop			1
the saga began three years ago when @entity2 , who has a glamorous blonde wife , @entity71 , and four children , bought the house from retired businessman @entity74 , who ’d been there for 32 years			1
@entity75 , 78 , a retired pilot whose home is next to @entity2 ’s back garden , says : ‘ @entity74 did everything you ’d expect from a village squire			1
he went to parties , took part in local activities			2
he was part of the community			0
’ the villagers were initially intrigued by their new neighbour , and hoped he ’d pick up where @entity74 left off			0
all they knew was that @entity2 was the @entity90 vice-president of @entity91 , which handles some of the world ’s largest property deals , including @entity95 care homes and @entity97 holiday villages			1
troubled waters : a drained lake which @entity2 left standing empty after an infestation of fish lice and @entity2 's house behind the church generous : he is believed to have donated thousands towards a new organ for @entity12 church welcome to @entity12 : @entity75 has lived in the village for three decades @entity75 says : ‘ there was a feeling of goodwill — i had mr @entity2 round for drinks one evening			1
’ @entity2 won over villagers by donating £ 60,000 to the church organ fund			1
then 18 months ago he stepped in to buy the village pub , @entity115			2
they ’d discussed buying it themselves but were happy to make way for an experienced developer , who renamed it the three daggers and added a dining room and play area			0
‘ we could n’t have done what he did , ’ says @entity125 , 56 , a retired businessmen whose back garden overlooks @entity2 ’s property			1
‘ it ’s gone from traditional boozer to gastro - pub , but that ’s not necessarily a bad thing			2
’ and at first , the hammering and digging noises coming from @entity2 ’s house did n’t raise concern			1
@entity140 , 54 , a computer consultant , says : ‘ he was making modifications but everyone ’s allowed that , are n’t they ? we believed it was in good faith			0
’ @entity12 resident @entity75 stands in front of the large hedgerow which backs onto his house and was planted by neighbour @entity2 it was only when some inquisitive villagers looked on the internet to learn more about their new neighbour , that the tide started to turn			1
says @entity140 : ‘ we learnt that he is partnered with a holiday company called @entity158 , and he seemed to see the village as a tourist destination			1
’ the business , geared towards wealthy @entity8 , offers ‘ unique vacation experiences for those who prefer a little adventure with their luxury ’			1
it advertises beach holidays in the @entity168 , skiing trips to @entity170 and luxury chalets in the @entity172			0
now activity holidays in @entity18 have joined the list			1
one company video promises visitors the chance to hunt , shoot , fish and horse - ride in @entity12			2
a smart , young couple are seen zooming through woodland in a giant @entity183 and speeding off on motorbikes			0
@entity41 squeals : ‘ can you imagine ? we get plenty of walkers at the weekend , and they are welcome			0
they come for the peace and quiet and they do n’t cause a fuss			0
but now it is going to be a load of @entity8 , horse - riding and driving all over the place			1
’ the renovations of @entity2 ’s properties were soon seen as something more than modifications for him and his family			1
the first problem for villagers was his lake — thought to be a medieval carp lake fished in by @entity206 at the @entity207			0
@entity2 had to drain it following an infestation of fish lice , and now it stands empty — an ugly patch of grey it is to be refilled and restocked so visitors staying in two cottages on @entity2 ’s land can fish			1
the site also boasts a tennis court , swimming pool and brand new stable			0
‘ and he ’s moving in housekeeping staff , ’ says @entity41			0
‘ i mean , really ! ’ the three daggers — described on @entity158 ’s website as the perfect place for ‘ a proper sunday brunch ’ — is also viewed with new suspicion			0
@entity41 says : ‘ he ’s turned it into a place for yuppies			0
’ revamp : he has bought @entity115 pub in the village and turned it into the three daggers but locals do n't seem to like that either idyllic : @entity12 , @entity18 lies to the south east of @entity238 in @entity29 in most villages , disputes are usually settled over a chat over a garden wall			1
but the villagers have n’t had much luck in contacting mr @entity2			1
@entity140 says : ‘ he does n’t really live here , he lives in @entity246			0
what he ’s doing is a commercial development by stealth			0
' @entity2 ’s workers are ever - present			1
mr @entity75 recalls how three months ago he woke to find his garden hemmed in by a hedge of 3m - high yew trees			1
‘ there was no warning , ’ he says			0
it casts a shadow over his garden and runs along past the house where @entity41 lives with her partner @entity259			0
then the yews turn to beech at @entity125 ’s			0
‘ but this is where he made his mistake , ’ says mr @entity75			1
@entity265 are evergreen , and it is illegal to have an evergreen hedge that ’s more than 2m - tall			1
it violates part eight of the @entity269			0
’ @entity75 has now become the ring - leader of a local rebellion			1
‘ i told mr pike i was going to apply for an @entity272			0
he said : “ if you threaten me with an asbo you will be the laughing stock of the village			2
” ’ one neighbour said they moved to the village for peace and quiet but claims that he has been disturbed by ' constant ' noise from building work at @entity2 's home undettered , @entity75 has written to the council			1
but in the meantime , another of @entity2 ’s developments is causing bad feeling			1
next door to his pub , he is building the village ’s only shop , selling fruit and vegetables grown in his garden and other local products			2
currently it is little more than a frame surrounded by huge cranes but villagers are scathing of the ‘ gourmet boutique ’			0
mr @entity75 says : ‘ people around here do n’t buy that sort of food			1
he is trying to run @entity305 in @entity12			0
’ mr @entity2 has also attracted ridicule for installing a space - age security system around his property			1
to get to the house , you must first press a buzzer on a keypad			0
two security cameras then whirr into action and a robotic @entity8 voice says : ‘ please wait while your call is connected			1
’ the ‘ call ’ is answered by a member of staff			0
it ’s not the sort of welcome @entity322 are used to			0
locals fear @entity324 will turn the village into a ' theme park ' as he has bought several homes there and advertised it as a holiday destination on a website with pictures of various local activities @entity41 is also unhappy about a footpath she uses to walk her @entity335 , @entity336			1
it crosses mr @entity2 ’s land , where she says a new sign has been erected ordering dog - walkers to put their animal on a leash			1
‘ it ’s made holly depressed , ’ she says			0
understandably , the furore is said to have upset the @entity345			0
their investment manager @entity346 says : ‘ they ’re devastated			0
they ’re investing because they want to use the house			0
as far as they ’re concerned , they had gone through the proper channels			0
‘ they are providing jobs to local traders and businesses			2
’ mr @entity2 has spent much of the summer abroad , and has refrained from commenting on the unrest			2
no doubt he has the best of intentions in his development of @entity12 — but if he is planning to open up the village to the world , his guests might be a little disappointed			0
because @entity2 ’s neighbours show no sign of backing down or of extending their usually warm welcome to any of his visitors			2
which would be a terrible shame , because as @entity41 puts it : ‘ without experiencing the people , they wo n’t really be experiencing @entity12 at all			0

property expert @entity2 bought £ 3.5m grade i - listed mansion in @entity18 three years ago
@entity377 discovered @entity2 saw beauty spot as tourist destination for wealthy @entity8
@entity75 , ring - leader of local rebellion , threatened @entity8 with an asbo for growing an evergreen hedge more than 2m - tall
