nearly 50,000 @entity1 and @entity2 applied to work in @entity3 in the first three months of this year , dramatic new official figures showed yesterday			1
a total of 34,904 @entity1 and 10,445 @entity2 registered for @entity6 numbers in january , february and march – the first three months after the lifting of employment restrictions on migrant workers from the two countries			1
the new statistics severely undermine claims made last week that the number of @entity1 and @entity2 workers in the country actually fell in the first months of this year			1
among the first to arrive earlier this year was @entity1 @entity17			2
landing at @entity18 on @entity19 , he was greeted by @entity21 mp @entity20 , chairman of the @entity23 home affairs committee in the run - up to the @entity27 elections , the @entity24 claimed there were 4,000 fewer @entity1 and @entity2 workers in @entity3 in march than in january , and its political editor scoffed : ‘ so much for those predictions of a flood of immigrants coming from @entity1 and @entity2 once the door to the @entity3 was opened			1
’ however the evidence used by the @entity24 and others was drawn from @entity37 ( @entity37 ) surveys widely regarded as being flawed			0
the national insurance number record – which provides an accurate count of exactly who has applied to work in this country – told an entirely different story when published yesterday , the day of the elections			0
in the year to march , 46,890 @entity1 applied for the @entity6 qualification , up by 163 per cent on the 17,820 who applied in the previous 12 months			1
@entity2 applications went up by 71 per cent over the 12 months to 17,750			2
national insurance registrations by @entity1 in the first three months of this year are nearly double those for the whole of 2013			2
the @entity37 said 30 per cent of those registering in 2014 had been in @entity3 for more than a year and 22 per cent had registered within three months of arriving in @entity3			1
in the year to march , 46,890 @entity1 applied for the @entity6 qualification , up by 163 per cent on the 17,820 who applied in the previous 12 months ‘ this indicates that the january to march registration figures are actually reflecting migration over an extended period , ’ it said			1
however it may also indicate that @entity1 and @entity2 who had been working illegally in @entity3 seized the chance to become lawfully employed in january			1
the @entity59 think - tank , which projected that 50,000 @entity1 and @entity2 would arrive each year now that their citizens were free to work in this country , said the @entity6 figures backed up its analysis			1
the @entity37 figures claimed that a total of 140,000 people born in @entity1 and @entity2 were employed in @entity3 in the first three months of the year and @entity67 chief secretary to the treasury , @entity68 , said its findings ‘ give the lie to @entity71 ’s scaremongering on immigration ’			1
however , the @entity6 figures show that between the spring of 2002 and the spring of 2014 , there were nearly 300,000 numbers issued to citizens of @entity1 and @entity2			1
overall , the immigration statistics yesterday said that net immigration – the number by which immigration swelled the population after emigration has been taken into account – was 212,000 last year			2
this is double the 1990s levels that @entity85 is pledged to reach by the time of the election next year			0
among the first to arrive when controls on migrants from the two impoverished countries lapsed earlier this year was @entity1 @entity17			2
landing at @entity18 on @entity19 , he was greeted by @entity21 mp @entity20 , the chairman of the @entity23 home affairs committee			0
mr @entity17 , 30 , told reporters : ‘ i do n’t come to rob your country			0
i come to work and then go home			0
’ days after arriving , he found work with a team of fellow @entity98 washing cars at a supermarket in the @entity102 town of @entity103 – but he lasted only one day before disappearing			0
immigration minister @entity104 said : ‘ while recent net migration levels remain stable , the figures show that it has fallen by a third since its peak in 2005 under the last government and that this government ’s reforms have cut net migration from outside the @entity113 to levels not seen since the late 1990s			0
‘ we are focusing on cutting out the abuse of free movement between @entity113 member states and addressing the factors that drive @entity27 immigration to @entity3			0
’ but @entity71 leader @entity121 said : ‘ @entity85 has broken his solemn promise to the @entity3 people on one of the most important political issues			0
and he has done so because he refuses to take back control of our borders in respect of more than 400 million people from more than two dozen countries on continental @entity27			0
’ shadow home secretary @entity131 said : ‘ @entity85 and @entity132 promised “ no ifs , no buts ” to get their net migration target down to the tens of thousands by the end of the @entity139 , and the actual figure is over twice that			0
