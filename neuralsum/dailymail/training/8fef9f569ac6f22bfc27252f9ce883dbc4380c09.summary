by @entity1 reporter @entity2 : 09:32 est , 31 december 2013 @entity3 : 09:46 est , 31 december 2013 @entity4 needs to seriously start worrying about how it educates its young judging by some of the tweets that have been flying around the twitter - verse in recent days			2
for some ill - informed souls it appears tuesday night will usher in a lot more than just another year and is also the time when @entity4 will celebrate the 2,014th birthday of this great nation			1
seriously ? well sarcasm is n’t a form of humor that works well over 140 characters so it is hard to distinguish between those that think they ’re being super funny and those who clearly did n’t pay much attention in history class			0
revelers stand in @entity28 during last year 's @entity30 celebrations : some ill - informed souls believe that the @entity4 was formed 2014 years ago , and that @entity32 is @entity4 's birthday some even more deluded souls have been tweeting that in fact it ’s the earth celebrating its 2,014th birthday when the clock strikes 12 on tuesday night and that great big glittery ball in @entity28 drops			1
if some of these people are serious with their belief that the @entity4 was formed 2014 years ago , and that @entity32 is @entity4 's birthday , it begs the question that what exactly do they think july 4 is all about ? this guy raises a good point ... it 's not @entity4 celebrating , it 's the earth			0
doh ! some people are a bit more confused than others ... for other @entity56 users the joke is starting to wear a bit thin ... confetti will fly over @entity59 's @entity28 after the clock strikes midnight during @entity30 celebrations , just do n't go thinking that means @entity4 has turned 2014			0

some ill - informed souls believe @entity30 ushers in the moment when @entity4 start celebrating the 2,014th birthday of this great nation
