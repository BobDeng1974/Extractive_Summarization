cybersecurity researchers have warned that a bug in @entity4 's @entity3 operating system makes most iphones and @entity6 vulnerable to cyberattacks			2
cybersecurity firm @entity8 says the bug enables hackers to access their devices by persuading users toinstall malicious applications with tainted text messages , emails and web links			1
the malicious application can then be used to replace genuine , trusted apps that were installed through @entity4 's @entity18 , including email and banking programs , with malicious software through a technique that @entity8 has dubbed ' @entity23			1
' attacks can be used to steal banking and email login credentials or other sensitive data , according to @entity8 @entity8 says there are three rules to follow : do n't install apps from third - party sources other than @entity4 's official @entity18 or the user 's own organization do n't click ' install ' on a pop - up from a third - party web page , no matter what the pop - up says about the app. when opening an app , if @entity3 shows an alert with ' @entity42 ' , as shown in @entity43 , click on ' @entity44 ' and uninstall the app immediately these attacks can be used to steal banking and email login credentials or other sensitive data , according to @entity8 , which is well - regarded in cybersecurity circles for its research			1
' it is a very powerful vulnerability and it is easy to exploit , ' @entity8 senior staff research scientist @entity51 said in an interview			2
officials with @entity4 could not be reached for comment			2
@entity51 said that @entity8 disclosed the vulnerability to @entity4 in july and that representatives with the company have said they were working to fix the bug			2
news of the vulnerability began to leak out in october on specialized web forums where security experts and hackers alike discuss information on @entity4 bugs , @entity51 said			0
@entity51 said that @entity8 decided to go public with its findings after @entity70 last week uncovered the first campaign to exploit the vulnerability , a new family of malicious software known as @entity75 that infects both @entity77 computers and @entity3			1
@entity8 does not know of other attacks that exploit the bug , @entity51 said			0
' currently @entity75 is the only one , but we will see more , ' he said			0
@entity8 advises @entity3 users to refrain from install apps from sources other than @entity4 's official @entity18 and to not click ' install ' on a pop - up from a third - party web page			1
the security firm said it verified this vulnerability on @entity90 , 7.1.2 , 8.0 , 8.1 and 8.1.1 beta , for both jailbroken and non-jailbroken devices			0
the firm used the explouit to replace @entity97 's @entity96 app with a rogue version			1
' in one of our experiments , we used an in - house app with a bundle identifier ' @entity104 ' with a title ' @entity106 '			0
' we signed this app using an enterprise certificate			0
' when we installed this app from a website , it replaced the original @entity96 app on the phone			0
' last week researchers warned of a major threat called @entity75			0
@entity75 monitors @entity3 devices , including ipods , iphones and @entity6 , connected to a @entity77 via usb			0
the virus begins by infecting the @entity122 software , through malicious files or links			1
when a device is connected to this infected @entity77 , the malware automatically installs malicious apps onto the phone or tablet			1
the researchers said this malware combines a number of techniques to successfully ' realise a new brand of threat to all @entity3 devices '			0
the experts suggest @entity3 and @entity77 owners only download apps from the official @entity4 app store , and that they make sure to keep their software up to date .			1

' *masque* attack ' can replace real apps with malicious version that *siphon* off data
can only be loaded if users *choose* to install from outside @entity18
