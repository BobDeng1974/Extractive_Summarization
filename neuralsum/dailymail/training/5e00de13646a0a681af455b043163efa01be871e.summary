it is an engine whose distinctive roar can make the heart leap			1
the successor of the great @entity7 engine , the @entity4 also played its part in helping to win the @entity9 when it was fitted to iconic warbirds such as the @entity11			1
now three excellent examples of the type are set to go under the hammer and sell for thousands of pounds			2
piston power : auction house worker @entity16 is pictured with the three griffon engines which provided the power for @entity20 planes such as the @entity11 towards the end of the @entity9 and beyond things of beauty : two of the giant @entity4 engines that will sold at auction			1
the type propelled later model spitfires in the @entity9 the three 36.7 litre @entity29 engines were used in @entity11 and the four - engined post-war @entity31 - and are examples of the advanced technology which helped achieve superiority over the @entity35			1
today just one @entity31 and fewer than 60 @entity11 originally fitted with one of these engines are still flying anywhere in the world			1
iconic : the positioning of the 12 pistons in a ' v ' - shape gives the @entity4 engine its distinctive shape and the majority of the left - over engines were disposed of after the @entity9 - some even tipped down a mine shaft just to get rid of them			2
the mammoth engines were discovered in a barn in @entity52 during a house call to see furniture and ‘ some stuff in the shed ’ and are expected to make more than £ 10,000 each			0
@entity57 @entity56 said : ' these extremely rare pieces of @entity20 history have been saved from destruction for more than 30 years			0
maritime reconnaissance : the @entity4 engines powered the @entity31 , a post-war @entity64 aircraft used for sea patrols @entity67 's favourite : a @entity11 , they type which was eventually fitted with superior @entity4 engines the @entity4 was the last in the line of @entity29 aero engines to be produced by @entity72 with production ceasing in 1955			1
griffon engines remain in @entity76 service today with the @entity77 and also power the last remaining airworthy @entity31 - which flies in @entity79			1
in line with @entity72 convention the @entity4 was named after a bird of prey , in this case the @entity83 and was commissioned by the @entity84 as a larger , more powerful version of the @entity7 engine for use in naval aircraft			2
although the @entity4 was designed for naval aircraft , on 8 november 1939 n. @entity89 of the @entity90 suggested fitting the @entity4 in a @entity11 and this was achieved in 1941			1
@entity95 's were the first recipient of the @entity4 , a number of subsequent spitfires retained @entity7 power but towards the end of spitfire production all were powered by @entity100			2
towards the end of the war @entity64 found a need for a new land - based @entity104 culminating in @entity106 / 46 , which became the @entity31 , a descendant of the @entity108 and @entity109 bombers , with four @entity4 engines			1
the @entity31 first flew in 1949 and the @entity111 , with uprated @entity113 engines entered service with @entity115			1
production of the @entity4 ceased in 1955 a total of 8,108 being built			0
' they were part of a collection belonging to @entity121 who has dedicated his life to the preservation and conservation of @entity125			0
' he had rescued these engines which he thought were of little worth as well as saving the original patterns for the legendary @entity7 engine from a skip			2
' while serving with the @entity76 he was involved in the making of the @entity133 movie , and almost every @entity11 still flying today owes something to his expertise - he is a real unsung hero of @entity20 military aviation history			1
' the sale will also include his extensive collection of aircraft parts including propellers , an anti-gravity test rig and a @entity11 gun camera			1
' it ’s one of the most unusual and exciting sales we have ever handled and has already attracted worldwide interest			0
' it ’s something we have never dealt with before and even more unusual as we only went to see the furniture in his house and shed and came across these two and a half tonne nine foot giants			0
' other items that will excite aviation fans include a @entity155 injection carburetor which was part of a @entity157 engine			2
the lots also include pistons believed to have come from a @entity7 engine as well as 13 magneto generators that date from both world wars and some from the present day			0
the three identical engines are @entity164			0
the 36.7 litre supercharged engines are capable of producing 1,960 horse power and are liquid - cooled			1
one has no flying hours left and was removed from @entity169 maritime patrol aircraft @entity170 1980			0
another has 62 flying hours remaining and was removed from @entity169 maritime patrol aircraft @entity173 1980			0
both are mounted on wooden stands and are dated approximately 1952			0
the collection will form part of @entity57 mammoth four - day @entity178 , @entity179 from 26 - 29 june			0
remarkable find : the engines are in reasonable conditions despite being stored in a barn for 30 years mark of quality : the @entity72 branding on the engine casing			0
the company 's factory produced more than 8,000 of the type a piece of history : this label shows the engines were removed by a sergeant @entity195 at @entity196 in @entity197 and give safety notes about the coolant system , fuel injectors and piston cylinders			0

36.7 litre @entity204 engine was the power behind later examples of the @entity11 and the @entity31
these examples were removed from a @entity31 in the early 1950s
