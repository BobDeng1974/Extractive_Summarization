in style : when @entity3 's wife @entity2 , emerged from the crystal clear @entity5 waters this week , she was wearing a long - sleeved , ' rash vest ' beachwear that banishes bingo wings , sucks in middle - age spread like super-strength @entity11 and protects a delicate decolletage from the ageing rays of the sun sounds like the answer to every woman over 40 ’s prayers			1
but while it may also sound a little too good to be true , when @entity3 ’s wife @entity2 , emerged from the crystal clear @entity5 waters this week , she was wearing one of these magic garments — a long - sleeved , patterned ‘ rash vest ’			1
these vests , also known as ‘ rashies ’ , were originally invented in the @entity25 to stop surfers chafing their skin on their surfboards , but have recently become a must - have on the beach for women who want to protect their skin from the sun , while also covering their wobbly bits			1
the vests , which are usually made out of @entity34 , nylon or polyester , are proving incredibly popular with celebrities of a certain age , with actresses @entity39 , @entity41 and @entity42 , @entity43 and supermodel @entity44 all pictured in them on the beach			1
i ’m thrilled that the a-list are finally following my lead , for i ’ve been sporting rash vests for almost 20 years — and getting odd looks from strangers on the beach for decades as a result			1
as an @entity52 , i ’ll do anything to protect my skin , but still love to be in the sunshine			1
my @entity57 friends , as they lie on the beach in blazing heat with just factor 10 on , laugh at me sitting under an umbrella in my factor 50 , hat and obligatory rashie			0
i ’ll have the last laugh , though			0
for nothing — not divorce , depression , recession — destroys a woman ’s looks more than the sun. it is our worst enemy , yet few born in these milder climes seem to really understand the damage it does , even in short bursts			0
it 's a cover up : @entity39 ( left ) hardly braves the beach without one and proves modesty can be sexy , while @entity41 ( right ) was pictured in 2007 , aged 43 , in a baggy rashie with nothing underneath surf chic : sporty supermodel @entity44 , a fellow @entity52 and a big fan of rashies , takes full advantage of one of their perks - they enable you to stay warm in the water for hours for proof of this look no further than @entity2 , who at 53 has the smooth skin tone of a woman half her age			1
and now her secret is out			0
she ’s a sun - shunner			1
while many women delude themselves that slathering on a bit of factor 20 will protect their pale skin from the sun while splashing around in the waves , @entity2 obviously knows better			1
whether on holiday each summer at @entity111 , on the south - west coast of @entity52 , or in the @entity107 , or even in the chilly sea off @entity109 , i would n’t get into the water without a rashie			1
all white : @entity43 ( left ) stepped out on the beach in @entity116 in 2012 wearing far more clothes than she ever does on stage , and @entity42 ( right ) has also been photographed wearing a rashie while enjoying the sun in fact , i would n’t get out in the full holiday sun for more than 10 minutes without my rashie			1
unsurprisingly , with its searing heat and ozone holes that make the sun especially fierce , rash vests were invented in @entity52 , where they have been popular for years			1
and the @entity52 , with their love of anything that ends in a rising inflection and an ‘ eee ’ , dubbed them rashies			0
( they make great pressies at @entity136 for the relies — or great presents at @entity138 for the relatives )			0
now they ’re used for sun protection in water sports such as windsurfing and canoeing , or just having fun in the waves			2
not sloshing your child in factor 50 and wriggling them into a rashie before they hit the beach is akin to child abuse there			2
in the @entity25 they only came in @entity34 , made as they were for super-fit surfers with washboard stomachs , but now you can get them in slimming @entity34 ( yes ! )			1
they usually provide a sun protection factor of 50 + , which prevents burning , plus uv filters , to stop the ultra-violet rays that cause ageing and dna damage			1
you can even buy them with factor 100			0
@entity169 , even for me			0
no longer built for boys , they ’ve become more stylish , in patterns and bright block colours , and are cut in a way which is more flattering to a woman ’s figure			0
and it ’s not just because they protect you from the sun that we @entity52 — and the a-list — wear them			1
for a good rashie can be a woman ’s best friend			0
i swear they can take a stone off you , in all the right places			0
the good ones suck you in like a corset			0
middle - aged tummy disappears and , worn over a good swimsuit with a bit of support in the bra , they turn a tubby torso into @entity201 curves			2
is it any wonder middle - aged women love them ? as well as hiding those giveaways of middle - age — untoned upper arms and a thickening waist — rashies also prevent other signs of ageing			2
they protect the areas most vulnerable to sun damage – the neck , décolletage and , in some versions , hands			1
the skin is so thin there , it ’s the first to wrinkle and get covered in horrible sun spots , which are all too often early signs of skin cancers			2
and those parts really show a woman ’s age			0
once you ’ve fried them in oil in the sun for years , they never recover			2
that ’s why rashies need to be almost up to your chin and reach your fingertips , as perfectly demonstrated by @entity43 , who stepped out on the beach in @entity116 in 2012 wearing far more clothes than she ever does on stage			1
at 53 she was covered by a white rashie , matching trousers and a baseball cap — in stark contrast to the topless toyboy she was with			0
she also got it right by wearing a bosom - supporting swimsuit underneath , which completes the hourglass look — unlike @entity41 , who was pictured in 2007 , aged 43 , in a baggy rashie with nothing underneath , looking like she was breast - feeding quadruplets			2
fair - skinned @entity39 hardly braves the beach without one , and proves that modesty is every bit as sexy as flashing the @entity255 does n’t need any help tucking in that tummy , so often opts for a light - weight fabric and sporty style , paired with sleek bikini bottoms			1
sporty supermodel @entity44 , a fellow @entity52 and a big fan of rashies , takes full advantage of one of their perks — they enable you to stay warm in the water for hours			0
they act like a wetsuit and trap a thin layer of warm air between your body and the rashie , keeping out the cold and enabling keen surfers like @entity277 to stay in the waves as long as they like			1
and think of all the extra exercise you can get surfing and swimming while your bikini - clad sisters are fleeing the water after ten minutes with goose bumps to bake themselves old and wrinkled in the sunshine			2
but while these celebrities might make rashies look chic , they are n’t for the faint - hearted			2
getting into — and out of — them is pure pantomime , like trying to squeeze into a surgical glove			0
for the most flattering look they have to be skin tight , which means dragging it over your head , wriggling your arms down the slim tubes of sleeves , hoiking it up under your arms then stretching it down over a tummy that ’s usually overindulged on holiday			0
i have to admit getting out of it is n’t a ladylike process , either			0
i usually get stuck half - way through , have to cry to my boyfriend for help , then adopt the half - brace position as he peels it off , along with a cascade of wet sand			0
yet , despite these indignities , ladies of a certain age should bear in mind that there is nothing like a rashie to take inches off the waist and years off the decolletage — just remember to pack a man with a sense of humour to peel you out of it .			0
