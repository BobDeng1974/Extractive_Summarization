a report suggests that carbon dioxide produced by burning fossil fuels could be captured and used to produce the fizz in @entity4 we may be told that fizzy drinks are n’t good for our health , but there 's a chance that they could be beneficial to the planet			1
an @entity14 government report suggests that carbon dioxide produced by burning fossil fuels could be captured and used to produce the fizz in @entity4			1
many nations are looking into @entity18 ( @entity18 ) technologies as a way to cut their greenhouse house emissions , of which carbon dioxide plays a large role			1
@entity18 refers to the process of capturing carbon released by burning fossil fuels and storing it in porous rock layers in areas such as depleted oil and gas reservoirs			1
the technology has the potential to reduce the emissions of a typical coal - power plant by up to 90 per cent , but there are concerns over storing such huge amounts of carbon underground			2
the government ’s @entity40 has an idea of how to overcome this			0
after noting that industrial processes , which rely on the combustion of fossil fuels , are responsible for a significant proportion of @entity14 ’s carbon dioxide emissions , it says : ‘ if the co2 can be captured before it is released to the atmosphere it can either be utilised in other products or permanently stored in deep geological formations			1
‘ @entity14 has worked closely with other countries which rely heavily on fossil fuels to investigate opportunities to utilise co2 in products such as carbonated drinks and plastics or to enhance the growth of oil - rich algae in solar bioreactors to produce biofuel			1
’ this implies that as well as investigating the production of biofuels , carbon dioxide could be stashed in fizzy drinks			1
however , the report goes on to note that : ‘ while these processes are promising , there is no commercial @entity57 re-use in @entity14 , largely reflecting the high cost of capturing the co2 from a flue gas stream			1
’ of course , cans of fizzy drinks emit gas when they are opened , as shown by the sharp hissing noise , and there is no mention of how this gas could be captured too			1
the @entity84 obtained consumption data from the @entity86 that suggest 944 million litres of fizzy drinks are consumed in @entity14 in a year			1
it ’s previously been calculated that there are 2.2 grams of carbon dioxide in a typical can of @entity4 , which means that just over 2,000 tonnes of carbon emissions could be saved if the gas was captured in cans – and not released again			1
it 's estimated that 3,299 tonnes of carbon dioxide are released every day from people drinking @entity4 alone , according to an article in the @entity99 so if the gas came from a recycled source , it could play a small role in helping the environment			1
last april , an @entity106 report highlighted a number of barriers to using @entity18 , including fatal co2 leaks , transport issues and operational risks , such as seismic tremors			2
but geologists came to the defence of the controvertial method of mitigating global warming			0
the report said : ‘ barriers to large ‐ scale deployment of @entity18 technologies include concerns about the operational safety and long ‐ term integrity of co2 storage as well as transport risks			1
’ but @entity126 , a professor of @entity18 at @entity127 , told @entity128 that with regard to carbon capture , the @entity106 report was ' inherently conservative ' and ' outdated			2
' although there are concerns about burying billions of tonnes of @entity57 underground , engineers have been doing something similar for decades			0
since the 1930s , the oil and gas industry has been injecting various fluids underground , and since then , researchers have been attempting to understand the risks this poses to human safety			0
last april , an @entity106 report highlighted a number of barriers to using @entity18 , including fatal co2 leaks , transport issues and operational risks , such as seismic tremors			2
a @entity18 storage facility in @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 , is pictured one of the main concerns over @entity18 is the pressure that it can exert on the porous rock deep underground			0
‘ it ’s like putting more air into your car tyre , ’ explained professor @entity126			0
‘ because you ’ve got a volume of air in there already , when you increase pressure you can crack rock			0
’ but he added that the oil and gas industry has the technologies to monitor this pressure and prevent subsurface cracks from appearing			0
‘ the other type of risk is there are geological faults underground , and if you increase the pressure , then that can lubricate that fault and create a small tremor on it , ’ said professor @entity126			0
‘ that has n’t happened with carbon dioxide disposal , but it has happened with dams on a tiny scale			2
’ if a tremor is large enough , it could cause @entity57 to leak back to the surface and into the atmosphere			0
this would be a hazard because co2 at high concentrations is an asphyxiant and fatal to humans			0
in 2010 , a study by @entity196 found that leaks from carbon dioxide injected deep underground could bubble up into drinking water aquifers near the surface , driving up levels of contaminants in the water ten-fold			2
professor @entity126 , however , said their more recent studies have placed the risk level to humans dying from a @entity18 leak at one in 30 million			0
last year , the @entity212 government said it will fund a multi-million pound project to design a carbon capture and storage plant at the @entity216 power station in @entity217			0
meanwhile the @entity218 has 19 large - scale @entity18 projects in operation or in various stages of development – the greatest amount for any country .			0

@entity14 report suggests ways carbon dioxide could be captured
includes mention of gas from fossil fuels being used to make fizzy drinks
other ideas include typical @entity18 and biofuels
