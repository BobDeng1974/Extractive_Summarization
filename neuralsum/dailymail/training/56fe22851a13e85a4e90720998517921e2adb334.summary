@entity0 has launched an investigation into solar panels at dozens of schools and businesses after a series of mystery fires			1
some 92 schools that signed up for free panels have been told their equipment will need improvements before it is considered safe to use			1
it comes after solar panel fires in three schools were confirmed by @entity0 following a tip - off to @entity17			2
a third roof blaze damaged two classrooms at @entity20 in @entity21 ( above ) although an investigation after the first two was ruled ' inconclusive ' , it is believed the energy giant was forced to carry out improvements when a third roof blaze damaged two classrooms at @entity20 in @entity21			1
more than 90 schools and 27 business fitted with the suspect equipment have been left without free solar energy since april			1
the news is likely to come as a blow to energy minister @entity33 , who the same month unveiled plans to put solar panels on the roofs of 24,000 schools			2
@entity0 has stressed that 160 other schools fitted with earlier versions of the panels are unaffected and that household ones are safe			1
a spokesman for @entity43 said the panels had been installed as part of @entity0 's @entity46 , which gives schools free equipment in return for a government green subsidy payment			1
a @entity0 spokesman would not reveal the cost of the shutdown , although sources say it could run ' well into six figures ' once compensation – for the extra cost of mains electricity – is included			2
@entity59 , managing director of @entity60 , said : ' safety is our number one priority			0
following an incident in april , we decided to turn off solar panels at certain non-domestic sites as a precaution while we undertook a full investigation			0
@entity0 has stressed that 160 other schools fitted with earlier versions of the panels are unaffected and that household ones are safe ( file photo ) no one was hurt and we have worked with independent experts to establish the cause			1
' as a further precautionary step , we are upgrading part of the solar installations at these sites			0
' professor @entity80 , director of @entity82 's @entity81 , said panel fires were unusual			0
he added : ' the cause here may lie in wiring or junction boxes , where power is converted for the grid , rather than the panels themselves			0
' there 's an argument that the @entity94 ( @entity94 ) needs to look at this			0
we must make sure there 's adequate testing of components and sufficient protection for buyers			0
' a spokesman for the @entity94 said : ' as legal action is pending , it would not be appropriate to comment			0
