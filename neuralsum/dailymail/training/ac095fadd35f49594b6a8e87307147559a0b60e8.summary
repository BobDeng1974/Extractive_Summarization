most @entity1 fans know their favourite secret agent as suave and sexy , with a naughty glint in his eye			2
@entity6 readers , however , believe 007 is far more conservative			1
fifty years after the first book was published , @entity6 are still reading heavily censored versions , with suggestive words including ' virgin ' and ' breast ' deleted from the text			1
too racy : @entity13 in the 1965 film version of @entity15 with dark - haired beauty @entity16 body of the text : @entity20 in dr no , 1963 , which also starred @entity13			1
@entity6 readers might not recognise the tale , however , because the last two pages of the book were cut @entity27 academic dr @entity26 , who discovered that the censored versions are still being reproduced , said the news was ' disconcerting and difficult to explain '			1
strict censors in @entity30 originally cut passages from @entity33 's books before allowing them to be published while the country was under dictator @entity36 's rule in the 1940			1
@entity15 ( 1974 ) these ' poor erotic descriptions ' were cut : the mounded v of the bikini looked up at @entity1 and the proud breasts in the tight cups were two more eyes			1
she kept her arms round his neck while he undid the single button of the brassiere and then the tapes of the taut slip			2
he stepped out of his bathing trunks and kicked them away			2
the general impression , @entity1 decided , was of a willful , high - tempered , sensual girl — a beautiful @entity56 mare who would only allow herself to be ridden by a horseman with steel tights and velvet hands , and then only with curb and saw - bite – and then only when he had broken her to bridle and saddle			2
he bent down and hooked his fingers in the neckline of her shirt and the join of the brassiere			2
very slowly , but with great force , he tore downwards , the whole length of her			2
then he threw aside the torn halves of material and exposed the whole gleaming length of her body			2
his right hand held the memory of a beautiful breast			2
@entity81 no ( 1960/74 ) these passages were cut : ' you do n't have to make love to me … we could go to sleep back to front , you know , like spoons			1
' ' you 're a wonderful girl			2
i thought so directly i saw you			2
'' saw my behind , you mean			2
' the voice was getting drowsy , but it was full of pleasure			2
' well , it was a wonderful behind			0
and the other side was wonderful too			0
' she stepped down into the bath and lay at full length			0
the fair hair on her body glittered up through the water like golden sovereigns			0
she said provocatively , ' you 've got to wash me			0
i do n't know what to do			0
' ' why do n't you like playing ? i want to play at being married			0
' @entity1 bent his head down into the warm soft hand and bit softly into the swelling			0
he felt her other hand in his hair			0
she gave a little scream and wrenched his head away by the hair			0
she undid her blouse and threw it on the floor			0
she undid his shirt and slowly , carefully took it off			0
the girl let go his hand and climbed into the sleeping - bag			0
she looked up at him			0
she said , practically , ' it 's a double one			1
it cost a lot of money			0
take those off and come in			0
you owe me slave - time			0
' the behind was almost as firm and rounded as a boy 's			1
the muscles of her behind bunched with tension			0
@entity1 could feel the hairs on his leg being parted			0
[ the word ‘ hairs ’ was censored in this particularly bizarre example			0
] even today , almost all the books remain censored and in some , entire chapters are omitted			0
dr @entity26 , a lecturer in hispanic studies , said @entity6 did not want the books published at all			1
' during @entity36 ’s regime , foreign ideas were perceived as a potential threat to the moral and social fabric of the country , ' he said			1
' the regime promoted the very @entity153 nature of @entity6 and censored literature that was at odds with this or with its political stance			1
@entity33 ’s novels were fairly sexually explicit and salacious for that era			0
' attempts to publish the novel were met with fierce opposition by the @entity6 censors			1
' dr @entity26 originally set out to research censorship during @entity36 's regime , and was surprised to see that the discrepancies between the @entity168 and @entity6 versions of sixth @entity1 novel dr no still existed			1
he went on to find that many edited versions of translated novels in the country are still being republished and read in @entity6 today			1
' a translation of dr no presented in 1960 was rejected outright by the censors , ' he said			1
' five years later , they forced substantial cuts on the editor			0
' the last two pages of the novel were deemed to be pornographic and completely excised			1
as a consequence the ending feels rushed and makes little sense			0
' the effects of censorship on this text , however , did not end with the regime ’s collapse , since expurgated versions of dr no were reprinted in 1996 , 2001 and 2011			1
dr @entity26 is now keen to explore why the advent of democracy did not stop the production , circulation and consumption of censored books			1
he said : ' it is a well known fact that @entity6 have found it difficult to come to terms with and confront their problematic recent history			1
' the so - called ‘ pact of forgetting ’ , a conscious decision not to question or examine the past in order to facilitate the transition to democracy , has prevented readers , libraries and publishing companies from developing strategies to address this issue			0
some books have been retranslated or restored , but as a result of the general amnesia surrounding the regime ’s cultural policies , these efforts have passed largely unnoticed , to the point that @entity6 public libraries , unaware of the problem , still promote the reading of censored materials			1
' ' i want to see this issue raised and discussed more widely in @entity6 so that readers in @entity6 can have access to re-translated or restored books			1
' @entity33 's novels are not the only @entity168 - language classics that have remained edited or unavailable in @entity6			1
other examples include @entity231 ’s @entity230 , @entity233 ’s @entity232 , @entity235 ’s @entity234 , @entity237 's @entity236 and @entity239 ’s @entity238 .			1

censorship began during @entity36 's regime
many @entity6 unaware they are not reading original text
last two pages of dr no were deemed pornographic and *competlely* cut
