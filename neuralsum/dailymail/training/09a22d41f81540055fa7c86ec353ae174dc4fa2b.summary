a fist - pumping run down the line , a win and a red card			1
life is rarely dull for @entity4 and his start to life as a manager in @entity8 was no different			1
he waited six months for this chance , first eyeing a position in the @entity11 and then , in time , @entity12 and @entity13			0
some of his calls were ignored , a few were answered			0
ultimately , no - one seemed to want a man who led @entity18 to a win over @entity20			0
so here is at @entity22			1
they were bottom of the championship going into this one ; they finished it with only their second win of the season			2
@entity22 defender @entity29 ( centre ) scored the only goal of the match heading home on 20 minutes @entity34 ( right ) is congratulated by his team - mates for his goal which moves the @entity37 off bottom spot @entity34 ( left ) celebrates his strike with @entity4 ( centre ) as he scores the first goal of his reign as @entity22 boss @entity44 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity45 5 ; caddis 5 , @entity46 6 , @entity47 6 , @entity48 6 ; @entity49 6 ( @entity50 66 , 6 ) , @entity51 6 ( @entity52 29 , 6 ) ; @entity53 6.5 , @entity54 7.5 , @entity55 6 ( @entity56 58 ) ; @entity57 6 subs not used : @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 booked : @entity47 sent off : @entity45 @entity22 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity63 7 ; @entity64 6 , @entity34 7 , @entity65 6.5 , @entity66 6 ( @entity67 79 ) ; @entity68 6 , @entity69 7 ; @entity70 6 , @entity71 7 , @entity72 6 ( @entity73 79 ) ; @entity74 5.5 subs not used : @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity61 , @entity78 , @entity79 goal : @entity34 20 booked : @entity34 referee : @entity82 6 attendance : 15,149 @entity84 : @entity54 he demonstrated his energy for management with a @entity88 - style dance down the line when @entity29 headed @entity22 in front			1
he stayed standing in his tracksuit when the heavens opened in the second half , eyes bulging and yelling instructions			2
he ended in the stands after the dust settled from @entity22 ’s late penalty , which they missed			1
for @entity44 , it means they have now won only once in 11 games in all competitions			2
it is a run made more understandable when you consider how they defended in the first half here			0
perhaps the penny did not drop when @entity69 , once of @entity109 , delivered a perfect corner into the box after 10 minutes and found @entity65 unmarked			0
@entity65 ’s header went wide and any message about the dangers of @entity69 ’s deliveries , not to mention the perils of poor marking , apparently went by the wayside			0
moments later , @entity74 was allowed to waste a free header in @entity44 ’s area and after 20 minutes , @entity69 sent over the cross that put @entity22 in front			1
again , the delivery was precise ; again @entity44 ’s defence did not serve its most basic purpose			2
@entity34 buried the header and @entity4 went for a touchline jog			1
@entity4 took charge of his first game as @entity22 manager on saturday against @entity44 in between those efforts , @entity44 did come close			1
indeed , creating chances was n’t their problem			0
in @entity54 and @entity53 , they had two attacking players who offered something to get excited about ; in @entity55 they have a player who can hit a fine free - kick , as he did in the 17th minute when he clipped the bar			0
@entity54 ’s chance a moment later was arguably better			0
@entity57 had dug out a cross from the right - hand byline and @entity54 timed his run perfectly			0
unfortunately for him , his half volley was drilled into the ground and bounced over			0
after @entity34 ’s opener , there were further chances for @entity44 ; further misses for @entity149 to regret			2
@entity44 's @entity53 ( left ) and @entity22 's @entity61 battle for the ball during their clash on saturday @entity53 ended a delightful run by shooting into the side - netting and @entity54 went on an exciting surge , holding off @entity68 as he went			1
his curling shot from the edge of the area was well saved by @entity63			0
it was encouraging , but tangible rewards are what the crowd want and the club need			0
@entity44 were loudly booed off at half time			1
@entity68 scuffed wide for @entity22 early in the second half and @entity54 came close to levelling 20 minutes from time , cutting in from the left and drawing a good save from @entity63 at his near post			1
@entity53 then wasted a better chance by launching a half volley over the bar from eight yards			0
@entity66 ( right ) tries to dispossess @entity44 's @entity53 ( left ) at @entity171 @entity4 swapped his gilet for a tracksuit top and @entity22 dug in			1
they still had the greater share of possession , but @entity44 were having the chances			2
@entity54 ’s effort from the left , which @entity63 tipped onto the bar , underlined the point			0
@entity72 sent a weak shot wide in retaliation before substitute @entity73 skied an 83rd - minute penalty that would have wrapped it up			1
@entity73 had won the spot kick after being brought down by @entity45 , who was sent off			1
@entity56 took the gloves as @entity44 had used all their substitutes , but did not need them			2
in the confusion , @entity4 was sent to the stands			2
a colourful start to life in @entity8 management			0
@entity73 ( left ) won a late penalty for @entity22 after being brought down by @entity45 @entity45 ( left ) was shown a red card by referee @entity82 ( right ) for the foul			1

@entity4 was appointed as @entity22 boss on *sunday*
@entity29 ' first half header gave the @entity37 *victory* at @entity201 's
@entity73 missed a late penalty after being fouled by @entity45
@entity44 *keeper* @entity45 was shown a red card for his foul
