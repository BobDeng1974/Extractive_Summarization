their score of 183.596 tuesday night was a whopping five points ahead of @entity13			1
some teenagers might find that pressure tough to bear , but the @entity0 reveled in it			1
' we knew we could do it			0
we just had to pull out all the stops , ' said @entity28 , the team captain			1
miss @entity9 added : ' there were a lot of rumors that we could n't do this because we won worlds , and there were a lot of doubts , ' we went out there to prove something and that 's what we did			1
' when they saw the @entity42 and @entity20 peeking in the doorway during training sessions , they would add some extra zest to their routines , the better to intimidate the competition			1
jaw - dropping : @entity9 's seemingly flawless vault left the judges in complete shock pride : @entity52 stands at the centre of the @entity55 podium with silver medallists @entity13 , left , and bronze medallists @entity20 , right victory : the @entity0 gymnasts huddle together after their performance during the @entity63 women 's team final in @entity64 miss @entity7 said : ' it 's crazy to think the @entity0 has n't won a gold medal since ' 96			1

' and when the gold was on the line , the @entity0 were simply spectacular			1
coach @entity74 , who is also miss @entity8 's personal coach , went a step farther			2
he said : ' this is the best team all - time			1
the ' 96 team might disagree			2
but this is the best team			2
@entity80 , consistency wise , this is @entity52 's finest			2
' the team essentially won the gold medal with their first event , vault , putting on a fireworks show right in front of the @entity42			1
all of the @entity0 do @entity89 , one of the toughest vaults in the world - a roundoff onto the takeoff board , back handspring onto the table and 2.5 twisting somersaults before landing			2
it 's got a start value - the measure of difficulty - of 6.5 , a whopping 0.7 above the vault most other gymnasts do , and they ripped off one massive one after another			1
world champion @entity8 went first and did perhaps the best one she 's ever done , getting great height in the air with her legs locked together			2
when her feet slammed into the mat on landing , she threw up her arms and smiled broadly			0
miss @entity8 's triumph followed a crushing disappointment on sunday , when she missed a shot at @entity55 gold due to international rules that allow only two competitors per country in the finals			1
she finished fourth in sunday 's qualifying round , but will miss a shot at @entity55 gold because international rules allow only two competitors per country in the finals			1

beaming : @entity0 gymnast @entity7 does a back flip on the balance beam during the @entity63 women 's team final flying triumph : @entity8 's stellar performance came after a crushing disappointment on sunday , when she missed a shot at @entity55 gold due to international rules that allow only two competitors per country in the finals shock : @entity42 gymnasts and team officials react as teammate @entity144 falls while performing on the floor during the floor exercise ' in this system it 's a shame that the all - around champion does n't get to compete in the finals at the @entity55 because of a stupid rule , ' mr @entity74 said			1
but speaking today , miss @entity8 called her team 's gold medal - winning performance ' redemption			1
' the two - per - country rule has been in place in each of the last two games , designed to give gymnasts from other countries a chance to make it to finals			2
ms @entity8 has only lost two all - around competitions in the last three years , both of them to teammates			2
following @entity8 's performance today , @entity7 went next and her vault was even better			2
victory dance : team @entity0 celebrates with their coaches after being declared winners of the gold medal graceful : in this multiple exposure photo , @entity0 gymnast @entity10 performs on the balance beam and then came @entity9 , who let everyone know why she 's a heavy favorite to add the @entity55 gold to her world title in vault			1
she hit the mat with tremendous force yet did n't so much as wiggle , triumphantly thrusting her arms in the air as she saluted the judges			0
the @entity0 strutted out of the event with a 1.7 - point lead , and never looked back			1
with the @entity42 on the sidelines crying , the @entity0 stood at the center of the flow , clapping , cheering and basking in a golden glow			0
when the score for captain @entity6 flashed , the @entity0 screamed and a chant of ' @entity0 ! @entity0 ! ' rang out around the arena			0
emotions : @entity0 finished five points ahead of silver medallist @entity13 , who were in tears at the conclusion of the event second place : @entity13 , which took home the silver medal , was left stunned by the @entity0 performance the @entity0 had come into the last two olympics as world champions , only to leave without a gold			1
but this team is the strongest , top to bottom , the @entity52 has ever had , and the rest of the world never stood a chance			2
after the @entity0 opened with a barrage of booming vaults , everyone else was playing for @entity220 erased all but four - tenths of the deficit on uneven bars , where @entity224 and @entity225 defy the laws of gravity , but the team began falling apart on balance beam			1
@entity225 swayed and wobbled so badly on the landing of a leap it 's a wonder she did n't fall off ; @entity224 almost stepped on the judges on her dismount			2
' we did everything we could , ' @entity224 said			0
the @entity0 , meanwhile , made the 4 - inch slab that stands 4 feet in the air look like child 's play			1
feat : @entity0 gymnast @entity6 wows the crowd as she performs on the balance beam @entity10 , the only @entity0 who was n't on that world team last year ( she was too young ) , looks like a ballerina with her long legs and gorgeous lines			2
she landed one somersault with her left foot curled over the edge of the beam , yet never flinched			0
@entity252 has struggled on balance beam all summer , with a fall the second day of the @entity0 championships costing her the title			0
but she has been clutch in @entity64 , delivering the highest score in qualifying and again tuesday night			0
she whipped off a series of backflips as if she was still on the ground , a look of intense concentration on her face			0
she had a small balance check on a leap , swaying slightly and waving her arms to steady herself , but it was a minor error			0
her score of 15.233 would all but seal the gold for the @entity0 , and they strutted over to floor exercise eager to close out the night with a big show			2
while the @entity42 struggled - @entity271 stumbled forward on one pass and botched another when she all but came to a dead stop in the middle of the floor , and world champion @entity144 landed her dismount on her knees - the @entity0 kicked off their victory party			0
@entity8 's bright smile grew as she danced and tumbled , the crowd clapping in time to her techno pop music			0
victory : @entity52 raise their hands after coming out of the gymnastics final with the gold medal making history : the win was @entity52 's first gymnastics gold medal since the 1996 summer games in @entity290 fans the world over are going to have the ' doo - doo - doo - doo - doo - doo ' from the start of @entity252 ' music in their heads , and little girls are sure to be bouncing in their backyards trying to get as high as she does on her leaps			1
@entity6 closed it out with a rollicking routine to ' @entity303			0
' while her teammates cheered , @entity6 soared high on her tumbling passes yet she landed so securely she may as well have been stepping into a bucket of cement			0
coach @entity308 was jumping up and down as @entity6 finished , the tears already starting to fall			0
but as she fell into her teammates arms , the tears turned to shrieks of joy			0
