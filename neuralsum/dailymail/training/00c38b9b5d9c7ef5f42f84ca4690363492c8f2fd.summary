on thursday morning i woke to find myself featured in a mini-media firestorm			0
why ? because i had shaken the hand of a woman i had just interviewed			0
but this was n't any woman – it was @entity7 , 33 , the nurse who is challenging her 21 - day quarantine after returning from treating @entity10 victims in @entity11			1
stories were written of our encounter with headlines such as : ' nurse breaks quarantine , shakes reporter 's hand '			2
it was newsworthy because she should not have contact with the public			0
i was one of a handful of reporters outside her home in @entity27 , @entity28 , when she decided to come outside and talk about her ' appalling ' confinement			1
under @entity28 's official health guidelines she is not supposed to be in public until the three - week period is over			1
that is not until november 10			0
the guidelines are not mandatory but are voluntary			1
after she made it clear that she does n't intend to stick to the rules - which are more stringent than those imposed by the @entity41 - @entity28 officials are preparing to secure a court order to force her to stay away from the public			1
she thanked @entity48 on the spot : @entity48 takes notes as @entity7 protests her treatment which she has branded as ' appalling ' defiant @entity7 is living with her boyfriend , @entity52 - who has been out and about talking to friends			1
and on thursday she went for a bike ride followed by a gaggle of reporters and cameramen			0
despite a state trooper being stationed outside the house , no one tried to prevent people from getting close to her			0
wednesday night 's impromptu press conference was the first time i had been face - to - face with @entity7			1
towards the end she bemoaned the fact that despite showing no symptoms of infection , she should n't hug or even shake her hand of people she meets			2
on the spur of the moment , i simply said : ' i 'll shake your hand , ' and i did			2
it felt like a common courtesy to someone i had just been asking questions of			1
it was a brief handshake , nothing memorable , something i have done thousands of times before			0
she had a firm grip			0
she looked me briefly in the eye and thanked me			0
i turned to leave her property as she and @entity52 went back inside			0
one local @entity28 journalist told me he had thought about doing the same but i got there first			2
medical experts say the chances of @entity7 falling ill from @entity10 are now extremely remote and the risk of transmitting the virus while she is healthy are so slight as to be virtually non-existent – particularly to someone like me who touched her hand so briefly			2
defiant : @entity7 and @entity52 took an hour - long bike ride this morning - followed by state police in car behind ' hiding under the covers ' : @entity104 shook hands on wednesday with healthcare workers who had recently returned from @entity10 hot zones and were still in the 21 - day risk period			1
he attacked critics who were imposing strict quarantine rules on those the president described as ' @entity114 heroes ' president @entity104 on wednesday tried to reassure the public that it is safe to touch healthcare workers returning from @entity10 ' hot zones ' when he did the same and shook the hands of doctors and nurses in the 21 - day risk period at the @entity124			1
the one question i have been asked repeatedly since is : ' did i wash my hands afterwards ? '			2
yes i did - partly because i was going out to dinner and i would have washed them anyway .			0

@entity48 shook hands with nurse on spur of the moment after she *stepped* out of her @entity27 , @entity28 , home to insist she was not *contagious*
@entity7 , 33 , is challenging the state 's guidelines which say she must stay indoors for 21 days - until virus *incubation* period is over
and state is preparing to get a court order to make voluntary guidelines mandatory after she said she would not stick to them
@entity48 said it he did it as a common courtesy after @entity7 said she was n't even allowed to hug or shake hands with her friends
he did wash his hands afterwards though
