@entity2 drones were in the skies above the @entity2 consulate in @entity5 as the deadly attack that killed ambassador @entity7 unfolded , it has been revealed			1
defense department officials considered sending troops in to rescue the ambassador and staff , according to @entity12 , but ultimately decided not to			0
they would haven been able to watch the attack on - screen as it unfolded			0
the revalations came a day after it emerged that @entity2 ambassador @entity7 repeatedly pleaded with the @entity18 to ramp up his security team in @entity20 -- requests that the @entity22 ultimately denied -- in the weeks , days and hours leading up to the terrorist attack that killed him and three other @entity2 , newly released cables have revealed			1
@entity7 , who was killed in the 11 september attack on the @entity2 consulate in @entity5 , warned the @entity18 of a ' security vacuum ' in @entity20 ' that is being exploited by independent actors ' in one cable that described rapidly deteriorating security conditions			1
' islamic extremists are able to attack the @entity32 with impunity , ' he wrote			0
' what we have seen are not random crimes of opportunity but rather targeted discriminate attacks			0
' @entity39 : the second building attacked in the @entity5 raid , pictured , was in fact a @entity44 base deadly : four @entity2 , including ambassador @entity7 , died in the attack on the @entity2 @entity46 in @entity5 @entity7 said the attackers would not be deterred ' until authorities are at least as capable			1
' just hours before his death , he sent the @entity22 a cable describing ' expanding @entity52 influence in @entity53 , ' a town east of @entity5 , and said he was seeing a ' troubling increase in violence and @entity52 influence			0
' @entity7 recapped a meeting in which the commander of @entity5 's @entity60 told him there is ' growing frustration with police and security forces			1
' the cables were released by @entity66 rep. @entity66 of @entity67 , the chairman of the @entity2 @entity68 , which is investigating the security matters surrounding @entity7 ' death and questioning whether the @entity18 could have prevented the deadly attack			1
less than three weeks ahead of the presidential election , republicans are using the cables to attack president @entity76 on his foreign policy , despite the @entity18 's claim that it was solely responsible for the decisions to deny @entity7 ' requests for more security in @entity20			1
' these critical foreign policy decisions are not made by low or mid-level career officials -- they are typically made through a structured and well - reasoned process that includes the @entity86 and the @entity87 , ' @entity66 wrote in a letter to @entity76 on friday			1
killed : ambassador @entity7 ( left ) died following smoke inhalation , while agent @entity90 ( right ) died in a desperate battle heroic : former @entity92 ( left ) and @entity93 ( right ) were killed in a mortar attack the letter claims that @entity76 had a political motivation in rejecting @entity7 ' security requests , since the president was eager to show improving conditions in @entity20 after the @entity2 - led international operation that toppled @entity20 dictator @entity101			1
on aug. 2 , six weeks before @entity7 was killed , he requested ' protective detail bodyguard ' positions , calling the security situation in @entity20 ' unpredictable , volatile and violent			1
' a month earlier , he requested that the @entity18 extend his tour of duty personnel , which is a 16 - man temporary security team trained in combating terrorism			1
the request was denied and the security team left 8 august			1
@entity7 had asked for the security team to stay through mid-september			2
colonel @entity111 , the leader of the security team that left @entity20 in the weeks before the terror attack , told @entity12 that @entity7 fought hard against losing the team			2
' it was quite a degree of frustration on their part , ' he said			0
' they were -- i guess you could say -- clenched - fist over the whole issue			0
questions : in their debate on tuesday , president @entity76 and @entity129 challenger @entity128 argued over when @entity76 first said it was a terror attack the @entity87 maintained publicly for a week that the attack on the @entity2 consulate in @entity20 was a spontaneous mob upset about an anti-islam video , even though it has now been revealed that they were informed within 24 hours of the attack that it was planned and carried out by militants			1
' your administration has not been straightforward with the @entity2 people in the aftermath of the attack , ' @entity66 wrote in his letter to @entity76			1
in his @entity144 address the morning after the killings , @entity76 said , ' no acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation , alter that character or eclipse the light of the values that we stand for			2
' but @entity129 say he was speaking generally and did n't specifically call the @entity5 attack a terror attack until weeks later , with the president and other key members of his administration referring at first to the @entity160 movie circulating on the internet as a precipitating event			2
last week , the @entity18 said that it never believed the 11 september attack on the @entity2 consulate was the result of a protest over an anti-islam movie , contradicting previous statements			1
inferno : armed attackers dumped cans of diesel fuel and set ablaze the consulate 's exterior siege : the compound came under heavy mortar and gunfire during the attack , which lasted several hours the @entity87 now says the attack probably was carried out by an @entity182 - linked group , with no public demonstration beforehand			2
secretary of state @entity184 blamed the ' fog of war ' for the early conflicting accounts			0
@entity66 's committee questioned @entity18 officials for hours about what @entity129 lawmakers said was lax security at the consulate , given the growth of extremist @entity195 militants in @entity196			1
congressional aides are hoping to use @entity7 ' cables and information from @entity18 testimonies to build a timeline of what the intelligence community knew , compared to what the @entity87 was telling the public about the attack			1
that could give @entity128 ammunition to use in his foreign policy debate with @entity76 on monday night			2
reports have revealed that the @entity44 station chief in @entity20 compiled an intelligence briefing from eyewitnesses within 24 hours of the assault on the consulate that indicated militants launched the violence			0
the briefing from the station chief was written late wednesday , 12 september and reached intelligence agencies in @entity222 the next day , intelligence officials said			0
yet on saturday of that week , briefing points sent by the @entity44 to @entity224 said ' demonstrations in @entity5 were spontaneously inspired by the protests at the @entity227 in @entity228 and evolved into a direct assault			0
' haven : ambassador @entity7 and @entity90 were hiding in a safe room which later filled with diesel smoke the briefing points , obtained by the @entity234 , added : ' there are indications that extremists participated in the violent demonstrations ' but did not mention eyewitness accounts that blamed militants alone			1
such raw intelligence reports by the @entity44 on the ground would normally be sent first to analysts at the headquarters in @entity245 , @entity246 , for vetting and comparing against other intelligence derived from eavesdropping drones and satellite images			0
only then would such intelligence generally be shared with the @entity87 and later , @entity224 , a process that can take hours , or days if the intelligence is coming only from one or two sources who may or may not be trusted			2
@entity2 intelligence officials say in this case the delay was due in part to the time it took to analyze various conflicting accounts			2
one official , speaking on condition of anonymity because he was n't authorized to discuss the incident publicly , explained that ' it was clear a group of people gathered that evening ' in @entity5 , but that the early question was ' whether extremists took over a crowd or they were the crowd			0
' but that explanation has been met with concern in @entity224			0
flames , grenades and gunfire : a burnt - out car in front of the @entity2 consulate ' the early sense from the intelligence community differs from what we are hearing now , ' @entity282 rep. @entity281 said			2
' it ended up being pretty far afield , so we want to figure out why ... though we do n't want to deter the intelligence community from sharing their best first impressions ' after such events in the future			0
' the intelligence briefings we got a week to 10 days after were consistent with what the administration was saying , ' said rep. @entity295 , a member of the @entity297 committees			0
@entity295 would not confirm the existence of the early @entity44 report but voiced skepticism over how sure intelligence officials , including cia director @entity302 , seemed of their original account when they briefed lawmakers on @entity305			0
' how could they be so certain immediately after such events , i just do n't know , ' he said			0
' that raises suspicions that there was political motivation			0

@entity2 ambassador @entity7 repeatedly pleaded with the @entity18 for *additional* security personnel
@entity129 say the @entity76 administration denied the request for political reasons
the @entity87 says it had no role in procuring security detail for @entity7
