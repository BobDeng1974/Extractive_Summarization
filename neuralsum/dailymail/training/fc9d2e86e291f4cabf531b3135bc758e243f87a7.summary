by @entity0 published : 06:10 est , 11 july 2013 updated : 08:33 est , 11 july 2013 a man who claims his tent , car and dog were snatched by aliens on a camping trip in @entity7 has spoken out about his harrowing experience			1
@entity9 , 37 , said that he looked on ' gobsmacked ' as a fleet of 12 to 15 spacecrafts homed into view one evening in 1992 while on a camping trip with friends @entity14 and @entity16			1
@entity9 and his friends had asked permission from their parents to go on the trip , but the group were left disappointed when before they even had a chance to pitch their tent , they claim the alien vessels made off with the @entity26 and its contents			1
believer : @entity9 says he is willing to take a lie detector test over his claims that aliens stole his car mr @entity9 from @entity34 , @entity7 explained that they had parked up the car in @entity37 and went looking for somewhere to pitch their tent			1
it was then that the locked car disappeared without the engine starting - with @entity9 ’s tent and @entity43 ’ eight - week - old pit bull @entity45 terrier still inside			1
he said : ' it all happened so fast in about three to five minutes			1
i walked back to the car and it had just vanished off the face of the earth ' determined : @entity9 has written to the @entity53 about the abduction of his @entity26 by aliens back in 1992 it was then that all three noticed a bright glow above the trees for just under a minute			1
for ' defence purposes ' the @entity53 offered a @entity61 hotline for more than 50 years , investigating sightings from all around the @entity63			1
its archives show one man ' made weapon to shoot down alien spaceships ' and that @entity61 were reported over as hovering over landmarks such as @entity69 and the @entity70			2
one letter from a child in @entity73 demanded a reply to whether there was life ' outside our planet ... i have the right to know '			2
there was an alarming surge in sightings after the service closed down in 2009 , with more than 600 alien experiences were reported to the hotline that year			2
however , the eerie orange lights that many people saw in the skies were most likely to be @entity91 lanterns , which were fashionable for weddings and parties			2
' these lights came from behind these massive trees			2
about 12 to 15 of them			2
i thought they were pink flamingos			0
my other mates thought they were fire flies , ' he said			0
' they then just speeded up and were gone in 30 seconds			0
i was baffled - so confused			1
' the next day , @entity9 and his friends reported the incident to the police , leaving out the mysterious floating objects , but a search for the @entity26 and its contents proved futile			1
keen to find out what he saw , @entity9 sent a handwritten letter and diagram showing the alien space crafts to the @entity53 in october 1992			0
to this day he still says : ' i do n’t 100 per cent know what happened but i ’m going to believe it for the rest of my life			0
i ’m willing to have a lie detector test , ' he said			0
@entity117 ’ story was just one of many extraterrestrial tales revealed to the public when the @entity53 released its final cache of @entity61 documents			0
the 25 files contained 4,400 pages of reports received between 2007 and 2009 with details of alien abductions , air chases between police and ufos and spaceship wreckages			0
close encounters : the @entity53 has 4,400 pages of reports on @entity61 sightings in its collections ( artist 's impression of @entity61 ) the @entity53 ’s @entity61 desk , which handled these reports , saw the number of @entity61 sightings rocket , with 600 reported in 2009 alone			0
buckling under the weight of these submissions , the project was recently shut down , but @entity145 , who worked for the @entity61 project from 1991 to 1994 said believers should not be laughed off too quickly			0
' the believers only have to be proved right once , ' he said .			0

he claims it disappeared with an eight - week - old pit bull terrier still inside
he and two friends were going to camp near @entity7 ' but aliens took their tent '
