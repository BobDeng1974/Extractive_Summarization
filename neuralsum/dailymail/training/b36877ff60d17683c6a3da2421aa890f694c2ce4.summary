by @entity0 an internet marketing millionaire from @entity3 , @entity4 , has been accused by the @entity5 of being the ' mastermind ' behind one of the biggest cases of online marketing fraud ever perpetrated in @entity10			1
@entity11 , 37 , has become known in his native @entity4 for his selfless acts of heroism , including mounting his own relief mission to @entity15 after the earthquake in 2010 , and literally giving the shoes off his feet			1
but according to the @entity20 , the money @entity11 has so generously donated was n't his to give , and had in fact been amassed by luring online customers with promises of free @entity24 for which they only had to pay a nominal shipping fee			1
these customers ' credit cards would then be charged for recurring monthly memberships they had n't agreed to and were n't aware of			2
alleged scam : indicted @entity3 businessman @entity11 walks to the federal courthouse before a hearing thursday , june 13 , 2013 , in @entity33 over a five - year period , the company of which @entity11 was founder and ceo , i works , allegedly stole more than $ 275 million from customers , and discouraged them from seeking compensation from their credit card companies by threatening to report them to a website called @entity44 - a site run by @entity36			1
and while @entity11 's philanthropy was well - known , his lifestyle was not exactly humble			2
according to the @entity53 , he owns a 22,000 - square - foot home in a gated community in a @entity3 suburb , a 1957 @entity51 and other classic cars , houseboats and helicopters			0
his case files contain statements from witnesses alleging he ' amassed bundles of cash and buried caches of gold '			0
it 's a fall from a great height for the six - foot - tall , red - headed @entity11 , who appeared to be casting himself into the ' affable millionaire ' mold by rescuing stranded mountaineers in his helicopter and housing people fleeing from @entity4 's polygamous communities			1
' when i think of @entity11 , i think of the most generous person i ever met , ' @entity72 , an assistant loan officer in @entity73 , @entity4 and friend of @entity11 , told @entity53			1
' whatever he had , he would give and give and give			0
' @entity72 described @entity11 , who he met as a boy scout , as ' one of the most @entity81 - like people i have ever come to know			2
' philanthropy : here , @entity11 works to provide aid for people affected by the @entity15 earthquake in 2010 in addition to the @entity20 investigation , @entity11 and five of his associates are now facing 86 related criminal charges , including making false statements to bank , wire fraud , bank fraud , engaging in fraudulent banking activities , conspiracy to launder money and money laundering brought by the @entity10 attorney in @entity4			1
@entity11 categorically denies any wrongdoing in both cases			0
according the the @entity53 , court filings by his lawyers say the @entity5 's case is ' filled with half - truths , distortions and inflammatory rhetoric that is not supported by the evidence			0
' according to the @entity111 , the company allegedly set up 80 ' shell accounts ' to accept payments without being detected			0
high places : @entity4 attorney general @entity115 received more than $ 200,000 in campaign donations from @entity11 but is no longer commenting on @entity11 or the case ' they had no employees , they had no office locations , they were mail drops , ' @entity118 , the lead @entity5 attorney on the lawsuit , told the @entity111			1
' they were essentially fronts , and they did n't have any substance to them other than lending their name to obtain a new merchant account when @entity11 and @entity36 were no longer able to get merchant accounts			0
' @entity11 's business offered customers catalogs of government grants and information about how to apply for them			2
once someone signed up for a catalog , to be delivered via main on a @entity24 , they were then given one week to cancel their membership , after which they were signed up for membership to various different programs which all charged a monthly fee			0
denial : @entity11 has denied any wrongdoing in the case against him , in which he allegedly swindled more than $ 275 million from unwitting consumers this is legal - if the marketing material makes full disclosure to the customer and the customer consents			1
but according to federal prosecutors , i works - affiliated sites often displayed disclosures in very small print , and sometimes did n't disclose the information at all			0
according to the @entity53 , the @entity5 began investigating @entity36 in 2009 after @entity165 noticed an ever - growing number of customers wanting to reverse charges for online membership programs , called a ' chargeback '			1
it was difficult at first to link the chargebacks to @entity36 , since the company was operating under so many different names and so many different programs , including @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity179 , cloud nine marketing , @entity181 , @entity182 and many , many more , according to court papers			0
@entity36 was closed after the charges were brought , but according to prosecutors , @entity11 transferred many of his assets , including gold bullion and his home , into the names of his parents and his wife , @entity191 , who have now been named as ' relief defendants ' by prosecutors for receiving ill - gotten gains			1
@entity11 went on the offensive after being indicted			0
according to the @entity111 , he launched an online campaign to clear his name			0
he accused federal prosecutors of threatening to indict his family if he does n't plead guilty in his criminal case and accused a @entity5 attorney of tampering with witnesses in @entity204 videos , created an @entity206 website which he promoted on @entity207 , made a @entity209 page where people can make negative comments about the @entity212 for the @entity213 and conducted interviews with reporters in which he reiterated the points he 's made online			0
federal prosecutors grew weary of this and a federal judge granted a gag order against @entity11 and his associates to prevent them from commenting publicly about the case			1
according to the @entity111 , @entity11 has been arrested twice since he was charged in 2010 : ' once in a @entity224 airport attempting to leave the country en route to @entity227 , a few months after receiving a federal indictment for mail fraud ' and again ' in @entity230 for an outstanding @entity232 warrant , which was issued after he bounced several bad checks meant to cover more than $ 100,000 in gambling losses at a @entity236 casino '			2
the @entity5 case against @entity11 in the @entity238 of @entity232 is ongoing , and the criminal charges against him will be pursued at its conclusion .			2
