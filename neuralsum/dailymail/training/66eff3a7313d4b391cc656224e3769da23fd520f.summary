a 35 - year - old former teacher accused of having sex with three male students cried in court on thursday as she pleaded not guilty to the charges			1
@entity5 became emotional as she entered the courtroom in @entity7 , @entity8 on thursday afternoon dressed in a black - and - white striped jail jumpsuit - a stark contrast to the tight black pencil skirt , red shirt and sky - high heels she wore to her preliminary hearing last week			1
the former high school @entity17 teacher has been charged with 14 felonies , including rape , sodomy and sex abuse , stemming from the sexual relationships she allegedly had with the three teenagers			2
last week , one of the boys testified that he had sex with @entity28 at least three times while she was free on bail in connection with charges from the other two cases			1
but while authorities and many members of the @entity55 community are eager to put @entity28 away for years , she has an unlikely cheerleader : one of her alleged victims			0
the man , now 18 , testified against his former teacher on thursday despite being ' very unhappy ' about doing so , the @entity58 reports			2
' it 's ridiculous , ' he said			2
' she does n't deserve to be here			0
' he told the court he had sex with @entity28 once prior to october 2013 - when she was initially arrested - and then three more times after that december while she was out on bail			1
in august 2014 , a second student came forward to say he had also had a physical relationship with the former @entity72 @entity17 teacher , whose marriage fell apart in the aftermath of the scandal			0
what a difference a week makes : last week , @entity28 was in court for a preliminary hearing - but a judge agreed she should be held without bail after it emerged that she had sex with one of the students while out on bail denial : the teacher , pictured on january 15 , has denied sexual relationships with the boys - but one was able to describe her home in detail and recalled tattoos she has on her body , police said one of the teenage boys , now 18 , told a court in september how he was just 17 when he became involved with @entity28 between april and june of 2013 , the @entity58 reported			1
he said it began with kissing between class periods and eventually graduated to sexual intercourse			0
when asked to describe his relationship , the teen boy said she was his ' teacher with benefits '			0
@entity5 's attorney , @entity104 , has said in court his client denies any romantic involvement with the three students			1
' it is her defense that they did not happen at all , ' he wrote in a motion			0
' that she never engaged in any inappropriate contact with either of her students			0
' prosecutors said the teacher acknowledged to investigators that she had engaged in sex with a 16 - year - old boy on two occasions			1
the teen was allegedly able to accurately describe the layout of @entity5 's home to detectives as well as tattoos on her body			1
in deep : @entity5 , pictured in court in february 2014 , told investigators that she had sex with a 16 - year - old boy - but later her attorney said she had been intimidated into confessing by male officers arrest : she was first taken into custody in 2013 but now remains in jail without bond but @entity104 asked the judge to not allow those statements at her trial , arguing that she was intimidated by the eight to 10 male officers who came to her home in october 2013 to interview her			1
brass argued that the officers would not let her care for children , call an attorney or use the restroom for nearly four hours as they questioned her			0
' her statements were coerced and involuntary and were taken in violation of her so - called @entity152 rights , ' brass wrote in court papers			2
' the evidence she provided was the product of that tainted statement			0
' no trial dates have yet been set but she faces up to life in prison if convicted .			0

@entity5 ' had sex with three teenage students - and even when she was on bail , she had sex with one of the boys at least three more times '
she was ordered to be held without bail last week
one of the boys testified against her but called charges ' ridiculous '
