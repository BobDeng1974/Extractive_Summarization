by @entity0 published : 17:02 est , 1 march 2013 updated : 11:09 est , 2 march 2013 whistleblower : bosses tried to silence @entity3 a whistleblower claimed last night that she was hired by an @entity6 hospital to fiddle its shocking death rates			1
as hundreds of patients died needlessly , @entity3 says she was headhunted by hospital bosses and asked to ' fix ' the figures			0
she claims ' every rule in the book ' was broken to try to improve mortality rates – without saving lives			1
the data recorder says she was suspended after refusing to take part in a cover - up , and even claims she was ordered not to put her concerns in writing in case they reached the @entity21			2
the astonishing allegations – which are denied by the hospital – have emerged days after the chief executive of another @entity25 , in @entity26 , was forced aside over a possible cover - up of high death rates			1
experts have warned similar incidents could be happening in hospitals across the country			0
the fresh allegations are yet another blow for @entity6 chief executive sir @entity35 , who refuses to resign despite widespread condemnation from mps , doctors and patients since last month ’s damning @entity41 report			0
mrs @entity3 was hired by the @entity42 as a ‘ health coder ’ , an administrative role which involves recording data detailing patients ’ care in hospitals			2
coders do not need medical qualifications , leading critics to argue that they have disproportionate power to affect how hospitals are seen to be performing			0
mrs @entity3 , from @entity52 , said she was approached following concerns over the shocking number of weekend deaths , which had contributed to the @entity25 scoring one of the highest mortality rates in the country			1
damning : mrs @entity3 added that patient care at @entity60 was as bad or worse as at scandal - hit @entity61 ( pictured ) she said she ‘ would n’t even send a dog ’ to @entity63 and claims patient care was as bad or worse as at scandal - hit @entity61 , where as many as 1,200 patients died needlessly			1
but instead of making efforts to improve care , bosses at the @entity25 were convinced that the high death rate could be ‘ fixed ’ by fiddling statistics , she said			1
she claimed they offered to almost double her salary to £ 54,000 a year to distort mortality figures , mistakenly believing she had been doing the same at her former employer , @entity73			1
‘ they wanted me to fix it			0
but they did n’t want me to fix it properly , ’ she said			0
she took the job in october 2011 – but said that when she realised what hospital bosses wanted her to do , she refused			2
however , she claimed others at the @entity25 were ‘ breaking every rule in the book ’			1
the allegations are another blow for @entity6 chief executive sir @entity35 ( pictured ) for example , recording that a patient was being treated by the palliative care team means their death , effectively , does not alter the mortality rate , because it is classed as unavoidable			1
she claims the @entity25 used any excuse to code patients ’ deaths as unavoidable , even if they were never seen by palliative care doctors			1
the @entity25 angrily denies this claim – yet between 2009 and 2011 , @entity60 ’s death rate dropped by 13 per cent , from very worrying levels to the national average			2
this coincided with the number of deaths recorded as ‘ palliative care ’ soaring from 2.19 per cent to 20.3 per cent , about double the national average			1
the whistleblower said the @entity25 also hired an independent company in 2011 to advise coders on how to make deaths count for less on the mortality score – yet said she made sure this was not acted on			1
and she also claims she accused bosses of fraud as the @entity25 was making money by charging the local @entity116 for expensive procedures they had not done			2
in response , she says a senior figure warned her not to put allegations in writing because ‘ the @entity21 can get hold of it through @entity123 ’			0
after four months at the @entity25 , mrs @entity124 was suspended for alleged bullying and harassment – which she denies			2
she says the real reason she was suspended was to silence her			0
she is still suspended pending a disciplinary hearing , but decided to speak out despite fearing the repercussions			0
the @entity131 strenuously denied mrs @entity3 ’s allegations			0
protest : people gather calling for @entity6 chief executive sir @entity35 to resign chief executive @entity134 said ‘ every @entity25 in the country looked to @entity136 ’ at the time to learn how to reduce death rates – but denied hiring mrs @entity3 to ‘ fiddle ’ death rates			1
‘ we categorically deny the allegations , ’ he said			0
‘ the suggestion of any wrongdoing is simply not true			0
improvements in the hospital ’s mortality rates have been audited and independently verified			2
’ the @entity25 admitted , however , they had been coding against national guidelines , but said they corrected this as soon as they became aware of the mistake			0
the @entity25 added that it was ‘ categorically false ’ to suggest palliative care patients had been coded incorrectly to alter overall death rates			1
they explained the fall by saying 200 fewer patients had died .			0
