@entity2 only came forward after reading an article in the @entity21 last week about @entity22 - the man believed to be the sole - survivor of the crash			1
so he called up the @entity21 and said : ' i 'm also a survivor '			1
@entity2 was in the @entity5 working in the @entity26 when the crash happened			1
the bracero program was establed in 1942 and ran until 1964 , bringing some 5 million foreign workers to the country to supplement labor shortages caused by @entity31 - many of them @entity14 nationals			2
@entity2 says he had to pay 700 pesos to sign up for the program , a fee he was only able to afford once starting work in @entity7			2
' frankly , they treated you like a little animal , they sent you from here to there , ' he said			0
' ( the employers ) were the ones who did everything			0
they would tell you to either go to @entity49 , the @entity50 or @entity51			0
three of us from my town came to @entity51			0
' he says he entered the program with three others from his hometown and they were all stationed at a celery farm near @entity61			1
it was after a day of cutting and bagging celery that the workers were boarded onto a bus to be shuttled back to their work camp			2
the workers sat on four boards , two in the middle and two on the sides of the bus			2
once everyone was seated the bus began to move , but @entity2 had gotten up to go to the front of the bus			1
deadly : @entity2 and other foreign laborers were leaving a day of work on a celery farm in september 1963 when their bus was hit by a train			1
twenty - eight people died on the scene and four later at the hospital			1
above , the site of the accident he left a bag tied to the table near the front of the vehicle , and therefore escaped the direct hit of a train that hit the back of the bus			1
he says he did n't hear the train whistle , but rememebrs feeling the impact			2
when he came to , there were already bodies on the ground covered in orange blankets and then he passed out again			0
when he woke up again , he started looking for his friend @entity101 but could n't find him			0
' i walked to the bodies , uncovered the tarps , saw two or three bodies , but i did n't recognize any of them			0
i kept walking and when i could n't walk anymore , i sat by the edge of the field			0
twenty - eight people died at the scene and four later at the hospital in what the @entity112 has described as the biggest fatal vehicle accident in @entity5 history			1
lives lost : above , the road that bracero farm workers were traveling as they crossed the train tracks and were hit by a northbound train september 17 , 1963 , in @entity61 , @entity7 @entity2 was taken to @entity121 , where a woman volunteered to help write his family at home			1
' she told my mom that i was ok , not to be worried			0
i was all banged up , my shoulder blade was broken , but i could walk , ' @entity2 recalls			0
after spending two months in the hospital , @entity2 returned home to @entity18 and spent the next several years traveling into @entity130 for interviews with insurance companies about a settlement			2
in 1968 he was awarded 92,000 pesos			0
' during those visits , i used to see some of the remaining survivors , the widows and the mothers , ' he said			0
' after we got the money , i lost track of everybody			0
i 've always thought about the event , but i lost touch			0
' @entity2 revisted that dark day two years ago though when he returned to site of the crash and found nothing - no marker to remember the lost lives			1
going back to the scene : @entity2 stands next to a sign memorializes the deadly crash this september marked the 50th anniversary of the crash , and there 's been renewed interest in the event especially among immigration rights actvists who sucessfully lobbied to get a stretch of @entity159 dedicated as the @entity160			1
the dedication was held in september , and today there 's a sign marking the crash where @entity2 found nothing two years ago			1
the sign reads : ' @entity167 braceros			0
' on thursday , @entity2 traveled back to the accident site with his wife and son to talk with researchers about the accident and his part in the @entity26			2
he also appeared with @entity22 , the only other survivor of the crash , at a ceremony honoring 10 former braceros at @entity177 the same day .			0

@entity2 was 19 - years - old and working on a celery farm at the time of the crash
now 70 , @entity2 decided to come forward after reading a story that *inaccurately* identified another man as the sole - survivor of the crash
he called the @entity21 to say he too survived the accident
a train crashed into a bus carrying @entity2 and other workers leaving the farm on september 17 , 1963
but @entity2 had gone to the front of the bus to get a bag and escaped the direct impact
