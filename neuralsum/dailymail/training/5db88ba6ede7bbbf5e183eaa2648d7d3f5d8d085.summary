by @entity0 published : 03:05 est , 21 october 2012 updated : 08:34 est , 22 october 2012 more than a quarter of mps have billed the taxpayer for first - class rail travel in the past year - despite a supposed crackdown on the practice			1
a study of @entity2 ' expenses yesterday revealed that 185 had claimed for first - class rail tickets rather than travel in standard class			1
those involved include transport secretary @entity13 , cabinet office minister @entity14 , shadow chancellor @entity15 and his wife , shadow home secretary @entity16			0
@entity17 in @entity18 on the train from @entity20 to @entity21 with his aide watching a dvd the claims were made by 113 @entity2 , 48 conservatives , 19 @entity26 , three @entity27 and two @entity29 members			1
ten members of @entity32 ’s front - bench team are among the @entity34 claimants			0
the findings came as the government tried to play down embarrassment over chancellor @entity17 ’s decision to travel in a first - class carriage after purchasing a standard ticket on friday			1
his office insisted he had always intended to pay for the upgrade and that an aide had sought out the train manager to do so			0
he is alleged to have found himself in the same situation in may , when he was also caught with a standard ticket in @entity18			1
however , on that occasion he is said to have refused to pay the upgrade and instead ' slummed it ' with ordinary travellers in economy class for the rest of the journey between @entity21 and his constituency in @entity55 , @entity56			0
a commuter who was on the train in may told the @entity59 : ' mr @entity17 was confronted in first class by an inspector			2
the official seemed a bit embarrassed by the whole thing but quite correctly he treated mr @entity17 like anyone else			0
' after a short discussion mr @entity17 gathered up his things and moved to a different carriage and slummed it with everyone else			2
' i was a bit shocked to see the chancellor trying to blag a cheap seat			0
i 'd have thought with the money he has that he could afford the ticket			0
' the chancellor faced embarrassment after being caught in the @entity18 carriage with the wrong ticket after getting off the train @entity17 was confronted by journalists who had seen a string of tweets about the fiasco but a television reporter travelling on the same train claimed that the aide had actually got into a confrontation with an inspector over whether he should have moved to standard			1
according to @entity95 ’s analysis , some of the first - class ticket claims have cost as much as £ 300 , five times as much as the cheapest standard fare for the same route			1
@entity100 's guidelines on travel expenses suggest @entity2 should consider ‘ value for money ’ and whether cheaper , inflexible tickets will end up costing more if travel arrangements change at short notice			2
‘ you can claim for first - class travel if it is less than the cost of a standard open fare , ’ it states			2
first - class tickets purchased far enough in advance can end up cheaper than open standard tickets bought shortly before the journey			1
but @entity117 chief executive @entity116 said : ‘ if mps can get themselves organised to order a first - class ticket in advance , they should be able to order a standard - class ticket in plenty of time as well and it will almost always be cheaper			1
shadow chancellor @entity15 , left , and transport secretary @entity13 , right , are among the @entity2 who have travelled first - class on trains and claimed the cost on expenses ‘ if standard - class travel is n't good enough for mps , it is n't good enough for ordinary commuters who pay for their own tickets			1
’ @entity17 was forced to hand over nearly £ 200 by a railway ticket inspector during his trip on the 3.11pm @entity136 service from @entity20 , @entity56 , to @entity137 this week			2
@entity138 , a journalist with @entity139 , tweeted from the train : ‘ very interesting train journey to @entity137 chancellor @entity17 just got on at @entity20 with a standard ticket and he has sat in first class			1
‘ his aide tells ticket collector he can not possibly move and sit with the likes of us in standard class and requests he is allowed to remain in @entity18			0
’ her account was disputed by sources close to mr @entity17 , who insisted there was never any question of him not paying for the upgrade – and it came to £ 189.90 for the two tickets			0
the source said : ‘ the chancellor got a different train than planned due to a diary change following a series of meetings in his constituency			0
‘ as he had no seat reservation on the new train which was crowded , he decided to upgrade – and obviously intended and was happy to pay			0
an aide sorted the ticket upgrade			0

in the past year 185 mps have claimed for first - class train tickets on expenses
the ticket claims go against government guidelines *introduced* following the expenses *scandal* in 2009
it comes after chancellor @entity17 entered a first - class carriage without a ticket on friday
he was also alleged to have been caught in the same situation five months *ago*
