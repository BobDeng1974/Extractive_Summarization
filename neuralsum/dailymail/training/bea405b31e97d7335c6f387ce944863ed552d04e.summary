@entity0 was held for 13 months by @entity1 and was freed after a ransom was paid a freed @entity1 hostage is making a desperate plea for cash in a @entity7 campaign that reveals he is saddled with ' overwhelming debts ' after paying a huge ransom for freedom			1
@entity0 , who was held for 13 months with the @entity12 and @entity13 beheaded by @entity14 , was freed after a secret fundraising campaign by his family and friends			1
the move is controversial because the four men were executed after the @entity21 and @entity22 administrations refused to give in to demands to trade their lives for cash - and @entity13 claims it is against the law to pay ransoms			1
but in the dramatic appeal for money on @entity7 , @entity0 's older sister @entity28 confirms that a huge sum was paid for her brother 's release in june			2
she writes : ' @entity0 struggles every day -- a struggle to make sense of the violent experiences and find his way back to normal life			1
' @entity0 's situation right now limits his ability to earn money , and he therefore hopes that anyone interested will be able to help him			2
' jihadi @entity14 savagely executed his four fellow hostages – @entity12 journalists @entity45 and @entity47 and the @entity13 aid workers @entity49 and @entity50 – after the @entity21 and @entity22 administrations told the families not to give in to a blitz of death threats			1
the @entity55 government claims it has a similar policy			2
in a statement to @entity60 , a @entity13 @entity58 spokesman said it was against international law to pay ransom to terrorists			1
@entity12 journalist @entity45 , who was held alongside @entity0 , was apparently beheaded in a video on august 19 briton @entity49 was apparently beheaded in a video released on september 13 however , in her @entity7 posting , @entity28 , a 32 - year - old engineer , appears to confirm that @entity68 spared @entity0 in return for ransom			1
@entity55 press reports have said the fee was paid with the help of a private security firm			2
she writes : ' on thursday , june 19 , 2014 , my little brother , @entity75 , was released after 13 tough months as a hostage in @entity78			1
' due to the circumstances , @entity0 did not go public ( about this ) , which is why i have chosen to do so on his behalf			2
' a secret collection , started by @entity0 's family and friends , allowed @entity0 's release			2
' unfortunately , the total cost to get @entity0 released proved to be higher than the amount already collected			0
@entity0 is therefore obliged to ask for an extra helping hand , so he is not left alone with debts of around 1 million kroner ( £ 86,000 )			1
' throughout this collection , we have used the motto ' many small , makes a big river ' and the hope is that many small contributions can make a big difference , so @entity0 can concentrate on getting back to life in the best possible way and without for the rest of that life having to contend with overwhelming debts on top of the psychological challenges			1
' @entity12 journalist @entity47 was apparently beheaded in a video released on september 2 , while former @entity13 taxi driver @entity50 was killed at the beginning of october the @entity107 alleged yesterday that @entity0 was freed suddenly after his family ' cobbled together a multimillion - euro ransom			1
' a @entity55 newspaper , @entity111 , estimated the amount at about £ 1.3 million			0
in an exclusive interview with @entity60 , @entity28 confirmed that @entity0 is drowning in debt			1
as of october 17 , the @entity7 appeal has brought in only about £ 25,300 towards the £ 86,000 shortfall			0
' i do not have much confidence in getting there			0
i actually do n't think we can collect as much , ' she said			0
@entity0 was kidnapped just three days after he went to @entity78 , where he planned to photograph the suffering of refugees from the civil war			1
last spring , the militants shot dead a @entity126 who was one of his fellow hostages , @entity127			0
' they filmed his body			0
then they returned to show the footage to the surviving hostages , ' the @entity107 reported			0
@entity0 also is said to have witnessed the torture of another cellmate , @entity45 , who was waterboarded and subjected to mock executions			1
@entity135 , @entity0 's older sister , is co-ordinating a @entity7 campaign to raise money to repay the debts he has incurred by apparently paying off a ransom to @entity1 after his release , he telephoned mr @entity45 's mother , @entity142 , to pass on a letter that the despairing @entity12 had asked him to memorise			1
mrs @entity144 visited @entity145 to meet him			0
just a week later , @entity45 became the first hostage to be beheaded on camera by the masked @entity148 known as @entity14			2
in a grief stricken tv interview , she said that the @entity21 administration threatened to prosecute her family if they paid ransom for him			0
a spokesman for the @entity47 family claimed they received similar threats			0
president @entity21 's chief of staff , @entity158 , said that under a @entity12 counterterrorism law , it would have been illegal to for either family to have paid the group money			0
' we did n't threaten anybody , but we made clear what the law is , ' he said			0
a @entity58 spokesperson told @entity60 that the @entity13 has a similar law			2
' the @entity13 @entity170 's policy of not making or facilitating substantive concessions to hostage - takers , including the payment of ransoms , is long standing and clear , ' he said			0
' not paying ransoms to terrorists prevents millions of pounds reaching terrorists			0
ransoms fuel the cycle of terrorist violence and encourage further kidnappings			0
' photographer @entity0 was held for 13 months but is one of the few @entity1 hostages to be released thanks to a secret fund that his family and friends contributed to he added : ' in the case of terrorist kidnaps , it is illegal to pay ransoms to terrorists under @entity13 and international law			1
' a @entity22 administration insider elaborated that under two @entity196 resolutions – the most recent of which was affirmed in 2012 – it is illegal for member states , including @entity55 , to pay ransom to @entity68			2
@entity55 has an ' obligation , ' the insider claimed , to enforce this law and ' prevent terrorists from benefiting directly or indirectly from ransom payments			1
' @entity28 declined to comment when asked if the @entity55 government had given its blessing to the payment that secured her brother 's release			0
the senior public diplomacy and press attache for @entity55 's @entity212 refused to respond to @entity60 's questions about whether ransom money was illegally paid by @entity0 's family , saying ' as a matter of principle , the @entity55 authorities do not comment on hostage cases			1
' she added : ' the @entity55 government does not negotiate with hostage - takers and does not pay ransoms			0

@entity0 was held for 13 months by @entity224 in @entity78 desert
kept *captive* with beheaded hostages @entity45 and @entity47
he ' still struggles to make sense of the violence he has experienced '
but now faces debt of up to *1million* @entity55 kroner after paying ransom
and @entity13 says he has broken the law by handing over cash for freedom
