click here to view all the stats and graphics from @entity3 as they hunted for arsonists and pitch invaders at @entity3 , @entity4 may have unearthed something far more valuable to @entity8 : a turning point for the season			0
most teams in the @entity12 are searching for the same thing , such is the inconsistency around the country , but the @entity4 boss has conjured his third wins in eight days			1
and this one seemed more significant than those against @entity20 and 10 - man @entity21			2
this was a team proving to their manager they had spirit to respond after going behind early to a goal by @entity29			1

att : 35 , 901 ref : @entity110 7 ( @entity111 ) click here to read the detailed player ratings super stat : this was @entity35 ’s third goal from open play in 35 @entity12 appearances since his £ 26million move from @entity120			1
he also has four penalties			0
they displayed great desire and energy in midfield to reverse the flow of the game and the grit to defend once @entity50 and @entity35 had turned it upside down			1
for @entity35 it was his first @entity12 goal since march , and for @entity4 a third home - win of the league campaign with three @entity133 graduates in their starting line - up			1
that trio : @entity54 , @entity81 and @entity82 contributed greatly to the tempo and industry which underpinned a victory and eased @entity4 up to seventh , level with @entity140			1
there was a slice of fortune when @entity78 used an arm to block a goal - bound header from @entity102 during a frantic closing phase , and it went unnoticed , much to the annoyance of @entity74			2
' @entity78 makes himself really big and closes his eyes and he ’s in a unusual position when it hits him , ' fumed @entity74			0
' if it hits him in the chest , no complaints , but it hits him in the arm and it should have been a penalty			0
' i ’m disappointed because @entity110 is a very good referee			0
it ’s a real shame			0
this season , we have n’t been rewarded for good performances at @entity160 , @entity161 and here			0
there are points we need to get back			2
but i would never blame a third party or the referee			0
we should be good enough to come to @entity3 and rely on ourselves			0
' @entity74 had seen his team take control in the 15th minute , with a beautiful curling shot by @entity29 when @entity4 failed to clear a free - kick swung over from the left by @entity95			1
@entity81 headed out but only to the edge of the penalty area where @entity35 lost a duel with @entity29 , who promptly set the ball on his right foot and bent a shot into the far corner			1
@entity32 might have been ahead earlier in the game when a @entity179 - style dribble by @entity101 was smothered on the edge of the penalty box , only for the ball to spill to the feet of @entity102 in front of goal			1
@entity102 , wanted by @entity4 when he left @entity185 in the summer , might have been offside but the flag stayed down			0
he hurried his shot and @entity67 saved without fuss			2
spurs reacted well with great energy from their home - grown trio and were level within six minutes			1
again it was a delightful finish , this time by @entity50 , but the goal owed much to @entity54 ’s determination to threaten the goal			1
@entity54 who cut in from wide on the @entity4 right , into space cleverly vacated by @entity35 and unleashed an effort which took a slight deflection and flashed across the slick surface			1
@entity40 could not hold it and @entity50 was first onto the rebound , clipping a skilful finish over the @entity32 goalkeeper and @entity97 who had made ground to cover on the goal line			1
@entity54 was instrumental for @entity4 , particularly in the first - half as his hard work earned @entity4 their two goals @entity54 's heat map after a superb performance from the young @entity212 forward - click here for more heat maps from the @entity216 service @entity50 has an attempt from a free - kick in the second half as @entity4 looked to build on their lead @entity95 whips in a free - kick in the second half for @entity32 , with @entity4 hanging on in the latter stages @entity32 defender @entity92 goes close in the second half , striking wide at the far post with @entity67 stranded @entity67 claims the ball as @entity4 held on for a vital three points at @entity3 , their first win at home since early october @entity231 miles @entity4 121.6 75.5 @entity54 90 13.0 8.1 @entity81 90 12.9 8.0 @entity50 90 12.7 7.9 @entity32 112.1 69.7 @entity96 90 12.1 7.5 @entity97 90 12.0 7.5 @entity92 90 11.4 7.1 spurs dominated until half - time with patches of attractive football			1
@entity40 thwarted @entity81 and @entity54 , while @entity50 went close with a deflected shot			1
then a poor header by @entity96 , intended for his goalkeeper , fell short			0
@entity35 had anticipated the error but his touch did not match his instinct and @entity96 escaped			2
it seemed like it might be another of those days for @entity4 ’s £ 26million @entity38 : culpable in @entity32 ’s opener and able to do little right at the other end , when he struck , in first - half stoppage time			1
@entity54 caught @entity97 deep in his own half , dithering in possession , and hooked the ball from him			1
@entity74 wanted a free - kick but it would have been harsh			2
@entity43 played in @entity35 and this time his finish was clinical , past @entity40 and inside the post			1
@entity35 has managed to remain dignified through his months of struggle in @entity255 and supporters have refused to turn on him			2
as he headed down the tunnel at half - time , his name was ringing around @entity3			1
' the striker who does n’t score is frustrated , ' said @entity8			0
' it ’s not easy and he felt the pressure but now he is happier and more free			0
it ’s important to the team			0
' although they rode their luck at times , @entity32 stirred and summoned a bold finish , with @entity101 proving increasingly influential			2
@entity8 's ( right ) @entity4 are now seventh in the @entity12 , three points above @entity74 's @entity32 in tenth @entity270 throws the kitchen sink in with a high foot in a challenge with @entity32 's @entity101 @entity4 defender @entity80 looks to evade the attention of @entity32 midfielder @entity98 in the second half @entity276 striker @entity35 misses an attempt with a header in the second half at @entity3 @entity82 of @entity4 and @entity70 forward @entity29 compete for the ball in the first half at @entity3 @entity67 made terrific save to block from @entity92 after one of @entity101 ’s passes			1
then came the penalty appeal for a @entity78 handball , but @entity4 clung on and were cheered off by fans who have been critical at times this season			0
' i understand why our supporters have been angry , ' said @entity8			0
' if you lose four at home , it is difficult for them to be happy			0
you win away and lose at home is not the right way			2
but today the team have sent a different signal			0
we played in good style			0
we must keep this feeling and mentality			0
' this is the aggression we want			0
it was important to get this victory			0
for me , it ’s not only three points - it ’s a little bit more			2
' @entity31 's @entity311 gives his verdict on the refereeing talking points at @entity3 ' @entity110 had two big penalty calls in the closing minutes			0
' the first , with current interpretation should have been a spot kick for @entity32 as @entity78 handled , the ball hitting his arm with the defender in an unnatural position			2
@entity78 ( 21 ) appears to handle the ball inside the area from @entity102 's header late on at @entity3 @entity32 had a right to feel aggrieved that they were n't awarded a penalty , with @entity78 clearly handling ' minutes later @entity54 was through and went down under a challenge from @entity96			1
' watching replays i could not tell whose leg had tripped whose so waving appeals away was the only sensible option for @entity110			0
' @entity54 goes down under the challenge of @entity335 late on , but referee @entity110 waved play on at @entity3 @entity4 's @entity78 shields the ball as @entity29 looks to nip it off him in midfielder @entity101 goes on a run through the @entity4 midfield in the first half , but @entity32 's lead diminished before half - time @entity54 is brought down by @entity32 midfielder @entity96 in the centre of the park at @entity3			1

@entity32 took the lead through @entity29 , firing home a superb effort from the edge of the box
spurs levelled through @entity50 , who converted a rebound after @entity40 saved from @entity54
@entity35 , without a league goal since march , slotted past @entity40 just before half - time to make it 2 - 1
the win puts @entity362 seventh in the @entity12 , three points above @entity32 who sit in tenth
