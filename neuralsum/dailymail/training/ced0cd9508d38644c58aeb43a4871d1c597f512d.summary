@entity0 has insisted that he already has other striker options lined up should @entity2 not agree a permanent switch to @entity4			1
the @entity6 club are thought to have some interest in @entity8 forward @entity9 , but sources have played down reports in @entity12 linking the club with a £ 1.5million offer			1
@entity0 is still optimistic that a deal can be done to keep @entity2 at the end of his season - long loan from @entity18			1
@entity2 has failed to score for the @entity20 champions in six matches but his confidence remains high but he has also told the 22 - year - old @entity23 that he is not the only name in the frame to strengthen their attacking options going forward			1
‘ @entity4 also has options , it ’s not all one - way , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ we have to work to get @entity2 , but he also has to be happy that we want him			0
it works two ways , always			0
‘ playing at @entity4 is a big thing and you can see that with other players who want to play for us			0
@entity4 boss @entity0 has looked at other options should @entity2 not agree a permanent switch ‘ we have to look at different options if it does n’t happen , but , hopefully , it happens and i ’m positive we can do it			2
‘ do i have other options ? yes , but anyway @entity2 is going to be here until the end of the season , so it ’s not like we are losing him on february 1			0
’ @entity2 made a stunning start to life in @entity51 with 11 goals in his first 12 games , but then endured a five - game blank streak that saw him drop to the bench for @entity4 ’s 2 - 0 @entity58 win against @entity59 12 days ago			1
the @entity6 club are thought to have some interest in @entity8 forward @entity9 ( centre ) however , speaking during last week ’s training camp in @entity66 , the 22 - year - old dismissed talk of any crisis of confidence			1
instead , he boldly set his sights on becoming the first @entity4 player to score a hat - trick against @entity73 in 41 years when the clubs meet in a @entity75 semi-final at @entity77 a fortnight on sunday			2
@entity9 , meanwhile , is also reported to have attracted interest from @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82			0
it is claimed the 25 - year - old is valued at around £ 1.75million .			0

@entity2 is on a season - long loan from @entity18
@entity4 may be interested in @entity8 forward @entity9
@entity2 scored 11 goals in his first 12 games for @entity4
but the @entity23 forward has now failed to score in six matches for the club
