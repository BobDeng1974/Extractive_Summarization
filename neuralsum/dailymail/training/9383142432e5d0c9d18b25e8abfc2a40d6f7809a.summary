risk : the @entity2 watchdog claims eating brown toast could put you at higher risk of getting cancer it 's enough to make you choke on your marmalade			1
an @entity2 watchdog says toast , that most @entity13 of breakfast delicacies , should be eaten only when it is a light yellow colour – not an appetising brown			1
and heaven forbid if you prefer your toast – whisper it – burned ! the new warning from the @entity21 is designed to highlight the dangers of the chemical acrylamide , which forms in certain foods cooked at high temperatures			1
putting health and safety high on our daily menus , the @entity2 ’s experts are also advising consumers not to eat dark , crunchy chips and crisps or to drink instant coffee – because of an increased risk of cancer			1
the chemical is mainly found in crisps , savoury snacks , chips , soft and crispy breads , biscuits , crackers , cakes , cereals and coffee			2
but more of @entity13 ’s most beloved foods – such as crispy , dark roasted potatoes and jacket potatoes – could be affected as home cooks are urged to boil , steam or sautee potatoes instead of frying and roasting them			1
food manufacturers and catering outlets have already been improving processes to reduce acrylamide but the watchdog is anxious home cooks across @entity62 should also minimise the risks			0
consuming too much acrylamide has been linked to an increased risk of cancer for years but this is the first time @entity68 scientists have studied the data and issued warnings to consumers			1
their draft opinion states : ‘ laboratory tests show acrylamide in the diet causes cancer in animals			0
scientists conclude that acrylamide in food potentially increases the cancer risk for consumers of all ages			1
’ the chemical forms only in starchy foods – not burned or grilled meat , for example – when they are baked , fried or roasted in temperatures above @entity89 to @entity90 ( 248f to @entity91 )			1
this causes a process known as the @entity95 reaction which browns the food , makes it crispy and crunchy and adds taste			0
but it also creates acrylamide which forms another substance known as glycidamide			2
dr @entity103 , who heads @entity21 ’s expert committee on contaminants in food , said : ‘ @entity107 is the most likely cause of gene mutations and tumours seen in animal studies			0
’ advice : the @entity21 is offering advice on how to make toast without risk an @entity21 spokesman said : ‘ we have published an infographic about acrylamide in food on our website to raise awareness among consumers throughout @entity62			2
’ @entity13 ’s @entity124 already samples food products for acrylamide and levels have been decreasing			2
out of 544 tests last year , only 17 products had higher levels of the chemical			0
but these included popular items such as @entity135 ’s own - brand ready salted crisps , @entity137 ’s wholegrain bran flakes , @entity138 salted snack biscuits and @entity141 extra wheatgerm crackers			0
an @entity124 spokesman said : ‘ consumers are not advised to stop eating any of the foods which are known to contain acrylamide but to follow @entity147 advice on a healthy , balanced diet to minimise exposure			0
’ @entity150 , of @entity151 , said : ‘ while studies have shown acrylamide to cause cancer in mice and rats , research involving people is far less conclusive , and there is n’t good evidence of a link			0

watchdog is warning about acrylamide - substance linked to cancer risk
chemical forms in starchy foods baked , fried or roasted at high temperature
urging people not to eat dark chips , dark toast or drink instant coffee
means many @entity13 favourites , such as roast and jacket potatoes , fall into danger *category*
