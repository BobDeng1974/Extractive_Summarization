by @entity0 published : 15:08 est , 20 april 2012 updated : 12:26 est , 21 april 2012 it could be the plot from a @entity3 movie : after exhausting the @entity6 's supply of natural resources , global corporations turn to space to replenish their stockpile of raw materials			1
however the stuff of science fiction could soon become a reality following the revelation of proposals to begin mining asteroids to guarantee the human race 's prosperity			2
a team of scientists are to unveil plans for the new space venture - and the project has the backing of @entity3 film maker and explorer @entity26			1
details of the proposed space mission are to be officially launched on tuesday , by start - up company @entity44			2
the proposals will be unveiled at a press conference at the @entity47 in @entity48 which will also be available to view online			0
the company 's objectives are to be twofold : the mining of natural resources and space exploration , with the aim of selling the raw materials it extracts from the asteroids and adding trillions of dollars to the global gdp			1
backing : film maker and explorer @entity26 ( left ) is supporting the project , as is billionaire @entity63 ( right ) untapped resource : @entity66 scientists say the high concentration of raw materials found in asteroids could supply @entity6 with vital stockpiles of natural resources space man : entrepreneur @entity73 the shortage of sources for raw materials on the planet has caused global inflation to spike in recent years causing tensions to rise between nations , experts have said			1
@entity66 scientists say the high concentration of raw materials found in asteroids - such as ingredients for fuel and precious metals like iron and platinum - could supply @entity6 with vital stockpiles of natural resources			1
space entrepreneurs @entity73 and @entity91 are just two of the names behind @entity93			2
in a press release , the company announced its intentions to create ' a new industry in space and a new definition of natural resources '			1
@entity73 and @entity91 - both known for their aspirations for commercial space exploration - will host the launch event along with two former @entity66 officials			2
a driving force behind the @entity108 competition to spur on non-goverment space flight , @entity73 has made no secret of his goal to one day become an asteroid miner			0
in an interview earlier this year with @entity114 , he said : ' the earth is a crumb in a supermarket of resources			0
' now we finally have the technology to extract resources outside earth for the benefit of humanity without having to rape and pillage our planet			1
' @entity3 film maker @entity26 is no stranger to daring exploration			0
just last month the director of @entity130 and @entity131 became the first solo diver to reach the bottom of the @entity134 - the deepest point on @entity6			1
radical concept , but old idea : experts believe it is only now that we have the ability to discover and characterise a sufficient number of small near - @entity6 asteroids straight out of a sci - fi film : a scene from the movie @entity146 , where @entity149 's character is sent into space to mine an asteroid before it hits the @entity6 it might seem like a radical concept , but scientists have been toying with the idea of mining asteroids for their natural resources for longer than the space program has been running			1
experts believe it is only now that we have the technology and ability to discover and characterise a sufficient number of small near - earth asteroids ( @entity167 )			0
the mining could yield a large amount of water - frozen inside the asteroids - oxygen and metals which could not only be brought back to @entity6 but could help further space exploration by allowing humans to fuel spacecraft and build space stations			1
@entity66 believes capturing placing an @entity167 in lunar orbit could provide a unique , meaningful and easy - to - reach destination for exploration by astronaut crews in the next decade			0
it is only now that the sufficiently - powerful electric propulsion systems necessary to transport a captured @entity167 are becoming available			0
mining asteroids could take several forms			0
this includes sending humans in a spacecraft to an asteroid to explore and mine it			0
another possible scenario could involve launching a robotic spacecraft to either to mine an asteroid directly or transport it closer to @entity6 so it could be reached by humans more easily			2
extracting raw materials , such as iron and nickel , from the space rocks is a possibility that has been discussed for decades			1
however , the obstacles for such a mission has always been the cost , sufficient scientific expertise and technical prowess			0
it could cost tens of billions of dollars - and could take well over a decade - for astronauts to successfully land on an asteroid , @entity66 experts have said in the past			0
source : the @entity212 now watch the video			0

scientists *due* to unveil plans to extract raw materials from space rocks
mining could replenish stocks of natural resources running low on @entity6
