the authoritative study , @entity26 , was published as @entity28 provoked criticism by urging the @entity30 to do more to tackle @entity32 extremism			0
critics said the cost of the 2003 invasion of @entity8 and sending thousands of troops to @entity37 in @entity9 in 2006 - around £ 30billion and 627 lives lost - was simply not worth the results			1
last night @entity40 , 63 , the father of @entity41 corporal @entity41 , who was murdered by a mob in @entity8 in 2003 , said : ‘ it is disgusting			2

it had left @entity3 open to homegrown attacks such as the july 7 @entity25 bombings in 2005 ( pictured ) the study calculated the cost of @entity3 military interventions after the collapse of @entity65 , from the first @entity66 in 1990 - 91 to the ongoing conflict in @entity9 and @entity68 training missions last year , from @entity71 freedom of information responses			1
the bill for military action in the past 24 years was £ 34.7billion			0

another £ 1.5billion was spent in @entity87 and £ 1.1billion in @entity88 on peacekeeping missions and £ 238million on the war in @entity91			0
the figures do not include what the @entity93 would have been spending on usual running costs such as training exercises , fuel , accommodation and pay			0
the study also estimates another £ 30billion may have to be spent on long - term care for war veterans and compensation payments for deaths and injuries could add another £ 7billion - bringing the total cost to £ 71.7billion			0

interventions in the first @entity66 , @entity109 in 2000 and the start of operations in @entity9 in 2001 which drove out @entity112 and the @entity114 leadership were among those praised			2
