horrified vets that found the poor animal described the dog 's ordeal as the ‘ worst case ’ of neglect they have ever seen			1
the elderly animal - which was extremely skinny - was abandoned outside a vets in @entity22 , south @entity23			1
the matted hair had led to agonising eye ulcers , which had caused her to go blind in both eyes			1
she also had a mouth full of rotten teeth , damp feet from standing in her own excrement and was severely malnourished			1
@entity49 , 35 , who works at @entity50 , said : ‘ we were all horrified by what we saw when we opened the box - it was extremely upsetting to see			2
‘ it ’s definitely the worst case of neglect any of us have ever witnessed in our entire careers , it ’s just unimaginable how anybody could do this to a defenceless , elderly animal			0
’ the pooch , thought to be between eight and 13 - years - old , was found by staff at around 8am on the morning of april 28 - and it is thought she had been dumped some time after 12pm on the sunday			2
saved : @entity64 with princess @entity27 the poodle , who is now recovering well she was immediately rushed inside , washed , trimmed , and fed - up on regular dog food			1
sadly , her eyes were so badly damaged that vets decided they would have to be removed entirely			0
three days after her arrival - and once she had been ‘ fed up ’ with lots of dog food and treats - she had both eyes removed and her eyelids sewn shut , as well as having her 32 rotten teeth removed			1
@entity77 was so upset by what had happened to the dog - now named princess @entity27 - that she has been fostering her			0
@entity64 said : ‘ she is such a sweetie and all the staff were so upset by what has happened to her - but she is doing amazingly well despite her ordeal			0
new beginning : vet ms @entity64 said princess @entity27 is ' doing amazingly well despite her ordeal ' ‘ it is clear the dog had been in this condition for a while and the hair over her eyes was so matted that both eyes had ulcerated causing blindness			2
’ the incident has been reported to the @entity1 and inspector @entity93 is now looking into it			0
she said : ‘ it is horrific to think this poor elderly girl has been left in such a terrible condition and she must have been in so much pain			0
‘ there is simply no excuse for allowing an animal to get in this way and i am now appealing to anyone who has any information regarding who the owner may be			0
