by @entity0 last updated at 10:01 pm on 21st january 2012 taxpayers face a £ 1 billion bill to shore up the @entity3 against chronic subsidence , which is already causing @entity5 to lean alarmingly			2
the problem is so severe that mps are even being asked to consider the radical proposal of selling off the historic building and moving into newly built offices – a move that could net £ 500 million for the exchequer			1
although politicians are unlikely to agree to abandon a site that has been the seat of power for about 1,000 years , the fact that commons speaker @entity14 has floated the idea indicates the scale of the problem			1
work needed : taxpayers face a £ 1billion bill to shore up the @entity3 against chronic subsidence mps will hold a crisis meeting tomorrow to consider the options			2
the all - party @entity28 , chaired by mr @entity14 , will be shown surveyors ’ reports detailing the risk of sinking into the @entity33 mud , electrical problems , fire risks and multiple safety hazards			1
even the boilers , dating from before the @entity38 , are said to be ‘ ready to blow ’			2
repairs to the building , which would have to start by the end of the decade , would take at least five years to complete , with large sections sealed off on a rolling basis and @entity25 and their staff moving into temporary offices			1
even the @entity47 would have to be abandoned for at least two years			1
one insider said the mock - @entity50 building was ‘ an elegant disaster ’ that is ‘ sinking into the mud ’			1
he said : ‘ the accountants argue it is not logical to spend £ 1 billion to repair an estate that is worth £ 1 billion			2
radical : commons speaker @entity14 , pictured here with wife @entity57 , is asking mps to consider selling off the @entity3 ‘ so the stark choice is to spend the money and look extravagant , or to abandon one of the most iconic buildings in the world and sell it to the @entity65 or @entity66			0
’ the worst problems are linked to subsidence caused by decades of tube trains rattling past the foundations and work on the underground commons car park			0
these have caused @entity5 ’s bell tower to tilt 18 in from the vertical – enough for tourists to start noticing			0
cracks have also started to appear in the walls of the @entity79			0
moving mps would cause headaches			0
options include using the @entity83 , as happened during the @entity38 when a bomb destroyed the @entity47 chamber , or relocating to a secret emergency base that is ready for use in the event of a terrorist attack			0
treasury rules on the use of public money oblige mps to consider even the most ‘ radical options ’ , and selling @entity95 would make sense in simple financial terms			1
the site could be sold to a developer as a heritage site for £ 1 billion , while a replacement could be built elsewhere for £ 500 million – roughly the final cost of the over-budget @entity95 in @entity103 , @entity104 , at 2012 prices			1
mr @entity14 ’s advisers point to the @entity108 ’s @entity107 on the use of public money , which says that all ‘ radical options ’ on property development should be considered including ‘ changing locations or sites ’			0
the guidelines add : ‘ these options may not become part of the formal appraisal , but can be helpful to test the parameters of feasible solutions			0
well - run brainstorming sessions can help generate such a range of ideas			0
’ repair work needed : the subsidence problem is causing @entity5 to lean alarmingly the first palace to be built in @entity3 was used as the primary @entity127 residence for the @entity128			0
the @entity47 first assembled there in 1213 when non-baronial representatives of the people were summoned to give their consent to tax laws			0
the present building was erected between 1840 and 1870			1
last night , a @entity47 spokesman confirmed that the sale of @entity95 was included among the proposals , but pointed out that as the building was listed , it was a ‘ complicated ’ option			1
‘ any large future project would follow normal public - sector guidance on costing and the evaluation of all feasible options , ’ he said			0
‘ the @entity144 will be considering whether to ask officials from both houses to undertake a study into the long - term approach to the maintenance of @entity95			1
‘ no decisions are likely to be made for several years as to whether either @entity28 will need to move out of the @entity79 for a period to allow essential work to take place			2

repairs to the houses of @entity95 would take five years to complete
