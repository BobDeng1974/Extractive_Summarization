but then the home side started to stamp their league superiority on the game and equalised in the 33rd minute			1
a ball into the box by @entity122 , playing the unusual role of right - back , caused havoc amongst @entity8 ’s defence and @entity32 snuck in to lob @entity8 goalkeeper @entity60 from close range			1
from then on , @entity11 dominated			2
before the goal , @entity60 used his feet to deny @entity130 when through on goal and dived to keep out @entity122 ’s free kick which was curling into the bottom left corner			0
