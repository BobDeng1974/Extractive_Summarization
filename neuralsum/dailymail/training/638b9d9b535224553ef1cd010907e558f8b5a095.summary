by @entity0 for @entity1 two satellites being used in a £ 4.4bn @entity4 project to develop a satellite navigation system which rivals the @entity7 gps network have gone into the wrong orbit			1
@entity9 , the company responsible for the launch , said the satellites ' had been placed on a lower orbit than expected ' , after being fired into space yesterday on a @entity17 - made @entity16 rocket from @entity18			1
the @entity19 said space officials are now investigating whether the mistake will complicate their efforts to develop the publicly - funded @entity24 satellite navigation system			1
two satellites being used in a @entity4 project which aims to rival the @entity7 gps satellite navigation system , which were launched from @entity18 on friday , pictured left and right , have gone into the wrong orbit , according to the @entity19 it is not clear whether the satellites will be able to work properly in the different orbit , nor whether the orbits are now able to be corrected			1
the satellites , @entity32 and @entity33 , were fired into space after a 24 - hour delay caused by bad weather			1
they are the fifth and sixth satellites to be launched for the @entity19 ’s geo - positioning network			2
the first two were launched in 2011 , followed by another pair in 2012			0
the latest two satellites were already more than one year behind schedule			0
the £ 4.4bn project , funded and owned by the @entity43 , is intended to provide @entity4 with an independent alternative in case of signal failure on the existing @entity7 global positioning system or on @entity17 ’s glonass system			1
the project will apparently create 15,000 to 20,000 jobs within the @entity43 , according to the @entity19			1
in total , the @entity24 network aims to have 30 operating satellites by 2017			0
@entity9 recently announced it would launch a further 12 satellites from the start of next year			1
the statement did not explain the difference between the satellites ' intended orbits and the one in which it was placed			0
space officials are now investigating whether the inaccurate deployment will complicate efforts to create the new £ 4.4bn @entity24 satellite navigation system the satellites , @entity32 and @entity33 , were the fifth and sixth to be launched for the @entity19 's geo - positioning network , being funded and run by the @entity43			1
the first two were launched in 2011 while another was launched in 2012 @entity69 , president of the @entity18 space agency @entity70 , said the investigation still needed to determine precisely how far off course the satellites were			1
he said @entity19 experts in @entity74 , @entity75 , and @entity76 , @entity77 , were calculating whether small motors inside the satellites would be strong enough to push them into the correct orbit			2
mr @entity69 said the investigation would take ' several days to understand what has happened '			0
he said only then would they be able to see the possible consequences on the launch calendar			0
he called the @entity24 navigation network ' a very complex programme ' and said failures were ' unfortunately part of the life of operations '			0
if the two satellites can not be pushed to the correct altitude above the earth , he said , subsequent satellites launched would have to take up the slack			0
the programme has faced other delays and operational hiccups			0
@entity19 officials said on wednesday they had to reduce the strength of another @entity24 satellite 's signal because of unspecified problems			2
@entity24 is a global navigation satellite system ( @entity105 ) currently being built by the @entity19 on behalf of the @entity43 ( @entity43 )			1
the project , expected to cost the @entity43 £ 4.4bn , aims to create a system which will work with @entity108 and @entity109 , the @entity7 and @entity17 global satellite navigation systems			1
according to the @entity43 , @entity24 - which is named after the @entity112 astronomer @entity111 - will aim to provide an ' alternative high - precision positioning system ' under civilian control			1
it has been designed so @entity4 nations can rely on the system in case either of the existing systems fail , or are disabled by their operators			1
the @entity19 says the system , which will be used to guide cars , run trains and land aircraft , carries more precise atomic clocks than gps and will work at higher latitudes than other positioning systems			2
in theory , the data transmitted by @entity24 should therefore be significantly better than @entity108			2
whereas a position fixed by that signal might have an error of about 10m , @entity24 's designers are aiming for a one metre margin of error once there is full deployment			0
for its operation , @entity24 will use two ground operations centres , near @entity139 in @entity77 and in @entity140 in @entity112			0
in december 2010 , @entity43 ministers in @entity142 voted that @entity143 should be the headquarters of the @entity24 project			1
on 21 october 2011 , the first two of four operational satellites , designed to validate the @entity24 concept in both space and on @entity149 , were fired into space			2
two more followed on 12 october 2012			0
the fully deployed @entity24 system is due to consists of 30 satellites ( 27 of which will operational and three of which are spares ) , positioned in three circular @entity158 ( @entity158 ) planes at 23,222 km altitude above the @entity149			2
the latest launch was about one year behind schedule			0
ongoing running costs , including the renewal of worn out spacecraft , are estimated to be about 800 million euros a year			0
but the @entity43 maintains this expenditure will be outweighed by the economic returns of having improved sat - nav			2
it expects @entity24 to bring significant returns to @entity4 nations through new businesses that use precise location data			0
@entity24 was famously called the ' @entity171 in the sky ' by one @entity174 politician who was infuriated by the price of the project .			0

@entity9 , the company responsible for the launch , said satellites had been placed ' on a lower orbit than expected '
the satellites , @entity32 and @entity33 , were fired into space on @entity17 - made @entity16 rocket from @entity18 yesterday
part of £ 4.4bn @entity43 - funded project to provide @entity4 with alternative system instead of @entity108 and @entity17 's @entity109
officials investigating whether mistake will *affect* system creation - not known whether satellites work in different orbit
