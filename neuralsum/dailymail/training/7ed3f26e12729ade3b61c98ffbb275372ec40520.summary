by @entity0 published : 07:48 est , 4 march 2014 updated : 07:48 est , 4 march 2014 should @entity2 remain in charge of @entity4 ? @entity4 boss @entity2 is not expected to contest a @entity6 charge over his headbutt on @entity9 midfielder @entity8			1
@entity10 understands the 52 - year - old will accept the charge of improper conduct announced on monday after headbutting @entity8 on the touchline at the @entity15 on saturday			1
@entity2 has until 6pm on thursday to respond , and has the right to request a personal hearing to give himself an opportunity to explain his actions			2
@entity2 apologised immediately after the game , which his side won 4 - 1 , but was fined £ 100,000 pounds and handed a formal warning by the @entity24 hours later			1
it is alleged that in the 72nd minute of the fixture , @entity2 was involved in an incident with a @entity9 player that amounted to improper conduct			1
due to the serious violent and / or aggressive nature of the reported behaviour this case has been designated as non-standard			0
@entity2 has until 6pm on thursday 6 march 2014 to respond to the charge			2
he is likely to receive a significant further penalty if he either accepts or is convicted on the @entity6 charge , and that could include a stadium ban			2
however , he will not face criminal charges over the incident with @entity55 having confirmed neither @entity8 nor @entity9 have made a complaint			1
@entity8 is on international duty with the @entity58 , who face @entity60 in @entity61 on wednesday night			1
an @entity6 statement said : ‘ @entity4 manager @entity2 has been charged			1
it is alleged @entity2 was involved in an incident with a @entity9 player that amounted to improper conduct			1
‘ due to the serious violent and / or aggressive nature of the reported behaviour , this case has been designated as non-standard			0
’ his position could be reviewed by club owner @entity72 if the manager is hit with a stadium ban			0
@entity2 did at least discover that he had escaped criminal charges on monday			1
a @entity77 police chief said @entity2 ’s conduct could have been deemed ‘ offensive ’ , but added that no - one had requested that the matter be taken further			1
chief inspector @entity81 said : ‘ having reviewed the circumstances of the incident , it has been agreed that the matter will be dealt with by the @entity6 , rather than considering criminal proceedings			1
‘ there has been no complaint received from either the player involved or @entity9			0
@entity55 will not be taking any further action			0
’ we have been working with the @entity6 and the football club to progress the matter appropriately			2
having reviewed the circumstances of the incident it has been agreed that the matter will be dealt with by the @entity6 rather than considering any criminal proceedings			1
there has been no complaint received from the player involved or @entity9 at this time			0
whilst we appreciate that some people may have found the behaviour displayed at the game on saturday offensive , @entity55 will not be taking any further action			0
' it was only recently that the club dismissed reserve - team coach @entity108 amid allegations that he struck a player , understood to be 19 - year - old defender @entity111 , and the pressure could mount on the club to be just as tough			0
@entity6 chairman @entity114 has already described it as a ‘ serious ’ issue while leading figures in the game have said @entity2 ’s position is ‘ untenable ’			1
when the then @entity121 manager @entity120 was punished for physically confronting the fourth official in the tunnel at @entity124 earlier this season , he was hit with a five - game stadium ban			0
a 10 - game ban for @entity2 would see him miss the rest of the season with matchday duties switching to assistants @entity131 and @entity132 , leaving @entity4 owner @entity72 looking at the long - term repercussions			1
the controversial owner , who gave @entity2 an eight - year deal last season , is understood to have acted swiftly on saturday evening in an attempt to draw a line under the incident and end speculation that he intends to sack @entity141			1
but @entity72 holds a review of all aspects of the club at the end of every season and @entity2 ’s behaviour is certain to come under scrutiny despite him being almost certain to provide the top - half finish which was his target for this season			2
clash : @entity2 reacted in unprecedented fashion to being barged by the @entity152 international scuffle : the incident started after @entity8 pushed @entity2 out of the way with the ball rolling towards him off you go : @entity2 is sent to the stands by referee @entity159 from above : @entity2 ( centre ) looks on from the stands as @entity4 secured a 4 - 1 win opinionated : @entity163 , who managed @entity4 in 2009 , slammed @entity2 for his headbutt @entity4 are disappointed with the actions of its manager @entity2 this afternoon ( saturday , 1st march )			1
his behaviour was unacceptable and is not the behaviour we expect from the manager of @entity4			2
it is most disappointing that this incident has taken the focus away from what was a fantastic performance by the team and an excellent result away from home which leaves the club in eighth place in the @entity180			0
sadly , the headlines tomorrow will not be focused on the result or the efforts of the players , but instead on the actions of our manager			0
@entity2 unreservedly apologised immediately following the game to the player , to @entity9 and its fans , and to the fans of @entity4			1
we have held discussions this evening with @entity2 who has offered his sincere apologies to the @entity9 and it is clear he deeply regrets his actions			2
@entity2 has accepted a formal warning from the @entity9 in relation to his behaviour today and also a @entity9 fine of £ 100,000			1
@entity200 is now drawing a line under this matter and will be making no further comment			0
the @entity4 manager fined himself last month for a foul - mouthed attack on @entity207 manager @entity206			1
at the start of last season he pushed a linesman in the back and was involved in an ugly row with @entity214 boss @entity213 during the @entity215			0
on sunday even @entity216 , the chief executive of the @entity217 , could not defend @entity2			2
@entity216 was keen to stress that the second longest - serving manager in the @entity180 was ‘ extremely sorry ’ , but having spoken to @entity2 , he said : ‘ the buck stops with @entity2			2
it ’s unacceptable , it ’s inappropriate and it ’s insupportable from every perspective			0
not happy : @entity224 took issue with @entity2 's celebrations as @entity227 beat @entity228 1 - 0 in 2006 heated : @entity213 took exception to @entity2 's over-zealous celebrations in the 2011 @entity215 frankly , i was shocked and disgusted by @entity2 ’s incredibly irresponsible action			1
and yet , and even more disturbingly , i was n’t completely surprised			0
@entity2 has a lot of previous , a lengthy list of touchline bust - ups and misbehaviour			2
when manager of @entity238 , i had personal experience of @entity2 ’s touchline impropriety during a play - off semi-final with his then club @entity227			1
i was alarmed , to say the least , by the way he tried to influence the officials			0
he immediately realised the serious error , made sincere apologies to all parties			0
but @entity2 does need to think about how not to put himself in that position again			2
’ @entity2 has said he would have to ‘ sit down and stay out of the way ’ rather than roam his technical area			0
@entity216 nevertheless believes certain issues need to be addressed			0
@entity216 told @entity10 : ‘ we did a technical report last year			0
now we are working on a second report			0
i do n’t mention this now because of @entity2 but because it is an important project			0
' there can be too much traffic in the technical areas and sometimes problems arise because of that			0
' hot water : @entity2 called @entity207 boss @entity206 a ' f * * * * * * old c * * * ' in january best of pals : @entity267 , who has often found himself in trouble for acting out , came out in @entity2 's defence spitting feathers : @entity2 was banned for two matches after pushing a linesman against @entity273 in 2012 room with a view : the @entity4 boss was banished to the @entity277 stands after the push november 2006 : @entity2 had earlier in the year criticised @entity228 boss @entity224 for failing to field an @entity280 player in the @entity282 match against @entity283 and matters came to a head in @entity227 's 1 - 0 win over @entity228			1
then @entity227 boss @entity2 's enthusiastic celebrations appeared to irritate @entity224 , who claimed he was ' provoked in a disrespectful way ' , with the pair having to be kept apart by the fourth official			1
on this occasion , it was the @entity294 boss who was fined by the @entity6 , with @entity2 cleared of all charges			1
march 2012 : in a @entity215 , it perhaps comes as no surprise that the tension boiled over , with @entity2 , now @entity4 boss , clashing with @entity213 following his celebration to @entity302 's late equaliser in a heated match			1
both managers pledged afterwards to keep their emotions in check in future			0
august 2012 : @entity2 came under severe criticism and then afterwards labelled his behaviour ' ridiculous ' when he shoved linesman @entity311 in the @entity24 ' season opener against @entity273 after disagreeing with the official 's decision to award @entity273 a throw - in			0
@entity2 once again apologised for his actions but the @entity6 took a dim view and hit him with a two - match touchline ban and a £ 20,000 fine			1
january 2014 : @entity2 became involved in another touchline row , less than a month after having heated words with @entity323 boss @entity322 , with @entity207 manager @entity206			2
television cameras clearly showed the @entity4 boss launching an expletive - laden volley at the @entity328			2
@entity2 was spared punishment but said later : ' it was a heat of the moment thing , words we always have as managers , to a degree			0
i 've apologised and i 'm fortunate that he 's accepted that			0

@entity2 is *n't* expected to appeal after being charged with improper conduct for headbutting @entity8
@entity341 boss escapes criminal action but will face ' non-standard ' @entity6 action
@entity4 could sack @entity2 if he is unable to manage in coming weeks
the former @entity227 boss was fined £ 100,000 after the incident
