by @entity0 @entity1 seemed a little embarrassed when told he had joined @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 by completing track and field ’s grand slam of @entity8 or @entity9 , world , @entity11 and @entity13 titles			1
‘ i ’m still just @entity17 from the @entity19 council estate in @entity20 , ’ he said following his victory in the @entity15 at @entity16 on thursday			2
‘ but it is the best feeling ever			0
this was what made me not retire after the @entity24 ; the feeling of getting another medal			1
‘ if i did n’t do it , it would haunt me for the rest of my life			0
it is a fantastic feeling to make your country proud			0
’ always on top : @entity1 made it a track and field grand slam at @entity16 with another win wave : @entity1 is still as passionate as ever and his emotion was appreciated by the crowd at @entity16 @entity1 remains the unassuming family man who transforms into a fierce competitor on the track and still remembers to dedicate victory to his son @entity44 , who turned three yesterday			1
athletes can be hesitant to talk about their pride in representing their country for , as sir @entity48 put it , ‘ you ’re not really allowed to support @entity51 now ’ , but not @entity1			2
he is unashamedly patriotic about wearing an @entity51 vest			2
the same applies to representing @entity53 and @entity1 has pledged to try to carry on until the next paralympics in 2016			0
the ‘ @entity55 ’ will be 37 by then ; a far cry from the 17 - year - old who quit athletics after the @entity59 in 1996 , disillusioned by the way paralympic athletes were treated			0
top of the pile : the ' @entity55 ' is looking to terrify opponents at the @entity64 as he 's not finished yet now para-sport events enjoy equal billing at these @entity13			1
the reception @entity1 received was just as passionate as the guttural roar that accompanied @entity72 ’s @entity71 winning silver in the 400m hurdles later that night			0
it was cold , wet and horrible at @entity16 on thursday night and yet it was still @entity1 , in his old - fashioned leather and suede gloves that mean his rivals can not hear him coming before he bursts past them , who had the experience and fitness to navigate the puddles and make a decisive charge for the line with 300m to go			1
easy does it : @entity1 made a late dash in the last 300m to take yet another gold to add to his trophy cabinet wheelchair racing is also a strong , competitive and fascinating sport , with athletes of the calibre of @entity95 ’s 11 - time @entity9 medallist @entity94 in the @entity13 and @entity1 ’s great rival @entity96 at the @entity98 in @entity99 next month			1
and yet , time and time again , @entity1 comes out on top over a range of distances from 400m to the marathon			0
in winning his first @entity13 title , ‘ @entity17 ’ really has cemented his place among the greats			1
bring it on : @entity1 will have his opponents waiting for the day he retires as he leads the field yet again			0

' @entity55 ' now has @entity8 / @entity9 , @entity112 , @entity11 and @entity13 titles which ranks him *alongside* @entity2
he made a decisive charge for the line at @entity16 with 300m to go
it was his first @entity13 title and was dedicated to his son , @entity44
patriotic @entity51 has *vowed* to carry on until the next @entity24
