a picture , believed to be the only image of the @entity3 ironclad , the @entity0 has been revealed to be a fake created in a teenage hoax using a 2ft model			1
@entity7 , from @entity8 , has admitted forging the picture with his brother in the 1980s and placing it in a frame which now holds a picture of his dead dog			1
he then passed on the image on to the @entity16 and the photo became an unofficial part of the ship 's history even though it was never authenticated			1
' he told historians that he did n't have the $ 175 the owner wanted the picture @entity34 handed over to the society was actually a picture of a picture			2
in 1986 he fibbed that he was at a yard sale when he found the photograph in an antique frame			0
inscribed on the back of the frame , he claimed , was ' @entity0			0
' he told historians that he did n't have the $ 175 the owner wanted , so he took a photo of it and then mailed it to historical groups in @entity8			1
@entity7 has now admitted the sham and explained how he falsified the image			1
when he was a teenager in @entity8 , @entity7 , his brother @entity48 and a friend shot a short 8mm movie about the building — and destruction — of the @entity0 in a fictional battle with @entity55 troops			1
for the movie , they built an 18 - foot long boat of plywood and @entity59 , as well as a smaller 2 - foot model			2
they based the design , in part , on his grandfather 's recollections of details passed down by word of mouth through generations of their family			2
@entity7 also used an illustration of the ironclad he found on a postcard			1
to create the fake image @entity7 's younger brother put on a coat and straw hat went out to a marsh with a cane fishing pole and @entity7 took a photo			1
he took another photo of the 2 - foot model and cut out the boat 's image , glued it onto the photo of his brother , then used dirt and glue to create the illusion of a photo faded by age and stained by water or chemicals			1
evidence of the hoax : all elements of the fakery were snapped by @entity7 at one time			1
the small model boat here appears alongside the false picture , polaroids of it and a 1984 copy of @entity103 he bought an old picture frame and beat it up even further			1
he put the photo in it			0
then he drove 120 miles to a yard sale in @entity108 , @entity0 , put the picture down and took a @entity110 of it			0
he laughs now , when he remembers that it had seemed so important that he actually do this at a yard sale , so at least that part would be true			0
' who knows what goes through the mind of a kid , ' he said			0
the @entity120 appealed for information about the picture as it embarked on a project to raise the ironclad @entity7 sent out the photo to historical groups , setting off the sporadic , and fruitless , search for a @entity0 photo that he now says never existed			1
as the @entity120 embarked this year on a $ 14 million project to raise the wreckage of the real @entity0 from the river , archaeologists publicised the image online and in news stories hoping to track down the original photo			0
' wanted : a photo of this @entity137 , ' read the headline above the image on the @entity141 website			0
' there are a lot of characteristics in the photograph that lead us to believe it is the @entity0 , ' @entity142 , the @entity141 archaeologist in charge of raising the ironclad 's remains , said in a february interview			0
' on the other side , there are some skeptics who believe it 's a complete fake			0
' @entity157 , former curator of the @entity158 in @entity159 , @entity0 , said in february that while the original photograph would be needed to confirm if the image was authentic , he believed it was real			2
' most people seem to think so , ' he said			0
' or else it 's an awfully good fake '			0
the peeling gilt frame that once held the disputed photo , is now filled with a portrait of @entity7 's deceased pug , @entity169			2
he never became a successful special effects artist with the exception of the one faked photo			0
