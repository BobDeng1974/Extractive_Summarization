@entity1 manager @entity0 has labelled @entity3 's in - form striker @entity2 a @entity5 threat - but has hinted he would not swap him for his own powerhouse forward @entity7			1
@entity9 powerhouse @entity2 has been back to his best in recent weeks following injury and suspension , grabbing a superb solo winner in @entity3 's victory at @entity15 before scoring possibly an even better goal in the 1 - 1 draw against @entity18 last weekend			1
it has been a long road back for @entity2 who missed six months and the @entity20 after rupturing an @entity21 last march , but @entity22 striker @entity7 has had a profitable 2014 , with his 20 goals making him the top scorer in the @entity25 in the calendar year			1
@entity1 striker @entity7 has scored more @entity25 goals in 2014 than any other player ' they 're both very powerful but have different types of game , ' @entity0 said ahead of @entity3 's @entity5 visit to the @entity34			1
' i would say @entity2 is more mobile , a run - the - channels type and probably covers more yards than @entity7			1
but @entity7 is more effective in what he does			2
' they 're very much quality players and @entity2 's coming into a bit of form now , but i always knew he would			2
' he 's always been a good player , he had that serious injury and it always takes a little bit of time to get back that sharpness			0
' that only comes with games but he 's looking sharp now			0
@entity1 manager @entity0 said that while @entity2 is in impressive form , @entity7 is more effective ' he 's a big threat to us and we 're going to have to deal with it			1
' @entity2 's return following his dismissal against @entity54 at the start of november has coincided with an upturn in @entity3 fortunes , @entity59 's side taking seven points from the last 12 on offer			2
@entity62 is available after having his red card against @entity18 rescinded on tuesday and @entity0 is wary of the visitors even though eighth - placed @entity1 are four places and five points better off than @entity3			1
' they 've got good players all over the pitch attacking-wise and it 's a game where we have to be very much on our toes , ' @entity0 said			0
' look at their last performance against @entity18 and i thought they probably deserved to win the game			0
@entity0 was full of praise for @entity2 but insisted that @entity7 was more effective at what he did ' they 've got a good squad and good players and they will be very dangerous , it 's one we 've got to be wary of			1
' but the way we 've played at home we 've got to be confident of getting on the front foot and try to impose ourself on @entity3			0
' there will be periods in the game where they will test us and we have to be ready for that , but confidence-wise we should be on all cylinders			0
' @entity0 made seven changes for last weekend 's 1 - 0 win at @entity94 and @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 could all return after niggles but the @entity1 boss admits there will be plenty of squad rotation over the festive programme			2
@entity3 's @entity9 striker celebrates after scoring against @entity18 before @entity106 @entity1 hit the road after the @entity3 game with league trips to @entity110 and @entity111 preceding an @entity113 third - round tie at @entity115 strugglers @entity114 on january 3			1
' three away games over this period is a tough ask but that 's why the squad is there , ' @entity0 said			0
' we have to be very strong mentally but i think mentally we 're in a very good place - not just the games but between games and preparation-wise			0
' you 've got to be prepared for everything but the players know what 's coming up , they 've all been through it and realise what it takes			0
' the result at @entity94 is a good start coming into these games and hopefully we 'll get that performance level and some points over this period			0

@entity1 will host @entity3 in the @entity25 on @entity5
@entity9 striker @entity2 has *rediscovered* his form recently
but @entity0 insists he would rather have @entity7 in his team
@entity7 has scored more @entity25 goals in 2014 than anyone else
