in the first half of the @entity3 , @entity0 , @entity1 , was known as the sex tourism capital of @entity5			1
now , a new set of archive images reveals the faces behind that seedy industry			2
recently unearthed mug shots from the @entity0 show the women who were arrested for prostitution and the madams who ran the brothels - commonplace in the @entity1 city then known as a place of debauchery			1
aside from their heavily plucked eyebrows , curled hair and rouged lips , one thing these woman all seem to have in common is a marked air of mischief			0
city of sin : the face of @entity30 , who was arrested in connection with an investigation into prostitution , appears in a collection of 1940s mug shots from the @entity0 archives			1
at the time , the @entity1 city was a nightlife @entity38 and famous for its brothels underground industry : @entity42 , aka mrs @entity43 , was the most powerful madam in @entity0 during @entity44 - then @entity1 's very own @entity45			1
her clients were often the same policemen who arrested her perhaps their knowing looks had to do with the fact that many of the officers who arrested them were crooked cops who were also their very own clients			0
in one image , madam @entity51 ( aka @entity52 ) , who was one of the three most prominent brothel owners in the era , grins slyly in her black cap and leopard print coat			0
another mug shot from the archives is that of @entity42 , known at the time as @entity60 , the most powerful brothel owner in @entity44 - era @entity0			1
@entity63 - who shows off her freckled features and pencil - thin eyebrows in her mug shot - would reportedly arrive at the courthouse for her arrests in a @entity69 , her body wrapped in mink			0
selling sex : madam @entity51 ( aka @entity52 ) , who was one of the three most prominent brothel owners in the era , grins slyly in her black cap and leopard print coat distinctive look : @entity75 , arrested in connection with an investigation into prostitution , has the plucked brows , curled hair and dark painted lips that were considered fashionable in the early 1940s crackdown : @entity82 , who was arrested in 1941 in connection with an investigation into prostitution , also features among the women pictured unimpressed : @entity86 , a maid , was arrested on april 11 , 1940 for keeping a brothel , part of a city - wide effort to crack down on a booming prostitution industry according to @entity92 , @entity0 became a sex tourist destination after @entity94 and during @entity95 , when @entity96 would drive north to fulfill their illicit needs in @entity1			1
not only did the city abound in drinking dens , brothels and gambling houses , but because of its architecture and the language spoken there , it was viewed as an extension of @entity106 , making it something of ' an exotic vacation			0
' but following the end of @entity95 in 1933 , as well as a sudden rise in cases of sexually transmitted disease , @entity0 prostitutes lost their exotic allure and were instead seen as a force of corruption that needed to be stopped - publicly , at least			1
indeed , while raids were frequent and arrests were many in the 1940s , fines were low , and many prostitutes and brothel owners resumed business shortly after their handcuffs were taken off			0
local madam : some addresses that were known to police as brothels were hit often			2
one such location was 1225 bullion , a brothel kept by @entity133			0
in her mug shot , ms @entity133 slouches and stares at the camera disinterestedly , her deep red lips , dark curls and pencil - thin eyebrows on display dual identity : not all these women were prostitutes or madams in the traditional sense ; one image is that of @entity147 , a servant who was arrested in may 1940 for owning a brothel this was most likely another factor that contributed to the women 's seeming nonchalance in their mug shots			2

in may 1942 , @entity168 was also arrested at ms @entity133 ' brothel as part of a police investigation into prostitution			1
@entity174 is undoubtedly one of the most fascinating mug shots ; in it , she bares her teeth in a knowing grin , the corners of her eyes crinkling with mild amusement			0
ready for her close - up : @entity168 , who was arrested in 1942 as part of an investigation in connection with prostitution , is the only woman to smile at the camera			2
perhaps her knowing look had to do with the fact that many of the officers who arrested the sex workers were crooked cops that were also clients busted : @entity194 , who had an alias of @entity196 , was arrested for prostitution in 1941 booming trade : @entity199 was arrested several times between 1941 and 1943 for operating a brothel at 1225 bullion arrested : like @entity199 , @entity202 was also stopped at 1223 @entity201 as part of an investigation in connection with prostitution some of the other women arrested in this era in relation to prostitution include stern - looking brunette @entity82 and @entity30 - a youthful woman with eyebrows drawn so far apart that they lend her an air of sadness			1
@entity216 was arrested in december 1941 for owning two brothels on the same road			0
in her mug shot , dark bags under her eyes and a masculine , disheveled haircut reveal the toll her profession has had on her appearance			0
not all these women were prostitutes or madams in the traditional sense ; one image is that of @entity147 , a servant who was arrested in may 1940 for owning a brothel			2
and @entity86 , a maid , was arrested on april 11 , 1940 for keeping a brothel , part of the city - wide effort to crack down on a booming prostitution industry			1
sex trade : @entity236 , who was arrested in connection with an investigation into prostitution			1
@entity241 's legality in @entity0 has always been a point of contention , but during @entity44 , it was at its most prevalent tough times : @entity216 was arrested in december 1941 for owning two brothels on the same road			1
in her mug shot , dark bags under her eyes and a masculine , disheveled haircut reveal the toll her profession has had on her appearance @entity253 : @entity254 , one of three main madams in @entity0			2
while raids were frequent and arrests were many in the 1940s , fines were low , and many prostitutes and brothel owners resumed business shortly after they were handcuffed			0

@entity0 was the center for sex during @entity95 in the @entity96 , when @entity96 would travel north to fulfil their illicit needs in @entity1
the end of @entity95 as well as a rise in sexually transmitted disease saw police *enforcing* a crackdown on the prostitution industry , during which time these women were put behind bars
