‘ food is n’t theatre and to make it into theatre is wrong , ’ she told the @entity42			1
‘ it can speak for itself and it ’s wonderful and it ’s beautiful and it ’s art – it ’s everything			2
‘ i do n’t think it needs that kind of embellishment			2
our problem is we do n’t think highly enough of it , and so we think we ’ve got to wrap it up in all kinds of other things			0
’ she added : ‘ we ’ve lost our grip on home cooking			2
i can see that by the way kitchen equipment shops are in decline			0

‘ everybody now knows about food from around the world and what chefs do ; but not everybody knows how to make an omelette , ’ she said			1
‘ what is missing is the basics			0
there ’s where i come in ... that ’s what i want to try and do : fill that gap			0
’ miss @entity1 recalled filming her first tv series , @entity98 , in 1973 in a tiny studio			0
‘ the nearest running water was the ladies ’ loo so we used to fill two buckets with water – one with soap , one for rinsing – and have them under the counter where i worked , ’ she said			0
‘ they did n’t have the money for editing so i had to do 25 minutes 40 seconds all in one go ; if i made a mistake i had to start at the top			0
‘ and they did n’t do any close - ups because my hands were shaking too much			0
’ asked whether she would turn down the @entity18 if the broadcaster approached her to work for the corporation again , she said : ‘ i ’d say , “ i ’ll sell you what i ’m doing			0
you can buy it and broadcast it in a five - minute slot ”			0
