@entity0 says son @entity1 would love to play for @entity2 in the future and insists the decision to make himself unavailable for the @entity5 was taken for the good of his career			1
in an exclusive interview with @entity10 , the former @entity2 captain – who has 53 caps – has hit back at claims @entity1 ‘ snubbed ’ his country and that his international career is in ruins			1
@entity17 revealed on thursday that the @entity19 winger – currently on loan at @entity21 – had told him he did not want to be considered for this summer ’s @entity22			1
@entity1 has been left out of the latest @entity2 under 21 squad by @entity17 at his own request @entity0 ( right ) is currently on loan from @entity19 at @entity26 side @entity21 the @entity2 boss said he was ‘ surprised and disappointed ’ following conversations with the 23 - year - old and his father , his former @entity2 team - mate			1
but @entity31 says his son needs a period of rest if he is to get his career in the @entity36 back on track – and that is their prime focus heading into next season			2
‘ @entity1 has played 18 times for the @entity5 and really enjoyed it and found it beneficial – so this is not a snub , that ’s rubbish , ’ said @entity0 , who was @entity2 ’ s first black skipper			1
‘ he is 23 years of age and has already played in the euros in @entity49			2
he has experienced that , which was great			0
‘ if he was 20 years old we would not be having this conversation , he would be going to the @entity48 , no doubt about it			0
‘ but the last year or so from a club point of view has been difficult for him			2
he ’s been all over the place			0
he went to @entity19 last summer and has then been on loan at @entity58 and @entity21 , where he ’s doing well now			1
‘ we forget that he had three years at @entity60 pretty much playing by himself at a young age , and that had an effect			0
‘ he needs to get a good rest and make sure he is ready to go next season			0
he needs to start finding some stability			0
he needs to get himself in a position to play regular football in the @entity36			0
’ @entity2 captain @entity0 has his head bandaged and shirt covered in blood during a @entity73 qualifier against @entity74 in @entity75 in 1997 @entity0 ( right ) played under his father @entity76 while at @entity60 in the championship the aim , then , is to make an impact at the @entity81 next season before bidding for a senior call - up with @entity2			1
‘ listen , @entity1 has not snubbed his country			2
it is the pinnacle of a player ’s career to represent your country , ’ @entity0 added			1
‘ i was captain and am immensely proud of my 53 caps			0
‘ @entity17 said we should be aware of the repercussions			0
if @entity1 is playing regularly next year for @entity19 and scoring goals like he is for @entity21 , then he would love to get an @entity2 call - up			1
‘ and if he is doing that i see no reason why @entity98 should n’t call him up			0
he ’s got a good young squad and @entity1 would love to be part of it in the future			2
‘ but first of all he needs to get his club career in order			2
we have looked at the bigger picture			0
he needs a steady period and he needs to hit the ground running next season			0
@entity0 ( second right ) celebrates with goalscorer @entity110 ( right ) during the @entity112 clash with @entity113 last year @entity17 said @entity0 should be aware of the repercussions following his decision ‘ if he makes his mark at @entity19 next year then hopefully we ’ll see the benefit of this decision			1
‘ so there is no way i ’m saying to @entity1 , “ do n’t play for @entity2 ”			1
as a father i would love my son to do what i did and play for his country			2
‘ there are other kids coming through who are 20 and 21 and they will be at the tournament - @entity1 is 23			1
‘ and do n’t forget he could also be in the play - offs with @entity21 , as he was with @entity60			1
there would be no time for rest			0
‘ we have to be careful and think about the future			0
