thefts involving smartphones have declined dramatically in three major cities since manufacturers began implementing ' kill switches ' that allow the phones to be turned off remotely if they are stolen , authorities said on tuesday			1
the number of stolen iphones dropped by 40 percent in @entity9 and 25 percent in @entity10 in the 12 months after @entity11 added a kill switch to its devices in september 2013			1
in @entity15 , smartphone theft dropped by half , according to an announcement by officials in the three cities			1

versions of the emergency feature are included on @entity33 and @entity21 handsets			2
a ' soft ' kill switch , such as those currently offered , allow a person to block a thief from accessing their phone			1
this lets them disable their handset , add extra layers of security , and protect their personal data on it			0
@entity25 and @entity22 will both add the feature to their next software update			1
current services rely on a signal to be activated , which can be blocked if a thief turns off a phone or puts it in airplane mode straight away			0
' we have made real progress in tackling the smartphone theft epidemic that was affecting many major cities just two years ago , ' said @entity15 mayor @entity59			0
@entity59 , @entity9 district attorney @entity60 and @entity10 state attorney general @entity61 were among numerous officials arguing for new laws mandating the kill switches			1
in @entity66 , where a law mandating kill switches has yet to go into effect , smartphone theft is dropping because some manufacturers have already started installing the software - based switches on the devices they sell , @entity60 said			2
' the wireless industry continues to roll out sophisticated new features , but preventing their own customers from being the target of a violent crime is the coolest technology they can bring to market , ' @entity60 said			0
@entity66 's law , one of the nation 's strongest , received wide support from @entity66 prosecutors and law enforcement agencies that hoped it could help reduce smartphone thefts			0

so far , @entity11 , @entity21 and @entity22 have implemented kill switches on their smartphones , and @entity25 is expected to release an operating system for its @entity28 phones that has one this year , the three officials said in their news release			1
' @entity108 ' : as part of an update to the operating system and the ' @entity113 ' application , @entity33 users will be able to deactivate their devices online but some of the smartphone systems require consumers to opt in , meaning not all will be protected when their phones are operating in the default mode			0
@entity60 , @entity59 and @entity61 called on all manufacturers to make the technology active as a default position , as @entity11 has done with its iphones			2
