a majority of @entity1 who received government subsidies to help pay for their @entity5 insurance policies will have to give some of that money back when they file their tax returns , according to research published tuesday by the tax preparation firm @entity12			1
those taxpayers will owe about $ 530 each , on average , amounting to a 17 per cent decrease in the typical tax refund			0
the @entity17 announced on feb. 9 that nearly 6.5 million people who live in the 37 states covered by its @entity21 website would qualify for an @entity5 tax credit this year since htey ca n't afford to pay the full price for medical insurance			1
that means nationwide more than 4.5 million will see part of their april 15 refunds shaved away , according to a @entity31 analysis			0
tax bite for many : portions of about 4.5 million @entity5 insurance subsidies will have to be paid back this year ' this is what happens when you write 3,000 page laws in the basement with lobbyists and egghead theorists managing the chaos , ' said @entity45 chief @entity44 the tax - prep assistance company based its finding on data collected from its customers during the first six weeks of 2015 , finding that 52 percent of those who got @entity5 subsidies in the form of tax credits will have to refund part of the money to the government			1
' the level of payback of the @entity62 is significant in that it 's costing taxpayers a large percentage of their refund â€“ a refund many of them count on to pay household expenses , ' @entity12 health care and tax services vice president @entity57 said tuesday			0
@entity45 , a conservative group that has long pushed for simpler tax laws and the repeal of the @entity5 , told @entity31 that the hit to @entity1 ' bottom lines is a natural consequence of an unwieldy addition to an already mammoth tax code			1
@entity45 president @entity44 called it ' another @entity5 unpleasant surprise			2
' ' this is what happens when you write 3,000 page laws in the basement with lobbyists and egghead theorists managing the chaos , ' @entity44 said			1
' $ 530 is a slap in the face reminder that " there ai n't no such thing as a free lunch "			0
' when @entity1 first used the chronically troubled @entity21 website to enroll in coverage at the end of 2013 , the @entity91 used their 2012 income to determine how much of a subsidy they would receive			1
but many people earned more in 2013 , and still more in 2014			1
for them , subsidies based on their 2012 incomes would later turn out to be too high			1
' this income underreporting has led to a majority of marketplace - enrolled taxpayers paying back a portion of the tax credit , ' @entity57 said			2
' the average tax refund for these taxpayers was almost $ 3,100 but it was reduced by $ 530 due to the tax credit reconciliation process			0
' @entity44 's group said the people affected by the unexpected tax - day hits to their wallets are law - income earners			1
' higher income taxpayers received no tax subsidy and are n't facing this tax season surprise , ' @entity45 explained			2
' families of four earning less than $ 97,000 are eligible for a credit			0
so is a single mother with two children earning less than $ 80,000 and an unmarried / childless taxpayer earning less than about $ 12,000			0
' families that earn even less are more likely to be enrolled in @entity124 , a taxpayer - funded medical plan whose new enrollees have comprised most of the newly insured under @entity5			1
the @entity127 , which administers the @entity5 tax - credit program and collects taxes on behalf of the @entity130 , is already dealing with a shortage of staff because of budget cuts			2
it 's unclear how that situation will affect the first year 's settling of the @entity5 's tax dust			2
but the @entity127 is already slowing down the program that audits taxpayers ' annual paperwork to recover unpaid or underpaid taxes			0
last year the agency performed the fewest audits in a decade , and this year the number is expected to be even lower			0
' the math is pretty simple , ' @entity127 commissioner @entity145 said tuesday in a speech to the @entity148			0
' there are fewer audits because we have fewer auditors			0

@entity1 who bought @entity5 insurance in 2013 and 2014 based their subsidy *calculations* on their 2012 income levels
more than half of those earned more than they *estimated* , meaning they qualified for a smaller subsidy than what they got
those affected are all lower - income and *middle* - class people who earn too much to qualify for @entity167 but still qualify for subsidies
' this is what happens when you write 3,000 page laws in the basement with lobbyists and egghead theorists managing the chaos , ' a noted *anti-tax* *advocate* said
