@entity0 ended his post-match press conference on a prickly note after being asked about the failings of @entity4 's on loan striker @entity5			1
@entity5 was left as an unused substitute as @entity4 pressed for an equaliser in their @entity9 defeat to @entity10 , but @entity11 was quick to defend his forward			1
the @entity14 manager interrupted a journalist asking about the striker to defend his forward 's record , and hit out at the press for enjoying the @entity21 's dismal record , before ending with a sarcastic remark			2
@entity0 ( left ) trudges away after the defeat , with @entity5 ( right ) walking ahead of him @entity11 was in a bad mood at the press conference , pointing accusingly at a journalist for the question as he left the room the @entity14 sarcastically remarked ' very good question ' , and gave a thumbs up the @entity4 boss decided not to use @entity5 despite chasing an equaliser , keeping the expensive star benched ' he scored four goals and has 3 or 4 assists , so that is his contribution , ' said a clearly annoyed @entity11			1
' and he stimulates also the other players , so that 's also an aspect of the profession			0
' ' but it is now easy for you to say that ( criticism of @entity5 ) , and that 's why you are saying that			0
and you are very happy to say that , i see that in your face			0
' when the journalist then pointed out that four goals is not very much for a striker on £ 280,000 a week , @entity11 seemed to agree , but continued to take issue with the line of questioning			2
the 63 - year - old took issue with the line of inquiry about @entity5 , interrupting a journalist 's question @entity5 has scored four goals since joining on loan , a meagre return for £ 280,000 per week @entity11 issues tactical instructions during the game , but was unable to stem the tide against @entity10 ' yes , ' he responded			1
' i can not change that			0
i can not change facts , and you know that			0
' the @entity4 boss then called an end to his press conference , before leaving with a sarcastic jibe of ' very good question ' to the offending journalist , and giving him the thumbs up .			2
