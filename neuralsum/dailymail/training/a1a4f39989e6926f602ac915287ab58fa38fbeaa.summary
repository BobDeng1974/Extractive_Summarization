the @entity1 , @entity2 , the @entity3 and the @entity4 - we could n't imagine our cities without them			1
but what of the discarded designs that never made it off the drawing board ? how different would our skylines have looked ? @entity12 from @entity13 has unearthed some incredible drawings of great architectural landmarks that failed to get commissioned			1
a proposal for the @entity4 by @entity17 , 1912			1
with no classical tradition within the @entity19 to draw from , @entity17 instead looked towards the @entity20 and @entity21 to create a pyramid proposal for the @entity4 one of the more unusual designs is a drawing put forward by architect @entity17 in 1912			1
with no classical tradition to draw from in the @entity19 , he instead looked towards the @entity20 and @entity21 to create a pyramid proposal for the @entity4 in @entity27			1
some historians believe that @entity17 put forward the zany design because he was n't a fan of the original site chosen for the @entity4			2
they believe it was his last - ditch effort to discourage decision - makers from using the location by briefly presenting his strange pyramid idea , before strongly pitching ideas for other sites in @entity27			0
eighteen years earlier , a number of potential designs for @entity2 were published by @entity40 in 1894 in a book written by @entity42			1
a number of potential designs for @entity2 were published by @entity45 magazine in 1894 among them were three by @entity47			1
he proposed a series of designs for a very high - level bridge that would have allowed shipping to pass beneath all three of @entity55 's designs were rejected as they would have required a huge spiral ramp on the bank of the @entity58 to allow traffic to flow down at a reasonable slope the book , which will today set you back between £ 100 - £ 150 , reveals a number of other potential designs as well as building plans for the bridge and images of its construction			0
among the designs were three put forward by sir @entity47 , chief commissioner to the @entity70 and the architect of @entity73 ’s great sewer			1
all three , however , were rejected because they would have required a huge spiral ramp on the southern bank of the @entity58 to enable traffic to move down at a reasonable angle			0
another design by @entity80 had two moveable platforms at either end of the bridge with a roadway in place at all times , even when ships were passing through			0
another design by @entity80 had two moveable platforms at either end of the bridge with a roadway in place at all times , even when ships were passing through not long after the @entity2 commission , architects in @entity73 started drawing up plans to rival and outdo the @entity1			1
recently uncovered documents revealed how an intense competition was held to find a design for what was to be called the @entity102			0
the winning entry was to be built in @entity104 , @entity73 and was intended to be a centerpiece of a new funfair			2
however the building of the ambitious octagonal structure hit a stumbling block as the project ran out of money after only completing the first floor			0
these pictures show the amazing designs that were submitted by 68 talented architects that were published in a catalogue			2
the winning design , by @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity121 , right , looks similar to the @entity1			2
the winners received a prize of 500 guineas and according to documents was 215 feet taller than the @entity1 these pictures show the amazing designs that were submitted by 68 talented architects that were published in a catalogue			1
some look like carbon copies of the @entity1 itself , while others resemble bizarre structures of the future in 1957 , architect @entity134 participated in the competition for the @entity3 , which he prepared during a brief stay in that city			2
while his entry was unplaced , his drawings were later displayed as part of an exhibition to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the competition			0
other designs that were never built include a masonic temple complex created by @entity146 in 1922 and a drawing the @entity148 with high dome by @entity150 in 1797			0
this image was on display in the @entity154 ’s exhibition , @entity155 ( 2011 - 2012 )			0
in 1957 , architect @entity134 participated in the competition for the @entity3 , which he prepared during a brief stay in that city this proposed @entity158 was created by @entity146 , 1922 - 24			0
the site of this complex was where the @entity161 stands today this design for the @entity19 @entity148 with high dome by @entity150 , c. 1797 was never built			0

one of the most unusual is a pyramid proposal for the @entity4
three failed designs for @entity2 by sir @entity47 are revealed
there is also a catalogue of 68 drawings for a structure in @entity73 to rival the @entity1 in @entity174
