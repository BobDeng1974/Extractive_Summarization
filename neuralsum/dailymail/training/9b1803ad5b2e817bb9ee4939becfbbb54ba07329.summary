some children are simply too naughty to fit into everyday school life , the government ’s behaviour tsar suggested today			2
there is a group of youngsters who behave in very difficult and violent ways and who need much more help and support , according to @entity11			2
he indicated that there may be have been a rise in these types of pupils , many of whom display very bad behaviour from an early age			2
unable to mix : @entity11 said there is a group of youngsters who are simply too naughty to fit into everyday school life ( picture posed by model ) giving evidence to the @entity37 education select committee this morning , mr @entity11 - former headteacher of @entity29 , a special school in west @entity31 for children with behavioural , emotional and social difficulties - said that while behaviour in general is improving , there remains a groups of children that persistently behave poorly			1
he was asked by @entity43 , conservative mp for @entity44 , why it was that increasing numbers of pupils are suspended from school for abuse or assault and , at the same time , @entity53 rates almost four - fifths of schools as good for behaviour			1
worrying : mr @entity11 said there may be have been a rise in these types of pupils , many of whom display very bad behaviour from an early age mr @entity11 replied that the numbers of schools rated as good has fallen from around 87 per cent as the bar has been raised on standards of behaviour			1
he told the committee : ' though i would say generally , the trajectory of behaviour within schools is improving ' it is now rarer in schools to have ' no - go areas where teachers fear to tread at lunchtimes and break times ' , mr @entity11 said			1
' so things have improved			0
' but i do think there ’s a group of children who show very extreme behaviour , very difficult , challenging , violent behaviour , often quite young children , and i would say possibly there has been an increase in those sorts of children			2
' you can still be a school who is good on behaviour and still have pupils like that within your school because you ’re doing a good job with them			0
' but nevertheless there are certainly a group of children who need extra interventions , who need more help , who need more support and for whom the basic standards of just a really well - run school are n’t enough			0
' he added : ' the trajectory is in the right direction , but there ’s a huge amount to carry on doing			0
' mr @entity11 has just been appointed the first chief executive of the @entity112 , which will oversee teacher training			1
mr @entity11 said that he had concerns that some training courses are not teaching would - be teachers enough about behaviour and how to deal with it			1
behaviour expert : @entity11 was the headteacher of @entity29 , a special school in west @entity31 for children with behavioural , emotional and social difficulties , before his government appointment ' sometimes behaviour gets pigeon - holed as a one off lecture at the beginning of the year , ' he said , with a lecturer handing out tips on how to deal with misbehaving pupils			1
mr @entity11 has previously called for disruptive children to be identified before they start school to stop them going ' off the rails ' later on			1
publishing his report into alternative provision earlier this year , mr @entity11 said that intervening to help naughty children when they are as young as two or three is better than ' waiting until they are throwing tables around '			2
teaching unions have previously raised concerns about misbehaving pupils , with a survey by the @entity143 ( @entity143 ) suggesting that poor parenting could be fuelling bad behaviour in schools			0
it revealed that behaviour has worsened in the last five years , with pupils kicking , punching , pushing and shoving school staff			0
@entity143 general secretary dr @entity151 said there is a minority of children who have a ' total disregard of school rules '			0
these youngsters are just as likely to be ' over-indulged ' middle - class children as those from poorer homes , she said			0
@entity53 chief inspector sir @entity161 has also warned that schools are often forced to act as ' surrogate parents ' in a sometimes self - obsessed culture that fails to instil good values in children .			0
