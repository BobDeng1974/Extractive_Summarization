jailed : @entity0 , 22 , from @entity1 , was sentenced to three years for inciting violence during the @entity4 riots a @entity6 user who posted on the social networking site that rioters should ' put @entity4 on the map ' has been jailed for three years			1
@entity0 , from @entity1 , wrote the message when the august riots were at their most fervent , and urged his friends to wreak havoc in the city centre			1
the 22 - year - old , who admitted encouraging the commission of offences of riot and inciting racial hatred , sobbed as the sentence was handed down at @entity21			1
unemployed @entity0 logged on to @entity6 on august 9 under his profile name ' @entity23 ' , at 11.44am posted : ' message to all - we need to start riot ' n we need to put @entity4 on the map , first lets riot king street @entity4 , haha			1
' at that point @entity4 had not yet been targeted by rioters , but shortly afterwards trouble flared up in the city			1
@entity33 , one of the most important thoroughfares of the city and an affluent shopping area , was hit within hours of the message being written , with marauding bands of hooded youths running amok			2
the copycat riots in @entity43 's third - largest city - and nearby @entity1 , where @entity0 lived - also saw widespread looting and vandalism which threatened to stretch police resources to breaking point			1
@entity0 went on to post a string of racist comments about the ethnicity of the rioters and also posted ' bring bk the riots ' on @entity6 in the aftermath of the violence			2
@entity4 @entity21 heard his crime was so serious he would have to go to jail on the spot - and serve a sentence ' measured in years '			1
copycats : looters ran amok in @entity4 in august , in similar scenes witnessed in @entity62 the court heard that @entity0 's remarks could potentially have been seen by his 475 @entity6 ' friends ' and anyone else who stumbled across his page			2
@entity68 , prosecuting , said : ' within hours of the message being posted , rioting did occur in the very place named			2
' in reality we ca n't say any person who saw the message decided to riot because of it , but it was plainly the defendant 's intention and it may well have encouraged some of those who did behave in that way			2
' @entity0 , who has a previous conviction for racially aggravated common assault , was arrested at his home on august 16 , a week after posting the first message			2
arrests : police detain rioters who had been looting a @entity92 supermarket on @entity93 , @entity4 , in august when cautioned he reportedly replied : ' riot ? i wanted to be part of it but i was n't			0
' two other young men , @entity100 and @entity101 , are currently serving four - year sentences for encouraging people to riot in @entity104			1
the pair 's bid to have their jail - time cut by the @entity108 failed earlier this month			1
@entity109 , defending @entity0 , said he had not gone as far as @entity100 and @entity101 , who set up dedicated pages calling for disorder			0
he said @entity0 had ' got caught up in what was going on ' and was remorseful and ashamed			0
sentencing him , judge @entity113 said the disorder in @entity4 was ' simply lawlessness '			0
chaos : a policeman in riot gear stands on @entity118 in @entity4 as a fire , started by rioters , blazes behind him he said of @entity0 's remark : ' even if one or two people had read it and talked about it to others , it had the potential of causing real public mischief			0
' police constable @entity129 added : ' the widespread disorder in @entity131 and @entity1 drew disbelief and shock			1
' everyone witnessed the disgraceful scenes of violence , looting and arson and it is clear that social networking sites were used to incite certain elements of this disorder			0
' at that time , @entity143 vowed that we would identify anyone involved in using social networking sites to stir up hatred , and once @entity0 had been exposed , our team in @entity149 was brought in to investigate			1
' the sheer scale of the disorder meant that teams from across @entity143 were brought in to help bring the offenders to justice			0
' the comments @entity0 posted on @entity6 were clearly designed to incite people to commit disorder in @entity4 just hours before those awful scenes			0
' not content with that , he continued to post racist and inflammatory comments			0
' i hope today 's sentence sends a powerful message to those who choose to follow @entity0 's example and use social networking sites irresponsibly and criminally that they will be dealt with harshly by the courts			0
' constable @entity168 added : ' at the time of the disorder , we made a public pledge to our communities that we would pursue not just those involved in looting , violence or arson , but those who used social networking sites to stir up trouble and encourage others to get involved			0
' the disorder brought shameful scenes to our cities and those who used social networking sites to organise what happened are just as responsible as those who physically took part			0
