being circumcised does not affect a man 's sex life , a landmark study has revealed			0
@entity4 scientists analysed nearly 40 studies and concluded that the procedure had no effect on sensitivity or satisfaction the most scientifically rigorous studies , however , concluded the circumcision had little , if any , effect			1
lead author of the study , professor @entity24 of the @entity25 , told @entity28 : ' this is a ground - breaking article			0
' the health benefits of male circumcision have been well documented , including substantially lower risks of @entity33 and other viral and some bacterial sexually transmitted infections			1
