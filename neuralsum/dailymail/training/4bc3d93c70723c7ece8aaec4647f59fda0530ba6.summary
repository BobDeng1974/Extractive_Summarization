a perfect day for @entity0 and a perfect way to prepare for the biggest night of their season so far			2
@entity4 dropped points , @entity6 lost and @entity8 ’s team scored five in one of the most startlingly one - sided games of the @entity12 season			0
that should not be overlooked			0
@entity0 , though , were terrific and they will now head in to tuesday ’s @entity16 game at home to @entity18 imbued with confidence after scoring nine times in their last two league games			2
@entity22 scored a second - minute penalty to give @entity0 the lead against @entity13 at the @entity25 @entity26 celebrates with his tongue stuck out after doubling @entity0 's lead and effectively ending the game after 12 minutes @entity32 , starting ahead of new signing @entity30 , made it 3 - 0 in the first half and here is congratulated by his team - mates @entity37 offers a wave to the crowd after scoring @entity0 's fourth before adding a fifth moments later with a brilliant driven effort @entity0 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity42 7 ; @entity43 7 , @entity44 8 , @entity45 6 , @entity46 6 ; @entity26 8 ( @entity47 70 mins , 7 ) , @entity48 7 , @entity49 6 , @entity37 8 ( @entity50 59 , 7 ) ; @entity32 9 , @entity22 8 ( @entity30 60 , 7 )			1

@entity37 ( 21 ) played a key role in @entity26 's goal to put @entity0 2 - 0 up at the @entity25			1
click here for more match zone @entity0 have been here before , of course			2
this time last year they prepared for a game against the @entity90 club by beating @entity4			0
three days later they got a right old chasing			0
this felt different to that , though			0
this game had the feeling of a team moving through the gears ahead of greater challenges to come			0
as odd as it sounds , the @entity99 champions won this game with something in reserve			0
a penalty in the second minute from @entity22 was certainly the perfect start for @entity0			1
after that they found a way through what can generously be called the @entity13 defence with ease			0
@entity26 and @entity32 contributed quite exquisite goals before half - time and two @entity37 goals early in the second period had @entity13 hanging on for full - time with well over half an hour remaining			1
a @entity0 sign holds up a sign to welcome january signing @entity30 to the club ahead of the game against @entity13 @entity22 calmly placed his spot - kick past @entity57 who barely moved as the @entity121 converted in the second minute @entity22 celebrates after giving @entity0 an early lead at the @entity25 following @entity64 's foul on @entity32 @entity26 waltzed through the @entity13 penalty area before putting his shot high into @entity57 's net to make it 2 - 0 to @entity0 in the @entity12 , @entity4 ’s advantage is now five points			1
in @entity131 , meanwhile , they will know that @entity18 have just lost for the first time in twelve games at exactly the wrong time			2
@entity13 actually won here in the @entity136 at the end of october but their @entity12 record in @entity139 – and particular against @entity0 – is awful			0
having lost their two previous league games at the @entity25 4 - 0 and not having win at @entity0 since september 2000 this always had the look of a troublesome afternoon for @entity77 and his players			1
it never helps , of course , when you concede a penalty within 27 seconds			0
@entity13 began the game trying to play the ball rather ambitiously out from the edge of their own penalty area and when @entity155 ’s first touch played him into trouble under pressure from @entity32 , his second brought the @entity159 centre forward crashing to earth			1
replays showed the contact between the players to be minimal but there was some nevertheless			0
@entity22 stepped forward to side foot the resulting penalty past @entity57 with a certain amount of ease			1
motivated no doubt by news of @entity4 ’s late implosion against @entity172 and facing such compliant opposition , @entity0 looked set fair as soon as @entity22 ’s penalty found the net			1
@entity13 briefly threatened to respond as @entity58 ’s long distance shot flew inches wide of @entity42 ’s right - hand post but it turned out to an isolated foray forward during a first half that @entity0 decorated with some lovely football			1
@entity61 and @entity64 watch on as @entity26 doubles the lead in the 12th minute at the @entity25 in saturday 's late kick off @entity57 was grounded and @entity26 simply placed the ball above the @entity187 keeper for @entity0 's second goal at the @entity25 @entity26 wheels away after making sure this game did not go the same way as @entity13 's 2 - 0 win at the @entity25 in the @entity136 @entity57 was again beaten , this time by @entity32 for the third goal after he converted from @entity37 's lofted through ball over the defence the @entity159 forward was thought to be slipping down the pecking order with @entity30 's arrival but his goal will have helped his position in the 13th minute @entity8 ’s team scored again			1
a goal that pretty much sealed the result , it was a super one to watch , too			0
@entity32 , pleased no doubt to be selected ahead of new signing @entity30 , crossed low from the left towards @entity22 but when the ball was deflected in to @entity26 ’s path , the @entity209 international beat one @entity13 defender with a perfect first touch , another with a drop of the shoulder and then side - footed the ball high to @entity57 ’s right with his left instep			1
ultimately , the actual finish proved to be the easy bit			0
so perfect had been @entity26 ’s control , composure and clarity of thinking that by the time he came to pick his spot the goal had become an inevitably			1
so too , now , had become the result			0
on the touchline @entity77 and assistant @entity227 talked the problem through at length			0
when you are two down within quarter of an hour at the champions , however , there often is n’t an answer			0
captain @entity44 puts and arm around the goalscorer as @entity0 run riot in the first half before adding more goals after the break @entity13 's players endured a torrid first half , as shown by the expressions of @entity64 , @entity60 and @entity66 ( @entity245 ) @entity22 breaks away from @entity63 ( right ) while @entity62 also tries to keep tabs on the explosive striker the game did n't exactly go the way that @entity13 's manager until the end of the season , @entity77 , would have wanted a black @entity0 fan holds up a sign in support of the victim of the racist attack by @entity4 fans on the @entity259 this week city – facing a goal difference as well as a points deficit behind @entity4 – sensed opportunity			1
a dummy from @entity43 allowed @entity22 to screw a shot across goal and wide while @entity32 – full of eager running – fizzed a shot from distance over the bar			1
@entity32 soon got his goal , though , and once again it was fantastic to watch			2
@entity37 ’s driven pass from deep dropped over @entity61 ’s head on to @entity32 ’s chest 12 yards out and he waited before striking it home on the half - volley with his left instep			1
@entity0 ’s supporters have seen some terrific football since @entity283 money transformed their club in 2008 but this 45 minutes was up there with the best			2
there was still time for @entity32 to head wide from a corner before the interval while they could even have had a couple more penalties			2
not that any of that really mattered for long			0
within eight minutes of the second half starting , @entity0 had two more goals			2
@entity37 finishes low into the corner to recommence the goalscoring after the half - time break and move @entity0 four goals clear in the game @entity37 celebrates with @entity22 after making it 4 - 0 at the @entity25 as the goals continued to pile on top of @entity13 keeper @entity57 @entity37 went on to blast in the fifth goal with the pick of the strikes from outside the area on saturday afternoon at @entity0 's @entity25 once again the football was great to watch but it was impossible to ignore @entity13 ’s compliance			1
in the run up to @entity37 ’s first goal in the 47th minute , @entity22 was allowed to run diagonally from almost inside his own half to the edge of the penalty box without anyone making a tackle			1
when he laid the ball off to @entity26 and the ball then found @entity37 , there was only going to be one outcome			2
there was a similar sense of inevitability soon after , too			0
this time @entity49 ’s diagonal pass found @entity22 and when he controlled it @entity37 arrived to drive his second goal – his team ’s fifth – across @entity328 from 18 yards			1
with more than half an hour left , it seemed as though @entity0 would score as many as they wished			2
@entity30 made his entrance at this stage , too , and he was denied a debut goal in the 76th minute by the legs of the @entity13 goalkeeper			1
remarkably , there were to be no more goals			0
@entity0 can only hope they have saved some for tuesday			0
@entity37 celebrates scoring @entity0 's fifth while @entity13 's @entity67 heads back to the half - way line in frustration @entity63 struggles to break through the challenges of @entity45 and @entity46 on one of @entity13 's rare attacks @entity30 replaced @entity22 for his first appearance in @entity0 's sky blue kit following his january move from @entity348 @entity30 holds his head after missing a chance to open his city account during the second half , not that it would have affected the result			1

@entity155 gave away a penalty after just 28 seconds to allow @entity22 to give @entity0 the lead from the spot
@entity26 added a second goal when he finished high into @entity57 's net after dancing through the defence
@entity32 *latched* on to @entity37 's long lofted pass to make it 3 - 0 before half - time at the @entity25
@entity37 added a fourth after half - time with a *smart* left - footed finish when a cross found him unmarked in the box
the @entity131 *midfielder* blasted in a fifth minutes later with a first - time strike from @entity22 's knock - down
@entity30 made his debut as a substitute , coming on for @entity22 in the second half
