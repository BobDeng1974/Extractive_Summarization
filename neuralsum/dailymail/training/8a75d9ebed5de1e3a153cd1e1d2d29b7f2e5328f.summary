patriotic women of all shapes and sizes come together to salute prince @entity8 in the middle of a road the @entity37 salute prince @entity8 and show off their photography skills while they 're at it how sweet : a woman getting steamy in the kitchen with her tea and coffee what a view ! this group of injured soldiers and their instructors brave the cold to beam into the camera you could park a bicycle in there ! this man puts safety first by donning a safety gear before saluting the prince but despite their anger , many have still taken to stripping off to show the young royal that they do n't mind his outrageous antics while he partied in @entity61			1
nearly 33,000 people had joined the @entity64 group ‘ support prince @entity63 ! ’ and many of the servicemen and women posed completely naked , using their hands or strategically placed guns , caps or rucksacks to protect their modesty			1

gone global : supporters of the @entity65 and his impromptu game of strip pool has garnered support from around the world - including from this proud @entity61 , left , and a very smiley man who appeared to shed his @entity92 boxer shorts in favour of just a straw hat for the photo in another , one man risks an unpleasant injury by clambering on to a bicycle before giving a cheeky wave outside his garden shed			2
one man improvises with a straw hat to keep his private parts out of sight , while another uses an @entity61 flag in his his cheeky photo			0

what 's all the @entity135 ? soldiers from @entity115 the @entity113 pose in front of tanks sock it to ' em , lads : this woman shows more than just her support , while two jokers wear just socks and wig it has become so popular that military personnel from around the world , including @entity149 and the @entity61 , have posted photos of themselves in the nude			1
the page was set up by ex-soldier @entity153 , 28 , from @entity155 and his friend @entity156 , after grainy pictures emerged of a naked prince @entity8 – along with two nude girls – taken during a game of strip billiards in his £ 5,100 - a - night suite at the @entity162 in @entity5			2
mr @entity153 said : ‘ it was outrageous [ that ] @entity8 was criticised for his antics in @entity5 because he is just one of the lads			0
‘ he might be a royal but he is also a hard - working @entity166 helicopter pilot and he wants to have some fun			0
i ’m sure @entity8 will be quietly smiling about the @entity64 group			2
’ he may , however , be less amused by claims yesterday that a video of the romp exists			0
mr @entity153 and mr @entity156 are now using the widespread popularity of the group to fund a good cause - walking with @entity174			2
this is for fighting : these lads are n't afraid to show off their weapons suited and booted : just footwear protects this man 's modesty , while this young lady may need a bigger uniform guns ' n poses : these troops keep themselves camouflaged ... just about on their website @entity188 , they chose the walking with the wounded charity which supports injured servicemen and women who have sustained horrific injuries as direct result of serving their country in times of war			1
