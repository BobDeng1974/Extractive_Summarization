' @entity7 , who said in august that he would step down within 12 months , was mostly light - hearted at what he called a ' unique and fun meeting			1
' one shareholder suggested a @entity30 government cabinet post as an information technology secretary be created for @entity7			2
the outgoing ceo replied that he did n't think the job would make sense , adding ' but thank you for trying to help me find work			0
' big shoes to fill : @entity3 ceo @entity7 ( pictured ) said in august he would step down from the top job @entity3 chairman @entity15 , front right , sits with other company officers at today 's annual shareholders meeting in @entity44 , @entity45 the company , based in @entity47 , @entity45 , said today that all of its proposals were approved			1
board nominees , including @entity7 and @entity15 , were re-elected with each nominee backed by more than 90 percent of the votes cast			1
@entity15 thanked @entity7 for his 33 years at @entity3 , 13 of them as ceo and made the point that for such a large corporation , it was unusual that there had only been two ceo 's - him and @entity59			1
' @entity7 and i really appreciated all the joys and challenges that came with being ceo , ' he said			2
' it ’s a real privilege to lead the incredibly talented group of employees we have			0
it ’s a privilege to work on the technology that ’s changed the world			0
' business partners and friends : @entity47 , @entity45 , @entity30 --- original caption : @entity15 and @entity7 during a press conference at @entity47 in 2000 gates choked up when talking about two other things that he and @entity59 share : ' we ’ve got a commitment to make sure that the next ceo is the right person for the right time for the company we both love			1
' and we share a commitment that @entity3 will succeed as a company that makes the world a better place			2
' @entity15 said on tuesday he was pleased with @entity3 's progress in finding a new chief executive but outlined the difficulties in picking the next leader of the world 's largest software company as it seeks to reinvent itself as a mobile computing power			1
@entity15 is part of the four - man committee that gave itself a year to find a successor to chief executive officer @entity7 after he announced his plan to retire in august			1
sources close to the process have said the search is down to a handful of candidates , but the company itself has been largely silent			0
beginnings : @entity47 , @entity45 , @entity30 --- @entity3 co-founder and ceo @entity15 with other @entity3 executives : @entity7 ( left ) and @entity109 ( center ) ' we 've been doing a lot of meetings with both internal and external candidates and we 're pleased with the progress , ' said @entity15 at @entity3 's annual shareholder meeting in @entity44 , @entity45			1
' we 're looking at a number of candidates and i 'm not going to give a timeline today			0
' @entity7 said in august he planned to retire within 12 months , and the ceo search committee - headed by lead independent director and former @entity124 executive @entity121 - tasked itself with finding a replacement by the end of that period			1
sources close to the company expect an appointment no later than january			0
gates , who in previous years did not address the shareholders ' meeting with prepared remarks , went on to describe the challenges of finding the right person to lead @entity3			1
' it 's a complex role to fill - a lot of different skills , experience and capabilities that we need , ' he said			0
' it 's a complex global business the new ceo will have to lead			0
the person has to have a lot of comfort in leading a highly technical organization and have an ability to work with our top technical talent to seize the opportunities			0
' indeed , few @entity154 wielded more power than @entity3 chief @entity7			1
and yet the company 's first and foremost salesman never gained the respect he deserved for his role in transforming @entity15 ' tiny startup in the woods outside @entity162 into the world 's largest software maker			2
@entity7 had the misfortune to follow @entity166 at the helm just as the company hit the end of its explosive growth period and faced a resurgent @entity171 under an inspired @entity172			2
the @entity174 native , who met @entity15 at @entity175 , was doubly unfortunate that his ascent to the ceo office in january 2000 came just weeks before the bursting of the dot.com stock bubble , from which @entity3 's share price never recovered			1
salesman and software genius : @entity7 and @entity15 at a @entity183 in 1986 in @entity184 , @entity185 although @entity7 did treble revenues at @entity3 during his time in charge , and managed to steer the company away from obscurity or crisis that befell other tech firms , he consistently attracted criticism for management miscues			1
under his watch , @entity171 and @entity195 roared past @entity3 in the emerging arena of internet search , smartphones and tablets , which made the software company look stodgy and behind - the - times			2
nobody can doubt his commitment to @entity3 , ' said @entity204 , an analyst at fund firm @entity205			2
" the missing element was execution			0
" his attempt to catch up was a failed $ 47 billion bid for fading internet giant @entity211 in 2008 , a company which is now worth much less			0
@entity211 's inexplicable decision to reject the deal probably saved @entity7 's job			2
@entity7 never lacked passion and energy for the company he helped to build , but he was always more of a salesman and cheerleader than a technology visionary			2
' that is the most expensive phone in the world and it does n't appeal to business customers , ' @entity7 laughed in a tv interview after the launch of @entity171 's @entity227 in 2007			0
five years later , @entity227 sales alone were greater than @entity3 's overall revenue			2
@entity15 ( r ) , chairman of @entity3 , and @entity7 ( @entity231 ) , ceo and president of @entity3 , talk to members of the media during @entity236 at @entity3 headquarters 22 june 2000 in @entity47 , @entity45 a clip of a semi-hysterical @entity7 screeching and dancing around the stage to rally @entity3 employees has been viewed nearly five million times on @entity243 , gaining him the nickname ' @entity245 '			1
and his hypnotic and slightly unhinged mantra of ' developers , developers , developers ' , captured at another company conference , made him the butt of jokes for years after			0
a natural math whiz from @entity254 , @entity7 met @entity15 at @entity175 before @entity15 dropped out to co-found @entity3 in 1975			1
five years later , @entity15 persuaded @entity7 to drop out of @entity255 to become @entity3 's first commercial manager , and only the company 's 30th employee , giving him an 8 percent stake			1
as @entity3 's first salesman , rather than a techie , he was viewed with some distrust			0
' the first time we met face - to - face , i thought this guy looks like an operative for the @entity271 ( @entity270 police ) , ' recalled @entity3 co-founder @entity272 in his memoir			0
' he had piercing blue eyes and a genuine toughness			0
though as i got to know him better , i found a gentler side as well			0
' @entity272 said that the young @entity7 - a zealous basketball player and jogger - would wake him up at 7 a.m. doing push - ups in their shared hotel room on early business trips			0
as @entity3 engineered the personal computer revolution through the 80s and 90s , the sales side of the organization grew in size and importance , led by the charismatic @entity7 - unmistakable on campus and at industry meetings with his shiny bald dome , strapping physique and booming voice			1
in @entity3 - speak , employees were either a ' @entity293 ' , meaning a technology person , or a ' @entity295 ' , meaning a sales and marketing person			0
@entity3 ceo @entity7 ( @entity231 ) and chairman @entity15 ( r ) answer questions 01 november 2002 in @entity47 , @entity45 when @entity7 , known internally as @entity302 , took over from @entity15 as @entity3 ceo in 2000 , some saw it as the triumph of sales over technology and innovation , which ultimately ruined the company			1
' i have my own theory about why decline happens at companies like @entity124 or @entity3 , ' former @entity171 ceo @entity172 is quoted as saying in his biography			2
' the quality of the product becomes less important			0
the company starts valuing the great salesmen			0
' @entity172 was partially correct			0
under @entity7 's watch , @entity3 missed the shift to smartphones and tablets , and its share price has been static for the last decade			1
all the while , @entity7 tended to push out any executives who threatened his power			0
' his ( @entity7 's ) continued presence is the biggest overhang on @entity3 's stock , ' prominent hedge fund investor @entity326 said in 2011 , as he campaigned publicly for @entity7 's ouster			1
@entity3 shares rose 7 percent on the news of @entity7 's retirement on friday			1
but @entity7 's record as a ceo was not as bad as many think			2
people close to him say his loud public persona belied a quietly shrewd business mind , and he managed @entity3 as well as anyone could as the company reached a mature stage			0
he boosted @entity3 's revenues and more than doubled its already large profits			0
he outlasted erstwhile rivals such as @entity345 and @entity346 , which have now all - but disappeared , and avoided the boardroom fiascos of @entity348 or dramatic decline of @entity350			0
' i do n't see anybody else on the management team at @entity3 that i think would be much better than @entity7 , ' said @entity354 at hedge fund @entity355 .			2

@entity3 ceo @entity7 attended his final shareholders meeting today as chief executive
@entity7 announced in august he would step down after 13 years as ceo
chairman @entity15 got emotional during *farewell* speech
