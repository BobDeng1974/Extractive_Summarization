@entity2 , 78 , was arrested at his home in @entity13 , @entity4 , to stand trial on the historic offences - the vast majority of which were committed when he was a serving police officer in @entity15 , @entity16 , and @entity17			1
the defendant emigrated in 2002 and had been living there for seven years when one of his two victims walked into a police station in @entity16 and said @entity2 had sexually and physically abused her as a child			1
the woman was interviewed at length and when the investigation widened a man came forward and said he too had been abused by the defendant , @entity24 was told			1
he was arrested in @entity30 earlier this year and brought to the @entity9 where he denied the allegations against him , said to have taken place in the 1960s and early 1970s			2
last week a jury unanimously found him guilty of 20 charges of historic abuse including rape , buggery , indecency with a child , indecent assault and child cruelty			2
sentencing him , mr justice @entity44 said each offence was a ‘ serious example ’ of sexual and physical abuse which was committed in a sustained way			2
each of the two complainants had been deprived of achieving their full potential in adulthood as a consequence , he added			2
the judge continued : ‘ each has suffered from deep depression over the years			2
each has felt suicidal and attempted suicide			0
i have no doubt that the major cause of all their lifelong problems is the abuse each suffered at your hands			0
’ he observed that @entity2 had shown ‘ no contrition ’ and ‘ no remorse ’ for the ‘ deep and long - lasting ’ effects he had caused			1
sentencing : @entity24 ( file picture ) was told one of the women was interviewed at length and when the investigation widened a man came forward and said he too had been abused by the defendant @entity2 was sentenced to 18 years in jail for the rape of the female complainant when she was a child			1
he received concurrent sentences of the same length for two other counts of rape and received concurrent terms of between 18 months and 13 years for the remaining offences			2
both complainants gave victim impact statements which were partly read out in court			2
the female victim said @entity2 had enjoyed making her terrified of him and as a result she had not become the person she ought to have been			1
‘ i feel i have wasted my life , ’ she said			0
‘ i have never achieved my true potential and i never will			0
’ the male victim said he had less confidence because of the abuse inflicted			2
as an intelligent man , he should have gone to university but did not , and his adult relationships have been ‘ virtually non-existent ’ because of his fear of anyone getting too close to him emotionally			0
he said he thought @entity99 would not be happy in custody but added : ‘ he will be happy that two lives will be ruined as a result of what he has done			0
’ mitigating , @entity106 asked for his client ’s age and his ongoing problems with diabetes to be taken into account in fixing the jail term			0
a lengthy sentence would mean it was likely he would die in prison , he argued			0
mr justice @entity44 told the court that the 18 - year term would have been ‘ justifiably longer ’ if @entity99 had been younger			0
he took into account that he was a man of previous good character and had an unblemished record in the police force			2
@entity2 was also disqualified from working with children and can not have any unsupervised contact with children except with the permission of a youngster ’s parent or guardian and the express approval of social services in the area			1
abroad : @entity2 was arrested in @entity30 ( file picture ) in @entity13 earlier this year and brought to the @entity9 where he denied the allegations against him , said to have taken place in the 1960s and early 1970s opening the case , prosecutor @entity138 said the female victim went on to suffer from depression and anxiety from the ‘ quite appalling ’ abuse she suffered at his hands			1
‘ she was clearly unable to cope with what happened to her , ’ she said			0
in the mid- 1970s she wrote to the defendant and told him how she felt about what he had done to her , the jury was told			0
she received no response or acknowledgement from @entity99			0
physical abuse : the female victim denied the abuse was a figment of her imagination gleaned from reading books such as @entity160 's a child called it following his emigration , she wrote more letters to him in which she said she was concerned that he had not changed and would go on to commit similar offences			1
she said her death ‘ would n’t bring matters to a close for him ’ because she had told her gp , her husband and also her children about the abuse			0
today , the judge said @entity2 had chosen to stay silent when receiving the letters and ‘ undoubtedly called her bluff ’ when she threatened to disclose matters			1
in december 2009 she finally made a complaint to the police			1
giving evidence , @entity2 denied all the charges against him and said he was ‘ not of the persuasion ’ of someone who sexually abuses children			1
he said he had never thought of returning to @entity9 since his move because he had no reason to do so and because of the expense of travelling			0
@entity2 claimed illness prevented him flying over for his son ’s wedding			1
it was suggested that his accusers had a personal hostility towards him which led them to give false evidence to the court			0
under cross-examination , the female victim denied the abuse was a figment of her imagination gleaned from reading books such as @entity160 ’s a child called it			1
she denied that the book , which details the physical abuse of a child by his mother , had influenced her in any way to believe she had been abused herself			1
following sentencing , detective inspector @entity210 said : ‘ these were despicable offences committed against two young children , made all the more sinister by @entity99 ’s insistence of innocence and his attempts to persuade the jury his victims had invented the abuse			1
' this considerable custodial sentence reflects the depravity of what he has done			0
i would like to pay tribute to the bravery of the victims and to the hard work of the investigative team and our partners at the @entity233 for bringing the case to court and securing this conviction			0
‘ @entity237 will always take allegations of sexual abuse extremely seriously , and we will always hunt offenders like @entity99 down , no matter how long ago the abuse or how far across the world we need to travel to bring them to justice			0
