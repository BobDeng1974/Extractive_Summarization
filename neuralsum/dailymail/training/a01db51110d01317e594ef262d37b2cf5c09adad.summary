in the closing stages of this game , we were on familiar territory			0
@entity4 were close to victory and were exerting pressure			1
one shot was saved by the @entity9 goalkeeper while another was hacked from the line			1
it could have been 4 - 1			1
half an hour earlier , however , things were very different			2
here was the real picture of this dispiriting night for the biggest club in @entity17 football			0
back then – early in the second half – the @entity4 lead was 2 - 1 and they were firmly on the back foot , where they had been most of the night			1
@entity23 rises above the @entity9 defence to score @entity4 's second goal on wednesday night @entity26 – playing as a defensive midfielder – was being booked for persistent fouling and @entity4 were being booed by a small section of the @entity31 crowd			1
they were not booing individual players , though some of them may have deserved it			0
no , they were showing their displeasure at something much worse			0
they were booing the style – the nature – of their team ’s play			0
it was n’t everybody in the ground – far from it – and it did n’t last long			0
but it was unmistakably there			0
it was there as @entity4 broke away and then , with a numerical overload beckoning , started to funnel the ball backwards towards the halfway line			2
it was there again , minutes later , when @entity26 turned and played a free - kick from opposition territory back in to his own half			1
injury - hit defender @entity60 ca n't hide his disappointment after being forced off in the fifth minute substitute @entity23 scored with his first touch of the ball after replacing injured @entity60 @entity9 keeper @entity64 dives in vain as @entity23 's header loops into the corner of the net @entity23 celebrates his first goal against @entity9 at @entity31 @entity4 ( 4 - 1 - 2 - 1 - 2 ) : @entity70 7 ; @entity71 7 , @entity60 6 ( @entity23 5mins 6 ) , @entity72 5 , @entity73 6 ; blind 6 ( @entity74 38mins 6 ) ; @entity26 6 , @entity75 5 ; @entity76 5 ; @entity77 5 ( @entity78 74mins 6 ) , @entity79 5 subs not used : @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84			1

goal : @entity94 12 booked : @entity91 , @entity89 , @entity90 referee : @entity103 man of the match : @entity91 att : 75,356 click here for all the stats , goals - including @entity23 's second goal ( above ) - and heat maps from @entity31 over the years , we have seen just about everything at this great stadium			1
most of it good , some of it not so			0
this , though , was almost unprecedented			0
@entity4 being outpassed , outplayed , outrun and outthought by a team that began the game in 19th place in the @entity121			2
their midfield was superior all night , @entity91 emerging as the star			0
particularly in the first half they threatened to take @entity4 apart			1
they dominated possession , created chances and scored a very good goal			2
somehow , however , the @entity131 team ended the half a goal down			2
@entity4 managed to bookend the opening 45 minutes with set piece goals for @entity23			1
in between those goals , however , there was only one team playing any football			0
right from the start , @entity9 were at it and @entity4 were n't			1
in the very first minute , former @entity4 central defender @entity87 headed wide from a corner when it looked easier to score			1
we presumed it would be a rare offensive movement but we were wrong			0
we should have known better			0
soon after , @entity60 went off injured and @entity23 came on			1
within 21 seconds he scored			1
@entity147 was also forced off injured in the first half after a clash of heads and replaced by @entity74 @entity23 was caught out as @entity9 striker @entity94 was left unmarked to head the equaliser in the 12th minute @entity94 peeled away from @entity23 to convert a cross from @entity86 in the 12th minute a super volley from @entity71 was saved but when the corner arrived , a spot of head tennis saw @entity77 nod the ball across for @entity23 who gave @entity4 the lead with his very first touch			1
momentarily that seemed to settle @entity4			2
they had an early lead and , historically , that has meant only one thing			0
on this occasion , though , against this @entity4 team , @entity9 merely steeled themselves and proceeded to dominate the game for the next half an hour			1
within the first 15 minutes of the game they created four clear chances			2
@entity94 ' 12th minute header to equalise was a beauty , the striker peeling subtlely away from @entity23 to convert a cross from @entity86			1
as well as that , @entity91 broke down the left and made @entity177 save , an @entity94 shot from a corner hit his own player almost on the goal line and a curling effort from @entity93 missed by a foot			1
for a while it was embarrassing for @entity4			2
@entity91 was running the game , dumping @entity186 on his backside to steal possession one moment and nut megging @entity26 to dart in to the penalty area the next			2
at the other end , @entity77 and @entity79 were awful			0
neither could hold the ball up			0
@entity23 leapt above former @entity4 defender @entity87 to head his team back into the lead @entity23 became the first substitute to score a first - half brace in @entity121 history a @entity23 mistake gifted a great chance to @entity94 just after half - time but he failed to convert from eight yards @entity186 sealed victory from the spot after @entity207 had been upended by @entity90 relief all round after another unconvincing display by @entity4 at @entity31 @entity4 goalkeeper @entity177 shows his relief after @entity79 seald victory from the spot ultimately , though , @entity9 did n’t score another goal and just as a patient home crowd were beginning to despair , @entity4 broke away to edge back in front			1
@entity26 and @entity207 worked a short corner on the right and when the @entity217 crossed to the far post @entity23 leapt above @entity87 to head his team back in to a most unlikely lead			1
certainly it was tempting to wonder where the game would go from here			0
would @entity4 take something from the fact they were ahead and go on to play some football ? or would @entity9 continue to forage forwards in search of a reward they knew was there for them ? the first few minutes of the second half told its own story			1
@entity92 eased down the right for @entity9 and when he crossed , @entity23 and @entity74 – on in place of injured @entity147 – got in each other ’s way to present @entity94 with a straight forward chance			1
@entity94 should have buried it			2
it was in his territory			0
this time , though , he hesitated and then contributed a poor first touch			2
that gave @entity240 the chance to block at his feet and the rebound then flew over			0
maybe that was the decisive moment of the game			0
had @entity9 scored at that point , @entity4 may have fallen apart			1
they knew what they were watching , they recognised the signs of a team mired in uncertainty , welded fast to a formation they are n’t uncomfortable with			0
@entity26 ’s role was remarkable			0
pushed backwards by @entity147 ’s exit , @entity256 ’s captain and most prolific modern goal scorer spent his night so far away from the opposition net it was a wonder he could even see it			2
bit by bit , minute by minute , in this rare atmosphere , @entity4 somehow edged towards a most unlikely victory			2
@entity75 appealed for one penalty and then finally won one in the 81st minute			0
@entity9 – clearly tiring – lost possession from their own corner and when @entity75 broke , @entity90 took him down and @entity79 converted the penalty			1
at strange night , a strange result			0
@entity271 called it a “ lucky win ” and on this occasion he did n’t need any pieces of paper to convince us he was right			0
manager @entity278 ( left ) has work to do after joint chairmen @entity280 , left , and @entity282 saw another unconvincing display @entity271 shakes hands with @entity77 after he was substituted in the second half @entity76 , right , fights for the ball against @entity9 's @entity90 @entity75 made up for a lacklustre display on wednesday night by winning late penalty			1

@entity4 moved up to third in the table with a 3 - 1 win over @entity9 at @entity31
@entity23 put @entity4 in front just 21 seconds after coming on to replace the injured @entity60
@entity94 equalised for @entity9 with a superb diving header after 12 minutes
defender @entity23 added his unlikely second with headed goal in first half injury time
@entity186 converted from the spot after @entity90 fouled @entity207 in the box
