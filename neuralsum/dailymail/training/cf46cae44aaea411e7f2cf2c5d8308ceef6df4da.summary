another actor has come forward to accuse @entity1 of attempted sexual assault			1
@entity3 , the actress best known for her roles on @entity5 : @entity6 and @entity7 , says she was a stand - in on the set of @entity10 when @entity1 started acting increasingly inappropriate around her , saying , ' never tell anyone what we [ do ] together			1
' what 's more , she states that at least one person on set woke up at his apartment drugged on one occasion			1
' look , i was n’t going to say anything , but i ca n’t believe some of the things i ’ve been reading , so here is my personal experience , ' she begins			0
' i did stand - in work on the @entity1 show back in the day and @entity37 , @entity1 was very inappropriate with me			1
' she goes on to discuss being touched in ways she did not like and being asked to eat lunch with him in his dressing room			1
then , things got to be too much for @entity3			2
' i dodged the ultimate bullet with him when he asked me to come to his house , take a shower so we could blow dry my hair and see what it looked like straightened , ' she says			2

' unacceptable : @entity3 shared that another stand - in who worked on @entity10 ( above ) did wake up at @entity1 's apartment drugged private person with no reason to lie : @entity3 is a notoriously private actor , keeping even the date of her marriage to fellow actor @entity64 ( above ) out of the press that unfortunately was not the case for another actress who @entity3 began trading stories with on set			1
' turns out he was doing the same thing to her , almost by the numbers , but , she did go to his house and because i will not name her , and it is her story to tell , all i ’ll say is she awoke , after being drugged , vomited , and then @entity1 told her there ’s a cab waiting for you outside			1
' @entity3 , who is married to fellow actor @entity64 and so private that no one even knows their wedding date , then stresses that she has no reason whatsoever to lie about what happened			1
@entity87 @entity86 employee , she claimed in 2006 that @entity1 drugged and sexually assaulted her in his @entity90 - area mansion two years earlier			1
@entity1 eventually settled this suit out of court as the prosecution said they had 13 @entity94 who would testify @entity1 did the same to them in the past			1
@entity97 told @entity98 that @entity1 raped and drugged her back in 1985 when she was a 17 - year - old aspiring actress			1

@entity122 said earlier this week that she was just 19 when @entity1 drove her out to a beach and tried to get her to take pills to relax , before becoming ' sexually aggressive '			2
@entity125 , of @entity126 , @entity127 , has been charged in the past with trafficking pills			0
@entity1 's attorney , @entity129 , is trying to use @entity131 's past to discredit her claims against his client			1
@entity134 - @entity134 claims she had relationship with @entity1 in the mid- 1980s			2
she claims that she awoke in her car with her clothes in disarray and not remembering what had happened			0
@entity134 has claimed that he drugged her coffee			0
@entity141 - the wife of @entity143 star @entity142 , claims @entity1 tried to sexually assault her during a gathering at his house in 1967			0
what 's more , @entity1 allegedly tried to use a friend to help court @entity142 , and allegedly made his move on the former @entity151 just moments after his own wife , @entity152 , left the room			1
@entity154 - the former model - actress claims that @entity1 forced her to masturbate him in his @entity113 hotel suite after giving her a strong drink in 1992			0
meanwhile , @entity1 's laywer , @entity157 , has released a statement calling recent rape allegations ' increasingly ridiculous ' and ' completely illogical			1
' ' this situation is an unprecedented example of the media 's breakneck rush to run stories without any corroboration or adherence to traditional journalistic standards , ' says @entity129			0
' over and over again , we have refuted these new unsubstantiated stories with documentary evidence , only to have a new uncorroborated story crop up out of the woodwork			0
when will it end ? ' he then closes by saying , ' it is long past time for this media vilification of mr. @entity1 to stop			0
' ten women have come forward in the last month saying they were attacked by @entity1 , with @entity178 , @entity116 and @entity154 the latest additions			2
four of the women claim they were teenagers at the time			0
one of the accusers is supermodel @entity104 , who claims that during a dinner in 1982 the actor gave her a pill and when she woke up he was on top of her			0
another four ladies ; @entity97 , @entity101 , @entity108 and @entity111 have all shared remarkably similar stories in which they claim to have shared a drink or a pill with @entity1 and then woken up after or while they say he was sexually assaulting them			0
also coming forward recently is @entity141 , wife of @entity143 star @entity142 , who says @entity1 tried to sexually assault her during a gathering at his house in 1967			2
what 's more , @entity1 allegedly tried to use a friend to help court @entity142 , and allegedly made his move on the former @entity151 just moments after his own wife , @entity152 , left the room			1
when asked to speak about these claims in an @entity203 interview , @entity1 said he had ' no response ' and ' no comment			2
' the new , never - before - heard claims from women who have come forward in the past two weeks with unsubstantiated , fantastical stories about things they say occurred 30 , 40 , or even 50 years ago have escalated far past the point of absurdity			0
these brand new claims about alleged decades - old events are becoming increasingly ridiculous , and it is completely illogical that so many people would have said nothing , done nothing , and made no reports to law enforcement or asserted civil claims if they thought they had been assaulted over a span of so many years			1
lawsuits are filed against people in the public eye every day			0
there has never been a shortage of lawyers willing to represent people with claims against rich , powerful men , so it makes no sense that not one of these new women who just came forward for the first time now ever asserted a legal claim back at the time they allege they had been sexually assaulted			0
this situation is an unprecedented example of the media 's breakneck rush to run stories without any corroboration or adherence to traditional journalistic standards			0
over and over again , we have refuted these new unsubstantiated stories with documentary evidence , only to have a new uncorroborated story crop up out of the woodwork			0
when will it end ? it is long past time for this media vilification of mr. @entity1 to stop			0
these allegations are already having a major impact on his work however , with @entity259 postponing the airing of his new comedy special , @entity1 77 , which was due to air the day after @entity262 , and @entity263 pulling the plug on a comedy project they were developing with the @entity10 star			1
@entity268 has also announced they will no longer air reruns of @entity10 on the network			0
despite all this , @entity1 did perform in the @entity272 on thursday and in @entity127 on friday			0
his upcoming standup shows in @entity113 and @entity274 have however been cancelled .			0

@entity3 , the actor known for her work on @entity24 : @entity6 and @entity7 has come forward to share her story about @entity1
@entity3 says @entity1 touched her inappropriately and asked that she eat lunch with him in his dressing room when she worked on @entity10
she says @entity1 told her to ' never tell anyone what they did together '
then , one night he asked her to shower at his apartment , but she *declined*
@entity3 eventually spoke with another woman who said she woke up at @entity1 's apartment drugged one *morning*
this as @entity1 's lawyer is calling the growing number of allegations against the actor ' increasingly ridiculous ' and ' completely illogical '
