by @entity0 if you ca n’t stand the heat get out of the @entity3 , to misquote @entity4			1
@entity5 will have its say in @entity7 in terms of preparation , tactics and the football , especially for @entity13 nations			1
@entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 are baked by fierce tropical heat and have seven lunchtime kick - offs , while @entity20 steams in the relentless equatorial climate of the @entity23 rainforest			1
@entity24 play their opener against @entity26 there			1
they could be in @entity17 for the last 16 and @entity14 or @entity15 for a quarter - final , so much of @entity30 ’s early work in training has been done in fear of the mercury rising			1
the link between hot and humid conditions and athletic performance is clinically proven			1
hot and humid : a member of the ground staff looks after the pitch in the @entity42 stadium in @entity20 heat and performance fitness can be measured by the volume of oxygen your body can consume while exercising			1
when you see athletes on the treadmill wearing something that looks like a gas - mask , that ’s what they ’re measuring			2
the masks link to computers which display a @entity59 reading			1
most footballers will be aware of their reading , which should be around 50 , which represents 50 millilitres of oxygen per minute per kilo of bodyweight			2
you increase it by exercising at 65 - 85 per cent of your maximum for at least 20 minutes , three or four times a week			2
@entity70 clubs will usually test players three times a year : at the start of pre-season , midway through the season and at the end			2
in april sports scientists found that at @entity78 the @entity59 dropped by four per cent and physical work capacity by eight per cent			2
unfamiliar surroundings : @entity24 will be out of their comfort zone in sweltering @entity7 playing it cool players will regularly clock up 12 - 14km during 90 minutes in the @entity70 but it will be very difficult to cover this ground in extreme conditions and be ready to play again four days later			1
in the north of @entity7 , especially in the seven games kicking off at 1pm , the pace of the game is expected to be slow and cautious			1
coaches will preach about patience , possession and conserving energy			2
@entity24 ’s passers , like captain @entity95 , will be vital in @entity20 , dictating tempo and protecting the ball			1
they will be up against @entity100 , @entity26 ’s master of the art. even with a kick - off at 6pm local time , it is expected to be hot and sticky			1
master at work : @entity100 will protect the ball in the savage heat @entity108 it does not take much to push the body over the line in extreme heat and humidity			2
it is like a car when it overheats			2
in the worst cases , it can affect the central nervous system and that in turn affects your decision - making			2
you only need to be half - a - second out with your timing and you ’re making tackles which will expose yourself and others to a greater likelihood of injuries			0
on a @entity132 pre-season tour , in @entity130 , one of the players came in at half - time in a real mess			0
the water was draining from him			0
we laid him out on a towel and he left a soaking wet perfect imprint of his body			0
he had taken on the correct amount of fluids but he was suffering from heatstroke and dehydration and it had started to affect his central nervous system			0
we were close to putting him on a drip but managed to cool his core temperature with cold towels in key areas of his body			0
sipping fluids in extreme heat dehydration can strike fast			0
they have to keep sipping fluids all the time before the problems start			0
if you drink only water it will dilute everything in your system and wash out minerals and vitamins you want to keep in			0
you have to keep putting the right carbohydrates and electrolytes in			0
sometimes you see players sucking gel sachets beside the pitch			0
they offer a short burst of carbs with a little bit of sodium			0
ideally you ’d take them with water			0
keeping hydrated : @entity177 has the right idea in @entity179 wrapping up @entity30 ordered his players to wrap up warm for training in @entity183 , and @entity24 ’s trip to @entity185 was based around gradually becoming accustomed to increased heat and humidity			1
the idea of training in woolly hats , gloves and thermals might seem simplistic and old - fashioned , but it makes sense and it does work			0
i know elite athletes who compete in these hot places without trying to acclimatise			1
they stay away and go in , race and get out as quickly as possible , so the body does n’t even begin to adjust , but @entity24 are at the @entity3 over four weeks			1
shading it managing time off becomes important in the heat because recovery is as important as training			0
years ago we ’d have to stop players from sunbathing			0
not only were they dehydrating but they were burning the skin as well			0
that ’s not good preparation			1
@entity24 players will be in @entity179 but @entity30 wo n’t want them heading for the beach			1
you want them to keep out of the sun. interview by @entity217			0
