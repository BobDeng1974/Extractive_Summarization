@entity0 has made it clear he wants to join @entity2			1
the striker is furious he has been blamed for @entity4 getting knocked out of the @entity5			2
he was always set to leave @entity6 this summer but he is now convinced , not least because he feels he is a target for ‘ ultras ’ racists and despite problems he encountered in the @entity11 while at @entity12 , he recognises that @entity13 is more cosmopolitan – especially @entity14			1
@entity27 , who sold 18 - year - old @entity29 to @entity30 for £ 27million plus add - ons , could snap up 16 - year - old left back protegee @entity33 from @entity34			1
@entity33 is yet to sign as a scholar for the @entity34 but would cost the @entity27 around £ 220,000 under academy compensation rules			1
@entity26 have pulled out of the race – first revealed in the @entity38 – to outbid @entity39 for @entity40			1
instead , @entity26 are poised to sign @entity42 @entity41 – who has missed the @entity43 through injury – from @entity45 in a £ 60million deal			1
that could see @entity26 drive down @entity40 ’s fee significantly			1
moving on ? @entity40 ( left ) and @entity41 ( right ) could join @entity39 and @entity26 respectively @entity50 @entity49 , currently of @entity51 , will come back on the radar of @entity30 if @entity53 does not agree to how @entity54 wants to utilise him			1
it is understood @entity56 is set to play hard - ball with @entity53 as a statement of intent of who is charge at @entity61			2
@entity62 wants to stay at @entity63 and @entity64 may even offer to play for the club rather than go ‘ on loan ’ to @entity66 ahead of playing for @entity68 in the msl			1
@entity70 believe they will sign @entity72 left - back @entity71 when the transfer window opens on july 1			2
in the market : @entity70 want to sign @entity72 's @entity71 ( right ) @entity75 this week there is really only one thing to say			2
despite some terrific games , goals and excitement , professional football no longer feels @entity82 – the beautiful game			2
allegations of @entity86 corruption , bungs for betting syndicates and a player assaulting a fellow professional for no reason			2
there is an old newspaper saying : dog bites man , no story			0
man bites dog , big story			0
but , far from losing his livelihood or even liberty , @entity40 arrived back in @entity50 following his ban after an unprovoked assault on @entity104 @entity103 hailed as a national hero			1
banned : @entity40 was handed a four - month suspension for biting @entity107 indeed , he can look forward to a pay rise if a move to @entity39 goes through			1
sometimes justice and morality around modern football seems to be upside - down			0
after all his grandmother has been quoted as saying the @entity86 ban was ‘ barbaric ’ and he has been treated like a , er , ‘ dog ’ as if he has been the victim of rough , rough justice			0
@entity119 @entity120 clings onto @entity121 and @entity64 , but how can they possibly be the future ? both of them have been great players			1
and top blokes , too			0
but the fact is that , either as a partnership or in their own right , for all their caps they have not influenced their country as they have done their respective clubs			0
yet , misguidedly , @entity120 thinks @entity121 and @entity64 can help bring the @entity134 on			1
time to move on : @entity64 ( left ) and @entity121 have yet to decide on their @entity13 futures yes , having some experience in the middle of the park would help @entity139 , @entity140 and , possibly , @entity141			1
so why not look to @entity34 ’s @entity142 and @entity144 ’s @entity143 ? they are both 27 and were both magnificent midfield leaders for their clubs last season			1
@entity149 @entity40 has moved into no 1 position for the most outrageous incident on the pitch at a @entity5			2
and the previous worst ? well , not his ‘ @entity157 ’ incident at the last finals , nor @entity155 ’s in 1986 , and not even the @entity156 turn out in 1966			0
the spat between @entity160 @entity159 and @entity162 @entity161 at the 1990 finals was vile			0
btw in a week when football has been in moral maze – some might argue malaise – let ’s not forget the positive power of the game			0
@entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 and @entity174 were among ex-stars who , on friday night , added their weight to support @entity178 – a charity connected to @entity180 hero @entity179			0
for more information , go to @entity182 @entity183 a @entity160 aerospace engineering company , @entity184 , have said that if @entity185 win the whole thing , they will fly the squad and manager @entity56 into space			0
it brings a new dimension to the old cliche about being ‘ @entity193			0
’ @entity194 it ’s understandable why @entity196 have kept their foot on the ball and not responded to the @entity40 situation until they have seen the fine print			1
last time around , the club ’s knee - jerk reaction backfired			0
what next ? @entity203 and @entity196 must decide what to do about @entity40 video @entity40 family say he should leave @entity196 but it ’s not as if @entity196 are close to taking a moral stance			1
they want to maximise a commercial asset			0
condemning @entity40 would only result in his transfer fee plummeting even more			2
@entity196 wanted £ 100million but now think they can still get £ 80m despite all the baggage			2
that ’s how the business of football has become – even for a club with such strong views on morals			0
@entity217 why does the @entity218 think a proper post-mortem into the debacle in @entity19 is not required ? why is @entity120 , who has presided over dire showings at two tournaments , seemingly fire proof ? the answer is , for all the so called modernisation at the @entity218 , the ‘ blazers ’ in charge want a yes man who ticks the boxes rather than a man who would tear up some trees			0
i - bet @entity233 is 20 - 1 to score a hat trick against @entity235 with @entity236			0
all smiles : @entity233 will be looking to add to his @entity5 tally against @entity235			0

@entity0 wants to join @entity2
@entity27 want @entity33 from @entity34
@entity41 looks set to join @entity26
@entity121 and @entity64 are not the future for @entity13
@entity196 are right to be *cautious* over @entity40
