the band ’s lead singer @entity39 has previously said the odd line was inspired by a quote from journalist @entity43 : ‘ we ’re raising a generation of dancers , ’ critiquing the conformity of modern society			1
the frontman told @entity49 : ‘ it ’s taken from a quote by @entity43 : “ we ’re raising a generation of dancers , ” and i took it and ran			2
i guess it bothers people that it ’s not grammatically correct , but i think i ’m allowed to do whatever i want			2
’ the @entity33 were voted as having the most confusing lyrics of all in their song with the line ' are we human , or are we dancer ? ' from the tune human ' what about elephants ? have we lost their trust ? ' : @entity15 's @entity64 left 18 per cent of @entity24 confused second place was taken by @entity14 , with 27 percent of people failing to grasp the famously confusing line : ‘ i am the eggman , they are the eggman , i am the walrus , goo goo g’joob ’ , from their 1967 song @entity22 , the b - side to their number one hit @entity77			1

’ – @entity118 , @entity119 - 7 % 10			0
‘ slowly walking down the hall , faster than a cannonball ’ - @entity120 , @entity121 - 7 % there have been several explanations put forward for the unusual lyrics , but @entity127 , professor of popular music politics at @entity129 , said : ‘ @entity130 spoke of writing some of this while on an acid trip , which might help explain things			0
‘ it is an exercise in surrealism and word play – a true highlight of @entity37 psychedelia			0
@entity130 did once declare that ‘ @entity140 was @entity141 ’ but it appears to in fact be a reference to @entity146 ’s @entity145 and so , a reference to surreal or imaginary worlds			0
’ @entity130 himself told @entity150 in an interview that the song was part of his ‘ [ @entity154 ] dylanesque period ’ which was characterised by ‘ the trick of never saying what you mean but giving the impression of something more			1
where more or less can be read into it			0
it ’s a good game			0
’ @entity15 completes the top three , with 18 percent of people struggling with the @entity64 lyrics : ‘ what about the elephants ? have we lost their trust ? ’ the famously eccentric @entity15 wrote @entity64 , which reached number one in the @entity37 charts , as a protest over his concerns regarding animal welfare and the environment but it is branded ‘ misjudged ’ by @entity175			0
explaining the words ' @entity177 ya , hey jambo jumbo , ' in @entity16 ’s @entity89 , professor @entity127 said : ' @entity16 has himself admitted that the lyrics are ‘ a wonderful joke ’ and an attempt to insert some @entity183 dialect into the song , which he could n’t do in time , so just made up			1
they have no meaning outside of sounding right in the song			1
' gobbledegook : ever sang ' @entity88 ya , hey jambo jumbo ' from @entity16 's song @entity89 and wondered what you were saying ? if so then you 're not alone - 12 per cent of @entity24 polled said they did n't have the foggiest either but he admitted he was baffled by the @entity96 ' beats so big i 'm stepping on leprechauns '			1
he said : ' sometimes i think we just have to accept songwriters are strange			0
' when asked for their reasons for failing to follow the songs , 40 percent of people said it was because they simply could not make out the words , 27 percent said the lack of logic made them think they had misheard the lyrics , while ten percent said the use of slang puzzled them			1
almost two - thirds ( 64 percent ) said the problem had become worse over time			0
despite the issue , 28 percent said that not understanding all the lyrics to a song would not stop them from enjoying it			2
this is borne out by the fact that , out of the ten songs voted to have the most confusing lines , nine made it into the @entity37 top ten – the exception is @entity120 ’s @entity121 – including four number ones			1
the poll , conducted by blinkbox music , also asked people to vote for the modern pop star with the worst lyrics			2
@entity232 came first with 17 percent of the vote , followed by the rapper @entity234 , @entity34 pop star @entity235 , @entity237 judge @entity236 and his group @entity96 , @entity238 , country singer @entity118 , @entity239 , @entity98 frontman @entity240 , @entity241 and @entity39 of @entity33 .			2
