a @entity1 mp yesterday branded his accuser ‘ vindictive ’ and called for a change in the law after a rape case against him was dropped by police			1
@entity8 , 48 , said he was maliciously targeted by a former lover and called for those accused of rape to be allowed anonymity until they are charged			1
the mp for @entity14 said the law on sex offences – which grants alleged victims anonymity but not the accused – should be reviewed so that ‘ fairness plays a greater role ’			1
but the same protection is not granted to the alleged perpetrator			2
critics claim the system is unfair because it allows innocent suspects to have their reputation dragged through the mud			0
but the government has defended the system - with many mps arguing that naming suspects has often encouraged other victims to come forward , helping to convict attackers who may otherwise have escaped justice			2
@entity48 today said there were ‘ real issues ’ with rape suspects anonymity			2
he said : ' i think it needs very careful thought before going down that road			0
' but the outspoken backbencher could face a fresh police inquiry after revealing sensitive details that could identify the woman who accused him			1
among his remarks , mr @entity8 disclosed that the pair were in a ‘ consenting ’ relationship , described the woman as ‘ single , well - educated ’ and gave her approximate age			1
senior figures in the criminal justice system will take a dim view of mr @entity8 ’s actions if they threaten to discourage other women from contacting police			1
last night @entity73 refused to be drawn on whether the politician has broken the law but a spokesman said it would ‘ assess ’ any complaint carefully			2
mr @entity8 ’s ordeal began in early december when he attended @entity81 police station in @entity82 and was arrested over the rape claim			1
speaker @entity84 published details of the arrest in a commons daily order paper			0
but after six weeks on bail mr @entity8 – who divorced his wife @entity25 in 2013 – was told yesterday he will face no further action as there is not enough evidence			1
speaking outside the @entity93 , mr @entity8 claimed the woman had ‘ concocted a vindictive and outrageous story ’			1
‘ to be falsely accused of anything is an awful thing , ’ he said			2
‘ sadly , as an mp , sometimes you have a target on your back			0
of course she remains anonymous			0
the law on anonymity does need to be reviewed and fairness does need to play a far greater role in these cases			1
’ mr @entity8 is a prominent member of the @entity107 and a leading @entity108 who was secretary of the @entity110 of @entity1 backbenchers mr @entity8 , mp for @entity14 in @entity112 , was arrested and questioned by police on tuesday following an allegation that he raped a woman earlier this year @entity8 is one of @entity117 's most - colourful mps – a self - made businessman who grew up in an orphanage before entering the @entity119 in 2005			1
the @entity1 backbencher is one of the party 's most eurosceptic mps and admitted that he came close to joining @entity123 earlier this year			2
since his election almost a decade ago , mr @entity8 has been involved in a series of high profile political clashes – including with the prime minister			1
during the 2005 leadership election he asked @entity48 if he had ever taken a @entity131 drugs			0
he was also briefly the toast of the @entity1 backbenches after taking on commons speaker @entity84 – shouting at him that he was ' not f * * * * * * royalty '			0
he added : ‘ the last few weeks have been a testing time			0
i ’m glad it ’s all over			0
’ victims of rape and other sexual offences were given anonymity under the 1976 @entity34			2
government ministers , prosecutors and police chiefs are desperate to encourage victims of sex crimes to come forward			1
new figures are expected to show that the number of rape cases going to court has risen significantly after years of decline			0
legal expert @entity151 said mr @entity8 ’s comments will be examined closely and could land him in court			1
‘ regardless of the outcome of any police inquiry or prosecution , anyone who makes an allegation of rape is entitled to anonymity for life , ’ he said			1
‘ any comment that identifies the victim to anyone by revealing specific details is potentially a breach of the law			2
’ he added : ‘ @entity168 has been quite aggressive in pursuing that kind of publication as it could put off others from coming forward			0
’ mr @entity8 ’s call for those accused of rape to be granted anonymity has re-ignited a long - running debate			1
he was backed by fellow @entity1 mp and former deputy speaker @entity177 , who was cleared last year of a string of sex offences			1
mr @entity177 said : ‘ sex crimes have a special stigma … i know the weight that will have been lifted from his shoulders … that has been progressively crushing him for the past six weeks			1
’ but @entity186 made it clear the government is unlikely to revisit the issue after a 2012 review found it could interfere with the judicial process			0
speaking on local radio , prime minister @entity48 said it ‘ needs very careful thought before going down that road ’			0
last year , @entity8 and his estranged wife became embroiled in a row on @entity198 over who was to blame for the break - up of their marriage			1
in july 2013 , @entity203 , wife of @entity8 , allegedly used the website to accuse her husband of ' abandoning her by text message after 16 years of marriage ' even though he claimed to be a ' devout @entity208 '			1
under ' spouse ' it refered to his wife by her maiden name of @entity213 and added that divorce was pending			0
shortly afterwards the entry was deleted			0
but a tit - for - tat wiki war ensued as the account of their split was changed on the mp 's profile , reflecting conflicting versions of events			2
most of the alterations were made from computers traced to the @entity226 where both worked at the time – mrs @entity203 as her husband 's commons office manager			0
even more remarkably , some of the anonymous @entity233 entries appeared to involve a code which echoed opera buff mr @entity8 's role as treasurer of the parliamentary opera group			1
one of the entries favourable to him was made by a user known as @entity240 , after @entity242 's @entity241			0
in a statement , he confirmed he had texted her to say he wanted a divorce but claimed he had already informed her ' in person '			0
he said : ' i informed my ex-wife , in person , that i was going to file for divorce the day i left home			0
over subsequent days , i confirmed that decision through another conversation , a legal letter , and by text			0
' since then , friends claim she may have abused the @entity233 site to try to cause me embarrassment and make inaccurate claims			0
i did not edit any item on my wiki page			0
' the ' text ' claim was added to mr @entity8 's profile on august 1 : ' the couple separated in april 2013 , following mr @entity8 , a devout @entity208 , abandoning @entity25 and the marriage on 29th april by text			1
' mr @entity8 's fightback started on august 6 , when allegations against him were deleted by @entity240			2
the only mention of his wife of the wikipedia page now reads : ' in july 2013 , @entity8 announced that he was divorcing his wife of 15 years , @entity25 , following their separation in april 2013			2

@entity8 was arrested and questioned over the allegation last month
the outspoken 48 - year - old represents the *wrekin* in @entity112
@entity283 was questioned for 4 hours over the allegation in december
