@entity1 host @entity0 in saturday 's lunchtime kick - off , looking to avenge their humiliating 6 - 3 defeat by @entity5 's side at the @entity7 last season			1
the @entity8 are unbeaten after a win against @entity10 and draws with @entity11 and @entity12 , while the champions suffered a surprise home loss to @entity15 last time out			1
it 's sure to be an intriguing battle at the @entity19 , but who will come out on top ? @entity23 's @entity22 evaluates each team to decide			1
@entity31 - 7.5 looks like he 's been at @entity1 a long time			1
enjoys defending and plays with aggression			0
@entity31 has settled in quickly at @entity1 after joining from @entity34 during the summer @entity35 - 7.5 great start to his @entity1 career and so mature for his age , but today will be his biggest test			1
@entity40 - 8 he 's got pace , is tenacious in his defending and reads it well			2
has to be on his a game			2
@entity40 is certain to start in the heart of the @entity8 ' back four against @entity0 @entity44 - 7 lovely left back but still to prove he 's top - class			1
a run of games without injuries would help			0
@entity49 - 8 technically fantastic and vital as captain , but in big games his lack of pace can show him up			2
@entity54 - 8 @entity55 did well in this game last year so he could play			2
@entity54 offers more going forward			0
@entity54 should be in confident mood after anchoring @entity59 's midfield against @entity60 @entity61 - 9 lf he 's fit , he has to play			2
he drives this team forward and has become one of @entity65 's best midfielders			2
@entity66 - 9 great credentials and a big goal against @entity69 to get started			0
lots of competition but such an important player			0
@entity66 already has two @entity1 goals to his name after arriving from @entity75 for £ 30million @entity76 - 8.5 i do n't know what his best foot is but he 's a magician			1
has technique , balance and bravery			0
@entity83 - 8 if he needs motivation , he got it from @entity85			1
no excuses now — needs to get in good positions and score			0
@entity83 looks set to make his debut against @entity0 after joining @entity1 on deadline day @entity90 - 87.5/110 @entity91 - 8 the pressure is off after winning the @entity93 but he still needs midfield and defensive cover			1
@entity83 is a good signing and @entity91 is now one of our greatest hopes for producing good @entity100 players			1
power off the bench - 8.5 per @entity103 and @entity55 provide plenty of defensive experience while @entity106 , if he 's fit , is capable of moments of magic if @entity91 needs to get creative			1
@entity109 - 9 overcame difficulties last season but impressive for @entity59 and now in the top five in the world			2
@entity109 ( left ) makes a brave punch during the 3 - 1 win against @entity0 at the @entity7 @entity116 - 9 love him			1
epitomises everything good about foreign players in the @entity120			2
plays with energy and passion			0
@entity123 - 9 can struggle with injuries but a colossus and one of the best centre backs in @entity120 history			1
captain @entity123 will be aiming for a clean sheet when his side visit the @entity19 on saturday @entity131 - 7.5 bit of a laughing stock when he arrived but answered his critics			1
with @entity137 around , he has to keep it up			0
@entity139 - 7.5 @entity140 with @entity141 so stays fresh			1
not much between the two but @entity139 can be vulnerable			2
@entity142 - 8 underestimated but very talented			1
will need some earplugs because he 'll get plenty of stick			0
@entity142 will face a hostile atmosphere when he returns to his former club @entity1 @entity149 - 8 a disappointing @entity150 but comfortable on the ball and a good minder for @entity153			1
@entity153 - 9 monster of a midfielder			0
yet to hit the heights of last year but it 's only a matter of time			0
@entity153 is the driving force in @entity0 's midfield but he has not found top form yet @entity162 - 9 a maestro			1
has balance , poise and genius in his feet			0
i could watch him all day			0
@entity171 - 9 one of the best in the world , barring injuries			0
with a good run , he 's a goal - a - game man			1
@entity171 bends the ball beyond @entity179 to seal a 2 - 0 win at @entity34 in @entity15 's first game of the season @entity183 - 8 no longer just a super sub			1
improving under @entity5 and playing with the confidence strikers need			0
@entity90 - 93/110 @entity5 - 8 the antithesis of @entity188			0
does n't fall out with his senior players and looks to get them on side			0
poor result against @entity15 , so he will not want another			0
@entity0 have not lost two straight league games since october 2010			2
power off the bench - 8 excellent defensive options in @entity198 and @entity137			0
@entity199 can stretch a game or @entity201 can shore it up , but with @entity203 out they are light on attacking options .			0

@entity1 host @entity0 at the @entity19 in *sunday* 's lunchtime game
the @entity8 lost 6 - 3 to the champions at the @entity7 last season
the match sees @entity142 and @entity139 face their former side

@entity83 looks set to make his debut after joining @entity91 's side on *transfer* deadline day from @entity223
both sides hope to be battling for the @entity120 title come may
