@entity0 made his mind up to leave @entity2 last april after they lost in the @entity3 to @entity4 and the @entity6 midfielder sensed a trophyless season was going to end with an almighty shake - up that could well include him			1
sure enough , @entity2 finished the campaign empty handed and manager @entity11 was replaced by @entity12			2
@entity0 spoke to the club ’s sporting director @entity13 on the phone a week after the season ended			1
@entity0 told @entity17 : ‘ i called @entity13 and i knew by the response that i got that i was doing them a favour – it was the best thing for them and for me			2
@entity0 has always had an affiliation with the capital ever since sharing digs with @entity44 when he moved to the city as a 16 - year - old from @entity2			1
asked by a @entity48 journalist recently if he felt ‘ @entity49 ’ , @entity0 replied : ‘ more than @entity49 i feel like a @entity39 ’ and with wife @entity50 also a fan he was always likely to favour a move to a @entity39 club over the mooted switch to either @entity55 or @entity56			1
fabregas in action for @entity24 where he spent eight years before joining @entity2 in the summer of 2011 the irony of his failure to fit back in at @entity2 was that while his off - the - field friendship with @entity63 was stronger than ever – the two were reunited having been in the same under 13 side as schoolboys at @entity2 ’s @entity67 academy – the pair were difficult to fit into the same team on the pitch			2
@entity63 had become the archetypal ‘ false 9 ’ at the @entity73 , operating as a withdrawn centre - forward			0
@entity0 did the same job for @entity6 at the 2012 @entity75			2
the former @entity24 captain loves to arrive in the space between the oppostion ’s central defenders and holding midfielders but that was @entity63 territory			0
fabregas lines up for @entity2 against @entity84 in his final season with the @entity87 giants @entity0 ( second right ) lines up alongside @entity88 ( third left ) and @entity63 ( front left ) for @entity2 in ' 03 @entity91 changed @entity2 ’s 4 - 3 - 3 system to a 3 - 4 - 3 in 2011 so that @entity63 could stay as the team ’s deep - lying centre forward and @entity0 could operate at the top of a midfield diamond			1
the two dove - tailed brilliantly at first but the strains of playing a back three soon meant the system was binned and so began the conundrum of finding a place for @entity0			0
while @entity63 and partner @entity104 stepped out with @entity0 and @entity50 more and more and both couples had new - born children to tighten the bonds , @entity0 found himself stepping out on to the pitch with @entity63 less and less			0
in reference to being left out of @entity2 ’s @entity108 semi-final humiliation to @entity109 in 2013 he told @entity110 : ' if you play one game , the next , and the next but then comes the big game away to @entity109 and we are losing 4 - 0 and you are not even warming up then it gets you down			0
' he still scored 42 goals in 150 games and won the trophies that had eluded him at @entity24 and the admiration of @entity23 who made his move this summer			0

former @entity24 skipper @entity124 will line up against his old club when @entity25 face the @entity127 on sunday the @entity25 midfielder slides in on @entity129 during @entity25 's @entity108 clash in @entity131 @entity132 manager @entity23 and @entity0 at @entity25 's training hq earlier this week @entity124 ' record at @entity2 and @entity25			1

the @entity25 star chose to leave @entity2 after they lost to @entity4
@entity0 spoke to the club 's sporting director after the season finished
following that *conversation* he told his agent @entity35 to find him a new club in the @entity145 with @entity39 his preferred destination
@entity24 had first *refusal* on @entity124 but @entity25 *swooped* for @entity6 star
