the method behind the madness of @entity3 's infamous rousing speeches has been revealed in an album of extraordinary photographs			1
the incredible pictures show the dictator rehearsing for his hate - filled monologues using a range of bizarre expressions and hand gestures			1
the nine photos were taken by his personal photographer @entity13 to give the @entity14 an insight into how he looked to the @entity17 public			1
the pictures , taken in the late 1920s , show @entity3 pointing at a pretend audience , raising a clenched fist , opening his palms as if imploring a crowd to stand up and frowning angrily			1
a separate photo shows him in an absurdly camp pose , wearing lederhosen and leaning against a tree			1

another image has him staring seriously at the camera wearing an @entity55 cap - which he never wore again upon seeing the ridiculous pictures			1
the @entity55 - or @entity55 - were @entity3 's storm troopers , also known as brownshirts , which later became overshadowed by the @entity59 the photos , which were never intended to be seen , survived the war and have now been published alongside a range of portraits of @entity3 , from the chilling to the comical			1

they were later published in his little - known memoir , @entity3 was my friend , in the 1950s and have now been released in @entity77 to be seen by the general public			1
they capture the meticulous training @entity3 undertook to perfect his famous speeches , and give a rare insight into his vanity and controlling personality			1
photographer @entity13 ( above ) , who introduced @entity3 to his then - studio assistant @entity85 , survived the war and spent four years in prison for @entity48 profiteering			1
he died in 1957 , aged 72 the photos were later published in @entity91 's little - known memoir , @entity3 was my friend , in the 1950s and have now been released in @entity77 @entity92 , a historian who wrote the introduction to the new book , said : ' it makes perfect sense that he would be doing this			1
' we have this image now of @entity3 almost as a buffoon , but he had a lot of charisma and his speeches made people sincerely believe he would lead them back to greatness			1
' he was an absolutely spellbinding public speaker and these pictures show that it was something he worked very hard on			1
' when you listen to his speeches now , he sounds like a ranting , raving maniac , but we know that it came across in a very persuasive way			1
' these pictures give an important insight into how he practised			2
he was a showman and rehearsed his gestures to get a particular reaction from his audiences			2
' he experimented with his own image and asked @entity13 to take photographs for him to review			2
then he 'd look at them and say " no , that looks silly " or " i 'm never doing that again "			2
' he used @entity13 as a sounding board , but never intended the images to be published			2
' he was a very modern politician in that way			2
he was concerned about how he looked and his public persona			2

the @entity23 and the power of oratory standing on a podium before thousands of @entity141 members , @entity3 crossed his arms ... and waited a full minute before starting to speak			0
the audience had already been kept waiting over an hour for his arrival into the hall			0
when it came to making speeches , the @entity23 was a master of manipulation and presentation			0
in the early years of his rise to power , he often spoke in @entity151 - and tailored his style of talking accordingly as the crowds became more inebriated			0
he would begin precisely , logically and in a restrained manner			0
but as his audience warmed to him - and had drunk more - he would launch into a ranting , raving , almost hypnotic speech style			0
@entity3 was fascinated by mesmerism and even hired a voice trainer to hone this talent			0
by 1932 , @entity17 production had fallen by half , with 6million unemployed during the depression			0
so in order to sway the masses , @entity3 would speak of his vision of a ' great national revival '			0
and his largest asset was his oratory			0
@entity170 , the son of @entity3 's foreign press officer , said during a recent documentary , fatal attraction of @entity3 : ' he had that ability which is needed to make people stop thinking critically and just emote			0
' the ability derived from his readiness to throw himself totally open - to appear bare and naked before his audience , to tear open his heart and display it			0
' and he displayed well			0
