by @entity0 published : 08:42 est , 18 march 2014 updated : 11:40 est , 18 march 2014 after 54 - years , federal scientists have said they have recovered one of the last bottle 's set adrift by the government to track ocean currents			1
@entity8 discovered the clear glass soda bottle containing a pink sheet that reads ' @entity11 ' while walking in @entity12 on @entity13 on december 22 , 2013			2
the bottle contained a postcard with a @entity17 stamp dated september 19 , 1959 with instructions on how to return it to authorities if found			1
recovered : this is the bottle found on the beach at @entity13 that was set adrift in an experiment more than 54 - years ago keeping the bottle till february 20 , @entity8 was able to remove the stopper - thereby ensuring that the bottle remained intact			1
he took it to the @entity29 of the @entity30 who explained to @entity8 that the bottle was the last of series of bottles released between 1958 and 1966 to chart ocean currents			1
drift bottles have been in use to track ocean currents since 1846			1
' the postcard had both stamped and handwritten information on the top : @entity43 & @entity42 was stamped on the left corner , and september 19 , 1959 on the right corner , with the day handwritten			1
' in the middle , just above the printed words “ @entity49 ” and instructions below , was the handwritten number @entity52 , written twice , ' said a report in the @entity54			0
experiment : it is probable that it was launched from either the vessel explorer or @entity59 in the 1950 's or 1960 's			2
it is remarkable that the bottle survived for close to fifty years			2
historic : these are the leaflets left inside the bottle set adrift more than 50 - years ago in @entity65 more than 50 - years floating : while the @entity30 do not know the precise movements of the bottle - they know it was set adrift from @entity69 in 1959 and washed up at @entity12 in 2013 @entity17 refers to the @entity17 , which was created in 1807 as the @entity70 and expanded as the @entity71 expanded westward			1
the agency was renamed in 1878 and is currently part of @entity30			0
archived documents revealed that in september and october of 1959 , the @entity75 conducted environmental studies in three areas off the @entity78 : 16 miles northeast of @entity79 , just south of @entity69 , and 36 miles south of @entity80 on @entity13			2
records from march 1960 indicated that four of the six bottles numbered @entity52 released south of @entity69 were recovered within two months of their september 19 , 1959 release			1
another one after 2 days , another after 4 days , and a third after 7 days			0
all three were found on @entity13			0
the fourth was found after 55 days on @entity86			0
this means that the december 2013 bottle is one of the last two bottles dropped into the sea from those six			2
but , just like the others it was recovered near to where it was released - in this case more than 54 - years later			0
' finding the bottle was exciting , ' @entity8 told the @entity54			0
' learning more about it and its history has been a rewarding experience , to say the least			0
i never expected to find something like this , but then again , you never know what you will find on the beach			0
