@entity0 , 39 , stopped her son @entity1 , 10 , from going on the mosque trip , expressing fears of ' violence and guns ' children as young as eight have been banned by their parents from attending a @entity10 mosque as part of a school trip over ' safety ' fears , with one mother claiming she ' does n't want to put her son at risk of being shot '			1
nearly 100 primary pupils from @entity19 in @entity20 were due to travel 68 miles to visit the mosque in @entity22 , @entity23 , as part of an re trip to learn about different faiths			1
the schoolchildren , from years three to six , were due to visit the city 's cathedral before taking a tour of the mosque and observing a congregational prayer			2
however , about 10 pupils have now pulled out of next week 's school trip after their parents said they would be exposed to ' violence and guns ' and expressed ' grave concerns ' about the teaching of @entity38			1
@entity39 , 47 , a housewife from @entity40 , @entity20 , has stopped her 10 - year - old daughter @entity41 going on the visit			1
she said : ' we are not the only ones that do n't want our kids to go - but a lot of the others have n't been honest enough to do so in the consent form			0
' i do not want my daughter going to the mosque for personal reasons			2
i do n't agree with the religion and what it stands for - but i am not prepared to go into the reasons why			0
' we have now been told our children are going to be excluded from re lessons as a result , which is a big concern			0
' we tried to go through the right channels but the school handled it very badly			0
' @entity0 , 39 , a self - employed cleaner from @entity63 , @entity20 , has also blocked her son @entity1 , 10 , from going on the visit			1
she said : ' i did not want him to go because they are a violent religion and many of them have guns			2
' you can see what they are like every day on the news			0
there was a @entity77 bomber in @entity22 just a few years ago			1
' we were just being honest saying we did not want them to go			0
i do n't want my son being shot			0
also this is not a religious school yet they are willing to take a whole day out for religion			0
' i do n't want them to do that			0
i want him to be in school learning maths and @entity89 - not being put at risk of being shot			0
' they decided to take him out of @entity93 , but i said i am fine with that			1
' nearly 100 primary pupils from @entity19 in @entity20 were due to travel 68 miles to visit the mosque in @entity22 , @entity23 ( pictured ) as part of an re trip but 10 pulled out after parents expressed ' grave concerns ' another parent , who did not want to be named , said : ' we have grave concerns about the children 's safety during the trip due to the horrific events that occur every day			1
' we have therefore decided not to send our children on this trip			2
this decision is not one based on ignorance or racial or religious beliefs , but one based purely on safety concerns			2
' the parent said she was furious after the pupils who pulled out of the trip were singled out in a school assembly			1
she said : ' they were made to stand up after assembly			0
the sitting non-attendees were then asked individually why they were not going on the trip			2
' this is not a decision the children have made , so discriminating against these children in this fashion is disgraceful , unacceptable and unprofessional			0
' however , not all parents are opposed to the trip , with some backing the school and suggesting the visit is a positive move			1
@entity131 , 35 , a playworker from @entity40 , said : ' i think we need to educate our children to be tolerant and dispel the rumours the media can congregate			0
' i am all for my children going on the trip			2
i think celebrating diversity is a great thing			0
' it is all down to fear			0
people are scared of other religions			0
there is a lot of misconceptions			0
' and @entity147 , 41 , a self - employed retailer , from @entity40 , added : ' ' i did not even realise it was an issue			0
i was delighted my child had the opportunity to experience another culture in their ways of worship			2
' i think it is important to celebrate other cultures - even if you do n't agree with them			0
' @entity160 , headteacher of @entity19 ( pictured ) , which has just 156 pupils on its books , said the trip would still take place on may 7 to ' show children the views of extremists are not a true reflection of @entity38 ' @entity171 , the chairman of governors for the school , said a group of parents had expressed concerns about the trip due to recent terror attacks by groups such as @entity180			1
she said : ' this is the first time pupils from the school have visited a mosque and it 's an exciting opportunity for them to learn about different faiths and ensure that they 're aware of the diverse nature of modern @entity10			1
' because of recent news reports about extremist groups , such as @entity180 , that identify themselves with @entity38 , a small number of parents have expressed concerns about the trip and the teaching of @entity38 in school			1
' in response , the school held a special assembly with children to discuss these issues , and the head teacher has met and sent letters to parents with specific concerns			1
' a full risk assessment has been conducted for the trip and there is no more risk attached to this trip than any other school trip			2
' ms @entity171 said the school had a duty under the @entity213 to promote good relations between people of different beliefs and ethnicities			2
she said : ' @entity93 forms part of the basic curriculum in schools and its teaching is enshrined in law			1
@entity171 , the chairman of governors for the @entity19 , said parents expressed concerns about the teaching of @entity38 at the school ' the school recognises that parents have the right to withdraw their child from @entity93 in whole or in part , and provide alternative work to further their child 's knowledge and understanding of the parents ' beliefs and values			1
' however , the school is aware that children growing up in @entity20 may have little contact with @entity244 and it is aware that it has a duty under the @entity213 to promote good relations between people of different beliefs and ethnicities as part of its single equality duty			1
' the @entity252 fully supports this trip and the teaching of @entity93 , including @entity38			1
' it is the governors ' hope that the visit to the mosque will provide an insight for pupils into the nature of @entity38 , help them understand how @entity38 is presented in the media and that groups like @entity180 are not a true reflection of the @entity38 followed by the vast majority of @entity244 in @entity10			1
' @entity160 , headteacher of the primary school which has just 156 pupils on its books and teaches those aged four to 11 , said the trip would still be taking place on may 7			1
she said : ' our hope from the visit to the mosque is that children will be given a view as to what are the values and beliefs of a @entity77			2
' this trip will show the children the views of extremists are not a true reflection of @entity38 as a religion			2
' @entity287 , described as the ' @entity288 of the @entity289 ' , is open daily for prayers and also welcomes those wishing to learn about the @entity292 and basics of the @entity294			0
the mosque also welcomes groups as part of education programmes and regularly hosts school trips			1
@entity19 , which has around six teachers , said the trip was planned to enable children to learn further about different religions			1
the school said it follows the @entity305 for @entity93 and part of the curriculum encourages children to study @entity309 in great detail , as well as finding out about @entity311 , @entity312 , @entity313 and @entity38 through school trips , visits from outside speakers and class teaching			1
the @entity318 said it was concerned by the views of some of the parents who strongly opposed the trip			2
a spokesman said : ' we would have thought a well - rounded education involves learning about those of a different faith			0
' these laudable initiatives take place across the country			0
it is therefore disappointing to hear that some parents have chosen to pull their children out of a visit to a mosque due to events elsewhere in the world			1
' we hope this incident is atypical and not reflective of a growing sentiment against @entity244 in this country			0
' we commend the headteacher for rightly stating that such a visit will help her pupils to understand real @entity38 and dispel the myths and hysteria that surrounds our religion			0
' @entity347 has contacted @entity287 for comment .			0

10 pupils pull out of trip to mosque after parents express ' grave concerns '

@entity19 in @entity20 planned @entity93 trip to @entity22 mosque next week
however , other parents backed trip to promote education of various faiths
