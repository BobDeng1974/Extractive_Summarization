@entity7 had been in daily telephone contact with mr @entity1 since his admission to hospital last sunday			1
now as mr @entity1 fights for his life , @entity6 has been told that ms @entity7 is ‘ living moment by moment , ’ unable to contact him and tormented by the knowledge that that she and her 13 - year - old son and two nephews currently quarantined with her , could develop symptoms at any time			1
prayers were offered up on sunday for ms @entity7 , mr @entity1 and all affected by this , the first @entity22 outbreak on @entity24 soil , at @entity25 , @entity26 , where ms @entity7 is a member			1
she is currently in quarantine , but churchgoers prayed for her at the service on sunday speaking to @entity6 following the service senior pastor @entity39 , who is in daily contact with ms @entity7 , gave the first insight into how the woman at the center of the crisis is coping as mr @entity1 ’s condition worsens			1
he said , ‘ she is struggling to manage really with all the consequences of @entity49 ’s illness and the fear of what might happen to him			0
senior pastor @entity39 has revealed that @entity7 is a naturalized @entity24 citizen ‘ and with the minute by minute question of what might be happening to her and to her son and nephews who are with her in quarantine			1
’ it is two days since ms @entity7 and the other quarantined occupants of the now infamous @entity61 were moved to a secret location in a gated community within city limits			1
county judge @entity65 who said that the faith community had donated the home drove the family there personally			0
a @entity25 spokesman today confirmed that they were supporting the move financially and had been providing meals for the family			0
the location was chosen by mayor @entity75 and mr @entity65			0
according to pastor @entity39 , ‘ @entity7 is doing better since being moved to another house			2
that is giving her a sense of relief but she is eager for this to be over			0
’ this is the second tragedy to befall ms @entity7 who is regarded as the matriarch of her large family , pastor @entity39 revealed			1
earlier this year one her three adult daughters died in childbirth in @entity31 at the age of 38			1
two daughters remained in @entity31 when ms @entity7 moved to the @entity24 more than a decade ago after a ‘ falling out ’ with mr @entity1 by whom she has a 19 - year - old son , currently a student in @entity89			1
ms @entity7 ’s other adult daughter , @entity90 , 35 , lives in @entity26 and is in quarantine along with her four children ages 2 to 11 having tended to mr @entity1 and traveled with him to hospital last sunday			1
her husband @entity94 , 43 , was last week told by @entity96 officials that he could return to work as a nursing assistant			0
’ according to pastor @entity39 , mr @entity99 visited @entity100 earlier this year and , ‘ reconnected with @entity49			2
’ he explained , ‘ their relationship never led to marriage in @entity31 , but in recent times she had returned to @entity100 and they had reconnected and he was eager to come to the @entity3			2
’ after so many years living in the @entity24 , ms @entity7 is a naturalized citizen , pastor @entity39 said			1
mr @entity1 entered the country on a tourist visa but his forthcoming marriage could have sped the process for his own naturalization or green card if he chose to apply			2
pastor @entity39 said , ‘ he had applied for a visa and it had taken quite a while to come through so he was excited when actually he got the visa and was planning to come here and visit with me about having a wedding and starting a new life			0
he was looking forward to seeing the woman he loved and reconnect with his son			0
’ he added , ‘ i think it ’s important to know that chronology			0
this was not a quick decision to leave @entity31 upon a sense of his having been exposed			2
’ just how ‘ eager ’ mr @entity1 was to come to @entity24 – and remain here – has been a subject of intense scrutiny and controversy across the past week			1
@entity1 was eager to come to the @entity24 so he could marry ms @entity7 , with him he has a 19 - year - old son pastor @entity39 said the @entity137 congregation is supporting ms @entity7 in her quarantine and have secured the home she is currently staying in with her children @entity31 authorities have now claimed that he lied on exit documents , answering ‘ no ’ to specific questions regarding whether or not he had been in contact with or involved in the treatment of someone infected with the ebola virus			1
pastor @entity39 said that he had addressed this revelation with members of his church			0
he said , ‘ if he did lie he will be held accountable and it 's not up to us to stand in the way of that process			0
‘ but he has n’t had a chance to give his own account and let ’s be honest , @entity31 has good reason to not want to appear to have messed up here			2
’ the day before he had been due to leave @entity31 , mr @entity1 carried a pregnant @entity22 sufferer to her home where she later died			1
addressing the anger this revelation has prompted , pastor @entity39 said , ‘ let ’s be honest			0
he had just been holding this pregnant young woman in his arms and taken her home because she could not get care in @entity31 and watched her die			2
‘ and even if he knew he was exposed , that is – if he were to stay – what he would know would be the outcome very soon for him			0
‘ if he came to @entity24 with the best health care system in the world and acknowledgement worldwide that we have had aid workers who had contracted this and who have recovered he would know he stood a chance			2
‘ i do n’t excuse him if he did intentionally conceal that information			0
but it ’s certainly understandable that he might have			0
’ however ‘ understandable ’ mr @entity1 ’s motivations , the recklessness of his alleged lie in order to secure his transit to the @entity3 has now put the lives of all who came into direct contact with him in danger , as well as countless others ’ should the @entity193 fail to contain the virus			2
yesterday their assertion that the situation was under control was dealt a severe blow with @entity96 ’s admission that they had ‘ lost ’ the homeless man who had travelled in the ambulance in which mr @entity1 had been vomiting violently			0
but , for now , pastor @entity39 said his focus , and that of his church was on providing what support they can for ms @entity7 as her fiancés condition worsens			1
he said , ‘ we have assured her that until the end of this period of 21 days that she has to endure , regardless of the outcome of @entity49 ’s illness , positive or negative , we ’ll walk beside her and help her to rebuild her life as much as possible			0
