the misogynistic character was officially killed off by his creator last month after a storm of accusations over sexism			2
however , @entity6 's @entity5 could soon be coaxed out of retirement after making the nominees for @entity9 at next february 's @entity10			1
the nomination has been awarded on a technicality - bands and solo artists are eligible for a place on the list if they have had a single or album in the @entity33 in the past year			1
the only official rule preventing an artist getting onto the list is a nomination for a @entity10 or track in the charts in a previous year			1
neither the death of a character , nor causing the offence of a nation , are enough to get @entity5 blacklisted from the category			1
a @entity10 spokesman told the @entity44 : ' bands are eligible for @entity10 category if they have had an @entity49 @entity33 single and / or artist album chart success in the current eligibility period			1
@entity51 has designed the winners ' trophy for the @entity10 2015 ' they are not eligible if they have previously been nominated in any @entity10 category ( excluding critics ’ choice ) or had an @entity49 top 30 single and / or artist album prior to the period			1
' a panel of music industry experts will be whittling the current longlist down to five for the shortlist			0
the public are then able to choose from the final list in an online vote in the weeks running up to the music event			2
given that @entity5 includes lyrics such as , ' if she 's looking at me but playing with her hair , by the end of the night she 'll need a wheelchair , ' it is unlikely that the family - friendly brits panel will be nominating dapper for his musical efforts at the 2015 awards			1
and even if he was given one of the coveted shortlist slots , it is unknown whether @entity6 would turn up at @entity13 's @entity84 for the ceremony			0
@entity6 announced he was killing off @entity5 on @entity86 in november in november , the @entity13 declared ' @entity5 is gone , ' on @entity87 's @entity86 after a wave of negative headlines about his comedy routine			2
in the same week , the huge backlash against his sexist jokes , which include telling men ' just show her your penis ' and ' if she cries , she ’s just playing hard to get , ' also saw @entity99 announce that it would no longer commission his programme on the pull			0
he said at the time : ' i did n't think that so many people would end up seeing it			0
' in the end it became very popular and i kind of got a bit carried away with it , to be honest with you			0
' it 's wrong but , to me , i did n't see it as me who was saying it , i was creating this character and i was really pushing the boundaries with this character because it was popular			0
' i thought that the people that were viewing it were saying this is ridiculous and laughing at it			0
' at 2014 's @entity10 , the award was given to the band @entity126 .			0

@entity5 is on long list of candidates for @entity9
all @entity24 artists with debut single in @entity33 in last year are included
he is one of more than 90 acts on the long list for the 2015 category
