@entity0 and @entity1 are expected to be named as @entity3 ’s centre pairing to face the @entity4 on saturday as @entity5 tries yet another midfield combination			1
without @entity8 ( groin ) and @entity10 ( hand ) , @entity7 is understood to favour @entity13 rugby league convert @entity14 and @entity15 stalwart @entity1 in a bid to repeat the shock victory his side pulled off over the world champions two years ago			1
@entity0 , 25 , has been the form no 12 in the @entity22 this season while the trusted @entity1 has impressed since returning from injury three weeks ago and is set to be named in the outside centre position			1
@entity1 passes the ball during the @entity3 training session held at @entity28 @entity0 of @entity29 moves away from @entity30 during the @entity31 between the @entity4 and @entity3 at @entity32 on june 7 , 2014 in @entity33 ‘ @entity1 brings a huge amount defensively and physically and he is a very good reader of the defence and sets the defensive tone , ’ said @entity5 this week			1
‘ he has improved his decision - making and his ability to get over the gain line			0
his performance against the @entity42 [ on tour last summer ] was his best in an @entity3 shirt for a while			0
he is a strong leader within the team			0
he wants to improve , he has great humility and he is definitely improving in all areas			0
’ @entity0 — who weighs just 80kg — was outstanding alongside @entity8 in the first test in the summer before being harshly dropped for the second and then struggling when recalled for the third			2
but his form has been so good for @entity13 at the start of this season it looks certain he will be picked ahead of @entity53 and @entity54 — assuming he has recovered from the rib injury picked up on club duty a fortnight ago			0
@entity57 ( left ) the @entity3 backs coach talks to @entity1 during an @entity3 training session @entity8 shakes hands with @entity1 after their @entity61 match with @entity62 earlier this year			2

@entity1 and @entity0 are to start for @entity3 against the @entity4
the duo are set to line up as the centre pairing next saturday
@entity5 is without @entity8 and @entity10 through injury
