a four - month - old baby suffered 13 broken ribs and three skull fractures as a result of five separate incidents before her death , her inquest has heard			1
@entity7 died on february 21 , 2013 at the @entity8 in @entity9			1
a full @entity10 , reviewed by two radiologists , discovered numerous existing injuries			0
her father , @entity13 , 30 , was acquitted of assaulting the young baby at an earlier trial at @entity16			1
the inquest heard that the injuries suffered by @entity7 , pictured , could have happened over five occasions her father , @entity13 , pictured , had been acquitted of assaulting his daughter on an earlier occasion @entity7 's mother @entity23 , centre , said that she and her daughter had been ' failed by the justice system ' @entity13 had his daughter 's hand print tattooed onto his chest following her death in february 2013 the infant suffered from @entity33 syndrome which affected the development of her facial bones			1
medical investigations found that @entity7 was injured in five separate incidents , with a belief that the fractures could have been caused by ' squeezing or standing or stamping on the ribs by an adult '			1
however , medics admitted that the string of injuries did not contribute to @entity7 's death			1
the inquest in @entity47 heard that @entity7 suffered the same genetic illness as her father			1
she also suffered from colic which caused her pain , distress and discomfort			1
dr @entity54 , forensic pathologist said : ' there were many rib fractures on both sides of her chest and these were of varying ages			1
there was no disease process that would have made her more vulnerable to rib fractures and there was no accident explanation from the materials reviewed			1
' the pattern of ribs fractures is suggestive of multiple physical assault			1
these look like rib fractures as a consequence of direct hard blows or hard tight gripping			1
rib fractures can cause problems with breathing that are harmful and may have an influence on someone ’s death			1
' the inquest was told six of the thirteen rib fractures may have happened in the week leading up to her death and dr @entity54 added : ' they were of three different ages and caused by the application of blunt force			1
the force required would be quite considerable			0
' october 30 , 2012 : @entity7 is born december 2012 : @entity7 admitted to hospital having suffered ' a massive lump to her head february 21 , 2013 : @entity7 dies at the @entity8 in @entity9 november 26 2012 - february 22 2013 : @entity13 accused of assaulting his daughter between these dates			1
july 20 , 2014 : police claim @entity13 wanted to plead guilty to lesser offences , but this approach was rejected by the @entity98			0
october 29 , 2014 : @entity13 is acquitted by a jury at @entity16 of ten charges , including grievous bodily harm , following a six - day trial			1
december 9 , 2014 : an inquest in @entity47 returns an open verdict the inquest was told @entity7 had been previously admitted to hospital in december 2012 after suffering a ' massive lump ' to her head while in the charge of her father			1
@entity13 later claimed while he had been downstairs changing her nappy on a foot stool another small child fell on her and a toy telephone she was holding hit his daughter on the head			2
but dr @entity54 said : ' i examined the explanation in detail			0
it was my opinion that the incident described initially had not caused the skull fracture			2
i did n’t think it was plausible as a cause of the skull fracture			2
you need considerable impact to fracture a child ’s skull			2
' he told the inquest @entity7 may have died from ' non-accidental upper airway obstruction ' and added : ' for example by smothering			1
it can not be excluded as a cause of death			0
it may not leave any signs			0
upper airway obstruction by smothering can not be excluded as a potential cause of death			0
' rib fractures are a cause of pneumonia			2
the chest can become painful with rib fractures and it causes breathing difficulties			2
rib fractures may be one of the main causes of death in this case			2
' @entity13 from @entity154 , @entity9 , stood trial last october at @entity16 during which prosecutors said it was believed the skull fractures suffered by @entity7 were ' likely to have been caused by hitting her head against a flat surface or striking her head with a blunt instrument			1
' but he was acquitted of five charges of causing grievous bodily harm with intent between november 26 , 2012 and february 22 last year			2
mr @entity13 said after his trial he had undergone ' two years of hell ' until he was finally acquitted by the jury @entity13 also had a tattoo on his arm , pictured , featuring his daughter 's name commemorating her short life the inquest heard that @entity7 , pictured , had been found unresponsive in her @entity176 basket on the day she died detective superintendent @entity177 of @entity178 said : ' we know from both @entity13 and @entity23 at 6am on 21st of february @entity13 returned home after a night shift working at the @entity183 factory			1
he came home and when he arrived @entity7 was upstairs and when he came in he would go and collect her and take her down stairs			1
from his account he said he had been playing with her for an hour			0
' he said @entity13 told officers he put @entity188 in a @entity176 basket face down claiming he was told to lay her left cheek laying down on the mattress			1
but when he checked her again at 9.45am her face was fully facing into the mattress at which point she was unresponsive and the ambulance was called			2
miss @entity23 was also arrested but released without charge			0
mr @entity177 added : ' the @entity98 reviewed the case and evidence and we received advice to charge @entity13			0
on 20th july we were contacted by prosecution counsel stating that @entity13 ’s defence team had accepted guilty pleas to lesser offences			0
@entity13 accepted a momentary loss of control , but this was rejected by the @entity98			0
they said a charge on the basis of momentary loss of control did not reflect the series of assaults			0
' he went to a full not guilty trial and blamed @entity23			0
the jury acquitted him of all the charges and the cause of death remained unascertained			0
' recording an open verdict coroner @entity224 said : ' during her life @entity7 had sustained serious injuries and dr @entity54 detailed the force needed to inflict these injuries			1
' what can be said for certain is that there is no realistic explanation for how that child in her short life sustained 13 rib fractures and three skull fractures			1
' mr @entity13 waited until miss @entity23 and her family left the court before departing without comment after the hearing @entity13 waited until @entity241 and her family left the court before departing without comment			0
in an interview with his local newspaper after his acquittal he said : ' it ’s all such a big relief			0
all i ever wanted to do , and set out to do , was prove my innocence and now i have done that			0
' i ’ve been beaten up on the street and called names and for the last 20 months i ’ve been stuck in the house			0
i had to leave my job and i ’ve been suicidal , i tried taking my own life			0
you just would n’t believe how much of a weight off my shoulders it actually is			0
no - one can ever imagine or come close to imagining how i ’ve felt unless they go through it themselves			2
' i can now finally walk around the streets without looking over my shoulder and i can actually grieve properly for my daughter without any stress on my back			0
i was scared of people thinking i had done something			0
now i do n’t have to worry about that			0
' mr @entity13 denied he ever offered to accept a plea in connection with his earlier assault case			2
miss @entity23 said following the hearing : ' i feel i have been failed by the justice system - i just kept hoping that we would get some answers and we will get justice one day			2
