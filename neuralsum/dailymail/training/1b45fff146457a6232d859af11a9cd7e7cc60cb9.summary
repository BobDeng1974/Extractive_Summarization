modern women may be obsessed with hiding their bumps and bulges , but this archive of underwear catalogues reveals that not much has changed underneath our clothes in the last 100 years			1
the brochures - dating back to the 1890s - detail how lingerie has been cleverly deployed across the decades to win the battle of the bulge			2
they document the 1930s solid girdles , employed to accentuate a tiny waist , to the pointy bras of the 1950s to the high - tech control pants of today			1
we might think of @entity17 and control pants as a modern trend but these adverts show that women were using underwear to alter their shape as early as 1937 adverts from 1937 , featured in an underwear catalogue , boast that you can ' slim with safety - without diet or exercise '			1
they also highlight such features as the ' studless fastner ' which has no ' protruding studs ' the 1950s saw a wealth of girdle and corset - type underwear hit the market promising the perfect body the contraptions were given innovative names like ' hardware ' , ' health ' , ' grace ' and ' uplift ' the archive reveals the most popular shapewear garments sold by @entity47 , one @entity49 's oldest retailers			1
bust enhancers and reducers , waist control garments , and pants that can smooth a troublesome bottom , were all in fashion at some point over the last 14 decades			1
it shows how strong inflexible materials used in early designs were gradually replaced by more comfortable rubber and elastic , so women could look good both standing up and sitting down			1
@entity62 , lingerie buyer at @entity47 , said : ' we often take the smooth , comfortable , sophistication of today 's modern shapewear for granted			2
' however this archive shows the sacrifices that women have made in the past so that today 's generation can put their most natural looking , smoothest silhouette forward			2
' the pictures demonstrate how the control garment industry was at he forefront of using leading technology , using newly discovered , man - made materials , and often deploying them long before other markets realised their potential			2
as well as the advent of colour in popular magazines , the 1960s saw all - in - one corset attempt to create the ' glorious figure of youth ' this 1970s advert sees lycra incorporated into a design that promises slimmer waist , thighs and tummy subtle but incremental changes show the transformation to today 's shapewear , which is now developed using highly technical , computer designed architecture			1
components are engineered specifically to combat specific stresses and stretches , spreading the load across the entire garment for a smooth often seamless result			0
with more than 60 per cent of @entity49 women dealing with body image issues sales of shapewear have risen by 40 per cent at @entity47 in 2014			0
modern technology is now aimed at strength and comfort using fabric advances to create ranges such as the ' no @entity116 ' knicker			0
@entity47 includes a @entity118 range incorporating fabric technology that not only smooths the silhouette but is skin - care friendly by incorporating an anti-microbial ingredient in its core that lasts the lifetime of the garment , preventing bacteria growth and ultimately irritation			0
but @entity62 claims that even apparently slender celebrities such as @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity131 use control garment to boost their confidence at important events			0
' it has become clear in recent years that there is work to be done in filling the gap in the market felt by women who might not fit into the consumer 's ideal , but who do represent the consumer 's reality , ' she added			0
' we cater for women looking for a way to enhance their body confidence whatever their shape and size without the need for extreme dieting			0
' ' with an ageing population , increasing dress sizes and a growing propensity for home shopping we hope to inspire women to make them feel more confident shopping for fashion			0
' by the 1980s the strong inflexible materials used in early designs had been replaced by more comfortable rubber , elastic and @entity165 late 1980s spreads feature noticeably slimmer women showing off the shapewear the decade of choice , the 1990s advert features numerous variations of very similar control pants			1
