by celebrating the achievements and heritage of these people groups , @entity4 says : ' i seek the positivity of @entity7 country , i look for our heroes ; and we have them , they are walking among us			0
' they are health professionals , athletes and culture bearers ; they are our farmers that cultivate our indigenous seeds ; our fisherman who navigate our sacred waters ; our attorneys who protect our sovereignty ; our activists that stand in solidarity and our uncles and grandpa ’s who fight the good fight to protect our sacred sites and natural resources			0

so far @entity18 has taken several years and she hopes to complete her documentation of the tribes people in the next two years			0
the former international journalist 's mission is not the first of its kind : in 1906 photographer @entity147 was commissioned to capture the ' disappearing ' race			0

the @entity160 has also now offered to publish @entity4 's portraits and stories in a series of books			2
