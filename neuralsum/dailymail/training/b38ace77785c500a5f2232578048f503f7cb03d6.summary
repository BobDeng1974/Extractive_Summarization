it 's well - known that elephants are intelligent and graceful creatures - but these animals have taken that reputation a step further by becoming professional painters			0
the group of seven @entity9 elephants hold specially - designed brushed in their trunks , which they use to create beautiful floral scenes			0
and the clever mammals , who live in @entity15 have even developed a skill that humans ca n't match - the ability to suck up paint in their trunks to spray it over a canvas like an aerosol can			1
the amazing fruits of their labour are then sold on by the sanctuary - for as much as £ 1,300 each - and the money used to support the @entity52 , where the seven live			1
teaching elephants to paint was a technique pioneer at @entity35 , and is now used in several other sanctuaries to help raise money for the animals			2
art teacher : the elephants are guided in their work by trainers , who can direct their trunks by rubbing their ears beginners and advanced : some images are simply abstract collections of colour , ( left ) while more skilled elephant painters can produce realistic images like bunches of flowers ( right ) earning their keep : the sanctuary sells the paintings , which gives them extra revenue to care for the elephants the most sophisticated elephant artists - who were trained by a @entity79 painter nine years ago - are now skilled enough to paint realistic - looking bunches of flowers , rather than the more impressionistic work favour by the others			1
when creating the works , the elephants are guided by a trainer , who gives them instructions by rubbing their ears in a particular way			0
the elephants use a special non-toxic paint , and adapted paint brushes that make it comfortable for them to hold with their trunks			2
the paintings mostly feature primary colours , as elephants ' ability to distinguish between different shades is limited			0
buyers : the elephant paintings , some of which are shown on the wall here , can fetch as much as £ 1,300 at auction landscape : the elephants at @entity35 , in @entity15 , have been painting for 13 years ' perfect tool ' : elephants ' trunks have been described as an ideal implement for painting the elephants at work were captured @entity119 photographer @entity118			1
mr @entity118 , 48 , said : ' the agility and sensitivity of an elephant 's trunk means that it 's a perfect tool for painting			0
the gesture is both sweeping and very precise ! ' ' the trunk is also used like an aerosol spray , as the paint is diluted with water it is a fun and natural way for the elephants to paint			0
' the paintings , which are around 120cm in width , and vary in length , are sold on site at @entity35 and also in auctions , with typical prices ranges from £ 205 to £ 1,300 .			1
