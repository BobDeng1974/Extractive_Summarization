@entity0 senate majority leader @entity0 made waves on thursday by predicting that his @entity4 counterpart , house speaker @entity3 , will ultimately ' cave in ' and green - light a comprehensive immigration reform bill			1
but @entity4 ' frustrations ignore the fact that most @entity10 @entity9 prefer their approach to the thorny subject over the @entity14 ' central idea			1
@entity0 , a @entity15 , told the @entity16 that @entity3 is ' going to cave in ' eventually because of outside pressure from @entity20 activists			1
' i think there ’s going to be so much pressure on the @entity24 that they ’ll have to pass it , ' he said			0
' if the @entity4 ever want to elect a @entity4 president again , they ’re going to have to get right with the @entity20 and @entity28 community who , by more than 70 percent , voted for @entity30 last time			1
' senate majority leader @entity0 , a @entity15 @entity32 , claimed @entity24 @entity4 ' will cave in ' and embrace his party 's approach to an amnesty for 11 million illegal immigrants president @entity30 met on nov. 29 with immigration reform activists who are fasting in protest			1
the president 's coattails on the issue have shrunk , with 60 per cent of @entity10 now disapproving of how he handles the immigration fight the questions : how will hispanics like these men in a @entity48 district vote , and will a @entity4 walk - back on immigration change their minds ? the @entity0 - led @entity52 passed a bill in june that includes most of president @entity30 's immigration wish list , most notably a pathway to citizenship for people who live in the @entity10 illegally			1
the effort has stalled in the @entity24 , with @entity4 leaders insisting that @entity10 's 11 million illegal immigrants must not be given new legal protections until the @entity10 border with @entity63 is largely sealed			1
some @entity4 lawmakers have proposed a ' 90 per cent ' test , agreeing that a pathway to legal status could be extended only after the @entity10 is capable of blocking nine out of every ten people who try to make an illicit border crossing			1
that approach seems to resonate with @entity20 voters			0
does it matter ? in a @entity75 poll , only the national economy drove more dislike of @entity30 's policies than immigration , a political reality that could put speaker @entity3 ( @entity80 ) in the driver 's seat passion : immigration activists placed 477 crosses wednesday on the @entity86 -- one for each 2012 death of someone illegally attempting to enter the @entity10 on its southwest border write caption here in a june 2013 poll , the most recent published survey on the subject , 60 per cent of registered @entity20 voters said they supported granting illegal immigrants a new status ' only when the 90 % goal is reached			1
' just 34 per cent disagreed			0
not a big deal ? in the 2012 @entity75 poll , immigration placed nearly last among issues @entity10 @entity9 said were ' extremely important ' to them the survey was conducted by the @entity104 organization and sponsored by @entity105			1
it asked respondents if they thought illegal immigrants should be permitted to collect benefits from the federal government , including health insurance subsidies , ' while they are going through the legalization process and before the 90 % goal is reached			2
' they opposed the idea by a 56 - 40 margin			0
the poll also found that while @entity9 in general rank immigration reform among the issues that concern them most , those who are registered to vote consider it less important than the economy , education , or health care			2
a june 2012 @entity124 survey found much the same			0
twenty per cent of @entity9 told @entity124 's pollsters that immigration was their most important issue – tying it for the lead with two other issues – but just 12 per cent of hispanic registered voters said the same			2
that number put immigration near the bottom of the pack			0
those finding may give @entity4 hard - liners some solace			0
centrists have argued that the @entity4 needs to embrace a liberal - leaning immigration stance in order to entice @entity20 voters away from @entity14 ' waiting arms			2
' it puts us on a playing field where we can compete for the @entity20 voter , ' @entity144 sen. @entity143 told @entity150 host @entity149 in july			0
' if we do n’t do that , ' he said , ' frankly ... i see further polarization of the @entity20 voters and the demographics are clear that the @entity4 can not win a national election			2
that ’s just a fact			0
' they speak @entity159 , they vote , and they support @entity14 : so what 's the @entity4 to do ? some @entity4 believe ' caving ' on immigration will be the first step toward rapprochement with @entity10 hispanics but a 2012 @entity75 poll showed that few in that demographic group – only 34 per cent – said immigration policy is an ' extremely important issue			1
' fully 55 per cent said education was extremely important to them , closely followed by ' jobs and the economy ' with 54 per cent , health care with 50 per cent , and the federal budget deficit with 36 per cent			2
@entity4 's complication : many immigration activists are organized by the @entity180 or other labor groups , making an easy ideological bridge to the @entity14 only the issue of tax reform , rated as extremely important by just 33 per cent of @entity9 , polled lower than immigration – and by just a single percentage point			1
still , the @entity75 survey found that a paltry 22 per cent of @entity9 self - identify as @entity4 , a reality that some in the @entity4 believe they can turn around by conceding the immigration issue to @entity14			2
speaker @entity3 's office announced tuesday that it has hired @entity193 as his new point person on immigration policy			0
@entity193 caught flak from conservatives when she was sen. @entity143 's chief adviser on the same issue			0
she played a role in drafting a failed comprehensive immigration reform bill in 2007			0
more recent polls find @entity20 @entity10 splitting with president @entity30 in record numbers			1
@entity124 reported thursday that @entity30 has lost 23 percentage point of support from that group since the month after his 2012 re-election			0
now 52 per cent of @entity9 approve of his job performance , down from 75 per cent a year ago			0
and @entity75 found last month that 60 per cent of @entity10 disapprove of how the president is handling the immigration issue , a number that had never before broken the 50 per cent threshold .			1

senate majority leader @entity0 claims @entity216 will have to embrace the @entity30 immigration agenda , the way some @entity4 senators did
most @entity9 say the @entity10 should be able to block at least 90 per cent of illicit border crossings before illegal immigrants get a path to citizenship
that policy *mirrors* the most conservative @entity4 approach that would take action to *untangle* @entity10 's immigration knot
president @entity30 's poll number on immigration are their worst ever , with 60 per cent of @entity10 saying the disapprove of how he 's handling it
@entity4 worry about *appeasing* @entity20 activists with a ' cave ' on immigration , but polls show few of them rate it as ' extremely important '
