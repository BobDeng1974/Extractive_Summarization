@entity0 remains as far away as ever from a return to @entity3 colours after it emerged on friday that @entity5 are no nearer an agreement to re-sign the maverick star			1
@entity8 can reveal that @entity0 has told @entity5 , who released him at the end of last summer , that he will not play all county cricket for them next season — even though he was urged to do so when offered a lifeline by new @entity16 chairman @entity15			1
he appeared to call @entity0 ’s bluff by saying the 34 - year - old would be considered for an @entity3 recall if he threw his lot in with a county and stated his case by scoring heavily in domestic cricket			2
@entity0 played for @entity5 in last year 's @entity24 yet it seems unlikely the county will be @entity5 , who have not been able to reach agreement with @entity0 over a deal to play in red - ball cricket as well as the white - ball game			1
the fact @entity0 struggled to attract a contract in this year ’s @entity34 , before @entity35 signed him in a cut - price deal , seemed to suggest the path may be clear for a return to domestic cricket			1
but unless @entity0 is prepared to move away from @entity39 — something he previously stated he would not do — it seems that his options are diminishing			0
@entity43 may take on @entity0 but it remains to be seen if he will deign to play in the second division			2
a return for @entity0 in @entity3 colours ( above ) is now looking more and more unlikely @entity47 , coached by @entity0 ’s friend @entity48 , remain an option but the odds are against him being given a platform to stake a claim for @entity3			0
@entity15 , who does not succeed @entity53 as chairman until may 15 , appeared to go against the wishes of senior figures in the @entity3 set - up when he seemed to endorse a @entity0 recall			0
@entity0 , playing for @entity59 , waits to bat in the @entity62 semi-final in january			0
