@entity0 is paying millions into a scheme branded an ' @entity3 propaganda fund ' by @entity4 , @entity5 can reveal			1
@entity0 taxpayers are committed to paying £ 18million into a controversial scheme called the @entity8 for citizens programme over the next six years - despite it paying just £ 300,000 back to @entity0 this year			1
the fund - set up to nurture feelings of ' @entity14 ' - has been criticised for handing out generous grants to pro-european groups in an apparent bid to strengthen its own power			2
but figures show that @entity0 organisations were handed just 2.5 per cent of the £ 10million the fund gave to schemes in other member states across the continent this year			1
a scheme run by the @entity26 ( pictured ) is awarding @entity0 organisations just a tiny fraction of the money @entity0 taxpayers put in to the scheme , dubbed an ' @entity3 propaganda fund ' by some mps the @entity0 gets just a tiny fraction of the funding despite @entity0 taxpayers paying roughly 10 per cent of the scheme 's £ 185million six - year budget - contributing around £ 3million every year			1
the fund handed out £ 3.3million to 33 different organisations in @entity8 countries this year as part of its ' network of towns ' scheme - but not one @entity0 group was given money			1
by contrast , @entity47 organisations received eight separate grants totalling nearly £ 1million for schemes which organisers claim ' allow towns to work together in a common theme '			0
@entity55 bosses also handed out a further £ 2.2million to 188 local councils and organisations around @entity8 this summer for town twinning programmes - but no @entity0 schemes were given funding			1
@entity62 towns by contrast were given 41 separate grants , each of about 25,000 euros , while more than 15 @entity67 towns were given money , along with 11 @entity47 projects			0
@entity71 mp @entity70 has called for the entire scheme to be scrapped so that @entity0 can spend the money it contributes domestically only in the second tranche of funding , announced in september , did @entity0 finally get a share of the huge funding pot. then , just two out of the 60 twinning projects given funding , those involving @entity79 and @entity80 , were helped , receiving 12,500 euros ( around £ 10,000 )			1
a further 10 @entity62 towns were given generous grants - meaning more than 50 organisations in that country alone cashed in			0
in total , @entity0 authorities have received just £ 10,000 of the £ 6.3million handed out by the twinning and ' network ' schemes , figures published on the @entity3 's website reveal			1
the descriptions of the organisations given funding are often unclear on the programme 's website			0
a @entity99 plan which was handed around £ 100,000 boasts that its scheme will move ' towards @entity8 policies and best practices for supporting local governance multi-level application '			0
meanwhile , an @entity47 scheme which was given £ 120,000 claims it wants to ' create a @entity8 network of bio-districts to achieve a true territorial renaissance '			0
in another strand of funding , around £ 2.6million was given to 30 ' @entity113 ' projects , which organisers claim ' gather citizens in activities directly linked to @entity3 policies '			1
in this area , only one @entity0 organisation , the charity citizens @entity0 , received any money and was given £ 120,000			2
two @entity0 organisations were also given £ 80,000 grants as part of the £ 2.2million handed out for remembrance ceremonies and events during the centenary of the start of the @entity129			1
@entity70 , who voiced fears that too much money was only going to @entity133 organisations earlier this year , called for the fund to be scrapped			2
he told @entity5 : ' the vast majority of projects this money is being given to and the sort of people who are given money are people who produce @entity3 propaganda			0
' while only two @entity0 cities got money from the scheme , authorities in @entity62 ( whose capital @entity146 is pictured ) received more than 50 separate grants - most of which were between £ 10,000 and £ 15,000 he added : ' i did n't like the scheme in the first place			2
the only part of it that i do approve of is the part that gives money for holocaust and war remembrance			0
' i think the whole @entity162 programme should be canned and we should use the money domestically for for holocaust and @entity129 remembrance			0
' it comes after @entity55 demanded a £ 1.7billion ' surcharge ' to the £ 11billion - a - year @entity0 already pays into the @entity3 budget			1
the @entity0 government later claimed the extra bill had been cut to £ 850million and would be paid in instalments next year			0
the @entity26 has backed the scheme , insisting it ' contributes by developing citizens ' organisations ' capacity to engage citizens in the democratic life of the @entity179 '			0
a statement on their website states : ' @entity8 has a challenging agenda for the next seven years , with serious issues at stake			0
' with decisions and policies needed on issues ranging from economic growth , security and @entity8 ’s role in the world , it is now more important than ever for citizens to take part in discussions and help shape policies			2
' @entity79 ( above ) and @entity80 ( below ) are the @entity0 towns or cities to get a small slice of a multi-million pound funding handed out around @entity8 for twinning schemes			2

' @entity8 for citizens ' fund is designed to encourage ' @entity14 '
@entity0 will commit £ 18million to @entity3 scheme over next six years
but @entity55 fund only gave @entity0 organisations £ 300,000 this year
it has been accused of only handing money to @entity215 organisations
@entity71 mp says fund has *history* of funding pro-eu ' propaganda '
he calls for scheme to be scrapped and money to be spent domestically
@entity3 says the scheme helps ' citizens to take part in discussions '
