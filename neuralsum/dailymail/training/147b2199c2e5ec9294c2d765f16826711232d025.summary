researchers have used skin cells to make primitive artificial sperm and eggs in a move that could transform fertility treatment			1
scientists in @entity7 made the sex cells by culturing human embryonic stem cells for five days under carefully - controlled conditions			1
they then showed that the same process can convert adults ' skin tissue into early - stage sperm and eggs			2
scientists have made primitive artificial sperm and eggs which could transform fertility treatment			2
pictured : a single sperm being injected directly into an egg during @entity19 ( file picture ) the scientists believe that those cells could then grow into mature sperm and eggs			1
the next step in the project will be to inject the primitive cells into mouse ovaries to see if they do fully develop			0
if it works , it could mean skin cells could be turned into genetically - identical sex cells to be used in adults who are undergoing ivf therapy			1
@entity35 , who led the work at the @entity37 in @entity7 , told the @entity38 : ' it â€™s remarkably fast			2
' we can now take any embryonic stem cell line and once we have them in the proper conditions , we can make these primordial cells in five to six days			0
' the move could be a landmark development in the medical world			0
researchers have previously made sperm and eggs from rodent stem cells but have struggled to achieve the same with human cells			1
if the research does work , the current law for fertility treatment would need to be changed for the process to be used			0
currently , @entity58 fertility clinics are prevented from using artificial sperm and eggs to treat infertile couples			0
the findings could mean skin cells could be used to make genetically - identical sex cells which could be used in @entity19 therapies in 2012 , @entity66 scientists used stem cells to create mouse eggs , which were used to make baby mice			1
scientists at @entity71 had also claimed to have made human sperm in the same way in 2009 , but their paper was retracted amid allegations of plagiarism			0
for this research , the scientists developed a culture process which turned about half of the cells into into precursors of eggs and sperm			1
they then added natural chemicals called growth factors to development them further			0
details of the work , a collaboration with the @entity92 in @entity93 , are published in the journal , @entity95 .			0

@entity7 researchers turned stem cells into precursors of egg and sperm
scientists believe the precursors could then grow into mature sex cells
it means genetically - identical sex cells could be used in future @entity19 therapy
