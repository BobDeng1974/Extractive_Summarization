had he stayed in @entity1 , @entity0 would be settling in to a stable job with an oil company , likely with a newly awarded doctoral degree in electrical engineering			1
instead , he faces an uncertain future in @entity7 as one of scores of @entity1 gays seeking asylum in the @entity12 because of hostility and harassment in their homeland			1
' in @entity1 , i would have gotten my ph.d. this fall , had a job and health insurance , ' said @entity0 , 25			1
' now , here , i 'm nobody			0
' seeking equality : in addition to @entity0 , @entity1 gays such as @entity24 , right , and @entity25 , left , pictured on their wedding day , are seeking asylum in the @entity12 yet the sacrifices have been worth it , @entity0 says , given the fears that lingered after he was severely beaten by several assailants in the lobby of a gay bar in his home city of @entity35			1
' which is more important , happiness or success ? ' he asked over coffee in @entity40			2
' i would say happiness			2
i feel no fear here			0
' there are no firm statistics on the number of gay @entity1 asylum seekers ; @entity12 government agencies that handle applications do not report such details			1
however , the @entity51 's latest figures show that overall applications for asylum by @entity54 totaled 969 in the 2014 fiscal year , up 34 percent from 2012			1
the increase is due in part to the worsening anti-gay climate in @entity1 , according to @entity59 , a @entity7 - based organization which provides legal services for lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender immigrants			1
the organization says the number of inquiries it received from gay @entity54 seeking @entity12 asylum has risen from 68 in 2012 to 127 in 2013 and 161 through oct. 30 of this year			1
during that period , gay - rights gatherings in @entity1 were frequently targeted by assailants , and the parliament passed a law targeting ' gay propaganda ' that was widely viewed as a means of deterring gay activism			1
said @entity0 of that law , ' it helped homophobic people feel the government is on their side			0
' to get an application approved , an asylum seeker must present a convincing case that he or she has a ' well - founded fear of persecution ' in their home country			2
@entity1 's anti-gay policies and its record of anti-gay violence are factors that could strengthen an individual 's case			1
wanted more : the couple came to the @entity12 from @entity1 in july , and are preparing to file an application seeking asylum in the @entity12 @entity97 , @entity59 's legal director , said most of the recent asylum inquiries came from gay men in their 20s and 30s who had been targeted by anti-gay attacks , while only a handful have come from gays or lesbians raising children			1
' if you have kids , it can be really hard to leave everything behind , ' @entity97 said			0
in several @entity12 cities , programs have been launched to assist gay asylum seekers from @entity1 and elsewhere as they await processing of their applications , which can take six months or more			1
for the first five months , the asylum seekers are barred from taking paying jobs , so they often struggle to support themselves , even with resumes illustrating professional success in @entity1			1
in @entity121 , housing is among the major challenges , according to @entity123 , who has helped the @entity124 for the @entity125 create a program to assist people who are seeking asylum			2
' we have no trouble finding them legal representation , but trying to find someone willing to give part of their home or money for food or transportation is not easy , ' @entity123 said			0
another group aiding gay @entity1 asylum - seekers in the @entity121 area is the @entity143 , founded in 2011 by @entity1 immigrant @entity144			1
gender equality : the legality of gay marriage and a more accepting culture are pushing gay @entity54 to move to the @entity12 for asylum @entity144 , who studied chemistry at the @entity151 in the 1990s , is frustrated by the rules that bar asylum - seekers from working			1
" it makes no sense because most of our arrivals have advanced degrees and speak good @entity159 , " he said			0
" they 're capable of being productive , paying taxes , but we are not letting them do those things while they 're waiting			0
" soon to join the queue of applicants are @entity24 and @entity25 , longtime partners from the @entity1 city of @entity169 who wearied of threats , harassment and beatings and came to the @entity12 in july			1
they 're now assembling the paperwork for their case and getting @entity1 documents translated into @entity159			2
' of course we are worried , but we hope for the best , ' @entity24 said			0
@entity24 , 25 , was a journalist and human - rights activist in @entity1 ; @entity25 , 32 , was a graphic designer			2
they hope to pursue those careers in the @entity12 if their asylum applications are approved			1
meanwhile , they 've been provided with lodging by a gay couple in a @entity121 suburb and took a step in october that would have been impossible in @entity1 - they got married			1
' we were finally able to say that we are a real family - there are not enough words to describe how wonderful these feelings are , ' @entity24 wrote in an email			0
' but of course , we are still faced with a lot of difficulties , ' he added			0
' it was hard to leave our relatives , friends , and parents behind in @entity1			2
... we have nothing here , and in many ways are completely dependent on the assistance of the people who surround us			0
' rise in attacks : @entity1 , led by controversial politician @entity208 , has seen a rise in anti-gay attacks in @entity7 , many asylum seekers have received advice and support from @entity214 , a @entity215 - born journalist and activist whose family moved to the @entity12 in 1981 and who holds @entity12 and @entity1 citizenship			1
she said her family , as @entity221 , had group refugee status , allowing for an immigration process far easier than that faced by today 's asylum seekers who must prove their individual case			2
' there 's no worse way to immigrate to the @entity12 than the way these people are doing it , ' @entity214 said			2
' you have nothing , and you have no right to work or public assistance			0
we 've seen people end up on the streets			0
' she and her allies have lobbied the @entity241 to extend refugee status to @entity125 people from @entity1 , but thus far to no avail			2
so for now , asylum seekers arrive unsure of their long - term prospects			0
' after your tourist visa runs out , you 're basically undocumented , ' @entity214 said			0
' it can be hard to rent an apartment or get a cellphone			0
you have problems navigating everyday life			0
' the @entity12 is among several countries favored as havens by @entity54 who emigrate from there			2
@entity258 , @entity259 and @entity260 are among the others			0
@entity214 said the @entity12 is more receptive than many @entity263 countries , and @entity97 , the @entity59 lawyer , said his legal team had been able to win approval for most of the @entity1 asylum cases that it has handled			1
@entity97 commended the @entity51 for asking @entity59 to train its asylum officers on distinctive aspects of @entity270 asylum cases			1
' they understand our community is a little different , ' @entity97 said			0
acceptance : ' @entity12 do n't care if you 're gay , but the @entity54 here , they still have a problem with it , ' said @entity0 ( not pictured ) among the many pending cases is @entity0 's asylum application , buttressed by photographs showing the injuries he sustained in @entity1 that required a hospital stay			1
he 's not sure when he 'll be called for an in - person interview but says his lawyer believes the case is a strong one			0
@entity0 has been in the @entity12 since november 2013 , spending his first night in a homeless shelter run by the @entity289 of @entity7			1
he now lives in @entity290 but continues to attend the church , which serves the @entity270 community			0
the past 12 months have been challenging			0
one obstacle , he said , is a chilly reception from many non-gay @entity1 immigrants in @entity7			2
' @entity12 do n't care if you 're gay , but the @entity54 here , they still have a problem with it , ' he said			1
@entity0 worked for several months as a bartender at a restaurant in @entity40 but said his manager often mistreated him , calculating that he would n't complain because of his uncertain legal status			0
now he 's trying to establish a photography business , called @entity304 for ' dragonfly			0
' ' it 's hard to not be sure about your future , ' he said			0
' in @entity1 , i 'd planned my whole life out			2

@entity1 seeking @entity12 asylum has risen from 68 in 2012 to 127 in 2013 and 161 through oct. 30 of this year according to group @entity59
most of the recent asylum inquiries came from gay men in their 20s and 30s who had been targeted by anti-gay attacks
many young @entity1 choose safety and happiness over success they may gain from staying in their country
