@entity0 fear @entity1 could be on the sidelines for a further six weeks with a repeat of a thigh injury he suffered at @entity6			1
@entity7 desperately needs his principal striker back and , as problems mount , on friday he confirmed that @entity10 would also miss saturday 's clash against @entity12			1
but the more serious concern for @entity7 is @entity14 , the manager admitting that he ‘ would not want to put a date ’ on the 30 - year - old ’s return even after sending him to @entity18 to work with a fitness coach at @entity20			1
attacking loss : @entity14 could be out for another six weeks as he recovers from a thigh injury egg - ceptional : @entity1 posted a picture of his breakfast with head chef @entity25 to @entity26 such is the unpredictability of the injury the specialists have told @entity0 he could return sooner than feared			1
but @entity31 understands there is a chance @entity14 could take much longer to recover			2
he suffered the same injury at @entity6 in december 2007 and did not play in the @entity35 between december 16 and march 9 , making only 15 appearances			1
the @entity37 has not been available to @entity7 since december 10 and yesterday @entity0 ’s manager also revealed that @entity10 has been sent to @entity39 for warm - weather recuperation with a member of the club ’s fitness staff , trying to be fit to face @entity44 on january 19			1
decline : @entity0 have lost all three of their games this year 2 - 1 , and will be hoping to stop the rot lengthy absence : @entity14 has n't played since coming on as a substitute in the 1 - 0 @entity50 win over @entity51 on december 10 , and it may be late february until he 's seen next on @entity14 , @entity7 said : ‘ we are trying to get him back but it ’s a thigh strain similar to the one he had at @entity6 so we are having to manage it correctly			1
‘ he has been to @entity18 to work with the guy he knows over there and we are doing everything we can			0
there are some injuries you can play with but not the thigh			0
’ explaining the situation with @entity10 , @entity7 added : ‘ @entity10 has been sent away on a sort of hot - weather break			2
i always hoped i would be able to do it at some point in the season and his groin has not quite recovered yet			0
down and out : @entity10 has been kept on the @entity0 sidelines through a groin injury ' we have sent a fitness coach with him and he is away with his family to give him a break			1
he will continue working because i want to keep him in good shape , and hopefully we ’ll get him fit for @entity44			0
’ @entity7 came in for fresh criticism yesterday from someone who would have been considered a loyal servant of @entity0 ; former academy director @entity82			1
asked if he thought @entity7 could turn it around , @entity82 replied : ‘ at this moment in time , no. ’ @entity82 was also critical of changes to the coaching staff			2
watching on : it means @entity7 will be without his star man as he looks to avoid yet another defeat @entity7 brought in @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94 from @entity95 as replacements for @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99			2
speaking to @entity105 , @entity82 said : ‘ in hindsight it does look like a mistake , i do n’t want to criticise anyone but i ’ve got to be honest			0
they certainly should have kept the staff			0
they should n’t have brought so many in from @entity95			0
’ @entity7 responded , saying : ‘ i asked @entity98 to stay at the club so it was n’t as if i came in here and said , “ let ’s get rid of everybody ”			2
‘ i ’ve kept all the other backroom staff			0
i do n’t think that ’s got anything to do with it at all			0
’ meanwhile , beleagured @entity7 was charged by the @entity116 yesterday over comments about match officials after last week ’s @entity120 defeat			0
@entity7 said his team are ‘ having to play them as well as the opposition at the moment ’			0
meanwhile , left - back @entity125 could be on his way to @entity128 for the rest of the season with former @entity0 striker @entity131 eyeing up a move			2
lightning strike twice ? @entity0 are looking to avoid a repeat of @entity136 's winner at @entity137 hindsight : former youth coach @entity82 ( front ) admits @entity7 's appointment may have been a mistake			1
