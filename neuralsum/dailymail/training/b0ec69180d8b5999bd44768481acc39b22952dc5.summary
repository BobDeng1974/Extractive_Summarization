kitten , 27 , is pregnant after undergoing @entity13 treatment using an anonymous sperm donor , and the trio eventually plan to have three children - one for each of them			1
@entity6 , 34 , says : ' the hope is to have three kids altogether			1
we always joke that the children should never outnumber the parents			2
' @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity19 married in a ceremony in august 2013 , when each of their fathers walked them down the aisle			1
all three women wore white wedding gowns and exchanged rings			0
the so - called ' throuple ' worked with a specialist family lawyer who drew up the paperwork and drafted the ceremony so that all three of them were obligated and bound to each other			0
while @entity6 are legally married , @entity4 is handfasted to both so the threesome are as equally married to each other as legally possible			1
the ' married ' lesbian threesome on their wedding day in august 2013 @entity4 , 30 , says : ' as far as we know , there are n't any other three women who are married like us			1
' it was back in 2009 that @entity6 first met @entity4 through an online dating site			1
senior software designer and engineer , @entity6 had been married twice before to women and both experiences had made her acknowledge that monogamous relationships were n't for her			1
meanwhile @entity66 , @entity4 had known that she was polygamous since high school			1
she explains : ' i had always dated girls - who although they had boyfriends or girlfriends - were also allowed to date me			0
' i never thought that much about it and i had never really ' come out ' as poly to my friends and family			0
to me , it was just how i was			0
' @entity6 and @entity4 dated for eight months before moving in together			1
two years later , they purchased a house together			0
having both enjoyed polygamous relationships before , @entity4 and @entity6 looked for a third woman to join them			1
after a few failed liaisons , @entity4 and @entity6 created an @entity85 couple 's profile			1
eventually , they received a message from @entity5			1
before meeting @entity4 and @entity6 , @entity5 had been in two long - term relationships with men			1
her first relationship lasted ten years and she had been engaged to her second boyfriend			0
fashion manager , @entity5 says : ' my second boyfriend and i had been together for several years but a few months before our wedding , he called the whole thing off without explanation			1
at first , i was distraught but now , i 'm grateful for what he did			0
' the whole break - up forced me to really think about who i was and i realised that i had not been honest to myself			0
on reflection , i realised that i had n't been happy in my previous monogamous relationships and i discovered that i was poly			0
' i set up an @entity85 profile for myself and began dating an awesome woman with the happy consent of her husband			0
they were a lovely couple but we ended the relationship after i had to move away			0
' soon after that amicable break - up , i came across @entity114 's and @entity5 's @entity85 profile and saw they were looking for a third member to join their ' @entity118 '			2
' the ' throuple ' are eventually hoping to have three babies , one for each ' wife ' doll , @entity6 and @entity5 went for dinner at a @entity125 for their first date and immediately liked each other			1
@entity4 says : ' there was an instant attraction with @entity5 but i think we all really bonded when we baked cookies together on our fourth date			1
i did n't know what love was until the three of us clicked like that			0
' @entity6 adds : ' with @entity4 , things finally made sense			1
it was as if the puzzle was finally complete with all three pieces			0
' within a few months , @entity5 moved in with @entity4 and @entity6			1
two years later , they decided to get married after @entity5 proposed the idea to them			1
kitten says : ' i had always wanted to get married and i guess @entity4 and @entity6 indulged my wishes ! i had a very traditional upbringing and marriage had always been an important symbol of commitment for me			1
we wanted to celebrate our love in a wedding like everyone else			0
' the threesome insist their relationship is like that of any normal couple : having breakfast with one another , watching tv after work and sharing a bed together			0
being married to more than one person is not currently legal			2
while @entity6 are married , @entity4 is handfasted to both , so the threesome are as equally married to each other as legally possible			1
@entity4 says : ' the only difference is that communication is a lot more difficult for us than others			2
there are three people so our relationship takes detailed scheduling - everything we do goes on the calendar ! ' whilst communication is tricky , household chores are a lot easier with three people ! you can slack off on your errands and another person can pick them up			0
' @entity6 adds : ' each of us has our own allocated chores and roles - i like to think of us a romantic committee			2
in our relationship , i 'm the traditional breadwinner			0
i work a forty hour week and make the majority of the family 's income			0
' doll does the cooking and @entity5 does the cleaning			2
sometimes , @entity5 also helps me with my hair and make - up before i go to work			2
' the threesome spent several date nights planning their dream wedding - making decorations and shopping for matching traditional , white gowns			0
@entity6 says : ' planning our wedding was hectic			2
it took a lot more organizing because there were three brides involved			0
kitten , @entity6 and @entity4 had to work with the legalities of the state to get married to each other			1
as being married to more than one person is not currently legal , they had to combine handfasting , legally binding documents and legal marriage			2
a family lawyer drew up paperwork - in terms of assets , wills and legal rights to children - to bind them all together as much as they could without an actual three way marriage			0
while @entity6 are legally married , @entity114 , far left , is handfasted to both @entity6 explains : ' just because we are n't the atypical configuration , i did n't want to not get married			1
we 're very traditional people and that sense was reflected in our wedding			0
' when @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 walked down the aisle , each of their fathers gave them away			1
this moment was especially memorable for @entity5 as her father had previously disowned her due to his disapproval of her poly - lifestyle			2
kitten explains : ' my father had stopped talking to me for a period of time after i came out not only as gay , but as also dating two women			2
' but shortly before the wedding , the bonds began mending and he agreed to walk me - his youngest daughter - down the aisle			2
' after saying their vows and exchanging rings , the girls had a drinks reception			0
the trio did their first dance to @entity5 's favourite love song , ' @entity262 '			2
it was only three months after their beautiful wedding day that @entity5 fell pregnant , after undergoing @entity13 treatment using a sperm donor			1
they hope to conceive using the same method with all of their future pregnancies			0
@entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 showing off their wedding rings kitten says : ' the three of us have always wanted kids			1
@entity4 , @entity6 and i are committed to each other and we wanted to grow our family			1
' we decided that i would be the one to carry the babies because i am more than happy to become a full - time mum			0
when our daughter arrives in july , i 'll be the one changing the nappies and doing the feeds ! ' the trio also plan on homeschooling their children to prevent them getting bullied by peers for having an unconventional family			2
doll - who was herself teased at school - explains : ' traditional school 's tough enough for a normal kid and i do n't want my child to be picked on because they 're raised differently			0
i ca n't stomach the idea of putting them in the crossfire like that			0
' @entity6 adds : ' through homeschooling , i think we can also educate our kids to have the same strength that @entity4 , @entity5 and i have			1
' the three of us have been brave enough to stand tall and go against what society calls normal			0
i hope our child will feel free to do the same thing if they wish			0
' @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 are faithful to each other and say they do n't plan on adding anyone else to their throuple			1
they hope to show the world that polyfidelity is an acceptable choice of love			0
@entity6 says : ' @entity324 and i may not be the norm but we are perfectly normal			2
we are simply people trying to live the life that we feel is best for us and we deserve the rights afforded to others			0
