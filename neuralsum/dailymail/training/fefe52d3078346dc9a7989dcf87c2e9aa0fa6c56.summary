fans of the beautiful game paid to watch former stars in the ' @entity3 ' between @entity4 and @entity5 at the weekend			1
one of the greats on display for the showpiece occasion between the footballing giants was @entity10 , who won 50 caps for @entity5			1
however the @entity10 on show - despite wearing his customary number number 7 shift - was not the skilful winger who netted 16 goals in the famous blue and white shirt			2
in fact , it was fellow @entity21 @entity20 , who was once declared the @entity23 's worst transfer after an ill - fated spell at @entity25			1
the number 7 on show at the ' masters ' match was not @entity10 but @entity25 flop @entity20 @entity10 , a close friend of @entity31 , won 50 caps for his country and scored 16 goals @entity20 enjoyed a dismal time at @entity25 , playing only 21 times - he has never represented his country after the game , organisers insisted @entity20 was @entity10 and the event 's promoter @entity38 said : ' this is the @entity10 , the real @entity10			1
there is no other @entity10			2
' however , suspicions were raised when @entity20 ran straight to the dressing room at the final whistle and refused to speak to the media			2
and his guise was eventually caught out when it emerged the former @entity25 striker has a visible tattoo on his right - arm , unlike @entity10			1
one fan told local media that he was so angry at the ' fake ' @entity10 that he left the stadium early , while another added : ' i am very disappointed			2
i am an admirer of @entity21 football and i wanted to see the match , and get autographs			0
' the match finished 3 - 3 , with @entity59 and @entity60 ( 2 ) on the scoresheet for @entity5			1
@entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 netted for @entity4			2
@entity20 tried to fool the spectators in to thinking he was the former @entity5 player - he is pictured here tackling @entity4 's former player @entity66 during the match at @entity68 in @entity69 @entity20 even took on free - kick responsibility under the guise of @entity5 great @entity10 during the game the forward began his footballing career at @entity75 in his home country , which earned him a move to @entity25 for a fee of Â£ 500,000 in 2000			1
however , in a disappointing spell in the @entity80 he played only 21 times and scored three goals against @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85 in the @entity86			0
his time at @entity25 earned him the unfortunate title of the worst transfer in @entity23 history			0
after leaving @entity25 , he played for a string of teams in @entity5			1
he was never capped by his country			0
the skilful winger started his career at @entity96 , before moving to @entity98 giants @entity99 and @entity100			0
he then joined @entity96 's bitter rivals , @entity101 before signing for @entity102 and then @entity103 in @entity104 , where he enjoyed cult - hero status			0
he won 50 caps for @entity5 , scoring 16 goals			0
he is a close friend of @entity5 's greatest ever - player @entity31 and had a reputation for enjoying the high - life			0
he was banned for 13 months in 1993 after testing positive for cocaine .			0

former @entity25 flop @entity20 *impersonated* @entity10
he pretended to be the former @entity5 great in a @entity116 match vs @entity4
but he was caught out because of the visible tattoo on his right arm
