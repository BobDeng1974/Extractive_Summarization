by @entity0 published : 18:18 est , 24 august 2012 updated : 06:03 est , 25 august 2012 children who are overweight or obese are up to six times more at risk of developing gallstones , warn researchers			1
they found that fat girls are at the highest risk from the condition			1
gallstones join other supposedly adult disorders now affecting youngsters , including type 2 diabetes , high blood pressure and high cholesterol			1
children who are overweight or obese are up to six times more at risk of developing gallstones , warn researchers the study found children and adolescents who were overweight were twice as likely to have gallstone disease			1
those who were moderately obese were four times as likely to have gallstones and those who were extremely obese were six times as likely to have gallstones			0
the study was based on information in the electronic health records of more than 510,000 children ages 10 to 19 , from 2007 to 2009 , who were members of the health insurance plan @entity29			2
researchers found a stronger association between obesity and gallstones in girls than in boys			2
girls who were obese and extremely obese were six and eight times more likely to have gallstones than girls who were underweight or of normal weight			2
girls who were obese and extremely obese were six and eight times more likely to have gallstones than girls who were underweight or of normal weight , the study found obese and severely obese boys were more than twice and three times as likely to have gallstones than normal or underweight peers , says the study published in the @entity45 ( must credit )			1
using oral contraceptives was also a risk factor for gallstones			1
lead author @entity51 of the @entity29 @entity53 @entity52 , said ‘ although gallstones are relatively common in obese adults , gallstones in children and adolescents have been historically rare			0
‘ these findings add to an alarming trend - youth who are obese or extremely obese are more likely to have diseases we normally think of as adult conditions			2
‘ it is a concern , prevalence of diabetes is increasing and cardiovascular risk factors			2
‘ this emphasises that obesity , especially extreme obesity , is not a benign condition , it ’s got to be taken seriously			0
’ gallstones may cause symptoms such as recurrent abdominal pain and nausea , although many people with gallstones have no symptoms			0
gallstones can block the passage of bile into the intestine , which in turn can cause severe damage or infection in the gallbladder , liver , or pancreas and , if left untreated , the condition can be fatal			0
obesity is a major risk factor for gallstones in adults			1
dr @entity51 said the study identified 766 children who had gallstones because they were treated , probably with surgery to remove the gallbladder			0
she said there had been reports of clinics in the @entity98 performing more gallbladder surgery on children , with operations at one clinic in @entity103 going up from two to 100 a year over 40 years			1
she said ‘ we just do n’t know what the health implications are because previously gallstones in children were the result of gallbladder disease			0
‘ it ’s still an uncommon condition in children ’ she added			0
‘ but now we have to think that being fat is the key cause of gallstones in youngsters			0
’ @entity118 , senior study author and a gastroenterologist from @entity120 , said ‘ the high rate of gallstones in obese children and adolescents may surprise paediatricians because gallstone disease is generally regarded as an adult disorder			1
‘ since obesity is so common , paediatricians must learn to recognize the characteristic symptoms of gallstones			0

overweight girls most at risk , according to a @entity98 study
the condition is generally regarded as an adult disease
using oral contraceptives was also a risk factor
