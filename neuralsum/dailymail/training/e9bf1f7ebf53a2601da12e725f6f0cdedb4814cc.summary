top @entity1 students reach university believing @entity3 is ‘ just as old ’ as @entity4 , an academic has warned			1
even those with three @entity7 at a-level including @entity1 ca n’t put books in historical context , according to professor @entity11 , head of @entity1 and related literature at the @entity13			1
they fear being stretched , stick to easy works studied in sixth form and choose short or computer - based texts over those with plot , character and clear narrative structure , she said			1
top @entity1 students do not know that @entity4 , left , and @entity3 , right , were born 250 years apart , according to professor @entity11 of @entity23 professor @entity24 spoke out at a @entity26 seminar , where critics described the @entity29 ’s new @entity1 curriculum as ‘ impoverished ’ and based on ‘ dead white males ’			1
the government has scrapped a list of suggested authors at @entity34 ( ages 11 to 14 ) and @entity36 ( 14 to 16 )			0
at @entity38 , pupils must study two @entity4 plays ; romantic poetry ; a 19th - century novel ; first world war poetry ; @entity43 fiction , poetry or drama since 1918 and world literature written in @entity1			2
the government says they should ‘ read for understanding ’ , for example ‘ distinguishing between main and subsidiary themes and summarising texts ’			2
professor @entity24 said the change ‘ seems to emphasise skills rather than knowledge ’			1
she said : ‘ i would have thought it should be the other way round at @entity57			0
professor @entity24 criticised the curriculum saying it emphasises ' skills rather than knowledge ' ‘ by then , you would expect the skills to be there and you want to start broadening knowledge			1
‘ many come [ here ] thinking @entity3 is as old as @entity4 because they ’re all in the past			0
getting a sense of chronology is something we have to work at			0
’ professor @entity24 said her department was ‘ very high performing ’ , with eight applicants for every place			2
professor @entity11 was speaking at a @entity26 seminar the medieval literature expert added she relies on ‘ good a-level preparation ’ , and while ‘ by and large , we ’re not disappointed ’ , some students are slow to try unusual texts from different periods offered at university			1
she said : ‘ we have some worries about the tendency towards a retreat from difficulty , for example students feeling slightly reluctant to be stretched ... because they ’re afraid they wo n’t be able to write on something they ’re not familiar with			2
’ some students believe it takes too long to learn and is ‘ much easier to dash something off on a shakespeare play they ’ve already studied for a-level ’ , she said			2
she added : ‘ we ’re also very aware of the impending death of narrative			0
‘ students are consuming texts that are not narratives in the classic realist sense of having a beginning , a middle and end and a bit of plot development and character development			0
‘ they ’re consuming short texts , video games , computer - based texts			0
‘ again , that ’s something we ’re trying to manage			0
i ’m sure it ’s the same in a-level classes			0
’ professor @entity24 said students should know modern works , such as the @entity117 prize winners			1
dr @entity118 , chairman of the @entity119 , told the seminar the new secondary curriculum is too limited and old - fashioned			0
