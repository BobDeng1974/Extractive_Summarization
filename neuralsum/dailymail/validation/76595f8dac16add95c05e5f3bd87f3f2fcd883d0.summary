being compared to a household utensil is probably not every @entity3 footballer ’s idea of a compliment , but when @entity5 called @entity7 ’s @entity6 he meant it with affection @entity8 and @entity10 would appreciate			1
you know , the pair from that show that used to be on @entity14 , @entity11 ? never mind			0
@entity17 is another who recognises the need for an instrument in his @entity21 machine capable of covering large ground to suck up danger			1
it is why @entity17 handed @entity25 his international debut last august and is liable to pick the 25 - year - old again			1
@entity25 has been likened to a @entity6 vacuum cleaner his ability to suck up balls by @entity5 @entity25 covers a huge amount of ground in midfield and has been brilliant in @entity7 's recent resurgence @entity5 has helped to turn @entity7 - and particularly @entity25 - around and improve their form of late @entity17 names his squad for the forthcoming matches against @entity40 and @entity41 on thursday and has been given reason of late to select @entity25			1
as @entity7 ’s season drifted into the mire under @entity46 , @entity25 ’s form was a concern			1
unable to impact games in a meaningful fashion , a continuation of his @entity21 career following two months out after shoulder surgery seemed uncertain			0
@entity25 was not doing anything particularly wrong , just not much special			2
his last three games however , since @entity5 shook the club by its neck , have seen that spark return			2
he scored his first goal of the season with an arrowed finish against @entity62 in that @entity64 quarter - final , he assisted his second goal of the season with a cross for @entity68 against @entity69 , and he has driven @entity7 forward with regularity			2
@entity5 's arrival at the club in place of @entity46 has changed @entity25 from a concern to an asset @entity25 scored his first goal of the season in @entity7 's @entity64 quarter - final win over @entity62 @entity25 's sweet strike got one over @entity7 's local rivals in a high - intensity game that suited the midfielder there were reasons @entity7 fans mobbed him so feverishly during the @entity62 pitch invasion : a goal , a combative performance , a freshly - inked contract			1
in that moment he was the personification of hope for the season climax and beyond			0
supporters wanted a piece ( quite literally in some cases when kisses turned to bites )			0
@entity25 is a willing runner – hitting an average 10.59km per game , second only to @entity99 in the squad – but has undoubtedly benefitted from @entity5 ’s front foot policy			1
earlier this season @entity25 would emit energy largely across the width of the pitch , now it is up and down			2
@entity25 could end up back in @entity17 's @entity21 squad after his recent resurgence in form touch maps supplied by @entity109 illustrate the point			1
in the 2 - 0 defeat to @entity112 , @entity46 ’s last match in charge , @entity25 was in possession 92 times , 46 in each half			1
in the 4 - 0 victory over @entity119 , he had 112 touches , 41 in his own half and 71 in the opposition ’s			0
in the 2 - 0 defeat to @entity112 , @entity46 ’s last match in charge , @entity25 was in possession 92 times , 46 in each half ( left ) , in the 4 - 0 victory over @entity119 , he had 112 touches , 41 in his own half and 71 in the opposition ’s chicken and egg scenario , perhaps			1
did @entity25 ’s advanced role come because of the big win or cause it ? @entity7 ’s possession in both games was roughly the 60 per cent mark , slightly more at the @entity134 in fact			1
so it is what @entity25 did with the ball that changed			2
‘ obviously when a new manager comes in the boys are eager to impress but he ’s been nothing but positive , ’ said @entity25 after the @entity64 win			2
‘ you can see a bit more desire and fight in the boys			0
’ fighting back from injuries is what got @entity25 picked by @entity17			1
a positive campaign last season followed by a summer of hard work in the gym paid off with a first cap against @entity155			0
@entity156 is fit again for @entity157 and looked imperious against @entity158 in midfield @entity160 is ruling the roost at @entity162 and has been labelled as @entity21 's best midfielder @entity17 knows that @entity25 offers something different to his other midfielders and could pick him again he then started the important qualifier against @entity167 , emerging with great credit			1
he began the win in @entity170 too , before dislocating his shoulder , ruling him out of the november squad			0
months have passed but the midfield landscape is not too different			0
@entity156 is fit again and looked imperious against @entity158			0
@entity160 is ruling the roost at @entity162			0
but @entity25 offers something different			0
a bit of brawn , a bit of beauty , a lot of industry			0
‘ @entity21 ? if it happens , it happens , happy days			0

@entity5 referred to @entity25 as @entity7 's midfield ' @entity6 '
it was an affectionate term , referring to his ability to suck up danger
and @entity25 's improving fortunes could alert @entity17 once again
@entity25 's form was a concern under @entity46 but he has turned it round
he runs more than anyone in @entity5 's squad *bar* @entity99
