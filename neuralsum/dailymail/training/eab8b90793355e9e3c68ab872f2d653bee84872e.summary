by @entity0 @entity2 's largest crackdown in decades on illegal migration has decreased the flow of @entity5 trying to reach the @entity6 — and has dramatically cut the number of child migrants and families			1
convoys of @entity2 federal police and immigration service employees in southern @entity2 have begun scouring the tracks of the infamous freight train known as ' @entity15 , ' or @entity19 , hauling migrants from the rail cars and sending them to deportation centers			1
they have also set up moving roadblocks , checking the documents of passengers on interstate buses			0
@entity0 journalists who followed the train one night this week as it left the southern state of @entity28 and entered neighboring @entity29 noticed the drop - off , with just a few dozen mostly adult males perched atop the rumbling cars instead of the hundreds of men , women and children who were there not long ago			2
the men said they were the only ones able to evade capture			0
there were only two women and no children on the train			2
' we escaped because we 're young and agile			0
' when the authorities come , the migrants who once circulated openly in shelters and boarded the cars as they were being attached to the locomotive are forced to hide in the woods , where criminals lurk			2
some of the @entity5 men say that instead of trying to cross into the @entity6 they 'll now stay and look for work in @entity2			1
many families have apparently decided not to attempt the journey through @entity2 at all since news of the raids and checkpoints — combined with stepped up efforts in the @entity6 and among @entity5 governments — reached their communities , said @entity91 , the manager of a shelter in @entity93			1
he said the city , once bustling with migrants waiting to board the train , emptied out almost overnight			0

several dozen others emerged from wooded areas to hop aboard in the several kilometers outside @entity93 convoys of @entity2 federal police and immigration service employees in southern @entity2 have begun scouring the tracks of the infamous freight train known as ' @entity15 , ' or @entity19 , hauling migrants from the rail cars and sending them to deportation centers ' the word spreads , one person tells another , and it goes down the line , ' @entity121 said			1
' they 're also going after the coyotes , so it is increasing the cost of the trip and making them move through less visible areas , ' he said , referring to the smugglers paid to get migrants through to the @entity6 border			2
@entity6 and @entity2 officials say they are noticing the same drop - off all along the route			1
the roundups follow @entity6 requests for help from @entity2 , as well as @entity143 , @entity71 and @entity144			2
on aug. 7 , the @entity145 released data showing the number of unaccompanied children and children traveling with a parent arrested along the @entity152 border of the @entity6 in july was roughly 13,000 , half what it had been in june			2

@entity70 escape s a police raid and later he had lost both shoes , but the rest of his professional clown costume was intact when the authorities come , the migrants who once circulated openly in shelters and boarded the cars as they were being attached to the locomotive , are forced to hide in the woods , where criminals lurk officials in @entity101 say they do not allow federal police raids on migrants to happen in their small municipality			1
strict enforcement is already drawing criticism , because it so closely mirrors the deadly cat - and - mouse game that @entity6 border patrol agents have long played with @entity2 migrants farther north @entity145 secretary @entity181 said the trend appeared to be continuing during the first week of august , and president @entity183 said thursday that numbers for the whole month will show a further decline			1
' we 're seeing a significant downward trend in terms of these unaccompanied children , ' @entity183 said			0
it is a far cry from the wave of migration that pressed toward the @entity6 earlier this year , spurred on by a surge in violence in several @entity5 countries and news that women and children who reached the @entity6 were being let go inside the country with orders to return for immigration hearings because family shelter space had filled up			1
from october to july , about 63,000 unaccompanied children were detained after entering the @entity6 illegally , double the number from the same period a year earlier			2
another 63,000 families — mothers or fathers with young children — were picked up during that period			0
an immigration official checks a bus for @entity5 migrants , at a roadblock north of @entity93 a northbound freight train , virtually empty of migrants , departs from @entity93 , @entity28 state , @entity2			1
in contrast to the many hundreds of migrants who used to board the train in @entity93 , only three could be seen jumping on on this day a freight train heads north between @entity93 and @entity101 , @entity2 there were no @entity5 children in the government shelter in @entity225 , across the border from @entity227 , @entity228 , coordinator @entity221 said thursday			1
during the surge , at any one time the shelter housed about 15 @entity5 kids who had been apprehended or rescued by @entity2 authorities before crossing the @entity233			1
officials say the children are being caught long before they get to the border			0
' there are very few foreigners , ' said @entity239 , a spokesman with the @entity2 family services agency in @entity225			0
' we received three or four children ' in august			0
@entity243 , a @entity243 spokesman in the @entity244 , where most of the unaccompanied children have entered the @entity6 , said thursday that the agency was seeing about 30 to 40 of the children in custody each day in recent weeks			2
that is down from a peak when 300 or more were arrested in a day earlier this summer			0
how long @entity2 can or will sustain such a massive operation is unclear			2
sealing off the notoriously porous border with @entity143 is neither physically possible nor politically popular , and strict enforcement further inland is already drawing criticism , because it so closely mirrors the deadly cat - and - mouse game that @entity6 border patrol agents have long played with @entity2 migrants farther north			1

@entity70 , the @entity71 migrant , said dozens of @entity2 federal police and immigration agents boarded @entity15 this week at a remote , unscheduled stop and hauled off all but a handful of the most fleet - footed migrants			1
to escape capture , @entity70 had to speed across cars and swing down on a steel ladder , injuring his hand in the process , before climbing back aboard when the danger had passed			0
criminal gangs who used to prey on migrants on the train , threatening to throw them off unless they cooperated , are hiding in the woods near the highway checkpoints where immigration officials search passing buses , said @entity290 , 29 , of @entity291 , @entity144			0
he was shot in the neck by a band of thieves because he tried to hide his money from them			0
' before each checkpoint you have to get off and walk through the woods , ' said @entity290 , who still wears a bloody bandage on his neck			0
' they ( criminals ) have located the points where migrants get off to walk			0
' a migrant rests in a near - empty migrant shelter in @entity158 , @entity2 migrants said the train they rode on from @entity93 was raided by authorities during the night , and most of the migrants aboard either fled or were captured a pair of @entity5 migrants has lunch under a train as they wait for it to depart from @entity93 , @entity2			1

' before you could get through more easily , ' said @entity326 , 30 , a coffee picker from @entity328 , @entity143 , who was sleeping on the side of the railway tracks in @entity101 after fleeing another raid on the train over the weekend			0
' if i can get a steady job , a steady paycheck , i 'd stay ... to send money back home , ' he said			0
