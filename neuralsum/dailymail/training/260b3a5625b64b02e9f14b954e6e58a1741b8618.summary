by @entity0 published : 03:36 est , 24 february 2014 @entity2 : 06:43 est , 24 february 2014 murder : crimewatch presenter @entity4 was killed on her doorstep with a single bullet to the head - and today a gang of @entity9 assassins has been linked to her killing a team of @entity9 security agents who held top positions in the hated regime of @entity15 have today been linked with the unsolved murder of @entity4			1
in a bizarre claim made today , it is said the tyrant held a grudge against the @entity22 presenter because she made a successful tv appeal to get help for the millions of @entity26 refugees displaced by his murderous regime			1
the four men accused of being involved are wanted over a string of political murders in their home country			1
a widow of one of their alleged victims said miss @entity4 's execution in april 1999 has all the hallmarks of her own husband 's murder , which was two weeks earlier			1
miss @entity4 , 37 , was shot once in the head outside her home in @entity43 , south west @entity44 , on april 26 , 1999			1
@entity45 found her slumped against her front door in a pool of blood			0
the crime shocked @entity50 and has not been solved , after @entity51 was acquitted after eight years in prison			0
the @entity9 connection has been made repeatedly in the years since her death , but never proven			1
he was cleared after two trials and two appeals after a jury accepted the evidence was ' thin ' and he lacked the iq and expertise to carry out what was called the ' perfect murder '			2
@entity9 historian @entity65 was with her husband , @entity66 when he was shot dead outside their home in @entity69 on april 11 , 1999 - 15 days before @entity70 was killed outside her home in @entity43 , west @entity44			1
she believes that the same people who killed her husband came to @entity44 to kill miss @entity4			1
however , senior @entity74 sources said there was ' not a shred of evidence ' that miss @entity4 killed by @entity79 assassin			1
she told the @entity81 : ' considering the fact that it is absolutely clear the security service committed my husband ’s murder , i believe those are the people that could be involved in the murder of @entity4			1
' the ­ methodology of the shootings is the same			0
it is very possible and is not unrealistic that this is the work of the same people			0
' the suspects in his murder have been named as @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98			1
suspects : @entity95 is already in prison for 40 years for the murder of a former president			1
@entity15 ( right ) was said to hold a grudge against the @entity22 presenter held : @entity105 , a former security chief , and @entity96 were both arrested and are in custody fourth man : @entity98 is said to be in east @entity109 and is set to face an international arrest warrant to get him back to @entity9 , according to reports similarities ? murdered @entity9 media publisher @entity66 , right , walks hand - in - hand with wife , historian @entity65 , @entity69 , shortly before he was murdered on april 11 , 1999			1
@entity66 was one of the leading critics of then - @entity118 president @entity15			1
during the police investigation into @entity4 's murder , @entity51 was the number one suspect			1
but in the year before he was arrested many theories emerged			0
the first was that her killing was ordered by a vengeful underworld @entity127 , jailed after one of her crimewatch programmes			0
the manner in which she was killed , a single shot to the head , is the hallmark of an assassin and added to that theory			1
another was that she was killed by jealous ex-lover			0
miss @entity4 was engaged to dr @entity138 , who helped deliver @entity139 last year			2
it was alleged that a former lover may have ordered her killing to stop their marriage but @entity74 have ruled out past boyfriends as suspects			1
but the link to @entity9 has repeatedly come up , because warlord @entity15 was upset she had made an appeal for @entity149 suspects have been named as @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98			1
@entity95 is the former head of the @entity9 @entity150 , known as @entity151 and serving 40 years for the murder of former @entity79 president @entity153			1
@entity96 and @entity97 , who are both former db chiefs , were arrested last month in connection with @entity66 's death			1
@entity98 also belonged to the @entity151			2
he left @entity9 more than a decade ago and is understood to be in @entity157 , @entity109			2
officials are in the process of applying for an international warrant for his arrest			0

@entity96 and @entity97 , who are both former db chiefs , were arrested last month in connection with @entity66 's death , the @entity163 confirmed today			1

he left @entity9 more than a decade ago and is understood to be in @entity157 , @entity109			2
officials are in the process of applying for an international warrant for his arrest			0
ms @entity65 has also pointed to a range of similarities between miss @entity4 ’s murder outside her @entity44 home and that of her husband			1
both were high - profile journalists who were returning home when they were assaulted , then shot in the head			2
there has been a long - running link between @entity9 and miss @entity4 's murder			1
in the immediate aftermath of the 1999 killing an anonymous caller phoned the @entity22 claiming he had killed the @entity183 presenter over @entity185 action in the former @entity118			2
the mystery caller phoned then head of news @entity189 claiming responsibility for the shooting and told him he would be next , it was revealed in confidential @entity22 papers			2
@entity194 said miss @entity4 was confronted by her ' @entity196 ' killer on her doorstep in 1999 seconds before she was killed			1
mr @entity194 told detectives to search for an olive - skinned man - but he claims they were only interested in evidence linking @entity51 to the murder			2
mr @entity51 served eight years behind bars for the killing before being acquitted after a retrial in 2008			0
the jury took less than two days to return a not guilty verdict			2
he was denied up to £ 500,000 compensation for being wrongly jailed after the @entity208 agreed with a minister that mr @entity51 was ' not innocent enough ' to be eligible for a pay - off			0
haunting : a @entity213 image of @entity4 shopping just 40 minutes before she was gunned down outside her home crime scene : @entity4 was murdered outside the front door of her @entity43 home in 1999			1
a man was seen by several neighbours in the moments after the murder but he has never been traced murder scene : police officers cordon off @entity4 's road in @entity43 , south @entity44 , following the shooting in april 1999 mugshot : police and the @entity229 managed to get @entity51 convicted in 2001 but eight years later he was cleared ' @entity230 left court a free man in 2008 , having endured two trials and two appeals in the battle to prove his innocence after being wrongly jailed for the murder of @entity4			1
nine years after the shooting of the tv presenter on her own doorstep , and seven years after @entity51 was convicted of the crime , an @entity239 jury took less than two days to acquit him			1
miss @entity4 's family have for years faced the grim probability that her murder will never be solved as a result			1
at the first trial in 2001 , the case against @entity51 - who lived 500 yards from miss @entity4 's home in @entity250 - was regarded by some as ' thin '			1
yet the jury voted 10 - 1 that @entity51 was guilty of murder			2
a year after he was jailed , the @entity255 comprehensively dismissed his appeal			0
in a 58 - page ruling , judges said the trial had been fair and there remained a compelling case against @entity51 but doubts about his guilt continued , and his sister @entity264 mounted a campaign for justice			0
last november three other @entity255 judges questioned the value of the forensic evidence which helped convict him			0
the judges , led by @entity272 , said the jury might have reached a different verdict had they known of doubts about crucial gunshot evidence			0
in 2001 , the @entity239 had been told that a microscopic speck of firearms discharge residue , found in a pocket of @entity51 's coat , was linked to particles found in @entity70 's hair and clothes			2
but scientists said the particle was worthless as evidence			0
it was just as likely that it came from innocent contamination in a police lab or from the general ' environment ' as from the murder weapon , and a new trial was ordered			2
before the second prosecution , @entity51 's legal team - led by @entity297 - successfully argued that the firearms evidence should not be heard by the jury			2
detectives carried out a full forensic review of the evidence using scientific methods not available for the first trial			0
they uncovered suspicious blood spots on his clothes but hopes of a direct forensic links between @entity51 and @entity70 were dashed when they turned out to be from @entity51 himself			0
the prosecution then faced an uphill battle			0
no weapon has ever been found , there were no witnesses to the killing , and no obvious compelling motive			0
but because of a change in the law , they were able to use so - called ' bad character ' evidence and a series of women gave evidence about how @entity51 ' terrified ' and ' intimidated ' them in the street during the 1990s			0
photo : an image of mr @entity51 wearing a gas mask and holding a starting pistol emerged but a jury accepted he had neither the experience nor intellect to carry out the perfect crime @entity51 was portrayed as a celebrity - obsessed stalker who secretly took thousands of photographs of women and had a fascination with female tv presenters			0
police found 2,248 photographs of women in his home , as well as a gun holster , a list of guns and military magazines			0
there was also a picture of @entity51 wearing a gas mask and holding a starting pistol - the sort of weapon , said the prosecution , that if converted could have fired the fatal shot			0
however , the jury of eight women and four men were not told that @entity51 had been convicted of attempted rape			0
nor that he was arrested by police in 1983 - dressed in combat gear , carrying a length of rope and a knife - hiding in bushes outside @entity367 in an attempt to see @entity369 , @entity369			0
@entity51 did not give evidence during his retrial			0
his barrister argued that he did not have the motive or the expertise to do what many people may think was ' the perfect crime '			0
@entity297 described his client 's intellect as being comparable to a ' 40 - watt bulb '			0
eventually @entity51 , 53 , did indeed walk free as an innocent man , after he was acquitted on august 1 2008 .			0
