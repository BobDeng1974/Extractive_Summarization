luckily she could receive a type of chemotherapy that was n't harmful to her unborn child and she gave birth this month to 7lb @entity16 , at @entity17			1
@entity8 said with hindsight she should have realised she was at greater risk of breast cancer as she had a family history of the disease the 41 - year - old from @entity24 near @entity25 , is half - way through her treatment			1
the manager for @entity28 now faces more chemotherapy and a mastectomy , but says she has received fantastic support especially from her husband @entity32 , 32			0

baby joy : @entity8 with @entity38			0
she is still undergoing cancer treatment she said : ' i went to the one - stop breast clinic at @entity17 and it was diagnosed there and then that i had a 6.5cm tumour			2
' it was just shocking , everything happened so quickly and there almost was n’t enough time to think about it			2
at that point , i thought " what is this going to do to my unborn baby ? "			0
' the type of chemotherapy that i had does n’t really harm unborn babies and i was encouraged to go to full term with my pregnancy			0
' i do n’t want to do draw attention to myself but to highlight the amazing care and support i have received @entity17			0
' and i want to offer any woman who finds herself in a similar situation a sense of hope and determination that a breast cancer diagnosis , especially in pregnancy , is not the end of the world and that it can be a positive , if tough , journey			1
' while breast cancer in pregnancy is rare - it affects about one in 3,000 pregnant women - it is the most common cancer diagnosed during pregnancy			2
pregnancy does n’t cause breast cancer , but it is believed that pregnancy hormones can accelerate the growth of breast cancer			0
with hindsight , mrs @entity8 , whose prognosis is good , can see that she was at a high risk of breast cancer after her mum and two maternal aunts were diagnosed with the disease			1
she said : ' you think you ’re invincible but you ’re not , and it shows how important raising awareness is			0
it is so important to check your breasts regularly at any age and if you find anything , whether you ’re male or female , to get it checked out			0
