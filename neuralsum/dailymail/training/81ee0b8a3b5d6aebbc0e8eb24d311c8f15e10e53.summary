’ shockingly , trigeminal neuralgia is known as the ‘ @entity12 ’ because 27 per cent of sufferers kill themselves because they are unable to bear the pain			1
professor @entity207 , a neurosurgeon at the privately - run @entity208 in @entity209 , and expert in the condition , said : ‘ research suggests the pain is caused by a blood vessel pressing against the trigeminal nerve and wearing away the nerve ’s protective myelin sheath			1
‘ sufferers experience these horrible electric shock - like feelings			0
‘ it mostly affects middle - aged and older people			0
this may be because blood vessels become gnarled and twisted with age , encroach over the nerve and wear down the insulating sheath			0
’ trigeminal neuralgia is a sudden and severe facial nerve pain - the pain is so severe that it drives many sufferers to suicide			1
as a result , it has been dubbed the ' suicide disease '			0
the pain has been described as like a stabbing or piercing pain			0
each attack lasts for between a few seconds and two minutes			0
the pain usually only affects one side of the face - most commonly the right side			2
triggers include talking , smiling , chewing , touch , swallowing and a cool breeze			0
in 80 to 90 per cent of patients the pain is caused by pressure on the trigeminal nerve - the largest nerve in the skull			1
the condition affects four or five people out of every 100,000			0
almost twice as many women as men are affected			0
it is most common in people between the ages of 60 and 70 and is very rare in under 40s			0
there is no cure for the condition which usually gets worse over time			0
treatment options include taking painkillers , or having surgery to relieve the pressure on the nerve			0
however , the pain sometimes recurs after the surgery			0

@entity9 first developed pain in his face and teeth in 2009
his gp and dentist at first thought it was caused by him grinding his teeth
he was eventually diagnosed with trigeminal neuralgia which is caused by pressure on the trigeminal nerve - the largest nerve in the skull
he suffered bouts of excruciating pain 250 times a day at the slightest touch
the pain is so bad that a quarter of sufferers commit suicide
surgeons at @entity54 's @entity53 removed part of his skull and wrapped his trigeminal nerve in @entity60
he has been pain free ever since the operation on september 3
