@entity0 is leaving @entity1 after presiding over the failed @entity3 website launch @entity1 chief operating officer @entity0 is on her way out after 41 years working for the federal government , but she wo n't leave without absorbing some final slings and arrows from critics of the @entity3			1
rep. @entity9 , the hard - charging conservative @entity10 who chairs the @entity12 , criticized @entity0 on monday for ' bypassing the recommendation of @entity1 ' top security expert ' before green - lighting the october 1 launch of healthcare.gov			1
those experts , @entity9 said in a statement , recommended a delay ' after independent testers raised concern about serious vulnerabilities from a lack of adequate security testing			1
' ' @entity26 seeking health insurance , ' he added , ' are left to shoulder the risk of a website that 's still an all - around work in progress because of the cult like commitment officials had to the arbitrary goal of launching on october 1			1
' @entity1 administrator @entity34 announced @entity0 's retirement monday , saying that he had planned to leave a year ago but stayed an extra 12 months at @entity34 's request to ' help me with the challenges facing @entity1 in 2013			1
' the federal government 's main @entity3 website was built at a cost that is now approaching $ 677 million , through contracts with technology companies that reported to @entity0			1
as the chronically troubled website is re-worked and its near - comical rollout enters its salvage phase , that role will now fall to @entity0 's deputy , @entity49 , who will take on her job on an ' acting ' basis			1
' she had to go , ' the official said			0
' she was responsible for the implementation of @entity3			0
she controlled all the resources to get it done			0
she was in charge of information technology			0
she controlled personnel and budget			0
' technically speaking , no one has been fired – or asked to resign – over @entity3 's flawed public introduction			1
by contrast , president @entity75 asked for the resignation of the @entity79 's acting director in may after a controversy erupted over the agency 's partisan use of the tax code to target politically conservative nonprofit organizations			2
meanwhile , five time zones away ... president @entity75 vacations in @entity86 as his healthcare team takes a hit with @entity0 's sudden departure during an october 30 congressional hearing , @entity91 secretary @entity90 blamed @entity0 for the epidemic of website crashes that accompanied the rollout , but moments later insisted that she herself should bear responsibility			1
in a heated exchange with @entity100 @entity99 rep. @entity99 , @entity90 named @entity0 as the @entity1 official who was in charge of the website 's building phase			1
' @entity0 is the one responsible for this debacle ? ' @entity106 demanded to know			2
' well , excuse me , congresswoman , ' came @entity90 ' answer			2
' @entity0 is not responsible for the debacle			2
hold me accountable for the debacle			0
' in the following weeks , @entity90 and other @entity75 administration officials shifted the blame to contractors including @entity113 , the highest - dollar recipient of taxpayer funds allocated to the project			2
@entity0 is the second official to step down from the @entity1 , a sub-agency of @entity91 , since @entity3 's rocky start			2
@entity1 chief information officer @entity119 left in november to take a private sector job			0
@entity91 released a report just weeks ago that blamed ' inadequate management oversight and coordination among technical teams ' for the healthcare.gov debacle			0
in response , @entity127 the management guru tapped to resolve the project 's outstanding problems , told reporters in a conference call that he believed ' healthcare.gov was fixable if we made significant changes to the management approach			2
' those changes included naming an outside company – one of the same firms involved with the site 's failed early construction – as its overall quarterback , or ' systems integrator , ' removing that role from @entity0 's office			1
rep. @entity9 slammed @entity0 for enforcing a ' cult like ' obsession with opening up healthcare.gov to the public when it was not yet ready for action during a congressional hearing , @entity91 secretary @entity90 named @entity0 as the top official at the helm of the failed website project , but fell on a rhetorical grenade by insisting that she herself was most to blame the website has functioned better in recent weeks , and @entity91 boasted over the weekend that 1.1 million @entity26 had enrolled in health plans through its federal - level insurance marketplace			1
fourteen states and the @entity160 run their own exchanges , likely adding hundreds of thousands more to that total			0
but @entity160 's own projections called for 3.3 million by year 's end , putting the @entity165 on a pace to reach just one - third of its overall goal of 7 million by march 31			0
but the administration 's latest statement provided no hint about how many – or how few – enrollees have paid premiums			0
additionally , there has been no word from insurers about how many of them will be covered on january 1			0
among healthcare.gov 's systemic problems is a back - end processing glitch that has garbled some records on their way to insurers and left others unsent entirely .			0

@entity0 is *voluntarily* stepping down from her role at the top of the healthcare.gov food chain
no one has been fired or asked to resign as a consequence of @entity54 's disastrous rollout
@entity10 rep. @entity9 slammed @entity0 for enforcing a ' cult like commitment ' to launch the site on october 1 despite its lack of *readiness*
@entity9 *complained* that @entity0 and @entity90 failed to plug *gaping* *online* security holes , leaving *consumers* open to fraud and identity theft
