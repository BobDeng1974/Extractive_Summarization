by @entity0 published : 19:07 est , 24 november 2013 updated : 19:08 est , 24 november 2013 the @entity1 was split yesterday on @entity3 ’s plans to limit access to benefits for @entity7 migrants , with a @entity9 minister saying it could ‘ put us on the wrong side ’ of @entity12			1
@entity14 , the @entity15 , said he would ‘ need to be persuaded ’ on proposals to impose a minimum period before newly - arrived migrants could claim handouts			1
however , @entity21 mayor @entity20 backed the prime minister ’s calls for restrictions , saying : ‘ it is clearly time for the @entity26 to take back more control of the terms under which @entity7 migrants arrive on our streets			1
split : @entity32 secretary @entity14 , left , says he would ' need to be persuaded ' regarding @entity3 's plans to limit access to benefits for @entity7 migrants , while @entity20 , right , has backed the plans ' we need much more flexibility to set conditions for claiming benefits			1
‘ i am in favour of immigration by talented and hard - working people , but the present system is mad : cracking down on @entity42 , @entity43 and high - spending @entity45 students and tourists , but completely incapable of dealing with a sizeable influx from within the @entity7 , some of whom show no sign of wanting to work			2
’ the reluctance to impose restrictions by the @entity9 comes despite even @entity54 accepting there should be controls to ensure immigrants do not come here from @entity12 purely to live a life on benefits			2
proposals : mr @entity3 plans to impose a minimum period before newly - arrived immigrants can claim benefits @entity64 , the shadow home secretary , yesterday said her party had suggested nine months ago it was in favour of transitionary limits on benefits for @entity69 and @entity70 moving to @entity26 after border controls are lifted on january 1			1
the comments will , however , raise eyebrows , because @entity54 refused to impose similar controls in 2004 when the borders were flung open to migrants from @entity77 and elsewhere in the @entity7			2
@entity78 has acted after two polls revealed deep public unease about immigration			2
on friday , a survey for the @entity83 showed more than four in five people did not want unrestricted access to the @entity26 for @entity69 and @entity70 , and said they were concerned the @entity86 and schools would be put under too much pressure			1
and a poll for @entity90 a day later showed that , by a huge margin , tightening border controls tops the wishlist for renegotiation of @entity26 ’s membership of the @entity7 before a referendum in 2017			1
the @entity83 revealed on saturday that new limits on @entity7 migrants who claim benefits in @entity26 are to be a key demand in the government ’s attempt to negotiate a looser relationship with @entity12			1
cabinet sources say that gaining the right to ‘ shut the door ’ on benefits for newcomers and existing migrants who have not lived here for a minimum period – possibly around six months – would be top of the list			0
details are expected to be announced by the prime minister soon , perhaps as early as this week			0
@entity78 ’s tough stance on migrants comes days after two polls revealed just how worried @entity26 are about border controls			1
on friday , a survey for the @entity83 showed 82 per cent would say no to free access to the @entity26 for @entity69 and @entity70			1
while on saturday , a survey for the @entity90 showed that despite voters being happy with @entity3 ’s stance on immigration controls , a poll of their priorities before he attempts to claw back powers from @entity127 put tightening border controls at the top			1
it led the next two highest - ranked priorities – human rights reform and expanding @entity134 trade – by a margin of 30 per cent			0
one @entity137 minister said : ‘ everyone knows we ’ve got to do something			0
’ but yesterday , mr @entity14 voiced concerns at imposing tougher conditions on @entity7 migrants amid fears about the number of @entity70 and @entity69 expected to come to the @entity26 from january			1
@entity3 is hopeful for support from a number of other @entity7 countries for curbs on ‘ welfare tourism ’			2
as many as 12 countries , including @entity152 , @entity153 and @entity154 , are understood to have concerns that large numbers of people are arriving only to claim generous benefits			0
all are demanding powers to limit the benefits that can be claimed – but so far the @entity161 has proved unwilling to change			0
the @entity161 has previously threatened @entity26 over plans to limit benefits handouts , claiming that they ‘ infringe the human rights ’ of @entity7 citizens			2
one cabinet minister said : ‘ the writing is on the wall for the way the @entity161 is behaving			0
other countries have also had enough			0
’ the move could trigger a clash with the @entity161 , which prevents member states from discriminating between their own citizens and those from other @entity7 members			0
the @entity9 mp told @entity179 ’s @entity178 that he could ‘ see the need for robust transitional arrangements ’ but he added : ‘ i would need to be persuaded of that , but i am prepared to look at the whole situation in the round			0
‘ potentially it might put us on the wrong side of the rest of the @entity7			0
it ’s something that we should be discussing with them , certainly			0
’ but @entity137 education secretary @entity191 also backed mr @entity3 ’s position yesterday			1
on the @entity179 ’s @entity193 he said : ‘ the prime minister … struck exactly the right note on migration , which is to celebrate the achievements of people who come here			0
‘ but when it comes to new migrants from accession countries in the @entity7 , we need to look properly at the benefits system to make sure people are coming here to work and contribute , not to take advantage of what is rightly a generous welfare system			0

@entity32 secretary @entity14 is *unsure* about @entity3 's proposals
but @entity20 said ' it 's time for the @entity26 to take back more control
