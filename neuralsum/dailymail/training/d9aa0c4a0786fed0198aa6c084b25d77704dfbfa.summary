a lawyer for @entity10 praised the decision not to prosecute his client			0
attorney @entity65 said : ' if what you report actually happened , then there were some very professional and brave people in @entity38 ’s office			0
' it is unclear whether the @entity72 acted properly in not signing the indictment			0

her parents remained suspects in the murder until finally being exonerated in 2008 horrific : @entity3 was found with her wrists tied above her head and duct tape over her mouth @entity38 , who left office in 2001 after 28 years as @entity93 's district attorney , declined to discuss the grand jury 's actions			1

' as the duly elected district attorney at the time and as an officer of the court then and now , i must respectfully decline further comment			1
' defending accusations : @entity4 and @entity10 hold a picture of their daughter during a press conference in 2000 where they released the results of an independent lie detector test , which revealed they had no knowledge of who killed their daughter under suspicion : the @entity37 arrive at their attorney 's office in august 2000 to answer questions about the death of their daughter christmas day , 1996 : parents of six - year - old @entity3 receive a ransom note demanding $ 118,000 @entity140 , 1996 : @entity3 found bludgeoned to death in the basement of her home in @entity35 , @entity36 @entity144 quickly placed her parents , @entity10 and @entity27 , under an ' umbrella of suspicion ' but they were never formally named as suspects detectives were later criticised for losing focus of the crime scene and other leads by concentrating on the family 2003 : dna taken from the victim 's clothes suggests the family were not involved 2006 : @entity27 dies of ovarian cancer august 2006 : former teacher @entity3 reportedly confesses to the murder while being held on child pornography charges			1
but no murder charge brought after his @entity153 found not to match that on @entity3 's body 2008 : @entity35 district attorney 's office clears parents of any wrongdoing and issues apology february 2009 : @entity168 takes the case back from the district attorney to reopen the investigation on christmas day of 1996 , the family received a ransom note saying that @entity3 had been kidnapped and were demanding $ 118,000 - the amount of a bonus mr @entity10 had recently received - or else she would be beheaded			1
but it was not long before her body was found in the basement of the house			0
her wrists were tied above her head , and she had duct tape over her mouth			0
an autopsy report revealed that she had been strangled and bludgeoned to death			2
within hours , the @entity37 themselves became the chief suspects of the investigation and police were later criticized for losing focus of the crime scene and other leads by concentrating on the family - including @entity3 's brother @entity193 - instead of following up other leads			2
for the next 12 years , the blame for their daughter 's death - who was given the name @entity202 - lay largely on their shoulders as they fought to clear their name and find the real killer			0
eventually , @entity35 district attorney ’s office completely cleared the @entity37 of any wrongdoing in their daughter ’s slaying and issued an apology in 2008			1
since then , @entity10 has kept the memory of his daughter alive , despite losing his reputation , a thriving business and @entity4 to ovarian cancer in 2006			0

basement case : this 1996 police video shows the basement hours after @entity3 's body was discovered last year , a former detective officially broke his silence over the investigation , saying that overlooked clues like cobwebs and a child 's toy could prove important in finding the killer in the high - profile cold case			1
in his self - published book , foreign faction : who really kidnapped @entity3 ? , former detective @entity240 reveals thousands of pages worth of investigations and police reports			2
he said he wanted the truth to be out in the public domain , and has a theory that a children ’s toy could be responsible for the marks on @entity3 ’s back			2
mr @entity10 , told police in 1996 that an intruder broke through a window in the basement			0
but in macabre police video that shows the basement hours after @entity3 was found dead , @entity255 pointed out that there are wispy cobwebs , moving ever so slightly			2
@entity255 speculates that an intruder would have brushed away the cobwebs upon entering the @entity10 ’s residence and thus @entity3 ’s killer would have already been inside the house .			0
