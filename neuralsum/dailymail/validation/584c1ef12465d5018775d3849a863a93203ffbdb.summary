the agony for @entity1 is that there are only eight games left in their late pursuit of the play - offs			1
the powerhouse winger showed improbable runs to glory can be completed with a solo goal to savour as manager @entity12 collected another three points			1
@entity15 ’s display was the story of this match			1
more than once he beat @entity20 ’s defenders for strength and pace before applying a deftness of touch			2
@entity1 striker @entity25 ( right ) tussles with @entity20 's @entity26 ( left ) @entity20 's @entity27 ( left ) slides in with a strong challenge on @entity1 's @entity29 ( right ) @entity1 winger @entity7 ( right ) vies for the ball with @entity32 's @entity31 ( left ) @entity1 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 ( @entity40 90 ) , @entity41 , @entity29 , @entity15 , @entity42 ( @entity43 79 ) subs not used : @entity46 , @entity45 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 booked : @entity38 scorers : @entity51 43 , @entity15 45 @entity20 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity52 , @entity31 ( @entity53 48 ) , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity27 ( @entity57 57 ) , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 ( @entity63 75 ) subs not used : @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 booked : @entity27 , @entity58 referee : @entity70 attendance : 20,569 his goal , as the interval approached , was a combination of his talents			1
picking up the ball well inside his own half , he turned and galloped			1
he checked inside @entity31 , sped clear of @entity58 , cut across @entity54 and unleashed a shot from 25 yards that flew into the bottom corner			2
there was an inevitability about it all			2
@entity37 will be credited with the assist but in much the same way a tee might aid a 300 - yard drive by @entity89			2
it was @entity15 ’s 13th goal of the season since a £ 1.5million move from @entity94 wednesday			1
what a bit of business that now looks			0
@entity25 ( centre ) rides the challenges of @entity99 ( left ) and @entity27 ( right ) @entity99 ( left ) is fouled by @entity29 ( right ) during the @entity101 match at @entity102 two minutes earlier @entity15 had set up the opener , lofting a ball into the path of @entity25			1
the striker crept behind @entity107 and lobbed a finish that goalkeeper @entity52 got a hand to but in vain			0
the result extends @entity12 ’s record to seven wins , two draws , and one defeat since taking over from @entity115			0
@entity116 , in sixth , are eight points ahead			0
it seems just too much , but you never know			0
@entity20 are in a similar predicament at the other end			0
@entity123 ’ team sit six points above the drop zone			0
they mounted a challenge of sorts in the second half , and very nearly pulled one back when @entity99 sent a sweet shot against the post			2
@entity33 then produced a magnificent save with 17 minutes left when diving to keep out @entity59 ’s firm shot			0
@entity51 ( right ) opens the scoring for @entity1 during their 2 - 0 win over @entity20 on wednesday night he is congratulated by @entity1 team - mate @entity138 ( top ) as @entity1 make a late charge for the play - offs with the match won , @entity12 gave 18 - year - old @entity40 , son of @entity1 legend des , his debut as an injury time substitute			1
@entity123 said : ‘ it ’s a cruel game , we were the better side in the first half for long spells			2
’ but the night belonged to @entity15			1
‘ every team needs a bit of magic and certainly @entity7 gives us that , ’ said @entity12			1
he added a thinly veiled call to neighbours @entity156 , who have not won in five games			0
‘ of course the season is finishing too early but we need to make sure we take care of business and keep on winning , ’ @entity12 said			1
‘ it ’s a fierce competition like i ’ve never seen			0
teams above us are really panicking			0
certain teams that are not too far away from us location-wise			0
’ @entity15 has scored 13 goals since his £ 1.5 million move from @entity167 last summer @entity1 's @entity34 ( left ) dribbles with the ball ahead of @entity99 ( right ) at @entity102			1
