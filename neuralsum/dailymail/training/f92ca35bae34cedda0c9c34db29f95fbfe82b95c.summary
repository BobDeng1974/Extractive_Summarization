by @entity0 for @entity1 wine and dine : sweets such as wine gums are good for a quick energy boost i am 73 and running in my first half marathon			1
can you advise me on diet , both before the event and on the day ? firstly , congratulations on stepping up to the challenge ! in the @entity12 last year , only four per cent of marathon - runners were over the age of 65 , so you ’re part of a fitness elite			1
your nutritional needs before and during the event wo n’t differ significantly from your fellow runners , but your age does mean there are a few things to consider when it comes to your recovery			1
during training , it ’s common wisdom that you should significantly increase your carb intake because the body ’s preferred fuel for running ( or any endurance sport ) is glycogen , which is how the body stores carbohydrate			1
aim for 60 to 70 per cent of your daily calories to come from carbs , which can be in the form of whole grains , fruit , vegetables and low - fat dairy products			1
endurance runners also need 50 per cent more protein than sedentary adults ( about 12 to 15 per cent of your daily calories ) , as it ’s essential for muscle growth and repair			1
to figure out the right amount , multiply your weight in kilograms by 1.3 , or your weight in pounds by 0.6 , to calculate the number of grams of protein you should consume per day			1
on race day , seasoned marathon - runners refuel regularly – before the tank runs out – with concentrated energy sources			1
there are specific products for this , like sports drinks , chews and gels , but wine gums and other sweets are popular			1
another trick is to drink beetroot juice before the race , as it helps blood vessels dilate and increases blood flow to muscles during exercise			1
which brings us to recovery nutrition			1
older runners are more susceptible to muscle damage – upping your intake of @entity79 , omega - 3 , sulphur - containing amino acids , bioflavonoids and antioxidants in the weeks after your race will help rebuild and maintain muscle tone and strength			1
good luck ! my husband and i really need to slim down , but it ’s hard to know where to start			1
when our daughters were younger , we got lots of exercise running around after them or going on healthy walks , but they ’ve long since left home			1
i do n’t think we eat badly , we do n’t eat ready meals or junk food and i do n’t have a sweet tooth , except for a few sugars in my tea			1
but clearing out a cupboard recently , i found a favourite old dress – size 10 , and i ’m now squeezing into a 16			1
i ’m worried for my husband ’s health as he ’s bigger than his father was when he died of a heart attack			1
there ’s a trendy local gym but it ’s not for us – we ’re both mid- 50s			2
my daughter got me down to a @entity114 class but i hated it			2
what else can we do to lose weight ? self control : @entity0 advices a woman to start eating smaller portions and cut out the daily sugar in her tea you ’re right to address this issue now			2
the earlier you can get down to a healthy weight , the better – especially with your husband ’s family history of heart disease			2
about 75 per cent of weight loss is down to what you eat and it ’s great that you cook your own meals , because it should be easy for you to start planning lighter options			2
simply eating less – aka portion control – is the first place to start ! my friend @entity137 bought smaller plates to stop her overeating			2
as a visual guide , each meal should be able to fit comfortably into your two cupped hands			2
be really honest with yourselves about how much you snack between meals ; try sticking to a solid three meals a day			2
keeping a food diary will help you keep track			2
those sugars in your tea all add up , too			0
there are roughly 30 calories in two teaspoons of sugar , so at four cups a day that ’s 120 calories – the equivalent of a small packet of crisps			0
time to cut it out			0
have you ever thought about trying a vegan diet ? following the guidelines in the hit book @entity163 , which recommends a plant - based , wholefood diet as a way to combat all kinds of health issues , helped @entity169 , also a high - risk candidate for heart disease , drop more than two stone			0
and who says your healthy walks have to stop just because your daughters have left home ? if you ’re lucky enough to live somewhere you can get out and go rambling , make the most of it			0
it sounds as if long walks with your husband are something you ’ll both enjoy			0
@entity183 way or the highway : @entity185 likes to keep herself - and her men - in shape on the subject of exercise for couples , i love the story about @entity185 sending her new squeeze @entity194 ( the co-creator of @entity195 ) off to train with scary @entity196			0
fitness fanatic @entity185 is rumoured to work out two hours a day , six days a week to maintain her trim physique , and obviously wants her man showing the same commitment			0
while we ca n’t all be expected to maintain an a-list exercise regime like theirs , working out with your other half can be a great motivator in achieving your fitness goals			0
a word of caution though , @entity185 – @entity211 ’s method involves eating a lot of puree , and i ’m pretty sure the way to a man ’s heart is n’t through feeding him baby food ... festival season is a distant memory – but one ‘ did i dream that ’ moment that keeps coming back to me was conservative mp @entity223 ’s talk on astrology for health with @entity228 star - gazer @entity227			0
as vice-chairman of the government ’s herbals working group , to say mr @entity223 – who openly champions complimentary medicine – is outspoken would be an understatement			0
he now seems to be giving @entity237 a run for his money by admitting he believes studying your astrological chart can give vital clues into an individual ’s health and wellbeing			0
well , @entity223 , i salute you ! i find astrology fascinating , and in the @entity250 @entity249 medical system , used by millions of people , working with the planets is often key to diagnosing the right course of treatment			0
the idea is that the horoscope is a blueprint of the whole being , reflecting the complex interaction of body , mind and spirit			1
i take the odd painkiller , rarely , and am lucky never to get ill. i was raised with homeopathy as the family go - to for many everyday ailments			0
i know a lot of people out there think its all crackpot stuff , but tell me this : is exploring alternatives more or less foolish than the constant antibiotic overuse that has left us on the brink of these life - saving drugs becoming useless ? @entity276 is the latest digestive ailment for neurotic @entity278			1
the unappetising ‘ condition ’ is blamed for everything from food allergies , low energy levels and joint pain to thyroid disease , autoimmune conditions and a slow metabolism			0
it refers to a weakened gut wall developing holes that allow undigested food particles , bacteria and toxins to pass into the blood stream			0
@entity294 and bloating can be early symptoms , while multiple food sensitivities are another giveaway			0
common causes are said to be stress , poor diet and eating unsprouted grains , sugar , genetically modified crops and dairy products			0
do you do you have a @entity307 ? email us at fitinthecity@mailonsunday.co.uk or write to @entity310 , @entity1 , 2 @entity311 , @entity312			0
