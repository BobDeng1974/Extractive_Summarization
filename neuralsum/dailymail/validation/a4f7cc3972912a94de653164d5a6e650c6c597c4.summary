the build - up to @entity3 ’s @entity2 quarter - final against @entity4 has inevitably rekindled memories of their epic encounter in 1999 ; @entity8 ’s sending - off , @entity10 ’s penalty save and @entity11 ’ mazy , mesmerising winner followed by a shirt - stripping celebration			1
@entity3 ’s semi-final victory at @entity16 that night came to epitomise sir @entity18 ’s treble - winning team			1
the penchant for high drama			0
the never - say - die spirit that he instilled in his players			0
and a ‘ we ’ll score more goals than you ’ attitude in going toe - to - toe with any opponent , be it @entity31 or @entity32			0
so as @entity3 prepare to face the @entity34 again for a place at @entity36 on monday night , it ’s perhaps understandable if their supporters are growing disillusioned by the brand of football being offered up by @entity41 ’s team			1
@entity11 ( right ) scored arguably the greatest @entity2 goal in @entity3 's 1999 win over @entity4 @entity11 watches his left - foot strike fly past @entity45 as defender @entity46 slides in too late @entity11 ' semi-final winner was followed by a shirt - stripping celebration in an iconic moment at @entity16 @entity3 won the @entity50 with @entity53 's late @entity52 strike against @entity54 it does n’t seem to matter what tactics the @entity56 employs , the result seems to be the same			1
whether it ’s down to a three - man defence , a midfield diamond , or simply a case of launching high balls up to @entity63 , @entity3 simply have n’t been very entertaining this season			1
there is a caution , a lethargy , to @entity69 ’s side at odds with the traditions of the club			0
@entity11 espoused it when he was installed as caretaker manager for the final four games of last season			2
‘ it ’s going to be my philosophy , @entity3 ’s philosophy , ’ said @entity11 at the time			2
‘ i want players to play with passion , speed , tempo and be brave with imagination – all the things that are expected of a @entity3 player			2
@entity3 ’s philosophy is to attack			2
’ no wonder the @entity89 legend seemed a little underwhelmed as @entity69 turned to him to celebrate a late 1 - 0 win over @entity92 last week			0
current @entity3 boss @entity41 has been criticised for his brand of football this season @entity69 's philosophy this season is different to @entity3 's trademark cavalier style of play @entity101 ( right ) leads the way as @entity3 's current crop prepare to face @entity4 in the @entity2 @entity104 , @entity63 and @entity105 ( @entity106 ) could all start against the @entity34 at @entity89 @entity107 , @entity11 ’s former team - mate who joined him on the coaching staff for that brief stint last year , has described @entity3 ’s football as ‘ miserable ’			1
‘ @entity3 ’s history was built on attacking football , which does not always mean that the team kept clean sheets or did not concede chances , ’ says @entity107			1
‘ to beat opposing teams you have to attack , and to attack you have to take risks			0
too few of the players in the current team are prepared to take those risks			0
’ @entity18 ’s teams did not always dazzle on the big stage , of course			0
the goalless 2005 fa cup final against @entity4 ranks as one of the worst in recent memory , though largely due to the negative tactics employed by @entity128 before his side won on a penalty shootout			1
equally , @entity3 ’s 1979 final against the @entity34 is lauded as one of the classics by those who sometimes forget that the first 85 minutes were pretty turgid			2
sir @entity18 guided @entity3 to 13 @entity136 titles during his 1,500 games in charge of the club @entity140 ( left ) led @entity3 to four @entity136 titles during the 1990s @entity142 ( right ) was the epitome of @entity3 's pleasing - on - the - eye style during his time at the club @entity147 was in charge of @entity3 that day			2
his sacking two years later in 1981 was attributed to the fact that his team were just too boring even though @entity3 had just ended the season with seven straight wins , typically six of them by a one - goal margin			1
it is a reminder that results are not always everything at @entity89 as @entity69 continues to build on an impressive record of just two defeats in 22 games			0
@entity147 paid the price for failing to play the @entity3 way ; a cavalier style built on width and speed and a commitment to attack and entertain the fans			2
‘ all those lads you see going to the factory in @entity176 , they come to watch you on saturday , ’ sir @entity168 told a teenage @entity169 on his arrival at the club			0
‘ they have boring jobs , so you have to give them something they will enjoy			0
’ @entity147 ( centre ) was sacked as @entity3 manager in 1981 after failing to play the @entity3 way @entity3 supporters displayed a banner demanding the sacking of @entity18 during the late 1980 's @entity188 embraced @entity168 ’s philosophy			1
@entity190 too , though neither with the greatest success			0
when home attendances dropped to 33,000 during @entity18 ’s darkest period in late 1989 , it was largely down to a dreadful run of results that left @entity3 hovering above the relegation zone			1
one could argue that @entity3 are not much worse to watch under @entity69 than they were under @entity199 , with better results			2
but fans expect more from the £ 150million spent last summer and the names on the team sheet			0
they find it hard to take when @entity205 is dropped into midfield , @entity63 goes up front , and @entity208 of all people gets to label their team ‘ @entity210 ’			1
in recent weeks , they have taken to urging their team to ‘ attack , attack , attack ’ and booed when the ball is passed back to @entity104			0
@entity69 is understandably proud of the fact that he has won a trophy in his first season at each of his clubs			0
but as @entity3 aim to move a step closer to lifting the @entity2 for a record 12th time , he would do well to remember that style counts every bit as much as silverware at @entity89			1
@entity227 's form has dropped alarmingly after a bright start at @entity89 following his summer move @entity230 ( centre ) was substituted at half - time during @entity3 's 2 - 0 win at home to @entity235 last month deploying @entity63 ( right ) as a makeshift forward has also received negative feedback this term			1

@entity3 face @entity4 in the @entity2 sixth round on monday night
@entity3 boss @entity41 has been criticised for his tactics this season
@entity205 striker @entity205 has been deployed largely in midfield this term
midfielder @entity63 has been used as a target centre forward too
