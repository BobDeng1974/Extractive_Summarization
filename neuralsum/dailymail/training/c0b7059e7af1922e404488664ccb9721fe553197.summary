inside the @entity2 on sunday july 13 , a decade of planning and preparation was finally realised when @entity3 lifted @entity5 ’s fourth @entity4			1
they were a tournament team , built to last the distance in @entity8 under the astute guidance of their coach @entity10			1
on tuesday , in @entity14 ’s first major interview since @entity15 exited the @entity4 with one point , he suggested we are on the same upward trajectory			1
here comes the killer quote , delivered by @entity14 at our national stadium , from tuesday 's interview on @entity22 : ‘ i do n’t believe in the nonsense spoken about the identity of certain countries and how they play , ’ claimed @entity15 ’s head coach			1
‘ i do n’t see a vast amount different between how we try and the way @entity5 try to play			1
@entity49 , cast in the same role as @entity40 that night , had just 42			2
until @entity14 , or someone else in his position for that matter , accepts that @entity5 are currently operating at an elite level we have no chance of catching them , let alone overtaking them			1
‘ now there is a major difference between the 11 players in the @entity63 shirt and the 11 players in the @entity15 shirt , ’ added @entity14			1
‘ but if we are talking about how they attack and build up their attacks			2
or how they keep possession and seek for openings when they have got the ball , i don ’ t see a vast amount of difference in philosophy or style			2
@entity79 things that happen in the game make all the difference			0
i could give you six or seven examples from the @entity4 that made winners into losers			1
’ @entity15 were losers , beaten by @entity87 in their opening group game in @entity89 and swatted aside by the brilliance of @entity91 when they played @entity92 in @entity93			1
hard to take : @entity14 watched his @entity15 team lose to @entity92 - after going down to @entity87 hard to take : @entity95 was comforted by @entity91 after the @entity96 wrecked his @entity4 let us not forget that this @entity15 team were out of the @entity4 before 12 teams had even played their second game			1
they left with one point , as did @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105			2
@entity14 did n’t offer to resign after being backed by @entity107 chairman @entity106			2
the football ’s broke , but we are not prepared to do anything to fix it			0
‘ i would quite happily relinquish this job when my employers do n’t want me here any more and the players do n’t have the respect necessary and they do n’t want to continue to play for me , ’ added @entity14			1
‘ in that moment , if it is time for me to walk away i will do so			0
but this time it was made clear to me that that was n’t the situation , that the @entity107 wanted me to continue in the job and the feedback within the team was the same			0
‘ you walk away when you ca n’t stand the pressure , or you do n’t feel you are good enough to do the job and in that situation i can safely and strongly say that i never felt that at all			0
‘ as a result we have to look forward to 2016 and make certain that we do n’t allow it to happen again and hope we do n’t have the same lack of fortune			0
’ @entity131 - breaker @entity130 retires from international football @entity133 : @entity134 was the @entity63 hero with the winner against @entity136 in the @entity4 final two bad : @entity91 ( right ) beat @entity138 ( left ) twice as @entity15 lost 2 - 1 to @entity92 @entity15 play a friendly against @entity140 at @entity141 on september 3 before the @entity143 qualifier , against @entity144 in @entity145 , five days later			1
there will have to be some restructuring of the team , in part due to captain @entity95 ’s retirement from international duty			0
‘ it was n’t easy for him to turn his back on @entity15 because he so much enjoyed playing for @entity15 and he ’s done such a good job for us , ’ added @entity14			1
‘ i went through all the possible discussion points that you could have and i made my points of why i wanted him to stay on and he promised to give it a thought			0
’ another captain , likely to be @entity49 , will be chosen next month as @entity14 attempts to repair some of the damage from @entity15 ’s disastrous @entity4			1
‘ we do n’t need to compare ourselves to other @entity168 countries , let ’s just stay as @entity15 , ’ he said			2
‘ i have got a big job to choose that captain			0
i have half - chosen him			0
the person who is captain for the @entity140 game will be the person i will be designating to hopefully be the captain in 2016			0
‘ we have a lot of rebuilding to do , not only of our team but also rebuilding all the faith that people showed us			0
’ prices for @entity15 ’s next game against @entity140 at @entity141 are priced at £ 30 , £ 40 , £ 50 and £ 60			2
family enclosure tickets are priced at £ 20 and £ 10 for @entity182 's			0
there is a large family enclosure for this match and over half of the tickets sold will be under £ 30 if demand dictates			0
if you can get this in i ’d be grateful			0

@entity15 boss @entity14 believes @entity15 are not to far away from @entity5 in their style of play
@entity5 won a fourth @entity4 with victory against @entity136 in the final
@entity15 exited @entity8 with just one point from the group stages
