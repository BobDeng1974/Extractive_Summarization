there is a well - worn saying that footballers should always play the game , not the occasion			2
given that sunday 's eagerly - anticipated @entity6 clash will be the first for many of those on the pitch , that adage seems particularly poignant			2
derby debutants could do a lot worse than talk to @entity13			1
the @entity15 legend was no stranger to high - pressure semi-finals before arriving at @entity15 in 1991 , having won the @entity17 and @entity18 with @entity19			2
@entity13 ( right ) was sent off in his first game playing for @entity21 against @entity22 @entity21 boss @entity23 poses with the @entity24 ahead of the @entity6 clash with @entity22 yet in his first @entity6 last - four encounter wearing the blue shirt of @entity21 — a @entity17 showdown against @entity22 at @entity29 — he let the hype and hubris get the better of him			1
then a 23 - year - old left - back , @entity13 's afternoon lasted just six minutes after he was shown a straight red for a body - check on @entity36 winger @entity35			1
' i lasted six minutes in the semi in 1992 and that 's what i 'm famous for now , ' reflected @entity13 , who was back at @entity29 studying for his @entity41 this week			1
' it 's the most nerve - racking game i ever had			2
' after i was sent off , i went into the dressing room and i heard all of this thumping from people banging on the old wooden stairs			0
' @entity49 ( @entity21 kit man @entity50 ) came running in and told me it was a goal and i was thinking : ' oh no. ' but it was @entity54 ( @entity53 ) who had scored to put us 1 - 0 up and i went to watch the second half			1
' @entity22 did what they did in those days and pounded us to death			1
we managed to hang on and i was more relieved than anyone else			0
it was a great occasion but i still felt as though i had let everyone down			0
' amongst the current @entity21 camp , seven have experienced the derby against @entity22 — but for the likes of @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68 , sunday 's @entity18 semi-final at @entity29 will be their first taste			1
@entity67 has never played for @entity21 in an @entity6 against @entity22 before @entity13 ( right ) — who won six league titles with @entity21 during the nine - in - a - row era — warned that nothing can quite prepare a player for the intensity of the fixture			1
' i 've played in @entity21 games against @entity19 and for @entity19 against @entity22 , big games , but in my first @entity6 you could n't hear anyone , ' he added			1
' i was trying to give an instruction to @entity84 ( @entity85 ) and he could n't hear me			0
you are almost on your own			0
' my first game was at @entity88			0
i 'd go and take a throw - in and people are spitting on you and doing all sorts of stuff			0
obviously , those days have changed a little bit			0
' it 's going to be a strange atmosphere there and , hopefully , the @entity21 supporters forget about the turmoil that 's going on and really get behind the team and make it a bit of a spectacle			1
' they are the underdogs , probably for the first time in a long time in any game , but it 's a good chance for the team and the players to try to prove people wrong , ' added the now 46 - year - old @entity13 , currently a director of boys coaching at @entity109 in @entity110 , @entity111			1
@entity13 ( right ) wants @entity21 to show their character against favourites @entity22 on sunday ' @entity21 will need to show their character			1
it 's the first time the clubs have met since all of the problems and now they are on their way back up			0
' every cup tie they have played on that journey against @entity126 opposition , they have been expected to win			0
so this is the first where there is n't any expectation because all of the pressure will be on @entity22			2
' you never know what will happen in a cup semi-final			2
all of these guys will relish playing in this game and they will see what 's at stake			0
it will give them an escape from all of the drama that 's going on at the moment			0
' @entity13 was speaking at the @entity144 's @entity41 course			2
