monday , january 17 , 1966 , will forever be a day of embarrassment for the @entity1 , and one of infamy for the village of @entity5 on @entity8 ’s @entity7 coast			1
it was on that day that a giant b - 52 bomber from the @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 , was completing a 24 - hour global patrol at the height of the @entity16			1
nestling in the bomb bay was a deadly cargo : four 1.5 megaton @entity19 thermonuclear hydrogen bombs , each about 70 times more powerful than the atomic bomb that devastated @entity23			1
devastating : on january 17 in 1966 , two @entity1 planes collided mid-air and dropped four nuclear bombs over @entity5 on the @entity7 coast on the last leg of the flight towards home , during refuelling at 31,000ft with a kc - 135 tanker , disaster struck			1
an official investigation later concluded that the @entity35 overran in manoeuvres to hook up with the trailing fuel boom and rammed the tanker			1
there was an explosion and a huge fireball engulfed both aircraft			1
all four men on the tanker and three of the bomber ’s crew died instantly			1
four others managed to eject before plunging into the sea where they were rescued by @entity8 fishermen			2
and the h - bombs ? mercifully there was no detonation			1
but while one splashed into the @entity56 and a second drifted down on its parachute and landed intact in a dried - up river bed , the remaining two bombs split open upon impact , scattering plutonium and covering the tomato fields of @entity5 with a fine and deadly radioactive dust			1
the rest of the world has mostly forgotten – or simply does n’t care			0
today ’s holidaymakers are as oblivious to this brush with @entity68 as they are ignorant of the ancient history of these beaches where @entity72 ’s war elephants once landed			0
the reality , however , is that @entity8 ’s so - called @entity74 is scarred for ever – and that the toxic legacy is getting worse , not better			1
there are 1,600 residents in this tiny farming and fishing village , half of them expatriate @entity80 , and they are understandably alarmed about the vast acres of ‘ no - go ’ farmland where , even now , men in masks drill deep down to search for the decaying remnants of h - bombs			1
no go area : a sign warns against entering one of the still - contaminated areas near the village of @entity5 deadly legacy : @entity95 sailors recover one of the @entity98 bombs , still wrapped in its parachute , that fell into the sea , in april , four months after the crash they are dismayed that @entity95 ’s promises to clean up the mess they made have never been fulfilled , despite continuing pressure from the @entity8 government			1
and they are furious that while @entity95 has fined @entity111 £ 2.5 billion for violating @entity95 environmental and pollution laws after the 2010 @entity115 oil spill , it has so far paid the residents of @entity5 a pittance of £ 353,000 for the ruination of their livelihoods and , quite possibly , their health			1
the nuclear accident was not on the agenda when @entity95 president @entity123 met @entity8 prime minister @entity124 in january , despite assurances made by the @entity95 @entity126 , @entity127 , that he would personally ‘ look into the matter in detail ’			1
‘ the @entity8 government has been negotiating with the @entity95 for years without success to return and get rid of the radiation threat , ’ said 70 - year - old @entity130 , originally from @entity131 , near @entity132 in @entity133 , who now lives near @entity5			1
‘ it ’s alarming when more hot spots keep being found that blight the land on which the farmers depend for their livelihood			0
’ his wife @entity141 , 71 , added : ‘ we ’re disgusted at the way the @entity95 have been bullying the @entity80 over the @entity115 oil spill disaster			0
‘ there ’s little sign of that “ special relationship ” and no sign of president @entity123 fulfilling the promise to clean up the h - bomb mess in @entity5			1
’ @entity152 , another local expat , who is from @entity153 , @entity154 , said : ‘ @entity95 ’s lack of effort to come and clean up the nuclear poison is a disgrace			2
many farming families have given up and left because they ’re banned from growing crops in certain areas			0
’ indeed , the passage of time has only made the problem more deadly still			0
nearly five decades on , the plutonium has degraded to become americium , a substance that emits lethal alpha particles			2
‘ i would be very surprised if local people have n’t suffered already some increased risk of cancer , or leukaemia or lymphoma , ’ explained @entity80 scientist dr @entity173			0
‘ they should be very concerned			0
‘ in 1966 it was n’t appreciated how dangerous this stuff was			2
then the emphasis was mainly on external radiation and gamma doses			0
but after years of research , we know that internal radioactive particles , like plutonium , are singularly hazardous			2
’ dr @entity173 , who serves on the @entity186 , said : ‘ hot particles would burn a hole through your gut causing colon or lung cancers , or if they were small enough would pass through the lymphatic system causing lymphomas and leukaemia			0
’ environmentalists accuse @entity8 and @entity95 scientists of secrecy about health checks among @entity5 residents			1
each year 150 are sent to @entity201 for physical examinations			0
the @entity8 government claims only small levels of radiation have been detected though in several cases plutonium has attached itself to their bones			2
‘ i think the public has a right to know if this disaster has had consequences for their health , ’ said @entity209 , of @entity210			0
‘ the type of radiation now being emitted after almost 50 years is totally different			0
’ it is true that , back in the 1960s , @entity95 originally spent more than £ 10 million recovering the intact bombs from the @entity56 and the dried - up river bed			1
the authorities shipped out 4,810 barrels of radioactive soil for burial at the @entity227 headquarters in @entity228 , @entity229			0
more radiological ‘ hot spots ’ have recently been discovered around the village and sealed off , along with a large area right in the centre of the village and others by the local cemetery and in neighbouring @entity236			2
in nearby foothills , where lettuce had been grown for many years , @entity8 scientists have made a grim discovery			0
masked and wearing protective clothing , they were drilling to establish whether alpha particles had leached underground into the water table			0
instead they located two trenches 30ft wide and 100ft long emitting high radiation levels			0
they also found the area was contaminated with americium , the disintegrating product of plutonium			1
buried here are thought to be remnants of the two h - bombs that broke open and wreckage of the two planes that collided and crashed			1
at some point , and at massive expense , the debris will have to be dug up and shipped across the @entity262 back to the @entity95 as it should have been in 1966			2
@entity95 stands accused of secrecy about the location of the trenches			0
@entity95 @entity268 officials admit knowing about their existence , but not exactly where they are , claiming no proper notes or maps were kept back in the 1960s			0
now the governments in @entity275 and @entity201 continue to squabble over the best way forward			0
scientists from @entity278 , the @entity279 , want a complex three - year plan that would involve vacuum - sealed tents and compacting contaminated soil and debris into bricks			1
the b - 52 bomber from the @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 , has been on global patrol over @entity287 loaded with ur 1.5 megaton @entity19 thermonuclear hydrogen bombs when it collided with a tanker mid-air it ’s an operation that could cost more than £ 20 million			1
the @entity95 disagree , saying the fastest and most cost - effective solution would be to shovel the debris into barrels and ship them out for burial in @entity229			2
but the scientists concede that once the land has been surgically cleaned , radiation will still persist and still have to be monitored			0
@entity300 is one of the most toxic materials and as it degrades into americium it takes 24,400 years for even half of a given amount to dissipate			0
this is the reason why , since 1966 , air monitors have been installed in and around @entity5 , crops and animals are regularly examined , and why over 1,000 villagers have had to undergo more than 4,000 physical examinations			1
although test results have never been made public , they reveal that five per cent of those screened by doctors are carrying plutonium in their bodies , which is attached to their bones			2
however , none of the villagers affected have been told about this , only that their annual medical check - ups are satisfactory			2
after 20 years , an estimated 75 per cent of the plutonium will remain in their bodies			2
the official view has always been that the population was exposed to only small levels of plutonium			2
there are suspicions , though , that some of those in the area died young after the h - bombs fell			1
some farmers and their families have spoken about deaths from cancer and other mysterious illnesses following the accident			0
@entity344 , the @entity8 dictator , was in power at the time and medical records were destroyed or suppressed			0
he was enraged that the disaster should threaten what was then the country ’s fledgling tourism industry			0
today , two of the h - bombs , battered and bruised , rest in peace thousands of miles away at the @entity355 in @entity356 , safely stripped of their lethal plutonium contents			1
the original decontamination involved 7,000 @entity95 troops who burned crops and scraped up three inches of topsoil			0
as is now all - too clear , however , the operation was far from complete			2
after almost half a century , @entity5 ’s nuclear nightmare is set to continue – for centuries to come			1
@entity365 is a former @entity366 correspondent and author of @entity368 they lost the @entity369 .			0

two @entity1 planes - a @entity35 and a tanker collided mid-air in 1966
@entity35 carried four nuclear bombs , three fell over @entity5 in @entity7
*non-nuclear* explosives in two of the weapons detonated upon impact
the explosion contaminated a 0.78 square mile area with plutonium
