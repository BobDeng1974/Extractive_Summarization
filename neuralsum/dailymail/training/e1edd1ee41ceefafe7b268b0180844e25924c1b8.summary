the emirate is known for its multi-millionaire petrolheads , who drive around the wealthy state in some of the world 's finest vehicles			2
not to be outdone , the force 's officers are now cruising around in a @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 - all capable of speeds in excess of 190mph			1
try getting away from this : one of the @entity6 police force 's super vehicles , a £ 1.6million @entity27 one - 77 money no object : the force has been kitted out with all manner of super-fast cars , including this @entity33 please arrest me : apparently people booked for speeding have actually asked to be taken to the station in the swish new cars , including this @entity39 they have even kitted out a £ 1.6 million @entity40 with lights and stripes			1
making up the extraordinary fleet of patrol cars are the force 's @entity45 and @entity47 - with all of the performance vehicles decked out in full police livery			1
has been driving around @entity6 in a 217mph @entity52 police car for the past six weeks			2
he said : ' i have issued about 30 tickets to drivers blocking the traffic and parking in prohibited places			1
the swish blue line : inside one of the force 's @entity62 action : the supercars were brought in to clamp down on speeding , which is a real problem in @entity6 purpose : cars like this @entity70 could help bring down the number of road deaths ' but the most amazing thing about driving such a car is how people look at you with a big smile			2
' deaths on the road are a common occurrence in the @entity81 , with one person killed in a traffic incident every 26 hours			0
most of these deaths are caused by speeding , driving without a seatbelt and driving while using mobile phones			2
deadly : one person is killed every 26 hours in traffic accidents raw power : the @entity33 , right , and @entity52 , left , outside one of @entity6 's police stations largesse : money was no object for the force when it upgraded its fleets of vehicles			0
here 's its @entity52 the police recently announced anyone caught exceeding 125mph would face legal action and it is hoped the presence of 700bhp supercars will make boy racers think twice			0
following the arrival of the supercars , some motorists are thought to have actually asked to be arrested in the hope they can be taken back to the local nick in a @entity19			1
@entity108 , who personally owns a @entity109 , patrols the streets in a @entity33 unmistakable : the @entity52 is in full @entity6 police livery @entity113 - inspiring : even the officers ca n't believe their luck that they get to drive cars like the @entity33 she said : ' it is the first time i have driven a sports car			0
when they chose me i could n't believe it			0
