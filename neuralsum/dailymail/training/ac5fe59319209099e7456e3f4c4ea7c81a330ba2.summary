by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 03:50 est , 9 december 2013 updated : 18:12 est , 9 december 2013 lifting the lid : former @entity4 systems analyst @entity3 revealed the extent of state spying eight of the world ’s largest technology companies have urged @entity10 and other leaders to rein in internet surveillance			1
firms including @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 signed a joint letter warning that in many countries the balance between security and individual freedom is tipped too far in the state ’s favour			1
it comes after former intelligence operative @entity3 disclosed details of mass surveillance techniques used by the @entity28 and @entity29			2
in their letter to president @entity10 and @entity31 , the firms said : ‘ we understand that governments have a duty to protect their citizens			2
but this summer ’s revelations highlighted the urgent need to reform government surveillance practices worldwide			1
’ the rare show of unity by usually fierce competitors is seen as a reflection of the damage in public confidence inflicted by leaks from the former @entity4 contractor - turned - whistleblower @entity3			1
earlier this year he revealed how @entity28 and @entity29 spy agencies were able to harvest huge amounts of data - including emails and search history - on millions of people by tapping into internet servers			2
in the open letter to president @entity10 and @entity31 , the company chiefs said states had trampled on constitutional rights with the wholesale trawling of citizens ' internet information			0
they demanded better oversight of government surveillance operations and new legal limits on how states can obtain sensitive , private information			1
it read : ' the balance in many countries has tipped too far in favor of the state and away from the rights of the individual - rights that are enshrined in our @entity74			0
this undermines the freedoms we all cherish			0
it 's time for change			0
' for our part , we are focused on keeping users ' data secure , deploying the latest encryption technology to prevent unauthorized surveillance on our networks , and by pushing back on government requests to ensure that they are legal and reasonable in scope			1
call for change : @entity14 ceo @entity91 urged president @entity10 to lead the way on reforms to protect internet users ' data from government surveillance ' we urge the @entity28 to take the lead and make reforms that ensure that government surveillance efforts are clearly restricted by law , proportionate to the risks , transparent and subject to independent oversight			1
' the letter was also signed by @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107			1
but @entity16 ’s intervention will raise eyebrows , given claims it deliberately harvested information from home computers using its @entity115 cars			1
@entity91 , ceo of @entity14 , said there was ' real need for greater disclosure and new limits on how governments collect information '			1
@entity123 , @entity16 's ceo , said ' the apparent wholesale collection of data , in secret and without independent oversight , by many governments around the world ' had undermined users ' confidence in his company 's ability to safely secure their private information			1
the concerted effort by the big eight internet firms , which together are thought to be worth more than $ 1.4tn , will ratchet up pressure on governments to act			1
it has been estimates that the damage to the industry from spying allegations could hit $ 180bn by 2016 , according to @entity142			1
executive vice president and general counsel of @entity104 , @entity143 told @entity147 's today programme this morning , called for more transparency over government surveillance efforts			1
he said : ‘ i think there 's a high likelihood that more companies will sign on and support these principles in the weeks ahead			0
' we want to live in a world where security is balanced with personal freedom and privacy			0
' for many years governments have managed this responsibility [ investigating criminal activity online ] for specific individuals and groups			0
' it 's very different to collecting information about everyone in case if becomes of interest at a later date			0
' i believe that people in our industry have long been under the impression that government access to data was being governed by the law and due process			2
it was only a month ago [ after a @entity179 expose ] that we learned that more was going on than we were aware of			0
' ' clearly we want government to retain what they need to do in the proper way to keep us all safe but there 's an ample need to strengthen and increase transparency			0
' damage : @entity16 ceo @entity123 , pictured , said internet users ' confidence was seriously undermined by the ' wholesale collection of data , in secret and without independent oversight , by many governments around the world ' @entity193 , executive vice president and general counsel of @entity16 , added : ' strong encryption will go a long way towards ensuring the security and integrity of user data			1
' we want to make sure policy makers and the public know what 's at stake if we do n't get this right			0
' the open letter by the big internet firms has been met with scepticism by some on @entity17			1
one user tweeted : ' come on , after they get caught helping the @entity4 , too little too late ...			0
' while another questioned their credibility , asking : ' are the tech companies sincere ? should citizens trust them after all they have done against freedom ? ' some twitter users wondered if profit not concerns over user privacy had motivated this open letter			2
governments are now facing a groundswell of opinion calling for reforms and limits to surveillance			2
@entity226 , an activist at the @entity227 , told the @entity228 the strength of public outrage over government prying into their private data was now too big an issue to ignore for the internet companies			1
he said : ' it ’s now in their business and economic interest to protect their users ’ privacy and to aggressively push for changes			0
' the @entity4 mass - surveillance programs exist for a simple reason : cooperation with the tech and telecom companies			0
if the tech companies no longer want to cooperate , they have a lot of leverage to force significant reform			0
' @entity253 , director of @entity254 a group which campaigns for civil liberties , said : ' there can be no doubt that the surveillance laws of @entity29 , the @entity28 or countless other countries around the world are not fit for an internet age			0
@entity29 ’s own laws were written before many of these companies even existed			0
' governments should not need to be told by private businesses that it is wrong to collect data on every citizen , through secret processes subject to little or no oversight			1
' sadly that is the position we find ourselves in			0
this statement of principles , by some of the world ’s biggest companies , is a watershed moment and one that can not go ignored in any country that regards itself as a democracy			0
' these businesses represent trillions of dollars of global revenue , highlighting the significant risk to the digital economy of those nations who do not take concerns about web surveillance seriously			0
' last month , former @entity28 intelligence contractor @entity3 , 30 , who fled to @entity292 where he is fighting extradition to the @entity28 on espionage charges , also called for surveillance program reforms			1
in a letter published in @entity298 , he wrote : ' the world has learned a lot in a short amount of time about irresponsibly operated security agencies and , at times , criminal surveillance programs			0
sometimes the agencies try to avoid controls			0
' while the @entity4 and @entity309 ( the @entity29 national security agency ) appear to be the worst offenders - at least according to the documents that are currently public - we can not forget that mass surveillance is a global problem and needs a global solution			0
@entity91 , ceo , @entity14 : ' reports about government surveillance have shown there is a real need for greater disclosure and new limits on how governments collect information			1
the @entity325 should take this opportunity to lead this reform effort and make things right			0
' @entity123 , ceo , @entity16 : ' the security of users ' data is critical , which is why we 've invested so much in encryption and fight for transparency around government requests for information			1
this is undermined by the apparent wholesale collection of data , in secret and without independent oversight , by many governments around the world			1
it 's time for reform and we urge the @entity28 government to lead the way			0
' @entity349 , general counsel , @entity105 : ' these principles embody @entity105 's fundamental commitment to transparency and ensuring appropriate government practices that are respectful of our members ' expectations			2
' @entity143 , general counsel and executive vice president , legal and corporate affairs , @entity104 : ' people wo n't use technology they do n't trust			2
governments have put this trust at risk , and governments need to help restore it			2
' @entity366 , ceo , @entity17 : ' @entity17 is committed to defending and protecting the voice of our users			2
unchecked , undisclosed government surveillance inhibits the free flow of information and restricts their voice			1
the principles we advance today would reform the current system to appropriately balance the needs of security and privacy while safeguarding the essential human right of free expression			0
' @entity383 , ceo , @entity106 : ' protecting the privacy of our users is incredibly important to @entity106			2
recent revelations about government surveillance activities have shaken the trust of our users , and it is time for the @entity28 government to act to restore the confidence of citizens around the world			1
today we join our colleagues in the tech industry calling on the @entity31 to change surveillance laws in order to ensure transparency and accountability for government actions			2
' @entity402 , chairman and ceo , @entity107 : ' @entity107 is committed to preserving the privacy of our customers ' information , while respecting the right of governments to request information on specific users for lawful purposes			1
