' an undated photo of people working inside @entity13 station during its heyday in the @entity1 and @entity2 pictured is @entity127 , located at the top of the @entity129 , which looks down upon the old @entity13 building the centre was built during the @entity1 amid fears the @entity133 could bomb the @entity135 's main communications post at @entity136 , @entity137			1
while @entity13 was still being tested , a fire knocked out the centre at @entity136 , making the @entity3 station @entity135 's foremost naval communications post , sending out orders to our huge fleet of submarines and battleships			1
