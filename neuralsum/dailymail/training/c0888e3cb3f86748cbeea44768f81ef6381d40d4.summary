your day starts at dawn with a cold bath followed by a 90 - minute workout in your own gym			1
afterwards , you 're allowed a low - calorie drink before two hours with your personal hairdresser			1
then , in skin - tight sportswear , you spend the daytime hours exercising			2
your evenings are a whirl of parties at which you 're always the centre of attention , your hair glittering with diamond stars			2
19th century beauty tips : @entity18 tried a goats ' milk bath and veal facial finally , at 2am you crawl into bed , but not before you 've covered your face in ... raw veal			1
it sounds like the insane beauty regime of a @entity28 star			1
in fact , the year is 1875 and this is the beauty routine of @entity31 , @entity32 , who at 38 was dubbed the ' loveliest woman in @entity34			1
' i became fascinated with @entity31 , known as @entity32 , when i visited @entity36 and saw the gym she had built in her bedroom at the @entity39			1
her preoccupation with her appearance was so fascinating it became a major theme in my new book @entity44			2
it is a fictionalised account of the beauty 's scandalous affair with a dashing army captain ten years her junior and shows how the pressure to look perfect was just as acute then as it is today			1
@entity32 , who was appalled by the stoutness of other @entity34 royals of her time like @entity54 @entity53 , was a fitness fanatic and performed 20 pull - ups every morning on gymnastic rings			1
afterwards , she 'd be laced into corsets to achieve a 19in waist , and spent her days riding to hounds or hiking			2
but it 's her beauty regime that makes the mind boggle			1
as well as her veal face - mask , @entity32 bathed in goats ' milk , reduced stomach bloating by drinking five salted egg whites , and washed her admired locks in eggs and cognac			1
day in the life : writer @entity18 , left , followed the @entity32 's beauty regime as she was once dubbed the ' loveliest woman in @entity34 ' she is even said to have slept with her hands tied above her head so the blood drained away , leaving her hands smooth and white			1
bizarre as it sounds , there is no doubt her beauty regime worked			1
when she died , aged 60 in 1898 , stabbed to the heart by an @entity82 anarchist , she still had that tiny waist , despite having four children			2
photographs of her - in her 40s and 50s - show she was still astonishingly beautiful			2
her marriage to the @entity89 was not happy , but she remained irresistible to men of all ages			2
the more i wrote about @entity32 , the more i wondered how her beauty regime would work for a modern middle - aged mother of two			1
there was only one way to find out ... after the 5am bath of cold water , @entity32 would have a brisk massage to get her circulation going and her complexion glowing			1
getting up this early was grim - my days usually start at 7am with three cups of tea and a hot shower			2
but the early start was nothing compared to the ice - cold bath			2
my shrieks on hitting the water might have woken up the house but my skin glowed , my eye bags shrank and i felt alive			2
i could n't find a masseuse willing to take me on at 5.30 am but gave myself an extremely vigorous rub down with a towel instead			2
fitness fanatic : @entity32 worked out to stay slim then was laced into corsets to achieve a 19in waist i do n't have gymnastic rings at home so i went to a local gym to follow @entity32 's regime of pull - ups and dumbbell exercises with my personal trainer			1
although i cycle everywhere and exercise twice a week , it was a struggle			2
i could do the leg stretches and dumbbell lifts - just - but i could manage just one pull - up , and that was only to chin level , before collapsing			2
@entity32 's upper - body strength was clearly phenomenal			1
perhaps riding horses might be easier			2
i learnt as a child , so i went for a ride in @entity137			2
after an hour - and - a - half of trotting and cantering i was feeling muscles in places i did n't even know i had			0
judging by my aches the next day , @entity32 's inner thighs must have been made of iron			1
there 's no way i could have spent all day galloping to hounds like she did			0
as it was , when my riding session finished i felt like i had been in a spin dryer			0
and apart from a few gulps of beef tea after her morning exercise , @entity32 consumed nothing else during the day apart from a dry biscuit or two ( i improvised with an @entity155 cube and @entity156 )			1
crowning glory : she bathed her hair in eggs and cognac to keep it lustrous thick , glossy locks then , as now , were hugely prized			0
we think the @entity164 's mane as a crowning glory , but @entity32 's was far more impressive			1
her hairdresser , @entity166 , toiled for two hours each morning to turn her ankle - length chestnut tresses into a crown of plaits			0
washing her locks took a whole day , once a fortnight			0
the baroness used a mix of a dozen eggs and a bottle of cognac to keep her mistress 's locks lustrous ; the eggs for moisture and body , the cognac for shine			0
i tried washing my hair with @entity32 's unorthodox shampoo			1
i used two eggs whisked with an inch of brandy and left it in my hair for ten minutes			0
it smelt delicious - like eggnog - but even after i rinsed it out , my hair felt sticky and the aroma of @entity194 followed me around			0
my husband kept asking : ' have you been drinking ? this one was intended to revive @entity32 after a day in the saddle			1
to keep the skin on her body soft , the @entity32 bathed in goats ' milk , and she used to travel with a herd of goats to this end			1
or if she had had a hard day ’s hunting she would bathe in hot olive oil to soothe her aching muscles			0
finding enough goats ' milk to fill my bath was quite a challenge , as , unlike @entity32 , i do n't have my own personal flock			1
it took runs to several supermarkets to get enough to cover my all - too - ample flesh - i used about ten gallons topped up with hot water			0
while i would n't do this on a regular basis ( it cost about £ 25 ) , the skin on my legs and arms has never been softer			0
this is probably because the enzymes in the goats ' milk tenderise the dry skin			0
i certainly did n't need any body lotion afterwards and my impressed husband said my legs looked and felt super smooth			0
cleaning the greasy , tangy bath afterwards was hell ( not a problem that an empress has to think about )			0
i did n’t bother with the olive oil as by my calculation to fill my bath would have cost me nearly £ 800 ! @entity32 would sleep with warm , damp cloths knotted round her waist because this was thought to shrink it			1
i heated damp towels in the microwave to do the same , then wrapped myself in silver foil to keep the heat in and to stop my bed from getting soaking wet			0
it was n't particularly comfortable and i do n't think my waist shrank overnight , but perhaps it needs to be done regularly			0
when she felt bloated , @entity32 would drink five egg whites mixed with salt			1
i think it was meant to clear out her digestive system			0
just before going to sleep , i drank the concoction - the single most disgusting thing that has ever passed my lips			0
i had to have a slug of the hair - washing brandy to keep me from throwing up			0
my stomach did look a bit flatter afterwards , but that may have been because the mixture put me off proper food for days			0
@entity18 has written a novel based on @entity32 's life @entity32 was extremely concerned about the texture of her skin as she spent most of her days hunting			1
this meaty face pack was thought to repair the ravages of too much exposure to the sun , wind and rain			0
over the veal , she wore a leather mask so she could sleep with it on ( presumably to keep her three wolf hounds from nibbling at it )			0
when i asked my butcher for really thin slices of the meat he asked me what i was using it for			0
i think he is still laughing at my answer , especially as the humanely - reared veal escalopes cost about £ 20 for the lot			0
the veal felt quite soothing on my skin ( i kept mine in place with cling film instead of a leather mask ) and it smelt no worse than some face creams			0
it was n't even uncomfortable to sleep in , or perhaps that 's because i was exhausted from all the exercise			0
and my skin did look soft and pink the next morning			0
how much of that was dried veal juices i really ca n't say , although my skin was definitely dewier			0
but my pillows were a bit worse for wear from the juice that escaped and my husband decided to sleep on the sofa			0
after a day and night of @entity32 's beauty ritual i can quite understand why she looked so good - but also why her marriage was so unhappy			1
the @entity89 ca n't have enjoyed living with a woman who spent her entire day making herself beautiful for other men but not for him			1
and who wants to sleep next to a woman wearing a @entity312 mask and smelling of goats ' milk and dripping blood , even if her skin is really soft ? the @entity44 , by @entity317 , is published by @entity318 , and is out now			1

@entity31 , @entity32 , was dubbed the ' loveliest woman in @entity34 '
she endured punishing beauty and fitness regime
could her 19th century *techniques* work today ?
