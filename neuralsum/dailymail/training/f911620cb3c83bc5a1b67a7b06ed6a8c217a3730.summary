by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 02:59 est , 27 july 2012 updated : 13:13 est , 27 july 2012 the high - speed ' javelin ' train designed to whisk @entity5 visitors to @entity6 had a false start on the opening day of the @entity5 when this morning 's first official train departed late because a driver failed to turn up for work			1
the @entity13 train company had designated the 7.04am from @entity14 in @entity15 to the @entity16 in @entity6 as the beginning of the service			1
but the 140mph @entity20 - built train did not leave @entity6 until 7.09am , as travel bosses were forced to delay the train while it waited for a replacement driver , as the scheduled worker had called in sick			1
left waiting : @entity5 volunteers and @entity5 visitors wait to board the delayed @entity13 train this morning , on its first day whisking people to @entity6 officials said the delay was caused by a driver who did not turn up at work due to illness the train , pictured this morning , will eventually ferry 25,000 people per hour to and from the @entity16 one of those on the delayed train today was a chef working in a hospitality area at the @entity16			1
he has been travelling to @entity6 from @entity42 via @entity14 for the past few days			1
he said today : ' not one of my trains has been on time			0
it was 15 minutes late one day			2
' once under way , today ’s delayed 7.04am service raced to @entity50 in east @entity15 in less than seven minutes			0
there were also travel problems in and around east @entity15 on the day of the @entity53 , as tube lines and mainline services were delayed			1
@entity56 quick : once working , the 140mph javelin trains will whisk @entity5 visitors from @entity14 ( pictured ) to @entity6 in just seven minutes one of the hold - ups was at @entity60 where the @entity5 ’ gymnastics and basketball is being held			1
the @entity60 problem was a signal failure on the jubilee line - just two stops from the main @entity5 station at @entity6			1
those heading to @entity15 from @entity69 were delayed by a broken - down train at @entity71 in @entity72			2
this caused hold - ups for @entity76 train company services into @entity15 ’s @entity77			2
fast travel : the @entity13 train is designed to whisk @entity5 visitors from @entity14 directly to the @entity16 meanwhile , @entity5 fans heading for @entity15 on the @entity82 hit noontime gridlock and delays of nearly 2 hours after a multi-vehicle smash involving an overturned lorry today			1
black - cab @entity15 taxi drivers staged an hour long go - slow protest at @entity89 in central @entity15 over @entity5 traffic lanes			1
traffic was at a standstill for about 50 minutes from 2.50pm when police cleared the area , said @entity95			0
this in turn led to congestion on all approaches to @entity89 at @entity100			0
the demonstration came hours before thousands of spectators and world leaders were expected to attend the opening ceremony of the @entity105			0
cabbies have held two protests over being barred from 30 miles of ‘ @entity108 ‘ reserved for @entity110 officials and athletes			0
they argue that they are an intrinsic part of @entity15 ’s public transport system and should be allowed access to the lanes			2
but their views have fallen on deaf @entity5 ears			2
@entity120 , vice chairman of @entity121 , had said : ' we do n't want to disrupt @entity123 , what we want to do is to bring to the public 's attention the plight of the @entity15 cab driver who is unable to bring a service to the @entity5 during the @entity5			2
' @entity130 said cabs were able to use some lanes to collect fares			0
three lanes northbound and two southbound were closed between junction 16 west of @entity136 and junction 18 east of @entity138			0
eight @entity13 trains an hour will run between @entity14 and @entity6 and @entity141 in @entity142 during the @entity110			1
between 11pm and 1.59am there will be 12 trains an hour , with a half - hourly shuttle between @entity6 and @entity14 between 2am and 5am			1
the service will run until sunday august 12 and will operate for the @entity147 from wednesday august 29 to sunday september 9			0
@entity13 expects to transport 25,000 people an hour to and from @entity6			1
those with @entity5 ’ travelcards can use them on the @entity13 service			2
a spokesman for @entity13 said the 7.04am had left late because the company had to get a replacement driver , as the booked driver was unwell			1
she went on : ' we have drivers on standby for this reason ; 99 % of our trains arrived on time this morning			0
' @entity159 and the @entity160 ( @entity160 ) said a total of nearly 444,000 extra main line train seats were being provided today			0
in all , four million seats were on offer , thanks to the running of extra services and longer trains			0
@entity159 said that at noon , 92 per cent of services were running to schedule across the network – though that still means about 1 in 12 were late			0
late - night trains will run after tonight 's opening ceremony			0
for example , the last train from @entity174 to @entity175 leaves at 2.17am and the last from @entity177 to @entity178 at 2.30am .			0

140mph train left late on first day due to staff issue
@entity184 will transport 25,000 people per hour to and from @entity6
