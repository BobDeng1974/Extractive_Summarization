@entity0 has filed a patent that could let users unlock their smartphones and tablets using facial expressions rather than typing in passwords			1
the latest @entity8 devices already have a built - in @entity10 feature that uses facial recognition to unlock their handsets , but this patent would take the technology a step further adding additional ' liveness ' features			1
when @entity0 launched @entity10 in 2011 , as part of @entity19 , it was criticised by security experts because it could be bypassed by holding static photos up to the phone or tablet 's camera			1
if a patent filed by @entity0 is approved , it could mean users would be able to unlock their smartphones by pulling faces such as frowning , smiling , poking out their tongue , wrinkling their nose , blinking and so on			1
the technology would compare the facial expression pulled with a previously captured photo and if the expressions matched , the user would be allowed access to their device in the update to @entity42 in july 2012 , @entity0 added a ' liveness ' check in an attempt to prevent these static images being used to gain access to devices			1
this meant a user would have to blink while using @entity10 to prove they were alive			2
however , even this could be bypassed using clever photo editing tricks			0
according to @entity0 's latest @entity55 patent , the new system would require users to pull a specific , predeterminded facial expression			1
to get access to a device the user would have to pull a specific predeterminded facial expression			1
the expression would then be scanned and compared to a previously captured photo to confirm the user 's identity			0
facial expressions listed include blinking , frowning , smiling , sticking out a tongue , wrinkling a nose and raising an eyebrow			1
the patent explains there would be a small margin of error but the user 's expression would have to match the original photo as closely as possible			1
the technology would then check for ' liveness ' - a signal that shows the user is alive and moving and not a static image			1
it would scan for changes in pixels and light to monitor and recognise the changes in the location of the facial features			1
for example , if a blink is used to gain access the technology would record the light from the eye and then monitor if this light changes , suggesting the eye has been closed			1
this ' live ' movement is then given a score based on how similar it is to the original image			0
if the score reaches the minimum security threshold , the phone is unlocked			0
if it does n't the user is denied access and has to try again			0
the expression would then be scanned and compared to a previously captured photo to confirm the user 's identity			0
the patent said : ' the anti-spoofing techniques herein may use facial gestures such as blinks , winks , and other gestures that may be performed within the confines of a human face			1
' [ the device ] may detect facial gestures associated with various facial features			1
examples include one or both eyes ( e.g. , for blinks , winks , etc. ) , the mouth area ( e.g. , for gestures including smiling , frowning , displaying a user 's teeth , extending a user 's tongue , etc. ) , the nose ( e.g. , for a nose wrinkle gesture , etc. ) , the forehead ( e.g. , for a forehead wrinkle gesture , etc. ) , one or both eyebrows ( for eyebrow raise and compression gestures , etc. ) , and various others			1
' @entity0 already lets its users enable two - step verification for their online accounts , and offers face unlock on @entity8			1
with @entity10 , pictured , @entity8 users can use their face to unlock their smartphone or tablet , in place of a pin or a pattern the patent explains there would be a small margin of error but the user 's expression would have to match the original photo as closely as possible			1
a chart in the patent shows that the technology would capture the first facial image and compare it to the photo on file			1
it would then check for ' liveness '			0
according to the patent : ' in the example of the blink gesture , corresponding pixel locations of the first and second sub-images may represent portions of the corneas and the eyelids , respectively			1
' additionally , the eyelids may include less pixel transitions than the corneas			0
' more specifically , a cornea may display pixel transitions ( e.g. , contrasting colors ) with respect to two or more of the sclera , iris , and pupil			0
images in the @entity0 's patent , pictured , filed to the @entity181 , show that the technology scans the eyes and other features for changes in pixels and light fluctuations			1
these changes can be used to track movement			0
if the changes caused by the facial expression do n't match the photo on file the user will be denied access to their device ' conversely , an eyelid may display pixel transitions only at its upper bound ( relative to the eyebrow ) and lower bound ( relative to the eyelash )			2
' this means the device would check for the location of light and pixels relative to a person 's face and their facial features			2
if a blink is used to gain access , for example , the technology would record the light from the eye and then monitor if this light changes , suggesting the eye had been closed			2
@entity0 added a ' liveness ' check feature to @entity42			1
this means users have to blink when using @entity219 to prove they are not a photo in order to get access to their device this ' live ' movement is then given a score based on how similar it is to the original image			0
if the score reaches the minimum security threshold , the phone is unlocked			0
if it does n't the user is denied access and has to try again			0
the patent does n't explain how many times a user can try to access the device before it is permanently locked , not does it say if there is a failsafe technique if the user ca n't get in			2
the patent is still waiting for approval and @entity0 declined to comment on the plans , including when its likely to be available if it gets approval			1
@entity244 announced in may it was also looking at alternatives to the traditional passwords using physical authentication			2
among the ideas discussed at the @entity250 conference in @entity251 were electronic tattoos and pills that people swallow			2
the tattoos , developed by @entity257 - based engineering firm @entity256 , contain flexible electronic circuits that are attached to the wearer 's skin using a rubber stamp			0
@entity244 claimed that the circuits , which also contain antennae and built - in sensors , could be adapted to work with mobile phones and tablets			2
this image shows the various parts that make up the @entity256 electronic tattoo called the @entity270			0
it can be stuck to the body using a rubber stamp , and protected using spray - on bandages			0
the circuit can be worn for two weeks and @entity244 believes this makes it perfect for authentication purposes the mobile devices could then be used to confirm the owner 's identity and log them in to accounts automatically			2
another idea presented during the keynote talk at the @entity285 conference with head of @entity244 @entity287 and senior vice president for advanced technology and products , @entity288 , was a swallowable pill			2
the @entity292 pill has already been approved by the @entity55 @entity293 and was given @entity295 regulatory approval in 2010			0
it contains a computer chip that can be powered like a battery using the acid in the wearer 's stomach			0
once swallowed the ' vitamin authentication pill ' creates an 18 - bit @entity304 - like signal inside the wearer 's body that can be picked up by mobile devices and authentication hardware outside			0
this could be used verify the wearer is the correct owner of the device or account			2
a similar idea teased by @entity244 during talk last year was a swallowable pill ( picutred )			0
it contains a computer chip powered like a battery using the acid in the wearer 's stomach			0
once swallowed the ' vitamin authentication pill ' creates an 18 - bit @entity304 - like signal that can be picked up by mobile devices			0

@entity0 has filed a patent that could let phones recognise its owner using facial expressions
the technology can register blinks , frowns , wrinkled noses and smiles
it has been filed to stop people being able to bypass facial recognition passwords using photos
