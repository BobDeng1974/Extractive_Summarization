i watched it again and it looked far worse than it was			2
@entity3 was a split second from kicking the ball , there was n't any malice			1
' the players around did n't help with their reaction			0
@entity3 did n't deserve that			1
' @entity6 boss @entity70 disagreed			0
' having watched it again , the lad was reckless , ' he said			0

you would 've got away with it in my day			0
now when you make a tackle you have to be more careful			0
the referee was on the spot			0
he sees it better than us on touchline			0
' @entity0 started five players signed this month and though they were initially playing like a side who barely knew each other managed to carve out the best chances			1
@entity35 headed a long ball down to @entity34 who hit a first - time drive bouncing towards the bottom right corner but inches wide of the post in the first half			2
then in the second debutant @entity26 , on loan from @entity97 , powered a header on target from @entity30 ' free kick and @entity6 goalkeeper @entity42 was at full stretch to push it over			2
the first 20 minutes were starved of chances until @entity6 took the initiative			0
substitute @entity106 ( right ) blocks a powerful shot from @entity6 's @entity108 - @entity49 @entity6 's @entity51 ( left ) skips past @entity1 defender @entity27 during the @entity110 clash @entity46 sent in a corner from the right towards the near post on 22 minutes and @entity114 got to the ball first but his header was weak and caught by @entity1 goalkeeper @entity24			1
four minutes later @entity46 struck an effort from all of 30 yards which bounced awkwardly in front of @entity24 who got his body behind the ball			0
on the half - hour @entity32 finally carved out a first chance for @entity1 , wriggling between four @entity6 players inside their penalty area before digging out a cross from the left touchline , only for @entity42 to leap from his line to cut the ball out			1
a game of vague chances suddenly flared up a minute before the break , but not for the right reasons as @entity3 dived in on @entity12			2
@entity1 goalkeeper @entity24 comes out to claim the ball as @entity50 ( left ) chases it down emotions from the sending off extended into the second half and increased the intensity as the sides traded blows			1
a minute after kick off , @entity6 's @entity45 struck a shot into the ground after making a late run to the back post but it was beaten out by @entity24 , who then kept out @entity143 ' follow - up from distance			2
then @entity34 made a dart to the near post and powered a header that had @entity42 scrambling but fell , again , narrowly the wrong side of the post			0
@entity6 took advantage of their extra man from then on , dominating possession but failing to turn it into a goal			0
