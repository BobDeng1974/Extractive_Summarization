by @entity0 @entity1 died at home because her symptoms were not taken seriously by paramedics a dental nurse died after ' serious failings ' by paramedics called to her home , a coroner ruled today			1
@entity1 , 30 , was found dead just six hours after ambulancemen told her she did n't need to go to hospital , despite being ' barely conscious '			1
an inquest heard she would have survived if she had been taken to hospital - and been given simple injections			1
her father , @entity15 , told the hearing he was with her when she was examined by paramedics @entity17 and @entity19			2
' @entity1 looked very distressed and could hardly speak - she was conscious but was not with it totally , ' he said			1
' there was a discussion about hospitals , but the paramedics said : " you are better off here @entity1 , this is the best place for you " , ' he added			1
' we were persuaded in their arguments that she was in the best place and she did not need to be sitting in an ambulance			0
we accepted the situation as it was			0
' the inquest heard the paramedics left @entity1 's home in @entity36 at 1.40am on 5 may 2007			1
she was found dead in the bathroom at 7.30am			0
the inquest in @entity39 , @entity40 , heard @entity1 was battling the after - effects of a brain tumour when an ambulance was called			2
coroner @entity44 said there was conflicting evidence by the paramedics and @entity1 's parents @entity15 and @entity49			2
he said : ' there were serious failings in the way in which the crew went about their assessment and recording her condition that night			0
' these included an inappropriate method used to assess respiratory rate , no attempt to listen to @entity1 's chest with a stethoscope and no assessment of her abdomen			0
' the blood pressure is likely to have been inaccurate and there was a failure to get details of the long - term medication @entity1 was taking			0
guilty : the inquest found that paramedics were responsible for @entity1 's death ' if @entity1 had been taken to hospital it was likely she would have received intravenous hydrocortisone injections and fluids , and her death would not have occurred			1
' ' but given the crew 's lack of knowledge and the rarity of @entity1 's condition , this can not be labelled as gross failings			0
' a @entity86 spokesman said : ' we will be giving full and urgent consideration to the coroner 's narrative verdict to ensure that all opportunities are taken to continuously improve our service			0

@entity1 , 30 , was barely conscious when paramedics arrived
they told her she was ' better off ' at home rather than hospital
inquest ruled she would have survived had she received simple treatment
