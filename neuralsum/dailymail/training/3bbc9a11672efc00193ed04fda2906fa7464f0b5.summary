by @entity0 a school at the centre of the @entity4 ‘ @entity5 ’ takeover plot has refused to accept the findings of an @entity8 report that claimed it is failing to do enough to protect children from extremism			1
the report - made public yesterday but leaked to the @entity12 on monday - revealed @entity13 , in @entity14 , was doing ' too little to keep students safe from the risks associated with extremist views '			2
it was placed in special measures after @entity8 noted ‘ staff views are polarised ’ about leadership and that sex and relationships education was not taught properly			1
denial : @entity13 ( pictured ) has refused to accept the findings of an @entity8 report that claimed it is failing to do enough to protect children from extremism			1
the charges were rejected as politically motivated the charges have been rejected by the school ’s management as being politically motivated			1
a statement from the school said it disputed the validity of the inspection			0
@entity13 secondary school in @entity36 is one of three managed by the @entity38 - all of which are believed to have been rated inadequate			2
a @entity38 spokesman said @entity8 found no evidence that @entity13 either promoted or tolerated extremism or radicalisation			1
it added it did not accept @entity8 findings that the school was inadequate			1
’ it said : ' @entity48 does not accept the findings of the @entity8 report , which mischaracterises the school , and is now challenging it through the appropriate legal channels			1
' @entity13 was one of 21 schools inspected after a letter - now widely believed to be a hoax - referred to an alleged plot by hard - line @entity58 to seize control of governing boards in the city , dubbed @entity63			2
the @entity5 letter , which was unsigned , undated and first sent to council officials and teaching unions late last year , has sparked several separate investigations including by @entity69 , @entity70 , the @entity71 and @entity8			1
in its statement , @entity38 , said it believed that the inspections had been conducted ' in a climate of fear created by the ' @entity5 ' letter '			2
controversy : @entity78 , which is at the centre of the @entity5 plot allegations , has been accused of segregating women and children during lessons inspectors who visited @entity13 concluded that the school was not doing enough to raise students ' awareness of ' risks of extremism ' , according to @entity38 's statement			1
but the @entity38 said it was crucial to note that @entity8 's report contained no suggestion , or evidence , that the school either promotes or tolerates extremism or radicalisation			1
it added that it disputed the inspectorate 's finding that there had been slow progress in ensuring that staff had been trained in recognising the signs of radicalisation and how to tailor their teaching to counter this			0
and it claimed a finding that students are not being properly prepared for life in modern @entity111 was a ' misrepresentation '			2
it said : ' on behalf of the staff , students and parents who have worked so hard to improve their school , we are extremely disappointed to confirm that @entity8 has decided to place @entity13 in special measures			1
' education : @entity120 has been accused of ' sitting on ' warnings of @entity5 plots since 2010 ' while we support the role of @entity8 in holding schools to account in a fair and transparent way , we wholeheartedly dispute the validity of these gradings			1
@entity13 is categorically not an inadequate school			2
it is also crucial to note that the school had been part of @entity38 for just five months at the time of the @entity8 inspection in march 2014			2
' a number of the judgments are based on data and information that pre-date the @entity38 's involvement			0
' @entity38 runs three schools , including @entity141 which has been at the centre of some of the most serious allegations			0
in the past , @entity38 chairman @entity145 has called the allegations ' a witch - hunt			0
' earlier this week , it was revealed that three other schools inspected by @entity8 had been given a clean bill of health			0
the @entity14 - based schools published letters received from the watchdog which all found governance and leadership to be either good or outstanding - the highest rating available - and concluding that child - safeguarding standards were being met			0
@entity159 - an academy in @entity161 - @entity160 and @entity162 were the first to publish the results of their inspections , after education secretary @entity120 sent @entity8 in over the @entity5 allegations			1
a separate over-arching report by the head of @entity8 and chief inspector of schools sir @entity169 is expected to be published next week , along with any remaining @entity8 reports for the individual schools concerned			0
@entity174 education secretary @entity173 said : ' gender discrimination , undue influence of extremist views , the school curriculum influenced by hard - line beliefs			0
this report confirms that @entity120 can no longer seek to distance himself from this episode			0
' ' in 2010 , @entity120 was warned by a highly respected @entity14 headteacher that this was going on			0
four years on , he has failed to act and has not explained why			0
' ' rightly , his record is now being called into question			0
rather than rowing with @entity186 , he needs to answer why he has refused to act			0

@entity13 school refused to accept ' extremism ' claims made by @entity8
education watchdog accused the school of failing to protect its pupils
also claimed sex and relationship education is not being taught properly
@entity78 rejected the accusations , saying findings are politically motivated
@entity13 is at centre of @entity4 ' @entity5 ' takeover plot allegations
