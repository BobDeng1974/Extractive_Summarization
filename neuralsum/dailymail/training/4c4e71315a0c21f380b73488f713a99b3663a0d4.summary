for around £ 320 ( € 400 ) guests can take in the stunning , panoramic views of the runway from the cosy converted cockpit as well as enjoy the privacy of their own en - suite bathroom			1
but that is n't all , visitors can also kick back in the communal lounge in restored arm chairs or sip from martini glasses in the comfortable on board bar			0

the hotel is located just 65ft from the airport , next to the taxi runway that planes currently use owner and investor @entity17 says that guests are often amazed when they set foot in the hotel with bunk beds in some rooms , the cleverly - designed plane uses the most of its limited space , as seen in this artist 's rendering second life : the plane was once part of the @entity29 fleet and flew all over the world between 1984 and 1991 though the plane has served its time in the skies , owner @entity17 says it 's now ' resting and guarding ' its new guests ' i would say the best part of the hotel is the view from the cockpits window			1
