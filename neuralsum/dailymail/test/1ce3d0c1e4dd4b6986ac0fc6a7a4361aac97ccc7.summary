@entity0 has urged @entity1 to think the unthinkable — and consider a move from @entity3 to @entity4			1
@entity6 ’s puppeteer , who still pulls virtually every string in the paddock at the age of 84 , was speaking after calling @entity1 in for talks at his office in @entity12			1
@entity1 , 30 , has yet to put pen to paper on a new contract with @entity3			1
he says that only small details need finalising , but until the ink is dry there are no guarantees he will stay			0
@entity6 supremo @entity0 with @entity1 in @entity12 @entity21 got the better of @entity3 team - mate @entity1 in @entity12 second practice @entity21 was slower in sectors one and two of @entity26 but a mistake from @entity1 gifted him first place @entity1 takes a corner in @entity30 , @entity12 ahead of @entity4 driver @entity31 that leaves the door ajar for @entity1 to team up with @entity31 at @entity4 to settle which of the pair , who hold six world titles between them , is the better driver			1
‘ it would be great to see @entity1 at @entity4 , ’ said @entity0 ahead of practice for sunday 's @entity40			1
‘ @entity42 would want that , i really do n’t know			0
but if @entity1 went there , it would be great for the sport — 100 per cent			2
’ every racer dreams of driving the red car of @entity4 and , given their improvement in pace this season , they are an attractive proposition			2
@entity1 is helped given the fact that @entity4 president @entity55 has admitted privately that he covets the @entity56 , rating him as the star driver of his generation			1
another team principal suggested @entity4 might approach @entity1 ’s camp out of mischief to unsettle @entity3 , who remain confident that only legal formalities are delaying them closing the deal			1
it also remains to be seen if @entity31 would veto a move for @entity1			1
it is understood that a clause in his contract would allow the @entity70 to do so			2
for now @entity1 is putting his contract negotiations to one side in an attempt to extend his 13 - point lead over @entity31 in the drivers ’ championship			1
he won a titanic battle at the front in a memorable race here at @entity12 ’s @entity81 last year against @entity3 team - mate @entity21			1
@entity1 ’s confidence is high , a result of being in the form of his life			2
‘ i ’ve almost surprised myself , ’ he said			0
‘ i have been strong and built on last year			2
i have been adapting to things well			0
@entity1 suffered a lock - up in the second sector of the @entity89 , leaving him in second sparks fly from the rear end of @entity93 's @entity3 during a practice session in @entity12 ‘ winning a second title gives you an extra hop in your walk			1
i ’m enjoying the feeling of the hard work i , and my team , have put in			2
’ the problem for @entity21 is how to stop a rival who is so confident			0
he did not manage it in @entity105 last week , where the pair rowed over how each conducted his race			0
did the bust - up rattle @entity1 ? ‘ i just try and laugh it off and let it go over my head , ’ he said			2
‘ it ’s irrelevant to the race result			0
i ’m not one to arrive here and think , “ i ’ve got the upper hand ; just keep going ”			0
‘ i feel very strong in my understanding of the car and what i need to get from the tyres			0
my race craft is still there , race pace is good , and then qualifying has picked up a little bit			0
that has been a focus for improvement			0
‘ but even in the last qualifying session my final lap in @entity129 was not perfect , so i ’ve still got to improve that			0
‘ overall i feel that if i remove the power of somebody else to give me confidence or take my confidence away , then i ’m never affected			0
’ @entity31 had issues throughout the day , eventually finishing the second practice in fourth place @entity31 finished fourth , behind @entity21 , @entity1 and third - placed @entity139 in @entity12			1

@entity0 has urged @entity1 to consider a move to @entity4
the 30 - year - old has yet to put pen to paper on new contract with @entity3
the @entity56 will seek to to extend his 13 - point lead at the @entity12 @entity40
