during the two - hour trip , the strangers talked endlessly and exchanged contact details to meet again and the rest , as they say , is history			0

staff members , @entity33 and @entity34 , start the string of touching messages with @entity34 saying : ' who would ’ve thought all of those years ago when you sat in row 4 as complete strangers that it was meant to be – have a great day			1
' then the video goes into the cockpit of the plane with captain @entity64 who was joined by officer @entity66			0
' we hope the fastened seat belt is n’t switched on or too often for any turbulence throughout your relationship – we wish you a smooth and enjoyable ride , ' officer @entity66 said			0
baggage handlers , @entity76 and @entity77 , gave their own piece of advice : ' whilst we deal with baggage every day - to avoid that baggage make sure you clearly communicate to one another and have a fantastic and loving and long marriage			0

' everyone at the reception cheered and applauded			0
' even though mr white had discussed the video with @entity12 in the week and a half leading up to the wedding , he did no expect great footage , ' we were really impressed by the extra distance mile that @entity22 had gone to , especially as it started out as a reasonably small request for a congratulation letter to read out at the reception , ' he said			1
' when we watched it we knew that everyone would love it			0
' during the two - hour trip , the strangers talked endlessly and exchanged contact details to meet again the couple could never have known stepping onto that plane all those years ago - when @entity8 was jetting off to visit her parents while @entity9 was heading to a family wedding - that their lives would be changed forever			1

' she could not stop telling us about the great guy she had met on the flight , ' he said			2
the couple 's starkly different personalities made them a compatible match			2
