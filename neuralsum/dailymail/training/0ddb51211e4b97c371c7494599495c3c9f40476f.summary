it happens almost every time an airline employee announces that a plane is ready for boarding – anxious passengers queue at the gate , only to face a torturous wait while the plane is loaded from back to front			2
making matters worse , some passengers try to jump the queue while those on board battle for space in the overhead storage locker			0
for those who are convinced there is a faster and more efficient method , a test by the popular @entity19 television series @entity20 appears to back up that theory			1
using a custom - built replica of a 173 - seat aircraft interior , it took 24 minutes and 29 seconds before all of the volunteer passengers were in their seats with the back - to - front method			1
it turns out the fastest method involved no assigned seating			1
with a time of 14 minutes and seven seconds , business class boarded first and then all other passengers chose their seats at random as they stepped onto the aircraft			0
even though it was the fastest method , it had the worst passenger satisfaction rating			1
the traditional back - to - front boarding method used by most airlines was the slowest and least efficient the reverse pyramid method had the highest customer satisfaction rating			1
passengers in economy boarded the plane from back to front and outside in			0
it was the third fastest technique with a time of 15 minutes and 10 seconds			0
with a time of 14 minutes and 55 seconds , the @entity63 method ( window seats first , followed by middle seats and aisle seats ) was the second fastest technique			2
a combination of the @entity63 method and zones – the fourth fastest scenario – filled the plane in 15 minutes and seven seconds , while the fifth fastest was a free - for - all with assigned seating ( 17 minutes and 15 seconds )			1
@entity20 hosts @entity75 ( left ) and @entity76 tested six different plane boarding methods professional cabin crew directed passengers to their seats and assisted with hand luggage that had to be placed in overhead lockers or checked because it was too large			2
five per cent of the volunteers were given tasks to slow down the process to simulate an actual boarding experience			0
the tasks included sitting in the wrong seat , taking an excruciatingly long time to fold a coat or carrying a small child .			0

hosts of the popular @entity19 television series tested six methods
traditional back to front method was the slowest at more than 24 minutes
fastest method involved no assigned seating but was least popular
