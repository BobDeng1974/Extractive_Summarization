by @entity0 this waxwork museum in @entity2 offers people the chance to get closer to their idols , but any fans visiting the exhibition may struggle to recognise who they 're looking at			1
the collection in @entity10 claims to be @entity2 's answer to @entity12 , but may leave visitors feeling a bit baffled , and more than a little creeped out			1
the museum boasts models of @entity17 , who looks like she may be having problems with her slightly bendy arms , alongside a distinctly @entity21 - looking @entity20			0
however visitor may struggle to know who they 're looking at ( pictured @entity28 as mr @entity29 ) @entity30 : without the iphone in his hand , tech fans may not have recognised this as former @entity36 ceo @entity20 a very surprised @entity28 also appears wearing his mr @entity29 attire , while another @entity39 actor to make the collection is @entity41 , in full @entity43 robes			1
@entity44 also takes a star turn in the collection , complete with the little black dress and gloves she wore in @entity48 , though looking slightly less - than glamorous with a slanted tiara and join - line where her head meets her torso			0
another figurine looks vaguely like @entity54 , with his signature swept - back hair and goatee			1
wolf in sheep 's clothing : this model is supposed to be of @entity61 actor @entity54 model @entity17 appears to be having some problem with her arms as they stick out at an impossible angle aside from celebrities , world leaders @entity68 and @entity69 are also on show			1
while the former appears relaxed , with his arms sort - of crossed , the latter wears a mildly - confused expression , appears to be pouring sweat and has a thinning hairline			0
both political heavyweights also appear to have developed a slightly cross-eyed stare			0
@entity81 : this unconvincing waxwork of @entity44 is let down even further by the join - line between her neck and torso and is nothing compared to the original you 're not a wizard : @entity41 as @entity43 would be almost unrecognisable if not for the clothes completing the collection is an @entity93 - inspired @entity92 dressed up in a terminator - style leather jacket , though his frizzy locks are pretty unconvincing			2
the @entity10 waxworks will thankfully be open free of charge throughout may			2
however , it may struggle to take the title of @entity102 's worst waxworks away from the @entity39 's @entity103 in @entity104 , which was bought earlier this year by an anonymous bidder in the @entity106			0
not - so - heavyweight : political bigwig @entity68 is slightly cross-eyed as a mannequin , as is his counterpart @entity69 , who is also sporting a thinning hairline			0

waxwork exhibition is being put on in museum in @entity10 , @entity2
collection features likes of @entity28 and @entity54
however fans may struggle to recognise their celebrity idols
