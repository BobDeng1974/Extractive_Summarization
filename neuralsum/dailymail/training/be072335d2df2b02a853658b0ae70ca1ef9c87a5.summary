@entity1 manufacturers have been accused of creating a ' health halo ' around their products to mislead consumers about the fruit and vegetable content			1
researchers have found packaged foods are routinely fudging fruit and vegetable claims on labels which has prompted the call for the government to crack down on the practice by bringing the claims within the scope of the food standards code			1
the @entity19 and @entity20 researchers found one third of the products failed a basis nutrition test after scouring the shelves for days in the country 's five largest supermarkets - @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 ( now iga as well )			1
@entity34 ( right ) have 99.7 per cent fruit , but both products contain none of the fibre of real fruit because they are made of ' concentrated puree ' or ' concentrated juice ' there is only 13 % fruit juice in this product , and the second ingredient is sugar - per serve it has nearly 14 teaspoons of sugar the poetic licence taken by manufacturers stems from there not being a required limit on fruit and vegetable claims because they refer to ingredients rather than specific nutrients			1
out of about 760 labels from juices , soups and snacks that the researchers photographed by the researchers and half displayed a fruit or vegetable claim			1
about one - third failed a basic nutrition test based on sugar , salt and fat levels and many were found to lack the vitamins , minerals and fibre of genuine fruit and vegetables			1
one brand of fruit bar , @entity34 , claims to have one serve of fruit a serve , was 18 grams - short of the 30 grams defined as a dried fruit serve			2
@entity83 's @entity82 , a fruit juice ' made with real - life raspberries ' , contained 13 per cent fruit juice and 14 teaspoons of sugar			1
co-author @entity88 , of @entity19 , said food companies were cashing in on the recommendation to eat two serves of fruit and five serves of vegetables			1
' we do n't want people to be relying on these products for their fruit and veg content , ' she said			2
' nothing beats the real thing			0
' she urged shoppers to ignore claims and interrogate the ingredient list instead			0
fruit and vegetable claims are those stating the presence of fruit or vegetables ( ' made with real fruit ' ) , the fruit or vegetable content ( ' 80 % real fruit ' ) and / or the number of servings of fruit or vegetables they contain ( ' one cup contains three serves of vegetables ' )			1
' claims on food products can create a ' health halo ' , meaning that consumers perceive products carrying claims to be healthier than those that do not carry claims , ' the report stated			0
the report says less than 50 per cent of adults consume the recommended two servings of fruit and less than 10 per cent consume the recommended five servings of vegetables each day			0
it also states that increasing consumption of fruit and vegetables has been a public health priority for more than 20 years in @entity1			2
the report says these ' snacks ' are lollies and have none of the fibre of real fruit , and probably not the vitamins and minerals either			0
they are also sticky and very high in sugar ( nearly 60 % ) and not good for children 's teeth @entity19 has highlighted the following six products to show shoppers how they can be misled with products displaying the fruit and vegetable nutritional value			1
roll ups these products are only 25 per cent fruit , and this is ' concentrated puree ' or ' concentrated juice ' , meaning they have none of the fibre of real fruit , and probably not the vitamins and minerals either			2
they are also sticky and sugary and not good for children 's teeth and do not pass nutrient profiling , meaning they are not healthy enough to make a health claim			0
twisters while @entity175 contain 99.7 per cent fruit , this is ' concentrated puree ' or ' concentrated juice ' , meaning they have none of the fibre of real fruit , and probably not the vitamins and minerals either			0
these products are very high in sugar ( 67 % ) and not good for children 's teeth and they do not pass nutrient profiling , meaning they are not healthy enough to make a health claim			2
they claim to be the equivalent of 1 serve of fruit , but a serve of dried fruit is 30g , and these are 18g/serve			0
@entity188 these ' snacks ' are lollies			0
they have none of the fibre of real fruit , and probably not the vitamins and minerals either			0
the snacks are very high in sugar ( nearly 60 % ) and not good for children 's teeth , the labelling is confusing and they do not pass nutrient profiling , meaning they are not healthy enough to make a health claim			0
although this product does pass nutrient profiling , one serve of this product provides nearly half ( 44 % ) of an adult 's upper limit of sodium , more than 4 teaspoons of sugar , the report states @entity83 's @entity209 - claims to be made with real life raspberries there is only 13 % fruit juice in this product , and the second ingredient is sugar			2
@entity217 serve it has nearly 14 teaspoons of sugar			0
it does not pass nutrient profiling , meaning it is not healthy enough to make a health claim			0
@entity225 vegie serves per 300g can although this product does pass nutrient profiling , one serve of this product provides nearly half ( 44 % ) of an adult 's upper limit of sodium , more than 4 teaspoons of sugar			0
@entity235 's @entity234 - claims more than 6 serves of vegetables in every can although this product does pass nutrient profiling , one serve of this product provides 32 % of an adult 's upper limit of sodium , 3 teaspoons of sugar			2
there are 3.4 serves in a can , so it could imply that the number of serves in the can is reported when people would n't eat a full can			0
the veg ( tomato ) in this can is concentrated ( paste ) not whole veg , so will be low in fibre although this product does pass nutrient profiling , one serve of this product provides 32 per cent of an adult 's upper limit of sodium , 3 teaspoons of sugar ms @entity88 sees the number of nutritionally ' unhealthy ' products that contain fruit and vegetable claims on their packaging as extremely concerning			1
' dietary guidelines encourage @entity1 to eat two serves of fruit and five serves of vegetables each day , so food companies are cashing - in on this by clearly highlighting the fruit and vegetable content in their processed products , ' she said			1
' however , rather than helping to boost @entity1 ' fruit and vegetable intake , fruit and vegetable claims on packaging are encouraging them to choose highly processed and often unhealthy foods as a way of meeting their fruit and vegetable requirements			1
' ' despite what the labels say , we should n't rely on these drinks , sugary fruit snacks and salty soups to meet our daily needs			0
' ms @entity88 , said that as well as exploring fruit and / or vegetable content , the study also looked at the nutrient make - up of these products			1
' what we found was that these products contained much less dietary fibre and much more energy , saturated fat , sugar and sodium than their fresh fruit or vegetable equivalent , making them a poor substitute for the real thing			1

products with fruit and vegetable content not required to list amount
@entity19 and @entity20 researchers scoured shelves for days in @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30
one - third failed a basic nutrition test based on sugar , salt and fat levels
@entity1 researchers call for a *change* in the *regulations*
