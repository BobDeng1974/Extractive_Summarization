@entity2 , 32 , is accused of gambling away £ 1.5billion of the @entity8 bank 's money and wiping £ 3bn off its share price while working at its @entity12 headquarters			1
prosecutors claim the trader ignored financial controls , including trading limits , and invented phantom transactions to disguise his ' naked gambling ' from bosses in order to boost his ego and career prospects			1
it is alleged he was ' intimately aware ' of how @entity4 's trading controls worked after moving from the back office to trading floor and was able to play the system a result			1
but @entity2 hit back at allegations he took advantage of his knowledge of the bank 's inner workings today , saying he just wanted to ' do my job to the best of my ability '			1
he said : ' it was the ability to understand the interaction of systems and accounting processes that allows you to do your job			0
' it is not fraudulent ; it is finding a way to do your job			0
' he told the court he did not believe his ' rare skillset ' had made it ' easier ' for him to exploit the bank			1
' the reality is systems and processes evolve , number one			0
' number two , the reality is every single trader , and salesperson , trade support advisor , and settlement person has a duty to understand the system , the tools that we use			1
' so i do not think it is fair to say that my experience in settlement and trade support enabled me to more easily do something that has been characterised as fraud			0
' those experiences enabled me to do my job to the best of my ability			0
' in an at times emotional start to his evidence @entity2 wept twice when asked about his father , who sat in the public gallery , and his ' mentor ' at @entity4 @entity85 , the former head of the etf desk			1
mr justice @entity87 told him he should not be embarrassed as it gave the jury a chance to ' see the man behind the name '			2
@entity95 described @entity4 as his family , adding : ' every single bit of effort i put in to that organisation was for the benefit of the bank , the people around me , and the book i worked on			2
the bank for which was so proud to work			2
he told the court he had begun to trade off the book in a bid to generate enough profit to offset annual $ 40m losses being made by the etf desk			1
he said that for three years from 2008 to 2010 the desk had lost £ 24m , and that in the first six months of 2011 , before his arrest , it had lost £ 12m			0
the trader said the losses had come about from balance sheet costs , client execution costs , dividend slippage , and being unable to hedge certain equities			2
@entity2 said his life had become overcome by his efforts to make the @entity122 desk profitable			1
he told the jury he had missed his grandmother 's funeral because of the work he was putting in to his job			2
' every moment of every day spent thinking about " how do i make this book work ? "			0
' nothing else was important enough to overcome that			0
' he said that through his constant market - watching he had begun to develop a ' gut instinct ' for how it would move			0
@entity2 told the court that when he spoke to @entity136 , his ' supervisor and go - to person ' he was ' not really interested ' in off - setting the losses			1
' he said : ' you begin to have to consider if i was committing a fraud because i was doing it for my own benefit , ultimately , my intent in every trade i was doing was to generate profits which would offset the costs which we could not find a way to hedge			0
' in the process of doing so i began to learn more and more about how the market worked			0
' i was growing more confident in my ability to call the market , to understand what might happen next in the market			0
' as a result of that extra confidence by the end of 2009 i had made £ 3.5m profit for the book			2
' my end goal was to generate £ 24m of profit that i could then release in to the book to offset the costs that i thought the book would incur in the period of a year			0
' @entity2 , 32 , is accused of gambling away £ 1.5billion of @entity4 's money and wiping £ 3bn off its share price while working at its @entity12 headquarters @entity2 went on to deny the prosecution suggestion that he was a ' gambler '			1
he said : ' it 's not " i will just do a gamble on the market because that 's fun " and the outcome i will hide away in a cash trade , absolutely not			0
actually the cash trade is the end goal			0
' he said the ' umbrella ' , which prosecutors have suggested was a secret ' slush fund ' , was nothing more than an ' accounting mechanism ' to help the etf desk offset its losses , adding that his colleagues @entity136 , @entity186 , and @entity187 , were all aware of its existence			2
@entity2 went on to describe mr @entity85 , who left @entity4 before the period in which @entity2 is alleged to have begun his fraudulent activities , as having a ' lot of strong relationships ' and being ' good at managing ' both him and his desk colleague @entity136			1
after @entity85 left , @entity136 took over as ' supervisor ' of the etf desk , said @entity2 , leaving two young men in charge of a ' $ 50bn book '			1
@entity136 , who gave evidence earlier in the trial , was described by @entity2 as ' quite maverick ' and ' gung - ho '			1
he said : ' he did not really care about the book as a whole			0
he cared about being profitable as a trader			2
' @entity2 worked in the back office at @entity4 from september 2003 until december 2005 when he was employed as a trader			1
in september 2006 he was moved to the global synthetic equities division on the exchange traded funds ( @entity122 ) desk buying and selling @entity212 , which track different types of stocks , bonds or commodities such as metals			0
at the start of today 's hearing two additional charges of false accounting were added to the indictment			0
mr @entity87 , outlining what he described as the ' sensible reasons ' for adding the charges , told the jury : ' it 's been decided to add two additional counts to the indictment			2
' those additional counts do not add to the allegations which have already been made against mr @entity2			1
' they have been inserted to clarify the allegations which are being made			2
' @entity2 , from @entity12 , denies two counts of fraud by abuse of position and four counts of false accounting			1
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
