manor team principal @entity0 has assured critics the marque will be on track and competing in the next @entity5 race in @entity6 later this month			1
resurrected from @entity8 's ashes and wrested from the clutches of administration by energy entrepreneur @entity11 , a reborn @entity12 headed to @entity13 for the season - opening race at the weekend with every intention of taking to @entity18 's @entity17 circuit			1
although the cars passed crash tests and wider scrutiny , @entity12 failed to emerge from the garage even once as they ran out of time in a bid to rebuild their it infrastructure , lost after all hardware was wiped days before a planned auction of the team 's assets			1
manor team principal @entity0 is confident his team will race in @entity6 later this month although the @entity33 cleared @entity12 of a potential breach of the rules as they were investigated for failing to fulfil obligations to compete , @entity5 supremo @entity32 was left far from impressed			1
@entity32 claims @entity12 had ' zero ' intention of taking part and has threatened to charge them for all freight costs which are borne by @entity41 for all teams for every race			2
despite that , when asked by @entity44 on saturday after the team had failed to take part in qualifying whether @entity32 was being kept in the loop about their issues , @entity0 confirmed that was the case			0
manor drivers @entity52 and @entity54 are expected to compete in @entity6 ' @entity32 just misses nothing , does he ? he has been kept aware at every stage of the process , ' replied @entity0			1
as to whether @entity32 was supportive , @entity0 nodded and said : ' yep			0
' the suggestion from sceptics was @entity12 were in @entity13 simply to lay claim to the Â£ 28million owed to them by @entity32 in prize money after back - to - back top - 10 finishes in the constructors ' championship			2
@entity0 , however , dismissed the notion as he said : ' we 're entered in the @entity5 and we felt it important to be present in @entity13 and try and compete			2
the @entity12 team work on their car in the garage in @entity13 ' i can understand people being cynical , but if that was the case we would n't have brought 30 tonnes of equipment , 40 people , fulfilled our contracts with all suppliers - @entity78 , @entity79 , whoever - with our best endeavours to go round and round a circuit			1
' @entity0 claims another day of behind - the - scenes graft would likely have been enough for the team to turn a wheel , underlining his confidence that @entity6 will hold difficulties			0
asked whether @entity52 and @entity54 will be on track in @entity89 on march 27 for practice , @entity0 replied : ' absolutely			0
' we 're in a massively different place now than where we were at the start of last week			0
' the progress was colossal , just not quite enough , but now we 'll get to @entity6 on monday , start setting up at the circuit on tuesday , and for sure we 'll be ready to run on friday			0
' @entity96 cruises to victory in @entity13 gp			0
