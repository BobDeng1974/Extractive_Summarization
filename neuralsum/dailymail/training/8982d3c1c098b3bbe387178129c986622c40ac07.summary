by @entity0 in @entity1 published : 14:20 est , 4 august 2013 updated : 08:45 est , 5 august 2013 the slums of @entity1 are undergoing radical transformations as the state authority continues its hardline strategy of using the military and police to physically clear the ghettos of the drug dynasties that have controlled them for decades			1
so far 140 favelas in @entity1 city have been pacified , the term that indicates a community has been freed from the grip of drug traffickers			2
there are still , however , over 1,000 favelas in @entity19 that remain unpacified			0
dominant : the @entity21 favela will soon have a 500 - store shopping centre - the first to be built in any of @entity1 's slums			1
the area is made up of 13 different communities built on several hills in the north of @entity1 city view from the top : the favela 's cable car covers 3.5 km and is the second most popular tourist attraction in the city , behind the @entity33 statue nevertheless , for the shanty - towns that are now experiencing peace , the cessation of violence is having a dramatic and positive effect on hundreds of lives and injecting opportunities and growth into what was a poverty - striken and neglected economy			1
recent research by @entity45 ’s @entity44 found that around 12 million people living in shanty - towns now earn over £ 16 billion a year and are fast becoming a new and lucrative consumer market			0
around 65 percent of favela residents are considered middle class , versus 37 percent in 2002			2
' this used to be an invisible market , because it was right under our noses , ' says data popular director @entity56 , ' but people only saw favelas through the perspective of violence and drug trafficking			1
' much of the growth is attributed to @entity45 ’s emerging economy , low levels of unemployment and government initiatives that have pulled thousands out of poverty and in the case of the pacification projects , brought stability and urban renewal to communities			0
according to the @entity78 survey , over the last ten years the number of those living in favelas with washing machines doubled to over 50 percent			0
nearly 90 percent have cell phones , and 40 percent have computers			0
around 45 percent are regular internet users			0
about 70 percent of favela residents go to the shopping centre every week , and 50 percent eat out on a weekly basis			1
silver screen : the improvements to the favela include a cinema - the first to be brought to a slum			1
the area has benefitted from the state 's strategy to physically remove their drug factions now the first favela mall is being planned for the @entity21 slum complex , an area made up of 15 different communities , based in the north of @entity100			1
developers say the shopping centre will have 500 stores and create 6,000 jobs			1
the opening of the mall in @entity21 will be a huge boost to an area that is already beginning to thrive following pacification and growing interest from thousands of tourists			1
every weekend the number of foreigners and visitors using the local transport going into @entity21 surpasses the numbers of residents taking the same route as passengers			1
that ’s because the favela boasts a surprising major attraction in the shape of a 152 cable car service that provides one of the most stunning views of the hillside shanty - town and breathtaking scenic vistas of the @entity1 cityscape			1
covering 3.5 kilometers from the bottom to the top in just under 20 minutes and stopping at five stations on the way , the gondola trip up the @entity21 has become so popular with tourists that it is now the second most visited location in @entity1 according to @entity133 , from @entity1 ’s international communications office			1
' the @entity140 cable cars have pushed the @entity142 cable car attraction into third place			1
tourism to @entity21 now sits behind the @entity145 which is still in first place			1
' last year over six million people visited @entity21 using the cable cars and every day it carries more than 12,000 passengers into the heart of the slum , ' she said			1
it ’s a far cry from when the @entity21 favela was a no - go area even for the police			1
@entity158 effort : a sports centre for children sits just outside the favela			1
it models itself on the training and commitment ethos of an @entity158 village vast : there are many areas of the densely populated favela that will not benefit from the upgrades three years ago the densely packed slum was the stronghold of the feared @entity174 gangsters			1
the drug traffickers controlled the comings and goings of the 300,000 residents and dictated their daily lives which were blighted by drug - fueled shootouts and stray bullets that often took innocent lives			2
now thanks to the pacification strategy that saw 3,000 armed security agents enter the favela with tanks and machine guns and wrest control of the territory from drug factions in 2010 , the slum dwellers can go in and out as they please as the security of the area is now provided by a permanent police presence - the @entity195 ( @entity196 )			1
grocery store holder , @entity197 , 36 , has lived in @entity21 all his life and says he has seen a lot of changes for the better since the drug traffickers were forced out of the slum			1
' it is more peaceful and calmer			0
we are beginning to have a normal life here that everyone else who has never lived in a favela takes for granted , ' mr @entity197 says			2
' we used to pay taxes to the drug dealers for a poor service , now we are getting a public service which has more guarantees , ' he adds			2
@entity213 , 38 , who has lived in @entity21 for 25 years , gave up his job last year as a telecoms technician to take advantage of the increasing numbers of visitors after pacification			2
he opened up a bistro in the heart of the favela specializing in @entity224 beers			2
' if we did n’t have the @entity196 here i would n’t have opened my bistro because people from outside the community would n’t come , ' says mr @entity213			0
' my customers are evenly divided between residents , non residents and tourists			0
the @entity196 has improved the frequency and increased the movement of people in the complex , ' he adds			0
more than £ 250 million from the government ’s growth acceleration programme ( @entity240 ) has been ploughed into the hillside shanty - town bringing new health clinics , creches and sports areas along with 1500 new homes			0
noticeable improvements include better road systems , waste management services , upgrades in street lighting and a heavily used complaints hotline phone number that dials direct to @entity1 authorities on which residents can voice their grievances , make suggestions and notify officials of problems in their vicinity			0
however , the complex is so large that there are still many areas in the favela that have not benefited from the upgrading and changes			2
@entity265 , director of the institute for moving roots , a local organization that seeks to promote social and cultural development says : ' in the poorer areas of the complex there are still homes of wood and wattle and daub , which accentuates the disparity in relation to the areas where there has been effective action by the government			0
' peace : grocer @entity284 ( left ) said life has improved since drug traffickers left the area			2
@entity289 ( right ) @entity290 ( second right ) play football in the favela 's sports centre where 19 sports are on offer educational : a new technology centre gives precious access to computers and tablets with training for adults and educational playtime for children he says the plans drawn up by the authorities , mostly , do not reflect the needs of residents , such as basic sanitation			1
' the government has just been acting from its own point of view and not from the standpoint of the community			0
' one initiative that has been welcomed by the community which was impossible to implement while the drug lords ruled is the mapping of @entity21 ’s streets			1
for years there has been no road names just a warren of alleyways that only favela dwellers could make sense of			2
now roads are being given names , houses numbers and people postal addresses			0
' before i got a postal address i used to collect all my mail from my neighbourhood association			0
' they would announcement the arrival of the post on loud speakers and the community radio			0
now we are starting to get deliveries by postal workers , ' says mr @entity197			0
the first favela cinema – @entity346 – has been opened in @entity21 and a technology centre provides access to computers and tablets with training for adults and educational playtime for children			1
many of the youngsters use the centre for homework support and they also get the opportunity to play video games			2
an athletics and exercise centre for children that models itself on the training and commitment ethos of an @entity158 village is situated just on the edge of @entity21			1
the centre offers over 19 different sports including , swimming , football , basketball , ji jitsu and gymnastics			0
thirteen year old @entity289 has n’t missed a day of football since @entity21 was liberated			2
' i come here twice a week to play and it ’s so different now that we have had the changes			0
' i do n’t like talking about the times before when things were bad , i like to forget it and when i play football it helps me to do that , ' he said			0
@entity387 , advisor to the secretary of sports and leisure for @entity1 , says : ' all the children who come to the sports centre have been living in a war zone since they were born			0
this centre helps them to reassimilate into normal life and rebuild their self - esteem			0
' we provide therapy and discipline through sport which strengthens their social values such as respect for rules and collaborative work and we hope this will positively shape their future attitude as they grow up			0
