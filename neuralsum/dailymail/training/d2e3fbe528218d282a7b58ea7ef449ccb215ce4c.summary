@entity1 boss @entity0 has no doubt @entity3 can handle the pressure of expectation			1
the @entity7 striker became the @entity9 ' record signing in july after scoring almost a goal every other game for @entity12 last season			1
@entity3 has no @entity15 experience but marked his debut with a well - taken goal as @entity1 began life back in the top flight by drawing 2 - 2 against @entity20 at the @entity21			1
@entity3 harried the @entity20 defence throughout , and @entity0 said of the 28 - year - old : ' i think he showed a lot of qualities			1
' his strength and his work - rate will probably have surprised a few people			0
he 's a real team player and i think our players have very quickly recognised his strengths			2
goal : @entity3 scored on his @entity15 debut against @entity20 ' when you become a club 's record signing there is an added pressure that goes with that , but he handles that very well			1
' the perception in terms of the value is probably measured differently externally to what i do			0
i 'm very pleased for @entity45 because he is a focal point in terms of how we play , he 's got a good goalscoring record and i 'm pleased he 's got off the mark			2
' @entity3 's goal cancelled out @entity53 's opener less than two minutes after @entity20 had taken the lead			1
the @entity20 went back ahead just before half - time through @entity56 but @entity1 secured a point four minutes from time thanks to substitute @entity59			2
@entity59 's goal was made by midfielder @entity61 , whose trickery caught the eye throughout the match			0
record : @entity3 scored almost a goal every other game while at @entity12 last season the 23 - year - old joined @entity1 from @entity70 in january and his performances over the second half of last season earned him a spot in @entity76 's @entity75 squad			1
@entity0 said : ' when you consider the progression he 's had in the last 12 months , it would be very easy to ask too much of somebody like him			1
' he 's joined us as a relative unknown and been selected for @entity76 in the @entity75 and now finds himself playing in the @entity15			1
' he 's a talented boy , there 's no doubt about that , but my job is to make sure i protect my players			0
' i 've got no doubt he can deliver in the @entity15 but i also understand where he 's at as a young man learning his trade			1
he 's not going to be able to perform miracles week in , week out			0
' one frustration for @entity0 was a hamstring injury picked up by @entity96 in the first half			2
draw : @entity0 's side earned a valuable draw with @entity100 's @entity20 the @entity1 boss was already without new signings @entity102 and @entity104 , striker @entity105 and midfielder @entity106 because of injury			1
' it probably means we will try to add to the squad between now and the end of the window because the numbers game is important , ' said @entity0 , who is continuing to pursue former @entity7 international @entity114			2
a shadow was cast over the start of @entity20 's season by a knee injury to key midfielder @entity119			2
the club are still waiting to find out the extent of the damage but manager @entity100 fears he could be missing for months			0
transfer : at Â£ 8.75m , the @entity7 striker is @entity1 's most expensive transfer ever the @entity127 was content with how his side responded , bar the lapse of concentration that allowed @entity59 to earn @entity1 a point			1
' that 's football , ' said @entity100 of @entity119 's absence			0
' you 're going to get injuries , you 're going to get suspensions and what we need to do is make sure we react as a team , and i think we did that			0
' i thought @entity142 to play 90 minutes was phenomenal , he did n't have the right to play 90 minutes and he showed he 's going to get fit very quickly , which is something we did n't expect			0
' i think everyone contributed			0
@entity150 and @entity151 showed flashes of their very best understanding , the control from @entity148 and @entity149 was back to the level of last season , and @entity53 is a fresh player			0
' the back four looked too comfortable , and that was the problem			0
if i would have been sitting here with a victory , it would have been a great start to the season			0
