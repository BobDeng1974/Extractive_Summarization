by @entity1 reporter published : 13:32 est , 6 march 2014 updated : 21:42 est , 6 march 2014 @entity3 ordered the @entity5 's first sanctions in response to @entity8 's military takeover of @entity9 on thursday , declaring his determination not to let the @entity11 carve up @entity12			1
the president asserted that a hastily scheduled referendum on @entity9 seceding and becoming part of @entity8 would violate international law			1
@entity18 leaders announced their own measures but split over how forcefully to follow @entity21 's lead			2
@entity3 threatened further steps if @entity8 persists			0
laying down the law : president @entity3 said that @entity21 is working in conjunction with international partners but also signed an executive order to levy sanctions on @entity8 and revoked visas for certain @entity8 nationals after announcing his sanctions at midday , @entity3 emphasized his resolve in a personal telephone call with @entity8 president @entity34 later thursday , the @entity30 said			1
in a one - hour discussion , @entity3 affirmed his contention that @entity8 's actions violate @entity12 's sovereignty			2
the president told @entity34 there was still a way to resolve the dispute diplomatically , the @entity30 said , with @entity8 forces moving back to their base in @entity9 , the governments of @entity12 and @entity8 holding direct talks and international monitors arriving			1
the @entity21 is also calling on @entity8 to recognize the legitimacy of @entity12 plans for elections in may , not the @entity9 referendum a week from sunday			1
in all , signs still pointed to a continuing diplomatic battle over @entity12 and what could prove a broader fault line in @entity18 's @entity57 order			2
while @entity58 and @entity5 no longer threaten nuclear war and have vastly expanded commercial ties , @entity8 is determined to dominate the future of the former @entity63 republics along its borders			0
@entity70 , its @entity67 partners and others across the continent are striving to pull these nations out of @entity73 's orbit			0
crisis talks : @entity3 told president @entity34 in a telephone call that @entity8 could still end its takeover in @entity9 diplomatically underscoring his position , @entity3 issued an executive action slapping new visa restrictions on @entity8 and other opponents of @entity12 's government in @entity83 and authorizing wider financial penalties against those involved in the military intervention or in stealing state assets			1
none of the measures appeared aimed at the @entity8 president personally			0
' today the world can see that the @entity21 is united with our allies and partners in upholding international law and pursuing a just outcome that advances global security and the future that the @entity12 people deserve , ' @entity3 said at the @entity30			1
' that 's what we 're going to continue to do in the days to come until we have seen a resolution to this crisis			0
' @entity3 hailed @entity21 cooperation with the @entity105 , which imposed its own sanctions on @entity8 on thursday			1
in an emergency meeting in @entity109 , @entity105 leaders decided to suspend talks with @entity34 's government on a wide - ranging economic agreement and on granting @entity8 citizens visa - free travel within the 28 - nation bloc - a long - standing @entity8 objective			0
at the same time , @entity18 's presidents and prime ministers were divided on more drastic steps such as freezing assets and issuing travel bans on @entity8 officials			0
on guard : the @entity9 parliament called a referendum on march 16 to secede and join @entity8 but international leaders , including president @entity3 , says taht is illegal @entity18 hesitancy reflected the reality that targeting influential @entity8 businessmen or major @entity8 companies would also harm @entity18 's economic interests			1
@entity8 investors hold assets worth billions in @entity18 banks , particularly in @entity135 and @entity136 , and major exporters such as @entity138 and the @entity139 have far more at stake than the @entity21 in @entity8 's consumer economy			2
many other @entity18 countries depend on @entity8 for oil and gas supplies			0
@entity8 troops have seized control of much of @entity9 , where ethnic @entity8 are the majority			0
@entity73 does n't recognize the @entity12 government that came to power after protesters ousted the country 's @entity154 president last month			1
@entity34 and other officials have cited strategic interests as well as the protection of ethnic @entity8 in making the case for intervention			0
@entity8 leases a major navy base there			0
the @entity5 debate over how strongly to penalize @entity8 is important given that neither the @entity21 nor @entity18 is advocating the use of force			2
the @entity21 military has stepped up joint aviation training with @entity169 forces and @entity21 participation in @entity67 's air - policing mission in its @entity173 countries			2
but the @entity175 , like its @entity67 partners , has strictly ruled out military options			0
president @entity3 declared that the prospect of a portion of the @entity12 seceding in order to join @entity8 is against international law			1
' we are well beyond the days where borders can be redrawn ' without @entity185 leaders , ' he said at a thursday press conference in the @entity30			0
the president warned that if the @entity8 would continue in their current path , ' the resolve of the @entity21 and our allies and the international community will remain firm			1
' press secretary @entity192 followed up by saying that the @entity21 government is holding @entity8 accountable for their role in the ongoing political struggle in the @entity12			1
the steps that @entity8 has taken violates @entity12 sovereignty and is a breach of international law , ' @entity192 said			1
the president spoke out strongly against a proposed march 16 referendum that @entity9 politicians suggested to vote on whether or not they will secede from @entity12 in order to join @entity8			1
he said that the referendum would ' violate the @entity12 constitution and violate international law '			1
any such referendum , he said , must include representatives from the legitimate @entity12 government - which was not included in the original plan			1
@entity3 also signed an executive order that will allow the @entity21 to levy financial sanctions			1
in a statement , the @entity30 said the penalties would target ' those who are most directly involved in destabilizing @entity12 , including the military intervention in @entity9 , and does not preclude further steps should the situation deteriorate			2
' meanwhile in @entity109 , the @entity105 announced it was suspending talks with @entity8 on an economic pact and on a visa deal in response to the @entity8 intervention in @entity9			0
@entity105 leaders , like @entity3 , threatened further sanctions if @entity8 pushes ahead			0
officials in @entity70 said @entity8 government officials and entities could be among those sanctioned in the @entity21 action , though president @entity34 is unlikely to be targeted directly			1
' we call on @entity8 to take the opportunity before it to resolve this crisis through direct and immediate dialogue with the government of @entity12 , ' the @entity30 statement read			2
control : soldiers seen in front of the @entity241 in @entity242 in @entity9 on thursday show the force that @entity8 has exerted into the area @entity12 's unrest peaked in february , after months of @entity5 protests seeking the overthrow of president @entity248 in anger over economic woes and corruption			2
@entity248 , who is @entity154 , fled for protection to a location just outside of @entity73 , and @entity34 sent troops into @entity9 in a show of force against the upstart government in @entity83			0
@entity9 is a peninsula that hosts a major @entity8 navy base and is historically and culturally a @entity8 stronghold			0
the visa bans will be imposed immediately and come in addition to an earlier @entity264 decision to deny @entity21 entry to those involved in human rights abuses related to political oppression in @entity12			1
officials would not say whether @entity248 was a target of the visa ban or the sanctions			0
the sanctions plan , outlined in an executive order , lays the legal groundwork for the @entity276 to impose financial penalties on offenders			0
the aim is clearly to punish the separatist movement in @entity9 as well as @entity8 for its decision to send military forces there			0
calling legal shots : president @entity3 said thursday that it is clear that @entity8 has violated international law in trying to have @entity9 succeed from the @entity12 and reconnect with @entity8 specifically , the sanctions would target people who undermine @entity12 's democracy and new government ; threaten the country 's peace , security , stability and sovereignty ; are linked to misappropriations of government assets ; and try to assert governmental authority over any part of @entity12 without the consent of @entity83			1
they would also prohibit @entity21 persons from doing business with those who have been sanctioned			0
@entity302 has been rushing to impose hard - hitting sanctions on @entity8 in response to its takeover of @entity9 , hoping @entity18 will follow the lead of the @entity21 in upping the pressure on @entity34 's government			2
the @entity21 sanctions push represents a rare case of broad agreement among the @entity3 administration and @entity185 and @entity313 in both houses of @entity302			2
that said , they all are also united in their concern that @entity21 economic penalties will mean little without the participation of @entity18 countries with far deeper commercial relations with @entity8 .			0

@entity21 pulls visa approval for anyone helping destabilize the @entity12 and left the path open for future financial sanctions
