by @entity0 published : 08:20 est , 7 february 2014 @entity2 : 13:04 est , 7 february 2014 for children of the 1970s and early 1980s , no saturday afternoon was complete without watching @entity4 and @entity5 wrestle each other to the ground in front of a hysterical live audience			1
adult wrestling was considered prime family entertainment , and girls and boys sat transfixed as the 26 - stone , leotard - clad @entity4 ( real name : @entity4 ) led the crowd with chants of ' easy , easy ' before demolishing his opponent with his trademark ' splash ' , which involved felling them with his stomach in ( often carefully choreographed ) violent bouts			2
the frightening - looking @entity5 was his arch rival , and at 48 stone , quite some opponent , and most children , as well as the @entity26 and @entity27 , who both declared themselves fans , knew whose side they were on			0
the masked wrestler @entity30 ( aka @entity31 ) was another household name who rose to such prominence that his 1977 unmasking ceremony was televised ( though @entity4 had managed the same feat two years earlier )			0
the wrestling bouts were filmed in front of live audiences at venues around the country , and , as this collection of old posters which have just come to light show , lucky residents of towns around @entity39 chosen to host the bouts could buy a ticket for as little as Â£ 1 to see their heroes fight each other live			0
clash of the super-heavyweights : @entity4 pitting his 26 - stone , leotard - clad body against 48 - stone rival @entity5 was top family entertainment in the 70s and 80s @entity4 became a household name known for his glitzy costumes ( his wife , @entity59 , made his first leotard out of their chintz sofa cover ) and vast , rippling stomach no holds barred : @entity4 , pictured above left , usually played the good guy while @entity5 , pictured left and against @entity66 , right , would often be jeered big draw : the wrestlers performed in front of live audiences and locals could buy ringside seats and join @entity4 in chanting ' easy , easy ' as he took his rivals down essential weekend viewing : as this copy of the @entity78 from june 1971 shows , wrestling was a regular one - hour slot on @entity81 's saturday afternoon schedule people would flock to venues around the country to watch live wrestling featuring stars such as @entity87 , left , who was known as a villain who bent the rules wrestling posters such as these were a common sight in the 1970s and 1980s , and the sport 's stars became huge stars - the @entity26 and @entity27 were both fans political correctness was a long way off in the 1970s when a night out watching some of the most famous sportsmen of the day could cost as little as 75p the wrestling stars built up characters for themselves with trademark costumes , catchphrases and moves - @entity4 's was his notorious @entity105 jump for more of the @entity39 wrestling superstars , bigger was better - those with particularly large stomachs were feared in the ring , but others concentrated on muscles women wrestlers , such as @entity113 , left , were popular too , and the biggest stars filled the biggest arenas , with @entity4 taking on @entity5 at @entity116			1

old wrestling posters show huge popularity of the sport that kept @entity39 's families glued to their sofas at weekends
wrestling was televised and its champions like @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity87 were *massive* stars
the bouts were often fake - carefully choreographed complete with groans from the loser - but few children knew it
