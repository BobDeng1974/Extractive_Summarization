choice and the @entity7 have put out a list of retail traps they say shoppers should avoid this festive season 1			1
expensive christmas @entity26 before you buy a gift basket or hamper , make sure you check the quality of the ingredients inside and their individual prices			0
choice spokesman @entity32 said an investigation found that some hampers – including @entity35 's @entity5 and @entity36 – are over 20 percent more expensive than the items cost online at @entity38 and @entity39			1
choice also found hidden among great gifts such as chocolates and wine were mundane items like two - minute noodles and cans of spaghetti			2
@entity48 extended warranties when buying electronics , appliances and whitegoods do n't fall for buying an unnecessary extended warranty			2
shoppers are covered for the right to a refund , repair or replacement under consumer law			1
mr @entity32 says to apply the ' reasonable person 's test ' – if a reasonable person would expect an item to last longer than 12 months or two years but it breaks before this time , then you are able to invoke your rights			0
this month , appliance company @entity67 was fined $ 200,000 for sending letters to customers who purchased dishwashers , saying they needed to pay up to $ 220 to extend the product 's warranty beyond two years			0
@entity74 justice @entity73 said the statement was ' false and misleading ' because the company only included the correct part of consumer law in fine print on the reverse side of the letter			1
the @entity7 alleges @entity82 ' lay - by contracts allowed the company to continue to take payments by direct debit after the consumer had fully paid for their lay - by agreement the items contained in the @entity90 cost less if you buy them at @entity38 or @entity39 3			1
@entity93 the @entity7 has warned @entity94 to watch out for scammers who send emails posing as postal services and asking for money for parcel delivery			2
the con artists pose as @entity102 or @entity103 , and send emails telling people they missed a parcel delivery at home			0
the emails say that information for retrieving the package is included in an attachment			0
but the file is actually and executable file (			0
exe ) and once opened , will install ransomware on your computer			0
ransomware is a type of malware that restricts access to the computer system that it infects , and demands a ransom be paid to the creator of the malware in order for the restriction to be removed			0
other scams offer to redeliver the parcel at another time for a fee of up to $ 30			0
the @entity7 has received 400 complaints about the issue from @entity94 this year who have lost a total of $ 100,000			2
misleading lay - by agreements on monday , the @entity7 started proceedings against @entity82 alleging the company included an unfair contract term in its 2014 lay - by agreements			1
@entity35 's ' @entity140 ' allegedly allowed @entity35 to continue to take payments by direct debit after the consumer had fully paid for their lay - by agreement			1
under this term , consumers were required to opt out in order to avoid having further payments deducted after their lay - by has been paid for			1
it is also alleged that @entity35 charged consumers a lay - by termination fee in excess of @entity157 's reasonable costs in relation to those lay - by agreements			1
misleading lay - by contracts and unnecessary warranties are among the things shoppers should be wary of 5			1
not - so - free - range eggs before you grab a carton of free range eggs to make that @entity5 pavlova , double check that they really are free range			2
choice found that @entity94 are willing to pay $ 3 - $ 5 more per dozen for eggs that are free - range , but there is no legally binding definition of free - range so it is difficult to know if you are purchasing the real deal			2

the @entity7 alleges that from 31 december 2013 to 6 october 2014 , @entity180 labelled eggs as ' free range ' when in fact the laying hens had been continuously confined to barns and had never had access to the outdoors			2
expensive cosmetics many shoppers resort to lipsticks and other cosmetics as easy stocking - fillers , but @entity94 face a significant mark - up on most major make - up and fragrance labels			0
choice suggests shopping on overseas websites using a virtual private network ( @entity202 ) to hide the fact you are shopping from @entity94 in order to access lower prices			0
earlier this month , the @entity7 took action against @entity181 alleging their ' free range ' claims were misleading 7			2
@entity211 cards that @entity212 make sure you read the fine print of any gift cards you purchase and be on the lookout for unreasonable restrictions			0
choice recommends cards that can be used at multiple retailers , with no expiry date			0
credit cards with high interest fees choice research shows 48 percent of @entity94 do n't know the interest rate they pay on their credit card			0
before you rack up debt buying @entity5 present and groceries , make sure you know what you will need to repay and that you can afford the payments			0
