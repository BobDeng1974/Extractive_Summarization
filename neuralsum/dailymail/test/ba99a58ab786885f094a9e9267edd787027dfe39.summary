a remote @entity1 fort built by the @entity2 as a look out post on top of a 20 - foot - high sea stack has been uncovered on the coast of @entity8			1
archaeologists believe the stronghold , which would have been cut off from the land at high tide , may have been one of a number that lined the east coast of @entity8			1
the fort , which was found on top of the @entity18 sea stack close to @entity19 , @entity20 , appears to have been built with stone imported from elsewhere in the country			1
the small fort was discovered on top of @entity18 sea stack ( shown above ) and would have given the inhabitants a strong defensive position , although resupplying the fort up the cliff faces would have been hard stones used to construct the walls were also engraved with @entity32 designs of fish and disks with broken spears through them			1
dr @entity37 , an archaeologist at @entity38 who led the excavation , said the site was so remote it could only be accessed by climbing up the cliff face with ropes			1
the @entity2 were a group of tribes who lived north of the @entity45 and @entity46 during the @entity1 and early medieval period			0
by the late 200s ad the @entity2 had overrun the northern frontier of the @entity49 more than once			0
@entity51 's blue face paint in @entity52 is a nod to the @entity32 tradition of body - paint - but the real @entity2 fought stark naked , and there are records of them doing so up until the 5th century			0
the @entity59 name for the people - @entity2 - means ' painted people '			0
it 's not known what they called themselves			0
the habit of fighting naked , especially in the cold @entity8 climate , did n't harm the tribe 's reputation for ferocity			1
@entity2 were one of the reasons even heavily armoured @entity59 legions could not conquer the area			0
he said it appeared that despite its position , the fort had been lived in for extended periods and so must have been an important building			0
dr @entity37 said it was possible the fort had been built there to help the @entity32 tribes living there dominate the sea in the area			1
he said it was possible the fort , which is thought to date from the 5th to 6th century , could also have been a precursor to @entity91 , a medieval fortress built on the rocks of a headland less than quarter of a mile away			2
dr @entity37 said : ‘ it is possible that there was a series of forts along the coast			2
' the @entity2 were known as sea raiders and forts like this may have helped cement that naval power			2
‘ it is quite an impressive site			0
it was pretty hairy climb to get up there and at high tide it is completely cut off			0
resupplying the fort when it was inhabited would have been a challenge			0
’ the @entity2 were a group of tribes that lived in eastern and northern @entity8			2
although best known for the carved stones and jewellery they left behind , it is thought that they were farmers but also engaged in sea raids			0
the archaeologists discovered the fort on @entity121 after following up reports that pictish stones had been found there when some local youths climbed up the sea stack			1
dr @entity37 said : ‘ being youths , they did what youths do and threw them down into the sea			0
‘ one of them returned later to collect one of the stones and since then a few others have been found			0
they had rough designs carved into them			0
’ when dr @entity37 and his team from the @entity139 @entity2 project conducted a five day excavation on the top of the site , they uncovered the remains of what appears to be a rampart wall			2
they also found post holes and the remains of a hearth that appears to have been within a house built inside the fort			1
they even found charcoal still in the stone fire place			1
mr @entity37 said there may have been a settlement built on the land behind the fort , although as the @entity2 largely built their homes from wood , it would be hard to find many remains			1
in order to reach the site , the team had to employ the services of professional rock climber @entity168 , who climbed up the sea stack and put ropes in place			1
the archaeologists found the remains of a stone wall that would have formed part of the @entity1 fort some of the stones used to build the walls of the fort ( like the one above ) had rough @entity32 carvings on them the sea stack is only accessible at low tide and still requires a rock climb up the cliff face to reach the summit this stone hearth , with the black charcoal dust still evident at the bottom of the picture , was uncovered by the team			1
it suggests the fort had been inhabited for relatively long periods , according to dr @entity37 mr @entity37 said that at the time when the fort had been inhabited it may have had a wooden bridge across to the stack from the land otherwise it would have been very hard to access			2
he said : ‘ the stone is not local , so it was quarried elsewhere and taken to build the fort and carved			2
‘ as for access , it is possible an easier route was present on the landward side and has now eroded , but certainly a timber access of some kind is well within their capabilities			0
’ the team now hope to examine some of the charcoal and other artifacts they found at the site in the hope of getting a better understanding of who lived there			2
the @entity121 sea stack sits just off the east coast of @entity8 close to @entity19 in @entity20 the researchers also found evidence for post holes ( above ) that were used in the fort ramparts during the dig archaeologists had to set up ropes to reach the sea stack after a professional climber scaled the rock face dunnicaer sea stack ( on the far left of the picture above ) is just quarter of a mile from @entity91 ( right )			1

*ancient* fort was built on 20 - foot sea stack near @entity19 , @entity20
archaeologists needed to use ropes to reach the summit for the excavation
they found remains of stone walls , ramparts and a charcoal filled fireplace
*experts* believe it may have been one of a line of forts along @entity8 coast
