an undisturbed 6,000 - year - old encampment , which was likely home to the forefathers of @entity2 , has been discovered			2
carbon dating last week established the ‘ first proof ’ of a settlement at @entity6 in @entity7 , which predates the famous monument nearby			1
a spokesman for the project , told @entity12 : ‘ it ’s the first proof of people living there earlier , and indicates that @entity2 could have been planned for years			1
archaeologists at the @entity29 , led by @entity30 , found the ancient site last october , which is around one - and - a - half miles ( 2.4km ) from @entity2			2
‘ it ’s the first indication of a settlement , not just people passing through and dropping tools , ’ the spokesman said			2
dr @entity30 said that further inspection of the site could ‘ rewrite @entity38 history ’			1
archaeologists at the @entity29 , led by @entity30 found the ancient site last october , which is around one - and - a - half miles ( 2.4km ) from @entity2 ( pictured ) experts tested charcoal that was dug up from the site , to reveal that it dates from 4,000 bc. they also uncovered many tools ( pictured left ) and bone fragments ( right ) last year , archaeologists discovered fragments of an 8,000 year - old charred toad leg one mile away from @entity2 in @entity7 , hinting that the @entity50 were feasting on frogs ' legs 8,000 years before the @entity53			1
the remains which were found alongside fish bones at the site are the earliest evidence of a cooked toad or frog anywhere in the world , scientists say			2
archaeologists unearthed the leg alongside small fish vertebrate bones of trout or salmon as well as burnt aurochs ' bones ( the predecessors of cows ) at the @entity6 dig site near @entity71			1
@entity30 , senior research fellow in archaeology at the @entity29 , said : ' it would appear that thousands of years ago people were eating a @entity85 - style menu on this site , one - and - a - quarter miles from @entity2 , consisting of toads ' legs , aurochs , wild boar and red deer with hazelnuts for main , another course of salmon and trout and finishing off with blackberries			1
' this is significant for our understanding of the way people were living around 5,000 years before the building of @entity2 and it begs the question - where are the frogs now ? ' experts tested charcoal that was dug up from the site , to reveal that it dates from 4,000 bc. the dig has also unearthed evidence of structures as well as proof of feasting , such as burnt flints and remains of giant bulls – aurochs – eaten by early hunter gatherers , as well as tools			1
‘ this is the latest dated @entity112 encampment ever found in the @entity113 , ’ he said			0
‘ @entity6 site connects the early hunter gatherer groups returning to @entity113 after the @entity116 to the @entity2 area , all the way through to the @entity119 in the late fifth @entity120 however , the team is concerned that it could be damaged because of plans to build an underground tunnel past @entity2			1
a 1.8 mile ( 2.9 km ) tunnel is part of a £ 2 billion plan to make the nearby @entity128 a dual carriageway			0
‘ was @entity2 built in part as a monument to the ancestors from the deepest part of @entity113 ’s past ? ’ dr @entity30 asked			1
‘ @entity6 could explain what archaeologists have been searching for for centuries – an answer to the story of @entity2 's past			1
but our only chance to find out about the earliest chapter of @entity113 ’s history could be wrecked if the tunnel goes ahead			0
’ the dig has also unearthed evidence of structures as well as proof of feasting , such as burnt flints and remains of giant bulls ( pictured ) – aurochs – eaten by early hunter gatherers , as well as tools the @entity155 said it would ‘ consult before any building ’			2
@entity157 , chairman of the @entity158 and @entity159 , said : ‘ traffic congestion to one of the country ’s most visited attractions will not be solved by a tunnel with one exit lane – the current tailback can extend five miles and can take two hours to get through			0
any tunnel would need to be motorway standard , and even with four lanes there would still be tailbacks			0
‘ concerns have been raised about the water table			0
due to the chalkland landscape the tunnel would effectively become a dam , which would change the water course , causing problems			0
‘ kilometres of chalk would have to be extracted			0
air conditioning , water pumps , lighting and maintenance costs would be colossal			0
' a much more practical solution would be to reroute the @entity128 supporting @entity7 as well as the @entity185			0
’ a previous dig at the site , led by the @entity29 , revealed @entity71 is the longest continually - occupied place in the country and that burnt frogs ’ legs from 7,000 years ago were a delicacy here long before the @entity53 took a liking to them			1
the highest density of @entity112 burnt flints and tools anywhere in the @entity113 was found in one small area at the site in a previous dig. a natural spring at @entity6 would have been the attraction for both people and animals			2
the combination of a water of a constant temperature and a rare algae also produced the only colour - changing stones , which change from brown to pink , found at any archaeological site in the country			0
professor @entity214 , of @entity215 described the findings as ‘ the most important discovery at @entity2 in over 60 years			1
’ the @entity29 has launched a @entity223 ( @entity223 ) to enable students to explore some of the reasons why archaeologosts think @entity2 was built , theories of those who built it and cultural responses to it			2
more than 1,000 people have already signed up to the @entity223 , which will also enable students to evaluate responses to @entity2 in art , literature , music , architecture and culture			0
ancient @entity38 from far and wide were drawn to @entity2 to see the area ’s pink flint and the @entity238 acted as an ‘ a-road ’ carrying people to a nearby settlement at @entity6 where feasts and tour guides were available even before the monument was built , one archaeologist claimed in may			1
it is thought that there was an established community in the area before the monument was built and that people travelled to the settlement in log boats			0
carbon dating of bones from giant bulls and boars discarded at @entity256 , @entity6 - a settlement around a mile from the monument - prove that @entity71 is the oldest settlement in @entity113 and has been continually occupied since @entity260			1
historic : the dig in @entity71 , which took place in october and was funded by the @entity29 , also unearthed the largest haul of worked flints from the @entity112 period archaeologists think that the communities that built the monument lived and worked in the area for around 3,000 years and that @entity2 was built as part of an established settlement , rather than a monument in an empty landscape			1
they have also ruled out the possibility of the monument being built by @entity278 immigrants and think the giant stones were placed by indigenous hunters and homemakers			0
the team found that mesolithic cultures cleared land around @entity6 between 7,500 and @entity285 , which they had thought was an activity previously thought to be a part of the ‘ farming package ’ brought in by @entity119 immigrants from the continent in the 5th millennium @entity294 dr @entity30 said : the area was clearly a hub point for people to come to from many miles away , and in many ways was a forerunner for what later went on at @entity2 itself			1
the first monuments at @entity2 were built by these people			0
‘ in effect , @entity6 was the very first @entity305 , up and running in the 8th millennium @entity294 @entity307 would have been the @entity308 – people would have come down on their log boats			2
‘ they would have had the equivalent of tour guides and there would have been feasting			0

carbon dating established ‘ first proof ’ of @entity6 settlement in @entity7
excavation revealed proof of permanent structure and animal bones
site indicates @entity2 could have been planned by settlers for years
further inspection of the site could ‘ rewrite @entity38 history , ’ experts say
