they have been one of the retail sensations of the @entity3 season			0
sales of @entity8 , the handheld devices on to which electronic books can be downloaded , rocketed through december			1
it is good news for makers such as @entity12 , which produces the best - selling kindle and collects 30 per cent of the price of downloaded books			1
but there are fears that their profits could be hit by a the sheer number of pirate ebooks available to download for free			2
@entity21 : one of the illegal downloads being made available for the @entity23 ( left ) is 77 shadow street by @entity24			2
it can be obtained for free from pirate sites , while those who pre-order it from @entity12 will have to pay nearly £ 12 just as pirates and websites including @entity31 undermined the music industry by putting music on the web for free , so the same is now happening with ebooks			2
an agreement between six major publishers including @entity38 and @entity39 also recently saw prices rocket for many ebooks - some of which are more expensive than the paper version			2
creating pirate copies of published books is simple and can be done using a computer and a scanner in a relatively short period of time , or by converting the file format of a ' bought ' ebook			1
freely available software which people can download to their home computers is able to convert just about any document file for reading on a kindle or other ereader			0
hitting back : publishers have asked @entity59 to demote pirate websites to make sure they do not appear at the top of web searches for free ebooks one pirate website boasts : ‘ with a @entity23 there is pretty much no protection against pirated books			1
there are programs which can simply convert any piece of text into the proper format and it will show on your @entity23 as if you had bought it ! ’ it is estimated that up to 20 per cent of @entity77 downloads are from pirate sites			1
@entity79 issued 115,000 legal threats to websites to stop them offering free pirated books in 2011 , a rise of 130 per cent on 2010			2
passwords could become a thing of the past as firms such as @entity88 develop face - recognition software to let users access their smartphones , tablets and laptops			0
the technology scans the face that is looking at the screen , picking out key features such as the distance between the eyes , the size of the nose or the shape of the lips , then comparing them to a stored image , the @entity95 blog says			0
some pcs from firms such as @entity110 and even smartphones from @entity111 already use the technology			0
hi - tech firms are racing to rescue users from the need to remember a growing store of passwords to access their technology			0
@entity88 and @entity59 are both understood to be developing facial recognition ' passwords ' - and the new version of @entity121 will include an option to circle people on screen in family photos as opposed to memorising huge strings of numbers and letters			0
publishers are in talks with the government and @entity59 to find ways to combat the trade , which breaches their copyright			1
they have asked @entity59 to demote pirate websites to ensure they do not appear at the top of web searches for consumers looking to find ebooks			2
pressure is also being put on internet service providers to shut down pirate websites			0
one of the best - known @entity77 pirate websites offers a selection of best - sellers that should not yet even be available to the public			1
one example is 77 shadow street , the new novel by @entity24			0
@entity12 customers will have to pay £ 11.96 to pre-order it – but an @entity77 and audiobook version are already available for free from the pirate site			1
the rise of the pirate @entity77 websites coincides with concern among consumers about the high price of legal book downloads			1
five big publishers , together with @entity88 , are under investigation by the @entity163 for allegedly colluding to push up the price of ebooks by as much as 50 per cent			0
many ebooks are available for as little as 99p , however a bestseller can cost more than £ 10			0
in some cases , @entity12 and @entity88 are charging more for an @entity77 download than the real book .			1
