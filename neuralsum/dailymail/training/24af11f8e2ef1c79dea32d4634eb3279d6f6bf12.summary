by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 12:01 est , 21 november 2012 updated : 13:22 est , 26 november 2012 a teaching assistant has been handed a staggering £ 800,000 in compensation after she tripped and dislocated a finger at work			1
the payout – one of the highest ever awarded in education – was made after @entity9 tripped over the waist strap of an empty wheelchair while trying to move it			0
mrs @entity9 , 49 , dislocated a finger and injured her elbow in the 2003 accident , and has since been diagnosed with ‘ reflex sympathetic dystrophy ’ – a malfunction of the nervous system that causes pain and swelling			2
mrs @entity9 's lawyer explained that she had been left in constant pain with severely restricted movement down the left side of her body			0
she is now dependent on the care of her husband			0
astronomical : @entity29 had to pay out £ 1.3 million in school compensation claims in just one year the married teaching assistant , from @entity32 , @entity33 , began a nine - year battle against her local authority for compensation , and earlier this year @entity29 agreed to pay £ 800,000 in damages and £ 140,000 in legal costs in an out - of - court settlement			1
the award , which sparked fury among war veterans and victims of crime who received substantially less for their injuries , is part of a burgeoning compensation culture among teachers who last year claimed a record £ 25million following accidents and employment disputes			1
recent payouts include £ 200,000 for slipping on a grape and £ 173,595 for dislocating an ankle during playground duty			1
a teacher who preferred to take small classes was handed £ 250,000 after being put in front of a full class , including disruptive pupils , which caused a recurrence of a nervous breakdown			2
unbelievable : @entity64 , pictured , was initially awarded just £ 18,895 after being left for dead in a frenzied knife attack			1
her mother @entity66 said the teaching assistant 's award was ' astronomical ' yet classroom unions which helped secure the payouts have been vocal in their attacks on spiralling compensation claims from parents who resort to lawyers when their children fall in the playground or have accidents on school trips			1
@entity33 council leader @entity79 said yesterday the award was a ‘ sad reflection on the litigious society we have become ’			1
@entity66 , the mother of a teenager who was stabbed 35 times and left for dead in a frenzied unprovoked attack in 2010 , condemned the payout			0
@entity64 , now 16 , suffered injuries so severe she suffered a stroke and was in a coma for weeks			0
but the @entity92 – which can offer victims up to £ 250,000 – awarded her just £ 18,895			1
the family appealed and received a larger payout , but it was still ‘ substantially ’ less than the award to mrs @entity9			0
ms @entity66 , from @entity32 , @entity33 , said : ‘ @entity98 did n’t even get a quarter of that sum			1
it is unbelievable , astronomical			2
something that can change your life for ever gets a measly sum			0
’ war hero @entity105 , who lost both legs and his right arm in a bomb blast in @entity109 , added : ‘ it is bad because we are going out there and our lives can change just like that			0
it is unfair – we are doing a more dangerous job			2
’ mrs @entity9 ’s payout was one of 12 to school staff in @entity33 alone last year , costing taxpayers more than £ 1.3million			1
other payments included £ 42,000 to a teacher who pushed a door which did not open , resulting in concussion and an arm injury			2
the council also had to pay £ 26,713 in costs			1
figures from the three main classroom unions show they secured £ 25million in compensation for members last year			1
most of the cash was paid out following employment disputes , but there were also significant personal injury payouts , including £ 158,000 for slipping on mud during a fire drill			1
many cases never reached court but were settled using ‘ compromise agreements ’ – legal agreements to accept compensation rather than pursue a tribunal claim			0
employment payouts included £ 33,000 to a teacher who was fired for gross misconduct amid allegations she falsified test results , albeit in optional tests			1
the school ‘ failed to provide any evidence the member ’s actions had been deliberate ’			2
in another case , a teacher with serious criminal convictions dating back 20 years – before she started teaching – was fired after the local council discovered the offences			2
a tribunal awarded her £ 35,500			2
the growing payouts culture is thought to be partly driven by schools and local authorities settling out of court to minimise their losses , sometimes without properly investigating the claims			1
and the size and number of payouts have prompted accusations of double standards after unions criticised litigious parents			2
in the past , the @entity175 union has lamented that ‘ society no longer appears to accept the concept of a genuine accident ’ and condemned the ‘ rise of the blame culture ’			0
it is believed mrs @entity9 has been unable to work since the accident			0
she lives with husband @entity183 and two children from a previous marriage in a £ 200,000 semi-detached home in a residential estate			0
@entity29 said the cost to the authority was £ 100,000 – the rest was covered by its employer ’s liability insurance			1
mr @entity79 added : ‘ we contested this case but liability was decided by the courts			0
‘ it is a sad reflection on the litigious society we have become			0
there seems to be no such thing as an accident any more ; everything is argued to be someone ’s fault			0
’ @entity206 , of the @entity207 ’ @entity205 , said : ‘ every penny spent on settling these claims means less money spent on educating children			0
’ the compensation details were released as part of a @entity215 request .			0

was one of 12 payouts to school staff in @entity33 that cost taxpayers £ 1.3 million in one year
victims of crime and injured *soldiers* say the amount is ' unfair ' and ' unbelievable '
