unusual surroundings : it is believed that someone dumped both marsupials in @entity23 and that they made their way to the famous cemetery ' people are coming here to pay their respects to deceased relatives and friends and we felt a wallaby could perhaps be a distraction , it was a matter of balance			0
' we have plenty of bird life , hedgehogs , spiders - they may not be as attention grabbing as a wallaby but we felt the cemetery was n’t a really good long - term home			0
' it was unusual having her around , and i can understand why people were so enthused			0
i ’m sure the staff and volunteers here will miss her			0
