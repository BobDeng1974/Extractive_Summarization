by @entity0 city leaders are hoping to build a whole village of wooden sheds to solve a homelessness crisis which is one of the worst in the @entity6 two rival candidates for mayor in @entity9 , @entity10 , have teamed up to demand dozens of ' microhouses ' costing $ 5,000 each complete with doors , windows , insulation and electrics			1
the idea had full support from one shed shop owner - though he admitted his high - end builds were usually used as home offices			0
two sheds are better than one : two political rivals in @entity9 , @entity10 , have joined forces to house the city 's 7,000 - strong homeless population in wooden ' microhouses '			1
the idea has been used elsewhere in the @entity6 village : some of the types of units which could be used - even though these usually become home offices @entity32 , who runs @entity33 in nearby @entity34 , told @entity35 : ' these are made just like a little house would be made '			1
there would be no running water in the homes and occupiers would have to share a communal bathroom			2
but mr @entity32 insisted the wooden sheds would be ' very livable ' with a solid two - by - four construction - and some even have @entity45 windows			0
the idea was put forward by rival city council members @entity48 and @entity49 and is far from new			0
in @entity51 , high school construction students are building ' micro-cottages ' for as little as $ 3,000 each and there is already a micro-cottage community in @entity55 , @entity56			2
home comforts : the sheds include insulation and built - in electrical wiring , but no running water or toilets @entity32 , who runs @entity33 in nearby @entity34 , insisted the buildings would be very livable metal shipping containers , meanwhile , have been turned into affordable housing in @entity66 , student accommodation in @entity68 and even a boutique guest house in @entity70 , @entity71			2
but the need is especially dire in @entity9 , whose leaders say it has one of @entity6 's highest numbers of unsheltered homeless people			1
campaigners say there are 7,000 homeless people in @entity9 , a city which has been hit by soaring rents			1
a modest apartment is only affordable to those earning around $ 30 an hour or more , three times the minimum wage in @entity10			2
the report by the rival politicians suggested putting up to 30 of the huts at a time on vacant land or in empty warehouses			0
thinking outside the box : metal shipping containers have surged in popularity , including this guest house which was created for an artist in @entity70 , @entity71 , who wanted to experiment with architects they insisted it would be a short - term move and residents would be encouraged to move to more solid homes once their lives are back on track			0
' we have become painfully aware that @entity9 has one of the largest unsheltered homeless populations in the @entity6 ' , the report said			1
' in a city of very scarce public resources , and a challenge as daunting as homelessness , we must be more resourceful ' ' a tiny house is a relatively inexpensive short - term housing option for the homeless			0
' placed together on underutilized land , a collection of very small , economically cheap houses can become a tiny village that can be managed and maintained , offering another humane option for housing our vulnerable homeless population while long term housing options are sought			1
' in a city of very scarce public resources , and a challenge as daunting as homelessness , we must continue to press to be more resourceful , more creative , and more innovative with our public dollars			0
' @entity128 may serve as a critical option for doing so ' .			0

@entity9 among worst cities in @entity6 for number of rough *sleepers*
