by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 7 march 2014 updated : 19:15 est , 7 march 2014 @entity2 has written to every @entity4 season - ticket holder admitting he is ' desperate to compensate ' for the dismal start to his reign			1
and he has again been forced to deny that @entity7 is increasingly disillusioned at @entity8			1
@entity2 ’s stance follows comments from former @entity12 star @entity11 that the striker is ‘ not enjoying the football @entity4 are playing ’ and will be off at the end of the season unless major signings are made			1
the @entity4 manager , whose plea for patience in his ‘ difficult ’ first season has received a mixed reaction on social media , denied @entity24 is unhappy at @entity4 and that there are divisions in his squad			1
the controversy over @entity24 , which began following the shock 2 - 0 @entity31 defeat at @entity32 when he told a @entity34 tv station that team - mates were running into his space , intensified with @entity38 ’s remarks			1
but @entity2 hit back , saying : ‘ have i a reaction to what @entity7 said after @entity32 ? do you know the whole transcript ? read it out in full and i will answer your question			1
apology : @entity2 has written a letter ( below ) to every @entity4 season ticket holder appologising for the team 's poor form this season unrest : @entity7 continues to grow disillusioned with life at @entity8 ' look at the whole transcript , rather than that one bit that has been picked out			1
i have — and i have no issue with it whatsoever			2
when you hear it in full , you see what he is getting at and i understand totally where he was coming from			2
‘ i travelled back with him from the @entity12 game the other night			0
i went to the game against @entity63 and then travelled back with him			0
‘ if anyone is suggesting certain players are not playing for me , i do n’t know if that is the right thing			1
‘ i think they definitely are , so i do n’t accept that			0
i ’ve been honest with the players and the media and tried to be as straight as i can			2
‘ i ’ve done it with the supporters as well and admitted we need to play better			0
poor : @entity2 admitted the @entity32 debacle was the poorest his team have played we 've been here before : sir @entity77 sent a letter to @entity4 fans in 1989 ‘ i think @entity32 was the poorest we ’ve played			1
it was disappointing , but we will improve			2
‘ the idea of the letter was simply that i was asked to put out something to the supporters and it was just to say , here we are — this is how it ’s gone about			2
‘ but i think most @entity4 supporters totally understand the situation and they ’ve shown that with their support and their backing wherever i ’ve been — not just at @entity8 but everywhere that i go			1
‘ i ’ve been to a lot of games all over the world recently and all the @entity4 followers i have bumped into have been supportive and shown they understand we ’re having a difficult season			2
‘ they ’re looking forward to it getting better			0
’ chance : @entity4 will have to pick up three points against @entity99 's struggling @entity98 @entity100 : the @entity102 - @entity24 partnership is not flourishing this season in his letter , @entity2 said he ‘ firmly believed ’ @entity4 would re-emerge as title contenders , particularly if they can turn @entity8 into a ‘ fortress ’ once more , but admitted : ‘ the difficult season we have experienced was not something that i envisaged			1
’ with @entity4 seventh in the @entity109 — 12 points off a @entity31 place — finding a way of rekindling @entity24 ’s stuttering partnership with @entity102 might help , starting at struggling @entity98			0
one person who is leaving @entity4 this summer is captain @entity115			0
moving on : @entity115 will leave @entity8 in the summer and join @entity116 @entity116 announced on thursday that @entity115 had agreed to move to the @entity118 club at the end of the season , and @entity2 was annoyed at the timing of the announcement			1
@entity2 said : ' i do n't think we like it in this country			1
i do n't think it 's something that 's done here			0
' i can think of [ @entity129 ] @entity128 going to @entity130			0
i can think of [ @entity132 ] @entity131 , who went last year between two of the biggest clubs in @entity135			0
it 's not something we like in this country , it 's done more often elsewhere			0
' but it 's happened and we 'll get on with it			0
@entity143 has been a brilliant servant for the club and we 'll treat him with all the respect he deserves			0
i knew about january time that this would probably be his choice			0
