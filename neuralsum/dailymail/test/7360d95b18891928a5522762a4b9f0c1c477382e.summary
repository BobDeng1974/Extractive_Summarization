@entity1 midfielder @entity0 is relishing the prospect of a long - awaited @entity4 appearance after injury robbed him of the chance three years ago			1
the @entity7 made three trips to the national stadium in 2012 after winning the @entity10 and losing the @entity11 to @entity12 , but the @entity13 international missed all of them with a serious knee injury sustained in the previous november			2
but having played his part in the 1 - 0 quarter - final win at @entity20 , @entity0 is hoping to get his chance in the last - four encounter with @entity23 on april 19			1
@entity0 ( right ) celebrates with @entity1 manager @entity24 after getting to the @entity11 semi-final @entity0 ( left ) challenges @entity26 as @entity1 beat @entity20 1 - 0 in the @entity11 quarter - final replay @entity0 can play his first game at @entity4 in a @entity1 shirt when they meet @entity23 in the semi-final ' unfortunately i got an injury before we got to @entity4 so i missed [ the chance to play there ] , ' he said			1
' hopefully i 'll be fit and be able to play at @entity4			2
i 've never played there , so it will be a very good experience and after many years here , to have that chance is amazing			0
' i think everyone could see how hard we worked			0
we knew it was going to be a very hard game in difficult conditions , but i think we did well and we are so happy to get to @entity4 and hopefully get to the final			2
' victory over @entity20 intensified talk of the team giving captain @entity50 , who departs for @entity51 , the perfect send - off as his birthday falls on the day of the final			1
however , the midfielder was suspended for the tie at @entity56 and it was @entity0 's compatriot @entity58 who made the difference with a 70th - minute strike , having scored a brilliant last - minute winner in a fourth - round replay at @entity63			2
@entity58 has arguably been @entity1 's best player over the last five months having not only finally seemed to have grown in stature as a playmaker but also adding goals to his armoury			1
' i have known him for a very long time and i know what he 's capable of doing , ' @entity0 told liverpoolfc.com			2
' he 's becoming an even bigger player for the club and he 's got a long way to go in terms of age and experience , but he 's already right there with the top players			0
' another player whose form has taken a significant upturn during that period is goalkeeper @entity82 , who produced two excellent saves to keep a clean sheet against @entity20 and even stopped opposite number @entity85 scoring what would have been the most dramatic of equalisers after the @entity20 keeper came up for a throw - in in added time			1
the @entity92 international has overcome his early - season wobbles when he seemed to be the cause of much of @entity1 's defensive frailties			1
he admits victory over @entity20 was important after back - to - back @entity98 defeats put a huge dent in their @entity102 aspirations			1
' after the result against @entity105 there was n't much time to think because we knew there was going to be a game on wednesday , ' @entity82 said			0
' so we had to recover well , put the focus to @entity20 and then make sure that we did the things we wanted to do			0
' i think the lads and the team responded really well , did their jobs and did what the gaffer asked us to do , and we managed to get the result we wanted			0
' we needed to bounce back after two disappointing results against @entity120 and @entity105 and we did that			0
' we gave something back to the fans , who have got something to look forward to now as well with a trip to @entity4			0
@entity58 ( right ) scored the decisive goal for @entity1 , drilling a low shot in off the far post @entity82 ( left ) produced another commanding display in goal for @entity1 at @entity56 @entity131 praised the @entity1 supporters and is targeting reaching the final of the @entity11 ' they stand behind us at every single away game , they turn up in numbers and it 's always nice to play in front of that crowd			1
' they pushed us forward and they have something to look forward to now with a big game at @entity4			0
hopefully we can get to the final as well			0
' as a result of @entity1 's semi-final involvement their league match at @entity147 scheduled for that weekend has been rescheduled for tuesday , april 28 at the @entity150 .			1

@entity0 was injured for @entity1 's three @entity4 games in 2012
he hopes to feature in the semi-final against @entity23 on april 19
@entity82 believes victory over @entity20 vital after two defeats
