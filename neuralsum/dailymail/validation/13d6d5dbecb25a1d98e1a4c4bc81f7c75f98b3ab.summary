police are seeking an attempted murder charge against the crazed activist they say slashed the @entity5 ambassador to @entity6 while screaming demands for @entity9 reunification			1
the attack thursday on @entity11 , which prompted rival @entity9 to gloat about ' knife slashes of justice , ' left deep gashes and damaged tendons and nerves			1
it also raised questions about security in a city normally seen as ultra-safe , despite regular threats of war from @entity25			0
while an extreme example , the attack is the latest act of political violence in a deeply divided country where some protesters portray their causes as matters of life and death			0
doctors will remove the 80 stiches on @entity11 's face on monday or tuesday and expect him to be out of the hospital by tuesday or wednesday			1
hospital officials say he may experience sensory problems in his left hand for several months			0
police , meanwhile , searched the offices of the suspect , @entity45 for documents and computer files as they investigated how the attack was planned and whether others were involved dumbfounded : @entity45 was arrested in the immediate aftermath of the attack on @entity11 on thursday morning , which left the ambassador covered in blood in custody : the 55 - year - old @entity45 reportedly yelled ' @entity9 and @entity6 should be unified ' before he attacked ambassador @entity11 at the breakfast meeting			1
seen above being taken into custody on thursday journalists question @entity45 , who was brought out in a wheelchair , as he left the police station for a court in @entity42 earlier today they want to charge @entity45 with attempted murder , violence against a foreign envoy and business obstruction , and have requested a formal detention warrant			1
a further charge of violating @entity6 's @entity91 , which bans @entity6 from publicly sympathising with the @entity9 government , was being considered			2
but the 55 - year - old has denied that he intended to kill @entity11			1
as part of their investigation they have also requested @entity45 's past travels to @entity9 — seven times between 1999 and 2007 — during a previous era of @entity102 cooperation , when @entity42 was ruled by a liberal government			1
@entity45 attempted to build a memorial altar for former @entity9 leader @entity106 after his death in december 2011 , police said			1
protest : @entity6 officials responded swiftly in response to the attacks , beefing up security outside the @entity112 and promising justice			0
above , a group of @entity6 protesters burn @entity9 flags in @entity42 during a rally denouncing the attack on thursday pro-american : while @entity6 is one of @entity5 's strongest allies in @entity123 , there are factions of the country that are against the strong @entity5 military presence			1
above , more @entity5 - @entity6 alliance supporters pictured above on thursday against the @entity128 : @entity6 protesters shout slogans as they hold the photos of @entity9 leader @entity131 , center and right , the late leaders @entity106 , second from left , and @entity135 , left , during a rally denouncing the attack on the @entity5 ambassador on thursday @entity45 , who has a long history of anti- @entity5 protests , said he acted alone in the attack on @entity11			1
he told police it was meant as a protest of annual @entity5 - @entity6 military drills that started monday — exercises that the @entity146 has long maintained are preparations for an invasion			1
@entity45 said the drills , which @entity42 and @entity150 say are purely defensive , ruined efforts for reconciliation between the @entity153 , according to police officials			0
while most @entity6 look at the @entity5 presence favorably , @entity5 infuriates some leftists because of its role in @entity6 's turbulent modern history			2
@entity150 , which backed the @entity6 during the 1950 - 53 @entity159 against the communist @entity146 , still stations 28,500 troops here , and anti- @entity5 activists see the annual military drills with @entity42 as a major obstacle to their goal of a unified @entity6			1
' @entity6 and @entity9 should be reunified , ' @entity45 shouted as he slashed @entity11 with a 10 - inch knife , police and witnesses said			1
right before : @entity11 pictured above , seated at the breakfast table just prior to being attacked by @entity45 thursday morning stained : police say the ambassador was at his table and about to make a speech when @entity45 pushed him from behind and then started slashing him with a knife			1

doctors say he needed 80 stitches for the wound on his face @entity6 protection : @entity6 police patrol outside the @entity112 in @entity42 on march 5			1
the protection of foreign dignitaries and embassies is customarily the responsibility of the host country @entity45 is well - known among police and activists as one of a hard - core group of protesters willing to use violence to highlight their causes			2
police did n't consider the possibility that @entity45 , who has ties to the @entity208 , which hosted the breakfast meeting where @entity11 was attacked , would show up for the event , according to a @entity42 police official who did n't want to be named , citing office rules			1
@entity5 ambassadors have security details , but their size largely depends on the threat level of the post			0
@entity42 is not considered to be a particularly high threat post despite its proximity to the @entity9 border			0
it 's not clear how many guards @entity11 had , but they would have been fewer than the ambassadors in most of the @entity225			0
outspoken : @entity45 reportedly has a history of public outbursts			0
pictured above in an undated file photo from a prior protest @entity42 's @entity230 said it was the first time a foreign ambassador stationed in modern @entity6 had been injured in a violent attack			1
however , the @entity235 ambassador narrowly escaped injury in 2010 when @entity45 threw a piece of concrete at him , according to police			2
@entity45 , who was protesting @entity235 's claim to small disputed islands that are occupied by @entity6 , hit the ambassador 's secretary instead , media reports said , and was sentenced to a three - year suspended prison term over the attack			1
the website of the @entity249 activist group that @entity45 heads describes the group 's long history of anti- @entity5 protests			2
photos show him and other activists rallying last week in front of the @entity112 in @entity42 to protest the @entity5 - @entity6 military drills , which are to run until the end of april			1
@entity9 's state - controlled media crowed thursday that @entity45 's ' knife slashes of justice ' were ' a deserved punishment on war maniac @entity5 ' and reflected the @entity6 people 's protests against the @entity5 for driving the @entity265 to the brink of war because of the joint military drills			1
@entity5 secretary of state @entity269 , in @entity270 for meetings with regional leaders , said the @entity5 ' will never be intimidated or deterred by threats or by anybody who harms any @entity5 diplomats			0
' activists in @entity42 , meanwhile , expressed worries that the attack on @entity11 would harm the public image of peaceful protesters , or prompt the conservative government to suppress their activities			0
small to medium - sized demonstrations regularly occur across @entity42 , and most are peaceful			0
but scuffles with police do break out occasionally , and the burning of effigies of @entity9 and @entity235 leaders is also common			0
some demonstrators have also severed their own fingers , thrown bodily fluids at embassies and tried to self - immolate			0
@entity11 became ambassador last october and has been a regular presence on social media and in speeches and presentations during his time in @entity42			0
he 's regularly seen walking his @entity300 , @entity301 , near his residence , not far from where the attack happened			0
his wife gave birth here and the couple gave their son a @entity9 middle name			0
while @entity6 is one of the @entity5 's closest @entity123 allies , @entity5 has been partially blamed for the severing of @entity6 into two countries			2
in 1910 , the @entity316 took control of unified @entity6 which they ruled as a colony through the end of @entity321 when the @entity322 fell in 1945 , it was decided in a @entity324 agreement that @entity6 be split in half at the 38th parallel			0
the @entity5 established a trusteeship in the south while the @entity329 took over in the north , leading to the creation in 1948 of two separate countries			0
above , @entity5 troops board a boat bound for @entity6 at the onset of the @entity159 in 1950 however , both sides thought the situation was temporary that that their respective country would ultimately become the sole head of unified @entity6			2
@entity341 tensions between the @entity5 and @entity329 only fueled these ambitions , and in 1950 the @entity9 army invaded the south backed by @entity346 and @entity329 soldiers			2
while the @entity6 nearly lost the war in just the first few months of battle , the @entity5 helped booster their forces and retake their land			2
the fighting was disasterous for both countries , which eventually agreed to an armistance in july 1953			0
since the @entity159 is technically ongoing , the @entity5 keeps troops in @entity6 at the ready			2
however , the strong @entity5 military presence in @entity6 has led to negative sentiments from some citizens who oppose reliance on the @entity359			0
still , @entity6 remains one of the most pro-american populations in the world			0
according to a 2013 poll , 77 per cent of @entity6 surveyed said they approved of president @entity366 's leadership - compared to just 45 per cent of @entity5 at the same time .			2
