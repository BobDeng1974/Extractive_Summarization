he has been painted by history as a wicked hunchback , but @entity3 kept the disease that curved his spine secret through out his life , a historian has claimed			1
the last @entity8 king of @entity9 was described by @entity10 as a ' poisonous bunch - back 'd toad ' in his play depicting the monarch			2
but research on the king 's skeleton discovered under a council car park in @entity19 revealed that this may have been an exaggeration of a spine deformity known as scoliosis			1
dr @entity35 , from the @entity19 's school of @entity9 , said tailoring and specially fitted armour probably helped to disguise the curve in his spine			1
the genetic analysis showed that @entity3 almost certainly had blue eyes and likely had blonde hair - although it may have darkened with age			0
@entity3 was depicted by @entity10 as a tyrannical hunchback who murdered two princes in the @entity50			2
but scans of the king 's skeleton show he was n't a hunchback , but only had a slight deformity that would have barely affected his appearance or prowess on the field of battle			1
the notorious description by @entity10 of a ‘ hunchback toad ’ , a machiavellian villain suffering a twisted body , a limp and withered arm , was almost certainly an attempt to blacken his reputation , experts claim			2
instead , a 3d reconstruction of the king ’s spine shows 65 to 85 degrees of ‘ scoliosis ’ , or sideways bending of his spine to the right			0
the condition , which would have developed in his early teens , means he was very far from being a hunchback			0
despite having one shoulder slightly higher than the other and a short trunk in comparison with his arms and legs , there is no evidence he walked with a limp			0
she said : ' it is highly likely that @entity3 took care to control his public image			0
' the body of the king was part of the propaganda of power , and even when it was revealed in order to be anointed as part of his coronation ceremony it was simultaneously concealed from the congregation			0
' @entity107 probably kept the signs of his scoliosis hidden to spectators outside the royal household of attendants , servants and medical staff who dressed , bathed and tended to the monarch 's body			0
' writing in the journal @entity120 , dr @entity35 argues that like other monarchs @entity3 's body image would have been carefully controlled			1
it was only after his death at the battle of @entity126 in 1485 that his physical shape was made public when his corpse was stripped and displayed			0
dr @entity35 said that it was this treatment that later led to his reputation as a hunchback - something that was later picked up by @entity10			1
she said were no surviving descriptions of @entity3 's distinctive physique from during his lifetime			2
instead she says that his appearance became increasingly distorted through out the tudor period			0
dr @entity35 said : ' stage history has reincarnated @entity3 as monster , villain and clown , but recent events have helped us to re-evaluate these physically defined depictions and strip back the cultural accretions that have surrounded his body			1
this reconstruction of @entity3 , based on his skull , has revealed what the king looked like 500 years ago scientists studying the skull of @entity3 ( above ) found he had suffered several brutal blows before he died scientists used 3d scanning to reconstruct how @entity3 's ( right ) skeleton may have been deformed ( left ) ' the care he in all probability received for his scoliosis from his surgically trained physician was large in scale : traction and manual manipulation needed specially designed equipment , space and assistants			1
' yet , it may have been only a relatively small group of people in @entity3 's trusted circle who knew of his condition			1
the absence of contemporary testimony does not prove this , however			0
' what is certain is that , after his death , the exposure of @entity3 's body went beyond the two days of its exhibition in @entity19			1
' that moment after @entity126 inaugurated a longer and more brutalising process , in which an ever - more twisted physique was revealed to the public eye , his own body becoming deployed as a major tactic in the rhetorical strategy against him			0
the skeleton of @entity3 , with the curve in his spine clearly visible , was found under a car park in @entity19 ' when @entity10 's @entity3 boasts of his shape - changing potential , he registers too the bending course of history and myth making			1
' analysis of @entity3 's skeleton , which was discovered buried in a shallow grave at the site of @entity198 in @entity19 in 2012 , showed that many depictions of the king 's appearance had been exaggerated			1
a 3d reconstruction of his spine showed that it had 65 to 85 degrees of scoliosis - a sideways bend of his spine to the right			0
the condition would have developed in his early teens , but was far from being a hunchback			0
the scientists at the @entity19 who examined the skeleton said there was also little evidence that the king would have walked with a limp			2
however , there are some that point to the alleged murder of @entity3 's nephews @entity221 and @entity222 - the so called @entity223 - as evidence of the king 's character			1
they say this act of infanticide is what earned the @entity8 king his blackened reputation rather than his physical appearance			0
the blow that killed @entity3 in battle was so powerful that it went up through the base of his brain and left an indentation on the inside of his skull , scientists studying his remains have revealed			2
forensic pathologists at @entity19 , discovered two wounds at the base of the king 's skull along with a large indentation inside the cranium			2
the findings suggest that a weapon such as a sword or a spike had been thrust upwards through the base of the king 's neck so hard that it had gone straight through his brain to the other side of his skull			2
genetic analysis of the battle scarred skeleton , discovered under a council car park in @entity19 three years ago , has confirmed that it did belong to @entity3 scientists studying the remains believe the king was surrounded by a mob of enemy soldiers and hacked to death after he had lost his helmet			1
using modern medical scanners , they established that the @entity9 monarch suffered 11 devastating injuries at the @entity126 in 1485 .			0

historian dr @entity35 believes @entity3 used good tailoring and clever armour to hide the scoliosis in his spine that curved to the right
she argues his condition only *emerged* when he was stripped after death
scientists who examined @entity3 's skeleton say the king was far from being the hunchback portrayed by @entity10 in his plays
dr @entity35 says the king 's name was probably blackened after death in battle
