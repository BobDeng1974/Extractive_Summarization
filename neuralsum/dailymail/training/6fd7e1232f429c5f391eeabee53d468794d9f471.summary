a university match took a bizarre turn , after a streaker was on the pitch for a number of minutes , culminating in tackling a player and sparking a mass brawl			1
the match between @entity8 and @entity9 was coming to an end when the man , whose identity is not known , wandered on to the pitch with no clothes on			2
after lining up on the wing for @entity9 , he tackled a @entity8 player to the ground to rapturous applause at @entity19			1
the naked man ran onto the pitch at @entity19 during the match between @entity8 and @entity9 after lining himself up with @entity9 , the prankster made a tackle on an opposition player but the incident incensed the @entity8 players , who quickly pounced on him , and within seconds players from opposing teams started fighting , leaving the streaker able to make a quick exit without really getting caught up in the scuffle			1
the fight resulted in a yellow card for @entity9 's @entity38 hooker @entity37 , but they held on to win 29 - 10			0
@entity41 international rugby player @entity40 said : ' i ’ve played a lot of rugby , but i ’ve never seen anything like this before			0
' the guy had so much time on the pitch , about 4 minutes to do what he wanted ! ' the atmosphere was pretty good in the stadium as you ’d expect between two rival universities , but when he ran on , it got even more charged - it was so entertaining			0
' he lined up as if he belonged there as @entity9 ’s 16th man , crouched down on his knees			2
then as the ball came near him , he executed a textbook tackle on the @entity8 kid ! as the two teams fall into a pitch - side scuffle , the prankster makes a quick exit before coming to any harm the practical joke was filmed by a spectator who said he had never seen anything like it before ' then there was just a massive rumble between the two teams - @entity8 were probably a bit annoyed at the extra defence that @entity9 suddenly had ! ' i was watching it with some of the @entity79 boys and we found it hilarious - we had no idea where the security was though			1
' eventually , play was resumed , with @entity9 running out 29 - 10 winners to continue their good form over their arch rivals .			0
