mr @entity10 is one of only eight people in the world with @entity16 syndrome , which means that since the age of 12 he has been unable to store fat under his skin or even on the soles of his feet			1
mr @entity10 is a para-cyclist who is hoping to representing @entity25 in the 2016 olympics he also has just 40 per cent of the muscles of an average man and has poor hearing			1
surprisingly , mr @entity10 also suffers from type 2 diabetes - a disease usually associated with obesity			1
miss @entity9 , who works for custom bike experts @entity33 , travelled from @entity35 , where she was then a student , all the way to mr @entity10 ’s hometown , @entity38 , for their first date			1
she said : ‘ we had clicked instantly online , he was so easy to talk to			0
he told me about his condition and i ’d seen a few pictures of him but i did n’t really know what he really looked like until i met him in person			2
‘ i remember being worried - like any first date - but i wanted an adventure			2
‘ it was odd to see him in real life			0
his appearance did take me by surprise and he was much taller than i had expected			0
’ mr @entity10 is one of only eight people in the world with @entity16 syndrome , which means that since the age of 12 he has been unable to store fat under his skin or even on the soles of his feet mr @entity10 also has just 40 per cent of the muscles of an average man and has poor hearing meaning that he has to wear hearing aids she added : ‘ initially , i was self - conscious because people were staring at @entity10 but he did n’t let it bother him and he instantly put me at ease			1
‘ he was so friendly and we talked for hours over a meal at the local pub. it was just like any normal first date			0
’ miss @entity9 says the pair are just like any normal couple - apart from the fact that they do n’t go clubbing or out for late night drinking sessions			1
mr @entity10 explained : ‘ i do n’t like walking and i ca n’t stand for long periods because of my condition			1
even without it , though , i do n’t think i ’d be very good at clubbing			0
i ’m a professional athlete so need to keep healthy			0
’ surprisingly , mr @entity10 also suffers from type 2 diabetes - a disease usually associated with obesity - because he has unusually high fat levels in his blood ms @entity9 says that she was self - conscious when she first started going out with mr @entity10 because people would stare at him but that he soon put her at ease with his friendly conversation scientists at the @entity91 have recently discovered that mr @entity10 ’s condition stems from a genetic mutation			1
the new discovery may , in time , help other sufferers with the syndrome			2
however , the six foot three inch tall cyclist , who weighs 66 kilos , says he has never let his condition hold him back			2
and he has already proved that it is possible to live a normal life			0
the law graduate has already been crowned the @entity102 and dreams of winning gold at the @entity105 in @entity106			0
ms @entity9 says the pair are just like any normal couple - apart from the fact that they do n't go clubbing or out for late night drinking sessions because mr @entity10 has to concentrate on his cycling career ms @entity9 said : ‘ living with @entity10 i ’ve had to learn about what he eats			1
he has to have a controlled diet because of his diabetes and metabolism			2
‘ but that ’s about it - he does most of the cooking and shopping and i just go along to pick out the cakes			2
’ she says they ’ve been together long enough to know each other inside out			0
she said : ‘ when i look in to my future i see @entity10 there			1
we ’ve been together so long that we know each other ’s strengths and weaknesses and i do n’t think there would ever be anything that would get in the way of that			0
mr @entity10 ( right , at the age of nine ) recently learned that his condition stems from a genetic mutation thanks to a breakthrough by scientists at @entity91 ‘ now i do n’t even notice the stares we occasionally get when we go out - @entity10 is n’t out of the ordinary at all			1
’ mr @entity10 added : ‘ i am very , very fortunate to have @entity142			1
that ’s all i can say really			0
i ’m very lucky to have her			0
’ the cyclist was born at a normal weight , but throughout his childhood and teenage years lost all the fat around his face and limbs			2
his condition means he has no natural cushioning on his body , suffers from sore feet , and is at an increased risk of breaking bones in a fall			1
mr @entity10 ( pictured at the age of five ) was born at a normal weight , but throughout his childhood and teenage years lost all the fat around his face and limbs because of the disorder , @entity10 has unusually high fat levels in his blood , as if he was obese			1
it is this that has led to him developing diabetes			0
his hearing also deteriorated during childhood , and he now wears hearing aids			0
@entity10 hopes the new diagnosis will allow him to be more accurately classified for events and help his chances of success			1
he is bidding to participate in the @entity171			0
he said : ' in some ways , identifying the syndrome behind my symptoms should n't be important - a name is just a name , after all - but it is reassuring to know that there are other people with the condition and that we can lead relatively normal lives , ' he said			1
ms @entity9 said : ' when i look in to my future i see @entity10 there			1
we 've been together so long that we know each other very well			0
i do n't think there would ever be anything that would get in the way of that ' ‘ what could prove crucial , though , is enabling me to be properly classified in competitions so that i am not competing at an unfair disadvantage against others			0
' i hope to be able to compete for @entity195 in the 2016 paralympics and this finding could make a real difference to my chances			0
' professor @entity200 , a @entity201 senior investigator , said : ' @entity203 condition has been a puzzle to us for many years			0
we could see the symptoms , including the very unusual case of type 2 diabetes in someone with no obvious body fat , but did not know what was causing them			1
' we had to look at 30 million base pairs ( chemical components of @entity215 ) in @entity10 's dna , and similar numbers in his family members and other patients , to identify the single mutation			2
this would not have been feasible even a couple of years ago			0

@entity9 , 23 , is in a relationship with para-cyclist @entity10 , 24
mr @entity10 is one of only eight in the world to have @entity16 syndrome
the condition causes him to be be unable to store fat under the skin giving
also means he only has 40 *%* of the muscle an average man would have
surprisingly , it also causes type 2 diabetes - a condition normally associated with obesity
