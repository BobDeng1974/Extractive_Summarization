by @entity1 reporter published : 08:48 est , 1 september 2013 updated : 10:57 est , 1 september 2013 a @entity3 photographer whose twin brother was born with cerebral palsy uses the camera lens to help come to terms with being born the healthy twin			1
@entity9 has documented his brother @entity11 ’s life and its struggles for the last thirteen years and the collection of black and white photos will soon be published as a book			1
the collection , titled @entity17 , is both a brother ’s touching tribute and @entity9 ’s attempt to come to terms with the reality his brother lives and one from which he happened to be spared			1
twins : the distance between @entity27 is @entity29 's attempt to sort out what it means to be the twin who was born healthy ‘ the question i always asked myself as a child , and even sometimes now as an adult , is why did this happen to @entity11 and not me , ’ @entity9 writes on a @entity34 campaign page dedicated to help get his book published			1
‘ why does this happen to anyone ? the pictures ended up forcing me to deal with these questions			0
’ @entity9 has happily reached a fundraising goal of $ 16,000 and has stretched his goal to $ 25,000			0
along with @entity48 - based publisher @entity46 , @entity9 is hoping to offset the cost of telling his story in book form			0
‘ for years , ’ writes @entity9 , ‘ i archived the pictures without ever looking at many of them			0
about ten years after the first pictures were made , and with a growing pile of photographs , i started to question why i continued to make these pictures			0
’ looking for answers ? @entity9 's brother @entity11 , pictured , was born with cerebral palsy while @entity9 was born healthy and @entity17 asks the questions , why ? in @entity17 , @entity64 documents his brother 's ups and downs in stark black and white brothers : the @entity3 - based photographer calls his work a story of two brothers , not just a story about cerebral palsy the photos primarily focus on @entity11			1
he 's seen struggling to perform everyday tasks , but also triumphing in ways large and smalll lighting a cigarette for a pretty girl is one of @entity11 's triumphs thus was born the distance between us			1
photos of @entity11 are as uplifting as they are unflinching in their portrayal of @entity11 ’s reality , one in which painful cramps and struggles to perform everyday tasks are commonplace			2
whether his brother is lighting a pretty girl ’s cigarette or taking communion at church , @entity9 finds a way to convey @entity11 ’s struggles and his triumphs			1
though it is n’t @entity11 ’s illness that @entity9 is most interested in			2
painful : the cerebral palsy causes @entity11 debilitating muscle cramps that can last from hours to days ' @entity11 's countenance changes when a spasm is coming , ' writes @entity9			1
' even before his body goes rigid			0
' ' in november 2009 , @entity11 had @entity105			2
' @entity106 is cutting edge science but it look like medieval torture , ' writes @entity9 ‘ it had little to do with showing what it is like to live with cerebral palsy , ’ he says , ‘ and more to do with sharing our story as brothers , and being open about my laments , and sharing how i began to move past the guilt i carried for being the healthy twin			0
’ the project has also allowed @entity9 to place his focus on the future			0
‘ the pictures have unexpectedly begun to help me move past my own grief , past my fears , and past our family to find out what lies ahead for @entity11 and me , ’ he writes			2
‘ i do n’t know how the future will look , but soon it will be just ours to figure out			0
’ going home : bandaged from his surgery , @entity11 prepares to leave the hospital family affairs : @entity11 ' mother changing his bandages after brain surgery ' he understands enough about the world to know what he ¿ s missing , " @entity9 told the @entity139 about his brother ' the time i spend with him , looking through my camera , has forced me to ask questions about suffering and faith and why anyone is born with disability , ' @entity9 writes learning : ' as i spent more and more time with the photographs , i began to see @entity11 more clearly as an individual , with his own set of wants and desires , ' @entity9 says			2

@entity29 's @entity17 portrays the life of his twin brother @entity11 over the last 13 years
