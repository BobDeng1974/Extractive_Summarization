the growing number of mps who fear @entity2 is leading them to defeat have missed their chance to remove him if @entity5 pulls off an unlikely victory in tomorrow ’s by - election in the @entity9 stronghold of @entity10 the clamour for @entity2 to be replaced as party leader will be deafening			1
former ministers and senior backbenchers will take to the airwaves to demand the departure of @entity2 , who is trailing @entity17 badly in the polls			1
but they will be whistling in the wind and @entity2 knows it			1
unlike the @entity21 , who ruthlessly dispatch leaders , as @entity24 found to her cost , the @entity9 is sentimental about failing leaders			0
the party ’s rules state challengers must come forward before conference and be supported by 20 per cent of the @entity33			1
so the growing number of @entity35 who fear @entity2 is leading them to defeat missed their moment			1
conference was nearly two weeks ago			0
there is a bitter irony in their failure to wield the knife			0
they were hoping @entity2 would deliver another game - changing conference speech			1
last year , his promise to cap energy prices caught the @entity21 unaware and @entity9 surged in the polls			0
the policy , like so many of @entity2 ’s promises , soon unravelled			1
this time , he confounded expectations yet again , but for the wrong reasons			0
his @entity56 speech was a catastrophe			0
his inexplicable omission of any mention of the deficit and immigration will haunt him until polling day			0
the small team around @entity2 , which is weak and accident prone , was excluded from the crucial final drafting of the speech – arguably the most important of his leadership			2
bizarrely , @entity2 shut himself away for a week beforehand with @entity67 , an @entity68 academic , who is his closest friend			2
by turning his back on his few remaining loyal supporters at @entity71 , @entity2 cemented his growing political isolation			2
over the past week , @entity9 donors and virtually all the party ’s @entity75 mayoral hopefuls have joined the criticism of @entity2 by denouncing his flagship mansion tax proposal			1
@entity79 , the influential @entity9 chairman of the commons public accounts committee , who also disowned the policy , repeatedly refused to say she was confident @entity9 would win the next election when she spoke at a fringe event at the conference			0
as the noises off grow , there has been a conspicuous silence from @entity2 ’s so - called supporters , who clearly realise the game is up			2
@entity91 is gripping @entity2 ’s office			2
preparations for the @entity94 and @entity95 by - election , caused by the defection to @entity5 of the @entity99 mp @entity98 , are in chaos			0
labour leader @entity2 ( left ) is facing growing rumblings of discontent from within his own party , while @entity104 ( right ) is training the party 's next generation of rising stars a well - sourced report by @entity109 , editor of the grass - roots blog @entity111 , said : ‘ senior labour figures have sought to dampen expectations that @entity9 could win the seat			1
do n’t expect @entity9 to be throwing resources at the coming by - election			0
’ lord @entity117 , former deputy leader and @entity2 loyalist , added to the ill ease when he wrote in the @entity120 that @entity9 had given up on outright victory : ‘ @entity2 might as well have said , “ go back to your constituencies and prepare for coalition ”			1
’ the crisis deepened with reports yesterday suggesting @entity127 , the former home secretary , is being urged to stand as leader			1
and ominously for @entity2 , the arch - @entity129 lord @entity104 is devoting his still considerable energies to grooming the next generation of rising stars			1
his preferred choice is @entity134 , 35 , the party ’s business spokesman			0
having got it wrong last time @entity35 know they ca n’t afford another mistake			0
some still cling to the forlorn hope that @entity2 will do the right thing and resign			2
but @entity2 is ruthless , as his brother discovered , and he is staying put – to the huge relief of @entity17 .			0

challengers to @entity2 's party rule have missed their chance to remove him
reports suggest @entity127 is being urged to stand as leader
@entity104 is also working to train new generation of rising stars
