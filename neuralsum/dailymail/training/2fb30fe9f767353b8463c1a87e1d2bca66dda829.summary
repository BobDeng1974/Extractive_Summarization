@entity7 and @entity3 received floral bouquets and a standing ovation from the audience of about 1,000 people in @entity13 's @entity12 he said : ' i grew up with the words , " never again "			1
' it is kind of inconceivable that there are people who say the @entity1 did n't exist			0
@entity7 is a living contradiction of what those people are saying			2
' he said @entity7 was able to survive ' because he had music , because he had friends , because the power of music could fill in the empty spaces			2
' he added : ' to me @entity7 is a huge hero , and is a huge inspiration			2
embraced : @entity3 greets @entity7 in a rehearsal room before their performance warming up : cellist @entity3 and @entity7 had a brief rehearsal before the performance in aid of the @entity15 ' he is a witness to a window , and to a slice of history , that we never want to see again , and yet we keep seeing versions of that all over the world			1

@entity3 thanked @entity7 for helping the @entity15 , named for the town of @entity25 , site of an unusual @entity79 ghetto in what was then @entity82 - occupied @entity81			1
' it 's an extraordinary link to the past , ' said concert organizer @entity75			0
@entity103 did not survive the genocide			0
but his musical legacy has , due in part to a chance meeting of @entity75 , a scholar of @entity25 composers , and @entity7 , who never forgot the songs that were written and played in captivity			2
@entity75 said he found it hard to ask @entity7 to perform pieces laden with such difficult memories			2
