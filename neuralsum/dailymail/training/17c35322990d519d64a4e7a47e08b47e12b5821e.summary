by @entity0 published : 04:39 est , 19 june 2013 updated : 18:50 est , 19 june 2013 the families of @entity4 soldiers killed in battle have won a landmark legal victory that gives them the right to sue the @entity8			1
the @entity9 ruled that relatives of four servicemen who died in @entity12 could seek compensation for negligence and breach of human rights			1
the @entity4 's highest court said the government owed a duty of care to properly equip and train troops sent to war , but defence secretary @entity22 said he was ' concerned ' that it could make it ' more difficult for troops to carry out operations '			1
three of the men were killed when their controversial @entity29 were blown up by roadside bombs			2
the poorly protected vehicles – nicknamed ' mobile coffins ' because of their vulnerability to blasts – were finally replaced in 2008			2
private @entity32 , 21 , of @entity59 , @entity60 , died when his snatch struck an improvised explosive device in july 2005 ; private @entity63 , 23 , of @entity64 , @entity65 , was killed in february 2006 ; and lance corporal @entity37 , 22 , of @entity66 , @entity67 , died in august 2007			0
their families argued that the @entity8 was culpable because it failed to provide adequately protected vehicles and knew the @entity29 were vulnerable to blasts			1
eight years ago , private @entity32 died on a dusty battlefield in @entity12			0
the @entity74 soldier was killed when the @entity75 he was in struck a bomb near the town of @entity35 on july 16 , 2005			0
since then , his mother @entity78 has fought her own battle – with the @entity8			1
she argued that the government breached his human rights by negligently failing to provide adequately armoured vehicles			0
@entity8 chiefs insisted that they could not be held liable because the troops died on the battlefield and not on a @entity4 army base or in the @entity4			1
she took her fight to the @entity88 and the @entity89 without success but finally triumphed yesterday			0
mrs @entity78 , 51 , of @entity59 , @entity60 , said : ' it has been like headbutting a wall			0
the @entity8 has argued and covered up every step of the way			1
' she said she fought to prevent other families suffering a loss of a son in the way she did			0
' @entity32 is dead , ' she said			0
' nothing is going to bring him back			0
but this might save other boys ' lives in the future			0
' the ' snatch ' , originally used to grab rioters in @entity108 , weighs 3.5tons and has a 3.5 - litre v8 engine			0
costing £ 60,000 , it has become notorious for its lack of protection against roadside bombs and 37 @entity4 personnel have been killed in them			0
the @entity8 said the @entity117 did not apply because the soldiers died in @entity12 and not on a @entity120 base or in the @entity4			1
the court also upheld a ruling allowing the families of three other soldiers to sue the @entity8 for negligence over a ' friendly fire ' incident in which a challenger tank fired at another when an officer became ' disorientated '			1
corporal @entity39 , 35 , of @entity131 , @entity132 - on - @entity133 , was killed in the incident in march 2003			2
lance corporal @entity134 , of @entity135 , @entity136 , and trooper @entity137 , of @entity138 , @entity65 , were badly injured			0
their families argued that the @entity8 was negligent for failing to properly equip the tanks and give soldiers adequate training			1
@entity8 lawyers argued that the nature of the battlefield meant it was incompatible with the idea of a ' right to life '			2
the rulings leave the @entity8 facing a multi-million pound bill for damages			1
the cases could take two years to reach court and the @entity9 justices warned the families they would have to prove a case for compensation			2
trooper @entity158 ( left ) died when his @entity159 was fired on by comrades in another @entity4 tank and private @entity63 of the @entity162 was killed by a roadside bomb @entity164 , deputy president of the @entity9 , added : ' it is of paramount importance that the work the @entity168 do in the national interest should not be impeded by having to prepare for or conduct active operations against an enemy under the threat of litigation if things go wrong			1
' but private @entity32 's mother @entity175 , 51 , said of the judgment : ' it is brilliant			0
the @entity8 can no longer treat soldiers as sub-humans with no rights			1
' lance corporal @entity37 's father @entity182 , 57 , said : ' the @entity8 has now got a duty of care to supply our brave troops with the right equipment in a combat zone			1
in the past , the @entity8 could have given them a broomstick and that would have been okay			2
' corporal @entity39 's widow @entity192 , of @entity132 , @entity60 , said : ' what we have achieved has changed history			0
' mr @entity22 said : ' it ca n't be right that troops on operations have to put the @entity200 ahead of what is operationally vital to protect our national security			2

@entity9 rules relatives can sue for negligence and claim damages
they claim soldiers killed in friend - fire attacks and @entity212 were not properly protected under @entity8 's duty of care
defence secretary @entity22 warns against *military* decisions being open to the ' *uncertainty* of litigation '
