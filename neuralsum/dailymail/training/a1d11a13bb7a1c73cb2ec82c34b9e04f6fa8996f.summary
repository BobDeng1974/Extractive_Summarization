dapper in a navy suit , red and blue striped tie and a pair of polished dress shoes , the @entity0 was every inch the prince as he met well - wishers in @entity8 today			1
but there was one part of his ensemble that was n't quite so princely - the turquoise and black loom band that peeped out from beneath his cuff			1
he was given the bracelet while chatting to young well - wishers , and as he put it on , even revealed he already had a stash of 200 at home			2
@entity33 of @entity0 is also a fan , after being given a red and pink band by a little girl during the tour of @entity37 and @entity38 in april , as is the @entity39			1
since the @entity39 appeared in one , loom bands have become one of this summer 's biggest trends , with sales rocketing by 300 per cent over the past three months - thanks in part to the @entity46			1
but it was n't all loom bands , with @entity27 using his visit to the @entity50 in @entity8 to call for more protection from councils for memorial parks			1
on his first public engagement as president of the @entity57 ( @entity57 ) charity , the prince highlighted the charity 's @entity59 programme which is run in partnership with the @entity62			1
@entity27 , who placed a wreath at the garden ’s centrepiece memorial during his visit , said these green spaces should not be taken for granted , describing them as ' a vital part of our national heritage '			1
looking good : the loom band craze kicked off in april after the @entity73 was seen wearing one suits you ! prince @entity27 was n't the only person to sport a loom band with many in the crowd doing the same ahead of his visit to @entity8 , the prince had also penned an op - ed run in local publications around the country , in which he spoke of his admiration for the deeds of the soldiers whose sacrifice the parks honour			1
' @entity90 continues to inspire us – one hundred years on – to undertake acts of remembrance for men and women otherwise long forgotten , ' he wrote			0
' each moment of play or use that takes place on a memorial field is , in a way , an act of remembrance			0
' during his visit to the park , he also found time to speak to ex-paratroopers @entity107 and @entity109 who fought in @entity110 in the 1960s			2
afterwards , @entity27 helped a class from the city 's @entity113 to plant poppy seeds near the park 's play area			1
sombre : during his visit to the @entity50 in @entity8 , prince @entity27 laid a wreath in remembrance helping out : after laying the wreath , the prince - and some local children - planted poppy seeds in the park and action ! prince @entity27 rounded off his visit to the park with a game of tennis played with local children but it was the royal embrace of loom bands that left well - wishers agog - a trend also picked up by a-listers such as @entity136 and @entity137			1
also getting involved with the trend is the @entity140 family which is selling the bands on their @entity144 website			2
the bands have also proved lucrative for their inventor , @entity148 father - of - two @entity147 , who came up with the idea last year			2
since then , his company , @entity150 , has sold more than four million kits - including a plastic loom , crochet hook and bands – worldwide			1
' the loom bands are an absolute phenomenon , ' commented @entity157 , senior buyer for kids at @entity159			1
' we began stocking the kits since they originally launched last year and since the @entity73 was seen wearing one , they have been flying off our shelves			1
' the options for what you can create are endless and these kits really can keep children entertained for hours , perfect for the summer holidays			2
’ with yet another royal happy to show off his love for the plastic bracelets , it seems the loom band craze could well be here to stay			1
' @entity90 continues to inspire us – one hundred years on – to undertake acts of remembrance for men and women otherwise long forgotten			0
one of the most obvious manifestations of remembrance which continue to touch us today is the countless war memorials up and down the country			0
most are typical : stone crosses or statues , surrounded by the names of the young men who never returned home			0
but some were more ambitious , and none more so than the plots of land which were set aside by communities as spaces of remembrance			0
these spaces were designed to encourage both stillness and movement , inward reflection and outward play			0
in short , places where freedom may be expressed with such ease			0
this @entity50 in @entity8 has to be one of the most extraordinary examples of this			2
the stunning war memorial , and the many other memorials around the park , are dotted between places where children play football and throw frisbees , families picnic together , or walk the dog			0
it is a beautiful place – @entity220 and the people it serves have every right to be immensely proud of it			0
the @entity59 project , which i am privileged to launch today , aims to save in perpetuity scores of memorial spaces around the country			0
most will not be as large as this , but every one is valued by its community			0
each moment of play or leisure that takes place on a @entity237 is , in a way , an act of remembrance			0
i am delighted that @entity57 have identified these @entity59 as a vital part of our national heritage and well - being , which we can not take for granted			0
working with @entity62 , @entity57 will encourage and cajole local authorities all across the country to follow @entity8 ’s lead to safeguard @entity248 in their area			2
i have no doubt that they will succeed , but only if they have help			0
i encourage local authorities to support this cause and to safeguard these living spaces of remembrance for generations to come			0
