by @entity0 published : 08:30 est , 20 december 2012 updated : 02:51 est , 21 december 2012 a @entity2 grandmother has avoided the death penalty – but faces 15 years in a @entity5 jail for drug - running			1
@entity7 , 56 , has been spared execution because of her age and for her co-operation with authorities on the holiday isle			1
they also rewarded her good behaviour			0
she is expected to be sentenced by three judges on january 3			0
@entity7 is one of ‘ the @entity2 gang of four ’ who were linked by customs officials and police after the grandmother tried to smuggle £ 1.6million of cocaine into the country from @entity23 last may			1
also facing an uncertain future is former antiques restorer @entity7 , 43 , from @entity42 , whose court hearing is expected to take place in the weeks following @entity7 ’s case in january			1
but there was relief for @entity7 ’s partner , @entity7 , the 39 - year - old mother of their six - year - old daughter , when she received a one - year jail sentence in the @entity52 yesterday			1
she could be on her way back to the @entity2 by april , to be reunited with her daughter , because she has already been in jail for eight months awaiting trial			1
nervous wait : prosecutors on the holiday island of @entity5 said they would ask for 15 years jail for the 56 - year - old because of her co-operation in a major drug smuggling case , but it is up to three judges caught : despite mrs @entity7 allegedly ' coming clean ' and telling police who her contacts were , officers were unable to find any physical evidence to connect the grandmother with the three suspects hiding : @entity7 , 56 , from @entity74 , was stopped at @entity75 with 4.8kg of cocaine worth £ 1.6 million before being paraded in front of the press , left , last may			1
in court , she covered her face with a cloth lawyer @entity82 said he would press for @entity7 to be released on parole next month			2
on wednesday , 39 - year - old @entity84 @entity7 , a long - time @entity5 resident , was also spared a heavy penalty when judges sentenced him to four years for possession of a small amount of hashish			1
police originally said the four @entity2 faced death because of the amount of cocaine involved – but as the investigation continued , their case began to crumble			1
despite @entity7 allegedly ‘ coming clean ’ and telling police who her contacts were , officers were unable to find any physical evidence to connect the grandmother with the three suspects			2
jailed : during miss @entity7 's trial which ended yesterday , charges of possession of cocaine were dropped and instead she was found guilty of failing to inform the authorities of the presence of an illegal drug spared : 39 - year - old @entity109 , a long - time @entity5 resident , was spared a heavy sentence when the judges convicted him for possession of a small amount of hashish @entity114 : @entity7 , left , was jailed for a year after her charges were lessened while @entity7 , right , was imprisoned for four years for his role in the plot @entity7 and @entity7 insisted that they believed a gift - wrapped package of drugs @entity7 took to their house – watched by police who insisted she go through with her delivery instructions – was a birthday present for their daughter			1
although police did find drugs at the villa , it was a relatively small amount – 25g of cocaine hidden in a cigarette packet			2
it is understood from sources close to the police that all alleged conversations that took place between @entity7 and @entity7 – including one when @entity7 gave the grandmother instructions on where and when to deliver the contraband – were carried out through mobile phones			2
paraded : three @entity2 , @entity7 , @entity7 and @entity7 , and an @entity144 national were seen dressed in ill - fitting orange outfits and flip - flops after their arrests in may arrests : @entity7 was detained at @entity75 on the paradise island of @entity5 , @entity150 but investigators failed to retrieve any sim card during the raid on @entity7 ’s villa			1
as for the cocaine found in the cigarette packet , @entity7 admitted during an earlier hearing that it was his			2
charges of possession of cocaine against @entity7 were dropped			2
instead she was found guilty of failing to inform the authorities of the presence of an illegal drug – a much lesser offence			0
for @entity7 and @entity7 , their relatively light jail sentences will come as a relief after @entity7 told police that she had met both of them in @entity172 before she took the flight to @entity5			2
she said @entity7 placed the drugs in the lining of her suitcase and that @entity7 was the owner of the drugs , a claim both denied			1
@entity7 claims that her son in the @entity2 had been threatened with reprisals if she did not agree to carry the drugs into @entity5			1
@entity150 's drug scene is seen as something of a contradiction - as there is relatively high levels of illegal drug use and some of the strictest laws against them			0
the @entity150 authorities are ready to make an example of foreigners who use illegal drugs in their jurisdiction , with @entity5 's @entity196 housing plenty of non-indonesians			0
divided into three groups , category 1 drugs are recognised as ' therapeutically useless with a high potential for causing addiction '			0
they include cocaine and heroin			0
sentences are the most strict - with life imprisonment for possession , and the death penalty for convicted drug traffickers			0
group 2 drugs , such as morphine and methadone , are seen as ' useful for therapeutic purposes , but dangerous due to their high addictive potential '			0
possession is punishable by 3 to 10 years ' imprisonment , and fines of around £ 40,000 to £ 400,000			0
trafficking is punishable by 4 to 12 years ' imprisonment and £ 60,000 to £ 600,000 fines			0
@entity222 drugs , such as codeine , are seen as ' therapeutically useful and moderately addictive '			0
possession is punishable by 2 to 7 years ' imprisonment , and a fine of £ 30,000 to £ 280,000			0
while trafficking is punishable by 3 to 10 years and fine of £ 40,000 to £ 400,000 .			0
