' we are under no illusions it 's going to be competitive and we have to put our best foot forward			0
' at this stage we have n't had to tender documents , we wo n't get those for another 12 months or more			0
' for the @entity48 @entity5 the guarantee tournament fee which has to be paid to @entity5 is £ 96million			2
' one assumes we are going to have to pay at least that , probably more			0
' governing body @entity49 will not officially launch the bidding process for @entity5 2023 host status until next year , and have not even finalised a timeline for applications			1
@entity8 are the first nation to launch a bid for the 2023 tournament , but must now await further instruction from @entity49 on when to make any official tender			2

political administrations in @entity4 's north and south have given the bid the green light after a 10 - month preliminary assessment exercise			0
@entity27 premier @entity107 @entity21 , @entity109 's first minister @entity16 and deputy first minister @entity17 joined @entity6 boss @entity39 to announce the bid in @entity111 on friday			1
@entity112 will host next year 's @entity5 before the tournament descends on @entity48 in 2019 , with @entity49 making good on long - held promises to grow the game beyond traditional heartlands			1

@entity120 held the inaugural 1987 tournament , repeating hosting duties in 2011 , while @entity112 will become the second nation to claim the honour twice , with 2015 following 1991			0

the rugby - mad nation received a huge infrastructure boost for the @entity138 football @entity5 staged in 2010 , so would argue much of the preparation work is already in place			0
