precious : @entity1 with husband @entity2 and their daughter @entity0 , now 16 months old after going through the menopause aged 20 , @entity1 was told she could never have children naturally			1
so when she went to the doctor with stomach pains 15 years later , she was astonished to learn that she was pregnant – and the baby was due within days			2
the 36 - year - old was afraid she had cancer when she felt pain and found a lump in her stomach			1
instead , medics told her she was eight months pregnant , and just 12 days later she gave birth to daughter @entity0 , who weighed 6lb 4oz			1
mrs @entity1 said : ‘ @entity0 is truly a miracle			1
we simply could n’t believe it when doctors said i was not only pregnant – but so close to delivery			2
’ the fitness instructor became alarmed when she felt unusually tired after one 40 - mile bike ride			1
she said : ‘ around the same time i noticed pains in my tummy , and over the past few weeks , i had thought i could feel a lump			2
terrified , i booked an appointment with my gp			0
’ her doctor believed the lump was ‘ probably a large cyst ’ and quickly sent mrs @entity1 to hospital for tests			1
she was sure pregnancy was not a possibility because at the age of 30 , after marrying her husband @entity2 , she had gone back to the doctor ’s to double check that she would never conceive naturally			0
she recalled : ‘ @entity2 and i were worried it was something serious			0
so we were overcome with emotion when the woman doing an ultrasound said i was eight months pregnant			2
relief that it was n’t cancer and sheer joy that we were having a baby			1
‘ we were also in shock – when a midwife arrived to discuss birthing arrangements i thought i was dreaming			0
‘ in hindsight i ’d had other signs , but put morning sickness down to a virus and tiredness down to being busy			0
’ mrs @entity1 was told she would never have children naturally after going through menopause in her twenties			1
most women experience the menopause – a natural change in the body ’s sex hormones – between 45 and 55			1
she could hardly believe she was a mum concern : the fitness instructor became alarmed when she felt unusually tired after a bike ride			1
right , @entity0 surprise : medics told her she was eight months pregnant , and just 12 days later she gave birth to @entity73 in rare cases , some women experience menopause before they reach 40 , often for no known cause			1
this premature ovarian failure affects about one in 100 women before 40 , and five in 100 by 45			2
mrs @entity1 said : ‘ i only had scanty periods in my teens and they stopped completely when i was 20			1
but it was still terrible to be told so young that i ’d never have a family			0
the average age at which women go through the menopause in @entity88 is 51			2
menopause occurs when a woman ’s ovaries run out of eggs , meaning she can no longer have children			2
one in 20 women goes through an early menopause , before the age of 45 , because her ovaries stop working properly , a @entity88 study found last year			1
the process can be gradual , with a woman producing eggs and having periods intermittently			0
during this perimenopause stage , which can last years , a woman may still conceive , although experts usually describe the chance as negligible			0
there may be no medical reason for early menopause , or it may be caused by hysterectomy , radiotherapy or chemotherapy			2
the @entity113 is a support group for women going through early menopause			1
‘ we ’d already given up all thoughts of having a baby , we ’d never used contraception and in fact since i ’ve been with @entity2 i ’ve never had a period			0
but it was still terribly sad when tests confirmed i ’d definitely gone through the menopause and that i ’d never be a mum or make @entity2 a dad			0
he gave me a hug and said perhaps being parents was n’t for us			0
’ instead , @entity2 , 41 , wrote a ‘ bucket list ’ of things they could look forward to as a childless couple			0
over a decade the pair , from @entity130 , travelled the world and pursued hobbies such as long - distance bike riding and hill walking			0
but they were delighted to learn the doctors had been wrong , and could n’t wait to tell their stunned friends and family the news			0
mrs @entity1 said : ‘ @entity2 and i rushed round in a haze of excitement buying baby clothes			1
one friend donated a pushchair , another gave me a book about pregnancy – i skipped to the last month			0
‘ it was strange telling people our baby was due in the next four weeks			0
’ after 12 days , in july 2013 , she woke with contractions – and five - and - a - half hours later @entity0 was born			1
mrs @entity1 said : ‘ she was perfect , beautiful			2
after my 12 - day pregnancy i could hardly take it in – i was a mum			2
’ delighted : @entity2 , 41 , had written a ‘ bucket list ’ of things they could look forward to as a childless couple ' perfect ' : @entity0 , above on her birthday , is now 16 months old and the @entity160 still ca n’t believe she ’s here mystery : mrs @entity1 said that doctors have no idea why she conceived so many years after the menopause @entity0 is now 16 months old and the @entity160 still ca n’t believe she ’s here			1
mrs @entity1 explained : ‘ doctors have no idea why so many years after going through the menopause i suddenly conceived			1
since her birth i still have n’t had a period , so while we ’d love another baby , it might be she is our only child			0
‘ we are just enjoying our precious daughter – she is the miracle baby we never thought we ’d have			0
we look at her and feel incredibly lucky			0
