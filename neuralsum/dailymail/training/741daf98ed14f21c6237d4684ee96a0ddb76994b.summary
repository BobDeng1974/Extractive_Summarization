a @entity1 plastic surgeon could be struck off after he was found guilty of teaching nurses how to administer @entity4 to patients illegally			1
dr @entity6 charged the nurses £ 400 a day for the training courses at his central @entity10 clinic , during which he told them they should give @entity4 to patients without a prescription			1
after being exposed by an undercover investigation , the 51 - year - old surgeon denied wrongdoing , but he has now been found guilty of encouraging the nurses to break the law			1
he charged £ 30 for each ' consultation ' - and offered a day - long training course at his practice , @entity35 , to prepare nurses who want to administer @entity4 , which makes the skin smoother and is commonly used as an anti-wrinkle treatment			1
in 2012 , a @entity40 journalist went undercover posing as a trainee nurse to film the doctor secretly during one of his ' introduction to @entity4 ' courses			0
@entity6 , who lives in a £ 4million @entity47 townhouse , apparently told nurses to use @entity4 on one patient even though it was prescribed for someone else , and encouraged them to ignore a patient 's medical history			1
he was filmed telling the nurses : ' strictly speaking a vial with a patient name on should only be used on that patient			2
we use it on a number of people			0
is it ever an issue ? no. ' it is not legal , but it 's what everybody does ... doctors , professors , me			0
just order a vial in your name - it 's not policed at all			0
' prescription : the doctor spoke to nurses on the phone and authorised them to administer @entity4 to patients in the recording , he also suggested that if nurses could not contact him before administering @entity4 they should go ahead with the procedure nonetheless and he would authorise it afterwards			2
at a fitness to practice hearing in @entity84 , a disciplinary panel rejected claims that @entity6 had been a victim of ' entrapment ' by the @entity40 investigation			0
he was also found guilty of making dishonest and misleading statements to an preliminary hearing of the @entity90 , but cleared of other misconduct charges including a claim that he encouraged nurses to top up @entity4 with saline solution			1
at a previous hearing , @entity6 said : ' i can understand that on a busy ward with lots of different vials and lots of different patients , to use vials between patients would be dangerous			0
' however , in the context of @entity4 where you have a single practitioner administering a single medication to one patient at a time , i would contend that that is not dangerous , but i have not been accused of doing it			2
' clinic : @entity6 practiced from this address in @entity1 , where the courses were held but finding him guilty , the panel said : ' dr @entity6 , during the @entity4 course , encouraged attendees to order @entity4 in the name of patients for whom it was not intended to be used			1
dr @entity6 , on several occasions , encouraged this practice			0
' he now faces further hearings to decide whether his fitness to practise medicine is impaired			0
@entity128 was one of the @entity130 's largest providers of @entity4 , offering a range of treatments starting from £ 200			2
@entity6 built up a network of hundreds of nurses who would call his mobile whenever they wanted authorisation to inject a patient with @entity4			1
in the wake of the investigation into his practice , the @entity90 has banned doctors from remotely prescribing cosmetic injections such as @entity4 , meaning they must hold a face - to - face consultation with the patient .			0

@entity6 , 51 , ran the @entity35 clinic in central @entity10
he authorised nurses to inject @entity4 by speaking to them on the phone
at a training day he told nurses they could use @entity4 prescribed for one patient on multiple different people
@entity6 , who lives in a £ 4m @entity47 townhouse , has been found guilty of misconduct and could now be struck off
