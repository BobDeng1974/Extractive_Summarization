@entity0 believes @entity1 have a stronger squad this season as the challenge of juggling league and cup football beckons			1
@entity8 's side reached the semi-finals of the @entity10 last season and start their tilt at the trophy with a home game against @entity15 on tuesday evening			1
weigh them up : @entity0 is confident @entity1 can balance the @entity17 and cup competitions the @entity1 were in the midst of a mid-season injury crisis as they lost 9 - 0 on aggregate to the eventual winners @entity22 in january - with @entity17 survival the main concern			1
with a number of first - team players missing at the time , @entity8 was forced to field an inexperienced side in both legs - but @entity0 , who scored his first goal of the season in saturday 's 3 - 1 win at @entity33 , reckons the summer recruit drive at @entity35 will help significantly on that front			1
' i think all the new signings have settled in well and those who have played have made good starts , ' said the @entity42 winger			0
' we have a bit of a stronger squad this season which i think helps the manager			1
last season the team had to literally pick itself at times because of injuries			0
' we have a lot more options now and can change it around a bit if needed			0
' of the seven new acquisitions , @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 have made an instant impact - with the latter opening the scoring at @entity60 with a spectacular volley			0
balance : @entity1 lost in the semi-final of the @entity10 to @entity22 last season strikers @entity64 and @entity65 are still working on their fitness , while @entity67 is injured and young midfielder @entity68 has played just eight minutes			1
with a deeper squad at his disposal , @entity8 is likely to give @entity68 - as well as @entity71 and @entity65 - a chance to work their way into his thinking against the @entity76			2
@entity0 will also want to be involved against the @entity78 side as he looks to add to his goal on saturday , which equalled the solitary strike he managed throughout the whole of last season			1
' obviously i am eager as is the manager for me to get more goals this season , ' he added			0
' to get off the mark second game in , is nice			0
i want to shoot more , get in the positions i need to be in			0
with the goal , i had it in my head what i wanted to do and hit it where i wanted to and it worked			0
' it will be the first meeting of the two sides since @entity1 agreed an out - of - court settlement for a fee reported to be in excess of £ 20million to be paid as compensation to the @entity76			2
victory : @entity1 beat @entity33 3 - 1 on saturday , after an opening day defeat to @entity105 the argument stemmed following @entity15 's relegation from the @entity17 in 2007 - with @entity1 surviving thanks largely to the goals of @entity110			1
it was later discovered that @entity110 , as well as fellow @entity113 international @entity112 , were partially owned by @entity114 , a company run by @entity115			0
the @entity17 fined @entity1 £ 5.5million and , after @entity15 unsuccessfully appealed to be reinstated to the league with @entity1 relegated instead , a two - year legal wrangle ended with the settlement			2
with plenty of ill - feeling between the two sets of fans , @entity8 insisted on saturday he would do his utmost to appease @entity1 's supporters by winning the fixture			1
' i think the reaction is to get a team out there that wins , ' he said			0
' i 'm not so sure how guilty @entity15 were on it but that 's nothing do with me			2
it 's about making sure the fans are happy when i go on tuesday because they feel aggrieved at what @entity15 did and if i can do that for them , then great			2
