@entity0 are sweating on the availability of @entity2 and @entity3 for their top of the table clash with @entity6 on saturday – but whether the two @entity7 can play may come down to the luck of the draw			1
@entity10 face @entity11 on wednesday night knowing that a win will guarantee them a place in the quarter - finals of the @entity16 , and keep the @entity0 stars in @entity18 for at least another week			1
but , if they lose , @entity2 and @entity3 will head home on thursday , and could be ready to face @entity6 this weekend			2
the @entity7 could have their fate decided off the pitch , by the drawing of lots			0
despite a star - studded line - up of players based at top @entity47 clubs , the @entity43 have drawn both of their first two games 1 - 1			1
and , remarkably , both the other games in the group , which also features @entity11 , @entity23 and @entity18 , have also ended with the same scoreline			1
that means that , going into the final round of fixtures , all four teams are level on points , head - to - head , goal difference and goals scored			0
should that remain the same after wednesday night ’s games , lots would have to be drawn to determine which two sides go through to the quarter - finals , and which two are eliminated			2
that means if both games end in the same score draw then all four teams will need to be picked out of a hat to determine their position in the group			0
@entity3 's debut date for @entity0 could be determined by drawing lots if the group remain dead level @entity2 could be back in time for @entity0 's clash with @entity6 if @entity10 are eliminated but , even if one game ends with a positive result , were the other to be a draw there would still need to be lot drawing to decide who goes through , and who goes out , of the teams that finished level			1
and , just to complicate matters further , two wins by the same score would see a toss - up to see who finishes first and second in the group			0
if the sides do need to be separated by picking out of a hat , @entity92 have confirmed that the draw will take place immediately after the games in @entity97 on wednesday night			0
but amid all the permutations , @entity98 must be quietly hoping that @entity11 can show more cutting edge than in their first two games , freeing his stars to return to @entity103 on thursday morning without relying on luck			2
city manager @entity98 ( right ) will be hoping the @entity7 return for the top of the table clash			0

@entity10 face @entity11 in final @entity32 game at @entity16
all four teams , *including* @entity23 and @entity18 , have drawn their opening two games by the same 1 - 1 scoreline
*depending* on final game results , the *progress* of teams could be decided by drawing lots if they can not be separated
@entity0 will be hoping @entity2 and @entity3 can return for their @entity122 *showdown* with @entity6 on saturday
