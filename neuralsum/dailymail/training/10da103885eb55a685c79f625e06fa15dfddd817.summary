experts said the rise could be down to @entity3 's proposed crackdown on migrant benefits			1
as @entity6 citizens , they would be immune thousands of @entity8 immigrants are deciding to take @entity6 citizenship , with approved applications up 1,200 per cent in only five years			1
for the first time , @entity8 are in the top ten nationalities of foreign - born people who are being granted @entity6 passports			1
in 2013 , a record 6,066 applications were rubber - stamped by the @entity17 – up from just 458 in 2009			2
the phenomenon is unusual because citizens of fellow @entity21 countries do not usually bother to adopt @entity6 nationality , since they already have full rights to live and work here			1
the change was welcomed by migration campaigners , with @entity27 chairman @entity26 of @entity28 saying : ‘ this is an encouraging sign of the developing integration of the @entity8 community			2
’ experts say one explanation for @entity8 – who have arrived in unprecedented numbers over the past decade – taking @entity6 citizenship is that they have become unnerved by the prospect of @entity6 cracking down on benefits or even leaving the @entity21 altogether			1
by becoming @entity6 citizens , they are insulated from any future changes planned by @entity3			0
the prime minister has promised an in / out referendum on @entity6 ’s @entity21 membership in 2017			0
he also intends to make @entity21 migrants wait four years to get lucrative in - work benefits , such as tax credits			0
by taking @entity6 nationality , the @entity8 will also be entitled to vote in may ’s general election			1
there are also many examples of @entity8 marrying @entity6 citizens and having children , which might make it more likely they will take @entity6 nationality			1
normally , a migrant has to live in @entity6 for five years before they can apply for citizenship			1
@entity8 first began arriving in significant numbers in 2004 , when the @entity21 ’s borders were expanded eastwards			0
in 2009 , when the first of the new arrivals would have been entitled to apply for citizenship , 458 cases were approved			1
in 2013 the @entity17 rubber stamped 6,066 citizenship requests from @entity8 , up from 458 in 2009 , putting them ninth in national rankings - with @entity65 coming in first this rose to 1,419 in 2010 , 1,863 in 2011 , 3,043 in 2012 and then 6,066 in 2013 – doubling in a single year			1
at that rate , as many as 12,000 @entity8 a year may now be receiving citizenship			2
dr @entity73 , senior lecturer at the @entity74 – who is @entity8 – said : ‘ people who have started to settle , started to look at their kids or having families , looked at staying in @entity6 long - term , this is a shift relating to the @entity6 political discourse surrounding the presence of @entity6 in @entity72			1
‘ they want to secure their political and social rights			0
the more the @entity82 bang on about the referendum , the potential exit from the @entity21 , the more it makes @entity8 feel insecure			0
' the more restrictive the language around migration , the more it predisposes migrants to seek naturalisation			0
‘ i would not be surprised to see a bigger increase once the date of the referendum is set or when @entity3 makes up his mind which way to jump , yes or no. ’ in 2013 , @entity8 ranked ninth on the list of countries whose citizens had been granted @entity6 nationality			1
@entity100 was @entity65 with 36,351 approvals , followed by @entity102 ( 21,655 ) , @entity103 ( 10,374 ) , @entity104 ( 9,275 ) and @entity105 ( 8,902 )			0
last night a source at the @entity107 in @entity108 said the number of @entity8 applying for @entity6 passports was still fewer than 1 per cent of the 800,000 @entity8 citizens in the @entity6			1
the source added : ‘ some @entity8 have been in the @entity6 since 2004 so have already got settled , bought houses or apartments here and are simply planning their future in @entity6 , so applying for a @entity6 passport is not such a bad idea			2
’ immigrants to @entity6 are natural conservatives who are finding the party more and more attractive , @entity118 has claimed			2
the @entity122 chairman said the @entity122 message of working hard and getting on appeals to voters who have come to settle in @entity6 and often ‘ work every hour ’ to provide for their family			2
mr @entity118 was responding to @entity129 research , reported in yesterday ’s @entity130 , showing two @entity108 seats – @entity132 and @entity133 – which will be contested at the general election contain a majority of voters born overseas			0
many other constituencies contain large minorities			0
a record four million migrants born abroad will be entitled to vote in may , half a million more than at the last election			0
cabinet office minister mr @entity118 said he did not believe the trend posed a threat to his party ’s chances in the election			0
mr @entity118 , whose father ’s @entity146 family emigrated from @entity8 in the late 19th century , said : ‘ i see the conservative party becoming more and more attractive to people from all different backgrounds , particularly because so many of the immigrant communities are people who work hard and get on in life ... so i think they are naturally @entity122			2
’ the @entity129 research has led to speculation that the biggest losers could be the @entity82 , who have been accused of pursuing anti-immigrant rhetoric in response to the @entity160 threat			0
mr @entity118 conceded that the election would be ‘ incredibly close ’ , but insisted that @entity3 would not go into a coalition with @entity160 if he fails to win a majority in may .			0

total of 6,066 @entity8 applied for @entity6 citizenship in 2012 , up from 458 in 2009
rise is usual as most immigrants with work rights do *n't* apply to be citizen
cuts to migrant benefits could cause boom as people insulate themselves
