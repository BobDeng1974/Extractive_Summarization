@entity0 visits four tanning salons a day and also uses fake tan and bronzer to maintain her deep golden skin colour a young woman has become so obsessed with achieving the perfect tan that she has allowed it to take over both her life and finances			1
unable to rely on the @entity11 weather for her desired bronzed look @entity0 spends £ 1,000 a month on her habit , applying layers of fake tan as soon as she wakes up in the morning and visiting up to four tanning salons a day			1
the 19 - year - old , from @entity17 , @entity18 , is forced to visit so many beauty parlours as the maximum time that each salon allows for tanning is 15 minutes			1
nowhere near enough time for @entity0 to achieve her extreme bronze shade			1
despite having already spent 40 minutes under various sunbeds , @entity0 , who works in a clothing store , then returns home to top up her tan with bronzer			1
@entity0 first started building up her tan when she was just 14 , despite the fact the legal age for using the sunbeds is 18			1
she would go along to salons with older sister @entity33 , and claims to have never been asked for @entity34			2
although her parents caught her sneaking out of the house to visit the booths she continued to go , and by the age of 16 was hooked on looking as brown as she could			2
@entity0 says that she is not happy unless she performs her tanning ritual each day			1
' i try and go to about three or four places a day for 40 minutes so i can maximise my tanning chances			1
' @entity0 says that she has become such a regular at some salons that they have even started to provide her with a discount			1
' everyone in the shops know me , they charge around £ 1 a minute but i get discounted mate 's rates			2
' there is a hairdressers not too far from my house that start asking me where i am when i do n't go in			2
' the obsessive bronzer squeezes her tanning in wherever she can , beginning her beauty regime from the moment she gets up			1
' @entity0 often squeezes bronzing sessions into her lunch breaks at her part - time job @entity0 says that she applies a layer of fake tan as soon as she wakes up in the morning the shop assistant is often teased for her appearance with people calling names such as ' @entity76 ' the image - conscious teen is so hooked on sunbeds she even gets anxious and starts to feel down if she misses just one session			1
' if i see somebody in the street who 's darker than me i get jealous and envy them and wish i looked like that			1
' @entity0 says that she feels more confident the browner she is			2
@entity0 is noticeably darker than her friends who appear not to favour the fake tan look @entity0 attempted to stop tanning briefly but says that her self - esteem completely dropped ' it makes me feel happier when i 'm darker , i feel better in myself			1
it is how i like to look			0
' people compliment me all the time when i have a tan , they tell me i have a nice glow			2
if i do n't go on sunbeds i start to feel down and anxious			2
' @entity0 tried to give up the habit two years ago , but after just a week began to become depressed at her pale skin			1
' i tried to give up completely but it just could n't			2
i could see other people with their tans and i just thought being pale is not me			0
being tanned is just part of me			0
' @entity0 , who lives at home with her parents took on her part - time job at the clothes shop to fund the habit			1
@entity0 has learnt to ignore negative comments that she receives and says that as long as she is being teased it means someone else is left alone she currently earns £ 1,500 a month with a £ 1,000 going towards her tanning addiction			1
' i do spend around £ 1,000 a month on it all , i still live at home and i give my mum about £ 200 a month in rent			2
' it does n't leave much to live on , i do n't have much money to go out and buy new clothes , but it 's worth it to have a tan			1
' the 19 - year - old 's devotion to her skin tone has not gone unnoticed with @entity0 often being teased for looking like a real - life @entity76			1
however @entity0 is not bothered by the negatives that come with her constant tanning , whether that is the name calling or dry skin , she is happy with her appearance			1
' it does n't bother me when people say things to me , i let it go over my head			0
people call me ' @entity76 ' and shout out , ' you 've been tangoed ! ' but i love the way i look			0
' also , it they are taking about me then they are leaving someone else alone , which is always a positive			0
' my skin gets really dry , especially on my chest and neck , unless i moisturise all the time			0
it can ache if i do n't do something about it			0
i always have moisturiser with me			0
i use it as much as i can , there is a pot in every bag			0
' @entity0 's extreme tan appears even more dramatic when she stands next to her best friend @entity155 , a self - confessed goth who prides herself on being pale			1
@entity155 , 19 , even spreads on a special white cream to ensure she is the complete opposite of her pal			0
' @entity155 is quite gothic really , we are the absolute opposite ends of the scale			0
' i think it 's a bit of a shock to people when we go out because we are so different			0
' she 's used to it now , when i 'm sat there adding fake tan she has this special cream from the internet to make sure she is really pale			1
' i 've tried so many times to get her to put fake tan on but she wo n't have it ! ' @entity0 's use of sunbeds is dubbed as excessive and not recomended			1
@entity0 says that she is aware of the cancer risks of tanning but had not yet been affected			1
' obviously if anything like that happens to me i would n't keep doing that because my health is at risk , but until then i 'll keep going			0
' but leading cancer charities would like to urge young women and men to avoid using sunbeds to avoid the risk altogether			0
@entity0 's best friend @entity155 is a self - confessed goth who whitens her skin to look the opposite of her pal @entity190 , senior health information officer at @entity191 , said : ' we urge people not to use sunbeds for cosmetic reasons			1
' @entity190 added that rather from enhancing your appearance overuse of sunbeds can have a negative effect on your aesthetic			0
' far from improving your looks , the radiation given off by sunbeds leads to premature ageing - making skin look wrinkled , leathery and old , and it also damages the dna in skin cells			1
' over time this dna damage can build up and may lead to malignant melanoma - the most serious form of skin cancer			2
' @entity190 was also quick to point out that @entity0 's habit for fake tan will have no effect on her health whatsoever and she would encourage people to use that over the harmful alternative			1
the single 19 - year - old says that by using sunbeds so often she has been left with dry skin that can be painful ' we 'd like to see more people celebrating their natural skin tone but , if you really want a tanned look , it 's safer to fake it			1
' @entity226 , @entity227 at @entity228 also wished to express the dangers that come with achieving the perfect tan			0
' there is significant evidence that regular exposure to sunlight , sunbeds and sunlamps increases the risk of developing skin cancer			2
' this risk is increased further if someone uses sunbeds and sunlamps to excess			0
' @entity226 says that she wants to see salons who offer sunbeds to take a stricter approach when it comes to who can use the machines			2
' the use of sunbeds is prohibited for those aged under 18 by the @entity250 ( regulation ) @entity251			0
it also states that businesses providing sunbeds must provide information about the health risks associated with their use			0
' skin cancer can be as dangerous as any other types of cancer and if you have any concerns about changes to your skin , you should seek medical help			0
' teenagers who use sunbeds are nearly twice as likely to be diagnosed with the most dangerous form of skin cancer as those who have never been to a tanning salon , a study has found			1
research has shown that the earlier sunbed use begins , the greater the risk of developing a deadly melanoma before the age of 40			0
it shows that those who start before they turn 20 are 88 per cent more likely to be diagnosed with a deadly melanoma than people who have never used a sunbed			0
studies suggests that people up to the age of 25 may be more sensitive to the dangers of uv radiation , which is emitted from sunbeds at more intense levels than found in natural ­ daylight			2
of sunbed users diagnosed with skin cancer between the ages of 18 and 29 , some 76 per cent were likely to have developed the condition as a direct result of using uv booths			0
but for those diagnosed around ten years later , up to the age of 39 , only 13 per cent of cases could be attributed to sunbeds			2
a good way to tell the difference between a normal mole and a melanoma is to use the @entity309 checklist : a stands for asymmetrical : melanomas have two very different halves and are an irregular shape			0
@entity314 stands for border : unlike a normal mole , melanomas have a notched or ragged border			0
@entity319 stands for colours : melanomas will be a mix of two or more colours			0
@entity324 stands for diameter : unlike most moles , melanomas are larger than 6mm ( 1/4 inch ) in diameter			0
@entity329 stands for enlargement or evolution : a mole that changes characteristics and size over time is more likely to be a melanoma			0
