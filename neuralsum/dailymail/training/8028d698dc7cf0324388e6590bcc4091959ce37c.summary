it was the novel which confirmed @entity1 could address gritty adult issues as well as she could weave magic for children in the @entity6 books			1
but it seems the @entity7 was a little too bleak for the @entity8			1
the broadcaster has decided that @entity1 's first attempt at adult literature since the success of the @entity6 series was too ' grim ' for the small screen - so producers have rewritten the ending for sunday night audiences			1
pictured is sir @entity30 and @entity31 , who star in the upcoming mini-series a television adaptation of @entity7 is due to begin screening on sunday night			1
the three - part drama , starring sir @entity30 , @entity36 and @entity37 , paints a bleak picture of life in modern @entity24 and features storylines involving rape , drug abuse and racism			1
set in the fictitious @entity45 town of @entity46 , it features a community of rich and poor at war over the future of a community centre called @entity51 , home to social services including a drug rehabilitation centre and a food bank			1
@entity57 's wealthier residents , who are fed up with the centre being a haven for ' junkies and plebs ' from a nearby council estate called @entity63 , want to close it for good and turn it into a luxury hotel and spa			2
from left , @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity37 are pictured in the upcoming adaptation of the @entity7 the raft of changes made to the storyline of @entity7 have not been limited to its ending			1
pictured is actor @entity77 and actress @entity78 in a scene from the @entity8 adaptation they are bitterly opposed by the liberal faction on @entity46 parish council who believe it is essential for social cohesion			0
but the story paints such a bleak picture of modern @entity24 that its scriptwriter said she told @entity1 ' very straight ' that the ending needed to change			1
the @entity7 sold 125,000 copies in its first week on the market , becoming the fastest - selling hardback in the @entity24 for three years and the second biggest seller since records began in 1998			1
but , it had a mixed response from critics when it was first released in september			0
the @entity99 said it was ' unadventurous ' with a ' righteous social message ' , while the @entity101 said miss @entity1 had a ' sharp eye for vivid detail '			1
@entity105 writer @entity104 described it as : ' 500 pages of relentless socialist manifesto , masquerading as literature , crammed down your throat			0
' in 2013 a publisher admitted she turned down @entity1 's pseudonymous thriller @entity114 after finding it ' perfectly decent but quiet '			1
but when @entity1 was exposed as the author of the @entity119 ’s calling by the wife of one of her lawyers , sales soared			1
former @entity124 scriptwriter @entity123 told the @entity101 : ' i was very straight with @entity1 and told her that i needed to write a different ending , ' ' it 's still heartbreaking , but i had to find some kind of redemptive moment at the end of it all - a sense that after the tragedy , someone gets to stand with a slightly straighter back			1
' nobody wants a finger wagged in their face , and i learnt on @entity124 that if you just go ' grim , grim , grim ' , viewers will simply disengage			2
' however , changes to the storyline have not been limited to just its bleak ending			1
last week questions were raised over other edits to the plot , which some suggested were made in order to ramp up left - wing issues weeks before the @entity151			2
@entity153 mp and former foreign secretary sir @entity154 last week said the timing of the broadcast struck him as being ' very odd at least '			0
he said : ' in the run - up to a general election , the government quite rightly has to go into purdah and refrain from doing anything provocative			2
i think the @entity8 should have to apply the same criteria			0
' the drama does not mention any political parties but critics say the battle over @entity51 is a thinly disguised attack on the government 's welfare cuts , which will be one of the crucial issues for the may 7 election			2
the @entity7 sold 125,000 copies in its first week on the market , becoming the fastest - selling hardback in the @entity24 for three years and the second biggest seller since records began in 1998			1

she had been told by a partner in @entity1 ’s legal firm @entity224 , who told his wife ’s best friend , in a private conversation			2
