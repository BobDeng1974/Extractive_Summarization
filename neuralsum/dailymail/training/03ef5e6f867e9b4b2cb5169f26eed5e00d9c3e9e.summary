by @entity0 published : 18:49 est , 28 november 2012 updated : 05:23 est , 29 november 2012 keep your hair on , ladies , but the @entity4 has a new ’ do			1
or , to be more accurate , some of the long , luscious locks which we are accustomed to seeing swept back from her pretty face have been snipped into a sweeping fringe			2
@entity4 may have left only a handful of hair on the salon floor , but her new style has caused a sensation , dividing opinion and no doubt sparking a wave of copy - cat cuts			1
now , to most men , her haircut will probably seem insignificant , nothing more than a nod to fashion , or a whim on @entity4 ’s part			2
the @entity27 and @entity4 were cheered by members of the public during an appearance on the balcony of the @entity32 in @entity33 new ' do : @entity4 saw the funny side though as her blow dry blew across her face on the balcony but we ladies know that a woman ’s hair is a barometer for her emotions , and that a cut often signals a radical shift in an individual ’s life			1
many older women decide to chop their hair when going through the menopause , for example , while younger women change their look when something drastic has happened to them			1
for when i was 22 , i had my heart broken			2
really , truly , badly broken by someone i had really , truly loved and trusted , and who behaved abominably			2
in those days , i had long , red hair that had never been cut			1
it was so long that i could sit on it — some thought it my crowning glory , though my ex had always told me , in his affectionate way , that red - heads tended to go bald , and that he detested the flame - haired beauties celebrated by the artist @entity69 and the pre-raphaelites			2
at the time , i was too crushed to challenge him , but when the affair was over i decided i was going to change it			2
@entity33 mayor @entity74 also struggled with the strong wind			1
she said the royal visit was ' absolutely huge ' for the city despite being complemented on her new hairstyle , @entity4 appeared to be having second thoughts what did i do ? i went to @entity81 in @entity83 ’s @entity82 and asked them to cut it all off			1
i wanted to make the most radical alteration to my appearance i could think of			1
‘ do you want me to stop here ? or here ? ’ the hairdresser kept asking , anxiously , as he passed my collarbones , my shoulders , my chin			0
‘ no , ’ i snapped			0
i want it all off			0
’ when it was over , and i was the proud owner of a shiny new bob , he gave me back the longest swag of my hair , reverently woven into a plait and wrapped in tissue paper			1
‘ you could still wear it as a hair - piece , ’ he said , sadly			1
@entity33 mayor @entity74 said the royal visit will be remembered for generations @entity107 greets people during her visit to the @entity32 like @entity4 , i also asked for a fringe , because a fringe feels like a screen you can hide behind			1
while i loved my new look , the cut was a very public statement that something in my life had changed — and not everyone liked the new message i was sending out			1
people who had previously criticised me for being a shrinking violet decided i was now ‘ intimidating ’ and ‘ terrifying ’			0
while everyone has been talking about @entity4 ’s new hairstyle , some onlookers noted that her husband @entity127 ’s hair seems to be disappearing at a remarkable rate			1
once the proud possessor of a golden mop - top and a fringe eerily reminiscent of his late mother , now , at the age of 30 , he increasingly resembles his balding relatives — particularly his @entity136			0
perhaps he will soon join his father , prince @entity137 , in opting for a ‘ comb - over ’ to cover his bald spot			0
friends were shocked , and my mother , never one to mince her words , told me sadly that i ‘ had cut off my one real beauty ’			1
i felt like a newborn bird , lighter and ready to fly away into a different life			0
i wonder what new stage in her life @entity4 was contemplating , when she sat in the hairdresser ’s chair ? after all , she turned 30 in january , and this year has made several steps away from the natural , girlish look which so captivated prince @entity127 when they were both students at @entity154			0
her style , while always on the safe side , has become more assured			0
she has rung the changes with elegant chignons and a polished half - up half - down hairstyle during her recent tour of @entity161 — so perhaps the revamped locks are just the burnishing of her new royal style			1
or could there be something else going on ? predictably — given that she and @entity127 have now been married for a year - and - a - half , and he has spoken in the past about his desire for children — @entity4 ’s new cut has sparked speculation that she may be pregnant			1
( and if she is keeping a very important secret , then that demure long fringe is perfect for hiding behind )			0
@entity4 met 5 - month - old @entity174 who was named after her husband @entity127 as she walked through the @entity176 thousands of well wishers had braved the rain to greet @entity127 and @entity4 as they went on a walk about on their way to the senate house @entity127 and @entity4 both wrapped up against the @entity33 chill in smart wool coats @entity127 fuelled this speculation yesterday on the couple ’s first visit to their namesake city , @entity33 , when he delightedly accepted a @entity189 from a well - wisher			1
the tiny suit was emblazoned with a helicopter and the words ‘ @entity194 ’s little co-pilot ’ in honour of the @entity127 ’s job as an @entity198 pilot			0
new mother @entity199 , 27 , from @entity200 , @entity201 , who made the present , had brought her baby daughter , @entity203 , to see the royals			0
she said : ‘ i made it for when his little one comes along			0
he ’s a helicopter pilot , so his baby will think his daddy is cool			0
‘ when i gave it to him he said : “ i ’ll keep that			0
” ’ the @entity27 and @entity4 on a tour of @entity214 's resettlement centre in @entity33 @entity214 's was opened in 1995 in the basement of a baptist church and is named after @entity217 , who spent the last few years of his life sleeping under a motorway bridge on the @entity220 while such behaviour confirms @entity127 is broody , it does not , of course , prove @entity4 is pregnant			1
but , even if she is n’t expecting , i ’ll wager that she feels she is entering a new stage in her life , as a royal and a wife , rather than a @entity229 twentysomething - about - town			0
and those tumbling tresses are a key part of her identity — just as my own red locks are a part of mine			0
by coincidence , my decision to go short was made easier because of the fashion for bobbed hair set by @entity240 , @entity4 ’s mother - in - law			1
in the @entity242 , bobs became more fashionable than at any time since the @entity243			0
prince @entity127 , @entity27 and @entity107 , @entity4 meet shelter guest @entity244 at ' @entity245 ' , a night shelter @entity249 writer @entity248 ’s sparkling short story @entity247 describes how post-war young women kicked against their repressive @entity252 upbringing by cutting their hair			1
in fact , @entity254 only pretends she ’s going to bob her hair because she is angry at being dismissed as unattractive by boys			1
when she is tricked into going through with the cut , she is appalled to realise that her new look makes her hair lie ‘ in lank lifeless blocks on both sides of her suddenly pale face			1
it was ugly as sin			0
’ of course , this is always the big risk with any new hairstyle			2
not everyone admires @entity4 ’s new ’ do — even the @entity4 does n’t seem entirely convinced by it			0
yesterday she told a fan who complimented her on the style : ‘ i ’m not sure about it			0
it ’s a bit windy today			0
’ homeless catering manager @entity244 had his picture taken on a smartphone with the @entity27 and @entity4 after he made @entity4 blush by kissing her hand and calling her beautiful however , while she may not be sure of her new cut , her glowing skin and coy smile certainly imply she is pleased with something			2
for my part , i still had short hair when i met the man who became my husband and fell happily in love			2
he said that as my hair was such a pretty colour , it was a shame not to have as much of it as possible			2
having found my trips to the hairdresser quite expensive , i was relieved to be able to stop going			0
ever since , it has remained on the long side — but when i suggested that , now we have two teenage children , i should go for the chop , he reacted with horror			0
‘ no , please , never cut it again , ’ he said			2
