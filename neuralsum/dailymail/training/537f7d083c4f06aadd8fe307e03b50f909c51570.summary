by @entity0 published : 13:05 est , 1 may 2013 updated : 20:24 est , 1 may 2013 finding a meal big enough to feed a pack of hungry lions and their cubs is usually a difficult task			1
but there were no empty stomachs among this pride in @entity10 's @entity9 after they managed to hunt down an adult male giraffe			1
at least four lionesses and three cubs were pictured feasting on the unusual kill for days			1
dinner time : a pride of lions swarm over their unusual kill - an adult male giraffe feeding frenzy : at least three cubs and four lionesses fed on the giraffe for a number of days fresh meat : giraffes are not usually prey for lions due to their size and the fact they have a vicious kick it is believed the giraffe was either ill or wounded , otherwise it would be extremely difficult for lions to take down an animal which weighs on average 1,600kg and can stand up to 20ft tall			1
@entity37 wildlife photographer and safari guide @entity36 , who had been following the pride for months , said he was kept awake most of the night from the noise of the lions killing then fighting over the prey			2
@entity36 , from @entity44 , said : ' this was an adult bull giraffe , it must have been sick or wounded otherwise this particular pride , which i have spent many months with , would never have taken him down			2
' however it proved a huge larder for many days and , as it was quite cool , the meat did not go off too quickly			0
fresh meat : @entity52 and cold weather meant the kill kept the lions fed for several days in for the kill : photographer @entity36 said he heard the lions killing and fighting for their prey during the night in the wild : one of the lion cubs shakes himself dry as rain threatens to spoil the pride 's meal time ' watching the hierarchy on the dinner table was fascinating although with such a large feast the elders were not as robust as they normally are with the cubs			1
' giraffes are not easy prey for lions because of their height which makes them difficult to bring down			0
lions kill by grasping the throat of their prey and suffocating it , and they can not easily reach the throat of a giraffe whilst it is standing up			2
however , by working together lions can hunt and kill adult giraffes			0
they will often chase them onto rocky ground , where they can not keep their balance easily , hoping to trip them up			0
at other times they simply surround the giraffe and repeatedly attack it as a group until it falls , when they can seize its throat			0
giraffes also have a very powerful kick that can kill a lion so lions prefer to hunt easier prey such as antelope and zebra .			0
