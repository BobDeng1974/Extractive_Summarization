by @entity0 we all remember the controversial @entity3 campaign women who eat on tubes , the fat - shaming fad in which users uploaded anonymous pictures of women munching away on public transport , sparking outrage amongst women , feminists and @entity15 alike			1
however it seems that no matter what your size , you can come under fire - as a new @entity23 trend dubbed ' thin shaming ' proves			1
you did not eat that was set up in april by an anonymous user and regrams images of slender women posing with fatty foods with the hashtag @entity29 ( @entity31 ) - and has already gained a following of 96,576 people			1
because really ... @entity48 '			0
the account 's creator said she began the project because she was sick of seeing staged photos of women with thigh - gaps posing with almighty slices of pizza and thought it was about time someone called them up on it			1
recalling one particular instance that made her blood boil , she told @entity63 : ' a month ago i saw dozens of bloggers swarming a dessert table , taking pictures and spending five minutes merchandizing the sunglasses next to the macaroons			0
then they walked away and nothing was eaten			0
it was so contrived ! ' a lot of hot air ? @entity75 poses with cheesy souffles - but will she actually tuck in ? hard to swallow : @entity75 is known for her super-slender frame and clean eating , yet posts snaps of huge meals despite being adamant that her account is all in good humour , @entity31 has been met with severe criticism , with many claiming that it will only encourages stigmas around food			1
therapist @entity88 says that there could be something far deeper behind the desire to document a diet of high - fat foods			2
she worries that the reason for the photos could be @entity96 , whereby women order huge portions of food when out with others , but dramatically restrict their portions in private			1
' @entity96 can be a form of eating disorder , ' says @entity88 , ' it 's connected to feeling shame around food and it 's often sparked by fear of being challenged by other people			2
' yeah right : @entity108 poses with an all - american feast , yet the food seems untouched hungry for more : @entity112 digs into a whole pizza , but was she sharing ? unlikely candidate : @entity117 model @entity115 seems to be enjoying her steak and chip dinner despite this worrying information , @entity31 's creator insists that she is not targeting women , she simply wants to see a bit more honesty			2
' this is not me making some huge social commentary about what size somebody is and what they 're eating			0
this is more like , come on , we see the formula			0
you look awesome ! do n't lie about how you got there ! it 's fine			0
' @entity31 has received a backlash from several bloggers such as @entity140 and @entity141 from @entity142 and @entity143 , who blocked her account after being named and shamed			0
to see all of the accused visit instagram.com / youdidnoteatthat are you buying it ? @entity149 ( left ) and @entity150 ( right ) both posted feasts tucking in : is @entity153 ' enviable figure down to a fast food diet ? dubious ? @entity155 does n't seem to be enjoying her pizza enough to actually put it in her mouth			2

a new @entity23 account catches out the slim who pose with fatty foods
you did not eat that claims too many women do n't eat food they pose with
the account has already gained over 96,000 followers
therapists are concerned that it could lead to further stigmas around food
