by @entity0 lurking in the @entity2 forest lies the most unusual holiday hideaway , perfect for those travellers desperate to get away from it all			1
suspended above the forest floor , up among the trees , is an invisible room - a mirrored tree house hidden in the foliage			1
the hideaway can barely be seen , as reflections from the surroundings obscure the exclusive room			0
the @entity15 is the star attraction at the @entity17 , which also offers guests the chance to rent out a @entity20 and a bird house			2
the nearest house is 500metres away and owners @entity45 and @entity47 say stress quickly fades away as guests enjoy the peace and purity of unspoiled nature			0
but complete anonymity does n't come cheap - the unusual room costs £ 213 a night			1
that price includes breakfast at @entity57 and mrs @entity58 's guest house further into the forest but if you fancy something special , the couple will put on a traditional @entity2 three course meal including moose , reindeer and bear			2
but there is one problem with the room , birds can struggle to spot it too			0
to prevent birds from flying head - on into the mirrored walls , the four sides were clad with infrared film that only birds can see			0
while the invisible tree house has just enough room for two , the @entity78 can accommodate four who access via a retractable staircase			1
owners @entity45 and @entity47 say stress quickly fades away as guests enjoy the peace and purity of unspoiled nature the stunning luxury interior of the @entity15 features a queen size bed the minimalist interior is simple and tasteful , and guests can enjoy stunning views across the forest @entity93 and @entity58 offer guests the chance to stay at their exclusive tree house , for £ 213 a night and the eerie @entity20 can house two adults and two children for families who want a sci - fi themed holiday			1
mr @entity47 said : ' people appreciate sleeping high up in the trees with an incredible view and a feeling of freedom			0
' the architects were given complete free reign to create their design and it feels great to create a new reason for travelling to @entity2 and @entity110			2
' the hotel is built around the ecological values in which substantial resources have been devoted to finding sustainable construction and energy solutions			0
' the @entity15 appears to be suspended from the tree tops the mirrored sides can present problems for birds , but the four sides are clad in an infrared coating that only birds can see			1

the @entity15 is one of the tree house rooms available at @entity34 in @entity35 , @entity2
the invisible room appears to be suspended from the tree tops only spotted when the light catches its reflection
a night at the 4x4metre cube room , which comes with a queen - size bed , will set you back £ 213 a night
