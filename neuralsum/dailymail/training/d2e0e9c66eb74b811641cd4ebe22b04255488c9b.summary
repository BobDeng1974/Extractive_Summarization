it meant that during the 13 weeks leading up to their birth , @entity11 and @entity13 had to go to hospital every day - severely damaging their attendance at school			1

' i also had an interview for an accountancy apprenticeship when i found out i was pregnant			0
' it was a real shock because i was already 16 weeks gone but a few weeks later the doctors told us to get ready to go to @entity71 because the twins had twin - to - twin transfusion syndrome			2
