@entity1 should maintain its status as a gateway to @entity4 and become a launchpad to outer space to secure its long - term future , a new analysis has concluded			1
the @entity1 strategic vision said the @entity11 terminal 's association with @entity4 , some 35 miles away , is its ' best asset '			1
a local campaign to change its name to @entity17 , in recognition of the @entity20 - born bard , would ' damage the airport 's business prospects , notably with inbound passengers ' , it said			1
@entity24 is in need of modernisation as it aims to compete on the world stage officials at @entity29 believes the airport satisfies criteria to be the site of the @entity34 's first spaceport ( illustration ) the vision also confirms @entity29 's bid to be the site of the @entity34 's first spaceport , which it said will be ' the catalyst for transformational change '			1
in the meantime , @entity29 faces some challenges including aged infrastructure , a maintenance backlog , a railway station in need of a £ 4.75 million refurbishment , the need for a new primary radar within the next five years and @entity51 's expansion into @entity52			1
@entity54 airports are also ' disproportionally affected ' by air passenger duty ( @entity56 ) due to their geographic location and @entity29 is calling for changes to @entity34 aviation policy leading to a reduction in or removal of @entity56			1
@entity1 chief executive @entity62 said : ' we are currently under consideration to become @entity34 's first spaceport			1
a report has said that @entity1 is a vital link for the city of @entity4 ' we satisfy - and in some cases exceed - all the essential criteria such as infrastructure , weather and airspace , and securing spaceport status would be the catalyst for transformational change at the airport - from boosting revenue from space - related flight testing , establishing an attractive modernised hi - tech image and bringing in visitors and tourists			1
' it will also bring significant economic benefits to both @entity11 and @entity54			0
' plans to rename @entity1 the @entity86 have been criticised , despite the bard being @entity54 's most famous poet @entity29 spaceport would be a magnet for tourists , industrial tenants , payload operators and sub-technology businesses , the report said			1
it added : ' @entity1 is a well - recognised name and its best asset is the @entity4 mention			2
' removing it will weaken its link with its main origination and destination market , being @entity4			2
' the airport will explore opportunities which may include the incorporation of a @entity108 theme to form part of the general re-positioning of the airport landside area			0
' the report notes that @entity1 was built in the 1960s and ' the infrastructure is aged '			1
' in recent years the capital expenditure has mainly been focused on areas that were viewed as essential to maintain a safe and secure asset and keep the airport operational , ' it said			0
' this approach has resulted in a maintenance backlog in certain areas and also highlighted that there are some critical items of equipment which are coming close to end of life and will need replacement			0
' the airport has developed a structured capital plan that will address much of the infrastructure backlog issues over the next few years			0
' this excluded the costs in relation to the rail station			0
' it also excludes the replacement costs of the existing primary radar which will be required within the next five years , though alternative funding options are being considered in relation to this			0
' @entity140 , based in @entity141 : could @entity4 host the @entity34 's equivalent ? @entity29 is in need of improvement , and remains a key component of @entity54 's aviation market it added : ' there is a significant need to refurbish the rail station and skywalk connecting it to the airport , with initial estimates of this being up to £ 4.75 million			1
' it continued : ' @entity54 airports have been disproportionally affected by @entity56 due to geographic location and therefore a comprehensive route development solution will be crucial to support the proposed passenger growth			0
@entity160 , @entity54 @entity161 , @entity54 @entity162			0
@entity54 @entity163 , @entity54 @entity1 , @entity54 @entity164 , @entity54 @entity165 , @entity166 @entity167 , @entity168 ' major growth will only be achievable if a substantial @entity56 mitigation plan and route development support are put in place			2
' the @entity54 government bought the struggling airport for £ 1 last year and later announced £ 10m in loan funding			0
the cash was committed towards operating costs , a repairs backlog and to make improvements to the terminal building			0
in july 2014 @entity51 announced the establishment of a base at @entity52 in addition to @entity29 and @entity184			2
the immediate impact was ' an overall reduction in passenger volumes from the airport which has an adverse impact on its immediate revenue generating capabilities ' , it said			0
deputy first minister @entity191 said : ' we have been clear from the start of this process that there is no quick fix for the airport but there are opportunities to improve in all areas of the business , from increasing passenger and freight traffic to putting forward a bid for the @entity34 spaceport programme			2
' we are confident there is a place for @entity1 in the evolving @entity54 aviation market and look forward to seeing it grow and develop in the future			2
