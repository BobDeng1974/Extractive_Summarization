an artist who turns dead animals into unique works of art has recently come under fire for his bizzare sculptures			1
@entity6 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , said he picked up his distinctive style after his family taught him about hunting and taxidermy on the farm he grew up on			1
‘ taxidermy was a big part of my culture , ’ he told @entity14			2
‘ as a kid you would watch the eyes following you around the room and i think that became a bit of a fascination for me , you know , capturing the animal in a precise moment , almost frozen in time			0
’ while some religious folk have taken issue with the fact mr @entity6 is ' manipulating the animal ' by using animal parts in his work , he maintains that he ’s only used parts that would have otherwise gone to waste			1
‘ we do n’t really select the animals			0
they are a product of hunting for meat or pest control			1
’ he said he can understand why some people find his work ' a bit ungodly ’ , but in his opinion , there is nothing worse than ‘ art that does n't affect you at all			0
’ ‘ it ’s one of those things that people either like or they do n’t , ’ he said			0
mr @entity6 said he ’s been influenced by @entity64 architecture and literature that dealt with themes of being dismantled and put back together taxidermy : ‘ it ’s one of those things that people either like or they do n’t ’ mr @entity6 has three animal sculptures currently on display at @entity73 at @entity74 on @entity76 's lower north shore			1
@entity6 said his interest in taxidermy started at a very young age as he watched his family hunt on their farm he chose a running rabbit , a standing rabbit and a small bird enclosed in a metal cage for the @entity31 exhibition called ' untitled '			1
the bird is intact while the rabbit sculptures only feature half the animal with mr @entity6 expertly manipulating steel beams to make the sculpture whole			2
he said he spends a lot of time studying the anatomy and posture of each animal to make sure his ' twist ' on classical sculpting is as authentic as possible			0
‘ i am building the surface , not out of stone , but through an accurate mapping of the rest of the animal , ’ he said			0
mr @entity6 said he ’s been influenced by @entity64 architecture and literature , like @entity106 or @entity107 and mr @entity107 , that dealt with themes of being dismantled and put back together			0
he said using animals has let him add another ‘ natural ’ layer to his steel structures			0
mr @entity6 travelled to @entity76 from his @entity8 home to personally deliver three of his controversial sculptures , where he said he got ‘ quite a reaction ’ on opening night			1
mr @entity6 said he spends a lot of time studying the anatomy and posture of each animal to make sure his ' twist ' on classical sculpting is as authentic as possible ‘ i am building the surface , not out of stone , but through an accurate mapping of the rest of the animal ’ @entity124 , a curator at @entity73 , said his clients have had a great response to the unique ‘ amalgam of sculpture and taxidermy ’			1
‘ to be honest all of our clients have quite enjoyed it , people can be grossed out a bit but i think they are more interested in the end			0
’ he said once museum visitors learned that the animals were n't killed for art , they were much more accepting of the animal and steel hybrids			2
in his most recent work , mr @entity6 was commissioned to build the @entity143 for @entity144 , which will be unveiled on april 25 at the @entity145 in @entity146			2

@entity6 has been *criticised* for using dead animals in his sculptures
his interest in taxidermy started through hunting on his farm as a child
all the animals used were killed in @entity8 as a part of pest control
his work is currently on display at @entity73 in @entity74
museum curators said his work is being received well in @entity31
