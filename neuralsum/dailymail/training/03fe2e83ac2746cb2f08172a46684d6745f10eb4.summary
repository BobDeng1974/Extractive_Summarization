six months after her boyfriend went missing on @entity2 , an @entity4 woman is losing faith that the plane will ever be found - believing something in the investigation is being covered up			1
@entity10 's boyfriend @entity9 , 50 , was one of 239 passengers and crew on the flight from @entity14 to @entity15 , which mysteriously disappeared off radar last march 8			1
despite a massive search effort , no sign of the plane was ever found			2
now @entity10 and other family members of the missing passengers are demanding raw data on the disappearance be released for independent analysis , no longer trusting the @entity26 investigation			1
loss : @entity27 's ( left ) boyfriend @entity9 ( right ) was one of 239 people on board @entity2 , which went missing last march 8 cover up : @entity10 believes the investigation into the flight 's disappearance is being sabotaged , and that the plane may never be found unless an independent investigation stars			1
above , a stock image of a @entity38 plane ' i think that if the existing investigation team is left in charge … we may not ever find the plane			2
because i believe there are active steps being taken to interfere with finding the plane , ' @entity10 told @entity47			1
@entity10 says she is n't sure how much is being covered up , but knows something is being concealed			1
' failure to release information - whether its obfuscation , you know , actually covering something up - or dishonesty … creating false evidence or just hiding something , right ? we do n’t know why or what is being covered up , but something is being covered up , ' she added			2
fruitless : @entity58 forces helped lead a search for the plane in the @entity61 last @entity62 which turned up no new clues			0
above , captain flt lt @entity64 of the @entity65 trying to locate the missing plane she also criticized the @entity58 governments role in the investigation , after they stepped in to lead @entity61 search			0
she said the @entity58 should be ' embarrassed ' for targeting a dead - end search based on underwater pings , and for not forcing the @entity26 government to release all of their records			0
since the search has found no clues as to what happened to the plane , @entity10 and the other family members hold out hope that some of the passengers may still be alive , no matter how small a chance			1
on monday , many of these family members gathered at the @entity87 in @entity14 to hold a prayer vigil for the missing passengers			0
remembering : on monday , family members of the missing @entity2 passengers father at @entity92 in @entity14 to pray on the six - month anniversary of the flight 's disappearance grief : above , more family members cry publicly at the prayer vigil at @entity92 in @entity99 on monday several looked overwrought with emotion , as they cried in public for their missing loved one			1
the fruitless investigation has left @entity105 without closure , and she says she will continue to press for answers as long as their is no evidence her boyfriend died			0
' i think it ’s a very real possibility that @entity9 is still alive because there is no proof that he ’s dead			0
and so i will continue to push to find proof , one way or the other and at some point in time , if a body is brought to me or even confirmed wreckage of the airplane , then i will acquiesce to the fact that he ’s not coming back			0
' but until then i will continue to push and many , many family members feel the same , ' she said			0
pressing for answers : @entity10 says she will continue to hold out home her boyfriend survived , until she is given evidence otherwise			2
