the mercury plunged to @entity13 in @entity14 and the bitter weather remains colder than the @entity17 capital , which is enjoying @entity18			1
and it looks like @entity20 - due to officially start on march 1 - could also be on the back - burner , as the @entity22 warns much of the next month will also be colder than usual			1

the weekend saw temperatures of @entity34 ( @entity35 ) in the north of @entity37 , with several inches of snow falling along the eastern coast a walker trudges through the snow in @entity43			1
the @entity3 weather looks set to continue , with the risk of below - average temperatures persisting until the end of the week - and into march @entity23 covered fields near @entity43			1
forecasters have warned there is no sign of @entity20 yet , with brisk winds making it feel much cooler and last night in @entity55 , in @entity56 , temperatures dipped to -7.6c overnight			1
@entity11 experienced lows of -6c			0
the weekend saw temperatures of @entity34 ( @entity35 ) in the north of @entity37 , with several inches of snow falling along the eastern coast , blown in by the so - called ‘ @entity63 ’ weather system			1
despite the chill , party goers in @entity66 braved the icy pavements dressed only in high heels and skimpy dresses over the weekend , without an extra layer in sight			2
the changing of the seasons will be greeted with snow flurries and frosts , forecasters have warned			1
the @entity22 , which considers march 1 as the first day of spring , also warned there could be more of the snow that hit the east of the country over the weekend , as the mercury hovered just above freezing in most areas			1
february 's full moon , which will be visible tonight , has long been dubbed the ' @entity85 ' , because february was often the snowiest month of the year , particularly in @entity86			0
this fun - loving squirrel caused a stir when he was photographed with a frosty dusting on his nose amid the thick snowfall in the @entity93 the cheeky chap looks ready to start a snowball fight as he gathers up the chilly powder in between his paws but the chilly weather seems to have finally taken it out of him as he retires to a branch to try and get some shut - eye the @entity22 has issued a yellow alert level two - which is triggered to let health and social care providers know when there is a risk that extreme weather could affect services			1
it said : ' during monday , although still feeling very cold across southern areas in strong winds at times , less cold air is expected to move in , allowing temperatures to recover somewhat			0
' further north , the cold conditions are expected to hang on , although colder night time minima may be offset by sunnier periods by day			0
there is a risk of icy conditions at times , especially across the north			0
' a spokesman added : ' the below average temperatures look likely to last throughout march			1
' although generally temperatures are expected to rise , they are going to be likely to be below average for the month			1
' despite the cold weather over the past week there has been no frost because the clouds covering the @entity7 have acted as a blanket , the @entity22 has said			2
while much of the @entity7 has ' felt much colder than any other time this winter ' , there has not been the right ' ingredients ' for a long hard frost			0
it said : ' for a classic frosty night we need a few ingredients : low temperatures , clear skies , calm winds and moisture			0
' a clear , calm night gives excellent radiation conditions – by this we mean that the heat absorbed by the @entity149 ’s surface during the day escapes readily back into space and allows temperatures to fall			0
' if the temperature falls to the dew point ( the temperature to which air must cool for it to become saturated with water vapour ) moisture will condense and form droplets on the ground ’s surface			0
when temperatures fall below freezing the droplets freeze and we get frost			0
' it said thick cloud cover was stopping temperatures from falling too much below freezing			0
it said : ' the wind is also important as it mixes the lower part of our atmosphere			0
rather than having cold air pooling in one place and causing low temperatures , the wind can bring less cold air from another location or even bring it down from the upper atmosphere			0
' this also helps to keep temperatures from falling too low			0
however , easterly winds this week have certainly made it feel very cold indeed ! ' these girls were seemingly oblivious to the freezing temperatures as they enjoyed a night out in @entity66 two girls get out of a cab before a night out in @entity66 city centre painting the toon red : four girls in party gear on a night out walk down an icy road chilly : the whole country was feeling the chill as flurries of snow drift in from the east today there is likely to be more snow across @entity37 and @entity198 , with areas of high ground , especially in the @entity201 , most at risk			1
temperatures will be slightly warmer , with highs of @entity205 ( 45f ) in the @entity207 and @entity208 ( @entity206 ) in the @entity201 , but high winds from the @entity201 will make the temperature feel more like @entity18 ( 30f ) or @entity211 ( 28f )			2
@entity22 forecaster @entity212 said : ‘ cold weather looks to continue through much of the next week , with brisk winds in the @entity201 accentuating the cold			2
‘ we could see a few snow flurries from time to time , particularly across the @entity201			2
overnight temperatures will fall to @entity13 ( @entity219 )			2
’ @entity220 of @entity221 said : ‘ long term , looking into march it ’s unlikely we ’ll get any warmer spring - like weather any time soon			0
this is because of the north - westerly winds blowing down from the @entity3 , which look likely to persist			0

@entity22 says temperatures likely to be below average throughout march
at @entity55 , in @entity56 , temperatures dipped to -7.6 *°* c overnight
whole country will feel the chill as flurries of snow drift in from @entity17
@entity237 may see bright patches and temperatures of @entity34
