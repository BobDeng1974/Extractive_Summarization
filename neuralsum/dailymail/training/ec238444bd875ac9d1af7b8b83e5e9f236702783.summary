@entity0 may have taken the limelight following its landing on comet @entity3 , but its orbiting spacecraft , @entity5 , still has a few of its own daring manoeuvres to complete			1
in february , flight engineers in @entity9 , @entity10 plan to bring the @entity5 spacecraft down to an incredible 4 miles ( 6km ) from the comet 's surface			1
this will be the closest the comet explorer will come to @entity16 throughout its mission , and could provide stunning views of the cliffs and craters			1
its orbit currently ranges between 12.4 miles and 18.6 miles ( 20 km and 50 km ) as it monitors the comet 's surface , attempting to find @entity0 's final resting spot			1
any manoeuvre to bring @entity5 to the comet is risky , but a low flyby could provide scientists with an opportunity to obtain imagery with a resolution of a few inches ( 10 cm ) per pixel			1
' it is the earliest we could carry it out without impacting the vitally important bound orbits that are currently being flown , ' said @entity45 , the @entity46 scientist from the @entity47 , @entity48 , the @entity49			0
closing in : this artist 's impression of @entity5 and @entity16 show previous orbits that edge in closer to the comet 's surface			1
up until now , @entity5 's closet view of the comet has been six miles ( 10 km ) bounce back : the blurry image captures the rapid motion in which @entity0 was launched back out into space			1
the probe was launched to a height of 0.62 miles ( 1km ) and then to a much lower height of 65ft ( 20 metres ) the @entity5 probe , which was carrying @entity0 , launched into space in 2004 , using the gravity of @entity64 and @entity65 to slingshot its way towards comet @entity3			1
it chased comet @entity68 – @entity69 through space for more than ten years , and entered orbit in august 2014			0
after a four billion mile ( 6.5 billion km ) journey , the probe then successfully released the @entity0 lander from its grip to land on the comet on 12 november 2014 , travelling at 1 metre ( 40 inches ) per second relative to the comet			1
but when it first made contact with the surface it failed to fire harpoons that would have kept it attached to the comet			0
this resulted in it bouncing to a height of 0.62 miles ( 1km ) above the comet before again landing on the surface			0
it then bounced again , but to a much lower altitude			0
scientists recently said that water on the comet was different to that on @entity64 - suggesting water on our world came from an asteroid , not a comet			2
' as the comet becomes more and more active , it will not be possible to get so close to the comet			2
so this opportunity is very unique			0
' the imagery is expected to provide information on the comet 's porosity and albedo – or how much it reflects sunlight			0
the flyby will also allow the study of the processes by which cometary dust is accelerated by the cometary gas emission			0
' @entity5 is providing us with a grandstand seat of the comet throughout the next year			2
this flyby will put us track side - it 's going to be that close , ' said dr @entity45			0
last week , scientists revealed the dramatic moment that @entity5 's @entity0 comet lander bounced back into space has been captured in a remarkable image			1
@entity0 successfully landed on comet @entity126 , but not before a failure to launch its harpoons and a thruster caused it to bounce twice before settling			2
the blurry image captures the rapid motion in which @entity0 was bounced back			2
the probe was launched to a height of 0.62 miles ( 1km ) and then to a much lower height of 65ft ( 20 metres ) before coming to rest			0
true colours : the @entity138 revealed the true colour of @entity16 ( left )			2
on the right is an image taken taken by a @entity5 instrument dubbed @entity143 reflection : this image , named ' @entity146 ' , shows a wall next to the robot , with reflections from @entity0 @entity151 scientists also revealed a reprocessed @entity153 image taken by @entity0 at the @entity155 's @entity154 in @entity156			1
the image , named ' @entity146 ' , depicts one of the walls looming over the robot , with reflections from @entity0 shown by glare marks			0
@entity153 took sharper images of the @entity16 's terrain , but these were taken after the probe had fallen into a dark ditch , unable to get the sunlight it needed to recharge its batteries			2
another image shows a reconstruction a model of @entity0 's final landing location			0
@entity5 engineers claim the plucky probe could come back to life as soon as march next year , as comet @entity16 gets closer to the sun. toppled : in this graphic , @entity153 images have been used to construct a model of the final landing location			1
scientists described the ground as being more like a ' trampoline ' than rock , owing to its soft and powdery texture , which may have caused the unsteady landing			0

this will be the closest @entity5 will come to @entity16 throughout its mission
scientists will be able to take images at a few inches ( 10 cm ) per pixel
as the comet becomes more active , it will not be possible to get so close
last week , scientists released stunning views of a cliff close to @entity0
