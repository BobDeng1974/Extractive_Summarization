@entity0 was left to round on referee @entity1 and the media after a dismal performance at @entity4 followed hot on the heels of tuesday night 's @entity7 capitulation against @entity8			1
@entity9 went down 2 - 0 against the @entity11 side , who unceremoniously dumped them out of the @entity14			1
@entity0 clearly took issue with the reporting of his comments about the club 's fans , telling the post-match media conference : ' the problem is you , not me			1
if we close @entity9 - if we put a @entity41 @entity40 around the city - it would be fantastic			1
' now when we let you in and you get out and say what you want we 've got a problem			0
i invite every @entity9 fan and people around the club not to listen to any one of you - only to me			2
' @entity0 even took issue with a question about the absence of @entity53 , responding : ' you need to know too many things and we try not to give you too much information			2
' he was injured , he got a little problem on his calf and we do n't know how long it is going to take			0
' @entity0 's mood was not improved by his reaction to the performance of @entity1 , whom he believed denied @entity9 a clear first - half penalty after @entity64 tackled @entity65 in the box			1
@entity0 added : ' we tried our best and i think no regrets because everybody put in their best effort and their best ability to play under the circumstances			2
' they found a goal from an action that can happen in any game			0
then when we started understanding a way to hurt @entity4 , at that moment we needed to score and the referee needed to do his job and he did n't			0
' @entity81 ( right ) celebrates netting @entity4 's second goal in the 2 - 0 victory over @entity9 @entity0 ( left ) with @entity30 ( right ) after the match and the manager said he has ' no regrets ' about the game however , @entity0 did refrain from following up his comments earlier this week about the poor state of @entity4 's pitch - and was magnanimous in his praise of the @entity11 side 's performance			1
he added : ' i 'm not going to complain about the pitch - we did n't lose because of the pitch			0
' @entity4 won at @entity97 on a great pitch and today they played here and beat us on this pitch so you need to give plenty of credit to what they do			0

@entity9 's *season* hit another low after a 2 - 0 @entity14 *defeat* to @entity4
but manager @entity0 said ' the problem is you , not me ' to the media
@entity9 lost at home to @entity8 in the league in *midweek*
