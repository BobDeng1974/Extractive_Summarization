by @entity1 reporter published : 23:34 est , 16 november 2013 updated : 08:19 est , 17 november 2013 a @entity3 sinkhole that has sucked in trees and swamps as it spread to the size of 20 football fields is now at risk of exploding			2
residents of @entity11 were evacuated a year ago when the sinkhole , which is emitting natural gases , opened up			1
the gas exploration company that has been blamed for causing the problem after a mine collapsed , has resorted to digging relief wells to try to disperse the gas			1
expanding : the @entity11 sinkhole covers 24 acres and has been sucking in trees and swamp explosive : natural gas building up in the sinkhole could cause it to ignite like this one in @entity25 evacuated : @entity11 was once home to 350 residents but only a few have remained @entity3 state is suing @entity29 as it tries to recoup $ 8 million used to deal with the sinkhole , including bringing in a team of scientists , according to @entity33			1
while no homes have yet been sucked in , officials warn that the gases being emitted could ignite , which would leave the @entity3 swamp looking like ' the @entity38 '			2
in a similar case , a crater caused by @entity41 geologists drilling in @entity25 in the 1970s has been a fiery pit for more than 40 years after the natural gases being released were lit. the @entity3 sinkhole , which is expected to expand to 50 acres , is currently 25 acres wide and 350ft deep in some points			2
methane bubbling up from it has also escaped into an aquifer			0
experts fear that if oil and gas rising to the surface became trapped it could build up in a crevice and then explode			2
what lies beneath : oil and natural gas surface at the sinkhole which opened up last year fire pit : if the natural gas ignited the sinkhole could become like the @entity62 in @entity25 , which has been alight for 40 years risk : a sign warns of the potential risk caused by the build up of gas @entity68 , who is part of the parish 's emergency preparedness team , said about 6 million cubic feet of natural gas was trapped beneath the surface			1
he said only 5 per cent needed to get in the air for it to ignite			0
scientists are constantly monitoring the affected region and several weeks ago noticed a rise in micro-earthquake activity , from an average of 10 to 15 a day to 326 in one 24 - hour period			0
the sinkhole appeared overnight in august last year , when the wall of a salt mine 5,000ft underground collapsed , sucking in surrounding water and releasing gas			1
because it allegedly knew the risks involved with deep drilling , @entity88 's insurance has refused to pay out , according to @entity91			0
the natural gas company has bought up about 60 properties which it plans to demolish to make way for outlets so the build up of gas can release			1
anger : residents who have lost their homes and community protest over the sinkhole , caused when a mined salt cavern collapsed protest : lawn ornaments outside a @entity11 house are used to hit back at @entity29 , the company blamed for the problem repairing the damage : @entity29 is drilling release wells to try to safely disperse the natural gas a mandatory evacuation was issued to the parish 's 300 residents , but many are still paying their mortgages and utility bills , and some have even refused to leave their homes			1
@entity119 stayed on after the evacuation but said he is now ready to leave			0
' we were planning on retiring here			0
now , instead of coming up and enjoying the weekend , sitting on the patio drinking a few glasses of wine , we wake up in the morning and we go look for houses			0
that â€™s the new reality , ' he said			0
@entity29 has issued regular updates on its efforts to tackle the problem			1
in the latest statement , released on november 14 , it said : ' over the past 15 months , @entity131 has been committed to responding to this incident and mitigating any impact to the environment , while supporting a community in need and continuing efforts to understand potential risks involved with the sinkhole			0
' expanding : no homes have been sucked in yet but trees are pulled under as the hole expands slow progress : residents affected by the disaster demand help a year after the sinkhole opened up			2
