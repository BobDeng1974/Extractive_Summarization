@entity0 appearing to bite @entity2 defender @entity1 during the @entity3 shocked the football community and will certainly live long in the memory			1
now , just a few months on , some fans have amusingly recreated the infamous incident using the new @entity9 15 game			0
in pictures posted to @entity12 , fans have claimed the game is ‘ so realistic ’ for letting them relive the moment that saw the @entity16 striker banned from football for four months			2
@entity0 's apparent bite on @entity2 defender @entity1 during the @entity3 shocked football and earned the frontman a lengthy ban fans have recreated the now infamous incident of @entity0 's bite on the newly released @entity9 15 game ‘ @entity9 is so realistic ’ said one @entity12 user beneath an image that sees @entity0 sinking his teeth into @entity30 's @entity29			1
‘ was playing the @entity34 earlier got to say its pretty damn realistic , ’ said another tweeter under an image of @entity0 and new @entity16 team - mate @entity33			0
of course , the ability to bite a player is not actually a feature of the new game			0
instead , the gamers have used the game ’s replay mode to spot some odd player collision moments in the game			0
the glitches seem to show @entity0 ’s mouth sinking into players , and it does n’t help his case that in some his eyes are closed and teeth bared in an apparent biting action			0
one fan on @entity12 joked that @entity9 15 was so realistic beneath a graphic of @entity0 appearing to bite @entity30 defender @entity29 @entity0 signed for @entity16 from @entity54 after the @entity3 in a £ 75million deal			1
however he is still yet to make his competitive debut as he continues to serve his ban for biting @entity1			0
and that is replicated in @entity9 15 - fans picking up the game will be unable to use @entity0 in the game ’s career mode for the entirety of his ban			1
however playing one of the game 's other modes that has full squads available without suspensions - such as an exhibition one - on - one against another gamer - allows the hilarious images to be taken			2
@entity0 's real - life ban until october 26 is replicated on the new @entity9 15 game when users play as @entity16 @entity79 's @entity78 plays a game of @entity9 15 with a young fan following the game 's release			1

images from the @entity87 15 video game appear to show the @entity89 striker biting other football players
@entity0 was infamously banned for four months during the @entity3 for seeming to bite @entity93 defender @entity1
fans have taken to @entity12 *mocking* the striker with images from the game
it is not really a new feature , but rather a result of gamers positioning players in the game to make it look like another biting incident
in the game 's career mode @entity0 is serving his real - life ban until october
