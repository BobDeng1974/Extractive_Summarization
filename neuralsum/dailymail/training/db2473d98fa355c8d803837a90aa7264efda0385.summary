a deserted airport customs lounge , luggage weighed by hand on an old fashioned scale and a cockpit with no digital assistance , are just some of the sites a photographer from @entity8 has captured on camera after flying with the world ’s only one - star airline			1
@entity12 gained unprecedented access to the @entity15 - era planes still used in @entity16 by the nation ’s civil carrier , @entity19 , plus cargo transporters and helicopters , after joining a tour for aviation enthusiasts inside the communist enclave			1
from the photos , the airline , which was founded in 1950 as a joint @entity16 - @entity15 partnership to connect the capital @entity28 with @entity29 , appears to be stuck in a time warp			1
the @entity15 aircraft was first flown in 1957 inside the cockpit of the @entity36 - 18 things looks very different to modern planes , there is not a digital screen in sight the cockpit in the @entity36 plane , a large turboprop airliner that first flew in 1957 , is a long way from digital			1
astonishingly , the flight ’s communication officer appears to sit in the passenger seating area and listens in to air traffic control on an ancient pair of headphones			0
while the @entity36 is known for its durability , with many planes achieving over 45,000 flight hours , there is a bold contrast in its appearance to modern aircrafts			1
@entity63 , an airline review service , rated @entity19 a dismal one - star but gave it three stars for ' staff grooming and presentation '			2
and in march 2006 , due to safety and maintenance concerns , @entity19 was banned from flying into the @entity71			1
in march 2010 , the airline was allowed to resume operations but only with their tu - 204s aircraft			0
‘ at first i was a little nervous about flying , ’ mr @entity12 , who was on his third trip to @entity16 , told @entity76			1
however , he said after his first flight in a historic plane ‘ it was n’t scary at all ’			0
baggage check - in is a lot more old fashioned at @entity83 , a military airport near @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity16 an @entity19 flight to @entity87 , the main airport serving @entity16 , shows its ready for boarding			1
mr @entity12 flew from @entity89 into @entity28 with @entity19 on the 25 august the new modernised @entity87 is nearing completion and looks set to open in 2015 ' i was constantly looking forward to the next joyride			1
besides … there were 48 other members of the tour group and everyone was like a kid in the candy store			0
i could n’t possibly be nervous with everyone so psyched up about every ride , ’ he added			0
mr @entity12 flew out to @entity16 with @entity102 based company @entity101 , who have been running @entity16 aviation tours for the past three years			1
‘ the @entity16 is now the only country in the world where you can reliably fly on all major @entity15 era aircraft in one place , ’ their website informs			2
from the 11 - 20 september , the flyers experienced eight different aircraft types on both scheduled international and internal charter flights			0
inside the @entity36 there are blue chairs and blue carpet			2
curtains draw across the windows and overhead luggage is stored less securely than in modern planes not enough leg room ? seats on the @entity36 all fold down			2
but entertainment is limited to only one channel playing their @entity16 dramas and documentaries , mr @entity12 revealed the in - flight meal featured rice and chicken and fruit cocktail for desert			1
' the food is better than i expected , ' mr @entity12 commented in mr @entity12 ’s revealing photos , he shows the empty airport customs area at @entity28 , the main airport serving @entity16 , as well as a glimpse at the revamped @entity87 which looks set to open in 2015			1
a new airport is n’t the only update @entity16 is making to its airline			2
in 2013 , @entity19 appeared to be making efforts to update its image to the outside world , changing the uniforms worn by flight attendants from red and white to navy blue with a white studded trim			2
flight attendants smile in the smart outfits in mr @entity12 ’s photos , their black hair swept back into chic buns			2
' the air stewardess are polite and soft spoken			0
from what i understand , they never leave the plane to change shifts at @entity89 , ’ mr @entity12 said after his international flight			1
inside the plane , entertainment is limited to only one channel playing their @entity16 dramas and documentaries but the seats do fold down for extra leg room			1
in the services area of the @entity36 , a steward prepared the meals metal containers			2
unlabelled bottled water was stored in a tub the female flight attendants served drinks from plastic cups			0
in 2013 some of the attendants ' uniforms changed from red and white to navy blue with studded white trim life vests are stored under the seats of the @entity36 in case of emergencies			0
the toilet area features an old fifties interior mr @entity12 has previously visited @entity16 twice , and in 2013 he witnessed bustling markets , men and women enjoying themselves at a @entity191 looking water park and miles and miles of crops ready for harvest , shattering all of his illusions about what a holiday to @entity16 would entail			1
this time he said his trip was ' a very different experience ' because he was n't on his own with just official guides to keep him company			0
‘ i ended up being the odd one out … it was like i attended a @entity206 convention and everybody was speaking @entity208			0
these guys absolutely love and know their planes , ’ mr @entity12 said of joining the aviation fans			1
‘ the tour group were all over the runway , happily snapping away at the planes			0
and the @entity16 government did n’t even mind one bit , ’ he said			0
in one of mr @entity12 ’s videos the tour group is seen running across the runway in a dash to get the best seats on the plane			2
and despite @entity16 being known as highly - secretive , the photographer believes his latest tour shows things are becoming more open			0
‘ it 's a huge leap forward in terms of relaxing the rules			0
everyone was even allowed into the cockpits to take photos , ’ he said			0
the communications officer on the flight sat outside the cockpit in the passenger area and listened in with an ancient looking pair of headphones the old green seats in the @entity36 cockpit are covered with beige material			2
the empty weight of the plane is 35,000 kg mr @entity12 also took a flight on the @entity244 made @entity245			1
' i 'm told this particular plane is only 4 years old , ' he said the safety instructions on board the flights were in both @entity16 and @entity251 mr @entity12 said : ' the air stewardess are polite and soft spoken			1
from what i understand , they never leave the plane to change shifts at @entity89 ' toilets in the @entity245 were ' clean ' and had ' no foul smell '			1
mr @entity12 flew into @entity28 again with @entity259 on 13 september @entity16 has recently been plagued by speculation after its leader @entity261 , who is usually widely - photographed , had not been seen since september 3			1
on tuesday , the @entity264 regime ’s ambassador to the @entity102 became one of the first to offer a direct answer to increasing questions over his whereabouts			0
the lack of public appearances of the 32 - year - old has led to speculation that he is either ill or even that he has been deposed			0
but he is healthy - and ‘ there is no doubt about it ’ , one of the country ’s most senior officials has insisted			0
in the five weeks since mr @entity261 was last seen in the state media at a concert , he has missed several high - profile events that he normally attends			0
an official documentary released late last month then made a single reference to mr @entity261 's ' discomfort ' and showed video footage from august of him overweight and limping			0
however , speaking to the @entity287 , the @entity16 ambassador devoted more time to questions about human rights abuses than to the whereabouts of the country 's leader			2

a red , white and blue @entity19 shuttle boss transports passengers from the terminal to the planes the airport customs area looks remarkably quiet in @entity16 and only one man appears to be working at the desks mr @entity12 boarded a night flight at @entity87 with 49 other passengers from 13 different countries he took a flight on @entity19 's @entity309 , a @entity15 - designed medium twin - turbine transport helicopter while flying mr @entity12 believes he spotted a @entity312 plane sharing the same skies			1
