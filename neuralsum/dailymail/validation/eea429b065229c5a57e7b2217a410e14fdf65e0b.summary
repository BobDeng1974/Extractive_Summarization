the @entity0 has been the loudest opponent of the @entity2 in @entity3 switching to a winter tournament — staged from november 21 to december 18 — that will be rubber - stamped at the @entity7 meeting in @entity8 on friday			1
but the richest league in world football is not expected to kick off yet again when the dates become official this week			2
the @entity0 is resigned to that decision being a formality since the opinions of @entity0 chief executive @entity15 and other @entity17 leagues chiefs were virtually ignored at the task force summit in @entity3 which recommended a november - december competition			1
the dates from the @entity2 in @entity3 are expected to be confirmed on friday in @entity8 @entity3 will host the @entity2 in the winter despite opposition from @entity24 's big leagues instead , the @entity0 and their @entity17 counterparts will be concentrating on winning concessions for such a disruption to their calendar			1
the biggest confrontation is likely to be with their own @entity24 confederation over tightening the @entity33 programme			0
this not only spreads itself over a ridiculous four weeks for their last - 16 round but also forbids domestic fixtures taking place on those nights			0
the @entity0 will also be wanting talks about cutting international friendlies , @entity44 replays and two - legged @entity46 semi-finals in that season			1
but more conflict looks inevitable as the @entity44 and @entity46 will not want their broadcasting deals affected by losing fixtures			0
however , a december 18 finish would see the @entity0 restart on @entity52			1
@entity0 chief executive @entity15 has been among the loudest critics of a winter @entity2 the @entity55 at the @entity56 on april 29 has attracted former @entity58 cricket managing director @entity57 , who hardly put a foot wrong during his low - profile tenure that included three @entity62 victories , as well as @entity63 , who has n’t put a foot right since taking charge in january 2014			1
if the beleaguered @entity63 were to take any advice from @entity57 he would surely be told to do his work behind the scenes rather than at centre stage all the time			1
@entity57 ( left ) and @entity63 ( right ) will both be at the @entity55 in april the @entity46 are certainly in the right place if they were ever to be worthy of @entity72 at ten attention			1
having been evicted by the @entity0 , their new offices in @entity76 ’s @entity75 are next door to the @entity79 studio in the @entity81 building			2
and the complex production role of supplying content from all three lower league divisions in time for the 9pm @entity86 highlights show next season will be handled by @entity81			2
@entity88 , @entity89 president from june , was surrounded by rugby fans on the @entity92 concourse before the @entity94 game			1
it showed rugby definitely got one decision right — fast - tracking @entity88 to be president during the @entity2 , rather than some anonymous suit			1
and @entity58 2015 will be making the most of @entity88 being the @entity92 kingpin			2
@entity88 will take up his role as @entity89 president from june ahead of the @entity102 @entity104 ’s tweet revenge only loveable @entity105 rugby co-commentator @entity104 could go on @entity106 seemingly to embarrass his own employers			1
@entity104 said on air that @entity58 scrum - half @entity109 was his choice as official @entity105 man of the match against @entity94			0
but @entity104 then went on social media to tell followers : ‘ just to point out i picked ( @entity117 ) @entity116 as @entity118 but @entity109 came up and had to deal with it			0
’ a @entity105 spokesperson said the right graphic of @entity109 was screened and was correctly announced and that @entity104 stood by his decision			0
no he did n’t on @entity106			0
former @entity123 and @entity125 chief executive @entity124 is busy advising @entity0 promotion hopefuls @entity126 , having brought in the club ’s first foreign manager @entity127			2
he is also running global football funds with super agent @entity130			0
jersey - based @entity124 is also playing an influential role as chairman of burgeoning rugby agency @entity133			0
@entity24 have put out a banal @entity135 interview with president @entity136 answering recorded questions that would have created derision if @entity139 had done it			0
to @entity144 legend @entity143 ’ probing : ‘ mr president , i ’d like to ask if you miss playing football ? ’ @entity136 replies : ‘ @entity143 , it ’s always a pleasure to see you on tv			0
normally , when i see you , i give you a cup			0

a winter @entity2 in @entity3 in 2022 is expected to be confirmed on friday
@entity0 has been among loudest critics of a winter @entity2
@entity63 and @entity57 to attend @entity55
@entity88 to take up @entity89 president role from june
