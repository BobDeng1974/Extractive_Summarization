by @entity1 reporter published : 15:02 est , 5 november 2013 updated : 17:16 est , 5 november 2013 a newlywed and father - to - be who became paralyzed from the waist down after falling from a tree told his family to switch the life support machine off so he could die - just one day after the accident , it emerged today			1
@entity11 , 32 , from @entity12 loved the outdoors			1
he fished , camped and helped his father on his northeastern @entity12 farm , carving out time for his outdoor passions from a busy life that included a new wife , a baby on the way and a successful auto business			1
but it was in the woods , hunting for deer , where @entity11 found time to reflect on his life and faith			1
' it was just a time when he could be alone and think about things , ' said his sister , @entity30 , an intensive care nurse			0
that 's where the 32 - year - old was on saturday afternoon when those quiet moments turned tragic			2
victim : @entity11 , who fell about 16 feet from a tree and was left paralyzed from the shoulders down after a hunting accident , told his family he wanted to be taken off life support the longtime hunter fell about 16 feet from an elevated tree stand and suffered a severe spinal injury that @entity30 said left him paralyzed from the shoulders down and dependent on a ventilator to breathe			1
his brain was n't affected			1
@entity11 with his sister @entity47 who , as an intensive care nurse , meant she understood the severity of her brother 's injuries confronted with the devastating prognosis , @entity11 ' family asked doctors at @entity56 's @entity55 a hard question : could @entity11 be brought out of sedation so he could be told of his condition and decide for himself whether he wanted to live or die ? the doctors said yes			1
@entity11 - who has a step son - previously talked with his wife , @entity62 , who he married on august 3 , about never wanting to spend his life in a wheelchair , so his family knew which way it was likely to go , though it meant never seeing his unborn child			1
his sister - one of three - has seen this situation happen in her job			0
but her medical training also meant she understood the severity of her brother 's injuries			0
his @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78 vertebrae were crushed			1
though his brain was not injured , his body was irreparably broken			2
surgery could fuse the vertebrae , but that would only allow @entity11 to sit up			1
he would never walk or hold his baby			2
he might live the rest of his life in a rehabilitation hospital , relying on a machine to help him breathe			1
he 'd never return to those outdoor activities that gave him such peace			0
' we just asked him , do you want this ? and he shook his head emphatically no , ' @entity30 said			0
@entity30 said her brother — the youngest of four siblings — wanted to talk but could n't because the ventilator tube was still in place			2
she told him that if the tube was removed , they were n't sure how long he would live			2
but when she asked if he wanted the tube reinserted if he was struggling , he shook his head no. doctors asked @entity11 the same questions and got the same responses			1
the tube came out sunday			0
the last five hours of @entity11 ' life were spent with family and friends , about 75 of whom gathered in the hospital waiting room			1
they prayed and sang songs			0
courts have long upheld the right of patients to refuse life support			2
the @entity117 says competent adults can craft directives stating they want such systems withdrawn or withheld if they suffer certain injuries or illness that leave them unable to make those decisions			0
but the heart - wrenching decision to remove life support is more often left to surrogates who must speak for those patients			1
even when a patient has outlined his wishes for end - of - life care , the decision can tear families apart			1
dr @entity135 , director of the @entity136 in @entity137 , said cases in which the patient makes the decision usually involve a debilitating illness like @entity143 's disease , a condition that compromises the patient 's body but leaves the mind intact			0
through it all , @entity30 said , her brother never wavered in his decision to die			1
' i just remember him saying so many times that he loved us all and that he lived a great life , ' she said			2
' at one point he was saying , ' i 'm ready			0
'' she knows that not everyone would make the same call			0
but she 's thankful her brother was able to make his own decision			2
' no outcome was ever going to be the one that we really want , but i felt that he did it on his terms in the end , ' she said			0
medical ethicists say it 's rare for patients to decide on the spot to be removed from life support , especially so soon after an injury			0
but standard medical ethics practice is to grant more autonomy to patients , and courts have upheld their rights to decide on end - of - life care			0
often , patients change their minds after they 've had time to meet with spiritual advisers and family , said @entity185 , director of the medical ethics program at @entity188 's @entity187 in @entity189			0
dr @entity135 , director of the @entity136 in @entity137 , said cases in which the patient makes the decision usually involve a debilitating illness like @entity143 's disease , a condition that compromises the patient 's body but leaves the mind intact			0
@entity135 said patients have been legally and ethically permitted to make their own decision on life support for several decades now , due in part to court cases and the evolution of the practice of medicine , which places more emphasis on patients ' rights			1
' we give patients autonomy to make all kinds of decisions about themselves , ' he said			0
' we 've recognized that it 's important that patients have the right to self - determination			0
