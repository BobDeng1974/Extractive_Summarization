with a kaleidoscope of vivid colours , these images may look like stained glass , but they are in fact extreme close - ups of popular @entity7 drinks			1
taken through a microscope , the photographs show drops of two @entity12 aperitifs , @entity13 and @entity14 , which had been left to dry on a glass slide			1
after the alcohol and water evaporates , the remaining sugars then crystallise to produce the stunning colours			0
@entity20 , a professor of @entity21 at the @entity22 , @entity12 , took the pictures using a camera mounted on an optical microscope			1
' i put drops on glass slides and after the drinks crystallised , i placed the slides under the microscope			2
' the polarised light then passed through the crystals which enabled me to take photographs when the image was particularly appealing			0
' i wanted to capture this effect because i knew alcoholic drinks could be exciting subjects			0
after the alcohol and water evaporates , the remaining sugars then crystallise to produce the stunning colours @entity20 , a professor of @entity21 at the @entity22 , @entity12 , took the pictures using a camera mounted on an optical microscope ' i like the images because of the variety of colours and textures - after a long wait the photos are really beautiful			1
' the married father - of - two had to wait two months for the @entity14 to crystallise			1
' there are difficulties when taking these photographs			0
even though the subject is fairly ordinary , most of us have no idea of how it is made at a small scale and how the textures of materials look like under a microscope			0
' to me , as a scientist and a geologist , these images recall the way minerals crystallise in rocks , in particularly igneous and sedimentary			2
' but the first and greatest difficulty is simply to have the solution crystallise			0
' while @entity13 took a couple of days , @entity14 did n't do anything for two months			2
' the married father - of - two had to wait two months for the @entity14 to crystallise , but only a couple of days for @entity13			1
