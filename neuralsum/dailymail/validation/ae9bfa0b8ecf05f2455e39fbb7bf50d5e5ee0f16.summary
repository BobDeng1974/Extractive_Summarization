a @entity1 candidate had to be rescued from high tides at the party 's annual spring conference after writing a note on the beach proclaiming his love for leader @entity8			1
@entity9 , 31 , the party 's @entity10 candidate , was pictured being hauled out of the water onto a breakwater by press officer @entity14 when he became trapped after jumping a wall to scrawl the doting message in the sand			1
the debacle began after he hastily jumped down onto the beach early saturday morning to write a response to protesters			2
after jumping down onto the sand to write the message , @entity1 candidate @entity9 realised he was trapped by the tide press officer @entity14 ( right ) then intervened to help pull him up a seaweed - covered breakwater with mr @entity14 's help , he managed to avoid getting wet - although the press officer said lifting him ' was n't the easiest ' mr @entity9 poses beside his message in the sand at @entity29 which reads ' we love @entity31 ' the message was written on the beach on saturday at @entity29 during the party 's annual spring conference			1
mr @entity14 told @entity36 that mr @entity9 - ' the enterprising chap that he is ' - decided to scrawl the message in the sand in response to messages left on the beach by protesters the previous day			1
' basically it was about 7.30 in the morning and the previous day some @entity46 activists had scribbled some rude stuff in the beach			1
@entity50 leader @entity8 was said to be amused when he saw the message and heard about his candidate 's struggle to get off the beach ' i knew nothing of this and i was pottering around the conference hall and i saw the snappers take off looking purposeful			2
' following the commotion , he stumbled across mr @entity9 hurriedly scrawling the message in the sand			2
but it was after he finished writing the note and proudly posing for photographs that he found himself in trouble			2
mr @entity14 added : ' basically , he 'd gone down and did n't realise there was no exit because the tide was too far in , so i helped him out			0
' it was actually quite hard because that whole breakwater that i pulled him up from - top to bottom - was covered in seaweed			0
it was n't the easiest yank i 've done			0
' however , he did say party leader @entity8 managed to see the amusing side of the debacle			0
' he just smiled at it			0
he was n't there at the time , he arrived a bit later and he saw the scribble on the beach and just laughed			0
' mr @entity9 told @entity84 : ' i jumped the wall - it was about six to seven feet high - and wrote a message myself in the sand , which said " we love @entity1 " and then " @entity90 "			1
' ' there were no stairs so i got stuck , hence the photo which is quite amazing			0

@entity1 candidate @entity9 , 31 , wrote ' we love @entity31 ' in the sand at @entity29
he scrawled it in response to messages left by protesters the previous day
but he *misjudged* tides and found himself trapped after posing for photos
party press officer had to intervene and help pull him up onto breakwater
