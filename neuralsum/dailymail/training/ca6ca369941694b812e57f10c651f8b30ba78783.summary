by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:35 est , 6 november 2012 updated : 04:40 est , 7 november 2012 investigation : home secretary @entity3 has announced a new investigation into child abuse in @entity6 in the 70s and 80s a single wide - ranging judicial inquiry into ‘ absolutely horrific ’ evidence of systematic child abuse by figures of authority over several decades looked increasingly likely last night			1
there were growing cross-party calls for an over-arching investigation as the number of separate probes into allegations of paedophilia at the @entity20 , care homes and in @entity22 reached double figures			2
home secretary @entity3 told @entity24 that the @entity25 ( @entity25 ) is to mount an investigation into alleged abuse in @entity6 in the 1970s and 1980s amid claims that a senior @entity29 of the day was among the perpetrators			1
but she suggested that a single , wider probe was being considered by the government once initial police inquiries are concluded			1
‘ i think what is absolutely horrific , frankly , is the extent to which this child abuse has been taking place over the years and across our communities over the years , ’ the home secretary said			1
@entity40 , speaking on a trip to the @entity42 , also opened the door to a broader judicial inquiry into the tide of historic child sex abuse allegations which began with revelations about @entity49 ’s paedophile activities at the @entity20			1
‘ let ’s find out as quickly as possible whether we have a problem here			0
if we have a problem here then we have to take further steps , ’ the prime minister said			0
‘ i do n’t rule out further inquiries , further investigations , further ways of learning lessons because clearly we ’ve discovered some appalling things in recent days , particularly on the @entity49 front			0
’ on top of the @entity67 scandal – which has dragged in the @entity68 and the police – there are increasingly wild allegations of an establishment paedophile ring involving members of the @entity74 government			1
@entity25 director general @entity75 will review the original police handling of complaints of a paedophile ring abusing children in care homes in @entity6 , and examine the latest claims by an alleged victim			1
separately , high court judge mrs justice @entity83 is to lead a review of the @entity86 , an inquiry set up by the then welsh secretary @entity87 , into allegations of child abuse at @entity6 care homes			1
‘ child abuse is a hateful , abhorrent and disgusting crime and we must not allow these allegations to go unanswered			2
’ former conservative children ’s minister @entity104 said the prime minister had acted ‘ commendably swiftly ’ but there were now so many inquiries into child abuse , there was a serious danger of not being able to see ‘ the wood for the trees ’			2
he called for one , over-arching investigation , adding : ‘ this is just getting going , this is the tip of the iceberg , this is going to get bigger and it ’s going to go into other areas			2
‘ we ’re getting an inquiry a week			0
there are now victims out there whose voices are only beginning to be heard			0
' i think we have just got to have one over-arching , robust inquiry led by a high - level figure			0
’ @entity130 ’s deputy chairman @entity129 , who last month claimed there was ‘ clear intelligence ’ suggesting a historic paedophile ring may be linked to @entity134 , criticised the government ’s response			0
he said : ‘ the lesson of @entity138 and hacking is that a narrowed - down investigation is the basic building block of a cover - up			0
‘ to limit this inquiry to @entity6 and @entity145 would , in my view , be a dereliction of the home secretary ’s duty			1
’ in a direct attack on mrs may , which drew cries of protest from the conservative benches , he asked : ‘ does she sincerely want to start making amends or can she live with being what she has just announced : the next stage of a cover - up			0
’ n the child protection system in @entity162 is failing vulnerable teenagers and is in urgent need of review , mps warn today			0
the @entity166 said that while local authorities had a duty to safeguard all children up to the age of 18 , too often the needs of older youngsters were not met			0
it said its inquiry uncovered a ‘ worrying picture ’ of the protection and support available to children aged 14 to 18			2
in charge : @entity25 boss @entity75 , pictured being decorated with the @entity179 in 2008 , is to review historic allegations of child abuse at @entity6 care homes			1
