a woman with a rare genetic condition is so allergic to protein that eating burger and chips could leave her brain damaged			2
@entity6 , 36 , suffers from phenylketonuria which means a build - up of protein could leave her with devastating brain and muscle damage			1
she has never eaten meat and receives most of her food on prescription from her gp			1
rare condition : @entity6 , 36 , suffers from phenylketonuria which means build - up of protein could leave her with devastating brain and muscle damage and as potatoes and bread count towards her daily protein intake , chips and buns are a no go as well			1
ms @entity6 , from @entity27 , @entity28 , said : ' a burger is always out of the question , and just going to @entity31 's is a big no no because i ca n't eat anything			1
' even though it 's a bit weird picking up my weekly shop from the doctors i know i 'm safer this way ! ' after being diagnosed at just a few days old , phd student ms @entity6 has kept to a strict vegan diet			2
@entity41 ( @entity41 ) means her body can not break down one of the amino acids found in protein : phenylalaine			1
strict diet : she has never eaten meat and receives most of her food on prescription from her gp too much gives her chronic migraines and aching muscles so ms @entity6 has to limit herself to just 10g of protein a day			1
@entity41 ( @entity41 ) is a rare genetic condition that 's present from birth			2
the body is unable to break down a substance called phenylalanine , which builds up in the blood and brain			2
high levels of phenylalanine can damage the brain			0
@entity41 is treated with a special low - protein diet , which reduces the levels of phenylalanine in the body and prevents brain damage			1
the condition does n't usually cause any symptoms if treatment is started early			0
if @entity41 is n't treated , damage to the brain and nervous system can lead to learning difficulties , behavioural difficulties and epilepsy			0
source : @entity77 and if she continued to snack on meat , dairy or nuts , or even bread and pasta which also contain the offending amino acid , she would face developing epilepsy , brain damage , and severe muscle problems			0
instead she must eat specialist pasta and bread which has had the phenylalaine removed and take a cocktail of supplements every day to keep her healthy			0
she says eating out is a nightmare and claims she was even bullied as a child for her unsual diet			0
but she knows it 's a small price to pay for avoiding the horrific dangers of too much protein			0
she added : ' it was really hard growing up - i was bullied by other kids at school because my packed lunch always looked a bit funny			1
' when i went to birthday parties i took my own little bag of food instead of leaving with a piece of cake ! ' even though i went through a rebellious phase and bought chocolate after school with my pocket money i had to stop because it made me so tired and achy			0
' i can only have 10 grams of protein a day - it 's the equivalent of five bags of crisps - so i have to weigh absolutely everything			0
ms @entity6 , pictured with the with fast food that could give her brain damage and the food prescribed to her by the doctors ' for the last six years or so i 've been supported by a dietician at the @entity124 in @entity125 which has been incredible			2
' before that my diet was n't quite right and i had horrific headaches			0
' @entity41 is very rare - it affects one in every 10,000 babies born - so i 'm lucky they caught it when i was young - even if it means missing out on a takeaway and chocolate ! '			1
