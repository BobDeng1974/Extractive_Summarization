a woman who sued her university last year for restricting where she could take her guinea pig has now settled the case for $ 40,000			2
@entity5 first petitioned @entity7 officials to allow her to keep her guinea pig for ‘ emotional support ’ in 2011			1
@entity5 suffers from severe depression and also depends on the use of a pacemaker			0
not a pet : ' severely depressed ' @entity5 sued her university last year for banning her ' emotional support ' guinea pig ( pictured ) eventually , school officials allowed @entity5 to keep in her pet - free dormitory what she says was an animal prescribed to help her with her disabling conditions			1
however , @entity5 and her lawyers say the approval came with stipulations about where on campus @entity5 could take the animal			0
for instance , the 28 - year - old could not take the guinea pig to class or to where food was served			1
for these restrictions , @entity5 sued the school for failing to provide reasonable accommodations for her disabilities under federal housing laws			1
not fair : court filings dropped last month alleged @entity7 broke federal fair housing laws @entity5 and @entity7 have now reached a settlement and @entity5 will receive $ 40,000 , according to @entity38			2
‘ the parties ’ decision to enter into this agreement , ’ reads the settlement , ‘ represents a compromise of disputed claims and creates the framework for the parties to move forward without the disruption and cost of litigation			0
’ meanwhile , the university maintains it never ‘ acted wrongly or failed to act in any way with regard to @entity5			0
’ the case spoke to discrepancies in definition between ‘ therapy animals ’ and ‘ service animals			0
’ half sorry : now @entity7 ( pictured ) will pay @entity5 a $ 40,000 settlement but maintains it followed all the rules in dealing with the student moving forward , @entity7 says it will work with the @entity61 of @entity62 to fill in those gaps and address assistance animals such as @entity5 ’s in school policy			2
the school also said it will address the issue differently if @entity5 ever chooses to reapply to campus housing			0
' should @entity5 ever reapply for on - campus housing and make an accommodation request to live with a guinea pig or animal of similar size and nature , @entity7 will grant said request			1

@entity5 was told she could have her ' emotional support ' guinea pig in her pet - free dorm , but that was *n't* enough
the 28 - year - old sued @entity7 for what she said was a *violation* of federal housing laws
