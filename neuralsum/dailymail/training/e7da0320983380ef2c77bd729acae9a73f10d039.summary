by @entity0 they may look like the spindly mechanical robots from @entity3 , but these sculptures are much less menacing			0
the conceptual structures are designed as a way of ‘ reclaiming ’ @entity8 ’s shoreline for locals who could use them to harvest electricity and as ‘ look outs ’			1
designed to look like an eye , the ‘ @entity14 ’ sculptures would open and shut like an eye to provide shelter and would be connected to a buoy in the sea to harvest electricity , if they are ever built			1
friendlier than aliens : the conceptual structures might look like aliens are designed as a way of ' reclaiming ' @entity8 's shoreline for locals who could use them to harvest electricity and as ' look outs ' in the mock - up images , a view of the sea is framed by a pair of metal and wooden eyelids that open and close with the motion of the waves			1
in this way , the sculpture would blink with the rhythm of the sea			0
the concepts were designed by @entity42 , which has an office in the @entity45 capital			0
the architects said that the sculptures connect ‘ the dense city and the open sea ’ and that ‘ waves transform the kinematic structure into an experience of place and to harvest energy for the fishermen community ’			2
separated at birth ? the three - legged spindly sculptures look a little similar to the martians in @entity3 ( pictured ) , which was most recently the subject of a film starring @entity61 in 2005 keeping an eye out : a view of the sea would be framed by a pair of metal and wooden eyelids , which open and close with the motion of the waves ( illustrated ) if the concepts are built standing guard : the architects said that the sculptures connect ' the dense city and the open sea ' and that ' waves transform the kinematic structure into an experience of place and to harvest energy for the fishermen community ' an offshore buoy with an electric generator attached via an ‘ extended antenna ’ would play a role in allowing the sculptures to harvest tidal power , but it is not known how much electricity the structures could generate			1
the @entity8 district , which could one day house the unusual sculptures , has become increasingly built up with luxury developments			2
‘ @entity14 is an attempt at resisting the expropriation of @entity8 's open coastline returning the sea back to the fishermen and the local habitants of the @entity8 district , ’ they told @entity93			2
@entity100 : an offshore buoy with an electric generator attached via an ' extended antenna ' would play a role in allowing the sculptures to harvest tidal power , but it is not known how much electricity the structures ( illustrated ) could generate animated : the sculptures would blink with the rhythm of the sea and provide shelter for people wanting to watch the water ( pictured ) home sweet home : the @entity8 district , where it is planned the sculptures will be situated ( illustrated ) has become increasingly built up with luxury developments it is envisaged that the three - legged moving structures would become a chain of elevated lookouts for fishermen or anyone who wants to look out to sea			1
models of a 5:1 scale have already been tested on the desirable coastline to allow the architects to create realistic images of how the sculptures might look one day			0
the architects said : ‘ the principal aim of @entity14 is to reclaim accessibility to the sea			0
for centuries , the local population of @entity136 and @entity137 lived in tune with their costal environment , but over the past decade the shoreline has become a playground for high - end residential developments that aim to turn a maximum profit by selling off unobstructed views to the sea			0
‘ the dweller can experience the place , the passage of time and its natural forces			0
’ the @entity8 district ( mapped ) which could one day house the unusual sculptures , has become increasingly built up with luxury developments an eye on the water : it is envisaged that the three - legged moving structures would become a chain of elevated lookouts for fishermen or anyone who wants to look out to sea ( illustrated ) models of a 5:1 scale have already been tested on the desirable coastline to allow the architects to create realistic images ( pictured ) of how the sculptures might look one day			1

conceptual structures are designed as a way of ‘ reclaiming ’ @entity8 ’s shoreline for locals , which has become a luxury property *hotspot*
@entity14 sculptures will ' blink ' in time with the waves and provide shelter for fishermen watching the water , if they are ever built
they would be attached to a buoy with a *tethered* generator to provide power for local homes - although how *effective* they might be is a *mystery*
