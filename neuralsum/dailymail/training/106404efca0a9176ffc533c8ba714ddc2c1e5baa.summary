' it went off just after 2pm , and about 45 minutes later we were evacuated as we were told we were in a safe area			2
' mr @entity48 , from @entity63 , @entity64 , said : ' we were told nothing about what was actually happening but there was armed police at the front doors from what we could see			0

emergency services attend the scene following the discovery of a suspicious package at @entity3 security personnel at @entity3 put a 100 - metre cordon was put in place around the package inbound planes were diverted to @entity45 as the incident was dealt with while outbound flights were cancelled passengers wait for news at @entity3 after it was evacuated tonight police concluded there was no threat and efforts were being made to return the airport to normal ' unfortunately that meant as part of that we had to evacuate the terminal building so it 's effectively been closed since about 2.15pm and we 've not been able to operate as normal , clearly in that time there has been a very extensive investigation with police and authorities and i 'm delighted to say that they 've now concluded that there is no threat , obviously it has taken some time to do that , so the challenge now will be once they have handed back the site to us that we get the airport back up to full operation			1
' we 'll do that relatively quickly but inevitably passengers and aircraft may not be where we need them and it will be a number of hours yet before we can get to some normality			0
' we now this causes huge disruption and upset to people , we have done our best to mitigate that and make people as comfortable as possible in the circumstances but it 's a cold wet day in @entity3 , there 's limited facilities when the terminal is shut and we just want to make sure people can now get away on their travels as best as possible			0
' all we can do now is keep people informed , try to help the airlines get back to normality and get as many people away on their journey as possible			0
