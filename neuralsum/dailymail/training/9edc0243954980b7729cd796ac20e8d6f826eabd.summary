turns out getting rid of @entity0 has done nothing to lift the gloom at @entity3			1
the @entity4 might have been a convenient scapegoat for disaffection in the @entity7 but saturday ’s display in the @entity9 was wearisomely familiar			2
and at the end of a turgid performance , there were extraordinary scenes as the @entity3 players went to applaud their own fans and were greeted by a chorus of boos and chants of ‘ we ’re s * * * and we ’re sick of it ! ’ video : scroll down for @entity23 's @entity22 : @entity24 1 - 0 @entity3 @entity25 celebrates after giving @entity24 the lead during the @entity9 third round clash with @entity3 on saturday @entity29 goalkeeper @entity28 is hopeless to stop the first goal of the game at the @entity32 @entity25 is congratulated by his team - mates as the @entity34 advanced to the fourth round of the @entity9 @entity3 players look dejected after the final whistle as @entity38 applauds the travelling fans @entity24 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity40 6 ; @entity41 6.5 , @entity42 7 , @entity43 6 , @entity44 6 ; @entity45 , 6.5 @entity46 5.5 ( @entity47 26 - 7 ) , @entity48 6.5 ; @entity49 , 6 , ( @entity50 73 - 7 ) ; @entity25 6.5 ( @entity51 59 – 6.5 ) subs : @entity50 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 @entity57 7 goal : @entity25 39 @entity3 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity28 7 ; @entity59 5 ( @entity60 59 5.5 ) , @entity61 6 , @entity62 6 , @entity63 5,5 ; @entity64 , 6.5 @entity65 6 , @entity66 5.5 ( @entity67 , 79 - 6 ) ; @entity68 6.5 , @entity69 , 6 @entity70 6.5			1
subs : @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 @entity77 5 ref : @entity78 6 some fans did applaud but the majority appeared to be booing and gesturing for the players to leave			1
the players themselves looked bemused , unsure of what to do in the face of such hostility , before eventually departing			2
truly this is a club in the midst of an identity crisis			2
‘ it ’s hugely embarrassing but they ’re entitled to do that , ’ said stand - in coach @entity77			1
‘ the one thing i was n’t going to allow was that the players did n’t go over to them			2
i was in front of everybody because we deserved it			0
that ’s how they feel , they pay their money their entitled to do that			0
’ @entity77 , a @entity3 man to his core , knows better than most why there is so much dissatisfaction			1
once this club boasted a proud @entity9 tradition — they have been finalists 13 times and have won it on six of those occasions			0
they have now won three @entity9 ties in nine years and on saturday they played like a team whose board of directors have belittled cup competitions as being of minimal financial use			0
@entity77 had invoked the spirit of sir @entity123 before the game and had expressed his desire to take the @entity9 seriously with a strong team — but in the cold light of day , and with injuries mounting , pragmatism trumps romanticism			1
@entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 and @entity134 were all carrying niggling injuries and deemed too important to risk , while @entity136 was deemed too exhausted to start			0
‘ the future of this football club is over the next few weeks and it was important we got people fully fit for our next game , ’ said @entity77			1
‘ i put out the strongest team that i could , other than @entity136 , who ’s come from a new culture and been one of our shining lights in a season and he ’s run out of fuel , there ’s nothing left in the tank			2
for me to play him with @entity153 being in the @entity154 , would have been a massive , massive gamble			0
’ @entity24 also made seven changes — small wonder with 48 hours in between fixtures — but they at least attacked the game with an intent which belied their precarious @entity162 status			1
@entity3 fans shout abuse at their team at the end of the @entity168 match @entity77 is yet to win as coach after @entity0 's departure to @entity171 this week @entity49 squares up to @entity3 's @entity63 during a heated opening at the @entity32 @entity173 thought he had given the visitors the lead but the linesman flagged for offisde @entity40 was certainly beaten by @entity173 's strike and was grateful for the offside flag the attendance was well down at the @entity32 in the all - @entity162 clash @entity47 crosses the ball past the onrushing @entity65 from the right - hand side ultimately , @entity77 , who wants the job , will be judged on his @entity162 record			1
but saturday ’s performance did not bode well			0
they did at least produce the finest moment of the first half on 32 minutes — only to see their efforts ruled out by an offside flag			2
@entity38 broke down the right , crossed and saw @entity69 deliver a superb flick to @entity173 , who finished beautifully but was ruled offside			1
‘ we ’ve gone out with a whimper because of a poor decision in the first half			0
i thought at the time it was a good goal , there was a delay with the linesman making the decision			2
@entity57 said to me it was a good goal and it was onside but that ’s no comfort because we ’ve come away from home , brought a fantastic following and lost the game , which is not good enough			0
’ @entity24 , though , had showed more desire throughout			1
‘ there ’s no doubt the @entity162 is our priority but it was always going to be important to get the right result here rather than the performance , ’ said @entity57			0
‘ today ’s game was an illustration of two clubs needing to utilise the squad , so it did n’t make for the best game but we put in a very committed performance			0
and that ’s important as january and february are going to be very big months for us			0
’ by then , @entity57 hopes he will have fomer @entity223 striker @entity222 in his ranks			0
the 32 - year - old has spent a year in @entity226 with @entity227 but is keen on a return to the @entity162 and the @entity34 are leading the chase for his signature			2
@entity3 's stand - in boss @entity77 reacts from the touchline during the game @entity48 of @entity24 goes into the tackle with @entity68 and @entity65 @entity63 gets down the wing from left back but is well tracked by opposing defender @entity236 of @entity24 current hot shot @entity25 had missed a fine chance on 11 minutes from a @entity48 corner , shooting over when unmarked ; and @entity49 flashed a shot across goal on 30 minutes			1
the breakthrough for @entity24 finally came on 39 minutes , a short corner being played to @entity244 whose rifled shot was flicked on by @entity25 and went in off the crossbar			1
it was no more than they deserved and in the second half , without ever setting the game alight , they consistently created the better chances			0
@entity3 ’s @entity28 had to react sharply to keep out a diving header from substitute @entity51 before @entity50 raced away on 76 minutes and drove in a shot the keeper pushed away			1
as for @entity3 , 17 - year - old academy graduate @entity68 impressed in parts and registered a shot on goal early in the second half			1
and @entity66 had a free kick deflected , which almost fooled @entity40			0
other than that , there really was precious little else to cheer			0
@entity43 tracks @entity3 striker @entity69 during the third round fixture @entity38 looks to keep up with @entity48 as the @entity24 midfielder travels forward with the ball @entity24 boss @entity57 and his backroom staff and substitutes watch on from the sideline			1

@entity25 scores in 39th minute as @entity24 advance to the @entity270 at @entity3 's *expense*
@entity3 's stand - in boss for @entity77 rested several players at the @entity275
@entity0 left to take on role at @entity171 this week
@entity173 thought he had given visitors the lead but his effort was *disallowed* for offside
