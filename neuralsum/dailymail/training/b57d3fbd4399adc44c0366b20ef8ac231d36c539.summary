@entity8 , 50 , suffers with an undiagnosable condition that causes her muscles to spasm , stiffen and swell			1
she has deteriorated in recent months , with chest pain causing her worry that that condition may kill her if she does not receive appropriate treatment soon she has already started to develop chest pains when she suffers a flare - up and she is worried that she will be left unable to breathe or have a heart attack			1
ms @entity8 is the subject of a @entity28 documentary which follows her journey to get a definitive diagnosis			1
until she is formally diagnosed , doctors are unable to treat the root cause of her frightening condition			0
for years doctors believed she suffered with a very rare condition called @entity36 , but tests have been unable to confirm this			1
agony : in the @entity28 documentary , ms @entity8 undergoes rigorous testing			1
doctors originally believed she has @entity36 , but test results have all come back negative last year ms @entity44 's spasms caused her muscles to build up and swell so much that she put on five stone and her neck swelled by four inches			1
she said that one of the things she hates the most about the condition is the lack of control she has over her life but recently a more sensitive test , which can pick up even trace amounts of the the antibodies responsible for the condition , has become available			2
in the documentary , ms @entity8 visits consultants at the @entity60 in @entity61 as well experts at the @entity63 in @entity64 to undergo eight days of rigorous testing			1
last year ms @entity44 's spasms caused her muscles to build up and swell so much that she put on five stone and her neck swelled by four inches			2
before developing the mystery condition , ms @entity8 had a succesful career as a social worker and was a busy mother - of - three			1
since 1999 however she has deteriorated and for the past seven years she has been confined to a padded bed to ensure she does not hurt herself when she suffers the debilitating muscle spasms the mystery condition can flare up at any moment and an episode can last anything from a few minutes to over an hour			2
she said : ' when i have a bad attack i swell up like the @entity6			2
i look enormous and i even call myself the @entity6 , @entity78 ( @entity78 ) or @entity79			0
i ’m like a bodybuilder			0
' although it has never been proven , ms @entity8 blames a car accident in 1999 for the development of her condition			2
within a short space of time , the paralysing shudders left her unable to wash , eat or bathe without help and for the past seven years she has been confined to a darkened room			0
an episode of the muscle stiffening can occur at any time			0
ms @entity8 says that stress , loud noises and even certain foods can trigger an attack			0
for many years people simply believed she was a hypochondriac she said : ‘ everyday i wake up to the same thing			0
it 's like being in a coffin			0
anything can trigger me to become stiff – the cold and stress are the big ones			0
' ms @entity8 said that many people simply believed that she was a hypochondriac when she first sought medical help			0
but in 2004 , specialists diagnosed her with @entity36 and have since managed her symptoms with tranquilisers			2
ms @entity8 likens her symptoms to those of the @entity6 in the documentary her consultant explained that most people require just 10mg of diazepam to make them relaxed enough to undergo an uncomfortable procedure such as an endoscopy , but that ms @entity8 is on 30mg , four times a day			1
this , he said , is enough to knock out 12 people			0
ms @entity8 said : ' my muscles tear at the same time and they increase in mass meaning my weight balloons			0
' if i do n’t get an injection of diazepam quickly enough my whole body stiffens , leaving me unable to have any treatment because a needle will just snap			0
two weeks after undergoing testing , ms @entity8 receives her results and the documentary finally reveals whether or not ms @entity8 suffers with @entity36			1
they say that even if they are not able to confirm what is wrong with her , the results will be helpful because it means that they can investigate other causes of the condition and try out other treatments .			0

but this has never been confirmed and she needs a formal diagnosis to undergo risky but life - *changing* treatment for condition
documentary follows her quest to get answers about *strange* symptoms
