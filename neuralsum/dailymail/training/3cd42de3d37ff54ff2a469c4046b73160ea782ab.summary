by @entity0 medical bills for @entity3 holidaymakers who fall ill abroad have almost doubled in the last decade with average claims costing over £ 900			1
but six million @entity3 are still failing to take out travel insurance before they head off on their holiday			1
despite fears of theft , lost luggage and missed flights , research shows that illness and injury are the most common reasons for a travel insurance claim for holidaymakers			1
health problems : illness and injury are the biggest causes of claims among @entity3 travellers on holiday the figures also show that the countries where the most claims happen are @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 , while the highest bills for medical treatment occur in the @entity31 and @entity32			1
@entity33 ( stomach bugs ) 2			0
injuries to knee and lower leg3			0
skin problems ( dermatitis , allergic reaction ) 8			0
injuries to the wrist and hand9			0
back pain and pelvic injuries10			0
animal or insect bite and while many associate high medical bills with serious health problems , it is actually everyday illnesses that can cause the biggest problems , with unexpectedly high bills for treatment			2
an analysis of claims in the last 12 months by @entity62 travel insurance shows that bills have almost doubled over the last decade			1
an average medical claim now costs over £ 900 , rising to just under £ 1,000 for travellers aged 65 and older , but can shoot up if a hospital stay is necessary			1
the average non-medical travel insurance claim is less than half of that , at just over £ 400			1
the highest medical pay out over the last year was for over £ 1.5 million			1
this was for a woman who received treatment after suffering a brain injury in @entity75 and was flown home by air ambulance			0
necessity : six million @entity3 are travelling abroad without insurance , despite the average cost of medical claims doubling to more than £ 900 but , surprisingly , the study revealed that the top medical condition for generating claims proved to be @entity33 - which is a stomach bug			1
while many would dismiss this as a 24 hour inconvenience , it can lead to dehydration and hospitalisation			0
one holidaymaker who fell ill in @entity31 would have faced a whopping £ 100,000 debt after treatment had they not taken out insurance			2
the second most common problem was injuries to knees and lower legs , followed by head injuries			0
@entity103 ear infections were also prevalent , along with heart conditions and allergic reactions , back pain , animal and insect bites			0
all the apparently minor ailments could prove costly abroad with an overnight hospital stay in @entity26 following an allergic reaction resulting in a £ 3,000 bill and treatment for a broken leg in @entity31 costing as much as £ 40,000			0
despite rising medical fees around one in four holidaymakers ( 24 per cent ) , roughly six million a year , still take the gamble of travelling uninsured , according to the @entity132			2
@entity133 of @entity134 , @entity135 , said : ' despite the risks , many holidaymakers still consider travel insurance to be a luxury ; this really is one area where it is not worth trying to cut financial corners			2
medical treatment abroad , for even the less serious illnesses , can result in very large bills			0
' figures from the @entity147 reveal that travel insurers come to the aid of 4,600 people a week needing emergency medical treatment while abroad , at a cost of £ 4 million a week			2
the latest industry reports also show that medical costs represented 56 per cent of travel insurance claims in 2012 , with the costs relative to claims rising sharply .			1
