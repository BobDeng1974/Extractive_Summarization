if @entity1 beat @entity2 on tuesday , it could be worth as much as £ 250,000 to the club			1
but playing @entity4 would be about far more than money			1
they ’re a lovely bunch of lads – just imagine how they ’ll feel if @entity9 decide to switch the game to @entity11 and they ’re walking out at the @entity11 on january 4 ! stop me if i ’ve mentioned this before , but i ’m a non-executive director at @entity1 , and i can tell you they ’ve got a smashing set - up there			1
@entity1 players celebrate @entity20 's decisive goal against @entity21 in october @entity22 celebrates scoring for @entity1 in the same match earlier this season @entity1 could face a trip to @entity11 if they make it through to the next round of the @entity27 the chief executive , @entity28 , works for nowt			1
our chairman , @entity30 , keeps a tight rein on things , and we ’re solvent – just about			2
our manager and his @entity35 – @entity36 and @entity37 – are a couple of scousers who know @entity9 through and through			2
my own association with the club goes back a long way			1
unfortunately i was born a year after their only previous game against @entity4 – we drew 2 - 2 with them in the 1946 @entity27 , then lost the replay 5 - 1			1
we ’ve had a few years to mull that one over … but i went to school – like everyone else in my family – at @entity51 , which was right next door to where @entity9 used to play until they were dissolved in 1963			0
@entity55 says for @entity1 to have people like @entity37 involved at the club is invaluable @entity36 will be delighted if his side can set up a @entity27 third round clash with @entity4 @entity1 players could be celebrating like this again if they overcome @entity2 in their @entity27 replay i grew up with them in my bones			1
in the 1950s , their manager was a @entity66 called @entity67			0
virtually the whole team were @entity69 , and they used to stay in a local guesthouse , where my @entity71 was the housekeeper			0
i used to wander in and out as i pleased			0
you may not know this , but i also played for the youth side after they went down to the @entity75			1
i was an inside - left – fancied myself as a bit of a @entity77			2
not everyone saw it that way , though , and i was transferred to @entity81 , for – as the local paper put it – “ an undisclosed sum ”			0
suffice to say i did n’t make my fortune , so i carried on playing cricket			0
i wish i could be cheering the lads on , but i ’ll be on an @entity89 flight out of @entity90 after @entity91 ’s seventh and final one - day international here in @entity93			2
perhaps the pilot will let us have the score			0
all i ’ll say is that the players wo n’t need more motivation than to be reminded of the first three words of our team song , ‘ on @entity102 , on … ’			0

@entity1 could face a trip to @entity4 in the @entity27 third round if they beat @entity2 on tuesday
the club could earn as much as £ 250,000 if they advance through
however , the *prospect* of facing the @entity110 means so much more
@entity1 last played @entity4 in the 1946 @entity27 - losing the replay 5 - 1 after drawing the *initial* game 2 - 2
club *deserve* all the *success* that comes to them
