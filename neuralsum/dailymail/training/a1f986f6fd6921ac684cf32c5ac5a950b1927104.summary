by @entity0 published : 10:16 est , 4 november 2013 updated : 15:09 est , 5 november 2013 health officials today denied that a flesh - eating heroin alternative drug had spread to @entity3			1
they said that three suspected cases of krokodil were not confirmed to be the lethal drug and that the most prominently reported case , in @entity7 , was likely an infection from using dirty needles			1
surprisingly , a spokesperson for the @entity12 told @entity13 the lack of krokodil usage in @entity3 may come from heroin being so readily available			1
flesh eating : there had been fears that flesh eating drug @entity21 was being used in @entity3			1
@entity23 , 29 a drug addict , in @entity24 , @entity22 shows her wound from the drug all three suspected @entity3 cases , initially suspected to be the cannibal narcotic were something else entirely			1
' it is my understanding that everything that ’s been tested for has been negative , ' the spokesperson said			2
testing for the drug failed to find codeine , the key ingredient that makes the krokodil authentic , the spokesperson explained			1
initial assumptions that people were taking the drug may have been rooted in skin conditions found on drug users			1
' there ’s a skin reaction associated with krokodil , causing some people to jump to the conclusion , ' said the spokesperson			1
' it ’s turning out to be other types of skin reactions from using dirty needles , ' the spokesperson added			0
all three cases were likely simple infections from sharing needles with others			1
already suspected to be in @entity59 , @entity22 and @entity60 , the lethal opiate gets its name from the greenish - black color and scaly appearance given to the skin of users – similar to a crocodile			2
the spokesperson further added that one of the two @entity59 cases did not test positive for the toxic drug			1
local officials immediately suspected the @entity7 man had taken krokdil after he admitted to using the drug , and because of lesions on his skin			1
‘ the patient had a large , open wound and it is consistent with what we 've been seeing , or the trend when people use [ krokodil ]			1
’ @entity87 deputy chief @entity86 told @entity88			0
a call by @entity13 to the @entity90 of @entity91 was not answered			0
' it seems like a stretch in this case , ' dr @entity92 , of the @entity12 told @entity13			0
' but injection drug users will do a lot of things before calling [ for help ]			2
' the lack of evidence supporting the usage of krokodil in @entity3 is also being attributed by poison control officials to a surprising , and perhaps unexpected , factor			1
heroin is easier to get : one @entity3 official claims readily available heroin , similar to that pictured here , keeps krokodil off the state 's streets ' we ’re guessing totally that it ’s not an issue here is because sadly its much easier for people to get a hold of heroin here , ' the spokesperson said			1
' we have a major problem with heroin being extremely available , ' dr @entity92 added , explaining that @entity3 is a hotbed for drug users			1
' there ’s still a very plentiful supply of all sorts of opiates available , ' dr @entity92 said , adding ' i do n’t expect that [ krokodil is ] going to be a big problem here			2
' given the lack of readily available codeine , which is the key ingredient in @entity21 , the drug is harder to make			2
in @entity136 , the spokesperson further explained , people have a much easier time finding codeine than they do heroin , both the doctor and the spokesperson noted			2
people in @entity3 who want heroin get heroin , many in @entity136 who want heroin settle for krokodil - and its devastating side effects			1
even though there is no evidence to suggest the deadly drug has found its way into @entity3 , dr @entity92 cautioned that it does n't mean people in the state are n't using it - but reiterated that he does n't ever see it reaching the scale of epidemic currently seen in @entity136			1
despite the lack of concern by officials , the deadly drug ’s presence has been detected in multiple @entity164 states , and horrific images of the ravaged bodies of addicts are becoming commonplace			0
at least one user , in @entity60 , has died from using krokodil , others have suffered permanent damage from the drug – which literally eats the flesh of users from the inside - out			2
another user , in @entity22 , told @entity13 of the horrors krokodil has inflicted on her			0
wounds : @entity181 causes terrible weeping sores and its use has been spreading across @entity164 ‘ it did n't take long before we both started to get these horrible deep sores on our bodies , particularly our arms and legs , ’ former addict @entity185 said			0
the woman suffered ‘ deep holes and the skin is just rotting away , it 's hard to describe how revolting they are , ' she said			0
despite having spent $ 100 on her last stash of the vile narcotic , ms @entity23 threw it away – a cardinal sin to an addict – when she discovered what it was			0
a doctor who treated ms @entity23 and her sister told @entity13 the drug ’s use is widespread and pleaded with authorities to address it			0
‘ the effects are the worst i have ever seen from any drug in all my years of practice … i really do n't know how it can be stopped , but it has to start with law enforcement			0
’ the @entity215 , for its part , has mostly downplayed the drug ’s danger to communities			0
’ none of our forensic labs have analysed samples that became krokodil , ' @entity215 spokesperson @entity219 told @entity13			0
ms @entity225 told @entity13 she has been using the drug for over a year , and that its use is common			0
@entity24 , where ms @entity23 is from , is close to @entity228 - notably because mr @entity219 said the @entity228 field office of the @entity215 recently received a sample of a drug believed to be krokodil			1
testing revealed it to be heroin , said mr @entity219			0
' often times we get a sample of a chemical or substance , and its given to us believed to be one thing that turns out to be something else , ' said mr @entity219			0
' this is what is happening , things are believed to be one thing , and it turns out to be other substances , ' he added			0
mr @entity219 also explained that dealers do n't always know what they are selling , leading them to call something krokodil because that is the hot name , but have it be another synthetic drug			2
@entity21 , also known as desomorphine , is similar to heroin , but more powerful than morphine			0
the high is immediate , intense and cheap - but only lasts a few hours			0
unlike heroin , which some people use for several years , krokodil is known to kill the majority of those addicted in only a couple of years .			2

three people were suspected in @entity3 as recently as last week to have taken krokodil
none of the three suspected cases tested positive for the drug
they instead were likely suffering from needle sharing infections
