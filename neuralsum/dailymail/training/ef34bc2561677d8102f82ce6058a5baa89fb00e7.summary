an earlier picture of rider @entity2 , 26 : she sent friends a text on @entity5 after the fall saying she was fine a woman who fell from her horse while taking part in an event had to be cut out of a car after getting inside to recover			1
rider @entity2 , 26 , is said to have first refused first aid after taking the tumble from her horse when it failed to take a jump			1
but after she was taken to sit inside a @entity16 car , belonging to one of the helpers at the annual horse event at @entity20 at @entity21 , @entity22 , there were fears she might have suffered spinal injuries			1
the @entity25 was called to the farm , and later firefighters removed the car â€™s doors and peeled back its roof so ms @entity2 could be safely removed on a spinal board			1
she was taken to the @entity32 and it is understood she was discharged having suffered cracked ribs at sunday 's event			2
posting on @entity5 she wrote : ' just to let everyone concerned know i am fine , few cracked ribs soft tissue damage bruised lung and spleen but otherwise fine			2
' one spectator , photographer @entity44 , said the rider was lucky not to have been more seriously hurt			0
' her horse , which was a big one , probably about 17 hands , went through the jump rather than over it and she went over its head , ' he said			2
' the horse then jumped over her , it would have been a lot worse if it had landed on her			0
' the horse went through the jump rather than over it and @entity2 went over its head lucky : the horse jumps over @entity2 , leaving her with only a few bruises @entity62 who runs the farm said it was a relief she had not suffered a more serious injury			1
the rider was not wearing body armour while taking part in the annual show and mrs @entity62 said the farm is considering making such protection compulsory for future competitions			0
' we had an emergency staff meeting after the incident and we do not feel there is anything we could have done differently , ' mrs @entity62 said			0
' it was just one those unfortunate things that can happen when working with unpredictable animals like horses			0
leaving nothing to chance : emergency crews cut up the car to get the rider our safely the doors were cut off and the roof peeled open : rider @entity2 had to be brought out of the car on a spinal board better safe than sorry : air ambulance and firefighter were called to the scene - but the rider turned out to be fine ' it is up to each individual rider whether or not they wear the protection , which does not guarantee safety but is better than wearing no protection at all			1
we are now reviewing our rules and regulations			0
' in july the @entity104 flew @entity105 to hospital after she broke her collarbone when she fell from her horse at the same farm .			0

@entity2 's horse went through the jump rather than over it - she went over the horse 's head
rider thought she was fine and went to rest in a parked car , but fears grew she might have suffered spinal injuries
emergency services cut off doors and the roof of the car to get her out safely
