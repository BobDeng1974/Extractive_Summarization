by @entity0 he ’s flashed his toned torso in skin - tight briefs for @entity4 , looked suave in a @entity6 sports car to promote their latest super-sleek model and gazed down at us from many a billboard to promote everything from fashion brands to his own scent			0
but @entity16 ’s latest brand appearance is somewhat less sexy as he gives a cheesy grin on a bottle of @entity20 breath freshener			1
@entity22 's tweet to tell the world about @entity16 's quirky new brand association the above picture was tweeted by @entity22 this weekend with the caption “ genius ! fresh breath @entity16 ! ” perhaps he feels it ’s a worthwhile investment given all those fish oil supplements he ’s reported to take , which do n’t conjure particularly favourable ideas of @entity16 ’s breath			1
