@entity0 has called for cool heads as he reminded @entity3 ’s players they are not racing against time in tuesday ’s collision with @entity5			1
@entity3 need a win to reach the @entity7 ’s last 16 but , as @entity0 pointed out , they only need one goal to knock the @entity10 side out of the tournament			1
part of @entity3 ’s threat under @entity0 ’ last season was the devastating starts that blew teams away – beating @entity17 5 - 1 is perhaps the best example – and there has been a longing from supporters to see that verve return to their play			1
i looked at @entity39 and this game as being key when the draw was made			2
it is up to us to get the job complete , ' he said at the club 's pre-match press conference on monday			1
' this is a competition that has a great history			2
that @entity52 game [ in 2004 ] was a part of the great history			2
it ’s now up to them to write themselves into folklore			2
we ca n’t be relying solely on @entity33 [ @entity33 ]			2
' it is up to other players to be the catalyst			2
when you are world class , the weight falls on your shoulders but for us to get the result we need , we need the team to be functioning at a good level			1
' we are only focusing on the positive			0
if we get through we can put it to bed and that will give us confidence			0
i think we are slowly coming back together after a slow period			0
i have seen signs in recent games of it coming together again			1
' we know it is going to be a tough game but we have seen how the crowd can get behind you			0
if we get through , we can put it behind us and we will have confidence for the rest of our games			1
' @entity3 players are put through their paces during the club 's training session at @entity31 on monday defender @entity90 ( centre ) tries to win the ball from @entity93 during a training exercise @entity30 stopper @entity95 will be hoping to keep a clean sheet against their @entity10 opponents on tuesday in october 's reverse fixture a @entity100 goal gave @entity5 a 1 - 0 win against @entity3			1
however , the @entity10 side have struggled on the road in the @entity7 this season - losing away to @entity105 and @entity39			1
the visitors require just a draw at @entity31 to go through at @entity3 's expense , but @entity0 is confident the @entity30 can get the job done on home turf			1
' we go into the game in a good condition			0
it is going to be a tough game			0
@entity5 have lost their away games so far and i ’m sure they know it is going to be tough			1
we do n’t have to win the game in the first minute			0
we have to retain our patience , play a good technical game			0
if we retain our focus , i believe we will have a great chance			0
we do not underestimate our opponent but our objective is to win and our focus is purely on ourselves to do that			0
' we were a bit soft in our defending			0
we conceded a disappointing goal from a corner			0
it has been a learning period and we have shown in the last few weeks we have been learning			0
we go into the game in a much better mind - set than we were back then			2
@entity0 ( right ) will be hoping the talent of @entity136 will play a major part in tuesday 's crunch tie			1

@entity3 have to beat @entity5 to reach the last 16 of the @entity7
reds trail @entity5 by a point in @entity143 ahead of tuesday 's final match
@entity5 have lost both of their @entity7 away games this season
