@entity0 undergoes tests on injuries after horror crash at @entity4 the 23 - year - old received neck and back injuries after fall jockey conscious after being flown to @entity9 injury came 24 hours after winning big race at @entity12 on @entity13 by @entity14 published : 18:10 est , 7 april 2013 updated : 04:51 est , 8 april 2013 @entity15 - winning rider @entity0 will today undergo a precautionary @entity17 scan following his heavy fall at @entity4 but then hopes to be able to leave hospital			1
the irony , of course , is that if he had not won saturday 's big race , these words would never have seen the light of day			1
on saturday morning , @entity0 was just another ambitious jump jockey recognised by only the keenest of racing fans			2
the @entity0 of 24 hours earlier being airlifted to hospital would hardly have warranted a paragraph in a national newspaper			1
but after his win on @entity32 at @entity12 , i watched him walk into the @entity4 track flanked by security guards			1
the fall : @entity0 falls off @entity35 , into the path of oncoming horses there were no gasps of horror - watching live , things happen too quickly to get a proper perspective - but when @entity0 did not get up immediately , eyes remained on him			1
then green protective screens were erected to treat him in privacy			0
when races end , the crowd normally slip away to bars , tearooms or the paddock			0
but not when things happen like this			0
for 25 minutes , @entity0 was treated on the track and a significant number of concerned spectators did not go anywhere , remaining largely silent and concerned			2
that silence was broken by the noise of the air ambulance but the absence of an announcement meant people on the course were searching for information as he was loaded on to the aircraft on a spinal board			0
medical assistance : the @entity68 lands at @entity69 next to the fence where @entity15 - winning jockey @entity0 fell on sunday the @entity68 prepares to take off from @entity69 next to the fence where @entity15 winning jockey @entity0 fell today , just 24 hours after he stormed to victory at @entity12 on 66 - 1 outsider @entity32			1
it seems people watching on television always get more information than those at the track - which is wrong			2
but clerk of the course @entity81 calmed fears , telling me they hoped the situ ation was not as serious as it looked			0
@entity81 said : ' his agent and partner are with him			0
he has had some scans and they are waiting for the results			0
' and it was a great relief later to see that @entity0 himself had tweeted good news , saying : ' thanks so much for all the messages			2
staying in hospital to get another scan tomorrow then should be home			0
# highsandlows ' i can remember @entity98 , son of @entity99 , being admitted to hospital following a horror fall less than two hours after winning the @entity102 on his mother 's @entity103			1
luckily i never had such a dramatic reversal of fortune in such quick succession			0
but it just illustrates the thin line between triumph and disaster that is a jump jockey 's working life			2
mount : @entity0 riding @entity114 ( no 8 , centre ) moments before his fall at @entity4 before the race : @entity0 ( left ) takes his place in the enclosure at @entity4 before his fall victory : @entity0 , pictured here second from the right , won the @entity15 with @entity32 underdog : he was rated at 66/1 but was regardless a success pre-accident picture : mania with his @entity15 winning horse @entity32 yesterday morning just hours before his fall			1
