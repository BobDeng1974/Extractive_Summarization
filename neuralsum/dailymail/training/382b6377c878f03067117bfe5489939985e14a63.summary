only the brightest study at our elite universities … but if your name is @entity5 or @entity6 , you have a natural advantage			0
a study showed yesterday that despite the dramatic changes in our lifestyles during the past 800 years , the same names have dominated the student rolls at @entity13 and @entity14 over that time			1
researchers found that there have been @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 at the two universities for 27 generations , their prestige unbroken by historic upheavals and technological revolutions			1
the unchallenged status of great wealth has meant that the same names who were at the top of the social scale in the time of @entity33 remain among the elite now , the report said			1
oozing class : it 's no coincidence that @entity37 's mr @entity5 , played by @entity38 , came from landed gentry			0
according to researchers from the @entity41 , @entity5 is one of many @entity43 names that continues to command wealth and power what 's in a name ? among the names of power is the surname of footballing brothers @entity53 , left , and @entity54 by contrast there are some family names whose bearers were poor 150 years ago who are still likely to remain outside the ranks of the wealthy			1
among the poorer surnames - selected by researchers because they are relatively rare and the family line can more easily be traced - are @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72			1
the researchers from the @entity41 , dr @entity73 and professor @entity74 , said the name checks showed that social mobility in @entity77 is hardly greater than in medieval times , and that people inherited their social status even more than they inherit their height			1
the researchers from the @entity41 used 800 years of history to compile their top and bottom ten , above dr @entity73 said : ‘ just take the names of the @entity86 who conquered @entity77 nearly 1,000 years ago			1
surnames such as @entity89 , @entity5 , @entity90 and @entity91 are still over-represented at @entity92 and also among elite occupations such as medicine , law and politics			2
‘ what is surprising is that between 1800 and 2011 there have been substantial institutional changes in @entity77 but no gain in rates of social mobility for society as a whole			0
’ the study comes at a time of widespread concern about social mobility as large - scale research suggests that those born to less well - off families have had less chance of success since the 1970s			0
much of the blame has been pinned on the education system , with left - wingers attacking universities for failing to admit students from poor backgrounds , while right - wingers say the abolition of the grammar schools cut off the way up for working class children			0
the @entity41 research said that the spread of mass education over the past 150 years has done nothing to break the grip of the longstanding elite on positions of power , and that the same families have been on top despite centuries of religious reformation , civil war , industrial revolution , the growth of democracy and education , and the birth of the welfare state			1
conventional estimates say it takes three to five generations for a wealthy family to fall to the middle ground and a poor family to rise to the same level			2
the researchers tested the idea by examining student rolls for @entity13 and @entity14 universities going back to 1170 , four years after the @entity154			2
the two institutions were the only universities in @entity77 until 1832 and continue to accept only the best - qualified students			0
' there has been modest improvement in social mobility rates between the medieval era and the modern world , with that change occurring around 1800 , ' the researchers said			2
but they added : ' the remarkable status persistence found using @entity92 attendance as the status measure is found just as strongly with a more general and democratic measure of status such as asset ownership			0
' over the generations there were substantial increases in the rate of taxation of wealth and income , especially after 1910			0
yet this did nothing to increase rates of wealth mobility			0

@entity182 surnames has been unbroken for 27 generations
poorer names like @entity67 , @entity69 and @entity186 remained less *fortunate*
