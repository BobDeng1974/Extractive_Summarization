it is a rebrand aimed at helping students track down a university 's website more quickly			1
but @entity5 's attempts to trademark a rather rude word as part of an image change might just leave those students somewhat offended			1
according to @entity12 , the university has attempted to patent the @entity13			2
rebranding ? the @entity14 has reportedly applied for several rather unfortunate patents the name could cause offence if , as so many educational institution 's names are , the university is known in its unpublishable acronym form			1
the @entity23 uni has also reportedly applied to trademark the @entity26 name			2
a slightly more publishable acronym , but one that could still leave the uni open to much sniggering is @entity29 , derived from a third name the university has attempted to make its own , the @entity32			0
but the suggested trademark that could land the university in particularly hot water is the idea it could become the @entity37			0
current name : the institution 's current guise is unlikely to offend that name is likely to offend people from both @entity5 and @entity43 , neither of whom are quick to welcome being associated with their neighbouring town			1
a @entity5 spokesman told @entity48 : ' we have registered these new trademarks to help students who may be searching for us on the web , particularly international students			1
' they are all common variations that people may search for and they will simply help interested students find us quicker			0
' an @entity57 raised eyebrows last month when students were seen wearing their new pride t - shirts emblazoned with the letters ' wtf '			0
the students , from the @entity64 in @entity65 , insisted that the letters respectfully referred to we 're the @entity68			0
but some parents disagreed , with the letters more commonly used as a popular acronym for ' what the f * * * ' .			0

@entity5 has reportedly tried to patent the @entity76 name
potential students could be left offended by the name which *carries* a rather rude acronym
