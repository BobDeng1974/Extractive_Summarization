buildings of the future may have mirrors that reflect sunlight into space to keep them cool			2
developers of the new technology hope the concept could lead to a cheaper and more sustainable form of air conditioning			1
their incredibly thin material offloads heat from the sun into space in the form of infrared radiation , and could keep buildings 5 ° c ( 9 ° f ) cooler than the surrounding air during the day			1
scientists at @entity20 in @entity21 have created an ultra-reflective mirror			1
the incredibly thin material reflects infrared light from buildings ( illustration shown ) , and it could be placed on top of buildings to keep them cool in hot weather by reflecting infrared radiation into space the technology was developed by scientists at @entity20 in @entity21			1
it consists of a multi-layered material that is just 1.8 millionths of a metre thick , thinner than the thinnest aluminium foil			0
this material is made of seven layers of silicon dioxide and hafnium oxide on top of a layer of silver			0
@entity44 can be transferred in three ways : conduction , convection and radiation			0
this material deals with the latter , reflecting infrared light directly into space			1
the ultrathin coating was carefully constructed to send this infrared light away from buildings at the precise frequency that allows it to pass through the atmosphere without warming the air , a key feature given the dangers of global warming			1
professor @entity61 of @entity20 said it was ' like having a window into space '			0
the coating prevents 97 per cent of sunlight from striking the building and heating it up			2
this can make the building @entity69 ( 9 ° f ) cooler than the surrounding air during the day			1
the internal structure of the material radiates incoming infrared rays back into space			0
invisible light in the form of infrared radiation is one of the ways that all objects and living things throw off heat			0
for example , when standing in front of an oven without touching it , the heat felt is infrared light			2
@entity90 , in a similar way , radiates heat to @entity92 and can significantly warm buildings in the hottest parts of the world unless they have air conditioning			1
this cheaper method would prevent electricity needing to be used for air conditioning , and would instead just constantly keep buildings cool			1
about 15 per cent of energy used in buildings in the @entity103 is apparently spent powering air conditioning systems			1
the material would need to be installed on the roof of a building , where it would reflect heat straight back up into space			0
the new material reflects 97 % of sunlight , making the building 5 ° c ( 9 ° f ) cooler than the surrounding air			1
they say it is a cheaper solution to air conditioning ( stock image shown ) as the planet warms as it is highly reflective , placing it on the side of buildings would probably not be an option , as it would radiate heat onto the ground and potentially heat up populated areas such as cities			1
but its potential for use on the top of buildings is obvious , and the team also think it could be used as a spray - on material to make objects more able to withstand the elements			2
the researchers said that as the planet gets warmer , such cooling technologies that do n't require power might become more commonplace			0
' across the developing world , photonic radiative cooling makes off - grid cooling a possibility in rural regions , in addition to meeting skyrocketing demand for air conditioning in urban areas , ' said lead author dr @entity152			2
right now the @entity20 team 's prototype is the size of a personal pizza , but cooling buildings will require larger panels			2
the researchers say there exist large - area fabrication facilities that can make their panels at the scales needed , which will be needed before the prototype can be developed further			0
more broadly , the team sees this project as a first step toward using the cold of space as a resource			0
in the same way that sunlight provides a renewable source of solar energy , the cold universe supplies a nearly unlimited expanse to dump heat			0
' every object that produces heat has to dump that heat into a heat sink , ' @entity177 said			0
' what we 've done is to create a way that should allow us to use the coldness of the universe as a heat sink during the day			0
