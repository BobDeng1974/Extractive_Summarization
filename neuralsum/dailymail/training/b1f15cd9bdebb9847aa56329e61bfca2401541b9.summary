@entity1 prop @entity0 has written an open letter to @entity4 supporters after signing for @entity5			1
the 33 - year - old said he ' could n't wait forever ' for his playing future to be resolved , in a letter published by the @entity9			1
@entity10 tighthead @entity0 has been out of work since his @entity4 contract expired at the end of last season			1
' as pretty much the whole world and his wife will know by now , i had been waiting for a deal to be struck between the regions and the @entity27 over a new participation agreement so the @entity4 could conclude a fresh contract with me , ' he said			1
' i have n't been getting any money , but i was just hoping that the row that has blighted @entity27 rugby for so long could be finally settled and i could pull on the black shirt again			2
' then on sunday morning i received a call from the @entity5 asking whether i fancied a move there			0
i had to think long and hard about their proposal because i know all about regional rivalry and how much it matters in @entity1			0
@entity15 : @entity0 is nearing the end of his career but hopes to be part of the @entity1 setup for the @entity53 ' but my circumstances were such that i did n't feel i could turn @entity55 down			1
i have n't been paid for two months and the season is barely a fortnight away			1
i need to be properly attached to a team and training with a group of players in readiness for the new campaign			0
' i could n't wait forever			1
the contract with the @entity4 has been on the table since january , but without signatures it meant only so much			2
' no - one is to blame			0
@entity67 ( @entity4 chief executive ) and @entity69 ( head coach ) have been straight down the line with me throughout the negotiations			2
they have n't messed me about and i do n't think i have messed anyone about , either			0
' @entity0 , meanwhile , predicted a bright future for the @entity4			1
reluctant mover : @entity0 ( right ) says he waited as long as he could but had not been paid in two months ' they are going through a rebuilding phase , but with someone like @entity80 ( @entity0 ) there - an immense presence in every respect - i still expect them to be pushing for a play - off place in the @entity86 , ' he added			1
' there are also a lot of young players at the region who are going to make @entity27 rugby sit up and take notice in the years ahead			0
' but a new chapter starts for me now , and i 'm just glad i 'll be able to focus on rugby again			0
' every player goes through bad times as well as good during his career , and the brilliant thing about @entity4 ' supporters is that they have always been there for me when things have n't been going as well as i might have wanted			0
' i will appreciate that for the rest of my career and beyond			0
it has been quality all the way			0
' done deal : @entity0 signs for the @entity5 after a long period of uncertainty about his club future			2
