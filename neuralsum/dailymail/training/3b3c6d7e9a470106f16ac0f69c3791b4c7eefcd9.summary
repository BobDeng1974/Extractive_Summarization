sex fiend @entity2 , 41 , told one of his victims : ‘ i do n’t believe this , i ’m a good - looking bloke			1
’ @entity2 , previously a captain in the @entity6 @entity14 , who carried out the attacks over a 15 year period between 1996 and 2011 , even met two of his victims through an internet dating website and the others in bars			1

judge @entity33 said : ‘ there is no doubt in my mind that you pose a very real danger to women and the only appropriate sentence is one of imprisonment for public protection			0

smile of a predator : this photo was used by @entity2 on his dating website profile shame of a disgraced rapist : another picture @entity2 used online to attract women ‘ each of them described , in chilling evidence , your change from plausible and caring into a bullying , self - obsessed , arrogant sexual predator who was determined to indulge in fulfilling your sexual desires irrespective and dismissive of their pleas that you should desist			1
’ the fact that no action was taken after the first three complaints , he said , led him to feel as though he was ‘ untouchable ’ by the authorities			0
he went on : ‘ with the benefit of hindsight , it is perhaps too easy to say that had you been successfully prosecuted in 1995 , you may well not have been free to commit these other , later , serious offences			0
’ ‘ it is to the benefits of justice ’ , he said , ‘ that each of your three earlier victims did have the courage to not only make their original complaints but to come before the court so many years later and tell the jury what you had done to them and to relive the traumatic experience			2
’ the victim impact statements , he said , ‘ speaks in harrowing terms of the long - term consequences of your actions on them ... it is clear that what you did to each of them has changed their lives immeasurably			2
‘ it has resulted in distrust , if not fear , of other relationships			0
it has had adverse consequences on their work and social lives			0
‘ if anyone ever doubted the devastating long - term consequences of rape or sexual assault , these statements provide eloquent testimony against such doubts			2
you actions changed forever their lives and the lives of their close family and friends			0
’ the fact that no initial action was taken ‘ led inevitably to feelings of loss of self - worth and despair that they had not been believed ’ , he said , adding : ‘ justice has been for too long delayed			0
