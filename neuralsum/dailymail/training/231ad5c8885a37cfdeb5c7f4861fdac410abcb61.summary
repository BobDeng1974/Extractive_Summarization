by @entity0 last updated at 3:05 pm on 13th october 2011 the war between @entity2 and @entity3 shows no sign of abating , as the release date of @entity8 rumbles ever closer - and many of @entity3 's products remain paralysed in legal limbo by @entity2 lawsuits			1
now it seems @entity3 is going to strike back			0
' we 'll be pursuing our rights for this in a more aggressive way from now on , ' @entity15 , head of global marketing for the company 's mobile division said this week			0
@entity15 also said that @entity2 was ' free riding ' on @entity3 wireless technologies - lending credibility to rumours that @entity3 would attempt to torpedo @entity8 5 before its @entity28 launch			1
too similar ? @entity3 's @entity30 touchscreens and @entity8 are currently the subject of a bitter legal dispute in several countries ever since @entity2 launched its @entity8 , it 's been an open secret that @entity3 makes many of the components inside it - in fact @entity3 's ceo has admitted , ' @entity2 is our biggest customer			1
' but ever since @entity3 launched its own @entity30 series of phones and tablets - high - powered touchscreens whose flagship , the @entity45 , currently outpaces @entity8 on the processing front - legal war has erupted between the companies in nine countries			2
a @entity3 executive told the @entity51 this week , ' when the @entity8 arrives here , @entity3 plans to take @entity2 to court here for its violation of @entity3 's wireless technology related patents			1
' this is in response to @entity2 's continued legal action against @entity3 's @entity30 family of touchscreen tablets and smartphones - some of which are currently illegal in @entity28 , thanks to @entity2 lawsuits claiming they are ' slavish ' copies of @entity8 and @entity66			1
@entity3 recently overtook @entity67 in the smartphone market , and its @entity45 offers a larger screen and faster processor than @entity71 - and has been a huge hit among geeky smartphone connoisseurs			0
this month , @entity2 even forced @entity3 to withdraw a prototype tablet device from the show floor of a @entity77 electronics show			2
@entity3 's larger @entity30 10.1 tablet remains illegal in @entity28 thanks to @entity2 's legal action			1
the @entity80 reported that the @entity82 firm may seek an injunction against @entity2 's new @entity8 in @entity28			2
@entity3 said it would not comment on ongoing legal issues			0
legal battle rages between @entity2 and @entity3 over alleged ' similarities between their touchscreen smartphones and handsets the two technology firms have been locked in intensifying legal battles in nine countries over their flagship smartphone and tablet products - battles made more complex by the fact that many related patents are held by other internet giants such as @entity98 and @entity99			2
the latest attacks come after @entity2 successfully blocked @entity3 from selling its latest tablets in @entity102 and some smartphone models in the @entity104 and forced its rival to delay launching new tablets in @entity107			0
after @entity2 's latest legal victory in @entity102 earlier this month , @entity3 said it would take all available legal options			0
@entity2 first sued @entity3 in april , claiming its strongest competitor had ' slavishly ' copied its product designs , and @entity3 had since counter-sued , arguing @entity2 infringed on its mobile technologies .			0

@entity3 ' will be more aggressive ' from now on
company ' will sue ' to stop @entity8 in @entity116 - and *possibly* @entity28
@entity2 is ' free - riding ' on our technology , says @entity3
