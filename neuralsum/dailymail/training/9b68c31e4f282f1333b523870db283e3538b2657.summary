by @entity0 for @entity1 food and fashion is n't the most likely of pairings , however one @entity7 bakery is determined to marry the two together			1
@entity8 in @entity7 's @entity9 runs with the ethos ' food is my fashion ' and creates delicious bespoke cakes inspired by the latest catwalk trends			1
the bakery is the brain child of @entity18 and her wife @entity19 and draws on @entity18 's experience in the fashion industry to create the stylish sweets which such as ' @entity24 star biscuits ' and ' @entity25 '			1
fashionable foodie : @entity18 set up @entity28 's bakery where she combines her style knowledge with her passion for baking @entity18 is no stranger to fashion having worked as a fashion writer , editor and stylist for top global magazines including @entity36 and @entity37			1
she had previously dipped her toes into the catering world by helping to cater for events hosted by @entity19 in her role as ceo of global event company for the stars @entity45			1
@entity18 had always dreamed of opening her own bakery and finally quit the fashion rat race to pursue her passion nine months ago			1
if anyone is able to fuse the unlikely pair of fashion and food @entity18 is the woman for the job but even she admits that it is n't the most obvious combination			1
' as a stylist , for me i have always related fashion back to food which is a bit of a weird combination but it comes down to the same concept			1
' it 's about creating a look and editing it down , both industries are very entwined			1
' celebrity favourite : @entity28 attracts all sorts of famous faces including @entity69 and @entity70 for @entity18 the process of turning haute couture into hot cakes is one that requires a lot of thought			1
the pieces that inspire her creations affect everything from the decoration right down to the texture of the cake			1
' i look at the brand and the latest catwalk images and i examine the colours and get a feel for the trend			1
i look at the fabrics , are they light ? then i might create a lighter cake			1
' @entity18 is well aware of the fashion industry 's mild phobia of sugary food and has catered accordingly			1
' i think about who would buy the clothes if they were female then maybe i would make a brownie bite rather than a great big slab			1
' @entity28 's bakery gained it 's title from @entity18 's nickname after friends compared her to the @entity104 bunny			1
however , @entity18 is not one to lend her name to a company she is n't involved with and insists on being as hands on as possible			1
@entity18 was inspired by the floral design of @entity109 , right , when she created these lemon and pistachio cupcakes knows her stuff : before opening the bakery had worked at many fashion publications including @entity36 and @entity37 ' the bakery has been open nine months now and i am there every morning			1
we are a little local bakery and opening a small business is really competitive			1
' i think it is really important to go in every day in order to build up a relationship with your customers			1
' @entity18 has entered an industry that is booming			1
the first episode of this year 's @entity128 off fetched viewing figures of 6.3million and @entity131 's empire is currently worth a tasty £ 5m			1
@entity18 agrees that she has entered the business at the right time and she believes that we all deserve a treat			1
' oh there ’s definitely a huge trend for baking right now			2
everyone works so hard these days i think baking provides that bit of escapism especially during the winter when you ’re nesting a bit more			2
' it 's great to produce something where you know where all of the ingredients have come from			1
i think that is really important to people these days because we are all so educated about food origins			2
' that 's another thing about @entity18 , she knows her audience and is n't as complacent to believe that she can make a business out of pretty cakes alone			1
the 32 - year - old has now expanded the bakery into a deli too selling gourmet sandwiches every lunch time			2
' and we have three different kinds of sausage rolls ! ' she adds			2
' we have also just got a license to sell alcohol which is great so customers can buy a lovely red or rose that i have picked out and take it away for dinner			2
' despite having been open for less than a year , @entity28 has gained itself quite the reputation with several celebrities frequenting the bakery			1
' @entity69 comes in all the time , ' says @entity18 adding that her bakery is soon to make an appearance in a @entity183 blockbuster			1
' @entity184 and @entity70 have been filming absolutely anything together and they set some of it in the shop			1
we closed it for four days so i hope they do n't edit us out ! ' although @entity18 is thrilled to have attracted several a-listers her ambitions for her shop lie much closer to home			1
' we want people to come and buy their morning coffee from us rather than a coffee chain where it all tastes a bit burnt			2
' me and @entity19 always regret the things we do n't do and we wanted to make something that our community would be proud of			2
