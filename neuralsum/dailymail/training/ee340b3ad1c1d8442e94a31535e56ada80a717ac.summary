when the @entity3 draw was made @entity1 v @entity0 looked a shoo - in for @entity5 ’s team			1
but after being crushed by @entity6 , relying too heavily on a not fully fit @entity5 and with a crumbling squad @entity0 could well be eliminated on sunday			1
and history shows that the @entity1 - who can clinch qualification with a win - have a good record against the @entity13			1
however , the @entity30 have won the last two encounters including the 3 - 2 group stage victory during the @entity3 2002			1
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... @entity33 seek to restore some pride against @entity35 on sunday night but that wo n’t be easy against a @entity35 side who have been unlucky to lose both of their games against @entity42 and @entity43			2
and it ’s not only the fallen world champions who face a period of transition with @entity49 also expected to experience some changes this summer			2
until recently , the @entity52 giants were regarded as the best club team on the planet			1
@entity55 , who has for so long been the heart beat of @entity33 and @entity49 , is set to quit the @entity58 club this summer and move to the @entity59 or @entity60			2
end of an era ? following @entity33 's horrendous @entity3 campaign , @entity49 star @entity55 looks set for a move @entity70 v @entity64 - on air during @entity68 ’s prime time slot at 8pm on sunday - is hardly one to woo viewers			1
even up against @entity73 ( there ’s a few @entity75 jokes in there somewhere )			2
but it could be worth watching just to see blunder prone presenter @entity78 come out with some crass joke about either country , or roll out an old gag like who the first @entity84 player to appear in the @entity86			0
* for the record @entity70 had three @entity89 - based players last season - recently - released @entity91 striker @entity90 , who spent part of last term on loan at @entity95 last season , @entity98 's @entity97 and @entity100 's @entity99 - young			1
@entity64 have two in @entity102 ’s @entity101 and @entity104 ’s @entity103			0
* it was of course @entity107 of @entity108 ( boom boom ! ) @entity110 , scorer one of the greatest @entity3 goals of all - time with his ' @entity113 ' volley againjst @entity42 , bows out of international football on sunday night in @entity35 's ' dead rubber ' clash with @entity33			1
but it may not be the last we see of the 34 year - old midfield marauder			1
when he finishes the @entity123 season with @entity124 i hear @entity110 could be tempted back to the @entity86 for one last hurrah			0
@entity125 and @entity100 are interested			0
pick that one out : @entity110 netted possibly the best goal of the tournament so far in @entity128 in an attempt to put a bright spin on it all at the post-mortem press conference @entity129 suggested that @entity75 have a bright future ahead of them			0
not sure such soothing words were worth the headlines			0
after all what was he going to say : ' it ’s time to pack up , go home and turn of of all the lights … we ’re doomed			0
' some might have hoped he 'd added : ' it ’s now time to give the next generation a go … so i ’m stepping aside			0
good luck lads ' here is a possible team to play at @entity151 … without @entity129			1
@entity152 ; @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 ; @entity157 , @entity158 ; @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 ; @entity162			0
and yours ? that said there is every chance that @entity129 will be given the @entity75 captaincy			0
but it understood an alternative is goalkeeper @entity152			0
@entity170 : some might hope @entity129 walks away from the national team but there is every chance he could be captain for @entity75 's @entity175 campaign @entity176 the @entity177 must surely review the near £ 2 million cost of their @entity180 training camp which included a staggering support staff of 77 … one for every three players			1
yet incredibly despite all the back up , luxury hotel and superb training pitch , i hear that some players still found time to complain about the drive time on the team bus from the hotel to the training ground			2
that was largely due to traffic			0
the moans illustrate the pampered nature of yet another @entity75 squad at a major tournament where egos outweighed energy			0
if one of the most high profile of the backroom staff , sports psychiatrist dr @entity206 , could n’t solve that problem or confront the mental fragility of some of the players then his inclusion in the ' party ' was a waste of time and money			0
bet of the day it ’s been a high - scoring tournament so @entity217 to beat @entity218 and four our more goals to be scored in the game is at 5 - 1 … a decent price given @entity217 are 10/11 to win			1
both @entity70 and @entity64 need to win - the unwanted draw is an attractive 21/10 @entity3 moment @entity225 stole a march on @entity227 with their dancing celebration after scoring against @entity6			1
so it 's appropriate to pay homage to the man who started it all … @entity235 striker @entity234 who , at the age of 42 , took the @entity238 storm with his goals and corner flag jives .			2

@entity0 have only *collected* one point this @entity3 campaign
@entity5 's team were hammered 4 - 0 by @entity6 in their opening game
