by @entity0 published : 10:02 est , 23 may 2013 updated : 19:59 est , 23 may 2013 row : dr @entity1 said gps were fed up with being blamed for chaos in @entity5 departments doctors yesterday accused @entity7 of ‘ spouting rubbish ’ , after he said their controversial contracts had led to worse services for patients			1
the head of the @entity14 ’s gp committee said doctors were being made the ‘ whipping boys ’ for wider problems in the @entity18			2
dr @entity1 said it was unfair to blame doctors for the increased pressure at accident and emergency departments			1
the war of words has escalated in recent weeks , with the health secretary insisting family doctors must once again take ultimate responsibility for round - the - clock care			2
mr @entity7 has angered gps by suggesting the out - of - hours arrangements introduced in 2004 are partly to blame for the @entity5 crisis , and he stepped up his criticism by condemning the scandal of out - of - hours services where ‘ you speak to a doctor who does n’t know you from @entity38 ’			1
he acknowledged that the causes of the @entity5 crisis were ‘ complex ’ , and partly explained by @entity41 ’s ageing population , but said doctors could take more ‘ responsibility ’ for their patients			1
he said : ‘ we need to have a clinician accountable for those people when they are outside hospital just in the same way a consultant is responsible for them when they are inside hospital , if we are going to give them the kind of care we all want the @entity18 to do			2
it ’s a big change and i think the gp contract is part of the problem			2
’ personal service : patients should know that one family doctor ( file picture ) is responsible for them , and even if their gp is not on call it will be clear that ' the buck stops ' with them , health secretary @entity7 insists accusing mr @entity7 of ‘ spouting rubbish ’ on the issue , mr @entity1 said : ‘ he does not want to bother with the facts when he can have a bash at those of us who on his own admission are overworked and strained beyond endurance			1
‘ gps are not prepared to shore up a system that has been rendered unsafe by political meddling			0
’ mr @entity1 said the ‘ botched ’ introduction of the non-emergency 111 phone line had left people ‘ confused ’ about where to go for care			2
he added : ‘ people who go to @entity5 are not going because of @entity76			0
there is no doubt some of it is because people are confused about how to get access to out - of - hours services and some of it is because @entity18 is sending people there			1
‘ but some of it is about a rapid rise in demand			0
we are seeing more people than ever before			0
’ mr @entity7 , who wants to introduce a new chief inspector of @entity76 , said reform was urgently needed			0
he insisted many gps were keen to make changes that would allow them to devote more attention to their patients			0
mr @entity7 insisted the @entity104 government 's 2004 contracts for @entity76 were in part to blame for problems being seen now mr @entity7 said he did not want to return to the days of gps getting calls directly from patients at 2am , adding he acknowledged they worked extremely hard			1
‘ what i question is whether we are allowing them to do the things they went into general practice to do			0
‘ what we make them do on the contract is make them tick lots and lots of boxes			0
i want to change that			0
i think the current gp contract is fundamentally flawed by removing responsibility for out - of - hours services from gps			1
’ mr @entity7 added that the ‘ buck should stop ’ with gps for out - of - hours care			1
while family doctors should n’t have to personally deliver such care for their patients , they should have to ‘ sign off ’ to confirm that they are pleased with the service that is providing care , he said .			0

dr @entity1 says gps are not to blame for @entity5 crisis
accuses @entity7 of *deflecting* attention from @entity18 111 problems
