by @entity0 the @entity3 ought to just take the @entity5 children pouring into the country through its border with @entity9 , stick them on a bus and send them back home as soon as they arrive , @entity2 congressman @entity1 said at a @entity13 hearing this morning			1
that 's what the @entity3 does with adults who illegally enter the country , the @entity19 congressman said , ' why are n't we putting them on a bus like we normally do and send them back down to @entity23 ? ' ' i do n't know why these children are being treated any differently , ' he said			1
' what are we doin ' other than takin ' ' em and puttin ' ' em in a facility here that 's gon na make it more likely we will keep them here for months if not years ? ' he said			1
members also expressed concern over what the @entity37 administration was doing to correct the record about @entity3 immigration policy and what steps it was taking to deter parents in @entity5 countries from putting their children 's lives at risk by handing them over to smugglers			1
coyotes are promulgating rumors that children who make it across the @entity3 border will receive amnesty through president @entity37 's @entity71 program or his immigration reform legislation that 's stalled in the @entity73			1
neither would apply to new immigrants crossing the border , but criminal networks have successfully convinced thousands of children from @entity23 , @entity79 and @entity80 to illegally immigrate to the @entity3 since @entity37 's @entity71 program was announced two years ago			1
on the trip many children are mentally and physically abused at the hands of the smugglers			0
' i think the saddest thing about this whole story is the exploitation of the children , ' committee chair @entity86 said , noting that he never thought he 'd see detention centers at the border turn into ' refugee camps			0
' shoes for children that have been donated for immigrants sit on a table at @entity99 sister @entity100 helps sort a donation of shoes in a warehouse at the @entity104 in @entity105 , @entity106			0
over the weekend 10 tons of donations were received to help the @entity108 in its response to an influx of women and children immigrants from @entity5 the diocese of @entity105 and @entity114 of @entity105 are working together to collect and deliver the items to detention facilities a 2008 law requires the @entity13 to turn over all unaccompanied minors to the @entity119 within 72 hours			1
that is not happening most of the time , @entity121 administrator @entity120 admitted during today 's hearing , and the children are piling up at detention facilities			2
the federal agency , which was tasked by president @entity37 to coordinate the humanitarian relief to the children , has worked increase its in - take capacity , but the number of unaccompanied minors crossing the border is rising at a faster rate than either @entity13 or @entity119 is able to keep up with			1
@entity86 noted during his opening statements that 52,000 children had illegally immigrated to the @entity3 since last october , and the @entity139 agency expects approximately 100,000 to arrive before the end of the fiscal year			1
more than 250 are apprehended every day , he said			0
@entity35 chairman @entity86 said 52,000 unaccompanied minors had illegally immigrated to the @entity3 since last october and 100,000 are expected to arrive by the end of the fiscal year ' i 'm very concerned that this recent surge is weakening our border security efforts here at home , ' @entity86 said , because border enforcement officers are being diverted away from their main duty , which is to stop drug smugglers			1
' cartels will no doubt take advantage of this situation , ' he said			0
@entity86 called on president @entity37 to send the national guard down to the border to help ease the burden being placed on border patrol			1
@entity119 does not have enough space to licensed professionals on hand to take care of the children , @entity120 said , or space to put them in , which is why @entity119 is n't fulfilling the requirements its legally bound to			2
as a stop - gap solution to the humanitarian crisis , @entity120 said in testimony , @entity121 is working toward getting the kids beds within the @entity139 detention facilities so they at least wo n't be sleeping on the cold , hard concrete			0
but the more ' proper humanitarian measures ' the @entity3 takes , the more the government makes being held in a @entity3 detention facility something that encourages children to make the unsafe journey from their home countries to the @entity3 , @entity179 congressman @entity178 said during the hearing			1
@entity1 concurred during his testimony			0
' right now we have a crisis , and i do n't see this administration doing anything about it other than trying to house the children , ' he said			0
the rise in the number of illegal immigrants has caused a strain on the @entity193 's resources			0
earlier this month it posted a notice asking for bids on an order for 3,500 pairs of @entity201 % @entity200 underwear , sizes medium through @entity203			0
' this is a normal solicitation for routinely procured items needed at @entity205 - owned detention facilities around the country , ' an @entity205 spokesperson told @entity210 on monday			0
' at @entity205 - owned detention facilities , the agency is required to provide basic necessities in order to feed and clothe detained aliens			0
' the pairs of underwear are for a detention facility in @entity80 , @entity219 , @entity106			0
' and i understand the humanitarian basis for that , but we need send a signal to these other countries that it 's not gon na work			1
you ca n't send your children up here and let ' em stay			1
we 're gon na turn ' em right back and give ' em right back to you			2
' @entity33 said during his testimony that the federal government was in fact doing addressing the situation outside of humanitarian concerns about the way the illegal immigrant children are being treated inside of the detention facilities , which has become a major focus of the border crisis in recent weeks			0
the @entity3 is sending 150 additional border patrol agents down to the @entity243 river area , where most of the children are crossing he said			0
the government is also in talks with the leaders of @entity9 , @entity23 , @entity80 and @entity79 about how the countries can work together to provide a better life for the children in their home countries and get the word out that children who make it across the @entity3 border alive do n't get a ' free pass ' into the country , @entity33 said			1
' i think whatcha need to do is ask the @entity23 government where they want these kids dropped off when the bus is bringin ' em back down there , ' @entity1 said , rather than asking how the @entity3 could be helping the third world countries more			2
the @entity266 announced on friday , that the @entity3 is giving @entity5 countries $ 250 million of new aid			2
a large chunk of that money will go to gang prevention programs in the region , only a small part , $ 9.6 million , will go toward expanding repatriation centers in the countries			0
@entity33 said today that @entity13 would be leaning on other agencies , including the @entity277 , to try to get the children returned to their home countries more quickly			2
the most ' critical ' step that the @entity3 can take at this time in resolving the crisis , @entity33 said , is to correct the record about @entity3 immigration laws .			2

more than 250 children are illegally immigrating to the @entity3 every day and 100,000 are expected to arrive by the end of the fiscal year
many of them are unaccompanied minors coming from @entity5 by way of @entity9
smugglers have convinced @entity5 children and their parents that they will get amnesty through @entity3 president @entity37 's *relaxed* *deportation* policies if they hurry up and immigrate to @entity5
the @entity299 and @entity119 have been *overwhelmed* by the mass migration and have been unable to come up with enough beds for children to sleep on
at a @entity35 hearing today one @entity19 congressman asked the @entity37 administration why it could n't just send the kids back to their home countries on buses back to their home countries
' what are we doin ' other than takin ' ' em and puttin ' ' em in a facility here that 's gon na make it more likely we will keep them here for months if not years ? ' he said
members of @entity42 were generally concerned that the administration was not doing enough to correct the record about the president 's immigration policies
