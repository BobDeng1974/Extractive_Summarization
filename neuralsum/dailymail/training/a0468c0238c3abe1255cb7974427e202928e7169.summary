by @entity0 @entity3 glaciers in @entity4 are shedding ice at a much faster rate than expected , a new report claims			1
the amount of ice draining from six massive glaciers in @entity4 has increased by 77 per cent between 1973 and 2013 , according to the report findings			1
researchers studied the @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity18 glaciers , which discharge ice into the @entity20			2
ice from just these six glaciers accounted for 10 per cent of the world 's sea - level rise between 2005 and 2010 , the study by the @entity23 claims			1
cracks in the ice : six of the fastest flowing glaciers in @entity4 are shedding ice at an accelerated rate this means the six glaciers are discharging nearly the same amount of ice as the entire @entity37 ice sheet			1
@entity12 , the most active of the glaciers studies which has made headlines after dropping huge icebergs into the sea , is discharging 75 per cent more ice into the ocean than it was 40 years ago			1
the widest glacier included in the research - @entity13 - started to have accelerated levels of ice loss in 2006			0
concerning : a massive crack can be seen across the @entity12 in this satellite image			0
the glacier is shedding 75 per cent more ice into the ocean than it was 40 years ago @entity53 , a glaciologist at @entity23 and co-author of the paper , said : ' what we found was a sustained increase in ice discharge â€” which has a significant impact on sea level rise			1
' the researchers studied cracks on the glaciers every year to see how much they had spread and to calculate ice discharge			0
if the glaciers were to collapse completely , sea levels would rise by another four feet ( 1.2 metres ) , claims fellow report co-author professor @entity68			2
' to see @entity13 , this monster glacier , start accelerating in 2006 means we could see even more change in the near future that could affect sea level , ' @entity53 added			0
if the six glaciers studied were to collapse completely , sea levels would rise by a catastrophic four feet he added that the acceleration in glacier flow is being aided by warmer ocean waters			2
huge ice streams flowing from @entity4 are held back by floating ice shelves that act like dams			1
but recent studies have suggest the warmer ocean water is melting and thinning these ice shelves from below			0
this means the ice shelves give less resistance to the streams , forcing more ice into the ocean			0
cracks can be seen running across the @entity91			0
it is believed warmer ocean water is contributing to the acceleration of the glaciers			0

study looked at six of the fastest flowing glaciers in @entity4
they are *collectively* shedding ice 77 **%** faster than they were in 1973
now shed the same amount of ice as the entire @entity37 ice sheet
ice from these glaciers accounts for 10 **%** of the annual sea - level rise
