but he also wants to ban developers hoarding land which could be built on , triggering a drop in the value of shares of construction firms			0
@entity6 used a speech in @entity20 today to promise there is ' nothing more @entity23 than the dream of home - ownership ' as he sets out plans to prioritise new homes for local people the move to clampdown on landbanking - where firms hold on to undeveloped sites while its value increases - has proven unpopular			1
yesterday mr @entity6 said he would introduce rent controls if it won the election and ban private landlords from raising rents by more than the rate of inflation for the duration of new three - year contracts			2
it is thought the policies contributed to the fall in shares in leading housebuilding firms			0

' nervousness over the election is finally starting to filter into the @entity49			0
rent controls will affect the housing sector , ' said @entity63 , director of trading at @entity64			0
mr @entity6 , pictured checking his phone as he travels to @entity20 by train , wants to ban developers hoarding land which could be built on in a speech today , mr @entity6 said there is ' nothing more @entity23 than the dream of home - ownership ' as he sets out plans to prioritise new homes for local people			1
he warned that too often new homes are ' snapped up before local people get a look - in ' and promised to cut the cost of getting on to the property ladder			1
nine in 10 people buying their first home will benefit from the stamp duty break , saving them up to £ 5,000 , according to @entity2			1
in a speech in @entity20 , mr @entity6 said : ' there 's nothing more @entity23 than the dream of home - ownership , starting out in a place of your own			1
' but for so many young people today that dream is fading with more people than ever renting when they want to buy , new properties being snapped up before local people get a look - in , young families wondering if this country will ever work for them			1
' that is the condition of @entity23 today , a modern housing crisis which only a @entity2 government will tackle			2
' higher taxes will also be imposed on foreign buyers and up to half of new homes will be set aside for local residents			2
the plan would cost £ 225 million a year , which it says would be found through a series of tax - related measures			2
the battle for the support of @entity23 's aspiring homeowners has been electrified by a series of eye - catching policies from the main parties			2
@entity113 ordered a relaunch of @entity116 's @entity115 to buy policy , extending it to 1.3million families in housing association properties , while offering help to buy isas to people struggling to save for a deposit			2
the @entity124 have promised tenants the chance to buy a stake in their homes through a rent to buy scheme			0
under @entity2 's proposal , the planning laws would be changed to introduce a ' first call ' policy that would give first time buyers who have lived in an area for more than three years priority on up to half of local new homes			1
it will also introduce a ' local first ' policy that would stop properties being advertised overseas before they have been in the @entity23			0
mr @entity6 was greeted at the @entity142 in @entity20 by @entity143 , the @entity2 candidate for the @entity145 seat house prices are rising faster for first - time buyers than people already on the property ladder , according to @entity150 mr @entity6 said : ' it is simply too expensive for so many young people to buy a home today , saving up for the deposit , paying the fees and having enough left over for the stamp duty			1
so we 're going to act so we can transform the opportunities for young working people in our country			0
' for the first three years of the next @entity2 government , we will abolish stamp duty for all first time buyers of homes under £ 300,000			1
' chancellor @entity165 allowed a two - year holiday on stamp duty , which raised the threshold for first - time buyers to £ 250,000 , to expire in march 2012 , introducing a @entity169 in its place			1
mr @entity6 warns that too often new homes are ' snapped up before local people get a look - in ' and promised to cut the cost of getting on to the property ladder buyers currently pay nothing on the first £ 125,000 of a home 's value and are then charged on a sliding scale , starting with 2 per cent on the next £ 125,000 and 5 per cent on the following £ 675,000			1
@entity2 says it would fund the stamp duty plans by tackling tax avoidance by landlords , pointing to @entity185 figures that estimate it costs £ 550 million a year			1
it claims introducing a national register of landlords would mean that figure could be cut by 20 per cent , bringing in £ 100 million for @entity191 coffers			0
holding companies that buy properties for investors would be hit by increases to the annual tax on enveloped dwellings while buyers from outside the @entity199 would be hit by a hike in their stamp duty bills of at least 3 per cent			1
tax relief for landlords to cover the upkeep of furnished properties would also be reduced for rogue landlords that rent out sub-standard properties			0
a @entity210 spokesman said : ' this panicky , unfunded announcement is something @entity2 have tried before - and it failed			0
coming from the people who crashed the housing market and repeatedly raised stamp duty , this wo n't distract from @entity6 's inability to say what deals he will make with the @entity219 to prop him up in @entity221			1
' in contrast to @entity6 's gimmicks , because of our balanced economic plan , we 've been able to deliver lasting reforms - cutting stamp duty for 98 per cent of people who would have paid it			1
' higher borrowing and higher debt under an @entity219 - controlled @entity6 government would mean higher mortgage rates and fewer first - time buyers			1
' a @entity124 spokesman said : ' this is yet another unfunded promise from @entity2			0
just last week , the independent @entity236 told them they were n't being honest about their spending plans			0
it is clear they have learnt absolutely nothing			0
no - one should trust @entity2 to deliver this commitment because their sums simply do not add up			0
the @entity124 have been honest about our spending plans ; it 's time @entity2 and the @entity248 did the same			2
' only the @entity124 will really help people get on the housing ladder , by building the 300,000 homes needed to keep up with demand , helping young people afford the deposit for their rent , and helping people buy their homes over time through our rent to @entity261 plans			0

@entity6 says there 's ' nothing more @entity23 than dream of home - ownership '
stamp duty cut would save first - time buyers up to £ 5,000 on cost of buying
@entity2 would also ensure new homes go to local people with law change
