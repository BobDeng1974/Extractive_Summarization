@entity0 takes a look at 10 things we have learned from an entertaining weekend of @entity5 fixtures , as well as intriguing statistics from the @entity7			0
@entity8 says injuries to his strikers have made him take a cautious approach to the last few games wrapping up the title , but the defensive side of his team has stayed remarkably settled all season			1
the 0 - 0 draw at @entity18 was the 20th time in 33 @entity5 games that the @entity22 boss started with his favourite ‘ back seven ’ of @entity24 in goal , with @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 protected by @entity30 and @entity31			1
no other top - flight manager has come close to that level of consistency in selection			1
( from left ) @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity26 are three of @entity8 's settled back seven 2			1
@entity38 ’s first start in a @entity5 game since the 2 - 1 defeat by @entity22 in november was as frustrating as all the ones that went before			1
the @entity42 produced only one off - target shot at goal before getting hooked after 75 minutes , and defender @entity45 played twice as many accurate passes in the forward half as @entity38 ’s nine			1
his total distance run while he was on the pitch ( 4.4 miles ) was over a mile less than @entity51 striker @entity50 ( 5.5 ) who was substituted at the same time			0
@entity38 failed to impress during @entity53 's 0 - 0 @entity5 draw with @entity51 3			1
@entity54 , who demands a high - energy pressing game from his teams , must have been delighted that they collectively just outran @entity58 to earn their 2 - 2 draw at @entity60 ’s			1
spurs are currently second behind battling @entity62 in the @entity64 figures for the average total distance run per game			0
that ’s a huge contrast to last year under first @entity68 and then @entity69 , when they finished bottom of the same table			2
@entity54 points out instructions to his @entity75 players during the 2 - 2 draw with @entity58 4			2
@entity77 blamed a lack of sharpness for @entity81 ’s defeat at @entity82 , saying they lost three duels in a row before @entity86 ’ s fifth minute goal			1
it did n’t get any better after that			0
@entity90 won five of seven duels but otherwise @entity93 ( 5 of 8 ) and @entity94 ( 5 of 9 ) were the only other @entity81 players to win more than half of their individual battles			1
@entity86 slots past @entity98 after avoiding the challenges of @entity93 and @entity90 5			0
@entity100 was nicknamed the @entity101 by @entity103 fans and he ’s brought the same ‘ they shall not pass ’ mentality to @entity107 ’s defence			2
since signing for @entity109 on a loan deal at the end of january , the 30 - year - old has now played nine games and ended on the losing side only three times			2
@entity100 was @entity107 ’s best defender as they scrapped out the 1 - 0 win at @entity62 , which got them out of the relegation zone , making 14 clearances along the way			1
@entity100 ( right ) has played a major role in @entity107 's recent run of positive results 6			2
@entity123 took the chance to remind @entity126 boss @entity125 of what he can do after suffering a frustrating few months on the sidelines			0
the 27 - year - old winger , an automatic pick in the first half of the season , made his first start since early february in the 3 - 2 win at @entity135			1
against a @entity137 team without a recognised left back he was in his element – winning three free - kicks as he ran at the defence and covering more distance at sprint speed than any other player			2
@entity123 ( left ) showed @entity126 boss @entity125 what he 'd been missing upon his return from injury 7			0
getting @entity148 fit again will be a crucial factor for @entity150 as @entity151 fights to keep his side out of the relegation zone through a tough set of remaining fixtures			2
the 2 - 0 win at @entity157 was the 26 - year - old @entity160 international ’s first 90 - minute appearance since dislocating his shoulder at @entity162 in january			1
he was a key factor in keeping in - form @entity165 quiet and also composed on the ball giving it away only five times in 90 minutes and winning it back on all but one of those occasions			0
@entity148 ( centre ) battles for the ball with @entity157 forward @entity165 on saturday 8			0
@entity175 need to find more goals from the rest of their team if they are to cash in on the prolific form of front men @entity181 and @entity183			0
@entity183 got his 20th of the campaign in the 2 - 2 draw at @entity187 while @entity181 reached 19 – and if he gets another against @entity190 next weekend @entity189 ’s side will join @entity191 as the only @entity193 clubs with two strikers who have got 20 or more league goals			1
the combination of @entity197 ( 21 ) and @entity198 ( 20 ) has taken the @entity199 into the @entity5 because the rest of the side have weighed in with enough to make it 90 in total			0
@entity175 , 13 points outside the play - off places , have scored a total of 63			0
@entity183 celebrates his 31st - minute striker during @entity175 's 2 - 2 draw with @entity187 9			1
@entity209 still need a point at @entity211 on the final day to be certain of staying in @entity212 , but either way it ’s likely they will immediately be looking for their 10th manager in as many years			1
temporary boss @entity216 turned on his team after the 3 - 1 home defeat by @entity219 , accusing some of ' finding it difficult to play '			2
the former @entity222 and @entity223 boss has a contract only until the end of next sunday ’s game and has already told friends he plans to be back at his home in the @entity229 the next day			0
@entity209 boss @entity216 ( left ) turned on his team after the 3 - 1 home defeat by @entity219 on saturday 10			2
@entity232 stepped in to rescue the career of @entity234 when he was let go by @entity103 in 2012 , after starting just five @entity5 games in four years following his £ 1.25million move from @entity157			0
the former @entity238 under 21 international midfielder could n’t find another club – and had to play for nothing at first to earn a contract			0
three years later he ’s close to repaying them by earning promotion			0
he scored one and made the other in the 2 - 0 win over @entity247 which means a last - day victory against already - relegated @entity249 could yet pinch third place from @entity251 .			0

@entity8 's defensive set - up has remained settled all season
@entity22 manager has relied on @entity27 , @entity257
@entity38 could *n't* make the most his latest @entity53 start
