@entity0 being unmasked as the killer of his half - sister @entity2 in @entity3 was not the only surprising plot twist in the last seven days			1
over in west @entity5 , @entity6 , the owner of @entity8 , confirmed the equally remarkable news that the club and manager @entity10 would part company in the summer			1
and if fans of the @entity17 soap were left disappointed that after 10 months of twists and turns an 11 - year - old was revealed as the killer , then the @entity14 faithful were left equally confused that the man who led them to promotion last season and is in the process of guiding them to their best season in 70 years is now set to depart			1
@entity10 celebrates after @entity29 's strike settled the tie and kept them in the hunt for the play - offs it took less than a minute for the fans on the @entity36 to start chanting @entity10 ’s name during saturday ’s excellent win			1
but anyone thinking that was a dig aimed at the owner were proved wrong as those same fans started singing ‘ there ’s only one @entity6 ’ straight after			2
@entity6 , 43 , invested in the club when they faced going out of business and by funding the new ground half a mile down the road has secured @entity8 ’s long - term future			1
@entity49 celebrates after opening the scoring for @entity8 in their clash with @entity52 many see @entity6 ’s decision to part with @entity10 and adopt a more continental style of management as a gamble			1
but that is exactly what @entity6 is			2
a physics graduate from @entity63 , he became a financial trader before moving on to become one of the world ’s leading gamblers			2
he set up @entity68 , a company which provides statistical and qualitative research to its clients in order for them to bet on football matches			2
the firm has developed a sophisticated probability model which takes into account theories , trends and anomalies to help get the best results			0
@entity6 , the owner of @entity8 , has had a clash of philosophy with @entity10 since taking over @entity8 in 2012 , @entity6 has shunned publicity and rarely gives interviews			1
but he did talk to @entity85 for his 2013 book on football scouting called @entity88			0
‘ if i am looking at a striker i absolutely do not care about his goalscoring record , ’ @entity6 told @entity85			0
‘ for me , the only thing that is interesting is how the team do collectively , offensively and defensively , within the context of an individual ’s performance			0
‘ i always thought @entity96 gave his team an amazing outlet			0
the team would be under pressure			0
you knew if you hoofed it in his general direction there ’d be a high chance the ball would stick , and he ’d win a foul			0
that ’s the great defensive service @entity96 is offering			0
@entity10 applauds the home @entity14 crowd having defeated promotion rivals @entity52 ‘ the fact a front player can hold the ball up means you are not going to concede another attack			1
‘ we ’re working towards a new football model , we ’re pretty far away			0
it is a computational issue			0
’ this approach does not fit well with @entity10 ’s philosophy			1
after saturday ’s win the manager said : ‘ the emphasis is going slightly more to that mathematical model allied with the traditional scouting methods			1
‘ that is what the club have chosen and i have to respect that			0
but if i disagree with something now then i would rather be honest rather than leave in six months and look back with regret			2
’ for a club like @entity8 the way to success is either to do what everyone else is doing and try and do it better			1
or do things differently and try and get an edge			0
the owner accepts that getting rid of @entity10 and going down this new route is a risk			1
but what else would you expect ? grapple of the week @entity144 might swap the @entity145 for the @entity146 after his weekend display			0
@entity148 ’s left back was fouled by @entity150 ’s @entity149 — and threw him to the ground with a wrestling move			0
@entity144 saw red , @entity149 a yellow			0
but at least the 10 men of @entity148 won the game 2 - 0			2
@entity148 's @entity144 does a @entity146 body slam on @entity150 's @entity149 @entity158 ’s @entity157 ... @entity160 ’ 3 - 0 win over @entity161 brought an end to @entity164 ’s second spell at @entity165			1
back - to - back defeats have left @entity161 down in 15th in @entity167 and he walked away with chairman @entity169 describing him as ‘ one of the finest managers in our club ’s history ’			2
striker @entity175 , 37 , scored a 90th - minute winner for @entity177 as they beat @entity179 3 - 2 , 11 years and nine months after he scored his final goal for the original @entity177 in 2003			1
@entity164 has ended his second spell as @entity161 manager with @entity161 15th in @entity167			2

@entity8 defeated promotion rivals 3 - 1 at @entity14 on saturday
manager @entity10 is set to leave @entity8 in the summer
