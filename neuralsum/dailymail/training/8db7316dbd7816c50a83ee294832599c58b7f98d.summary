@entity0 led @entity2 's charge against his former club @entity3 at the top of the table after netting the winning goal in the reigning champion 's 1 - 0 defeat of @entity9			1
despite a show of support from the stands , @entity12 's dismal run continued - the @entity10 have not won a @entity17 game since upsetting @entity18 in september and remain bottom of the table			1
@entity22 's @entity21 was at the @entity23 to run the rule over both sets of teams ... @entity0 is congratulated by his team - mates after opening the scoring for @entity2 a section of @entity9 fans show their support for their under - fire manager @entity12 @entity33 ( centre ) was the reigning champion 's outstanding player at the @entity23 @entity9 ( 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 ) @entity36 6.5 – given the task of filling the gloves of injured @entity39 and responded well , good on crosses and showed good judgement to keep out an attempted lob by @entity43			1
@entity44 5.5 – stuck to his guns but found it difficult to keep up with the pace at which the likes of @entity43 and @entity49 would move the ball			0
lucky not to be booked early with a late challenge @entity52 5.5 – had built himself up to face the powerhouse @entity55 , instead came up against the quicksilver @entity57 after the @entity58 was injured in the warm - up			2
stand - in keeper @entity36 ( centre ) watches as the ball passes him for @entity2 's opening goal @entity64 6 – had a great battle with @entity33 and gave as good as he got			1
distribution was n't the best but he did what he needed to , defend , apart from that one moment when @entity0 got clear @entity70 6.5 – not surprisingly was n't overawed by the occasion , having played big @entity73 games for @entity74			2
protected the @entity9 back - four and came so close to scoring with a free - kick @entity76 6 – the @entity77 has pace to burn which is why @entity12 wanted him to hug the touchline and run			1
run he did and impressively so but nothing came from it			0
@entity84 veteran @entity70 ( right ) fights an aerial duel with @entity33 @entity86 5.5 – found it hard to get to grips of central midfield with @entity2 's powerhouses @entity33 and @entity91			1
@entity9 need to get him creating for the rest of the season @entity95 5.5 – like @entity86 , found it hard to get a foothold in midfield and was n't at his best from the rare set piece opportunities that went the way of the home side @entity102 6.5 – you could see why manager @entity12 wanted him to exploit his pace			2
showed the defenders a clean pair of heels on more than one occasion but did n't utilise it liecester forward @entity76 shields the ball from @entity0 as the hosts battle to end their slump @entity112 6 – scored a great goal in the famous 5 - 3 win against @entity18 and should have scored after sprinting past @entity115			1
but he did n't convert and was later taken off			0
substitutions : @entity118 ( for @entity119 64 ) 5.5 – did n't see enough of the ball to make an impact @entity123 ( for @entity112 73 ) 5.5 – not made a great impact in his loan spell from @entity18 @entity126 ( for @entity128 79 ) unused subs : @entity129 ( @entity130 ) , @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 manager : @entity12 – 6.5 foxes striker @entity112 ( centre ) looks to get a shot away under pressure from @entity115 @entity2 @entity138 6 – seems to have grown in confidence this season with a new long - term deal on the table			1
his presence alone calmed a shaky defence though he was nearly caught out by @entity70 's curler @entity147 6 – replaced @entity148 and had some uncomortable moments as @entity119 hit his strides			0
but @entity151 will be happy how the former @entity153 right - back stuck to his task @entity155 6.5 – looked bulky and not a surprise maybe when he pulled up with a hamstring on his return from a calf injury			0
but while on the pitch , you ca n't underestimate his influence on the team , when @entity9 got in behind the defence early on , he was the one to cover and make the key interceptions to keep the game at 0 - 0 , @entity167 no 1 @entity138 ( left ) dives to keep out a free - kick from @entity70 @entity115 6 – his strength is his strength , the way he out - muscled @entity112 in front of goal hinted at a £ 32m defender			1
unforunately , there are other flaws and he was turned more than once			0
while his communication with keeper @entity138 needs improvement			0
@entity178 6 – the injury to @entity180 has given @entity178 a sustained run in the team and it has helped his consistency			0
as probably @entity2 's quickest defender , this was his kind of game @entity33 7 – missed the @entity188 game through suspension and the freshness helped him become one of the key players			1
tested @entity36 early on with a stinging shot and a menace all over the pitch			0
an attacking threat without deserting his defensive station - although unfortunate that his worst touch , a wayward shot , struck a supporter			0
@entity203 playmaker is unfortunate with a lob after retuirning to the starting line - up after a spell out injured @entity91 6.5 – this was the type of game @entity151 signed him for , a tricky away match at a highly - motivated team at the bottom			2
@entity91 got stuck in as you 'd expect but he 'll have to watch the number of free - kicks he gives away in important areas			0
@entity49 6.5 – in a rich vein of form at the moment and timing his passes to perfection			0
his slide - rule cross for @entity0 was an invitation for the former @entity167 midfielder to tap in			1
@entity0 6.5 - entrusted with the pivotal no 10 role at the age of 36			2
had spells where he did little , but nobody else could have found space in the six - yard box like him to score the opener @entity49 ( left ) continued his impressive recent run of form with an influential midfield performance @entity235 6 – the little @entity203 wizard was welcomed back for the first time since a knee injuring and found his rhythm of passing almost immediately			2
narrowly misjudged an attempted lob over @entity36 @entity57 5.5 – called up just before kick off when @entity55 was injured in the warm up			0
at 18 he 's a talent but the truth is this level is just too intense and competitive for him right now substitutes : @entity247 ( for @entity0 59 ) 6.5 – becoming one of @entity151 's heroes this season			2
slotted in on the left - hand side of midfield for this game and got in some dangerous crosses lampard wheels away to celebrate his first - half goal after being set up by @entity49 @entity258 ( for @entity259 ) 5.5 – @entity2 were more interested in defending for the final 11 minutes @entity260 ( for @entity261 77 ) manager : @entity263 7 referee : @entity265 6.5 @entity266 : @entity33 attendance : 31,643			1

@entity2 defeated @entity9 1 - 0 in their @entity17 clash
@entity0 opened scoring to keep pressure on former club @entity3
@entity33 was named man of the match after a *balanced* performance
