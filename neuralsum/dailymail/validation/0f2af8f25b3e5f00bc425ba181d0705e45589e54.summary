motorists face a new speed camera blitz and £ 100 fines as 20mph limits are imposed on some of @entity5 ’s busiest roads motorists face a new speed camera blitz and £ 100 fines as 20mph limits are imposed on some of @entity5 ’s busiest roads			1
until now , lower speed limits have been restricted to smaller roads in residential areas or near schools			1
but in a major policy shift , 20mph limits are to be introduced on major arterial roads – and policed by the latest digital speed cameras			1
campaigners say it is the start of a radical new nationwide attempt to slow traffic down			1
@entity21 mayor @entity20 yesterday revealed that eight pilot schemes will be run on ‘ @entity23 ’ – the main arterial roads that carry a third of the capital ’s traffic			1
@entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 and many other towns and cities say they also intend to introduce the new limits			0
motorists caught breaking the 20mph limit face a minimum £ 100 fine and three points on their driving licence			1
the @entity41 says the new limits are being driven more by ‘ dogma ’ than road safety			1
a spokesman said : ‘ these 20mph zones are popping up like spring daffodils			0
‘ there is a lot of fear among drivers that , with 20mph being a relatively unfamiliar speed , widespread speed camera use will make them look more at their speedometers than at what is happening on populated streets in front of them			1
’ if the 18 - month trials in @entity21 are judged a success , the 20mph limits will be made permanent and imposed on 30 miles of key ‘ @entity23 ’ considered by transport bosses to be ‘ more local road than motorway ’			2
some 175 miles of residential streets , about a quarter of the capital ’s roads , already have 20mph limits			2
the trend is spreading across @entity5			0
following a pilot scheme , @entity28 has spent more than £ 2.3million installing 20mph signs			2
@entity29 is consulting on half the city being similarly covered , and 6,000 @entity31 residents have signed a petition against a £ 2.2million scheme to make up to 80 per cent of the @entity76 capital a 20mph zone			2
@entity78 , of @entity79 – a charity campaigning for healthier and cheaper transport – said of the @entity21 announcement : ‘ this is a significant step up – and the next step on the road for more 20mph limits			0
mayor of london @entity20 , pictured , wants to introduce new 20mph speed limits across the city @entity90 in @entity91 , pictured , is also going to be hit by a 20mph limit as part of the 18 - month trial ‘ it ’s pioneering			1
for the first time 20mph limits are being imposed on main arterial roads – not just quiet residential roads where there is little traffic			1
we expect other cities to follow @entity21 ’s lead			0
’ but the @entity41 says while 20mph limits have their place , they should not be introduced where they will increase traffic jams and pollution – and where residents want them , not imposed in a ‘ blanket ’ fashion			1
a blanket rollout of 20mph zones in towns and cities will result in millions of pounds in fines pouring into @entity120 coffers , the @entity41 warned last night			2
motorists caught on speed cameras going over 20mph will be fined a minimum of £ 100 , and get three points on their licence			1
the money goes to the @entity120			0
until 2007 , @entity127 kept all the cash they raised from fines , often using it to buy more cameras to generate more money			0
this led to motorists complaining that the cameras were being used as ‘ cash cow ’ revenue - raisers			0
to defuse the controversy , the system was scrapped and all fines are paid directly to the @entity120 , which in turn returns the cash as a general road safety grant to pay for cameras and ‘ other measures ’			0
the @entity41 says it does not oppose 20mph limits where appropriate and where they are supported by residents , but it fears many councils and campaign groups are being driven by ‘ an inherent or institutional prejudice against the motor car ’			1
a spokesman said : ‘ the blanket rollout of so many 20mph limits and zones is going to push lots of money into @entity120 coffers and give them a cash windfall			0
worried drivers may feel well and truly fleeced if they are caught on camera and fined for being marginally over the speed limit			2
’ other councils which have implemented or are committed to adopting new 20mph limits include @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity28 , @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity31 , @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity179 , @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity184 , @entity185 , @entity186 , @entity187 , together with numerous @entity21 boroughs			0
under the new @entity21 scheme , the first road to convert to 20mph next month will be @entity191 in @entity192 , linking into plans for @entity194 and @entity195 to become 20mph boroughs			0
@entity197 said : ‘ safety cameras across @entity21 are being upgraded to new digital cameras which will have the capability to help police enforce 20mph speed limits ’ , adding that it hoped the new limits will reduce the number of pedestrians , cyclists and motorcyclists killed or seriously injured by 40 per cent by 2020			1
@entity208 , founder of the ‘ @entity210 ’ campaign group , said : ‘ the current 30mph national limit is being rejected as “ unfit for purpose ” for communities so we ’re setting out a series of government actions required for a planned transition to a @entity5 default urban limit of 20mph by 2020			0
’ a @entity221 spokesman said : ‘ research shows 20mph zones can save lives and this government has made it easier for councils to introduce them			0
‘ it is for local authorities to set speed limits and for the police to decide how best to enforce them			2
’ the spokesman added : ‘ we are undertaking a three - year research project to better understand the effect of 20mph zones and their impact on local communities			0

speed limits on major arterial roads to be lowered in major policy shift
motorists caught breaking 20mph limit will face minimum fines of £ 100
