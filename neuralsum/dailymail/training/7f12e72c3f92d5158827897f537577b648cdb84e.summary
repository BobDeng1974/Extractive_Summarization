@entity0 : @entity1 faked his father 's signature to gain more than £ 30,000 a son forged his dead father ’s signature to make himself the sole heir in his will , cheating five charities and his own brother out of more than £ 30,000			1
solicitors raised the alarm when the fake signature by @entity1 , from @entity13 , @entity14 , bore no resemblance to his father @entity16			1
but the 51 - year - old was spared jail after a court heard he was a full - time carer for his disabled wife			0
@entity22 heard @entity1 was made the joint executor of his father 's will in may 2008 together with a firm of solicitors in @entity28			1
when @entity16 died aged 75 in april last year , the solicitors asked @entity1 if @entity16 's most recent will , made in 2010 , was the correct version			1
instead of telling them the truth , @entity1 sent back an ' updated ' will making him the sole beneficiary of the £ 49,000 estate			1
he was in fact supposed to receive £ 11,000 , with his brother @entity37 left an equal share			1
four charities - the @entity39 , @entity40 in @entity41 , @entity43 ’s and the @entity42 - were also due to receive £ 5,800 each , with pet charity @entity45 owed another £ 2,500			2
solicitors raised suspicions about the will 's authenticity after they noticed the signature bore no resemblance to a previous one they had from @entity16			1
@entity1 handed himself in to police two days later and admitted to forging the will and falsely receiving the £ 49,000			2
he pleaded guilty to forgery , fraud and theft when he appeared at @entity22 yesterday			2
cheated : @entity40 in @entity41 , pictured , was one charity due to receive almost £ 5,800 the court heard @entity1 was deeply sorry - telling his barrister ' if they take me out and hang me that is not enough ' - and had paid the solicitors £ 33,029 of the money he took			2
he still owes £ 3,158 , but told the court he was not in a position to pay it back			0
@entity66 , defending , said @entity1 was a full - time carer for his disabled wife and had been worried a reassessment would lead to the loss of her benefits			0
he said he was also concerned about finding money to help his daughter put a deposit on a house			0
mr @entity66 added : ' this is a man who , of his own volition , walked into a police station at a time when police were not even aware of any wrongdoing on his part			0
' @entity1 was spared jail when judge @entity85 handed him a 12 - month prison sentence suspended for two years			0
he was also ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work			0
walking free : @entity1 was spared jail at @entity22 , pictured			0

@entity1 , 51 , was an executor when his father @entity16 died last year
solicitors wrote to him to check his father 's 2010 will was the most recent
so @entity1 , from @entity13 , @entity14 , forged and sent in an ' updated ' will
new *document* cut out brother @entity37 and five charities including @entity45
but the signature bore no resemblance at all to his father 's
@entity1 , who was actually left £ 11,000 , admitted forgery , fraud and theft
