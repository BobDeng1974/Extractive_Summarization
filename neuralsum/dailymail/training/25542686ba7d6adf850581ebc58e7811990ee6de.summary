an @entity1 company has created a wristband that uses a form of shock therapy to encourage the development of good habits			1
the product is branded as a ' personal coach on your wrist ' and can even be used to help stop overeating			1
@entity14 is worn as a wristband and can be activated manually or automatically , according to @entity16			2
the idea behind the shocking invention is that the two milliampere shock will condition wearers to develop and stick to good habits by associating the bad habits with the uncomfortable yet effective shock			1
' by adding a shock while you eat , you train your lizard brain to associate the act of eating ( or the type of food ) with the shock — and it can effectively limit the drive for mindless eating that you normally have , ' @entity32 told @entity55			2
behavior : the band locks together on the wrist , allowing it to give a small shock to the wearer to ' reinforce ' their behavior journalist @entity64 of @entity55 put the wristband to the test during the year 's most gluttonous of holidays : @entity68			1
@entity64 strapped on the wristband before @entity68 dinner and , though @entity32 reportedly assured @entity64 the shock was not painful , the journalist begged to differ			1
' it felt like someone was plucking out my arm hair with a pair of pincers , ' @entity64 wrote			0
@entity64 wrote of the shock ' it makes you ask yourself , wait , why am i hungry again ? ' @entity64 did not overeat that @entity68 day , according to the dot , but the journalist was not sure if that was a result of the @entity8			1
however , @entity64 wrote that the @entity8 may undoubtedly work as a back - up plan to sheer willpower			1
@entity64 remains wary of shock therapy , according to the dot , but admitted that the wristband was at least somewhat effective because ' i was more than able to button each button of my pants			1
' the @entity16 reports that the wristband is expected to go on sale next year for $ 244			2
according to the @entity8 website , the wristband helps to transform wearers and promotes change			1
' i like to say that for the last 1,000 years , we ’ve tamed environment , but we have n’t tamed ourselves , @entity32 said			0
the wristband acts as a helping agent in the ' taming			2
' ' ... change is n't impossible , ' the website states			0
' choose your daily action , and @entity8 will hold you accountable , ensuring lasting success			2
' ' it 's not about the shock as much as it is about training your brain to do the things you say you 're going to do , ' @entity32 told @entity115			2
