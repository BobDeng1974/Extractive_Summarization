by @entity0 published : 12:27 est , 23 april 2013 updated : 05:08 est , 24 april 2013 @entity2 @entity1 has been criticised for declaring speed limits should be abolished and drivers should be able to go ' flat out ' on some roads a police and crime commissioner has apologised today after saying speed limits on motorways and main roads should be scrapped and skilled drivers allowed to drive as fast they like / @entity1 , who is paid a salary of £ 70,000 as the independent @entity2 for @entity14 , was criticised after saying : ‘ we ought to drive to road conditions rather than set limits			1
‘ the problem is there ’s so many signs			0
you are driving along and you get mesmerised by them and you get situations where you get a 50 [ limit ] , to 40 , to 30 and it goes to 20 and back up again			0
’ ‘ if we ’re going to do something about speed and villages , we ought to just take all the signs down and say all villages are 30mph , or whatever it ’s going to be , and you drive on roads – like they do in @entity33 and @entity34 – as road conditions say			1
’ he added : ‘ people say if people are going fast they will cause trouble , but a lot of people , if [ the limit ] was 70mph , would go faster anyway			2
’ when asked at what speed a driver could safely travel on an open road in the early morning , he said : ‘ if you have got someone who ’s a @entity46 racing driver , well , you can go flat out			1
if he was a racing driver and really good and had tremendous reflexes , probably as fast as the car will go			1
’ however , @entity49 , chief executive of the @entity50 , said : ‘ twenty - four per cent of road deaths are caused by inappropriate speed			2
' we need to protect innocent road users from people who think that they can drive faster , like racing drivers , on the highway			1
’ @entity59 , head of road safety at the @entity61 , added : ‘ abolishing speed limits is a daft idea			2
’ speaking after the interview , mr @entity1 , who was chairman of the @entity66 for six years before his election last november , was unrepentant			1
he said : ‘ i do agree with those who believe we should revisit the upper speed limit of 70mph on our motorways and modern roads which have been built , along with vehicles , with safety in mind			0
mr @entity1 has said he agrees with those ' who believe we should revisit the current upper speed limit of 70mph on our motorways ' and modern roads ‘ whilst this may be unpopular in some quarters , research would point to whether this could be universally acceptable			1
my comments were designed to provoke the debate			0
’ however , mr @entity1 has today apologised for his remarks			1
he said : ‘ with hindsight , my message around the clutter of associated signage has been lost in my flippant comments about speeding			0
‘ i fully acknowledge that speed is regarded as a contributory factor in determining the outcome of collisions			0
‘ my comments were not meant to be offensive			2
i have been out with @entity96 , and i have lost a close personal friend in a collision , and therefore understand the misery and heartbreak that follow loss of life and serious injury on our roads			0
‘ i am supporting the @entity106 ( with @entity107 ) and this has contributed to a significant reduction in road deaths and serious injury casualties			0
’ earlier this year , the @entity111 published guidelines for local authorities to give them more flexibility in setting speed limits on local roads .			0

@entity2 @entity1 said people should drive to road conditions
he said how fast people should be allowed to drive depended on the driver
he said : ' if you *'ve* got a @entity46 racing driver , well you can go flat out '
guild of @entity128 has described his comments as ' nonsense '
mr @entity1 today apologised and said comments not meant to be ' offensive '
