police have launched an investigation into the loss of @entity10 's ring from the @entity11 in february			1
his relatives have accepted that they are ' not going to get it back ' - but say they are adamant that the same horror must never be allowed to happen to anyone else			0
theft : @entity10 , pictured , apparently had his wedding ring removed from his finger after his death mr @entity10 died aged 78 on february 24 , after a two - week spell in hospital following a fall at his home in the @entity26 neighbourhood of @entity27			1
his daughters tried to remove his wedding ring at the time , but were unable to do so because his hands were so swollen			1
however , when an undertaker went to the hospital to pick up mr @entity10 's body , the ring had gone missing			1
the family also claims that around Â£ 5 in cash vanished from the locker besides the pensioner 's hospital bed			2
' the ring was stuck on his finger because his fingers were swollen , ' his daughter @entity39 said			2
' we managed to get another ring off , but not that one			2
' when i arranged the funeral they asked if he still had any jewellery on him and i said about the ring on his wedding finger			1
she told me that when he was brought back they would be in touch for us to pick them up straight away because they did n't like to keep anything like that			0
' they rang me on march 8 and told me they had @entity62 there but that he did n't have the ring on his finger			0
my jaw just dropped and i could n't actually speak			0
' probe : officials at the @entity11 are currently investigating the upsetting incident mrs @entity39 's husband @entity68 said that after mr @entity10 died , a nurse put some tape around the ring to stop it slipping off his finger			1
he added : ' we are not worried about the cost of the ring - we know we are not going to get it back because it has probably been melted down now , we are more concerned about it happening to other people			0
