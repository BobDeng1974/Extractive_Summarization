this is the dramatic moment a self - styled ' paedophile hunter ' confronted a potential sex attacker who he had lured to a house by posing as a child online			1
@entity6 , who is based in @entity7 , @entity8 , works with his team to entrap internet perverts - including soldiers , teachers and solicitors - by posing as underage boys and girls			1
in this dramatic clip , undercover vigilantes from @entity6 's team were seen poised for action with a camera while they waited for one of the suspects			1
when the man walked in , one of the vigilantes asked the suspect to explain himself , before starting to click away with his camera in a bid to expose him			2
the two men shouted for him to stop , promising him the information would be handed to the police			0
one of the men was then heard saying : ' sir , i suggest you stop and talk , your information is going to be handed to the police '			0
the clip sets the tone for the remainder of the @entity34 , a one - hour film to be shown tomorrow night on @entity61			1
it follows the 31 - year - old and his team as they track down suspects through the internet and dating apps			1
@entity6 told the documentary each of the team has a ' defined role '			2
@entity72 , who features heavily in the documentary , is the ' tech guy ' , responsible for ensuring the videos are filmed and edited properly			0
but the man - who was not seen on camera - ran from the property when he realised he could be exposed the men were heard shouting : ' sir , i suggest you stop and talk , your information is going to be handed to the police , ' while they chased him with a shaky , hand - held video the vigilantes usually pose as boys or girls in their early teens			1
once they are sent explicit messages and videos by the men , the team lure them to a house to meet up			2
there , they are filmed with handheld cameras and mobile phones and told to explain themselves			0
the messages and footage are handed to police			0
so far , @entity6 has filmed confrontations with dozens of men including soldiers , teachers and solicitors and seen his evidence help in 10 convictions			1
during the documentary , the team was also filmed setting up a trap to catch the suspected offender			1
one of the team was filmed following a black taxi , while speaking on the phone to two of his colleagues			0
meanwhile , those two vigilantes were filmed nervously peering through the blinds while they waited for the arrival of a taxi at a nearby home			0
footage from the documentary shows members of the team poised for action before one of their stings while one of the team followed the suspect who is travelling to the house in a taxi , others waited inside , nervously peering through the blinds until he arrives they are filmed waiting in a house where they stand with handheld cameras and mobile phones , reading to confront the alleged paedophile when one shouted ' taxi 's here ' , the pair - one equipped with a camera - put themselves into position and waited to confront the man when he arrived at the front door			1
@entity6 's methods have been both praised and criticised			2
@entity6 's methods came under fire last year after one man who he confronted , 45 - year - old @entity152 , took his own life			1
@entity157 ( pictured ) said online vigilantes were ' shooting fish in a barrel ' by using covert stings but @entity157 , the former head of the @entity162 ( @entity162 ) , said the former drug addict provided a lesson in how people could trap paedophiles with ' very little training '			1
he said : ' some people with very little training are proving just how easy it is to go out there and catch individuals			0
' they are able to go online with little or no training and very quickly they ’re shooting fish in a barrel			0
' the fact of the matter is this , that needs to be done by law enforcement and whilst i do n’t see any justification in reality for vigilantes doing what they do i think it provides the evidence for the government , if it ’s needed , that actually this works			0
' he added he understood the ' frustration ' that drove the self - styled investigative journalist , who lives in the @entity194 area and says he witnessed abuse as a child , to target suspected predators			1
but mr @entity157 insisted the vigilante 's actions created ' a risk ' to himself and other people , and were not the most appropriate way forward			2
but there have been controversies , particularly in the case of mr @entity152			0
the 45 - year - old hanged himself last year after being questioned by police after he was confronted by @entity6 , and footage of the encounter was uploaded to the internet			1
@entity211 later said they would have sought to charge mr @entity152 in connection with the incident , in which he arranged to meet someone he thought was a 12 - year - old girl			1
mr @entity152 ’ partner , who was also interviewed for the @entity61 documentary , said she ' may agree ' with the vigilante going online to gather evidence , but said publishing the videos was ' what probably tipped him over the edge '			2
@entity6 had insisted on keeping his face secret for fear of reprisals , but went public after saying he had ' always wanted to be on @entity61 '			2
@entity6 , pictured , tells the documentary that he carries out his work with the help of his team who all have ' dedicated roles ' effect : @entity152 , pictured , hanged himself after he was confronted by @entity6 last year controversial : self - styled paedophile catchers like @entity6 ( pictured ) show police should invest more in online stings , according to @entity237 's former child protection chief @entity157 website : until now the 31 - year - old former drug addict had hidden his face on his website ( pictured ) he told the film 's bafta - winning director @entity242 : ' we set the profile			1
it ’s like a rope and if they choose to put the rope around their neck and hang themselves that ’s their choice			0
' we ’ve not pushed them			0
' the film also features interviews with police and legal experts who tackle child exploitation , who talk about the dangers for vigilantes , the people they target and their families			2
there is also the risk that amateur investigations could compromise police probes , the experts say			0
one barrister who regularly deals with child exploitation cases , @entity271 , added there were risks of copycat vigilantes springing up in response			0
the @entity34 will be screened on wednesday , october 1 at 10pm on @entity61 .			0
