by @entity1 reporter published : 04:13 est , 4 july 2012 updated : 08:10 est , 5 july 2012 a girl of two escaped death by a millimetre when she fell on to a pencil which lodged in her brain			1
a startling x-ray shows the pencil penetrating @entity10 ’s right eye and continuing one - and - a - half inches inside her head			1
neurosurgeons operated for four hours to save her life , removing a section of her skull to take the pencil out			1
they said that , astonishingly , the point of the pencil had not gone into her eyeball but had skirted the top of it , passing between the eyeball and the socket			1
just a fraction further and it could have proved fatal			0
remarkably , she emerged unscathed with no brain damage and no ill effects on her eyesight			2
@entity10 had been drawing in her bedroom and was running to show the pictures to her parents @entity52 and @entity33 when she tripped over a stairgate and the pencil she was holding went into her brain			1
mr @entity56 , 34 , a model maker , said : ‘ a broken bone would be bad enough , but something happening to the eye , head or brain is one of the worst things that could possibly go wrong			2
‘ fortunately my wife , who is a nursery nurse , kept a level head and realised not to try to get the pencil out			0
’ lodged : a scan showing the pencil lodged in @entity10 's brain after she tripped and fell on to it an ambulance took @entity10 from her home in @entity74 , @entity75 , to the city ’s @entity76			1
after a scan showed the seriousness of the injury it was decided to transfer her to the specialist neurosurgeons at @entity82 near @entity83			0
all better : @entity10 with her parents @entity52 and @entity33			2
the toddler had to spend three weeks in hospital with her family at her bedside consultant neurosurgeon @entity89 , who operated on @entity10 , said : ‘ the pencil was within a millimetre of hitting a big blood vessel in the brain			1
she was incredibly lucky as she came out fortunately with no major bleeding			0
‘ it just skirted the top of the eye and that it did n’t damage the eyeball itself was very fortunate			2
she was very lucky not to have suffered any permanent damage			0
’ mr @entity89 said he had seen this type of injury about three times in 16 years as a consultant neurosurgeon			0
‘ i have also known of a case , which i did not deal with myself , that was fatal , ’ he said			0
‘ and another , which was not fatal but caused a lot of damage because it hit the blood vessel			0
’ he said that as well as removing part of @entity10 ’s skull , it was also necessary to ensure no flecks from the pencil had remained inside the brain by using an antibiotic wash			1
@entity10 ’s father said : ‘ they then put her skull back together with plastic plates and screws which will biodegrade			1
’ after the operation @entity10 spent three weeks in @entity82 with her family around her and was allowed home on april 4			1
she had to take anti-seizure drugs as a precaution but has been fine			0
mr @entity56 , who has signed up for a first aid course since the accident , is to take part in a sponsored cycle ride to raise money for more toys for @entity134 ’s children ’s unit			0
‘ i ca n’t thank the neurosurgeons enough for what they did and this is a way of giving a little bit back , ’ he said			0
‘ the toys and games provided by the play team at @entity134 provided a distraction for @entity10 on a daily basis for those three and a half weeks			2
that kept her sane and therefore kept us sane			0
’ lucky : consultant neurosurgeon @entity89 , who operated on @entity10 , said she was ' incredibly lucky ' lucky escape : the pencil was within a millimetre of hitting a big blood vessel in the brain			1
