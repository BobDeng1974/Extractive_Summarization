by @entity0 for @entity1 a cupboard has been put on the market for £ 7,500 as @entity5 's housing market reached a new ridiculous peak today			1
the estate agent selling the 5ft by 12ft room says it is perfect for someone looking for more storage at a price he believes will save the buyer money			1
the walk - in cupboard can only be bought by a resident already living in the @entity17 , which sits on the @entity18 in west @entity5			1
it continues : ' this baggage store is perfect for those who are seeking some additional space			2
' the storage cupboard is a good size , perfect for a pushchair or pieces of furniture '			2
much like investors who are selling garages in prime spots for up to £ 500,000 others are buying up space to cash in on those desperate for storage			1
sales negotiator @entity53 from @entity54 told the @entity55 : ' people use them as airing cupboards , or to store suitcases or bicycles or memorabilia – things like photographs which they do n’t want to throw away but which they do n’t have room for at home			2
' if they have a cupboard they know their things are safe and secure and close by			0
everybody loves a bit of extra storage			0
' the cupboard symbolises the struggle for most londoners who are unable to afford a property , if at all			0
symbolic : the cupboard is only available to people already living in the estate but represents how people are making money from the lack of space most @entity23 have in @entity5 , the average price is now £ 499,000 – putting it on the brink of a landmark £ 500,000			1
@entity87 also shows that first - time buyers must find an average of £ 204,000 – a 12 per cent rise and the highest annual increase for nearly four years			0
young home - seekers on a typical full - time salary of £ 21,200 would now need a mortgage of nine times their income with a five per cent deposit			0
even if they do get on the property ladder , storage is likely to be at a minimum in most homes			0
but agents maintain that buying a cupboard offers good value because many pay in excess of £ 100 a month for storage with nothing to show for it			0
mr @entity53 said : ' if you add up what you could spend on storage compared to buying a cupboard space you might be surprised ' .			1

walk - in room measures 5ft by 12ft and is being sold as storage
space in @entity17 , west @entity5 , can only be bought by residents on estate
agent says buyer will save money because of high storage fees elsewhere
