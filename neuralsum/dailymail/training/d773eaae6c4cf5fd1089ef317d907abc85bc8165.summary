@entity0 plans to spy on all internet visits , emails and texts will cost the taxpayer £ 2billion			1
the extraordinary bill was revealed amid revelations that @entity8 ’s snooping watchdog has grave doubts about the mass surveillance project			1
the @entity11 said the case had ‘ not been made ’ to justify the sweeping expansion in the power of the police and other public bodies to trawl through private communications , including visits to @entity19 and @entity20			1
@entity22 papers , marked restricted , say the orwellian plan could lead to the innocent being wrongly identified as criminals or terrorists and barred from flying			1
grave doubts : the mass surveillance project has sparked fears that it could lead to the innocent being wrongly identified as criminals or terrorists division : splits in the coalition over the proposals were signalled by @entity34 ( left ) while the concerns of the @entity11 were uncovered by the @entity37 mp @entity36 ( right ) a huge row has broken out at @entity39 over the plans , which look certain to be included in the forthcoming @entity41			1
splits in the coalition over the proposals were signalled by @entity34 , the @entity43 president			1
he said : ‘ we did n’t scrap @entity46 cards to back creeping surveillance by other means			1
the state must n’t be able to trace citizens at will			1
’ in opposition , both the @entity37 and the @entity43 were fierce opponents of the policy , first suggested by @entity54 in 2006			1
they are now pointing to the huge estimated cost of the spying project at a time when the government is making cuts elsewhere			1
the @entity61 estimates that the programme – under which internet providers will be paid to store hundreds of millions of pieces of data for up to two years – will cost £ 2billion over its first decade alone			1
beyond this point there will be annual running costs of £ 200million – or £ 380 a minute			1
even these figures , which are based on 2009 prices , could be an underestimate given the complexity of the project – and officials ’ terrible record for estimating the price of it schemes			1
the data will have to be stored securely , in a way which makes it easy for @entity82 , the government listening agency , to access			1
this requires huge resources which the government has agreed to pay			1
the alternative would have seen internet service providers passing on the cost to their customers			1
@entity92 insisted that only times , dates , numbers and email and internet addresses would be accessible by @entity82			2
a warrant will still be required to access the content			2
ministers say the changes are needed to keep pace with technology			2
but the concerns of the @entity11 were uncovered by the @entity37 mp @entity36 , using freedom of information requests			2
staff prepared papers for the commissioner , @entity109 , in 2010 when it was first suggested that the @entity111 might revive @entity54 ’s scheme			2
' this is a stark warning ' the documents say : ‘ our position remains that the case for the retention of this data still needs to be made			1
the value of historic communications data in criminal investigations has not yet been elucidated			2
’ worryingly , they warn of serious consequences for the public if mistakes are made when the data is being stored			2
officials say : ‘ individuals may be wrongly identified , subject to identity fraud or there may just be a mistake			1
how do they put this right ? intelligence can be used to put people on no - fly lists , limit incomes or asset grabs by government agencies			2
‘ there needs to be a clear means of repair when something goes wrong , which it inevitably will at some point			2
’ the papers also warn of the potential for abuse by internet service providers , once they have been paid to collect the data			2
defence : security minister @entity151 said the emphasis was on solving crime rather than ' real - time snooping on everybody 's emails ' ‘ there needs to be some recognition that this additional data will be a honeypot as it will reveal the browsing habits and communications of celebrities , politicians etc. ‘ has a government minister been using web applications to communicate on @entity168 ? just how long has that celebrity being communicating with his alleged mistress on @entity170 ? ’ mr @entity36 said : ‘ this is a stark warning			1
far from improving our security , these flawed plans to privatise @entity0 surveillance will subject every citizen to intrusive monitoring , and expose us to the risk of massive fraud on an unprecedented scale			1
’ @entity8 is already one of the most spied - upon nations – with three million operations carried out under the @entity184 – ostensibly an anti-terror law – over the last decade			1
these have included thousands of operations by town hall bureaucrats , the @entity189 , @entity191 trusts , the @entity192 and a plethora of government departments			2
ministers are under pressure severely to restrict access to the new regime			2
councils have used their existing powers to snoop on families suspected of cheating school catchment area rules and putting their bins out on the wrong day			0
@entity205 sources insist councils will have only very limited access to the information , and will require the approval of a magistrate			0
they will not have access to any sensitive data			0
security minister @entity151 said the emphasis was on solving crime rather than ‘ real - time snooping on everybody ’s emails ’			1
he told @entity217 ’s @entity218 : ‘ we absolutely get the need for appropriate safeguards and for appropriate protections to be put in place around any changes that might come forward			0
‘ what this is not is the previous government ’s plan of creating some sort of great big @entity0 database			0
that is precisely not what this is looking at			0
’ many of us have several devices to communicate with others			0
here , we explain how the new system will affect them : under surveillance : in future , every website visit via your @entity241 or laptop would be kept for a fixed period by your internet service provider @entity247 no change			1
police , the security services and other public bodies can already access data on who you are calling and when , but not the details of what was said			0
this information is stored by phone companies , but a ministerial warrant is required to access it			0
@entity261 officials can already find out who you have called or texted and when , and even pinpoint your location			0
the law does not currently cover modern ways of communicating , such as @entity269			0
in future , those platforms would be tracked too			0
@entity272 / @entity241 some basic data is currently stored , such as when a person started browsing the web			0
in future , every website visit would be kept for a fixed period by your internet service provider			0
this would only detail the address of the website , and not the exact content			0
officials can already see who you email , and when			0
if there is a suspicion of wrongdoing , police and security services can access your correspondence under a warrant			0
@entity170 terrorists have turned to @entity170 , as existing laws do not cover internet telephone calls			0
security officials say this loophole must be closed			0
if their demands are met , they would be able to check who you call and when			0
facebook as with web browsing , social networking data is not routinely stored			0
new rules would give the authorities the right to know who you have been talking to on @entity19 , and when			0
@entity313 security services suspect online gaming – which allows players to chat using headsets or text messages – could be used to plot terrorist activity			0
in future , data would be stored on who gamers play with or talk to .			0
