we readily sit down to watch tv , or read books , or listen to music on the radio			0
but there is one sense we rarely record and play back - the sense of smell - even if we can all recall our favourite scents , such as the smell of coffee in the morning , a freshly - cut lawn or the salty bracing smell of sea air			1
now , graphic designer and photographer @entity14 has been combining her love of maps with her desire to explore our overlooked sense , leading to ' sensory maps ' of cities around the world			1
each map is a labour of love as well as a lot of labour , with @entity14 moving around each city , meeting the people who live and work in the various districts , and then capturing and re-creating the smells she encounters to create the maps			1
her experiences have led her to the fishermen of the @entity36 in @entity37 , who occasionally have to pull bodies from the water , to the ' smelliest ' block of @entity42 , as well as the olfactory delights of @entity44 and the fresh sea air of @entity46 in @entity47			1
all have all come under the keen observation of her nose , and found their way into her maps			2
@entity44 , distilled : @entity14 builds a map of each city , guided by her own experiences and the observations of local people @entity14 says her aim is to sensitize tourists and visitors to a new place , and use a ' largely - ignored sense in their perception of that place '			1
she said : ' smell has a " do not enter brain processing " connection with our emotions , making smell the supreme retainer of memory over our other senses			1
' we have 100 per cent smell recall after one year but only 30 per cent sight memory after three months			1
' the first time we smell a new scent we automatically associate it with whether we like it or not ( positive or negative ) and we associate it with the location where we smell it			2
' therefore i propose that smell can be used in tourism marketing to foster lasting memories of a place			2
' how does @entity37 smell to you ? scents picked up by @entity14 include perfume , fast food , building dust and ' hot bovril at the footy ' speaking to her alumni publication for @entity94 , she said : ' maps are an old graphic device of data visualization			1
' maps show proximity , range , location – all characteristics of smell that are difficult to explain verbally in any kind of a coherent way			2
' moreover i have been fascinated by maps since i was a small child			2
' i wanted to make maps but realized , at ten years of age , that the world had already been discovered			0
so , if the physical , geographical world has been represented then i just had to discover a new territory – my landscape is the smell - scape			1
' @entity42 's smelliest block : @entity116 , car oil , dried fish , cheap perfume and @entity120 all combine to make this a smell to remember @entity14 started with @entity44 ' because it has astonishing emotion - inducing scents			1
' the @entity44 smell map is a virtual dérive , a collection of perfumes placed on shelving on a board showing @entity44 streets			1
audience members walk a pace at a time to sniff as they " wander " the city ’s streets			0
' i moved on to @entity138			2
that city has one pervasive smell – identified as malt extract from the breweries – which sweeps the city ’s streets , but the secondary smells are equally evocative			0
' the maps themselves do not smell ; instead i make up individual scents using only natural ingredients that best reflect the smells i have selected to depict visually			2
' each scent is stored in its own bottle which is stored in a small cabinet underneath the map			0
i prefer to keep the contents of the bottles hidden so that the audience can not rely on visual cues to identify the smells			0
' for this reason i do not label the smells			0
i make most of the smells myself , trying to capture and hold elusive scents in the small bottles			0
' i have learned how to distill rose petals , to create a perfume of stinky cheese , to depict the smell of penguins at the zoo without harming a single penguin			0
i can fabricate the smell of a building site and of boy ’s toilets in primary schools			0
' from the smells of sea , sand and beach to boys toilets in primary schools			0
you may not agree with @entity14 's descriptions , but she does paint quite a sensory picture each project varies slightly as i amend my methodology			1
initially i decided on the smells based on personal experience			0
then i started asking local residents of the city in question to provide me with the smells that they associate with their environments			0
this progressed to asking for comments via my blog and to asking local media to help solicit responses			0
' overall there is nothing to beat talking to local people , and in @entity46 i took time to devise a couple of smell walks and a wonderful smell bike ride			1
bikers are keen sniffers ! ' the resulting conversations revealed a vast amount of data including numerous descriptions of the ocean smell from the bikers ( ocean , salt , weed , brine , home , fog ) and a collection of urban aromas that combined the smell of homes , transport and business with the overall heady aroma of freshly frying bacon just outside the @entity46 police station			1

artist @entity14 's fascination with maps leads to a smell - based record of @entity138 , @entity37 , @entity44 and @entity46
