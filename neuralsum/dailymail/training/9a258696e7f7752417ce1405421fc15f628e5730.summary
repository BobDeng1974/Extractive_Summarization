@entity0 and @entity1 could rekindle their junior partnership this weekend as @entity4 consider naming both players in the starting line - up to face @entity7			1
with @entity9 struck down by illness , head coach @entity8 could be short of options in the midfield for saturday ’s @entity13 against the @entity7			1
@entity14 is also sidelined with a hand injury and the @entity4 selection panel are now deliberating whether to name @entity0 at @entity17 , with @entity20 playmaker @entity18 pulling the strings at fly - half			1
@entity4 coach @entity23 ( right ) works with @entity1 and @entity0 ( left ) in training on monday sir @entity25 urged @entity26 to move @entity0 sir @entity25 wrote in his @entity28 column on monday that @entity4 are in need of a natural kicker like @entity0 at inside centre — something that @entity33 does not offer — and the @entity35 combination would tick that box			1
the pair , who were once opponents at junior rugby league clubs in @entity40 , thrived in the same partnership at @entity4 age - group level , when they lost just two games in five years			2
‘ i ’m sure he ( @entity46 ) will get over the sickness and diarrhoea , but it ’s about how much it takes out of him and the knock - on effect of not doing the work , ’ said @entity8			2
‘ the obvious options are to put @entity1 in at 10 and @entity0 at 12			1
‘ you can bring someone like @entity57 in at 12 , while @entity14 is on a return to play this week but he has n’t done anything for two or three weeks , so is n’t really in the equation for us			0
’ @entity0 ( right ) and @entity18 played for @entity4 in the final of the @entity64 in 2011 @entity65 has hailed @entity4 ’s @entity66 as ‘ one of the best forwards coaches in the world ’ , who has created a ‘ world - class scrum ’			1
he added : ‘ @entity66 is a good friend of mine			0
we coached against each other for the first time in 2012			0
what a great guy and what a great ( team of ) coaching staff — just look at guys like @entity8 , @entity82 and @entity23			2
’ the physical threat posed by the @entity7 might count against @entity18 in selection , but @entity26 will weigh up the pros and cons in tuesday 's training session at @entity88			1
@entity18 ’s small stature — 13st 3lb compared to @entity0 ’s 15st 2lb frame — could lead to him being targeted by some of @entity7 ’s powerful ball - carriers			1
@entity8 added : ‘ it is a four - game series			2
i ’ve got in my own mind further games and options to look at combinations			0
‘ the question in my mind is : do you give the players another opportunity who played their part last week ( in the 24 - 21 defeat by @entity106 ) to improve on that performance ? because there is a lot of frustration			0
’ sir @entity25 says @entity4 are in need of a natural kicker like @entity0 ( right ) at inside centre head injuries to @entity115 and @entity116 mean the @entity118 pair will have cognitive testing ahead of thursday ’s team announcement			1
@entity121 also picked up a minor knock and a hip injury to @entity124 , who is expected to train on tuesday , will have @entity125 on red alert ahead of a possible promotion to the starting xv			0
@entity8 is hopeful that all will be available for selection , while @entity131 is also pushing to oust @entity132 after the no 8 ’s impact off the bench on saturday			1
the latest injury problems are far from ideal for @entity8 , who is hoping to end a barren winless run against @entity7 this weekend			1
@entity4 have suffered 10 defeats and one draw in their last 11 meetings with the @entity141 , having failed to record a victory since 2006			2
the monday morning debrief after saturday ’s defeat at @entity145 was , in the words of loosehead prop @entity147 , ‘ very honest ’ , but focus must now turn towards their next challenge			2
the @entity151 front - row said the second - half performance was worthy of words that he ‘ ca n’t really use ’ and has promised to bottle up the frustration ahead of the second test on saturday			0
‘ the @entity158 teams have set the standard over the years and are continuing to do so , ’ said @entity147			0
‘ but i ’d like to think we ’ve got a squad now who can go toe - to - toe with them			0
it ’s about having the belief that we ’re not just capable of hanging in there against them , but can ramp it up ourselves at the right time and can take them to some darker places			0
’ @entity8 is hoping to end a barren winless run against @entity7 this weekend but while @entity4 will still be seething from their defeat by the @entity106 , @entity7 will arguably be even more aggrieved after their shock 29 - 15 loss to @entity175			1
@entity4 will face some hugely powerful forwards in the likes of @entity178 , @entity179 and @entity180 and @entity147 knows his side must front up if they are to overcome their @entity158 hoodoo			2
‘ against every international team at the moment you ’ve got to be physical otherwise you ’re going to get pumped , ’ said @entity147			0
‘ @entity7 as a nation stand very tall and proud ; their @entity187 is run hard and , if that does n’t work , run harder			0
they pride themselves on that and they ’ve got a world - class tight five			0

sir @entity25 said @entity4 are in need of a natural kicker like @entity0 at inside centre
@entity20 playmaker @entity1 set to be handed no 10 shirt for saturday 's @entity13 against @entity7 at @entity145
@entity9 's illness has left @entity4 head coach @entity8 short of options
