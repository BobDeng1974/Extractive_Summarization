chief constable @entity0 said officers would ' not be as visible on the streets , ' in the future crime victims face having to report offences online then track the progress of investigations ‘ like a parcel ’ under plans by @entity10 ’s second biggest police force to marginalise bobbies on the beat			2
theft , assault and criminal damage victims are among those who will be expected to upload their own evidence in the ‘ self - service ’ reporting system , instead of liaising with an officer face - to - face or by phone			1
as well as supplying pictures of stolen phones or cars , victims will be asked to file crime reports to the web - based portal in plans that will also see the loss of 2,500 staff			1
the ‘ virtual policing ’ plans , unveiled in a five - year blueprint by @entity34 , were condemned by crime victims			1
@entity37 , whose son @entity38 , 20 , was one of three men killed protecting homes in the 2011 summer riots in @entity42 , said the plans ‘ did n’t inspire confidence ’			0
mr @entity37 , from @entity45 , said : ‘ for a victim of crime , one - to - one interaction with a human is important			2
’ he added that many elderly people would have difficulties with the new system			0
@entity42 lawyer @entity53 , who had to track down and recover his stolen @entity54 in 2013 because officers were too busy to attend , said ‘ a faceless online service ... could lead to important evidence being missed ’			1
the force also wants to encourage witnesses to supply images or video footage of incidents such as street thefts or assaults			0
its new operating model will see neighbourhood officers deployed into specific areas , instead of across the force patch , leaving middle class areas where crime is less of an issue without a significant uniform presence			0
the force said the changes were needed as part of cuts aimed at saving £ 130million over the next four years			1
chief constable @entity0 admitted that officers would ‘ not be as visible on the streets ’ in future , as the force looked to achieve ‘ greater efficiency ’			0
@entity34 have unveiled a five year blueprint for ' virtual policing ' plans			1

the force wants to encourage online reporting of all but the most serious offences			0
@entity98 , @entity99 , said : ‘ we hope that by the end of this year you will be able to log in and watch the progress of an investigation in the same way that you can track a parcel			0
