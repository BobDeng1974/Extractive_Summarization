’ she hated that name			2

and i just admire him in every way			2
i feel like he teaches me things			0

she believed maybe this was destiny stepping in and that she belonged with @entity76 and not with @entity0			1
the first time she met @entity76 in 1998 backstage while he was performing on @entity103 , his first words to her were ‘ one day you ’re going to be my wife ’ – a good come - on			1
‘ the reality was i did n’t want to be alone ’ , she confesses , and she let herself be swept up in his charm and his arms believing he was her ‘ knight in shining armor			0

@entity76 was going to be her rock and they ’d live happily ever after			1
but that only happens in fairytales …			0

‘ family is most important ’ – was her mantra			0
seven years later , in 2011 , both knew the marriage was over			0
‘ my own happiness and sense of self - worth depended on how happy he was			2
