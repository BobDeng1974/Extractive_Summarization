an elderly patient is suing the hospital where she was left blind after the surgeon collapsed during her routine cataract operation			1
@entity5 ’s operation was halted when @entity6 told colleagues that he felt dizzy , lay down on the operating theatre floor and said : ‘ i am not fit to do it			1
’ it took 30 minutes to find another surgeon and the delay cost mrs @entity5 her sight , according to legal papers lodged at the @entity15			1
the botched operation has had a devastating effect on the great - grandmother , say her family			1
mrs @entity5 relied almost totally on the sight in her right eye as her left eye had been badly damaged in a childhood accident			1
when specialists examined her right eye the next day , it was found to be ‘ completely blind ’			2
mrs @entity5 , 84 , is suing the world - famous @entity26 in @entity28 , which was in charge of her care , for more than £ 50,000			1
the former secretary and mother of four had been reluctant to have the cataract operation because she was worried it could go wrong			2
although the cataract was slowly clouding her vision , affecting her ability to read small print and do crosswords , its impact was otherwise limited			0
but after her husband @entity42 had a successful cataract operation in april 2011 , she finally agreed to go ahead with surgery			0
that september , she went to the @entity45 at @entity46 near her home in @entity48 , @entity28 , for surgery			2
it is one of the specialist hospital ’s ‘ district hubs ’ and employs its own staff			2
when she arrived , she was still ‘ very worried ’ , according to the court papers			0
mr @entity6 apparently tried to reassure her but in doing so , according to her lawyers , he neglected to outline the full risks of the operation			0
the surgery involves making a slit in the eye , taking out the clouded lens and replacing it with a clear plastic one			0
the court papers claim : ‘ mr @entity6 nodded and smiled but did not engage in any discussion about the risks and benefits of the surgery			1
’ mr @entity6 , who is deeply saddened that mrs @entity5 has lost the sight in her right eye , denies the allegations , saying mrs @entity5 was made aware of the risks of the surgery			2
he says he did engage in a discussion with her on the day of surgery			0
his position is that she was given a consent booklet several weeks before her operation and when she was asked if there were any outstanding questions or concerns there were none and she signed the consent form			0
mrs @entity5 then signed a consent form warning that the operation carried a one - in - 1,000 risk of severe and permanent sight loss			1
however , lawyers claim that because of mrs @entity5 ’s particular circumstances , the real risk to her was actually one in 333			1
just minutes into the operation , mr @entity6 ‘ said he felt light - headed and dizzy with tightness across his chest , ’ according to the court papers			1
they state that he ‘ lay down on the floor ’ and told a trainee surgeon : ‘ you need to get a consultant surgeon now			1
you ca n’t do this one yourself			0
i am not fit to do it			0
’ the surgery was carried out at @entity45 at @entity46 ( above ) in @entity48 , @entity28 mrs @entity5 , who had received local anaesthetic but was conscious , then had to wait about 30 minutes for a qualified surgeon to arrive			1
the consultant , @entity112 , ‘ noted that a large proportion of the intraocular contents were outside the eye ’			0
she closed the cut with five sutures			0
another surgeon arrived minutes later , ‘ removed the remaining eye contents and sutured the eye closed ’			0
tests the next day showed mrs @entity5 had no vision at all in that eye			2
her lawyers claim mr @entity6 was exhausted because he had been overworked			0
‘ on the balance of probabilities , ’ they claim , his collapse ‘ occurred as a result of extreme fatigue caused by a work schedule which required him to work on wednesdays from early morning until late in the evening without the opportunity to take regular breaks or to eat meals ’			0
mrs @entity5 ’s daughter @entity130 , 53 , said last night the operation had deeply affected her mother and the whole family			1
‘ it has completely stopped life as she knew it , ’ she added			0
the family was later told that because mrs @entity5 had high blood pressure and was lying on the operating table with no lens , her eye ‘ gel ’ had leaked out			1
@entity142 said : ‘ it would be inappropriate for us to comment at this stage as the claim is subject to ongoing legal proceedings			2
