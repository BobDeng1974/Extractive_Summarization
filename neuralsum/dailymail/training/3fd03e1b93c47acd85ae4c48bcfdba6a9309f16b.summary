the 27 - year - old went to pray at a mosque in @entity21 on friday and has not been seen since , @entity18 announced last night			1
home secretary @entity5 may face criticism in the @entity7 today over the ability of the police and security services to track suspects through @entity27 and @entity28 ( @entity30 ) notices			1
it comes as the @entity32 launched a criminal probe into electronic tagging contracts handed to @entity35 and @entity36			2
police released @entity39 pictures of the @entity3 , apparently wearing the traditional garb			1
@entity18 refused to comment on the offences he is suspected of			2
however they said he was not ‘ a direct threat to the public			2
’ his escape prompted renewed political debate about the role of the appropriateness of @entity17 dress in @entity52 life			2
it follows a court case earlier this year in which a woman was required to show her face to jurors and the judge while giving evidence			2
@entity3 is one of a small number of terror suspects whose movements are restricted by a court order because of the threat they pose to the public			1
worryingly , he is the second person under a @entity27 and @entity28 notice to have absconded in the past year			2
nine such orders are in force			2
@entity17 clothing : @entity3 is seen leaving the @entity70 and @entity71 in @entity72 , west @entity21 the coalition announced in 2011 it would end @entity76 's control orders regime used to track and disrupt terror suspects			1
they were replaced by @entity27 and @entity28 ( @entity30 ) , which include restrictions on overnight residence , travel and finance			2
@entity30 are imposed by the home secretary who is given access to secret evidence that can not be placed before juries			0
they do not allow for the relocation of suspects , as control orders did			0
unlike control orders , @entity30 also have a maximum time limit of two years			0
control orders could be extended year on year without limit , while @entity30 can be extended after a year for another 12 months before they expire			0
some liberty campaigners said @entity30 are control orders - lite , accusing the government of bottling the decision on the future of counter-terrorism powers			1
but others , include @entity76 , complaining that they are not tough enough and allow suspects to move around the country			0
there were nine @entity30 in force as of august 31 , including eight against @entity52 suspects			0
it follows the disappearance on @entity108 of @entity109 who failed to return home on time to comply with his curfew			1
he has still not been found			0
@entity3 's disappeared in a black cab in december after ripping off his electronic tag			1
his disappearance is a major blow to police and the security services			1
the @entity120 said @entity3 attended the @entity121 in @entity72 , @entity21 , at 10am on friday			1
he was seen inside the mosque at 3.15pm			1
a spokesman said he changed into @entity17 clothing and ‘ has not been seen since ’			0
a spokesman said : ‘ the @entity126 immediately launched inquiries to trace mr @entity3 and these continue			1
‘ ports and borders were notified with his photograph and details circulated nationally			0
public safety remains our priority			0
’ he said anyone who sees him should call 999			0
in the @entity7 mrs may insisted @entity3 does not pose a direct threat to the @entity52 public even though the 27 - year - old is understood to have received training and fought overseas for @entity141 , the @entity13 - based cell of the militant @entity9 group @entity143			1
to laughs and shouts from the @entity76 benches , mrs may said : ' the police and security service have confirmed that they do not believe that this man poses a direct threat to the public in the @entity52			1
' the reason he was put on a @entity30 in the first place was to prevent his travel to support terrorism overseas			0
' but @entity76 's @entity155 said the disappearance of @entity109 and @entity3 was proof that the decision to replace control orders with @entity159 was a mistake			1
ms @entity155 said : ' since the home secretary got rid of relocation orders , got rid of control orders and brought in the weaker @entity30 , two terror suspects have vanished			0
risks : home secretary @entity5 insisted that @entity3 posed no risk to the public concern : @entity3 is described as 5ft 8ins tall and of medium build ' her policies brought these two terror suspects back into contact with their old networks , with people who could help them disappear and made it easier for these terror suspects to run off			1
' she went on : ' @entity30 apply to a very small number of difficult cases and everyone recognises there was no perfect answer and there will always be challenges			0
' but this home secretary has made it easier for serious terror suspects to disappear and that is irresponsible			0
' she was warned about changing the law , she was warned about weakening controls , she was warned more people would abscond and they have , twice			0
' but still she wo n't act			2
the question on everyone 's lips is how many more warnings does this home secretary need ? ' @entity3 is described as 5ft 8ins tall and of medium build			1
@entity109 , 28 , was the first person to go missing while on a @entity30			0
it was later claimed he fled simply by jumping into a black cab			0
the case prompted a review of how such terror suspects are monitored			0
@entity30 are a watered down form of control order which allow the courts to place restrictions on a terror suspect ’s behaviour			0
they can be required to obey a curfew , are banned from mixing with named individuals and using the internet			0
control orders were watered down in 2011 following demands from the @entity215 who said they breached civil liberties			0
security minister @entity218 said : ‘ national security is the government ’s top priority and the police are doing everything in their power to apprehend this man as quickly as possible			1
‘ the police and security services do not believe that this man poses a direct threat to the public in the @entity52			1
‘ the home secretary , on police advice , yesterday applied to the @entity233 for an order protecting anonymity to be lifted in order to assist with their investigation			2
