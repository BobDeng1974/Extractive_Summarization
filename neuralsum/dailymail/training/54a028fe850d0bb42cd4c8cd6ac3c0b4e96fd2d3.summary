it was the boredom of marking exams that led him to write his acclaimed first novel @entity4			2
and , a newly uncovered letter reveals , this wandering mind was a life - long affliction for professor @entity8 – and not one he was proud of			1
in the letter , which goes up for auction at @entity11 on wednesday , the academic , who held professorships in both @entity15 and @entity16 at @entity17 , laments his early days as an inattentive pupil			0

’ @entity24 : a letter written by @entity26 author @entity8 deriding teaching has emerged for sale - telling a newly - qualified teacher it is ' exhausting and depressing ' admission : @entity8 replied to a teacher from @entity32 who read her class @entity4 to keep them calm the half - typed , half - handwritten note – which is expected to fetch between £ 1,500 and £ 2,000 at auction – was a reply to @entity39 , at newly qualified teacher at @entity41 in @entity32 , who had read @entity4 to calm her usually restless class			1
one of her pupils was so moved by the book they penned a note to the author which mrs @entity39 dutifully forwarded on			2
in his response , professor @entity8 complimented the student , saying he received many such letters but ‘ few as well penned as this ’			0
however , under the official typed reply , the academic handwrote an aside for mrs @entity39 , where he expressed his dissatisfaction with their shared profession , describing teaching as ‘ exhausting and depressing ’ and complained that ‘ one is seldom comforted by knowing when one has had some effect ’			1

this nonsense sentence went on to become the first words of @entity4 and launched one of the twentieth century ’s most successful literary careers			0
since first being published in 1937 , the children ’s novel has sold more than 100 million copies			0
after receiving the letter , mrs @entity39 filed it away and promptly forgot all about it before rediscovering it last year			2
