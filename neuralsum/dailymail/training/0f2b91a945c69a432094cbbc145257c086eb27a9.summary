a solar flare was revealed in a @entity3 @entity2 video on thursday			1
the wednesday afternoon event was ' significant , ' the space organization said in the video 's description			1
' solar flares are powerful bursts of radiation			2
harmful radiation from a flare can not pass through @entity14 's atmosphere to physically affect humans on the ground , ' @entity3 said			1
' however -- when intense enough -- they can disturb the atmosphere in the layer where gps and communications signals travel			0
it has been several years since @entity14 has had a solar storm of this size coming from sunspots smack in the middle of the sun , @entity35 , director of the @entity36 in @entity37 , @entity38 , told the @entity45 wednesday			1
the flare on the sun barely hits the ' extreme ' on forecasters ' scale , but with its worst effects missing @entity14 it is only looking ' potentially strong ' at most when it arrives at @entity14 as a solar storm , he said			1
new calculations from satellite data show that the worst of the energetic particles streaming from the sun likely will go north or above @entity14 this time , @entity52 said late wednesday			2
so while the power grid may see fluctuations because the storm will cause changes in @entity14 's magnetic field , it wo n't knock power systems off line , @entity52 said			1
it may cause slight disturbances in satellites and radio transmissions but nothing major			0
not as scary as it looks ! though the solar flare is blasting its way to @entity14 , the worst of its power looks like it will barely skim above the planet and not cause many problems solar storms occur often , especially during peaks in the solar cycle , and do n't directly harm people			1
' we 're not scared of this one , ' @entity52 said			0
the storm is moving medium fast , about 2.5 million miles per hour , meaning the soonest it could arrive is early friday			1
but it could be later , @entity52 said			0
solar storms occur often , especially during peaks in the solar cycle , and do n't directly harm people			1
' there 's been a giant magnetic explosion on the sun , ' @entity52 said			0
' because it 's pointed right at us , we 'll at least catch some of the cloud ' of highly energized and magnetized plasma that can disrupt @entity14 's magnetic sphere , which sometimes leads to temporary power grid problems			2
on the plus side , sun flares expand the colorful northern lights so people farther south can see them			0
but do n't expect them too far south , @entity52 said			0
@entity104 's @entity103 said a coronal mass ejection took place thursday evening shortly before 7pm on @entity107			0
@entity108 reported friday flares may be visible ' as far south as @entity110 in the @entity111 and down over @entity112 farther west			0
' there may be storms saturday , the @entity36 also said			2
where can i watch ? @entity108 indicated which areas of the @entity118 and @entity119 will be able to see the lights friday			0

@entity3 said the wednesday afternoon solar flare was ' significant '
the solar flare is blasting its way to @entity14 , but does n't look like it will cause many problems , @entity35 of the @entity36 said
the storm is moving medium fast , about 2.5 million miles per hour , meaning the soonest it could arrive is early friday , he said
