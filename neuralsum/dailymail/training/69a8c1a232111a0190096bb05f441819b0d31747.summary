by @entity0 any worried pet owner who has spent days hanging posters , making phone calls and knocking on neighbors ' doors hopes there 's a more scientific way to find a lost dog			1
that has become a reality thanks to facial recognition technology that has been tested to successfully reunite a pet with its owner			0
a website scours an online database to search for distinctive features on dogs and matches them up with animals that are reported lost			1
scientists at the @entity22 create system to find lost dogs ( shown )			1
their website called @entity26 matches dogs with an online database			1
it studies distinctive features on dogs such as eyes and snout			1
this is then correlated with dogs at a shelter to reunite them with owners the website is called @entity40 and was recently used to successfuly reuinte a pet at @entity42 with its owners			1
for centuries , dogs have been man 's best friend			0
but it turns out canines would drop humanity for artificial intelligence in a second if offered a treat			0
a study in @entity55 found that dogs interacted with robots similar to how they would with humans if those robots seemed ' social '			1
the researchers conducted their experiment by having a robot point out hidden food to a dog and measuring their reactions to the robots directions			0
but the dogs were better able to find the hidden food when the robot had a human face on it 's monitor , and acted ' socially '			1
the website keeps a database of photos from the three county shelters and tries to match eight distinctive facial markers on dogs with images uploaded by users searching for lost pets			1
eyes and noses are important areas that differentiate pooches , including eye size and their position near the snout			1
@entity26 founder @entity87 wants to expand the photo database to improve the odds of more missing dogs being reuinted , with shelters elsewhere set to sign on			2
he 's also showing it to rescues , veterinarians and dog groups and is visiting other countries			0
every dog entering @entity99 's three shelters is added to the photo database			0
@entity101 , the system 's deputy director , says the program can work two ways : someone can find a dog , take its picture and sends it to the database , where a match generates a notice to the owner			1
the owner then can call the good samaritan and arrange a pickup			0
the other method is that dogs coming in to the shelters have their photos run against the database			2
if there 's a match , the owner gets a call			0
here founder of the smart phone application @entity123 is seen during a news conference in @entity99			2
in may , @entity42 became the first shelter system in the country to adapt the facial recognition plan the technology powering @entity123 was built by dr @entity129 and dr @entity130 of the @entity22 's software development center			1
they found the eight markers on dogs are far fewer than the 128 points on the human facial recognition program			2
' people are sort of uniform , the shape of their faces , skin tones , all their eyes , noses and mouths are in the same general location , ' dr @entity137 said			0
but dogs ' eyes and snouts are in different places			2
it 's difficult to measure accuracy , dr @entity137 said , but if there are 100 dogs in a database , a top - three match would be hit 98 percent of the time			2
' it worked surprisingly well , better than i thought it would			0
i had low expectations , ' dr @entity137 said			0
' it would take off if you had all the shelters in an area included			0

stray dogs found can also be *photographed* by a person and matched
