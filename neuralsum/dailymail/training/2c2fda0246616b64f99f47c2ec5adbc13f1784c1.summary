@entity87 , @entity88 executive spokesperson for housing and planning said : ‘ this decision is to be welcomed			0
‘ the site could not stay as it was			0
residents did not have access to suitable sanitation , the encampment was unauthorised and it was having a negative impact on the surrounding environment and the wider @entity100 community			0
