changes : education secretary @entity1 said the @entity2 will help raise educational standards in @entity5 's schools the @entity2 could be given the power to run thousands of secular state schools after agreeing a landmark deal with the @entity9			1
the church will be forced to preserve the character of non-faith schools and community schools joining a @entity2 academy chain would not have to change its admissions policy , religious education lessons or employment terms for teachers , according to the @entity20 newspaper			1
bishops will also have the power to appoint governors at the schools			0
but the move has been criticised by secular groups , who said the decision would irreversibly increase religious influence over state schools			1
@entity31 , of the @entity32 , told @entity20 : ' this will surreptitiously bring the education system under religious control			0
' it will lead to the further alienation of school children who are from non-religious or religiously unconcerned families			0
' despite now being the majority , they are becoming increasingly disadvantaged in admissions and by the growing religionisation of publicly - funded schools			2
' once schools have been taken over by religious interests , it will be almost impossible to ever bring them back under community control			0
' education secretary @entity1 praised the standards and popularity of church schools during a seminar at @entity53 yesterday and urged a continuing partnership with the @entity2			1
in a statement mr @entity1 said : ' we would not have so many great state schools in this country without the @entity2			1
' i know the @entity2 does a wonderful job helping to raise educational standards and in providing a safe and loving environment for hundreds of thousands of children			2
' however , there is much more we can do together			0
i want the @entity2 to recover the spirit which infused its educational mission in @entity68 times and support more new schools - especially academies and free schools - to bring educational excellence to the nation 's poorest children			1
' approximately one million children currently attend @entity2 schools			2
mission : the archbishop of @entity80 @entity79 said the move would help the church ' transform every part of our society ' there are 4,484 @entity2 primary and middle schools , a quarter of the total , and 193 secondary schools			1
the @entity91 , the @entity93 @entity92 , who leads education policy within the @entity2 , believes small village primary schools will want to join academy trusts led by its schools to secure their future , and promised they would be ' safe with us ' , the @entity20 said			1
@entity101 said : ' this will be a way for them to have the security of a larger body with mutual support , with resources that are much more extensive			0
' he added : ' dioceses have the privilege and opportunity to put local church and local school into the same box , as it were , and say that 's where the mission of the @entity2 lies			2
' the bishop said mr @entity1 had set the @entity2 a challenge to ' raise our game ' , which ' echoes our own determination to make a real step change in the way we serve our communities , working to the highest standards '			1
@entity101 said : ' i think people may not realise the significance of what looks like a small technical change but actually allows the mutual support , the drawing together of resources , experiments in collaboration			0
' it allows a whole lot more and it will enhance the educational experience of millions of children			0
' the archbishop of @entity80 , the most rev @entity79 , said the vision for church schools would ' continue our mission of transforming every part of our society '			2
' it is obviously true that good schools help produce an educated workforce , ' the @entity141 said			0
' but the @entity152 vision is a far greater one			0
it is about setting a framework for children as they learn , which enables them to be confident when faced with the vast challenges that our rapidly changing culture brings to us			0
' secular groups have expressed concern about the extent of religious influence the move would allow			1
rabbi dr @entity166 , chairman of the @entity167 , which campaigns for admissions and recruitment in state schools to be free from religious discrimination , said : ' despite the positive aspects of church schools , those that select pupils on the basis of their faith are not only guilty of discrimination , but also help to fragment society			2
' a tolerant pluralist society can only be created by having tolerant pluralist schools where children of all backgrounds grow up and interact together			0
' if @entity1 really wants church schools to recover the spirit which infused the @entity2 's educational mission in @entity68 times then he must make sure that church schools are not permitted to segregate and divide , but are made open and suitable for all in their respective local communities			1

education secretary @entity1 agrees deal with the church
@entity198 and community schools to join @entity2 academy chains
church will not be allowed to change admissions policy or re lessons
