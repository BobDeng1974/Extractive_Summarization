i ’ve just met a guy online and we really clicked but he turns out to be a 32 - year - old virgin ! he ’s attractive and it makes me wonder if he ’s damaged in some way … he does n’t want sex and we ’ve been dating for three months			1
what ’s going on ? is it secretly gay ? he says he ’s a virgin but i do n’t believe him … two unusual emails plopping into my inbox ? or an indication of something that ’s more common than you think			1
the answer is the latter			2
society views men as sex - crazed – willing , able and ready to have sex with anything that stands still for longer than a minute - but in reality , it ’s easier for an older man to end up a virgin than you think			1
accidental virgins tend to morph into terrified virgins			1
he starts off feeling a little hung up about it then it becomes a big deal ( posed by model ) sometimes it ’s deliberate : for religious or moral reasons , some men do n’t believe in sex before marriage			1
others see it as something special and do n't want it diluted with several partners or want to marry a virgin and figure if they expect her to be , they should be too			0
for others , it ’s accidental : this guy simply missed the point when everyone else did ‘ it ’			1
maybe his girlfriend was less keen on putting out than other girls			0
maybe he was less sure of what to do , so did n’t push it			0
maybe he was shy or did n’t find it that easy to get a girlfriend until much later than everyone else			0
the end result is the same : he ’s still a virgin and all his friends are n’t			0
accidental virgins tend to morph into terrified virgins			1
he starts off feeling a little hung up about it then it becomes a big deal			0
terrified he ’ll embarrass himself , he avoids making any sexual advances at all			1
girls are n’t used to men not wanting to sleep with them so he quickly gets a reputation of being ‘ a bit weird ’ or ‘ gay ’ and before he knows it , he ’s scared of dating and sex			1
add porn to the mix. it ’s so readily available and prolific , men no longer need to go out and pursue women to satisfy themselves sexually			2
why should they when they can stay at home and explore all their sexual fantasies online with no risk of rejection or ridicule ? romantic relationships are stressful to lots of men			2
it was bad enough being an 18 - year - old virgin , being a 30 or 40 - year - old one seems unbearable			0
older male virgins look to their partner to teach them and with time and patience , could mould into your idea of the perfect lover the longer a guy stays a virgin , the more difficult it becomes to lose it			1
he becomes adept at hiding what feels like a hideous secret , loses all confidence and suddenly he ’s landed where he is now - fast approaching middle - age without ever having had sexual intercourse			0
should you go there if you come across this guy ? some women claim being the first to introduce a man to the pleasures of sex is the ultimate in sexual head - games , a lusty sensation unlike anything else they 've experienced			2
virgins pay attention and listen			2
there are a lot of guys out there who think they 're great lovers - but they 're not			0
tell them they 're doing something wrong and they get offended			0
with a virgin , it 's usually different			2
they look to their partner to teach them and with time and patience , could mould into your idea of the perfect lover ! but sleeping with a virgin is a risk emotionally because it ’s common for male virgins to move on quickly once they have done the deed			1
' i associate my first time with embarrassment , feeling inadequate and shameful			0
i ’d rather forget the person who witnessed that , ' said one man who lost his virginity at 34			0
proceed - but with caution			0
