by @entity0 published : 17:05 est , 30 september 2013 updated : 05:11 est , 1 october 2013 children 's happiness has been sacrificed in the obsessive race for exam results at state schools , a leading independent head teacher said yesterday			2
dr @entity8 , chairman of the @entity10 ’ and @entity11 ’ conference , said it was assumed that academic success would lead to happiness , not the other way round			1
government education policy since the latter part of the 20th century had acted like a ‘ dead restraining hand ’ , he argued , culminating in the ‘ flawed ’ reliance on school league tables			1
excessive interference : dr @entity8 , the chairman of the @entity21 said it was assumed academic success would lead to happiness , not the other way around ‘ the story of the last 50 years is the intrusion of @entity31 and the disappearance of the child , ’ said dr @entity8 , master of @entity27 , @entity28			1
‘ more radically put , it is by extension the intrusion of the @entity37 and the disappearance of love			2
' the long , interfering arm and dead restraining hand of @entity31 has emasculated the education system of this country			1
’ @entity52 ‘ zeal for egalitarianism ’ had been followed by the @entity44 ’ fixation with ‘ league table - driven academic excellence ’ , which meant ‘ pastoral care has been distorted and down valued within the maintained sector ’			1
dr @entity8 added : ‘ the post- 80s drive on academic standards was based on the mistaken belief that you do not need to make a child happy as your first priority , so that they can be successful as your second			1
‘ indeed , it believed that if you make a child academically successful , then happiness will follow			2
’ this had led to ‘ excessive curricular interference ’			0
‘ principles of commercial accountability were transferred to the education of the child			2
hence the flawed mechanism and , still worse , flawed metric of league tables , ’ he went on			1
dr @entity8 said independent schools had maintained their focus on children ’s well - being and were also better at providing extra-curricular activities			1
he made his comments at the annual meeting of the conference , which represents more than 300 independent schools			1
the organisation was founded in 1869 amid an atmosphere of @entity88 recognition of ‘ the existence of the child ’ , he said			0
‘ it was the age when the child could ask for more and , newly , expect to be heard , ’ dr @entity8 added , before referencing two characters from the @entity88 novels of @entity93			1
‘ the underlying historic realisation was that children are special			0
and , because of this , they should be loved – not threatened by violence by the likes of mr @entity101 or filled with facts by the likes of mr @entity104			0
‘ this background is important			0
for if it was the 19th century that invented this understanding of the child , it is the 21st that bids fair to hold its funeral			0
the chief mission and pride of our schools , historically and at the present , is to keep that concept of the child alive and cherished			0
’ in a challenge to @entity31 control , he added : ‘ children and childhood are too precious to be abandoned to the anonymous and impersonal guardianship of the @entity37			0
@entity37 is not currently suitable to direct education unaided or unchallenged because it does not understand the child			2
’ private schools risk haemorrhaging ‘ huge numbers of pupils ’ because fees are becoming unaffordable , a leading head teacher said			0
the warning came from @entity131 , head of @entity133 ’s @entity132 in @entity134 , who added : ‘ this will lead to a more widespread view in our society that we are bastions of privilege			0
’ annual day - only fees are just over £ 12,000 a year			2
boarding schools typically charge £ 27,600 per pupil .			0
