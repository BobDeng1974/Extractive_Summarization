investigators probing the racist spray painting last month of the small - town @entity3 home of an eighth - grade football player are now focusing on the 13 - year - old boy 's mother			1
@entity8 , mother of football player @entity9 , is now being investigated as the sole suspect in a crime that shocked the town and nation when she blamed her son 's teammates for spray painting racist graffiti all over the family 's home			1
‘ @entity20 do n’t need n * * * * * s ' was found spray painted on the side of their @entity25 home			1
the school cancelled the remainder of the @entity20 ' season in response			1
a wednesday search of ms @entity8 and mr @entity9 ' home turned up cans of spray paint and multiple round of live ammunition , according to affidavit cited by the @entity55			1
it was all a lie : ms @entity8 still has this picture posted to her @entity59 profile , but officials are pointing the finger at her federal agents also interrogated the embattled mother , and stated in the affidavit she wanted the investigation to end because she had committed the crime			1
' @entity8 stated she had painted over the graffiti and that she wanted nothing further to do with the investigation , ' the affidavit said			1
mr @entity69 even appeared to halfheartedly admit her guilt under further questioning ' @entity8 was told by ( an ) @entity74 agent that she wanted the investigation to stop because she was the one who spray painted the graffiti on her house and @entity8 stated ‘ ok , ' thew affidavit continued			1
she professed the innocence of both her son and husband @entity78 before leaving the local police station in tears , said the affidavit			2
the teen 's mother is white and his father is half black			2
ms @entity8 and @entity78 refused an offer from authorities to remove the graffiti , the affidavit continued before adding that aerosol cans were found burnt in an outdoor fire pit			1
no arrest is imminent , according to the @entity93 , but cops are now working to compare the graffiti to handwriting samples			2
' most of the leads that we have followed up throughout the investigation have led back toward the house , ' an official told the @entity93			0
locals talking to the @entity93 expressed shock and disbelief over the allegations			0
' it ’s pretty shocking , if it ’s really his mom , ' said sophomore basketball player @entity111			0
' if it ’s true , she did n’t just put her son through a lot , she put this whole town through a lot			2

' this is n’t that kind of town , ' she told the paper			0
' if it was the mother , that ’s just really sad			2
' a friend of @entity9 expressed a similar sentiment			0
' i do n’t see why she would do such a thing and have our school disgraced			2

' i have two younger brothers and another sister			0
this is our house , this is where we live			0
eventually , they 're going to see it			0

players were given an opportunity to come forward with information about the graffiti incident during a team meeting in the days after the incident was first reported , none came forward and the season was cancelled			1
the lack of an admission of guilt by any players make more sense in light of the most recent revelations			2
' we did n't want this ' : father @entity78 ( right ) initially said he and ms @entity8 ( left ) had no idea the incident would receive this much attention @entity181 superintendent @entity180 then announced that the remainder of the school 's football season would be forfeited			1

’ venom from locals over the decision to cancel the rest of the football season was spewed not at the team , but at the family			1
@entity9 ’s father @entity78 , who owns a local construction company , has said he was listening to a local radio call - in about the incident when one of the callers blamed his family for causing all the problems			1
terrible : officials believe this racist graffiti was scrawled on the house by ms @entity8 he just wanted to play football : instead his mother 's alleged actions cost his team the remainder of the season ‘ we did nothing wrong - it has been turned around like we did something wrong and we 're the victims , ’ he said at the time ‘ we did n't want any of this stuff ...			1
everything happened so fast , ' he continued			0
' we only expected a little bit of local attention after it happened			0
we 're not vicious parents out to ruin the town			0
i 'm hoping in the next few days someone steps forward			0
’ the graffiti , which is being investigated by the @entity74 as a hate crime , is just the latest accusation of racism that the team is facing			1

' it 's gross to think someone did this and just stood back and let us take the blame for this , senior @entity273 said			0
