by @entity0 @entity1 : 01:30 est , 21 december 2013 @entity2 : 02:11 est , 21 december 2013 the busy pavement of @entity4 in @entity5 has come a long way since 1848 , when the oldest photo of the historical street was captured			1
the photo sold at an auction in @entity11 for $ 62,500 is unrecognizable when compared to the bright lights and bustling energy of @entity4 today			1
the @entity14 reported that on the back of the photograph it said , ' taken the last of october , when nearly half of the leaves were off the trees			0
' the real deal : this photo sold for $ 62,500 at an auction a few years ago and shows a quite different @entity4 than the one we know today the photo is likely of @entity27 road which became @entity4 in 1899 , reported @entity28			1
the @entity14 reported that @entity27 road is now what would be @entity31 's @entity30			0
the photograph referred to the location as being ' the main road ' and is thought to be an extension of @entity4			1
the photo is a daguerreotype , a style of photography invented by @entity40 and @entity41 in 1839			1
it is one of the earliest photographic processes and is the world 's first permanent camera , according to @entity47			0
@entity40 was a visual artist and a developer of the diorama theater			0
@entity50 invented the world 's first image capturing heliograph in july 1822 and when the men joined forces they were able to create a contraption that would capture an image that could later be developed into a photograph			0
according to @entity61 , ' a daguerreotype consists of a silvered copper plate , which bears the image , and a housing to protect the plate			2
' the photo was then developed in a dark room in two ways : either by exposing the plate to heated mercury or by exposing the plate to solar rays through a red filter			2
@entity4 today : towering skyscrapers and blinking lights replace trees and quaint estates the daguerreotype ( pictured here ) was invented by @entity40 and @entity41 in 1839 and is the world 's first permanent camera @entity28 reports that the daguerreotype made it 's way from @entity83 to @entity5 in 1839 and very few photos have survived			1
therefore , there may be an old photo of @entity5 somewhere else but it is highly unlikely			0
the oldest photo surfaced yesterday when a twitter user by the name of @entity91 posted a photo he claimed was the oldest			1
it read , ' believed to be the oldest photograph taken of @entity5			0
' websites like @entity28 and @entity96 proved him wrong by publishing the true old new york , trees and white picket fences and all			0
looks old but not old enough : this photo was claimed to be the oldest surviving photo of @entity5 yesterday			2

the oldest photo of @entity4 was taken in 1848 and consists of one estate upon a grassy hill
the photo was sold for 62,500 at an auction in @entity11 several years ago
the oldest photo is a daguerreotype , one of the oldest *methods* of photography
