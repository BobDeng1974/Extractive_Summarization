by @entity0 published : 09:56 est , 14 august 2013 updated : 09:57 est , 14 august 2013 @entity1 is always a devastating disease that forever changes the lives of every single person it affects , whether it hits them directly or indirectly , and whether the sickness responds well to treatment or not			1
but @entity8 , diagnosed with @entity9 aged just 21 over christmas 2008 , was one of the lucky ones			1
for @entity8 , an overweight , out - of - shape , beer - drinking ' rugby lad ' from @entity13 , the malignant 15cm tumour growing in his neck - along with the the ensuing seven months of brutal chemotherapy and radiotherapy - was the wake - up call he needed to radically shake - up his life			1
@entity8 during his chemotherapy treatment , left , and now , right , as a muscly personal trainer @entity8 , left , with a friend on a ' lads ' night out ' before 2008 , when he was diagnosed with cancer and was forced to radically rethink his life following his treatment , when he was given the all - clear , doctors at the @entity28 cancer hospital in @entity29 warned him that treatment had ravaged his body and left it severely weakened			1
he was now more susceptible to life - threatening diseases such as heart attacks , strokes , high cholesterol and high blood pressure			1
@entity8 wanted to ensure he had the best possible chance of a long and healthy future with his girlfriend - now wife - @entity39			1
he knew it was up to him to make changes himself			2
newly inspired , @entity8 immediately began reading exhaustively around nutrition , health and fitness			1
he stopped eating heavily processed foods , high - fat foods , high - sugar foods and junk			2
he hit the gym and the rugby field			2
streamlining his diet and dialling up his activity levels , @entity8 saw results almost immediately			2
@entity8 says cancer was the wake - up call he needed to sort his life out , focus on his health and get into shape @entity8 said : ' i was always an active lad - always playing rugby and cricket , even during my treatment - but my diet was n't good			1
i was your typical rugby boy : i loved curries and beers			0
at 5ft 9in and 15st 5lb i had a big old belly on me ' speaking to @entity69 , he said : ' i was always an active lad - always playing rugby and cricket , even during my treatment - but my diet was n't good			1
i was your typical rugby boy : i loved curries and beers			0
at 5ft 9in and 15st 5lb i had a big old belly on me			1
' doctors were blunt with me , which i appreciated , and said the cancer treatment had given me a bit of a kicking			1
' i was suddenly at risk of other diseases so i knew i had to get my act together			2
i wanted to give myself the best possible chance of living			0
' ' i was doing doing three or four intense resistance sessions a week and three rugby sessions			0
i went completely back to basics with my diet and cut out all sugars and fats , eating just lean meats and oily fish , vegetables , fruit and carbohydrate			0
' i suppose in that way the cancer was an eye - opener			2
it forced me to sort my life out and was , i suppose , a bit of a blessing in disguise			0
though it is n't the way i would have chosen to do it , given the choice ! ' speaking about his healthy diet , @entity8 said : ' i went completely back to basics with my diet and cut out all sugars and fats , eating just lean meats and oily fish , vegetables , fruit and carbohydrate			1
and magic happened ' ' one of my biggest motives to change my life was that i wanted to give myself the best possible chance of surviving			0
it was horrible to see my family and my girlfriend , who is now my wife , worrying about me ' @entity8 said : ' i have a very strict , structured regime			1
i prepare most my meals in advance so i never get stuck reading the nutritional content of sandwich packets and unable to eat anything ! ' @entity8 watched the weight fall off and his physical fitness peak			1
but he did n't want to stop there			0
' i started to read more and learn more and instantly see results in myself			2
' but i did n't want to just read and know about it , i wanted to take it to the next level and teach other people about it , so i qualified as a personal trainer in 2010 , which seemed the natural progression			1
' combining his own workouts with personal training , @entity8 works out around eight times a week			1
such a big life transition has not been easy , but @entity8 maintains it with military precision , counting calories and writing down every single thing he has to eat , as well as how much exercise he does			2
doctors at the @entity28 cancer hospital in @entity29 told @entity8 , pictured before the cancer , that treatment had left his body severely weakened and more susceptible to life - threatening diseases such as heart attacks ' i have a very strict , structured regime , ' he said			1
' i prepare most my meals in advance so i never get stuck reading the nutritional content of sandwich packets and unable to eat anything			0
and i use @entity161 , a trusted brand who have a range of products i know will offer exactly what i need			0
breakfast : four - egg omelette made with semi skimmed milk 1 packet oat so simple honey porridge with milk @entity174 flaked almonds 11am : 130g chicken breasts , 350g boiled potatoes boiled , tikka seasoning @entity179 , iceberg lettuce , cherry tomatoes , peppers and beetroot salad 3pm : same meal as at 11am - same as 2 @entity185 7pm rump steak or homemade turkey burger 200g rice or wholemeal muffin salad as above with olive oil or boiled frozen vegetables before bed : mackerel or salmon fillet or eggs pineapple throughout day : bananas and apples as needed ' getting in shape and being healthy is all about diet and nutrition , and it 's not about doing it for a short time , it 's about doing it month - in , month - out			2
' @entity207 and being self - disciplined are the key to results			0
' @entity8 - whose weight dropped to 12st 4lb and whose body turned from fat to muscle - eats about six regimented meals a day , supplemented with fruit			1
and not only does he write down everything he puts in his body , he also logs it onto @entity217 , a mobile app to which his clients have access - so they can see if he slips up			0
' of course i treat myself every now and then			0
i 'm human ! i had a tub of peanut butter and chocolate ice cream at the weekend			0
' but it might be two or three weeks until i have something bad again			0
and it would n't happen every day			0
it 's only when tubs of peanut butter ice cream become the norm that you have to worry			0
' @entity8 has now , thankfully , been given the all - clear from cancer , but he still has an mot once a year to make sure everything stays as it should			1
' one of my biggest motives to change my life was that i wanted to give myself the best possible chance of surviving			0
it was horrible to see my family and my girlfriend , who is now my wife , worrying about me			2
i feel like i had the easy role and they had the difficult one			0
' ' my dad died in between my chemo and radiotherapy treatments , and knowing how much my mum must have gone through			2
if there is anything i can now do to stop that happening again , i will			0
' these days @entity8 is a picture of optimum health , and in a roundabout way credits cancer with giving him the impetus to change			1
he said : ' i 'm a lot happier now that before i had it			0
i guess it kind of sorted me out			0
