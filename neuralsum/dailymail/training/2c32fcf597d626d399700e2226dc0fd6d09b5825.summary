by @entity0 @entity1 was well aware of his son 's struggle with drug addiction and has tried everything to help him , according to a family friend			1
now @entity7 is making sure @entity7 is getting the treatment he needs			0
@entity10 chas entered a rehab facility in @entity12 following his arrest for possession of cocaine on sunday			1
the 20 - year - old was pulled over in his car by the @entity19 sheriff 's deputy while driving in @entity20			1
the illicit drugs were found during a search of the vehicle			0
devoted dad : @entity1 has placed his son in a @entity12 rehab center			1
he says he believes that @entity10 will conquer his addiction the @entity29 star 's son was booked in @entity19 jail and released early on monday morning on $ 10,250 bail			1
@entity7 has since issued a statement , thanking the police for their intervention , while expressing the belief that his son can be a ' recovery success story instead of a cautionary tale			1
' according to sources , @entity10 is receiving treatment for drug addiction at @entity41 in @entity12			1
@entity10 has been to rehab in the past but a family friend says they are hopeful the treatment he will receive at @entity46 will work			2
' @entity47 not only knows about @entity10 's struggles , he 's tried everything , as all parents do , including kicking @entity10 out of the family home , followed by boundaries and tough love			2
none has worked , ' the friend explained			0
the 20 - year - old was pulled over in his car by the @entity19 sheriff 's deputy while driving his car in @entity20 and was arrested for possession of cocaine ' @entity62 may work because it 's got an approach that @entity10 will hopefully not resist			1
@entity10 is his father 's son			1
they both do n't go for controlled orders about praying to a ' god ' for help and the 12 steps , the way @entity7 sees it , is requiring you to believe in @entity75 , and though both @entity77 may believe , they do n't want it forced on them for sobriety purposes			0
@entity62 uses a different model in it 's attempts to help addicts recover that does not involve the 12 steps			0
billed as @entity12 's exclusive alcohol rehabilitation program and drug rehab center , @entity62 says it teaches patients to ' @entity88 ' past celeb patients include @entity90			1
the center offers ' cutting - edge , evidence - based , life - saving , holistic treatment in a luxury estate setting ' , run by ' industry leading professionals '			0
each patient is given a dedicated therapist ' helping you uncover the deep underlying issues that caused addiction in the first place , and healing your mind , body and spirit along the way ' ' that 's why @entity47 put @entity10 in @entity41 , " says the friend			1
but , and there 's a big ' but ' here , @entity10 did n't go into rehab completely willingly			1
' his dad 's lawyers are insisting in hopes of a plea bargain when court time comes			0
this means that since @entity10 is not choosing to get clean on his own but is somewhat forced to , the sobriety may not stick			0
' the friend added that @entity10 has been using drugs for eight years but has n't been able to stay clean			0
' @entity10 's been using drugs and hard drugs as well for eight years so there 's been a million interventions and conversations and threats and aa meetings and sponsors			2
in 2005 , @entity10 appeared in his father 's 2005 film ' @entity133 ' when he was 12 - years - old ' none of it took , for the simple fact that @entity10 enjoys getting high and he found no compelling reason to not get high			2
it has n't effected his health yet , and he 's never going to find himself homeless , penniless and on the streets so the boy has n't hit the preverbial ' bottom			0
' ' it 's a tough road and @entity47 kicked @entity10 out of the house a few years ago , on the tough love principal , and that did n't work , either			2
' after his son 's arrest @entity7 issued a statement , thanking the police for their intervention , while expressing the belief that his son can be a ' recovery success story instead of a cautionary tale			1
'' unfortunately there ’s a genetic component to addiction and @entity10 has likely inherited it			2
' also , there is a lot of family support and understanding , and we ’re all determined to rally behind him and help him become the man he ’s capable of being , ' the 49 - year - old actor said			0
@entity10 is the son of @entity7 and his ex-wife @entity171 , left , pictured in 2007			1
the couple split in 2001 but according to the family friend its now up to @entity10 to give rehab a go			2
' @entity47 does n't feel guilty			0
he knows @entity10 is doing this by choice			0
' i can promise you that @entity47 is blessing those arresting officers because he knew that the only way to help his son at this late stage is for law enforcement to intervene and for @entity10 to get into the legal system			2
' @entity47 also knows that if it takes jail time for @entity10 , so be it			0
right now , @entity47 bailed him out , put him in a $ 45,000 a month rehab in the @entity12 hills , and has given his son the leg up he needs to either make it or break it on his own			1
now , it 's up to @entity10			0
