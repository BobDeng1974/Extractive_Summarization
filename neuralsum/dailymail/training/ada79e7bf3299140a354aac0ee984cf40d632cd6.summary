@entity0 and @entity1 are set to lock horns in the summer pursuit of @entity5 striker @entity4			1
@entity4 hinted strongly last week that he was ready to quit @entity6 just one season after his £ 28million summer move from @entity9			1
he even suggested he would like to return to the @entity10			0
@entity4 could leave @entity6 with @entity1 and @entity0 suitors for the @entity14 striker @entity15 ( right ) made waves at the @entity17 and has continued to turn heads in the @entity19 @entity9 are instead interested in @entity0 's @entity15			1
and if @entity20 quits @entity21 the @entity0 will be in the market for @entity4 and could afford his £ 30m fee with wages at around £ 60,000 a week			1
spurs have lined up @entity27 's @entity26 but if @entity4 is up for grabs then they would change their tact and take on the @entity0			1
@entity30 and @entity31 are two other possible destinations			0
@entity33 will subtly try and convince @entity34 that they are the club for him when he leaves @entity35 as a free agent this summer			1
@entity34 is able to talk to foreign clubs and it has been reported that he has flown out for talks with @entity40			1
sociedad boss @entity41 is hoping to secure 22 - year - old @entity34 on a pre-contract worth £ 60,000 - a - week and a significant signing on fee			1
@entity33 are capable of rewarding him well too but they ca n't officially approach the player until the summer unless they strike a deal with @entity35 which would involve some form of fee			1
@entity33 will try to convince @entity34 to head to @entity49 at the end of the season @entity52 has insisted that @entity53 is part of @entity56 's future			1
but it is understood the @entity58 is ready to quit @entity59 this summer and move to @entity60 despite being recently quoted that he is ' happy ' at @entity56			1
@entity60 are the club @entity62 wanted to join last summer when he was off loaded by @entity63			2
but complications with regard to @entity67 regulations prevented the @entity69 club completing a £ 55 million deal			0
@entity53 's spell at @entity56 has been an indifferent one and @entity60 are rumoured to be keen the @entity69 club had targeted @entity9 's @entity73 for this summer			1
the @entity14 recently signed a new five - and - a - half - year deal with the @entity10 and @entity60 will move in for @entity62 who has not settled into the @entity56 team			2
@entity56 now look as though they will not take up their option to sign @entity77 , on loan from @entity79 , on a permanent deal			0
@entity77 could return to the south of @entity69 although there is a possibility of a trade with @entity60 to bring @entity86 front man @entity85 to @entity59			0
@entity73 put pen to paper on a new deal to keep him at @entity9 for the foreseeable future @entity91 turned down the offer of managing @entity93 last week to pave the way for succeeding @entity95 as @entity97 boss			1
@entity97 confirmed the @entity99 deal on saturday after sacking @entity95			2
it had appeared @entity91 was a shoo - in to replace @entity100 at @entity101 and talks had taken place			2
but @entity91 had some reservations given the potential financial punishments from the @entity106 the club could face if they are relegated , plus the risk of a decaying squad			2
@entity91 is the new @entity97 manager after he turned down @entity93 's advances @entity95 was sacked from his position as the manager of @entity97 on wednesday there was also the issue of seemingly being seen as part of a ' consipiracy ' to oust @entity100 given @entity91 's close relationship with @entity93 's director of football @entity118 , both of whom worked under @entity100 at @entity1			1
and as soon as the @entity97 job became vacant @entity91 , who despite only a short stint as @entity1 boss has suddenly become managerial ' hot property ' , saw a better route to establish himself in football management			2
despite woeful recent form @entity97 have a far stronger squad than @entity101 and @entity91 is confident he can steer the club out of the relegation zone			2
it is understood @entity132 , who quit as @entity93 coach when @entity100 resigned , could work as a part - time assistant with @entity91 at @entity135			1
meanwhile @entity136 , who has been given the @entity101 job until the end of the season , believes he can do the job on a permanent basis , but that will only happen if he steers @entity93 to survival			2
@entity136 though has been told he still has a long - term role at the club @entity136 , known throughout the game as a fine coach , has the chance to keep the @entity93 up i am hearing ... @entity27 , who missed out on @entity151 on transfer deadline day , will move for the @entity0 striker again this summer			1
but if @entity154 secure promotion they will also chase @entity151 , who suddenly has a role to play again with the @entity0 given that @entity157 is out of action for the rest of the season			1
the @entity27 are also keen on @entity0 's @entity161			1
@entity151 ( right ) exploded with rage at @entity163 after missing out on a move to @entity27 i am also hearing ... @entity1 , in a bid for long - term stability and success have already tied @entity168 and @entity169 down to new , lucrative contracts , and expect to secure the services of 20 - year - old @entity173 midfielder @entity172 soon			1
@entity174 has been a regular for @entity176 's exciting @entity1 side btw it was great to catch up with @entity178 last week			2
sir @entity179 was guest of honour in @entity181 , @entity182 at a dinner held by @entity184 , a fine @entity185 charity which works across the board in north east @entity188 and @entity189 communities to help those people who have lose their way in the world due to addictions and family issues			0
as ever tales of yore had guests transfixed during a q&a			0
i had to ask @entity178 which goal was his favourite , the one for @entity202 vs @entity203 which ensured qualification for the 1982 @entity17 , a solo winner in @entity0 's epic 3 - 1 @entity208 semi final win over @entity209 or his headed winner in the 1980 fa cup final			1
not surprisingly he plumped for the latter even though i tried to convince him about the goal against @entity209 , which was a classic game in the mud which you no longer see			0
@entity178 celebrates with his @entity0 team - mates after scoring in the @entity219 final @entity178 was pretty open in some of his answers but understandably was coy about the real reason from his departure as the @entity211 's technical director			1
my understanding was that after 10 years he got rather fed up of making suggestions based on football reasons , and eventually saw the commercial imperative take priority and a new breed of clip board coaches take over at the core of the @entity211 coaching staff			0
in the latest restructuring at @entity234 there is a man called @entity236 who never played the game professionally but who is in charge of the @entity211 's @entity240 based at @entity241 ' , s a role which effectively rendered @entity178 's position redundant			2
no doubt @entity236 's sports science @entity244 ticks all the right boxes but when there are so many ex-pros with coaching credentials and streetwise savvy it still seems a strange appointment			2
certainly the workings of this new department would seem in need of urgent scrutiny given that on friday night @entity202 's @entity254 ( full of @entity19 academy players ) lost 7 - 0 … yes seven … to @entity256 in a tournament in the @entity258			2
sir @entity178 ( left ) now occupies the role of director of football development in @entity202 @entity261 @entity19 supremo @entity262 was right when he said football clubs are not charities			0
but they are a massive part of their local communities			0
and he should remember in hard times local communities have usually clubbed together , dug deep into their pockets , to bail out clubs in financial crisis and offered their own form of charity to save clubs from going to the wall			0
it 's not just smaller professional or @entity280 clubs where this happens			0
so while at the moment the plight of @entity283 might not seem of consequence to the people at the top of the game ( but it should ) let 's not forget that one of the @entity19 's fat cat 's @entity9 had to set up the ' save the @entity292 ' to keep it afloat in the @entity293 and @entity294			1
indeed as a consequence of that the commendable @entity296 still has an influential voice at the club			0
the @entity19 will continue to be shown on @entity299 and @entity300 until 2019 in a £ 5.136bn deal and they , along with other similar groups , will argue that following the massive increase in tv rights revenues announced by the @entity19 last week the time has come for top clubs not just to freeze ticket prices but reduce them			0
the fact prices have become so high means that the ' normal working man ' and many youngsters just have n't been able to afford to attend			0
they have in effect become the tv customers rather than in - stadia supporters			0
but the game is in danger of losing a generation of fans who are used to turning up at matches and down the line grounds with empty seats is not good for business			0
not so much in terms of revenue but creating the event and making the atmosphere that makes the @entity19 so attractive to tv at home and abroad			0
so cutting prices would not be an act of a charity but an investment in the long - term future of the game or in @entity19 parlance the ' product			0
' @entity262 agreed a huge television deal and said that @entity19 clubs are not charities @entity341 it 's getting to that time when people will start talking about who should be the @entity346			0
it would seem to me @entity349 are calling it right at the moment with @entity352 3 - 1 fav			0
@entity73 and @entity354 are 11 - 2 , @entity353 is is 4 - 1 and @entity355 is 11 - 2 .			0

@entity4 has hinted he is willing to leave @entity6
@entity9 want @entity0 's lively @entity358 @entity15
@entity33 will try to twist @entity34 ' *arm* to come to @entity49
@entity53 is ready to quit @entity362 and head across @entity363
@entity91 turned down @entity93 to become @entity95 's successor
@entity27 will move for @entity0 striker @entity151 again this summer
