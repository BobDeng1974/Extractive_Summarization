coffee and sleep are top of most people ’s minds as they stumble through the monday morning commute			0
but now tired workers up and down the country no longer have to choose between the two			0
in fact , drinking coffee 20 minutes or less before you wake could make you more alert after your nap			1
dubbed the ‘ coffee nap ’ , researchers claim that a cup of coffee before a quick power nap heightens the impact of caffeine on the brain			1
dubbed the ‘ coffee nap ’ , researchers claim that drinking coffee then having a quick power nap heightens the impact of caffeine on the brain when someone drinks coffee , caffeine is absorbed through the small intestine and passes into the bloodstream , according to a report by @entity27 in @entity28			1
here , it crosses into the brain where it locks into receptors that are normally filled by a similarly - shaped molecule , called adenosine			2
@entity35 is what is responsible for natural tiredness			0
when it binds to receptors , it causes drowsiness by slowing down nerve cell activity			1

when it binds to receptors , it causes drowsiness by slowing down nerve cell activity			1
but when caffeine locks to the receptors , it speeds up the nerve cells			0
the process from drinking a cup of coffee to feelings its affects takes around 20 minutes			1
the thinking behind the coffee nap is that sleeping naturally clears adenosine from the brain			1
this means napping for 20 minutes will reduce your levels of adenosine just in time for the caffeine to work			2

while scientists have n’t seen this work in real - time , they have conducted a number of studies in the @entity103 and @entity104 to see its implications			0
for instance , researchers at @entity107 found that when tired participants took a 15 - minute coffee nap , they went on to made fewer errors in a driving simulator , even if they had trouble falling asleep			0
a separate study found coffee naps can help people go for long periods without proper sleep			2
in one experiment , 24 young men went without proper sleep for a 24 - hour period , taking only short naps			0
the half who had coffee naps performed better in tests that the other half who were given a placebo before their naps .			0

studies in @entity104 and @entity134 say coffee naps improve *memory*
this is because coffee binds to receptors normally filled by adenosine
@entity35 is responsible for tiredness and slows nerve cell activity
sleeping naturally clears the adenosine molecule from the brain
caffeine takes 20 minutes to kick in , so a power nap just after drinking coffee can help keep people alert
