by @entity0 an 11 - year - old girl created a dress made out of 25,000 loom bands and sold it on @entity4 for £ 155			1
@entity5 from @entity6 , @entity7 , spent seven days creating the multi-coloured garment made entirely from £ 90 worth of the popular rubber bracelets			1
however , where @entity11 and @entity12 , from @entity13 , @entity14 , managed to flog an almost identical dress last week for £ 170,000 on @entity4 , @entity5 ’s dress went under the hammer for just £ 155			1
her parents @entity31 , 33 , and dad @entity32 , 42 , are proud of her for making an adult size ten dress from the colourful bands			1
yesterday mrs @entity5 , a trainee teacher , said : ‘ i still ca n’t believe how someone so young can show so much dedication			1
‘ she has been getting home from school and getting on with it straight away			0
‘ she really has been non-stop			0
whether it is in the car , while watching tv or having dinner , she is looming			0
intricate : @entity5 , 11 , from @entity13 , @entity14 , made the dress over seven days ‘ i am really proud of her			1
i ca n’t put it into words how i feel			0
she is just a star , she really is			0
’ the @entity50 believe their daughter is the first youngster to make a dress from loom bands			1
mrs @entity5 said making the dress had taken a lot of hard work			1
she said : ‘ she is so proud of her work			0
it has just boosted her confidence really			0
she was so determined to do it			0
‘ she has always enjoyed crafts and loom bands bring the creativity out of children			1
’ @entity5 thanked her family for the support			1
she said : ‘ i am really pleased with how it has turned out and that it did n’t go horribly wrong			0
‘ everyone i have told about the dress have been really impressed and ca n’t believe i made it			2
‘ but most importantly , my family have been the greatest throughout because they gave me the £ 90 to make this dress and have supported me all the way			1
’ @entity5 auctioned off the colourful garment to raise money for a family holiday			2
she said she wanted to raise at least £ 50 cash so she could give her four - year - old brother @entity81 £ 10 , keep £ 20 for her to spend in the arcades and £ 20 for a fish and chips dinner treat while on holiday in @entity86 , @entity87 , next month			0
she also wanted to raise money for her old @entity90 pack , the 3rd @entity91			0
but the dress exceeded her expectations and fetched £ 155			1
the artistic youngster is not sick of loom bands just yet and she now wants to make a bag out of them			2
while the craze for loom bands is keeping plenty of children occupied , it 's bad news for wildlife experts have warned that fish and sea birds could be under threat - from loom bands			2
conservationists from the @entity111 are worried marine life could die after eating the tiny elastic bands used to make the popular bracelets			0
staff at the aquarium in @entity117 , @entity118 , asked children to leave the rubber fashion accessories at home when they head to the beach and take care when getting rid of them			0
@entity125 , the @entity111 director of conservation said : ' loom bands , like any plastic item , are capable of persisting in the environment for many , many years and there is abundant evidence of small plastic items making their way into the diets of marine animals and seabirds with tragic consequences			1
' while we would n’t want to single out loom bands as a specific threat , its true that they will become an issue if we let them get into the seas			2
' taking care with storage , use and when absolutely necessary , their disposal should ensure that they can be enjoyed without becoming a threat to wildlife			0
' i ’d be particularly worried about loom bands being taken to the beach as , not only is the likelihood of them getting into the sea so much higher there but there are also so many better things to do at the beach			2

@entity5 , 11 , spent seven days making the dress from scratch
she used £ 90 worth of bands and sold it on for £ 155 on @entity4
last week a loom dress sold for £ 170k but the winning *bidder* pulled out
