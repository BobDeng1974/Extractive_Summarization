by @entity0 @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity3 are pop 's poster girls well known for their penchant for glossy , highlighted and sometimes even rainbow locks , bronzed skin and perfect feline flicks			0
but it seems the trio have ditched their make - up bags and are fully embracing the @entity15 ' make - under ' trend that dominated the catwalks this season			1
@entity2 wowed at the @entity18 on sunday with a more pared - back look than we are accustomed to			1
@entity1 , meanwhile , sported minimal make - up and wore her hair au natural when she joined sister @entity23 at @entity24 this weekend and @entity3 stripped off her much - loved heavy make - up for a friend 's wedding			2
writing on @entity37 , @entity36 says : ' it 's the latest sign that @entity2 's decided to switch to a more grown - up look			2
' the singer who used to shock in her videos on the red carpet with multi-coloured wigs and skimpy hemlines has been little - by - little paring down her image over the past year			2
she even shared a no - makeup selfie on @entity47 last month			0
' it seems for stars known for their outlandish looks , the best way to make a statement is to ditch the cartoon - like image			0
' even @entity54 @entity1 has jumped on the trend ! @entity1 was seen at @entity24 wearing minimal make - up and natural hair - ( left ) a different look from her usual ultra-polished style ( right ) beauty blogger @entity60 said : ' it ’s amazing to see @entity2 in something of a new light			1
using make - up is all about being creative and expressing yourself and i think it ’s great that she is showing us another side to her character through a more natural look			0
' i do n’t know if she ’s necessarily trying to shock or rebel but rather just prove that she ’s got more to offer than the bright colours and wild hairstyles			0
has she gone ga - ga ? @entity3 ditched her heavy make - up look and looks flawless in the process ' there always seems to be a move towards more bare - faced make - up during the spring and summer seasons and these ladies prove that @entity85 is all about the new take on natural			0
' while each season presents an updated take on ' natural ' beauty , designers for @entity85 sent their models out wearing near to no make - up at all			1
dubbed ' raw ' beauty by all the make - up maestros backstage , a touch of concealer and swash of bronzer or blusher was used to highlight the skin rather than transform it			1
speaking about the fresh , contemporary look , stylist @entity101 said : ' doing as little as possible but still looking good is the most modern thing that you can do right now			0
' raw : while each season presents an updated take on ' natural ' beauty and @entity85 catwalks were awash with the barely - there beauty look			1
