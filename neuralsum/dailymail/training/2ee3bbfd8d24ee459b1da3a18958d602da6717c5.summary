by @entity0 published : 05:41 est , 24 december 2012 updated : 07:42 est , 24 december 2012 they may be more accustomed to patrolling the beat , but one police force has shown that it does n’t have the @entity4 when it comes to trying to sing along in time to it			2
@entity8 users have slammed @entity10 ’s ‘ tragic ’ cover version of @entity12 ’s 1973 anthem @entity11 – the not very catchily named ‘ @entity13 ’			1
the force had hoped that the song would offer residents winter crime advice but it is unlikely to trouble the frontrunners for the number one spot over the festive period			1
although it did n't cost the @entity25 anything to produce , some residents have taken to @entity8 and @entity26 to question whether putting the song together was an appropriate use of employees time			1
scroll down for audio rip off : @entity10 has attempted to spread its seasonal crime prevention message by re-writing festive anthem @entity11 by @entity12 , pictured performing in 1973 communications staff at the force came up with the novel idea as part of its focus on driving down burglary			1
instead of using the song 's traditional lyrics , the team penned a version of their own			1
their version of the song includes such lines as : ‘ it ’s a time when every burglar has a ball , have you locked the upstairs window ? ' are the keys left by the door ? have you turned the lights on so that they ’re not sure ? ’ in place of the famous refrain ' what would you do if you saw your mother kissing @entity61 ? ' is a cringeworthy plug for the force 's crime prevention website			1
and instead of @entity67 's rasping vocals , police project analyst @entity65 took to the microphone			2
and not everyone was impressed with @entity25 's songwriting skills			1
it 's a no from me : @entity8 user @entity73 did his best @entity75 impression to pan the @entity77 crime reduction song unimpressed : although @entity8 user @entity78 thought that the idea was good , he said the lack of money used for producing the song showed not a fan : @entity84 questioned how much time the police force had spent on the song thumbs up : not everyone disliked the @entity90 tune			1
@entity91 complimented @entity25 on their festive song @entity73 took to the force @entity8 page to say : ‘ well all i 'm gon na say is @entity75 would not be impressed at all			1
’ ( sic ) @entity95 described the version as : ' @entity97 '			2
are you hanging up a stocking on your wall ? it 's the time when every burglar has a ball , have you locked the upstairs window ? the key is by the door , have you turned a light on so that they are n't sure ? so here it is crime reduction , it 's advice that you can use , put off those burglars , make sure they 're the ones to losehave you locked all the doors before you leave ? do n't leave your presents on display for them to thievehave you seen anything suspiciousthat you maybe should report ? get on the phone to us so they 'll get @entity121 here it is crime reduction , it 's advice that you can use , put off those burglars , make sure they 're the ones to losevisit our website for tips and advice and sign up to ringmasteraaaahaaaaahave you marked up all your stuff with your postcode ? have you registered it on the @entity131 in case it goes ? for a @entity136 's @entity135 to a property marking @entity134 'll be one near you to bring the gifts that you 've been @entity140 here it is crime reduction , it 's advice that you can use , put off those burglars , make sure they 're the ones to lose @entity144 took to @entity26 to claim that @entity25 had ' ruined @entity90 , while @entity78 added : ' i just died a little inside			2
' @entity84 questioned how many hours of police staff time were used to produce the song			0
but the @entity90 spirit was n't lost on everyone			0
@entity91 tweeted : ' good song			0
gets the message clearly across			0
' @entity152 , @entity153 at @entity10 said : ' the idea came around last year as we looked to promote crime prevention advice during the @entity90 period			1
' it is a bit of fun but the message behind it is very clear			0
' we want people to have a very @entity90 without becoming the victims of crime			0
. ' the song is n’t available to buy as we want as many people as possible to hear it free of charge			0
' the song did n't cost the force as the recording session was donated for free			0
@entity10 is n't the only emergency service to find novelty ways of reducing crime and promoting community safety this winter			1
the county 's fire service also decided to show off its lyrical skills by producing its own version of rocking around the @entity181			2
the catchy tune 's reworked words go : ' rocking around the christmas tree , do n’t make the fire bells ring out ! ' test your smoke alarm every week , do n’t take the batteries out			0
' @entity189 were slated earlier this month for tweeting lyrics warning motorists that roads were slippy in the style of @entity195 's @entity194 '			0
meanwhile , creative @entity197 cops in @entity198 , @entity199 , sent out a @entity90 card to well know criminals asking whether they would be on @entity203 's naughty or nice list next year			0
the card featured the local police chief dressed up as @entity61 and clutching an automatic weapon			0

@entity10 has recorded its own version of the @entity12 festive *classic* @entity11
but not everyone is impressed with their *musical* effort with one @entity8 user describing it as ' tragic '
