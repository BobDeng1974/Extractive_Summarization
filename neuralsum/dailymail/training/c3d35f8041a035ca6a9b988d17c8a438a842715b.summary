a grand jury has decided not to charge anyone in an alleged sexual assault near @entity4 that was photographed and filmed by witnesses , a prosecutor said monday			1
@entity7 prosecutor @entity6 said the grand jury determined there was n't probable cause to file charges after a man and woman were photographed in a sex act against the front window of a bank near the southern @entity4 campus in the early hours of october 12			1
explicit photos of the two were circulated via social media , and the woman later told police she was a victim of a sexual assault			1
warning : @entity24 tweeted : the photo @entity26 posted , which @entity27 has cropped , shows the man kneeling down and performing a sex act on the woman against a wall investigators determined the couple , both 20 - year - old students , had alcohol from a bar before the sex act , @entity6 said in a statement monday			1
@entity6 said the man asked the woman whether to stop the act when a crowd formed , and she said no. the man has cooperated with police			1
the woman did n't remember what happened , and testing showed no sign of any ' date rape drug , ' @entity6 said			1
he said the couple was n't aware at the time that their act was being filmed			2
' every decision we make now has the potential to be placed on @entity55 , @entity56 , commented on , shared and embellished , making life today more public than ever before , ' @entity6 said in the statement			0
' if a lesson exists from this case , let it be that we should behave as if our family is always watching			0
' spreading the word : @entity55 and @entity65 users posted about the alleged incident not knowing that the woman has since reported it to police as a sexual assault university president @entity71 had said the school would conduct its own investigation and , if appropriate , would take action to hold people accountable			1
he said that some of the response within the university community had been divisive and that he hoped instead it would inspire greater caring at the campus about 70 miles southeast of @entity82			0
the video and picture quickly became a national news story , provoking outrage at those who did not intervene and some bloggers it seems started hunting for the woman - claiming that she had only filed a sexual assault suit because she was embarrassed at the footage			1
however , not only did the shameful web users go after the potential victim of a sexual assault - they also identified the wrong girl			1
journalism student , @entity96 , was wrongly named on @entity55 as the woman in the now notorious images and video of a girl being pinned against a wall while a man performed oral sex as passers - by only stopped to film it			2
incorrectly identified : @entity96 was falsely named as the alleged victim of a sexual assault on october 12th at @entity108 that was filmed and uploaded to the internet @entity111 : this is the tweet that named @entity96 as the girl involved in the rape claim after she was filmed on the street at the @entity4 homecoming @entity96 was named by @ @entity118 — a popular @entity55 account with over 170,000 followers as the alleged victim days after the incident and was accused of being a ' liar ' only interested in saving her own ' ass '			1
however , @entity96 has come forward to explain that she is ' 100 percent ' not the woman involved and that she was nowhere near the incident at @entity126 , 2 s. court st. , on saturday , october 12th			2
police officers have also confirmed that she was not involved			0
one of the individuals who stood and videoed the incident was named and shamed by the @entity27 earlier this month			0
@entity26 , 19 , tweeted the image the morning after with the caption : ' so i witnessed this the other night			0
' @entity26 sent it to @ @entity137 , who is the man behind the notorious now shuttered ' @entity140 ? shame : @entity26 , a 19 - year - old college student , is one of those being criticized for failing to step in and act while the alleged sexual assault was occuring			1
instead he 's among a handful of people who posted pictures online he also tweeted it at @entity148 , a user who goes by the name of @entity151 who seems to be an @entity4 student who puts on parties			2
when the story went viral blanc was initially belligerent and tweeted : ' you do n't wan na get embarrassed ? do n't do stupid shit			0
' he later took down the image and apologized , claiming to be ' ashamed			0
' the explicit photos of the alleged assault were taken and shared on social media after the college homecoming celebration			1
the woman seen receiving oral sex in the photos and videos reportedly had no idea what happened to her until the next morning when she saw the photos online			2
many of the photos of incident have been taken down by the @entity65 users who originally posted them , but news sites like @entity177 republished them			0
the woman in the photos contacted the police the day after the incident and reported that she had been a victim of sexual assault to the @entity7 police department			1
close for comfort : the photos suggest the alleged sexual assault took place against the @entity126 on @entity188 which is about a block away from the police department in one of the most graphic photos - which shows the man kneeling in front of the woman as she leans against a @entity126 bank - makes it clear that there were onlookers just feet away from the incident as it was in progress			1
@entity26 was n't the only one to witness the incident			0
' still can believe a dude was * * * * * * * * * on court street saturday night in front of like 10 people , ' a different @entity55 user wrote			0
not only was the scene of the alleged crime a busy street but it was also one block away from the police station			0
while police were still investigating the case , the community was already going on the attack			0
' some of us are really angered and disappointed that no one intervened and they just filmed it , ' @entity218 , a student at @entity4 who leads an anti-rape group on campus , said at the time			2
' their first impulse was to share it on social media and make a mockery of something that was probably the worst thing that ’s ever happened to her			2
there are other people who saw it as her asking for it and think it ’s a joke			0
basically they 're slut - shaming her for what happened , ' she said according to @entity240			0
' the response on social media is kind of heartbreaking , how harsh and cruel people are being			2
