these incredible photographs show dogs hard at work in the most dangerous job in the world - clearing mines in the war fields of @entity7			1
the mines are a legacy of the @entity10 invasion of @entity7 in the 1980s and children are particularly vulnerable to the blasts when they go out to play or tend to their herds of cattle			1
mine detection teams work with the highly - trained dogs , typically @entity19 or @entity20 shepherds , to find and neutralise the lethal explosives in the @entity22 of @entity7			1
the devices are destroyed in controlled explosions once they 've been found ( right ) the mines are a legacy of the @entity10 invasion of @entity7 in the 1980 's the heroic dogs are from the @entity32 and funding comes from government donations around the world and international charities the dogs are selected as puppies based on health and their fixation on a rubber ball , which is used as a reward for them during the mine - hunting sessions the humbling and inspirational pictures were taken by @entity47 , a 40 - year - old former @entity49 bomb disposal expert who has been working in explosive ordnance disposal and mine action since 1999			1
@entity47 has served in @entity53 , @entity7 , @entity54 , @entity55 , and @entity56 and has been stationed in @entity7 since january 2014			2
he said : ' some mines are intentionally designed with minimum metal to make detection difficult			2
' dogs can search much faster than a person with a detector , especially in areas where mine contamination is low			1
this is particularly helpful in reducing the total size of a suspected area			0
' the humbling and inspirational pictures were taken by @entity47 , a 40 - year - old former @entity49 bomb disposal expert devices found in @entity7 : ( from the left ) the @entity74 @entity73 antitank blast mine - minimum metal and hard to detect - the @entity77 @entity76 antipersonnel blast mine and finally a @entity77 @entity76 antitank mine , perhaps the most abundant mine on @entity80 the mines are often buried several inches into soil , making them extra hard to detect the dogs are used because they can normally find mines much more quickly than humans can , even if they have a detector an unidentified mine - hunter kneels down next to an unexploded device that he 's found buried in the ground those tending to farmyard animals in the countryside are particularly vulnerable to minefields these heroic dogs are from the @entity32 and funding comes from government donations around the world and international charities			1
they are selected as puppies based on health and their fixation on a rubber ball			0
this rubber ball is the reward for all their hard work			2
the handler will start the dog in a warm - up box , then show the dog where to start based on wind direction and previous cleared areas			0
the dogs then know to sniff along in a straight line searching for the explosives			0
when the dog reaches the end , it is called back and their progress is marked with coloured flags			0
the process will continue until all the fields are cleared of mines			0
after the mines are found they are destroyed in a controlled explosion .			0
