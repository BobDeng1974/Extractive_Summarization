former @entity1 manager @entity0 has praised @entity2 for making an impact at @entity4 - but he maintains @entity5 was given little chance of succeeding			1
@entity2 has put @entity1 in the driving seat for second place in the @entity9 and a place in the semi-finals of the play - offs after taking over from reluctant caretaker @entity13			1
@entity5 was put on gardening leave just before @entity15 after handing in his notice following three - and - a - half difficult seasons in charge under the chaotic reigns of the likes of @entity21 and then @entity22 and his allies			1
but his failure to win a cup competition and his team 's style of play drew serious criticism			2
@entity0 ( right ) spent two spells in charge as manager of @entity1 and has hailed @entity2 's impact @entity0 ( right ) attended a @entity35 golf day to raise money for testicular cancer awareness @entity0 was chairman for some of that period after accepting @entity22 's offer to join the board - a decision he soon regretted - and insists the club was too badly run to ensure true success on the park			1
@entity0 , who was attending a @entity35 golf day to help raise money for testicular cancer awareness , said : ' the guys worked with me for four - and - a - half years there and did a great job for the club , and i was hoping they would get a good opportunity			2
' i got great support from sir @entity53 but it 's not turned out that they have had the same support from the people who have been running the club			2
so it has been very difficult for them to show what they can do			0
' that 's the crux of the matter , it 's the circumstances they have been in that have caused them as much trouble as anything else			0
' i 'd be very surprised if anybody could show me a club that is n't well run , that are doing really well			0
' the problems have been well documented and now they have got to concentrate on doing what they do , and that 's @entity1 getting back to the @entity75 first and foremost and then trying to settle into a position where they can get back to being a winning team			1
' @entity2 played under @entity0 for seven seasons , winning six titles in the process , and the 67 - year - old was pleased to see the former @entity84 boss take over , despite his pain at the exits of former assistants @entity5 and @entity13			1
@entity2 was appointed @entity1 manager in march until the summer as a replacement for @entity13 ' i 'm not happy to see it because it cost friends of mine their job , ' he said			1
' but that happens in football and when other people take over i am obviously pleased to see @entity2 take over and i hope he does really well			2
' he has been brave enough to take the job until the end of the season			0
if he gets promotion , he will put himself in a very good position to get the job on a more permanent basis			0
' he has gone in there and got a reaction			0
it has happened to me and a whole load of other managers , when you leave and someone else comes in , they get a reaction			0
rangers have won five out of nine @entity9 matches since @entity2 's arrival at @entity4 ' performances have been brighter and hopefully he will keep that going until the end of the season			1
' however , @entity0 has warned that @entity1 fans might have to be patient in their desire to see the club competing at the very top of @entity128 football , despite power now lying in the hands of the likes of @entity132 and @entity133 following last month 's general meeting			1
' i 'm obviously happy to see everything at the club settling down , ' the former @entity136 boss said			0
' the lack of headlines would indicate that 's the case			0
' the people that are running the club are just getting their feet under the table and finding out what they have to do to move the club forward			0
i think that 's to be expected at this stage			0
@entity0 did , however , open up about @entity5 's departure and admitted it was n't easy to see ' it will obviously take a bit of time but they will be able to handle that aspect of it			1
everyone who is there now is there for the football club and that 's a big , big thing			0
' to be fair , when i was involved on the @entity1 board , it would have been different from any other boardroom never mind anything else			2
' i have been fortunate enough to be at @entity1 for a long time and be there at successful times and it 's not a period i can look back on with any great pleasure			1
