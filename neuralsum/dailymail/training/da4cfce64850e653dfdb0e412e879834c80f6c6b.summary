by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 11 january 2014 updated : 17:00 est , 11 january 2014 it was me ! @entity4 , now retired , said his £ 10 haircuts inspired @entity7 's locks a spat has erupted between two top hairstylists over who switched the prime minister ’s parting to the left			1
stylist - to - the stars @entity15 – awarded an mbe in the @entity18 for services to hairdressing – has been widely credited for giving @entity7 ’s locks the distinctive new look			1
but the @entity12 ’s previous barber , @entity4 , says the suggestion is rubbish and that it was he who gave the pm his look back in 2007			1
mr @entity4 – who charged the @entity28 leader £ 10 per trim , as opposed to the £ 90 mr @entity7 currently pays – said : ‘ it ’s annoying to say the least			1
i ’m sure mr @entity15 deserves his mbe but the publicity he ’s had from that side parting over the years must have helped			1
' he may not have made the claim himself but he ’s never denied it			0
yet it is completely wrong			0
my daughter is furious and i ’m getting calls from friends saying , " @entity4 , you ’ve been stitched up			1
" ’ mr @entity4 , 63 , who is now retired but ran his @entity41 salon with wife @entity42 , 66 , said he remembered the day he gave the pm parting advice			1
‘ i ’ve always had a wonderful eye for the way people have their hair , ’ he said			2
‘ that particular day i said , “ mr @entity7 , you ’re wearing your hair on the wrong side			2
it ’s making your face look very , very long			0
” ‘ his hair grows from left to right so if you comb it to go the opposite way , as he did , it sticks up			0
so i changed it and told him to look in the mirror and say which he liked best			0
‘ he agreed with me so i swept it from left to right , which flattened the top and pushed it down quite nicely			0
‘ i was glad he took my advice and i ’m pleased it still suits him			0
but i feel a bit like a film double			0
i did the work and some star gets the credit			2
’ honoured : although he never claimed so himself , @entity7 's current stylist @entity15 ( left ) has been widely credit with creating the prime minister 's signature parting			1
he has been honoured with an @entity74 mr @entity4 , who arrived in @entity75 from @entity76 in 1958 , says he had many celebrity clients because his @entity79 salon had a discreet entrance			1
he and his wife have now retired to @entity82			0
mrs @entity83 said : ‘ it is important to put the record straight			0
in fact we cut all the @entity7 family ’s hair			2
’ mr @entity15 , whose client list includes @entity92 and @entity93 , is a consultant at upmarket @entity96 salon @entity94			2
he has styled mr @entity7 ’s hair for the past five years but it is understood he was not nominated for his award by the pm			2
mr @entity15 - whose 30 - year career has been hailed as ‘ an inspiration to the industry ’ by colleagues - believes he was honoured for his campaign to get hairdressing recognised as a profession			1
asked about his approach to the @entity12 ’s hairstyle he said : ‘ i just did what felt natural			0
’ however , mr @entity4 remains unconvinced			1
‘ i see mr @entity7 on tv and i ’m not sure about his hair , ’ he said			1
‘ i do n’t think he ’s looking after it as well as he could			0

@entity4 said his £ 10 cuts were the ones that gave @entity7 his new look
but credit has widely been given to £ 90 - a - cut star stylist @entity15
mr @entity4 , 63 : ' i ’m getting calls saying , " @entity4 , you ’ve been stitched up " '
