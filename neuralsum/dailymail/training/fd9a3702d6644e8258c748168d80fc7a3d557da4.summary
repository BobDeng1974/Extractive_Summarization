by @entity1 reporter published : 03:02 est , 29 august 2013 updated : 03:09 est , 29 august 2013 a pint of beer costs up to 65p more in the south of @entity5 than it does in the north			2
a survey by the @entity8 showed drinkers in @entity10 enjoy the cheapest ale at an average of just £ 2.95 a pint while those in @entity15 are forced to fork out £ 3.60			1
drinkers in @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 can all raise a toast to enjoying prices of little over £ 3 a pint			1
hard to swallow : beer drinkers are forking out 65p more for a pint in @entity15 than they do in @entity10 but boozers in @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 must drown their sorrows with the knowledge they are being forced to fork out far above the national average of £ 3.20			1
beer brewed by pubs themselves , on the premises , typically cost 40p a pint less than the local average , the guide found			1
@entity8 spokesman @entity42 told the @entity43 : ' people in @entity10 have an eye for value and some licencees go to great lengths looking for bargains for customers			1
@entity10 , known for its beautiful canals and potteries , sells some of the cheapest beer in @entity54 with pints costing an average of £ 2.95 ' in the @entity58 , big brewers used to own most pubs , which tended to limit the competition			1
' but i think people in the @entity58 are simply less careful with their money			2
' the guide predicts that around 4,000 pubs will close in the next year because they are ' stuck in the 1980s ' , offering indifferent drink and food , according to a new guide			2
more than 1,000 new pubs are expected to open , often in former hostelries which have been shuttered for years			0
between 2,500 and 4,000 will go out of business , but the guide quotes a successful landlord saying there are too many pubs in the wrong place , chasing the wrong market			0
watering hole : the @entity79 pub in @entity80 , @entity81 , was named @entity82 ' the bad pubs are still being culled , just like lions pick off the slowest of the herd			0
it makes the pub industry more robust and far better placed for the future , ' he said			0
the guide said standards are improving in pubs , amid increasing vocational training among staff , but it called for pubs to name their chefs on menus as part of moves to close the " absurd status gap " between tv chefs and those working in pubs			0
when the guide was launched in 1983 there were a handful of national beer brands , but now more than 7,000 beers are on offer , produced by hundreds of brewers			2
the @entity111 was named as the @entity79 in @entity80 , @entity81 , with other awards including the best landlord ( @entity114 of the @entity115 in @entity116 , @entity117 ) , brewery ( @entity119 ) , new pub ( @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 ) , dining pub ( @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 ) and whisky pub ( @entity129 , @entity130 )			0
more than 4,700 pubs are featured in the guide .			0

drinkers in @entity10 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity134 enjoy the cheapest ale
but those in @entity15 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 are *paying* well above the national average of £ 3.20 a pint
