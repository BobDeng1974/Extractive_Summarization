it ’s been said that music is a universal language , and now a new study claims that it really does cut across cultures			2
researchers found that whether you are a pygmy in the @entity10 rainforest or a hipster in @entity12 , aspects of music move us in the same way			1
certain combinations of notes from popular pieces of music heard in films , for example , made people from different cultures feel similarly calm or excited			1
researchers found that whether you are a pygmy in the @entity10 rainforest or a hipster in @entity12 , aspects of music move us in the same way , making us either feel excited ( illustrated with a stock image ) or calm researchers from @entity28 , the @entity29 and @entity30 in @entity31 , @entity32 , came to their conclusion after travelling deep into the rainforest to play music to @entity35 - an isolated group of people without access to radio , tv or electricity			1
they compared how the @entity35 responded both to their own and to unfamiliar @entity41 music , as well as the way that a group of @entity32 reacted to the same pieces			1
the team discovered that although the groups felt differently about whether specific pieces of music made them feel good or bad , they agreed upon whether the music made them feel calm or excited , according to the journal @entity51			1
in the experiment , the researchers played clips of 11 western and eight pygmy melodies of between 30 and 90 seconds long			2
researchers from @entity28 , the @entity29 and @entity30 in @entity32 , came to their conclusion after travelling deep into the rainforest to play music to @entity35 ( shown ) - an isolated group of people without access to radio , tv or electricity a team of @entity63 and @entity32 researchers played clips of 11 western and eight pygmy melodies of between 30 and 90 seconds long to two different cultural groups - one living in the @entity10 rainforest , and another in @entity31			1
the western music - which included orchestral movements and excerpts from the films , @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 - was designed to induce a range of emotions , including calm , excited , happy , anxious and sad			2
the pygmy pieces were all upbeat polyphonic vocal pieces that are intended to be performed in ceremonial contexts			0
a total of 40 pygmies in the @entity10 who sing regularly for ceremonial purposes and 40 @entity32 musicians in @entity31 were asked to display emoticons with smiling or frowning faces to show whether the music made them feel good or bad			1
researchers also asked the participants to rate whether the music made them feel calm or excited			1
while the two different groups had different opinions about the clips that made them feel good or bad , they agreed that the same tracks made them feel either excited or calm			1

as they listened to the music , measurements were taken to record the participants ’ rates of respiration , heart rates and the amount of sweat on their palms			0
‘ our major discovery is that listeners from very different groups both responded to how exciting or calming they felt the music to be in similar ways , ’ said dr @entity122 , of @entity28 in @entity123			2
‘ this is probably due to certain low - level aspects of music such as tempo , pitch and timbre , but this will need further research			2
’ he noted that the @entity32 musicians described feeling a wider range of emotions as they listened to the western music , compared with the pygmy singers , who did not feel as many when listening to either type of music			1
dr @entity122 suggests this could be because of the varying roles that music plays in each culture			0
researchers also asked the participants to rate whether music - including a clip from @entity71 ( stock image shown ) made them feel calm or excited			1
as they listened to the music , measurements were taken to record the participants ’ rates of reparation , heart rates , and the amount of sweat on their palms professor @entity165 , of the @entity29 ’s @entity166 , said : ‘ negative emotions are felt to disturb the harmony of the forest in pygmy culture and are therefore dangerous			2
‘ if a baby is crying , the @entity35 will sing a happy song			0
‘ if the men are scared of going hunting , they will sing a happy song - in general music is used in this culture to evacuate all negative emotions , so it is not really surprising that the @entity179 feel that all the music they hear makes them feel good			1
’ @entity183 , of @entity30 ’s @entity184 , added : ‘ people have been trying to figure out for quite a while whether the way that we react to music is based on the culture that we come from or on some universal features of the music itself			0
‘ now we know that it is actually a bit of both			0
’ the brains of improvising jazz musicians - such as @entity199 - ' light up ' in areas usually associated with words , a study revealed in june the brains of improvising jazz musicians ‘ light up ’ in areas usually associated with words , researchers revealed in june			0
jazz players engrossed in spontaneous musical improvisations showed activity in areas of the brain traditionally associated with spoken language and syntax - used for deciphering phrases and sentences			0
however , this musical conversation shut down brain areas linked to semantics , which process the meaning of spoken language , according to researchers at @entity220 in @entity221			0
the scientists used @entity224 scanners to track the brain activity of jazz musicians in the act of ' trading fours ’ - a process in which musicians participate in spontaneous back and forth instrumental exchanges , which usually last for four bars at a time			0
dr @entity234 , an associate professor in the @entity235 at the university ’s @entity236 said : ‘ we ’ve shown in this study that there is a fundamental difference between how meaning is processed by the brain for music and language			0
' specifically , it ’s syntactic and not semantic processing that is key to this type of musical communication			0
meanwhile , conventional notions of semantics may not apply to musical processing by the brain			0

researchers from @entity28 , and universities in @entity31 , played music clips to pygmies in the @entity10 rainforest
they found that certain aspects of @entity41 and pygmy tunes make people from different cultures feel similarly calm or excited
but the groups of isolated pygmies and @entity32 had different opinions on the musical clips *thatmade* them feel good or bad
