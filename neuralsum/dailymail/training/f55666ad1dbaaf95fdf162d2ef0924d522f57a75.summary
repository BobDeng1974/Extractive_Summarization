it is the role no father would wish upon his daughter			0
but for @entity3 , who today walked free from court following a trial for sexual assault , having his daughter @entity7 play the part of his rock and constant supporter for every day of the ordeal no doubt gave him enormous comfort			1
@entity7 , @entity3 â€™s 32 - year - old daughter from his marriage to his second wife @entity16 , hardly left her father 's side during the trial at @entity20			1
she was a daily presence , walking shoulder to shoulder with her 81 - year - old father , a comforting hand frequently laid on his back			1
a source told the @entity57 during the case : ' @entity7 has really been there for her dad			2
she adores him and has been a tower of strength			2
as far as he is concerned she is his rock			0
' thanks to her support , he is focused and determined to prove his innocence			0
' @entity3 counted on support not just from @entity7 , but from his actor sons @entity42 , 49 , from his marriage to @entity69 , and @entity44 , 27 , from @entity3 's marriage to his second wife , @entity16 , who died suddenly in 2009 at the age of 58			1
standing by : on day 12 of the trial @entity7 offers her father much - needed support loyal : @entity7 never strayed from her father 's side in the days of the trial , and even accompanied him on the few outings into town he had over the past month support : @entity3 flanked by son @entity42 and daughter @entity7 on day 11 of his trial for historical sexual offences close knit : not just @entity7 but the whole of the @entity3 clan were fiercely supportive of their father back in 2010 , when @entity3 's sons @entity42 and @entity44 made guest appearances on @entity41 , the soap in which @entity3 has starred for more than 50 years , he commented that he would like his daughter @entity7 to join them			1
' my daughter @entity7 is an interior designer			1
but we are hoping she will come into the @entity100 as an extra , ' he said in an interview at the time			0
but while @entity3 's sons have a public profile , @entity7 's life is rather more private			1
she studied @entity107 at @entity108 in @entity109 where she was a friend of prince @entity110 before becoming an interior designer and founder of @entity113 , an upmarket design store listed with an address on @entity117 's @entity116 but registered in @entity7 's name from a different address in @entity52			0
its website is under construction , and little more can be found about the site online			0
@entity7 also worked for a time with society interior designer @entity125			0
quiet life : @entity7 has a @entity128 account but is not a prolific user of the site solidarity : two of the followers of @entity7 's @entity128 account she has an account on @entity128 under the handle @ verityroache , illustrated with a background picture of her family some years ago showing a happy scene of @entity7 as a little girl with her mother and father , and what looks to be her younger brother @entity44			2
but @entity7 is not an active user of the site and , while she follows the usual mix of news site accounts and famous names , had at the time of printing only sent out 34 tweets and had 146 followers			0
two of those followers give a glimpse into the ordeal the @entity160 have been through over the past few weeks : they are accounts set up to help clear the name of the falsely accused			0
student days : @entity7 , who studied @entity107 at @entity108 , with father @entity3 and mother @entity16 , who died in 2009 at the age of 58 @entity7 is clearly as fiercely loyal as she is private			2
she remained by her father 's side today as he left court , saying he was keen to ' get back to work ' as @entity170 on @entity41			0
the actor , who has appeared in the soap since its first episode in 1960 , admitted ' there are no winners ' after he was cleared of rape and indecent assault at @entity20			1
there were cheers and clapping when the jury unanimously cleared him of all six charges , leaving him open to return to the @entity183 soap			2
@entity3 always maintained his innocence and blamed hysteria after the @entity187 scandal for ' money - grabbing ' women who falsely accused him of sex offences			1
early years : @entity7 , right , with mother @entity16 , brother @entity110 ( known as @entity44 ) and her beloved father @entity3 follow @ deboraharthurs on @entity128			1

jurors unanimously cleared @entity3 of rape and indecent assault today
81 - year - old always blamed the ' *spectre* ' of @entity187 scandal for case
daughter @entity7 accompanied him to every court appearance
@entity3 said to have called his daughter his ' rock ' and ' tower of strength '
@entity7 joined at court by brothers @entity42 , 49 , and @entity44 , 27
