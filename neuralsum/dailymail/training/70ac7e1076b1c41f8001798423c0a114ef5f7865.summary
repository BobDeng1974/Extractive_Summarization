by @entity0 , education correspondent a failing school has been turned around just 18 months after a new head took over following the sacking of all its governors by education secretary @entity6			2
@entity7 was forcibly removed from council control and turned into an academy run by an outside sponsor after years of underperformance			1
the school in @entity13 , @entity14 , became a focal point of resistance to mr @entity6 ’s education reforms after union activists bitterly opposed attempts to hand it to an academy operator			1
new broom : principal @entity23 , pictured with some of her pupils , took over the school 18 months ago a @entity27 campaign – fronted by some parents and governors – was backed by the controversial campaign group the @entity30 and the @entity31			1
now @entity32 has reported that the school it became – the @entity35 @entity34 – is ‘ good ’ with ‘ outstanding ’ leadership			1
in their report , inspectors said : ‘ @entity40 ’ progress has improved rapidly since the academy opened in 2012			1
leaders have brought about considerable improvements in teaching , behaviour and achievement because of very high expectations			2
’ it said that since the academy had opened pupils ’ progress has accelerated in all year groups			1
the report noted that pupils ’ results were still well below national averages but were improving			0
battle : union activists fought @entity6 's plans for the school in the courts it marks a dramatic turnaround on @entity63 ’ last full inspection in january 2012 which put the school in special measures – meaning it needed urgent action to turn it round – and heavily criticised leadership and teaching			1
inspectors concluded that ‘ the persons responsible for leading , managing or governing the school are not demonstrating the capacity to secure the necessary improvement ’			0
and they said that ‘ teaching over time has failed to provide sufficient levels of challenge for pupils to make adequate progress in reading , writing and mathematics ’			0
despite the report , campaigners challenged mr @entity6 ’s attempt to turn the school into an academy through the courts			1
the claim was rejected and the school became an academy under the control of the @entity95 academy chain in september 2012 , with its new principal @entity23 taking up her post in december 2012			1
a large number of teachers left but only a handful of parents withdrew their children			1
attempts to block the takeover infuriated mr @entity6 who branded opponents ‘ ideologues who are happy with failure – the enemies of promise ’			0
‘ it ’s the bigoted backward bankrupt ideology of a left - wing establishment that perpetuates division and denies opportunity			0
and it ’s an ideology that ’s been proven wrong time and time again , ’ he declared			0
the latest @entity32 report will be seen as vindication of his insistence the school be taken over			1
the @entity95 chain was founded by the carpets tycoon @entity95			0
its chief executive is sir @entity125 who said he was delighted by the academy ’s progress			2
he added : ‘ what the critics need to remember is that if a school is failing it means the children are failing and are not secondary - ready , and that can not be allowed to continue			0
’ turnaround : the school in north @entity14 , pictured before it was taken over , had been in special measures the school previously came out of special measures in 2005 but just a few years later was told it required ‘ significant improvement ’			1
after it was once again placed in special measures in 2012 , mr @entity6 ordered the sacking of the governors , to be replaced by an interim board selected by the @entity145 ( @entity145 )			0
although the power to remove a governing body had existed for some time , it was never used by the previous @entity150 government			0
the @entity145 said the power was not used lightly			0
miss @entity23 said her key changes were to improve teaching and communication with parents , including having @entity157 and @entity158 interpreters at parents ’ evenings			2
she added that the school now has a 20 - name waiting list for reception places			0
a @entity145 spokesman said : ‘ under local authority control this school had been failing hundreds of pupils for year after year			2
‘ such a swift and impressive turnaround proves that partnering with a high - quality academy sponsor is the best way to improve failing schools			2
’ what are academies ? what are free schools ? what do academies and free schools have in common ?			0

@entity7 removed from control of @entity13 , north @entity14
it became a focal point of resistance with unions and some parents in *uproar*
now @entity32 says the new academy is good with outstanding leadership
