it has taken just seven weeks for @entity1 to go from the hottest property in @entity4 football to being frozen out of the @entity6 team			1
in between opening his account against @entity10 in a 3 - 0 @entity11 win on september 24 and scoring a controversial penalty in a 4 - 0 win against the same opponents at @entity15 on november 30 , it rained goals for the 22 - year - old			2
his 11 in 10 appearances , including a stunning @entity11 hat - trick against @entity20 , had the @entity6 fans beseeching their board to shell out the £ 3million required to land the @entity24 permanently from @entity25			1
@entity1 has suffered a dip in form in recent weeks after an excellent start to his @entity6 career that clamour has faded to bemused silence in recent weeks as @entity1 has gone from scoring hero to simply scoring zero			1
on the pitch , his miserable run of form included six appearances without a goal before @entity37 left him on the bench during wins at @entity40 and at home to @entity42 in midweek			2
the only @entity44 highlights for @entity1 fans to watch in recent weeks have involved a video of the forward giving an impromptu rapping performance , with team - mate @entity49 on human beatbox			1
in @entity1 ’s absence from the team @entity53 , who looked on his way out of @entity55 , has taken on the mantle of golden @entity57 at @entity55 , drawing plaudits from @entity37 this week for his ‘ fantastic ’ attitude and ‘ world class ’ left foot			2
with the @entity6 manager preferring @entity63 as an impact substitute , @entity1 appears to have been pushed down to third - choice forward , with @entity65 being deployed out wide left			1
it ’s not thought @entity1 ’s decision to stall talks on a permanent move until april are keeping him out of @entity37 ’s starting xi. in recent weeks the manager has suggested it is just a form dip , saying : ‘ all strikers go through periods like this			1
we have to focus on what is going to get him out of this situation			0
’ with @entity53 now seemingly in pole position to start next sunday ’s @entity81 semi-final at @entity82 , @entity1 may not get the chance to back up his bold promise to grab a hat - trick against @entity86			1
in the middle of his barren run , he vowed to become the first @entity6 player since @entity90 in 1973 to score a hat - trick against the @entity93 side , adding nonchalantly : ‘ @entity94 went four games without a goal a few weeks ago and no one mentioned it — but when @entity1 does the same it ’s the biggest thing in the world			1
i take it as a compliment			0
’ if the rise and fall of @entity1 is a curious case indeed , one property he does not appear to lack is confidence			2
yet , according @entity107 , a former @entity6 striker who shares @entity1 ’s hunger for goals and his off - field sense of fun , it may be that the @entity25 forward is suffering an unexpected bout of self - doubt			1
on a previous loan in @entity115 , @entity1 scored 20 in 23 games for @entity117 , only for food poisoning from eating chicken to leave him with paralysis of the right leg , ending his season			1
prior to joining @entity6 , he had not played for the best part of two years and @entity107 suspects the player may be harbouring an injury and that ghosts of setbacks past may be preying upon him			2
the @entity6 forward looks dejected after missing a chance against @entity130 last month ‘ maybe @entity1 ’s just biding his time before bursting back into the limelight to score that hat - trick he promised against @entity86 , ’ chuckles @entity107			1
‘ i love the boy ’s confidence			0
you need confidence as a striker			0
i love his banter and i ’d love to see @entity1 — or anyone — score a hat - trick against @entity86 ! ‘ but it looks to me he may have a wee knock that we do n’t know about			1
take it from me , you just do n’t go from being a super-confident striker scoring 11 in 10 games to not scoring at all			1
‘ he was flying but almost overnight it ’s all changed			0
that ’s why i think he maybe has a knock			0
unless you ’re 100 per cent fit as a striker you ’re maybe going to lack that little extra half - yard of sharpness to get in front of a defender and score goals			1
‘ @entity1 ’s been out long - term before with illness and injury and even though he ’s a confident boy , once you ’ve had your first big injury you start to worry			2
it preys on your mind the next time			0
it ’s only human nature			0
‘ i ’m hoping it is just something minor like that and nothing else because i like the boy and he is a very decent player			0
’ @entity1 ’s last goal was a controversial penalty at @entity15 , awarded by @entity173 despite there being no contact on the @entity24 by the sliding @entity10 defender @entity176			2
afterwards , @entity178 pundit @entity177 — a former @entity86 and @entity10 winger — claimed the loanee had ‘ thrown himself down ’ and ‘ conned the referee ’			2
but @entity107 does not believe the ‘ diving ’ fallout led to @entity1 ’s form crashing			2
nor does he view @entity53 as the @entity24 ’s main rival for the leading striking berth			0
@entity1 may not get the chance to score his promised hat - trick against @entity86 next weekend ‘ @entity1 never claimed for the penalty , there was no action taken against him and it all died down quickly , ’ he said			1
‘ and he does n’t seem the type to let that sort of thing affect him anyway			0
‘ the change in @entity53 ’ fortunes has been interesting			0
he was seemingly on his way out of the club but now he ’s getting picked			0
‘ i watched him against @entity42 the other night and he ’s a typical striker , he gets his head down and there ’s no chance of him passing			0
people were screaming at him to pass against @entity42			0
he reminds me of @entity205 in that regard			0
he would never pass it either ! ‘ but i ’ve actually got a sneaking feeling that @entity63 is going to be @entity6 ’s first - choice striker			2
he ’s a decent player , he makes good runs and i think he will come good eventually			0
’ @entity211 , another maverick former @entity6 forward , admits he is equally puzzled as to why @entity1 ’s goals have dried up			1
but he is clear that the player he rates as @entity6 ’s finest striker should not be given a crack from the start against @entity86			1
@entity1 in better times as he enjoyed a run of form that saw him score 11 in 10 earlier this season ‘ it ’s a real mystery and there ’s a lot of people scratching their heads on this one , ” said @entity211			1
‘ @entity1 was scoring a lot of goals but now the other guys are all ahead of him in the pecking order			2
if it ’s not an injury it must be some kind of internal issue because nobody can understand it			0
‘ i think @entity1 is the best striker at @entity6 , and maybe also the best striker in @entity235			1
it ’s not just his goals , but he brings workrate to the team and his attitude seems great as well			0
‘ everyone is looking at the situation and saying : “ @entity243 is this guy not getting a game ? ”			0
‘ i ’ve always thought that if @entity37 played @entity1 alongside @entity53 up front with @entity246 in behind then @entity6 would score goals for fun			1
‘ but @entity6 without @entity1 won 4 - 0 against @entity42 in midweek and they ’ve got maximum points in their last three games			1
you do n’t change a winning team			0
if it ai n’t broke , do n’t fix it			0
so i would n’t start @entity1 against @entity86 , even if he is promising to grab a hat - trick			1
‘ everything comes out in the wash and i ’m sure we will get to the bottom of this situation sometime			0
but , right now , @entity1 ’s situation is a big mystery ... ’			2

@entity1 has gone from hero to zero at @entity6 as his form has dipped
he started with 11 goals in 10 games , but is now on a barren run
@entity1 may not get chance to score promised hat - trick against @entity86
