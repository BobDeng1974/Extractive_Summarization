by @entity0 four friends are living the adrenaline - rush dream - getting paid to go base jumping and skydiving			1
daredevils @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 are the @entity10			1
the group have travelled the world over the last five years , showcasing their talents in disciplines as diverse as paragliding , speed flying , wingsuit cloud surfing , base jumping , and skydiving			2
' when you ’re dangling from bottom of a helicopter , it ’s a pretty amazing feeling , you feel like you should n’t be there			0
usually the helicopter pilot does n’t want you to do it but we assure them that it ’s fine , ' @entity6 said			1
' it ’s actually really scary to climb down on to the skid , so we really like to take people for their first time and watch their face as they do it			0
if it was a jungle gym it would be really easy to do , but when you ’re thousands of metres in the air , it ’s a little unnerving ! ' the full - time thrill - seekers formed the @entity60 in 2008 after approaching portable action camera maker @entity10 for sponsorship in the hope of turning their extreme sports holidays into a paying job			1
' we were all really good friends and jumped together anyway and travelled together , ' @entity6 said			1
' one day we were in @entity67 , staying in a little chalet cabin			0
we were paying for the trips on our own and two of us started talking and saying " would n’t it be cool if we could somehow do this for a living ? " ' we thought it would be a good idea to approach @entity10 and ask them if they wanted to sponsor us – that we would jump at their events			0
they said yes and each year we have worked with @entity10 our relationship has grown and grown			0
' sponsorship : @entity10 member @entity6 flies upside down in a light aircraft			1
the four friends formed the @entity60 in 2008 after approaching action camera maker @entity10 in the hope of turning their extreme sports holidays into a full - time career jumps : @entity10 member @entity6 floats above the mountaintops in @entity89 , @entity90 @entity91 : @entity92 don wingsuits to float down above the @entity31 before pulling their parachutes flying : a member of the @entity10 jumps from a clifftop in @entity97 while wearing a wingsuit but the father - of - two , who lives in @entity100 , @entity101 , with wife @entity102 , was happy to give up property deals to pursue a life of high - altitude high - jinx			1
while the @entity60 are all high - performance athletes at the peak of their game , @entity6 acknowledges that there is a real element of danger involved when the margin for error is so tiny			1
' to fly a wingsuit along the ground for 30 seconds to a minute in the @entity31 , that ’s really scary , but that the stuff i really like , ' he said			0
' there ’s ways to control it for sure , but it ’s definitely like you ’re on the edge where any mistake you make you do n’t do n’t just crash , unfortunately you die			0
' the other guys are all single , but i have a family , so i ’m very aware of the safety aspect of it			0
this stuff ’s really amazing and all , but i definitely do n’t want to die doing it ! ' @entity6 's first experience with a parachute was a base jump off a 500ft tall bridge close to his home , with his wife standing by to film the event and offer moral support			2
' i climbed over the rails and my wife was saying " are you sure you know what you ’re doing ? " but it all worked out fine , ' @entity6 sad			2
' i ’m not sure if she was more scared or i was			0
' growing up with legendary rock climber @entity148 as a father , it 's perhaps unsurprising that @entity6 feels comfortable with risk , although the parachute fanatic admits he also practices yoga every day as a calming contrast to his death - defying leaps			1
and although the @entity60 boys have made thousands of jumps between them , you sense this is one job it 's not ever going to be hard to get out of bed in the morning for			2
' i ’ve had over 10,000 flights in my life , and at least 1,600 jumps , ' @entity6 added			2
' it ’s very , very exciting still			0
' every time i go do a demo jump , i have to pinch myself just to remind me that this is really what i do for a job			0
every time i walk up to the helicopter i get this feeling of " okay , here we go , this is going to be awesome ! " ' ' ca n't believe it ' : mr @entity6 says he has to pinch himself to remind him this is what he gets paid to do			1

@entity6 , @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 travel the world
the full - time thrill - seekers formed the @entity60 in 2008
mr @entity6 , *34* , left a career in property development to pursue his dream
