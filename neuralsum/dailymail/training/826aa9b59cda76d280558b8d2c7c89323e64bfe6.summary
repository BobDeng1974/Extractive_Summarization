i should n’t try to stretch at 29			2
‘ i had done a good warm - up and i ca n’t blame the temperature , it was 35 degrees			0
it was just one of those freak accidents that happen , you overstretch and it just snaps			0
‘ i have to be honest , it was the sorest pain i ’ve ever had but in the few days afterwards i felt good , i thought i was going to be back			1
i just kept pushing myself as far as possible			0
‘ i thought it was maybe just a wee tweak of the hamstring or something , it was a couple of days later i was walking and feeling fine			2
it was only when you get the mri scan , until then you do n’t really know what ’s going to happen			0

in the event , he returned earlier than anyone anticipated			0
@entity56 was in good spirits in training in training last week @entity2 ( centre ) gets his back cracked in training by team - mate @entity62 @entity2 collects the ball during a passing drill in training at @entity65 asked if he can last the full game in @entity4 , @entity2 shrugged : ‘ i ’ll take it as it goes			1
i feel good just now and that ’s three days after the game			2
‘ i trained today so everything ’s feeling good and i ’ll just try to push myself as far as possible and test the boundaries - but my hamstring is feeling as good as it ’s ever felt so long may that continue			2
‘ it was a relief to come through the first training session , let alone the first game			2
especially when it was coming to 35 , 50 minutes on the clock and i had a look up and i was breathing hard			2
‘ you think : “ ten minutes still to go here , @entity2 , try to get a touch of the ball and try to kid on you ’re still looking forward to passing			1
” but it was hard			0

’ manager @entity95 still has his injuries to contend with			0

that ’s what we have to try to do			0
‘ @entity4 will be a hard game , they have a good squad			1

i think we are good enough to play in the @entity140 , we ’ve shown that over the last two or three years when we ’ve done really well in it , beat @entity144 and stuff like that			0
