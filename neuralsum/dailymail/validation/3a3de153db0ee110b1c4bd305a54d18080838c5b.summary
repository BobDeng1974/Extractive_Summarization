@entity1 's impact on friday night was extraordinary			1
what a delight it was to see a young @entity4 , who is leading the @entity6 scoring charts , come on and score for @entity7 within 79 seconds			1
like everyone at @entity10 , i left the ground with a smile on my face because of @entity1 ’s cameo appearance			1
but we do have to measure our praise a little bit			2
on friday against @entity19 he was facing a @entity20 back four			1
to judge @entity1 properly you need to see him over 10 international games — and probably 10 back - to - back games			1
he needs those games to settle in and see what international football is about			2
@entity1 ( left ) scored 79 seconds into his @entity7 debut against @entity19 on friday kane wheels away to celebrate scoring for @entity7 against @entity19 at @entity10 on friday @entity1 's incredible rise continued on friday when he marked his first @entity7 game with a goal what i will say is that from what i ’ve seen of him over the past 12 months , stepping up from under - 21 level to the @entity37 first team , to the @entity38 and now to full international level , he has looked comfortable at every stage			1
he can hold the ball up , he leaps well to head the ball , he works hard and can play in either of the front two positions and his finishing does n’t really need any additional comment			2
he can be a genuine international player but we have to see him against tougher defences first			2
if he starts against @entity49 on tuesday , it will be more of a test both on the pitch and mentally			2
on friday , when he came on , there was nothing to lose			1
the game was won and their back four , which was struggling anyway , had been stretched			2
that ’s a lovely position to be in as a fresh , young striker			2
when you start the focus is all on you and the team is looking to you for the breakthrough goals			2
that ’s a different test			2
and he ’s likely to be up against @entity65 and @entity66 , two of the toughest defenders around			2
i do believe that he will learn quickly and he can raise the bar at international level			2
@entity71 and @entity72 will both enjoy playing with him			1
i ’ve said before that we have n’t had this range of attacking talent since i was the @entity7 manager and had to pick between @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82			1
there are some great options for @entity85 now			2
we ’re not going to mess around any more with @entity71 playing out wide			1
but i can see @entity71 and @entity1 playing up top together , with one dropping in behind at times			1
both of them can do that , so you can rotate the role			0
i had the same kind of pleasant problem going into the @entity97			0
we knew @entity76 and @entity77 could play together and they had a wonderful balance to them , with @entity77 dropping in and @entity76 always playing close to the goal			0
but then @entity78 burst on the scene with his lightning pace			0
i did n’t want @entity76 to play in the pocket if he played alongside @entity78 , because that ’s not his best position			0
so we had to work at the system so that both of them would have little spells where they would be up top : @entity78 because of his pace and @entity76 because of his goal threat			1
if you look at @entity78 ’s famous goal against @entity116 , he comes from deep			0
that ’s because he had dropped in for that period of the game and that was something we had specifically worked on			0
i did n’t want a 4 - 4 - 2 with two strikers playing square because , at international level , that ’s food and drink to defenders			1
@entity1 headed in @entity7 's fourth against @entity19 shortly after replacing @entity71 it has been queried how @entity1 ( left ) would fit in a starting line - up alongside captain @entity71 @entity1 and @entity71 in the same starting line - up could see formation turn to a 4 - 3 - 3 the attacking full backs , @entity130 and @entity131 , would be able to provide width to the attack i think @entity71 and @entity1 can do that , so that when we ’re in possession it naturally changes into a 4 - 3 - 3 , with the wide men pushing high			1
and if they stay up square of each other , the two wide men can come back down and the full - backs can get overlaps on them			1
that should happen so you ’re changing your shape constantly			0
it also gives your wide player the opportunity to come inside and , although he ca n’t play on tuesday , @entity148 did that fantastically on friday , driving into the box			1
he is going to win so many penalties doing that because he ’s flying at people and throws defenders off their guard			0
and with @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 to add to the mix , it really does feel like a great period for @entity4 forwards			0
give @entity1 a bit of time and there ’s no reason to think he ca n’t be an important part of that			1
it is not just @entity1 who we have to be careful not to overpraise			1
we need to be realistic about this @entity7 team , too			1
the qualifying campaign is telling us very little about whether @entity176 ’s team have progressed since the @entity97			0
we ’re in control of the games and dominating possession			0
but we need to know how to play when we do n’t have the ball and whether we can keep possession under pressure			0
we ’re not really going to know if they ’re good enough until june 2016			0
friendlies wo n’t give us a real idea , as teams like @entity49 will be chopping and changing			0
@entity176 is refusing to get carried away with the hype that is surrounding @entity1 @entity148 ( left ) produced a man - of - the - match display in @entity7 's win against @entity19 @entity159 ( left ) scored his first @entity7 goal in the victory over @entity19 on friday as the @entity97 demonstrated , if you ’re a little bit short , two years of work can all be over in 180 minutes of football			1
there ’s nothing like a tournament to apply some cold reality			0
i think @entity200 is a really good defender but he and @entity201 struggled against @entity49 and @entity202 at the @entity97			0
we do n’t know whether that weakness is still there			0
and we do n’t have the depth of defenders , because @entity208 , @entity209 and @entity210 have n’t seized their chance yet			0
our wide forward players like @entity148 and @entity159 look great but they do n’t have to defend that much			0
the problem will come when they get dragged back against much better sides			0
and let ’s see how well the full - backs stand up when they are put under pressure			1
it was down that left side with @entity148 and @entity130 that @entity49 caught us out in the @entity97			0
@entity208 ( left ) started alongside @entity200 in defence for @entity7 against @entity19 @entity148 ( second right ) celebrates @entity7 's second goal with @entity200 and @entity159 if @entity7 have less of the possession against @entity49 on tuesday it would be probably be beneficial in the long term			1
we wo n’t have been used to playing without the ball			0
major international tournaments are like being an @entity229 athlete who has to be ready for a few days of competition every four years			0
let ’s hope @entity7 are up to the @entity229 standard because we ’re only going to find out next june .			1

@entity1 scored on his @entity7 debut against @entity19 on friday
@entity1 looked comfortable on the biggest stage at @entity10
he could line - up with @entity71 in a system near to a 4 - 3 - 3 formation
