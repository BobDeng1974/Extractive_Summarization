the @entity1 wo n't move to impeach president @entity2 , and the idea is ' all a scam started by @entity5 at the @entity6 , ' house speaker @entity0 said tuesday			1
' this whole talk about impeachment is coming from the president 's own staff , and coming from @entity5 on @entity11 , ' @entity0 told reporters			1
' why ? because they ’re trying to rally their people to give money and to show up in this year 's elections			0
' on monday the @entity17 emailed its largest donor list with a request for money based specifically on impeachment fears			1
@entity22 : @entity0 said @entity5 have cooked up baseless impeachment fears in order to raise money smoking gun : the @entity17 begged donors for money on monday by floating the idea that @entity30 could impeach the president the president , vice president and first lady , the solicitation read , ' need your help , because it ’s a critical moment			1
@entity6 @entity30 will vote this week to sue the president			2
and the @entity6 believes it could lead to @entity2 ’s impeachment			2
' ' it ’s time to have the president ’s back			0
with the most critical deadline we ’ve faced in just days , we ’re still 75,000 donations short of our goal			0
' adding fuel to @entity0 's contention , a top @entity6 aide used the ' i ' word on friday during a @entity54 breakfast event , tying the threat of impeachment to a lawsuit @entity0 is pursuing against the @entity2 administration			1
the legal action , @entity59 said , has ' opened the door ' to a presidential impeachment			0
' impeachment is a very serious thing that has been bandied about by the recent @entity30 vice presidential nominee and others in a very un-serious way , ' said @entity59 , hat - tipping former @entity68 governor @entity67			0
' we take it very seriously and i do n't think it would be a good thing			0
' @entity67 said of @entity2 just days ago in @entity72 that ' if he 's not impeachable , then no one is			0
' @entity0 has said plainly that his lawsuit , which focuses on the @entity6 's unilateral changes to the @entity77 law , will not be a prelude to removing @entity2 from power			1
' this is not about impeachment , ' the @entity6 speaker said on july 9			2
' this is about faithfully executing the laws of our country			0
' he added a more definitive statement on tuesday , saying that the @entity6 leadership has ' no plans to impeach the president			1
we have no future plans			0
' staying : @entity2 does n't face an impeachment threat , @entity0 said , preferring to take the president to federal court over his administration 's changes to the @entity77 impeachment refers to a formal process prescribed in the @entity100 for throwing a president or a federal judge out of office			1
the @entity6 would first bring charges against @entity2 and vote to approve them			0
the @entity106 would then hold a trial on those charges and vote on whether to convict			2
the @entity100 reserves impeachment as a remedy for ' high crimes and misdemeanors , ' which the framers understood to be official crimes committed while in power			1
@entity0 and other @entity6 leaders have tried to tamp down conservative @entity30 ' expectations in recent weeks			1
a senior @entity6 staffer told @entity118 that tuesday 's words would be welcome in establishment circles since @entity5 ' control of the @entity106 makes removing @entity2 from office a guaranteed non-starter			1

a @entity133 / @entity132 poll released on friday found that one - third of @entity135 , 33 per cent , believe @entity2 should be impeached and removed from office			0
fully 65 per cent disagreed .			0

@entity6 or *representatives* wo n't move to impeach , @entity0 told reporters
he said talk of impeachment is an election - year **fundraising** ploy launched by the @entity6 itself to help @entity5 in *november*
the @entity17 send a **fundraising** email on monday asking for money to fend off impeachment threats
*tea* *party* *republicans* have hoped for the gutsy move from @entity11
@entity5 control the @entity106 , which would have to convict the president of ' high crimes ' or ' misdemeanors ' to remove him from office
