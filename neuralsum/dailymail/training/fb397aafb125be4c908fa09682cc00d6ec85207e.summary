@entity0 crooked over a computer ... leaning onto your elbow to answer the phone ... slouched on the sofa when you get home ... picking up children in both arms ... it 's no wonder the modern back is a crooked mess of tight muscle knots and painful nodules			1
and many of us are spending a fortune every year begging pricey physiotherapists , chiropractors , osteopaths , @entity22 teachers and massage therapists to snap us straight again			1
but a new gadget - named the @entity25 and not much more complicated than a crooked stick - is promising to change our lives forever ... and save us a tidy pile of pounds in the process			1
you can do this all on your own			2
this method of releasing knots is often known as acupressure or @entity51 massage , the ancient @entity53 technique used by sports masseurs and physiotherapists all over the world by improving blood flow and reducing tension			1
to use the nodger you hold the foam handle with two hands , one above the other			2
then hook it over your back with the red nodule on the peskiest knot			2
office manager @entity67 said : ' i have my @entity25 with me all day at work in my handbag			1
i have never had so many visitors at my desk wanting to try it out			0
it sounds dodgy , but it works a treat ' relax your shoulders and push the nodger away from you to apply targeted pressure into the knot , allowing the pressure to continue for one deep breath in and out			0
@entity31 ca n't get enough of the crooked contraption , and the ' @entity33 ' read pretty impressively , too			0
mother - of - three @entity82 says : ' @entity84			1
this is the best product i 've bought in years			0
my husband is happy too as he says i do n't ask to be massaged as much now			0
