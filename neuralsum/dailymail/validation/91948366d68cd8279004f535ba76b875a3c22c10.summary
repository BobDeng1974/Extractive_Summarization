snuggled up together and almost holding hands in their sleep , this is the heart - warming moment twin baby girls were reunited after spending their first six weeks apart as they battled for life			1
@entity6 and @entity7 , who were born six weeks premature and with holes in their hearts , were immediately placed in separate incubators			1
weighing just 4lb 13oz each , they were wired up to a tangle of bleeping monitors , tubes and drips			0
after weeks of complications and treatments in hospital , the twins were finally well enough to go home and have their first cuddle in a @entity23 basket , dressed in matching pink sleep suits			2
@entity25 , 31 , gave birth to twin girls @entity6 and @entity7 ( pictured ) after going into labour at the 34 - week stage of her pregnancy and both girls were born with holes in their hearts - known as congenital heart defects parents @entity36 ( pictured left with the twin girls ) and @entity37 ( right ) , from @entity38 , @entity39 , have been in and out of @entity40 after both girls fell unwell after the birth and needed urgent care their mother @entity36 , 31 , said yesterday : ' they 're both little fighters			1
they really are both little miracles			0
' the twins were born just one minute apart in an emergency caesarean on november 25 , after mrs @entity25 's waters broke 34 weeks into pregnancy when she choked on a crisp			1
@entity49 , who was born second , was immediately whisked away for checks and medication as she had large holes in her heart			2
mrs @entity25 , who was wheeled in her hospital bed to visit the pair in intensive care nine hours after their birth , said : ' just seeing them so small and so helpless , it was very hard			1
i could n't hold them			0
mrs @entity25 gave birth after her waters broke when she choked on a crisp			2
the girls weighed just 4lbs and 13oz when they were born ( pictured ) and while @entity6 was allowed home straight away , @entity7 was kept in hospital as well as being born with large holes in her heart , baby @entity7 ( pictured in hospital ) also had a condition which meant she had a narrowing of the aorta and had no septum between the two ventricles of the heart ' sitting around watching them in a box was the hardest thing			1
' but this was only the start of an emotional roller coaster for mrs @entity25 , a college secretary , and her husband @entity86 , 47 , who runs an event management business			2
when @entity7 was eight days old , she had to have a six - hour operation to repair narrowing of her aorta , the large blood vessel in the heart , and to have her pulmonary artery ' banded ' to reduce blood flow to her lungs			1
the operation was a success but days later @entity6 , who had been allowed to go home because her heart condition was not life - threatening , turned blue and was rushed back to @entity40 where her sister was recovering			1
while baby @entity6 ( pictured ) was originally allowed home after birth , she was taken into intensive care just weeks later after being struck down with a severe case of bronchiolitis - a lower respiratory tract infection both @entity7 ( left ) and @entity6 ( right ) spent six weeks apart while both were cared for on different wards at @entity40			1
they have since been allowed home and are now three - months - old the girls are pictured enjoying their first cuddle together at just five - days - old			2
they were later separated for six weeks while @entity7 received heart surgery and @entity6 was cared for in intensive care for a chest infection diagnosed with bronchiolitis , a respiratory infection , @entity6 spent 12 days sedated and ventilated and had to be given a blood transfusion			1
@entity7 was finally well enough to go home on @entity117 and @entity6 on january 2			1
they joined their sisters , @entity120 , six , and @entity121 , nine , at the family home in @entity38 , @entity39			1
now nearly four months old , the twins are both making a good recovery , although @entity7 faces further heart surgery this year , when surgeons will patch up the holes in her heart			1
mrs @entity25 said : ' i feel like i have been running on this rollercoaster of adrenaline ever since the birth ... i 've been constantly on red alert , worried my children might die			2
i feel very lucky that both my girls are okay at the moment			0
' she added : ' everyone at the hospital was amazing			0
' the care we 've had has been second to none ... i 'm glad they 're both better and doing well , we could n't be prouder			0
' congenital heart defects are problems with the heart 's structure that are present at birth			0
these defects change the normal flow of blood through the heart			0
the heart has two sides , separated by an inner wall called the septum			0
with each heartbeat , the right side of the heart receives oxygen - poor blood from the body and pumps it to the lungs			0
the left side of the heart receives oxygen - rich blood from the lungs and pumps it to the body			0
the septum prevents mixing of blood between the two sides of the heart			0
however , some babies are born with holes in the upper or lower septum			2
a hole in the septum between the heart 's two upper chambers is called an atrial septal defect ( @entity178 )			1
a hole in the septum between the heart 's two lower chambers is called a ventricular septal defect ( @entity183 )			1
asds and @entity185 allow blood to pass from the left side of the heart to the right side			0
thus , oxygen - rich blood mixes with oxygen - poor blood			0
as a result , some oxygen - rich blood is pumped to the lungs instead of the body			0
children who have simple congenital heart defects can survive to adulthood			0
they can live normal , active lives because their heart defects close on their own or have been repaired			0
- @entity198 the twins , who are now three - months - old , have been recuperating at home with their older sisters , six - year - old @entity120 and nine - year - old @entity121			2
pictured ( from left ) @entity120 , mother @entity36 , @entity121 , @entity6 and @entity7 while the twins are now at home recuperating , @entity7 ( right ) will be taken back into hospital shortly to undergo further heart surgery			1
doctors will continue to mend her heart using tissue from elsewhere in the organ @entity6 ( left , top ) and @entity7 are now being cared for at home by their parents and sisters @entity120 ( right top ) and @entity121 ( right bottom )			1
