it utilizes the vertical take off and landing of a helicopter and couples it with the off road driving capabilities of a truck			1
and , what 's even better , is that this robotic warrior is remote controlled			2
introducing @entity11 , a specially made truck that comes complete with eight rotors - four on each side - that will spring out for take off and then fold in while driving			1
the machine was built as part of a @entity18 military desire for a ' multi-mission medical and casualty evacuation unmanned air vehicle / unmanned ground vehicle ' , according to @entity21			1
scroll down to video the @entity18 military commissioned the creation of a vehicle that can drive and fly remotely so it can be sent on missions unmanned @entity27 features eight rotors that expand when necessary and fold away while on the ground @entity29 tested the transformer 's flight earlier this year essentially it meets the need of an autombile that can adapt to a variety of situations			1
an @entity18 government study on medical evacuation concluded that the use of robots in military missions will allow for casualty evacuations in areas and times that manned platforms should not operate in , such as ' zero - zero ' weather and contaminated environments			1
once the @entity48 reaches its target , its also possible for the controls to be switched and for it to be driven by a human			0
overall , it reduces the risks involved with many missions			0
@entity27 is also designed for cargo delivery			1
as per its design , the @entity11 is able to shrink down its helicopter engines so that it is more drivable test : a prototype takes flight during initial testings tests were carried out in february to see whether the @entity27 could be used by the @entity18 military in the future this artist 's impression by the developer @entity29 showed what they intended the @entity70 to look like @entity29 , an @entity71 - based firm , plans to test a remotely operated , transforming , flying , driving evacuation vehicle early this year ' the @entity74 is interested in using the @entity48 vehicle for unmanned cargo resupply missions , ' @entity29 chief engineer @entity73 tells @entity21			1
' they 've done work on this in the past with other platforms , such as the @entity82 - @entity83 , but our platform will be much less expensive			2
' the driving components were tested in late 2013 , while the flying aspects will be tested before the end of february			1
the @entity27 would allow the military to enter and exit dangerous areas without having to send in soldiers in november , it was reported that @entity18 soldiers in combat had made a request for drones that could be launched by hand			1
it prompted the @entity97 to commission three - dozen micro-drones that resemble birds			2
@entity100 of @entity101 announced at the time the @entity103 @entity102 , or @entity102 , awarded them $ 4.5 million in federal contracts to deliver to the @entity105 36 models of the company ’s @entity108 unmanned aerial vehicle by december			2
each @entity108 can soar through the sky at speeds up to 55 knots and has the ability to offer soldiers an array of advantageous features			0
each aircraft weighs roughly two - and - a - half pounds , and according to the @entity118 , the @entity108 ’s flexible wings help enable the @entity120 to blend into its surroundings			2
in november , the @entity105 ordered 36 drones known as ' @entity123 ' that could be hand launched and were fitted with cameras for reconnaissance missions almost there : the truck - mounted laser weapons the army hope will prove to be a game - changer on the battlefield then in december , the @entity103 successfully tested a futuristic laser weapon capable of shooting football - sized mortar rounds			1
the truck - mounted weapon , known as the @entity136 ( @entity137 ) , gives a hint at what a weapon of the future could look like			0
using an invisible laser beam to exact targets , the rounds are capable of taking down drones from the sky and even missiles			0
in november , the @entity105 ordered 36 drones known as ' @entity123 ' that could be hand launched and were fitted with cameras for reconnaissance missions during tests , a ' quarter - sized ' invisible laser beam successfully targeted and destroyed more than 90 incoming mortar rounds and six to seven unmanned drones			0
@entity154 , the project manager for the laser program , told @entity156 the test results were ' above and beyond ' what they had expected going into the testing			0
' we had no thoughts that this 10 - kilowatt would be as successful n doing that as it has been , ' he said			0
mortars are common battlefield weapons that are hard to protect against because they can be fired from short distances			0
the mortars used in the test were standard 60 millimeter rounds – the length of a football — fired from a distance of less than two kilometers in salvos of two to three mortar rounds each			0
the laser ’s success rate against incoming mortar shells indicates that battlefield protection from the small explosive rounds could be possible in a few years .			0

new drone is in development to meet the requirements of the @entity18 military for a new evacuation vehicle
currently being tested by @entity29 , an @entity71 - based firm
called @entity27 , it would be capable of both flying and driving and would be operated by a remote
