by @entity0 published : 21:01 est , 1 december 2012 updated : 05:46 est , 2 december 2012 a retired couple say they must knock down and rebuild their £ 800,000 home , after 500 litres of toxic kerosene was accidentally pumped into it - but their insurers refuse to pay the cost			1
the delivery of the highly toxic kerosene had been intended for their neighbours but a new tanker driver picked the wrong pipe and sent it gushing into the side of their house			1
now , 11 months after the accident , @entity18 and @entity19 have filed a @entity22 claim for the cost of rebuilding the five - bedroom property to eliminate the toxic vapours that still contaminate it			1
dispute : @entity18 and @entity19 say their home must be demolished and rebuilt after an oil company accidentally pumped 500 litres of kerosene into the property retired businessman mr @entity33 , 66 , said : ‘ we ca n’t move back in because it remains contaminated			1
you can still smell the kerosene in every corner of the house			2
‘ we simply ca n’t accept that through no fault of our own we should have our home seriously devalued and left stinking of dangerous chemicals			1
‘ our only recourse has been to pay our own costs and go to law to argue that to decontaminate it entirely it would need to be demolished and a new property built			2
’ the couple were preparing breakfast in their designer kitchen on december 29 last year when disaster struck			2
' i was n't even dressed , ' recalled mrs @entity19 , 65			1
' we were recovering from having 21 family and friends for @entity60 and it was one of those lazy mornings between @entity63 and @entity64			2
' we saw the oil tanker pull up outside to deliver next door and @entity18 said he was going to have a word with the driver because on recent deliveries they had spilt oil into the hedgerow outside causing it to die back			1
' something distracted us and a couple of minutes later this young man was running up our drive shouting , “ where 's your tank ? ”			2
‘ the answer was that we do n’t have an oil tank as this property has been on @entity83 for 20 years			1
when @entity18 went outside to see what was happening , he found himself paddling in oil			1
it was the start of a nightmare which is still going on			2
' home area : the couple 's house is in the hamlet of @entity90 in @entity91 , near @entity92 the company , @entity93 , have admitted liability for the error which was caused by a new employee attaching the tanker full of kerosene to the wrong pipe at the front of the properties in the hamlet of @entity90 , @entity91			1
inexplicably , he had not seen the pipe on the right which served the @entity33 's neighbours and instead blasted in excess of 500 litres of oil through the redundant pipe which led to the side of their bungalow			1
within seconds the oil dispersed into the clay - built foundations of the £ 800,000 detached bungalow which stands in five acres of land			1
worse still , the vapours from the oil permeated every corner of the home and its contents			1
' we just woke up one morning and lost our happy home of 14 years ' @entity19 within hours , @entity93 had sent out a ' spill team ' followed by an environmental rep from their insurers with a meter to test for dangerous fumes			1
' wherever he went in the house be it the conversion upstairs or downstairs , his meter was glowing red , ' said mrs @entity19			1
' he just said , " this is extremely serious			0
you ca n't stay here			0
you must go to a hotel "			0
the fumes were just overwhelming			0
' all the @entity63 decorations were up , the fridge was full of food and drink for @entity64 but we ended up fleeing to a hotel			0
’ the next day , the spill team fitted an extractor fan to a hole punched through the foundations and told the couple to close the doors and windows to allow it to work effectively			0
they left at 4pm on friday , telling them they would be back after the long @entity64 weekend			0
admission : the company , @entity93 ( whose head office in @entity159 is pictured ) , have admitted liability for the error which was caused by a new employee attaching the tanker full of kerosene to the wrong pipe ' i remember trying to cook us a meal , ' said mrs @entity19 , ' but the fumes were too much			1
i felt nauseous and had a headache			0
my husband , who has had a bad heart , was sick and started getting palpitations			0
' despite making endless calls , no - one got back to us until the following tuesday so we were left to cope with this appalling situation on our own			2
we ended up retrieving what we could and going to our daughter ’s house			0
’ when their own insurers , @entity182 , sent a loss adjustor to assess the damage , the @entity181 were told that it could be ‘ remediated ’			0
' our experts have said that kerosene contains some volatile components and if you can smell them there is a risk to health ' @entity33 large trenches have been dug at other end of the property in an attempt to flush out the oil and the @entity33 ’s have been told that there is no more that the insurance companies are willing to do			2
so , 11 months on , the home that had been the hub of their family life , looks like a crime scene with warning tape stretched around it , large holes leading into the foundations and its interior covered in polythene sheeting			2
the heady smell of chemicals remains			0
the @entity33 's @entity22 papers claim damages ‘ in excess of £ 300,000 from the oil company and their home insurers , @entity217 including £ 60,258.05 for the contents of their home which were ruined in the accident along with losses for personal injury , and costs			1
‘ our experts have said that kerosene contains some volatile components and if you can smell them there is a risk to health , ’ said mr @entity33			0
building changes : when their own insurers , @entity182 , sent a loss adjustor to assess the damage , the @entity181 were told that it could be ' remediated ' ( file picture ) ‘ to decontaminate the house entirely it would need to be demolished and a new property built			0
their remediation has not gone far enough			0
' at least they should have excavated the entire downstairs , removed the contaminated soil and installed a vapour membrane in the damp proof course			0
’ the trauma has triggered bouts of insomnia in mrs @entity19 , a mother of four and grandmother of nine			1
' we are confident that @entity33 and mrs @entity252 ’s home can be restored to its original state with no requirement for demolition , based on the advice we have received from oil spill remediation experts ' @entity217 spokesman ‘ we just woke up one morning and lost our happy home of 14 years , ’ she added			1
' it is our major asset , our retirement fund and was our pride and joy			0
‘ you would hope that insurance companies would be there for you			0
all we seek is a fair and just response to this dreadful incident from those responsible			0
’ a spokesman for @entity217 said : ‘ we are confident that @entity33 and mrs @entity252 ’s home can be restored to its original state with no requirement for demolition , based on the advice we have received from oil spill remediation experts			1
‘ we appreciate this is a stressful time for our customers and are committed to supporting them through the period of their claim			2
’ a spokesman for @entity159 based @entity93 said : ' all parties are working to ensure an appropriate resolution for those involved			0
as the case is now a legal matter it would be inappropriate for us to comment further			0

@entity18 and @entity19 claim they must knock down and rebuild home
their five - bed bungalow in @entity90 , @entity91 , was damaged
an oil company worker accidentally sent toxic *liquid* down the wrong pipe
