most people feel pretty risqué having one or two tattoos , but one man has taken body art to an entirely new level			1
@entity5 , 24 from @entity6 has covered his face , neck and torso with dozens of tattooed words			1
far from the elaborate artistic designs most tattoo fans covet , @entity11 has basic words , inked in different sizes , spread haphazardly across his face and body			2
as well as his own name in huge letters on his stomach , @entity11 ’s arms and face are covered with words such as ‘ sex bomb ’ , ‘ iconic ’ , ‘ @entity44 ’ , ‘ fame ’ and ‘ guilty ’			1
@entity11 has also had hairs tattooed onto his chest			2
speaking to @entity48 , @entity11 explains : ‘ drawings do n’t mean anything to me			0
it may sound like i have bad values or something , but my tattoos are n’t just for me			0
@entity11 also had chest hairs tattooed onto his torso , but we assume the facial hair is real @entity11 says his ambition is to be the ' most famous man in the world ' @entity11 got his first tattoo - the @entity64 logo on his chest - aged just 16 ' i want to be an image for people to look at , something that has an impact			1
everybody who sees me is bound to ask questions : “ why fame ? what ’s his life like ? ” ’ @entity11 caught the body art bug early , getting his first tattoo - the @entity64 logo - at aged 16			0
he now has 24 words tattooed on his face			1
despite the fact the words will be with him forever , he is surprisingly relaxed about choosing them			2
far from the elaborate artistic designs most tattoo fans covet , @entity11 has chosen to mark himself with words , inked in different sizes and haphazardly scrawled across his face ‘ it ’s very superficial			2
i ’ll go on @entity88 and listen to all the big hits and i ’ll just take words from these songs			0
for example , “ @entity95 ” is from the song by @entity93 , but it ’s also what i want			0
‘ a lot of people ask me if i ’m scared i might regret it one day			0
if i was indecisive , i do n’t think i would write on my face			0
’ unsurprisingly his highly unusual appearance combined with his good looks are gaining him increasing attention online , which is a good thing for the man who says he wants to be ‘ the most famous man in the world			1

at just 24 , @entity5 has 24 tattoos on his face alone
began at age 16 , choosing words as drawings ' do n't mean anything '
has phrases like ' iconic face ' scrawled on his face
also has fake chest hair tattooed on his torso
