a cosmic constant known as the ‘ golden ratio ’ is said to be found in the shape of hurricanes , elephant tusks and even in galaxies			1
now researchers say this ratio is also seen in the topology of space - time , affecting the entire universe as a whole			1
and they say this number can be used to link everything in the universe together , from space - time to chemistry to biology			1
@entity19 researchers have claimed that the universe is governed by a ' golden ratio '			1
they say space - time itself is defined by this mathematical constant			1
the ratio - 1.618 - is found across nature in plants , hurricanes and more ( shown )			1
but the researchers say it is also ever - present in the universe the research was carried out by dr @entity33 at the @entity34 and dr @entity35 of the @entity36 in @entity19			1
they say the golden ratio - 1.618 - can be seen ‘ related not only to aspects of mathematics but also to physics , chemistry , biology and the topology of space - time			1
’ and it may dictate how certain things in the universe take shape			0
fans of @entity51 's @entity50 will remember when the protagonist professor @entity52 explains how mathematics and art collide via the ' golden ratio			2
' for those who have n't read the populist thriller , it is the number 1.618 which has been plucked from the famous @entity60 sequence			0
in this sequence each number is the sum of the previous two , so it beings 0 , 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34			0
if you take two successive numbers their ratio is very close to 1.618			0
this is n't that impressive on its own			0
until you realise that this ratio is the key to everything from encrypting computer data , to the numbers of spirals on a sunflower head , our own limbs and why the @entity79 is so pleasing to the eye			0
some have argued that because the sequence seems to grow in an ' organic ' way , the golden ratio may play a part in nature			2
the ratio of 1.618 has already been found externally all over the human body			2
it usually marks the proportion of your hand to your forearm as well as the distance between your three knuckles on each finger			0
the spiral numbers in a sunflower will always total a @entity60 number , while dividing those pointing right and left will give you two consecutive fibonacci numbers linked by the ratio 1.68			0
these spiral patterns are also found in pineapples , cauliflowers and pine cones			0
the golden ratio , represented by the @entity109 letter ' phi ' , is said to be is a mathematical connection between two aspects of an object			2
it can be artificially used – for example , some 20th century artists used it for the rectangular shape of their portraits from the long side to the short side			0
they believed that the ratio created an aesthetically pleasing appearance			0
but the ratio is not just artificially created – it is apparently found through nature in the stems of plants , skeletons of animals and so on			2
and the shape of spirals also seem to follow the golden ratio			2
this suggests that geometric shapes in the universe ultimately succumb to this mathematical property			0
‘ a convincing case for assuming a cosmic character of the golden ratio can be made based on the ubiquity of logarithmic spirals , ’ the researchers write			2
‘ spectacular examples include the @entity141 ( @entity141 ) , ammonites , the shape of @entity145 shells , @entity146 and the distribution of planets , moons , asteroids and rings in the solar system			0
’ the researchers suggest that the reason that this ratio is so ubiquitous is that it is actually a property of space - time			1
‘ the argument that this amazing consilience ( self - similarity ) arises from a common environmental constraint , which can only be an intrinsic feature of curved space - time , is compelling , ’ they write			1
‘ the time has come to recognise that relativity and quantum theories can be integrated , and linked numerically to the value of a mathematical constant - whether in the context of space - time or biology ’ quite why the universe follows this rule , however , is not known			1
some think that our fine - tuned universe is simply a lucky coincidence and , under the multiverse theory , there are an infinite number of other universes that were not quite so lucky			1
the researchers say the golden ratio might make up space - time itself			1
some have suggested our universe may have been the only one in the multiverse theory to have this ratio that allowed it to form			1

@entity19 researchers say the universe is governed by a ' golden ratio '
they say space - time itself is defined by this mathematical constant
the ratio - 1.618 - is found across nature in plants , hurricanes and more
but the researchers say it is also ever - present in the universe
this means it might make up space - time itself
some have suggested our universe may have been the only one in the multiverse theory to have this ratio that allowed it to form
