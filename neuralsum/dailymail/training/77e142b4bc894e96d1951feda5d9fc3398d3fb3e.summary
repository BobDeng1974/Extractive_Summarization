@entity0 are hoping to take @entity2 winger @entity1 on loan until the end of the season			1
much depends on their budget though with @entity0 struggling to finance deals following the arrival of @entity10 from @entity11			1
the 22 - year - old @entity1 has made just the 13 @entity13 appearances since arriving at @entity14 from @entity15 a year ago and has also attracted interest from @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19			1
@entity1 is wanted in a loan deal by @entity0 after failing to make his mark at @entity2 meanwhile , @entity2 youngster @entity22 is joining @entity23 on loan after being recalled from a spell at @entity26			1
@entity27 wanted to keep the 21 - year - old right back , who joined them in november , but @entity2 are keen for him to play in the championship			2
@entity2 youngster @entity22 , in action for @entity26 , will join @entity23 on loan @entity33 remain determined to keep hold of @entity35 this window despite @entity38 's desire to sign the @entity40 defender			1
rumours are rife that @entity38 have made an offer but @entity33 are struggling to rectify a poor season and selling their captain now would only aggravate disgruntled fans further			1
the club also opened talks with @entity48 about a new contract although he and his advisers have apparently asked that a buy - out clause remains intact , something the club is reluctant to agree			0
@entity38 target @entity35 is likely to stay at @entity33 in this transfer window @entity57 's return to form means @entity59 are unlikely to consider letting him go this month			1
several @entity13 sides including @entity18 , @entity62 , @entity0 and @entity63 hold an interest in the @entity66 international who had lost his way a little following injury last season			1
however , @entity70 has been happy with the 23 - year - old 's performances of late and believes he has a role to play			2
@entity57 , racing past @entity76 's @entity75 , has come back into form and will likely stay at @entity59 @entity57 said : ' unless the club come and tell me they want me to leave then i wo n’t be going anywhere			1
i ’m fighting for my shirt			0
the last six or seven windows have been the same , with my name linked with other clubs			0
' team - mate @entity85 remains a target for @entity18 though			0
new manager @entity87 wants a left back , two wingers and a midfielder to bolster his squad			0
@entity11 midfielder @entity92 is wanted on loan by @entity95 side @entity94			1
the 19 - year - old has made four appearances since his summer move from @entity99 and came on as a substitute for @entity101 in tuesday night 's @entity102 draw with @entity63 at @entity103			2
he had a loan spell with @entity105 earlier in the season and they are interested too			1
@entity94 , however , are fifth in the @entity95 , seven points off leaders @entity110 , and believe a couple of shrewd acquisitions this month could give them the extra edge required to challenge for promotion			1
@entity92 , son of @entity17 boss @entity115 , is wanted by @entity94 on loan to aid their promotion push @entity11 are open to the loan as they want @entity92 to keep developing and he needs competitive games for that to happen			1
@entity94 , meanwhile , are giving a trial to @entity122			2
the @entity124 centre back played just over an hour in a back three for @entity125 against @entity126 this week			0
they scored five first - half goals in a 6 - 1 victory in the @entity130			0
the 24 - year - old @entity122 has previously played for @entity131 and was on loan at @entity133 and @entity134			2
@entity136 's ambitious bid to sign @entity137 could meet an abrupt end as the @entity140 international is poised to tell @entity141 he wishes to join @entity19			1
@entity141 had hoped @entity142 would come to the table but that has not materialised and @entity19 have offered a £ 2m loan fee with £ 10m to follow over the next three years			2
@entity141 winger @entity137 is likely to turn down the advances of @entity136 in favour of a move to @entity19 @entity136 expect winger @entity149 and new signing @entity150 to both be in training on wednesday when the first - team squad reports back from a two - day break			1
@entity149 has been out since november with a thigh injury			0
@entity156 have no plans to sell @entity158 this month			2
there have been enquiries from agents looking to broker deals for @entity163 and @entity164 but it is understood that no formal approaches have been made			0
talks are ongoing over a new contract for the 25 - year - old who is valued at around £ 20m			0
@entity156 want to hang on to star man @entity158 in the face of interest from @entity163 and @entity164 @entity172 are looking to buy @entity174 's teenage striker @entity173			0
the 17 - year - old has impressed scouts enough for the club to offer £ 200,000			0
@entity178 and @entity17 have also watched him closely over the past season and @entity174 will find it hard to turn down offers but will look capitalise on one of @entity184 's brightest young talents			2
@entity185 have shown an interest also			0
@entity187 are battling it out with @entity189 for @entity191 striker @entity190			0
manager @entity192 has just two fit strikers and @entity190 , 22 , is among the names on his radar			0
the @entity196 under 21 international is in the final year of his deal at @entity191 and is looking to move on this month .			0

@entity0 want @entity1 on loan until the end of the season
@entity33 want to hold on to @entity35 this transfer window
@entity57 likely to be staying at @entity59 this month
