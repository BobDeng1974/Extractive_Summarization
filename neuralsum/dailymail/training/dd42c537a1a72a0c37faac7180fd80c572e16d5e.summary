recently indicted congressman @entity0 , best known for threatening to throw a reporter ' off a f * * * * * g balcony ' , attended a sweet 16 party last weekend and set off a frenzy amongst the teen girls present as he posed for pictures			1
the @entity8 representative from @entity9 made the special visit to a constituents birthday and his arrival caused the girls to swoon over the @entity14 and one to declare him her ' bae ' - slang for ' before anyone else			1
' the unexpected teenage freak out over the infamous @entity21 tough - guy sparked some fevered @entity23 posts , with the same girl exclaiming , ' f * * * * * g ' @entity0 is going ' and that she was ' gon na dance with him all night and make him fall in love with me			1
' scroll down for @entity27 before anyone @entity28 : this is one of the tweets discovered by @entity32 of congressman @entity0 's attendance at a sweet 16 birthday party over the weekend			1
@entity0 is a friend of the girl 's family and was attending for them			1
her identity has been obscured in this , one of the tweets she sent somewhat inappropriately for the combative 44 - year - old , @entity32 is reporting that @entity0 told the teen that this would not be their last encounter			1
' he told me he 's taking me to prom i was like you fricking better , ' the teen added to @entity23			0
indeed , @entity32 reported that another teenage girl at the party began tweeting exited conversations she heard about @entity0 between her and her friends			1
' ' oh sh * * now i have to wear nice underwear , ' she wrote			0
the tweets have since been removed from the @entity58 and it is not known where the party was held			0
awkward : @entity0 's heartthrob status on @entity21 may be known to insiders , but it seems that teenage girls feel the same way about he controversial politician party hopes : the girl took to social media to tell her followers that she will be doing her best to make the ex-marine turned @entity8 politician fall in love with her when reached for comment , a spokesperson for @entity0 explained the congressman is a ' personal friend ' of the birthday girl 's family and did not just gatecrash the party			1
the congressman , who was briefly married in 2004 , but is now single , has been labeled one of the sexiest bachelors in @entity82 in the past			0
his all - action - hero past , in which he served in the @entity85 and for a time as a special agent with the @entity87 , has marked him out as an eligible bachelor on @entity21			0
however , it seems that @entity0 is never far from controversy			1
in september , 2013 , @entity0 was subject of allegations from the @entity92 that he had acted inappropriately in public for a member of @entity82			1
the magazine claimed that witnesses had seen him going inside a restroom with a woman for 15 minutes while at bar in the @entity101 area of @entity102			0
the congressman , who represents @entity104 and parts of @entity102 , apparently spent such a ' long f * * * * * g time ' in the bar 's bathroom that ' people were talking about it '			2
@entity0 's colorful past crops up again in a 2011 @entity114 article written by @entity115 about undercover @entity87 operations in the city			1
allegedly in july , 1999 , @entity0 was apparently conducting an affair with a married woman while he was working with the @entity87			2
watch video here : bully pulpit : rep @entity0 , a @entity8 from @entity104 , was being interviewed by @entity123 about the @entity125 address when he became angry with the reporter and threatened him fit of rage : the 43 - year - old retired @entity14 and former @entity87 agent went after @entity130 , threatening to throw him off the balcony threat of violence : @entity0 ( right ) was caught on camera telling @entity135 : ' i 'll break you in half			1
' apparently , one night in 1999 , @entity0 and the lady he was dating entered the @entity142 nightclub in @entity143 and bumped into her estranged husband			2
@entity145 , was an off - duty @entity146 officer working as a bouncer at the club at the time and he broke up what turned into an altercation between the two men			0
however , he told the @entity114 that around 2.30am , @entity0 returned for a standoff in the parking lot and was waving a gun around screaming he was going to kill the husband and saying , ' i 'm a f * * * * * g @entity87 agent , ai n't nobody going to threaten me			2
' however , @entity0 is most famous for allegations of fraud and for threatening the life of a reporter who asked him questions he did not like			2
in april , @entity0 was charged with 20 criminal counts addressing different fraud allegations after turning himself in to @entity87 headquarters in @entity169			2
the @entity8 representative from @entity104 entered a not guilty plea to a @entity173 magistrate in connection to all 20 counts which include several fraud charges relating to a health food store that he ran before running for @entity82			2
he is charged with mail fraud , wire fraud and tax fraud , all of which are connected to his involvement in an @entity185 restaurant where he was an investor before launching into his political career in 2010			0
facing charges : congressman @entity0 turned himself in to the @entity87 in april ( pictured ) after it became clear that they will be filing charges against him in connection to a restaurant he was involved in before being elected to @entity82 the bulk of the alleged crimes themselves took place before he was a congressman , and he is accused of concealing more than $ 1million in receipts , as well as hundreds of thousands of dollars that were kept away from employees			1
@entity0 , 44 , is familiar with the @entity87 headquarters as he worked for the agency for more than a decade before leaving in 2006			2
' as a former @entity87 agent , representative @entity0 should understand the motto : fidelity , bravery and integrity , ' @entity87 assistant director @entity202 said in a statement			0
' yet he broke our credo at nearly every turn			0
in this 20 - count indictment , representative @entity0 lived by a new motto : fraud , perjury and obstruction			1
' and in january , @entity0 stormed off during a live television broadcast when @entity123 reporter @entity135 tried to ask him about a controversy over his campaign finances - but @entity0 returned to confront the tv news man			1
investigation : @entity222 ( right ) who was previously in a romantic relationship with @entity0 ( left ) was charged in april with lying to the @entity87 and making up false donors to illegally funnel his campaign money conducting their interview around the balcony of the @entity21 , @entity0 squared up to @entity135 and told him ' you ever do that to me again i 'll throw you off this f * * * ing balcony ' before threatening to break @entity135 in half ' like a boy '			0
the incident was caught on camera , showing how @entity0 cut the interview short after refusing to answer questions about the probe			0
although the audio in the clip that captured the exchange is very low , a transcript provided by @entity123 shows that at one point @entity0 said to @entity130 : ' let me be clear to you , you ever do that to me again i 'll throw you off this f * * * ing balcony			0
’ the reporter attempted to defend himself , pointing out that he simply wanted to ask ‘ a valid question			0
’ in response , @entity0 told him : ' no , no , you 're not man enough , you 're not man enough			0
i 'll break you in half			0
’ in the wake of the incident , @entity0 released an unapologetic statement claiming that he was ‘ extremely annoyed ’ because he was doing @entity123 a favor by agreeing to do their interview first			0
‘ the reporter knew that i was in a hurry and was only there to comment on the @entity125 , but insisted on taking a disrespectful and cheap shot at the end of the interview , because i did not have time to speak off - topic , ’ @entity0 said .			1
