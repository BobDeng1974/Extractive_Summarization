@entity0 was last night at the centre of a new racism storm over shocking remarks made by @entity5 officials about @entity6 and the murdered black teenager @entity7			1
one mocked mr @entity7 as ‘ @entity9 ’ and said his grieving mother was ‘ boring us all to tears ’			1
another , writing just days after @entity6 ’s death , said that some ‘ base - born ’ people were ‘ intended by nature ’ to be ‘ slaves ’			1
sickening : @entity5 members made comments about @entity6 ( left ) and @entity20 , mother of the murdered @entity21 , in posts on an internal party forum opponents said that the remarks – made on an internal party forum used by senior figures , including party leader mr @entity0 – revealed the ‘ true face ’ of the party			1
some of the most shocking messages concerned mr @entity7 , who was killed in a racist attack in @entity32 in 1993			1
@entity33 , secretary of @entity5 ’s @entity35 branch , wrote : ‘ the image of @entity7 has been promoted to sainthood , with his own memorial site , constant invocation of his name in any discussion of racism ; even to close down a discussion about immigration when the issue bore no relevance to his murder ’			1
@entity48 : @entity49 , the secretary of @entity5 's @entity35 branch , referred to the murder victim as ' @entity9 ' ms @entity33 then accused @entity51 of ‘ worshipping at the shrine of @entity9 ’ , complaining that ‘ we are supposed to publicly mark the anniversaries of his death			1
please give it a rest ! ’ ms @entity33 added in the message , left last year : ‘ i ’m sure his mother still grieves for him , but it ’s time she did it privately without setting him up as some kind of media icon			1
boring us all to tears			2
’ another contributor to the forum , @entity69 , a @entity5 council election candidate , commented as part of the same exchange : ‘ as for @entity72 , i feel sorry for the parents of many white youths that have been murdered			2
no one seems to give a toss			0
your son gets murdered , you become an expert on race relations it seems			0
but only if you are a particular colour ’			0
the death of former @entity84 president @entity6 last month prompted some @entity5 members to discuss whether it was ‘ time for a reappraisal ’ of the reviled apartheid system			0
@entity88 , a member of @entity5 ’s @entity90 branch , used the site to argue that some people were ‘ intended by nature ’ to be slaves and were ‘ marked out for subjection ’ from birth			1
he went on to quote selectively from @entity98 literature to argue that a ‘ base - born man ’ can ‘ never conceal his real nature ’			2
he concluded with the offensive line : ‘ that kingdom in which such b * * * * * * * , sullying [ the purity of ] the castes , are born , perishes quickly together with its inhabitants			0
’ the word b * * * * * * * has been removed from the quote , on the grounds that it was ‘ offensive language ’ which had been ‘ auto - deleted ’			0
other postings appear to confirm the claims of @entity5 ’s opponents that many of its activists back the policies of openly racist far - right groups such as the @entity119 ( @entity119 ) and the @entity120 ( @entity120 )			1
one councillor , who uses the online name @entity123 , boasted : ‘ some individuals who voted for @entity119 in desperation , because there was no other alternate where we did n’t stand , have come over to us now			2
’ outrage : veteran anti-apartheid campaigner @entity129 said the comments showed ' the true face of @entity5 ' @entity132 , a @entity5 committee member in @entity133 , wrote : ‘ i actually agree with the @entity120 on what they protest about			1
’ and @entity136 , a @entity5 member from @entity137 , said : ‘ what really grinds my gears about it is people are declaring the @entity120 as “ extremist ” which is tosh in my eyes			1
’ and in a message earlier this month , @entity147 , who is a campaign manager for @entity5 ’s @entity148 , declared @entity5 should be directly targeting @entity119 voters in the wake of their leader , @entity151 , being declared bankrupt			0
new force : mr @entity0 vowed to start a campaign for the 2015 general election to ¿ pick off ¿ vulnerable seats , including several held by @entity156 noting that the @entity119 received hundreds of thousands of votes in the 2010 general election , mr @entity147 said : ‘ we should be picking up 50 - 75 per cent of those now			2
’ last night , veteran anti-apartheid campaigner @entity129 said : ‘ this is the true face of @entity5			0
under their thin veil of respectability lurks rampant bigotry and prejudice , fed by disenchantment and feelings of social injustice			0
‘ none of these comments surprise me , because whenever i speak out about apartheid i am bombarded with bigoted and quasi-racist tweets from @entity5 supporters			0
’ last month this newspaper revealed that @entity175 , an ally of mr @entity0 , had been captured on video saying of immigrants : ‘ i just want to send the lot back			2
’ mr @entity0 vowed yesterday to start a new targeted campaign for the 2015 general election to ‘ pick off ’ vulnerable seats , including several held by @entity156			2
he declared : ‘ this party feels itself to be a new force in @entity184 politics			0
the goal is to get enough representation in @entity187 to make the difference			0
’ last night , commenting on the forum posts , a @entity5 spokesman said : ‘ @entity5 does not endorse any of the comments made on this forum which go against the party ’s principles and core values			1
‘ however , the party does not police open discussions			0
where elected representatives or party figures make comments bringing the party into disrepute , we act accordingly			0
