the legendary film director predicts that consumers will soon be asked to pay different prices *depending* on the type of movie they go to see
with prices for summer blockbusters and event movies rising *sharply*
he said it is inevitable that a series of *multi-million* blockbusters will flop and radically change how the industry works
he also revealed that ' @entity12 ' came ' this close ' to being a @entity75 premier rather than a cinema release
