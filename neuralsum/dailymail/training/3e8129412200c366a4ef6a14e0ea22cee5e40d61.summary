by @entity0 nowhere else in your life are you forced to spend time with such a variety of people as you are when at work			1
yet a psychologist claims that each colleague can be put into one of five personality types , including the @entity11 , who would ‘ sell their own mothers to get ahead ’ and the @entity12 who is the office gossip			1
each type was compiled using psychological profiling based on various research carried out by @entity20 , but which one are you ? @entity22 , psychologist at @entity23 - based @entity20 , has created a guide that reveals what the five types of office workers , including @entity27 who shout at colleagues and will ' stop at nothing to become successful ' @entity22 , occupational psychologist and business analysts at the @entity23 - based firm has created a guide that reveals the signs to look out for , how to stay in the good books of the different types , and highlighted some key psychological traits			1
the first type is @entity27 , according to @entity22 they ‘ are the ones who will stop at nothing to become successful ; they ’ll sell their own mothers if it means they ’ll get ahead			1
’ the best way to work well with @entity46 is to show them respect , but not to reveal any weakness , and above all @entity22 claims it ’s important to make yourself ‘ invaluable ’ to them			1
psychologically speaking , these types are low on the agreeableness scale and very high on emotional stability			1
they ’re low on empathy and mildly extraverted			1
the @entity11 how you can recognise them : ' these guys are the ones who will stop at nothing to become successful ; they ’ll sell their own mothers if it means they ’ll get ahead , ' said @entity22			1
how to work with them : ' the softly , softly approach would seem like a good antidote to these guys , but do n’t be fooled			1
' try not to show too much weakness , be thorough and resolute and ready to hold your corner			1
plan your approach to work , keep up your pace of work and make yourself invaluable through your own insight			1
what not to do : show them up in big meetings , win at their expense - they might catch you out later			1
personality make up : these guys are low on the agreeableness scale and very high on emotional stability			1
they ’re low on empathy and mildly extraverted , meaning that they ’re out for solo success and not really a team player			1
the @entity12 how you can recognise them : ' @entity94 or girl , they ’re the ones you can always rely on for a pick - me - up chat and a cup of tea			1
' they ’ve been in the business for years and are probably in a support or admin role			1
they never socialise with you but subtly know all the gossip in the office			1
' how to work with them : always say hello to them in the morning and offer to make them a cup of tea			1
invite them to the pub after work and insist they come			1
what not to do : ' meddle with their systems or set way of doing things			2
' they ’ve been in the company for years and wo n’t welcome a young whippersnapper changing things			2
' personality make up : they ’re highly extraverted with average emotional stability			1
' this means they ’re warm and approachable and will welcome any interaction			2
@entity22 said this type are low on openness , meaning that they like their set way of doing things			2
the @entity135 how you can recognise them : ' always booking after - work drinks , will be thinking about the @entity139 in july and seem to know everyone around the office , ' explained @entity22			1
' they appear to do minimal work but everyone still loves them			2
' how to work with them : ' take five minutes to say hello in the morning , ask questions and interact with them			2
keep them occupied with people - related tasks as was this wo n’t feel like work to them			2
' what not to do : ignore them or their social events			2
try and avoid them if you ’re busy or have a tight deadline , continued @entity22 , ' otherwise you ’ll be doing that report in the small hours after those drinks you ’ve been forced into			2
' personality make up : they are high on extraversion , low on emotional stability and high on openness			1
socialites are ' the life and soul of the party ' and will want everyone to join in			2
' he added work is probably where their main social circle is			2
' they may be slightly needy and will seek constant social stimulation			2
' the @entity94 with ' @entity178 ' how you can recognise them : @entity181 was a @entity183 tv show in the late 90s and early 2000s in which a young boy could stop time using a magic pocket watch			2
they ’re the ones we ’d all like to be			2
they ’re in the office first and leave last and according to @entity22 this type have ' already been to the gym and done the school run , but still look amazing			1
' they ’re able to be in a thousand different places at once			0
how to work with them : ' they ’re quick , so you ’ll need to be able to keep up ' said @entity22			0
he said to plan work around their movements			0
what not to do : @entity22 advised not to keep this type waiting or run over time			0
' they run an efficient ship and you ’ll need to be just as organised to work with them			0
' personality make up : they are motivated self - starters and full of energy ; nothing is too much for them and they ’ll take anything on			1
they ’re low on detail and will figure things out along the way			0
the creative how you can recognise them : ' think ‘ @entity228 tech geeks ’ and you know who these guys are , ' said @entity22			0
' their hair is messy ; they probably have a beard and wear flared jeans and their desks have seemingly unrelated knick - knacks on them			0
' how to work with them : give them space to think , suggested @entity22			0
' provide them with coffee and constant stimulation to help their creative process			0
' what not to do : people should avoid disrupting the creative process or ' waving the rulebook in their faces			0
' personality make up : they are high on openness and low on conscientiousness			1
they ’re unlikely to conform to conventional rules or working practices and thrive in teams that go against the grain			0
on what seems like the opposite end of the scale are @entity263 types			1
these are colleagues who have been in the business for years , mainly in an admin or support role , and know all of the office gossip			1
people can get on their good side by saying hello and making them tea , but should n’t ever ‘ meddle with their systems ’ or tell them how to do their job			0
they ’re ‘ highly extraverted with average emotional stability ’ but low on openness , meaning they like their set way of doing things			0
socialites are the life and soul of the party and will want everyone to join in , claims @entity22			0
' work is a social event for them and it 's probably where their main social circle is ' the socialite will be the person that organises all the work events including the @entity139			0
@entity22 ’s profiling describes this type as being ‘ high on extraversion , low on emotional stability and high on openness			1
’ adding : ‘ they are the life and soul of the party and will want everyone to join in			0
work is a social event for them and it ’s probably where their main social circle is			0
’ but this can make them needy			0
if you ’ve got a team member who is always early for work , goes for a run or the gym before work and still looks unfazed then they might bethe @entity94 with @entity178 ' type			0
@entity181 was a @entity183 tv show in the late 90s and early 2000s in which a young boy could stop time using a magic pocket watch			0
according to @entity22 : ‘ do n’t keep this type waiting or run over time			0
they run an efficient ship and you ’ll need to be just as organised to work with them			0
they ’re quick , so you ’ll need to be able to keep up			0
’ this does make them motivated , but low on detail and prefer to work things out along the way which can lead to mistakes			0
more laid - back types fall under the creative category			1
creatives are described as ‘ @entity228 tech geeks ’ with messy hair			0
men may also have beards and wear flared jeans			0
colleagues can spot them because they ’re desk is covered in ‘ unrelated knick - knacks ’ and they always ‘ need space to think			0
’ @entity22 claims these people do n’t like sticking to the rules and will find ways to go against the grain			0
this makes them high on openness and low on conscientiousness .			0
