by @entity0 published : 18:59 est , 25 march 2012 updated : 12:54 est , 26 march 2012 drivers may find themselves without fuel - with petrol pumps across the country running dry - after fuel drivers voted in favour of strikes today			1
in a painful reminder of the fuel protests of 2000 , when truckers blocked the crucial flow of fuel to the forecourts , drivers may find themselves stranded following the vote by @entity16 members to strike			1
the 2,000 balloted union members supply fuel to 90 per cent of the nation 's garages via seven haulage companies - and a strike could cause 7,900 stations to close			1
the fallout of the ballot could see the nation brought to a crippling standstill , with drivers unable to find enough fuel for everyday tasks , and businesses or organisations such as the @entity32 struggling to function normally			1
@entity33 ( when fuel cost less than 80p a litre ) : cars rushed to the forecourts as tankers struggled to make it to garages for just over a week in september 2000 the nation came to a virtual standstill as protesters blocked the crucial flow of fuel			1
while truckers and farmers blockaded refineries , petrol stations ran dry , tempers soared and panic buying raged			0
with the memories of the previous strike still fresh , the government has announced that soldiers are being lined up to stand in for the tanker drivers if strikes go ahead			1
however , @entity57 leader @entity56 has yet to condemn the threat of crippling industrial action by @entity16 , which is one of @entity57 's biggest donors			1
workers in seven major distribution companies - @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 - were balloted for industrial action			2
a spokesman for @entity66 , which pays workers an average of £ 45,000 a year , said @entity16 walked out of negotiations			1
a @entity66 spokesman said : ' we are dismayed at the outcome of the @entity16 ballot for industrial action involving 650 drivers on our fuels contracts			1
the results for the seven companies involved in the ballot are : ' particularly as only 215 drivers out of the 650 voted for strike action and we therefore believe that this action is being driven by a small disaffected group of employees			1
' in our history of delivering petroleum products for large oil companies , @entity66 has not had a major accident or serious injury to a member of our team			0
' pay and conditions for @entity66 drivers are among the best in the industry			2
our drivers earn on average £ 45,000 a year			2
' they are well rewarded because they are professionals , highly trained and skilled in the work that they carry out , particularly with regard to health and safety			0
' we have been actively engaged in discussions with @entity16 through the @entity108 to examine ways in which these high health safety and training stands can be applied across the industry but @entity16 walked away from those discussions			1
' however @entity16 's general secretary said the union was simply trying to establish ' minimum standards '			1
@entity117 said : ' these votes send a clear message throughout the industry and should prompt all the major companies to get around the table to establish minimum standards			0
' this is not about pay - this is about ensuring that high safety and training standards are maintained , so that our communities are safe			2
' it is about a simple measure , the creation of an industry - wide bargaining forum			2
it is about bringing fairness and stability back to an essential national industry			0
' the union is led by the militant @entity140 , who has also called for strikes to disrupt the @entity142			0
those comments were labelled ‘ unacceptable and wrong ’ by mr @entity56 - but the @entity57 leader has not commented on his latest vote			1
ghost of 2000 protests : tankers blockaded ports in order to prevent fuel reaching stations in protest at the government tax on fuel unite , the country ’s largest trade union , is also the biggest donor to the @entity57 , handing over around £ 3million a year			1
it gave £ 10,000 to @entity56 ’s leadership election campaign – which only succeeded because of his backing from trade unions			1
tricky position : a ballot by the drivers ' union unite is likely to pile pressure on the @entity57 leader , pictured , to condemn the threat of action the government said it had ' robust resilience and contingency plans ' to deal with a strike and had already started to put these in place to minimise any disruption to the public			1
energy secretary @entity177 said : ' the @entity16 ballot result is disappointing			1
' the government is strongly of the view that strike action is wrong and unnecessary			1
the union should be getting round the negotiating table , not planning to disrupt the lives of millions of people across @entity186			0
' this is an industrial dispute and we strongly urge @entity16 to resolve it by getting back to the negotiating table , not by threatening the nation with economic and social disruption			1
' our economy is just getting back on its feet and any action that makes that harder is totally unjustified			0
' with the @entity196 approaching , it is unacceptable and selfish to behave in this manner and jeopardise our international reputation			0
' @entity16 has committed to ensuring that essential services are not disrupted			2
we trust it will live up to this commitment and not put anyone in harm ’s way			0
' the government stands ready to take whatever action we can to minimise the impact of any strike			2
' if we have to , we will use emergency powers to make sure supplies for emergency services are prioritised and we will work to ensure trained military personnel are available to drive oil tankers			0
' the police will be on hand to ensure that strike action does not intimidate or prevent drivers that wish to work from doing so			2
' while their main concerns are pay and conditions , which are matters for their employers , they have also raised health and safety			0
we take health and safety very seriously and will be looking carefully at what @entity16 is saying			2
' ensuring people are safe at work is a priority for us and we are committed to resolving any issues around this			0
' but we are clear - first and foremost - the parties must get back around the table			0
there is no justification for this			0
it ’s the wrong action at the wrong time			0
' ministers say the training of @entity241 drivers will begin next week			0
@entity242 in @entity57 's side : the union is led by the militant @entity140 , pictured , who has also called for strikes to disrupt the @entity142 cabinet office minister @entity246 said the government had learned from 2000 , when many petrol stations ran out of fuel and the @entity32 was placed on red alert			1
he said : ‘ we are calling on the trade union @entity16 and the employers involved to work together to reach an agreement that will avert industrial action			2
‘ widespread strike action affecting fuel supply at our supermarkets , garages and airports could cause disruption across the country			2
‘ the general public should not and must not suffer from this dispute , and strike action is manifestly not the answer			0
although we are pushing for an agreement , we have learnt the lessons of the past and stand ready to act to minimise disruption to motorists , to industry and , in particular , to our emergency services			0
’ the contingency plans have been drawn up by mr @entity246 , transport secretary @entity274 , home secretary @entity275 , health secretary @entity276 and energy secretary @entity177			0
however , the @entity277 , which represents about 5,500 forecourts , said it did not think the government was prepared for a strike			1
chairman @entity281 said : ‘ we have had no word from the @entity283 whatsoever , so we have not been asking our members to keep their stocks at a high level			0
’ on its online ballot form , @entity16 says : ‘ while the oil industry rakes in multi-billion - pound profits , the drivers who supply fuel to forecourts across the country are being squeezed ... the major employers have been slashing drivers ’ terms and conditions and cutting corners on training and safety in a bid to win contracts			1
’ tanker drivers earn around £ 45,000 a year for 37 hours of work a week .			0
