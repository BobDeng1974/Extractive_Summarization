@entity0 is hoping to recruit an army of volunteers to help survey some of the country 's 345,000 grade ii listed buildings in a bid to stop further damage being inflicted on dozens of structures each year			1
from next year , the organisation hopes that volunteers will cover every building of interest from barns to libraries , private homes and factories , in a bid to compile the first ever comprehensive list detailing the condition of all @entity19 's listed heritage			1
@entity0 announced the drive to recruit people as it launched its 2013 @entity22			1
under threat : @entity24 in @entity25 , south west @entity26 , has been put on the @entity0 at @entity27 and is in need of a £ 2million pound refit			1
historic : the listed house was built by painter @entity32 as a country retreat for him and his father tired : the building has been declared at risk of decay or neglect by the @entity0 and needs an urgent refit the register reveals that 5,700 listed buildings are at risk from decay or neglect			1
that number has fallen by 131 since last year , but @entity0 wants to remove a quarter of the entries from the list by 2015			1
a pilot scheme using 350 volunteers in areas including @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 , saw some 5,000 @entity57 buildings visually surveyed			1
@entity58 , chief executive of @entity0 , said volunteering was a chance to help save a historic building or improve a conservation area			1
he said : ' for @entity0 it means we will eventually get , for the first time , a complete picture of the condition of all @entity19 's listed heritage			1
' we can use this information to decide how best to deploy our national expertise to help owners and all those tackling heritage at risk on the ground			1
' important role : @entity24 was built in 1813 and later served as a ' shadow factory ' producing airmen 's uniforms in need of attention : some restoration on the damaged home has already begun with @entity0 hoping to reduce its at risk register by 25 per cent by 2015 at risk : @entity86 's @entity85 in @entity87 , @entity88 , dating from 1800 , but now derelict , has been added to the @entity0 under threat list this year buildings added to the at risk register this year include @entity24 , in @entity92 , south - west @entity26 , currently undergoing restoration , which was built by the artist @entity32 for his father in 1813 and later served as a ' shadow factory ' producing airmen 's uniforms			1
