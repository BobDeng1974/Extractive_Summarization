his partner , and @entity10 ’s mother , @entity44 - @entity43 , 26 , was earlier acquitted in court of a charge of causing or allowing the death of a child			1
@entity49 , prosecuting , told the jury how the defendants were staying with @entity53 ’s parents during the weekend of @entity10 ’s death			1
@entity1 had been left in charge of @entity10 , while @entity53 went to have her nails painted , when the injuries were suffered at some point after 10am that day			1
mr @entity59 said : ‘ @entity10 was shaken violently , she may also have suffered further head impact			1
‘ her injuries were so severe , having become unconscious and stopped breathing - she was in her father ’s hands at the time - she suffered a heart attack			1
‘ she never recovered and was allowed to die the following day , the doctors unable to save her			0
‘ she had n’t suffered those injuries as a result of choking or vomiting on her bottle as her father said but as a result of violent shaking by the adult holding her , her own father			0
’ he added that @entity22 had inflicted the ‘ terrible ’ injuries ‘ probably in anger ’			2
@entity1 shook his four - month - old daughter @entity10 ( above ) so violently while left alone with her that she had a heart attack and stopped breathing			1
she also suffered skull fractures , rib fractures and bleeding to the brain @entity10 ’s mother , @entity44 - @entity43 , 26 , ( pictured left outside @entity3 ) was earlier acquitted of a charge of causing or allowing the death of a child			1
@entity22 ( right ) was told he will serve a minimum of 17 years mr @entity59 said post mortem examinations showed that @entity10 had suffered a rib fracture between four and eight weeks prior to her death with the same rib and another being fractured again about 14 days prior to her death along with three skull fractures			1
she suffered further rib fractures between three and five days prior to her death and showed signs of previously having suffered bleeding to the eyes			2
mr @entity59 said that there was ‘ ’ stress and strain ’ in the household and @entity53 feared that @entity1 might leave her			2
other causes for the stress were money worries , with @entity22 taking out short - term loans to shore up their bank account			1
@entity1 , who worked as a debt collector , had also been experiencing trouble at work and had been facing disciplinary procedures after his performance had ‘ dipped ’			2
and his drug use also added to the strain on the household , mr @entity59 said			0
he added : ‘ he is a drug user			0
he smoked cannabis on may 5 , the day before events on may 6 and historically , at least , had taken cocaine			0
’ on the morning of may 6 2013 , @entity117 , dialled 999 to report his daughter was not breathing and was ‘ limp ’			0
@entity10 ( above ) was taken to @entity119 on may 6 last year but she was pronounced brain dead and a life support machine was turned off the following day			1
she was four months old on arrival , paramedics carried @entity10 to a bedroom , placed her on the bed and fought to save her life			2
@entity1 claimed at the time that he had tried to feed @entity10 10 minutes before and said he discovered she was not breathing after going to check on her , the five - week trial heard			1
paramedics managed to revive the youngster and took her to @entity130 in @entity131 but her condition deteriorated and she was later transferred to @entity119			2
however , she was pronounced brain dead and a life support machine keeping her alive was turned off the following day			0
had she survived , the extent of her injuries would have also left her blind			2
judge mr justice @entity138 said @entity10 ’s injuries were not caused accidentally as @entity22 claimed			1
he said : ‘ this is a sad and tragic case involving the killing of a little girl less than five months old			0
‘ after a time , she would not bond with you at all and she would start to cry if you even approached her			0
‘ it is clear to me that you became frustrated , you gripped and squeezed her by the chest so hard that you broke her ribs			0
‘ you must have known she was in pain as she would have screamed			0
‘ the skull fractures were caused by her head coming into contact with a hard object and she would have screamed in pain			0
@entity53 ( centre ) attended @entity1 's trial at @entity3 with her parents @entity156 and @entity158 ‘ that morning , you caused what were catastrophic injuries which would in a matter of seconds cause her collapse and you knew what you had done			1
‘ the finger of suspicion also pointed momentarily at ms @entity43 , who was arrested and charged with causing or allowing @entity10 ’s death			1
‘ her victim impact statement outlines the devastating effect that the death of @entity10 has had on her and the rest of her family			1
following @entity10 ’s death , her mother @entity171 and grandfather @entity172 released the following poem paying tribute to her			1
‘ to our darling @entity10 , your right to grow has been taken away ‘ you can not mature , you can no longer play , this so cruelly denied in a barbaric way			2
‘ our memories shared with our nation ’s heart , may your story grow and help those in part			0
‘ you leave a mother , and grandparents , your family who loved you dearly , we will all miss you			0
‘ the police heard your voice , they continued to search , but they knew your killer , like you from the start			0
‘ your body helped in a way you did not know , we thank you for that , we love you so			0
‘ your dad hurt you , he has no regret , he closed your eyes , he stopped your breath			0
‘ he has now been judged , he deserves no rights , you are now free from pain , we now say goodnight			0
’ ‘ they would have loved to see that little girl grow up and become closer to them			0
she was just a vulnerable child			0
’ before being sentenced , @entity1 told the court he had wanted to be more financially secure before having @entity10 , adding : ‘ the day @entity10 died was the day everything fell apart			1
’ in mitigation , @entity210 told the court : ‘ the fatal injuries were not caused with malice but with frustration that he wanted to love her more but she would n’t let him			0
‘ it is a tragic case for all concerned - for @entity44 , for @entity10 ’s grandparents and those who knew her			1
’ today , bank advisor ms @entity43 wept and embraced her family in the public gallery as the judge handed out the life sentence to @entity117			0
the jury previously cleared her of causing or allowing the death of a child after it was deemed she could not possibly have known the extent of @entity10 ’s injuries and took steps to ensure her welfare with several visits to gps			1
following today ’s sentencing , detective chief inspector @entity233 of @entity232 , said : ‘ the trial into the death of baby @entity237 has been a harrowing and difficult experience for all those involved			0
‘ we welcome this verdict and hope that @entity10 ’s extended family have now got answers to at least some of the many questions they had around her untimely death			2
‘ @entity10 ’s death was at the hands of a man whom she most relied and depended upon for love and the most basic care			2
she was abused and horrendously let down by this man - her father			0
‘ without the abhorrent behaviour of her father , @entity10 would still be alive today			2
‘ investigations into this type of case are often extremely complex and difficult for officers , staff and the family of the deceased			0
‘ i would like thank the entire investigation team and the many medical professionals and specialists for all their hard work and dedication in bringing this case to an appropriate conclusion			0
‘ i would also like to personally thank @entity10 ’s extended family for their understanding and patience during what must have been one of the most challenging times of their lives			2
