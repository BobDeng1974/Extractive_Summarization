by @entity0 and @entity1 last updated at 11:31 pm on 6th september 2011 the police chief whose force is investigating the hospital insulin poisonings has likened the probe to the @entity7 mystery ' @entity8 ' – but on a massive scale			1
in the much - loved whodunit , @entity10 had to contend with 12 suspects , any of whom could have carried out a brutal killing on the iconic train			1
but following the dramatic release of the sole suspect , nurse @entity20 , detectives are having to examine a bewildering 700 people who could have contaminated saline fluids at @entity23 in @entity24			1
free : charges against @entity20 , 27 , pictured for the first time yesterday , were dropped on friday @entity27 , chief constable of @entity28 , said the challenge facing officers was not only to prove that one of them was responsible for the poisoning , but also to conclusively eliminate all the others			1
‘ we have a situation where 700 people may have had access to the crime scene and yet we have to show that no one else could be involved , ’ he told the @entity35			1
‘ it is like @entity8 but with a lot more people on the train			1
‘ the situation is almost unique			0
normally in a murder in a house or a pub you can quickly establish who was at the scene			0
this will take many months			0
’ @entity20 , pictured , now plans to sue police for a six - figure sum , claiming wrongful arrest , or trying to gain compensation worth up to £ 1million innocent : miss @entity20 and her fiancé @entity59 yesterday challenge : @entity27 says hundreds must be eliminated from probe mr @entity27 admitted that the fact that the ward at the centre of the investigation had remained open throughout further complicated police inquiries			1
‘ we did discuss shutting one ward with the hospital , but it was decided that moving people out of a ward could pose a risk to their welfare , ’ he said			1
and he confirmed fears that the number of agency staff – some from abroad – passing through the hospital over the period at the centre of the inquiry represented a further hurdle			0
‘ it is a very complex investigation , 700 people had access to a crime scene that was never shut			1
‘ and the transient nature of some hospital staff - who may have moved on - is another difficulty we have to face - tracking them down			1
‘ our nightmare was that we could have another death			0
nothing has happened since we got involved			0
' miss @entity20 , 27 , spent more than six weeks in custody after the deaths of five elderly patients were linked to suspected saline drip poisoning			1
she was released last friday when all charges against her were dropped due to lack of evidence			1
her lawyer said she had been made a scapegoat by police who felt under pressure to end the ‘ chaos ’ surrounding the case and that she now wanted to overturn her suspension and return to nursing			1
mr @entity27 admitted his officers had been under pressure , but he insisted the decision to charge her had n’t been rushed by police or the @entity114 ( @entity114 )			2
deaths : from left , @entity117 , 44 , @entity116 , 84 , and @entity119 , 71 , who died at @entity23 in @entity24 security : guards at the entrance to @entity23 , @entity24 ‘ it is common sense that officers were under pressure to make sure there was not another occurrence of contamination at the hospital , ’ he said			0
‘ that did not translate into a decision to charge			0
‘ the @entity114 set high standards			0
the evidence was assessed by the @entity114 who still decided to charge			2
’ mr @entity27 also controversially backed a call from leading barrister @entity138 for crime suspects to be given anonymity			0
wrongly accused : @entity141 was arrested after the death of his tenant @entity144 he used as an example the case of @entity147 , the landlord who was arrested for the murder of @entity149 in @entity150 and later freed without being charged			0
‘ it is really difficult when you see senior detectives agonising over whether to make an arrest or not			2
‘ realising that this is what 's going to happen , that there 's going to be a media furore and this person 's reputation is going to be completely ruined			0
‘ i do n't want to comment about this particular case , but in general there was the case in @entity150 where the landlord got horribly portrayed in the media and eventually was found completely innocent			0
‘ so i totally support what the @entity167 has said i think there should be a ban on people certainly until they 've been charged			2
’ fans of @entity7 ’s well - loved crime novel will know that @entity10 establishes the unlikely solution to the mystery facing him - that all 12 suspects took part in the ' @entity8 '			2
police in @entity24 are continuing to probe the deaths of @entity117 , 44 , @entity119 , 71 , and @entity181 , 83 , and the deaths of a further four unnamed victims			2
officers believe another 33 people may also have been potential victims of contamination but survived .			0

all charges against 27 - year - old @entity20 dropped due to lack of evidence
