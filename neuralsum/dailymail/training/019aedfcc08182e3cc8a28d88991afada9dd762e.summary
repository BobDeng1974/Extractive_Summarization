take your eyes off her for a second and she ’s darted behind a table or started to climb up the sofa			2
her brother , @entity6 , is sleeping peacefully , but @entity7 , the third little bundle of fluff , is having none of it			2
he pounces on @entity6 ’s legs , beseeching him to come and play			2
this charming scene is being played out at @entity15 in @entity16 , where these three 12 - week - old kittens , with their gorgeous olive eyes , sleek black coats ( @entity0 less so , perhaps — she looks as if she ’s plugged herself into an electric socket ) and inquisitive natures are waiting to be rehomed			1
their owner managed to find new homes for their other siblings , a ginger and a tabby , but they were left behind except they ’ll wait			0
for despite their tender age , these innocent creatures have already committed what equates to a cardinal sin when it comes to finding a new home : they ’ve been born with black fur			1
sadly , people just do n’t want black cats — no matter how cute			1
the @entity47 revealed this week that 70 per cent of more than 1,000 cats in care in @entity50 are black , or black and white			1
the problem has got so bad it ’s been dubbed ‘ @entity52 ’			0
the charity claims that black cats ’ diminishing popularity is down to our modern obsession with photographing our lives and putting the snaps on social networking sites — the ‘ selfie ’ phenomenon			1
it seems black cats do n’t photograph well , so would - be pet owners are opting for more photogenic colours			1
while this may be something of an overstatement , our preoccupation with image is certainly behind the worrying trend that is seeing so many black cats abandoned			1
pick me ! @entity74 found himself taken to @entity75 , @entity76 , because he was being bullied by other cats in his old home			2
now he 's a confident and friendly little chap , who loves to explore i need love : @entity80 , nine ( left ) , has been at @entity81 for a month			1
he 's timid and gentle , but no one has given him and his sister @entity83 a second glance			0
@entity85 ( right ) and her kittens were taken in by @entity87			0
the kittens are gone - but not playful @entity85 @entity90 stuff : @entity91 ( left ) and @entity92 ( right ) , now 15 weeks old , have been left behind at the @entity94 branch of @entity87 while their tortoiseshell sister and ginger brother have gone to new homes ‘ the problem for black cats is that they ’re a bit too plain compared to the many other interesting colours available , ’ says @entity98 , chairman of the @entity99 , the @entity50 ’s premier cat registration body			1
‘ black cats are seen as just too dull			1
’ consequently , animal shelters get potential adopters refusing even to look at them			0
others dump them , complaining they ‘ do n’t match the furniture ’ , they ’ve ‘ just ’ discovered they ’re not allowed to keep animals in their home or that they ’ll ‘ frighten the children ’			0

all the @entity47 cats mentioned are at the @entity124 branch : 0207 272 2264			2
but those cats are the lucky ones			2
other black cats have been thrown off balconies or shot with air rifles			1
earlier this week , nine black kittens were found dumped near a football stadium in @entity76 — starving , soaking wet and crawling with fleas			2
at @entity81 , black cats spend longer at the shelter — 34 days compared to the average 25 — while they wait for a new home			1
‘ about one in five people who come in say : “ i do n’t want to see any black cats , ” ’ says @entity136 , head of the centre ’s cattery			1
‘ it ’s frustrating , because it should n’t be about what a cat looks like			0
what really matters is the chemistry it has with the owner			0
’ @entity87 , the @entity50 ’s biggest cat charity , has even launched @entity151 in an attempt to convince people that sleek black felines can be as cute as other varieties			2
staff at @entity81 believe @entity0 , @entity6 and @entity7 , who were brought in last week , would already have found their ‘ for ever homes ’ if they ’d been a different colour			1
doubly cuddly : @entity161 ( left ) and @entity162 ( right ) were dumped at @entity75 in @entity116 and are two months old			0
they are very sociable and would be good for a family with children no takers : @entity167 ( left ) , now a lively six months old , was part of an unwanted litter			0
his owner failed to sell him online , so she 's left him in care at @entity81			1
@entity172 ( right ) , who is at @entity75 in @entity118 , lost an eye in a car crash five years ago			0
potential adopters seem put off by his appearance their mother had five kittens : one tabby , one ginger and the three black ones			2
‘ the owner tried to sell them online : two went , but the black ones did n’t , so she brought them to us , ’ says @entity136			2
‘ that ’s quite common			0
black kittens are the least desirable — you ca n’t give them away			2
’ the most sought - after colour at @entity81 is grey , followed by tabby or ginger			1
while cattery staff keep a ‘ look - out list ’ of what types of feline adopters are searching for , black cats are rarely requested			1
‘ they tell us a black cat would look too much like their neighbour ’s pet , ’ says @entity136			2
‘ one person said , “ i ’m worried i ’ll trip over it in the night , ” and people still bring up the superstition that black cats are unlucky			1
’ of course , black cats did n’t always have an image problem			1
the @entity216 adored the species , and sailors traditionally venerated black cats because they were thought to bring good luck to the ship			1
no one knows how many black cats there are in @entity50 or what percentage of the cat population they make up — but they ’re certainly over-represented in animal shelters			1
the @entity75 , which runs four animal hospitals and 12 rehoming centres across the country , has seen a 65 per cent rise in the number of black cats needing new homes in recent years			1
in 2007 , 540 were brought through their doors , while last year it was 895			0
already this year they ’ve helped 506			0
they , too , blame our modern obsession with looks and creating attention - grabbing photographs for social media			0
‘ black cats have always been trickier to photograph , and this may have made them less popular with the selfie generation , ’ says @entity244 , head of rehoming services			1
as with @entity81 , so @entity75 ’s darker charges spend a lot longer waiting for a home : on average , 40 per cent longer			1
@entity253 , 13 , has spent even longer than that — a staggering 300 days in a @entity256 shelter			1
if she were a different colour , it would have been nearer 35 days			2
lovely 17 - year - old @entity259 has been languishing at the @entity115 centre in @entity76 , for two months , ever since her owner died			0
lost soul : @entity263 was an abandoned kitten found wandering around a local garden and sent to @entity81			1
she 's only a year old and would certainly make someone a loving and friendly pet			0
@entity268 ( right ) is a serene , nine - year - old cat who just longs to live with a young family			0
unlike many cats , she loves being with children			2
she 's been patiently waiting at @entity81 for three weeks appealing : part of an unwanted litter taken to @entity120 in @entity121 six weeks ago , this 12 - week - old female ( left ) does n't have a name yet , but the inquisitive little girl is desperate to be cared for			1
@entity279 , three ( right ) , was abandoned at @entity75 in @entity115 , @entity76 , and has been there of seven months			0
all he wants is a loving home of course , she is elderly , too — something which also counts against her			0
some cats do n’t just spend months waiting for a new home , but years			1
brother and sister @entity287 and @entity253 were timid strays when they were brought into the @entity291 centre outside @entity292 , @entity293 , as six - month - olds			0
now , four years on , they ’ve blossomed into delightful , playful creatures to be adopted together , but no one wants them because of their dark colour			0
the prejudice against black cats is particularly silly , says @entity302 , who works for the @entity47 in @entity16 , because they often make far more affectionate pets than other colours , so potential homers are missing out			1
‘ so many times , our black cats have been overlooked purely because of their colour , even when they ’ve done everything they can to win over the adopter , ’ she says			1
‘ black cats , in our experience , are often the ones that have been the worst sufferers of abuse and neglect			1
yet some of the nicest cats here have had the hardest start in life			2
’ the @entity47 ’s roll call of abused black cats is as heart - breaking as it is long			1
there ’s 15 - week - old @entity259 and @entity330 , best friends left starving in a cat carrier in a bush in @entity16 ; ten - week - old @entity333 and @entity334 , who were thrown off a third - floor balcony together ; and nine - month - old @entity336 , who was found minus an eye — possibly because of an air gun pellet			2
meanwhile , 14 - week - old @entity340 was abandoned in a park in a box			0
‘ she loves her tummy being stroked and under her chin , too , ’ says a member of staff			0
‘ she just loves to be fussed over			0
’ sadly , a charming personality is n’t enough to win over potential owners who have decided they definitely do n’t want a black cat for aesthetic reasons			2
all deserve the chance of a better life — if only someone would give them a chance .			0

around 70 per cent of cats in care are either black or black and white
thought to be because they are too plain compared to other colours
at @entity81 , black cats spend on average ten days longer at shelter
