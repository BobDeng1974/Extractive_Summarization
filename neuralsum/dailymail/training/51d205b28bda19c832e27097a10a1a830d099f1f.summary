but the director of football , who had been verbally abused , along with @entity20 , during the 3 - 0 home defeat , was not even at the ground			1
as a result of the stand - off , @entity5 ambassador and former captain @entity50 stepped in to appease sponsors for the event			2
further details were published by @entity54 claiming the breakdown of @entity4 ’s relationship with @entity20 had forced his resignation on monday evening			1
the pair were seen at several games together this season laughing and joking and they had intended to attend the derby together but changed their mind following the sale of @entity65 to @entity66 , and the anticipated backlash from supporters unhappy that @entity5 had failed to sign a replacement for the @entity71 midfielder			1
one that got away : @entity65 left for @entity66 and was not replaced in january really ? @entity4 claimed he was closing on @entity73 despite the forward already being a @entity76 player that deal proved the final straw for @entity20 because @entity4 agreed a fee for @entity65			1
the pair clashed last week following the sale for less than the £ 25million @entity20 expected , believed to be around the £ 20m mark			2
it is also reported that @entity4 privately claimed @entity5 were going to sign @entity84 last month for £ 25m after a deal had already been struck with @entity76 for less than half that figure			1
the hierarchy at the @entity89 club had grown tired of the way @entity4 operated			2
how he told punters in the @entity92 the night before @entity5 were beaten by @entity93 in january that he had £ 20m to spend on a striker , a boast that reached and infuriated @entity20			1
how he struggled with technology , such as using the internet , and had endless problems with his mobile phone			0
how he claimed on a train earlier this season as he headed to watch a @entity5 match that he had to call off a drinking night with @entity103 to wine and dine the @entity105			0
missing the boat : @entity107 ( centre ) was lined up as a potential replacement for countryman @entity65 brief : @entity4 's short - live spell as manager came to an end shortly after his shock appointment how he told fans not to worry about selling @entity116 because he had three world class goalkeepers lined up			1

it turned out to be @entity118			0
@entity4 was appointed by @entity20 as the replacement for departing managing director @entity129 last summer			1
his appointment stunned supporters who thought they had seen the last of a manager who had been forced to quit through ill health four years earlier			0
that turbulent reign eventually led to @entity5 ’s relegation from the @entity136			0
no worries ? @entity4 was nonplussed by the possibility of @entity116 ( centre ) leaving , claiming he had other goalkeepers in the pipeline that bad ? @entity142 ( left ) was brought in on loan but @entity4 failed to make a single permanent signing @entity4 was brought in to oversee transfers and , after spending £ 33m last january on five @entity147 players , @entity20 was eager to cut back on spending			1
and @entity5 spent just £ 2m on a loan fee for @entity150 ’s @entity142			2
@entity65 – or ‘ kebab ’ , as @entity4 had humiliating dubbed him in his first interview in his new job – was sold last week at a reduced price and it was @entity156 who had to answer the uncomfortable questions			2
the @entity5 manager , who had no idea @entity4 had quit until he too heard the news late on monday night , will have to answer more awkward questions when he meets the media on thursday afternoon			2
his hope is that he and chief scout @entity165 will have more say in recruitment this summer			0
they are certainly all looking to move forward from another turbulent period in the club ’s recent history .			0
