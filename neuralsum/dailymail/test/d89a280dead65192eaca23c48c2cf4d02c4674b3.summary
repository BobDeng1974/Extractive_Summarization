it may sound like the stuff of science fiction , but this stunning image shows that a white dwarf star ripped apart a planet as it came too close			1
astronomers say the unique event happened in an ancient cluster of stars at the edge of the @entity12 galaxy			1
a white dwarf star - the dense core of a star like the @entity16 that has run out of nuclear fuel - may have ripped apart a planet as it came too close , they believe			1
@entity19 says a white dwarf star - the dense core of a star like the @entity16 that has run out of nuclear fuel - ripped apart a planet at the edge of the @entity12 galaxy			1
when a star reaches its white dwarf stage , nearly all of the material from the star is packed inside a radius one hundredth that of the original star			1
this means that , for close encounters , the gravitational pull of the star and the associated tides , caused by the difference in gravity 's pull on the near and far side of the planet , are greatly enhanced			0
for example , the gravity at the surface of a white dwarf is over ten thousand times higher than the gravity at the surface of the @entity16 using several telescopes , including @entity19 's @entity51 , researchers have found evidence that a white dwarf star - the dense core of a star like the @entity16 that has run out of nuclear fuel - may have ripped apart a planet as it came too close			1

for example , the gravity at the surface of a white dwarf is over ten thousand times higher than the gravity at the surface of the @entity16 ' a planet is first pulled away from its parent star by the gravity of the dense concentration of stars in a globular cluster , ' the experts write			1
' when such a planet passes too close to a white dwarf , it can be torn apart by the intense tidal forces of the white dwarf			1
' the planetary debris is then heated and glows in @entity85 as it falls onto the white dwarf			1
' the observed amount of x-rays emitted at different energies agrees with expectations for a tidal disruption event			0

@entity97 6388 in the x-ray spectrum			0
@entity51 's excellent x-ray vision enabled the astronomers to determine that the x-rays from @entity97 were not coming from the putative black hole at the center of the cluster , but instead from a location slightly off to one side			0
optical observations had hinted that an intermediate - mass black hole with mass equal to several hundred @entity16 or more resides at the center of @entity97			2
the new composite image shows @entity97 with x-rays detected by @entity51 in pink and visible light from the @entity115 in red , green , and blue , with many of the stars appearing to be orange or white			2
overlapping x-ray sources and stars near the center of the cluster also causes the image to appear white			2
with the central black hole ruled out as the potential x-ray source , the hunt continued for clues about the actual source in @entity97			0
the source was monitored with the x-ray telescope on board @entity19 's @entity129 mission for about 200 days after the discovery by @entity93			0
researchers used the @entity94 's @entity93 ( @entity93 ) to discover a new x-ray source near the center of the globular cluster @entity97			0
the source became dimmer during the period of @entity129 observations			0
the rate at which the x-ray brightness dropped agrees with theoretical models of a disruption of a planet by the gravitational tidal forces of a white dwarf			1
in these models , a planet is first pulled away from its parent star by the gravity of the dense concentration of stars in a globular cluster			2
when such a planet passes too close to a white dwarf , it can be torn apart by the intense tidal forces of the white dwarf			2
the planetary debris is then heated and glows in @entity85 as it falls onto the white dwarf			2
the observed amount of x-rays emitted at different energies agrees with expectations for a tidal disruption event			0
the researchers estimate that the destroyed planet would have contained about a third of the mass of @entity166 , while the white dwarf has about 1.4 times the @entity16 's mass. while the case for the tidal disruption of a planet is not iron - clad , the argument for it was strengthened when astronomers used data from the multiple telescopes to help eliminate other possible explanations for the detected x-rays			1
for example , the source does not show some of the distinctive features of a binary containing a neutron star , such as pulsations or rapid x-ray bursts			0
also , the source is much too faint in radio waves to be part of a binary system with a stellar - mass black hole .			0
