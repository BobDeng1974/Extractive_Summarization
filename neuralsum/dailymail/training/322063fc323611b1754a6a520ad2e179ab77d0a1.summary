soldiers could soon be equipped with @entity2 - style helmets that help them pinpoint targets quickly and easily on the battlefield			1
the @entity6 helmet - mounted display , designed by defence contractor @entity7 , uses similar technology to that used by jet pilots in fighter planes and mimics the display used in the @entity15 films			1
it ’s currently undergoing tests in the @entity18 , but military researchers have said the tech is ‘ already exceeding expectations			1
' soldiers could soon be equipped with @entity2 - style helmets that help them pinpoint targets quickly and easily on the battlefield			1
the @entity6 helmet - mounted display , pictured , uses similar technology to that used by jet pilots in fighter planes to track the landscape ahead the helmet - mounted display is fitted with an optical screen that sits in front of the soldier 's left eye			1
this display creates 3d images , that are positioned in such a way that they appear to sit in the real world			0
images from @entity42 cameras and other surveillance sensors , as well as data from nearby vehicles , is beamed directly onto the display			0
additionally , the display will highlight compass directions and targets , as well as colleagues , to prevent friendly fire attacks			1
the battery - powered @entity52 is fitted with an infrared camera , a video recorder and gps unit			1
a head - up display , or @entity52 , is a transparent display that presents data within the wearer ’s line of sight			0
the technology was originally developed for military pilots but is now used in commercial planes , gaming , and cars			2
for example , the @entity52 beams directions onto a person ’s windscreen and can track their eye movements to make sure the driver spends minimal time looking away from the road			0
created by engineers at @entity78 business in @entity79 , it is hoped the @entity6 technology will give soldiers and members of the special forces more real - time visual data than ever before			2
the q - warrior ’s high - resolution , see - through display allows waypoints , points of interest , and targets to be displayed over what a soldier can see in front of them			2
@entity6 helmet the principle behind the @entity6 technology is similar to what @entity98 , pictured , used in the film @entity15			1
the q - warrior display creates @entity104 images , uses images and data from surveillance sensors and highlights compass directions , as well as colleagues to prevent friendly fire attacks the battery - powered @entity52 , pictured , is fitted with an infrared camera , a video recorder and gps unit it is expected to be used by section commanders , but could one day become a standard piece of kit for soldiers			1
@entity121 , soldier systems ’ business development lead at @entity7 ’ @entity78 in @entity122 , said : ‘ @entity6 increases the user ’s situational awareness by providing the potential to display ‘ eyes - out ’ information to the user , including textual information , warnings and threats			1
' other key features include enhanced night vision , waypoints and routing information , and the ability to track both personnel and assets			0
' the biggest demand , in the short term at least , will be in roles where the early adoption of situational awareness technology offers a defined advantage			0
' this is likely to be within non-traditional military units with reconnaissance roles , such as @entity148 ( @entity149 ) or with special forces during counter terrorist tasks			0
' the next level of adoption could be light role troops such as airborne forces or marines , where technical systems and aggression help to overcome their lighter equipment			0
' many have compared the new helmets to the high - tech equipment used in films such as @entity15			2
@entity121 added : ‘ @entity15 presented an unachievable , invincible warrior capability but modern technology such as q - warrior is starting to bring some of that capability to the next generation of specialist soldiers			0
’ a head - up display , or @entity52 , is a transparent display that presents data within the wearer 's line of sight			0
the technology was originally developed for military pilots , seen here on the co-pilot display of a @entity181 plane , but is now used in commercial planes , cars , and gaming			2

@entity6 helmet mounted display system was developed by @entity7
it can help soldiers pinpoint targets and waypoints during conflicts
similar tech is already used by pilots , and featured in the @entity2 films
military researchers claim the helmet is ' exceeding expectations in tests '
the battery - powered display comes with a gps unit and video camera
it will also highlight nearby *comrades* to avoid friendly fire attacks
