@entity1 , the majority owner of the @entity4 @entity3 basketball team , has made an approach to @entity6 which may lead to an offer being made for the company , the club has announced to the @entity9			1
reports emerged on sunday that an £ 18million takeover bid from @entity1 had either been lodged or was about to be and on monday the club confirmed interest from the 53 - year - old			1
' @entity15 notes recent press speculation and confirms that it has received an approach from @entity1 ( or a vehicle to be established and controlled by him ) ( ' mr @entity19 ' ) that may or may not lead to an offer being made for the @entity15 , ' @entity6 said			1
@entity4 owner @entity1 is preparing an £ 18m takeover bid for @entity6 @entity1 , 53 , must either make an offer for the @entity25 club or withdraw his bid by february 2 ' there can be no certainty that an offer will be made , nor as to the terms on which an offer may be made			1
a further announcement is expected shortly			0
' the statement added that @entity1 must make an offer or withdraw his bid by 5pm on february 2			1
it is another twist to a seemingly never - ending saga , but it is understood the financier may now be prepared to back @entity39 and the ' @entity42 ' group 's attempts to seize control of the club			2
he lodged his offer in an email to @entity48 chairman @entity47 just after @entity49			2
@entity1 - a keen sports fan whose sons are interested in the game - asked the @entity6 board to call a general meeting to vote on a plan which would have seen enough new shares issued to hand him a 51 per cent stake			1
the financier is reportedly prepared to back @entity39 and the ' @entity42 ' group 's attempts to take control he was also prepared to spend up to £ 15m buying out any remaining shareholders as he sought a 100 per cent stake in the club			2
@entity1 , who also owns the @entity68 women 's @entity3 team , submitted his offer at the same time to @entity70 , which manages @entity48 's listing on the @entity72			1
but it remains to be seen if he will press ahead with his bid after former oldco director king followed the ' @entity42 ' group of @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79 in buying up significant tranches of equity last week			0
@entity39 now holds a 14.57 per cent share , while @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79 are responsible for 19 per cent			0
@entity39 , seen here at the @entity83 vs @entity85 match , now holds a 14.57 per cent share it is understood the @entity42 have had tentative talks with @entity1 but there is no deal in place			2
however , it seems unlikely that he will now be able to take control of the club following the moves made by @entity39 and the @entity42			2
at least 75 per cent of shareholders would have to agree to new shares being issued to a non-shareholder at a general meeting , after resolution nine was defeated at the annual general meeting in december			0
@entity47 has already rejected a £ 16m investment plan offered by @entity39 which would have seen the @entity104 - based businessman receive a controlling stake and seats on the board			0
the confirmation of the approach came as @entity6 revealed they had secured a loan of up to £ 500,000 from shareholder and football club chairman @entity112			1
@entity114 's loan will be secured on future income from the recent sale of @entity117 to @entity118			0
the midfielder went for an undisclosed fee that was reported as £ 1m			0
a separate statement to the @entity9 read : ' the company is pleased to announce that it has entered into a short term credit facility for up to £ 0.5m			0
the facility is being provided by @entity114 , a shareholder in the company and director of @entity128 , the wholly owned subsidiary of @entity48			0
the facility will be used by the company for general working capital purposes over the next few days			0
' @entity131 will make available to the company up to £ 500,000 on a fee and interest free basis and it will be secured against the income from the sale of player announced on 2 january 2015			1

@entity4 owner @entity1 has made an approach to @entity6
it could lead to an offer worth £ 18m being made for the @entity144 club
the 53 - year - old @entity1 has either lodged or is about to lodge a bid
@entity1 must either make an offer or withdraw his bid before february 2
