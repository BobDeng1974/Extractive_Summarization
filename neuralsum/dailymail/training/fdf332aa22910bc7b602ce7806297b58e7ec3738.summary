by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity3 boss @entity2 hopes the experience of earning promotion against the odds can stand his players in good stead for the tests to come in the @entity10			1
the @entity3 have no chance to ease themselves into the top flight with likely title challengers @entity11 the first visitors to @entity17 on monday evening			1
much has been made of the considerable differences between the two clubs , but @entity2 expects his players to meet the challenge head on			1
looking back to the 2 - 0 win over @entity23 in april that clinched promotion for @entity3 , the manager said : ' there were some big games last year , people forget that			1
prepared : @entity2 said big games during their promotion have prepared them for the @entity10 ' we played @entity23 and delivered a fantastic performance , and that 's probably the biggest game these players have played in a long time , because that one clinches what you 're trying to do , and that means a lot to the club , a lot financially , a lot to the area , and of course the kudos of getting promoted			1
' it 's fair to say the first one against @entity11 , massive club , coming to @entity17 under the lights with the tv cameras , that 's a big game in itself			1
' so it 's how the players respond			2
we work hard on the training pitch to allow them the chance to deliver when that moment comes			0
' @entity2 knows they must make the most of @entity17 to give themselves the best possible chance of survival			1
celebration : @entity2 and his @entity3 players after their match against @entity23 which got them promoted in their only previous season in the @entity10 , in 2009/10 , @entity3 picked up 26 points at home , but only four away and were relegated			1
' i got the feeling last season that there was a true belief with the fans and the player connection , ' said @entity2			1
' i think they really felt they had a group who were totally motivated towards the shirt and the club and the cause			0
they 've come to really understand that and the positivity around that			0
' they certainly will know we need that because the task has gone up again			0
we want the fans to stay with us of course and they did do last season , even when we had a couple of testing times at home			2
' we 'd go a goal down and there was a calmness to the stadium , a belief that the group would keep going			0
opener : @entity2 's first @entity10 game will be against @entity106 's @entity11 ' we 're renowned for that , we are relentless in the way that we work and the way we approach games and deliver			1
we 're looking to make sure that 's still intact			0
' if @entity11 fans expect to ease to three points on monday , they would do well to remember the fate that befell @entity116 in august 2009			1
the @entity117 were the first team to visit @entity17 that season and were beaten 1 - 0 , @entity119 scoring the only goal , while @entity121 saved a penalty			1
@entity2 has clearly heard the story many times since joining the club in 2012 , but is not about to promise a repeat			2
friendlies : @entity3 have only lost one of their pre-season games over the summer ' we ca n't guarantee that , ' he said			2
' the size of some of the clubs we 're coming across , some of the players , no guarantees from us			2
' but what we are looking to guarantee is that we 're ready , we 're able , we 're certainly mentally and physically motivated to go and deliver performances			0
where that takes us we 'll only know once the season gets off and running			2
' there 's always confidence because you believe in how you work , your staff work and your players work			0
that 's what coaching and management is about			0
' but you can only get to that point when you 're ready			0
when that whistle blows , it really is down to players and how they perform			0
that 's the magic moment			0
' we 're obviously looking to show we can at least be competitive , give good performances and see where that takes us			0
