miss @entity5 was told the heavy bleeding she was experiencing was ' normal ' normally , the placenta separates from the uterine wall during delivery and is expelled from the vagina within 20 minutes after giving birth			1
if pieces of the placenta remain in the uterus ( called retained placenta ) , it can lead to infection			0

' miss @entity5 has written to the head of midwifery at the hospital to complain about what happened and is considering taking legal action			1

' a @entity101 spokesman said : ' we are investigating the circumstances around the care and treatment of ms @entity5			2
