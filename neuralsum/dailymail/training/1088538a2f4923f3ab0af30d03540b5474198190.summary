@entity0 claims he ' feels fantastic ' ahead of his long - awaited return to competitive golf this week			1
@entity0 heads into the @entity3 at @entity4 & @entity5 in @entity6 on thursday , the tournament he annually hosts which benefits his foundation , with a new coach who is in the process of changing his swing			1
during his four months out of action following surgery on a herniated disc in his back , the 39 - year - old turned to @entity19 , who he refers to as a ' consultant ' , after spending the last four years with @entity21			1
@entity0 speaks at a press conference on tuesday afternoon at @entity4 in @entity6 @entity0 insists he remains ' very good friends ' with @entity21 , but that he needed to do something different			1
it was another old friend in @entity26 who recommended @entity19 , with @entity28 adding at tuesday 's press conference : ' i was very surprised and excited to see how he felt my swing should look like			1
' it was very similar to the vision i had , and that 's where we 're at right now			0
' asked for detail on the swing , @entity0 added with a smile : ' it is new , but it is old			1
i say that because i have n't done it in a very long time			2
' we looked at a lot of video from when i was a junior , amateur , and it was interesting to see how my swing was then and how much force i could generate with a very skinny frame			2
' how did i do that ? how did i generate that much power ? that 's what we are getting back into			2
' as to how long the changes will take i do n't know			0
i am curious to find that out myself , too			0
' woods was last seen in action during a sorry , injury - plagued performance at the @entity59 the swing change is as a result of the injuries that have taken their toll on @entity0 over the years			1
but as he noted : ' i 'm older			0
' we all eventually start losing some of the things we were able to do when we were younger			0
' as an athlete you do notice these things and we all have to make adaptations and adjustments , and i 'm no different			2
' i 'm not quite 40 yet - that 's not until next year - so i still have some time			2
' @entity0 has not played competitive golf since failing to make the cut at the @entity59 in august , following which he decided to take some out to get his mind , body and game into better shape			1
that exit was only @entity0 ' fourth tournament since undergoing back surgery on march 31 to cure a pinched nerve			1
the @entity86 remains the last major of 14 won by @entity0 with injuries having beset his career since @entity0 is adamant his back is now cured and is confident there will be no repetition of the injury which has seen him plummet from world no 1 at the start of the year to no 24			1
' it feels great , it feels fantastic , ' said @entity0 , who finished 201st on the money list this year with ' meagre ' earnings of just Â£ 69,000			2
' i 've gotten stronger , more explosive , i 've gotten faster and now i just need to hit more balls			2
' but the body is good			0
i do n't have the sharp pain like i had at the beginning of the year			0
' i still have some aches and pains , like anybody else my age and older			0
' but i can play with my kids , do whatever i want			0
i 've played a ton of soccer in the backyard			0
' am i game - ready ? probably not quite as i would like to be			0
i have n't played a tournament round since august ' @entity0 hits a drive during his very first major victory , as a 21 - year - old at the masters in 1997 @entity0 achieved notable success and tremendous power despite having a slender frame when younger woods , meanwhile , has admitted surprise at the creation of a @entity123 task force by the @entity124 following the @entity126 ' latest humiliating defeat to @entity127 earlier this year			1
as a member of the 11 - man panel , @entity0 said : ' did i ever think we would end up in this position with a task force ? no. ' our job going forward is we only have this task force once			1
it 's so we have a process in place where everyone is happy with the selection of not only the players , but also the captains , assistant captains			0
' if we do our job correctly we 're only going to have this once			0
