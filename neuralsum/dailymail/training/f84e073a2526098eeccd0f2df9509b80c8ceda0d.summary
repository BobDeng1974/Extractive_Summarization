@entity1 firefighter @entity8 has told the @entity3 inquest that he was ' dumbfounded ' at the lack of help for stricken fans as disaster struck mr @entity8 , who gave evidence at the inquest in his @entity33 uniform , said after the match was abandoned he left his seat in the stand above the @entity15 terrace and made his way to the pitch			1
he said : ' i was dumbfounded , the fact that by the time i got on the pitch , it was enough time to get some emergency response			1
' mr @entity8 said while there , he saw a local firefighter in uniform with an oxygen cylinder			1
he continued : ' i asked him , i said , " where are all the firefighters ? " ' he said a phrase , something like , " there 's 10 or 12 appliances outside , they think there 's a major riot going on "			0
' by then it was getting really frustrating			0
' mr @entity8 said when he first got on the pitch he had been given a green first aid armband by a @entity63 man and told , ' go and see what you can do			1
' he continued : ' what i witnessed was something unbelievable			0
the @entity23 fan , who had been a fireman with @entity24 for three years at the time of the match , said he was ' amazed ' at the lack of response from emergency services at @entity3 ' there was so many that was in need of care i felt so isolated			1
' there 's people lying all over this pitch and a line of police officers right across the middle and some police officers here helping with fans			2
' this should not be happening , there should be some more response			2
i do n't think all the time i was there , there was no great organisation			0
' i would not want to use swear words but it was absolute chaos			1
i was just amazed at the lack of emergency response			1
' mr @entity8 found he could do nothing to save a number of fans but gave chest compressions and mouth to mouth resuscitation to a number of others before helping to carry an injured fan to the stadium gym - hastily turned into a casualty station and mortuary			1
@entity114 , counsel to the inquest , asked the witness : ' when you went in the gym , what did you see ? ' mr @entity8 said : ' it just seemed like chaos			1
' the thing i will always remember is the way there was bodies just laid out in a strange order			0
a young @entity23 fan looks at tributes left at the @entity3 25th @entity131 in april ' dead and alive in the same vicinity			1
' he was told if he found no sign of life in an injured fan to put a t - shirt over that person 's head			2
he then stayed with a young fan who was shouting , ' am i going to die ? ' to reassure him and telephone his mother to let her know he was still alive			0
the disaster , in 1989 , claimed the lives of 96 people			1
earlier the inquest jury heard from @entity149 , an experienced football writer for a national newspaper who was reporting on the match from the press box in the main stand at the game			0
mr @entity149 said around 15 minutes before kick - off , he noticed the build up of fans in the central pens of the @entity15 terrace behind the goal where the fans were crushed , and used a pair of binoculars to scan the scene as the disaster unfolded			1
mr @entity149 , a sports journalist for 27 years at the time , said : ' you get a feeling for these things when you have been going around football matches four , five times a week			0
you get a feeling for when things are brewing			0
it 's almost like an instinct			0
i felt it that day			0
' i said to a @entity23 radio colleague , " i do n't like the look of what 's going on around there "			2
' he agreed there was an ' extraordinary imbalance ' between the central pens which were ' absolutely heaving ' but plenty of room in the pens either side			0
fans hold up scarves during the memorial service to mark the 25th anniversary of @entity3 at @entity195 stadium , in april this year mr @entity149 said : ' it appears people were in the wrong pens			1
they should be balanced across the whole ( terrace )			0
' he was asked about police reaction as it became apparent disaster was looming			0
mr @entity149 replied : ' well there did not seem to be any			0
i was actually shouting in the press box , " open the gates ! " yet nobody opened the gates			0
i just could not understand it			0
' mr @entity149 agreed officers on the ground appeared to ' lack organisation and leadership , ' and after the match was abandoned at 3.06pm the scene on the pitch was , ' chaotic			1
totally chaotic , ' with the police , ' extremely slow to react to what was happening '			0
mr @entity149 agreed in a statement he gave earlier this year he described the @entity3 as ' not fit for purpose ' to host the @entity18 semi-final			1
the witness said the ground was not used to having full houses of 50,000 fans and it was ' common sense ' @entity23 fans should have been given the much larger @entity231 end of the @entity17 ground not the @entity15 end			2
the witness said he was a well known journalist and @entity236 fan and had spoken to @entity23 fans before the game			1
he said : ' it was all very friendly banter , as it always is with @entity23 fans			2
' mr @entity149 was then asked about other witnesses , including police officers , who said they could smell alcohol on the @entity23 fans			2
he replied : ' i have to say whenever a football match is organised at whatever level , you can smell alcohol because fans have a drink before a match			0
' he added : ' i have been a student of football for 50 years and i have to say at this point , in my view , @entity23 football fans are some of the best in the country ... they understand the game , they 're passionate about the game , they are amusing			2
you get a bad egg in every few dozen if you want , but overall i think @entity23 fans do themselves justice at home and abroad			2
' the hearing was adjourned until tomorrow morning			0
