by @entity0 published : 11:19 est , 28 april 2012 updated : 08:47 est , 30 april 2012 scientists say they have found one of the world 's oldest living organisms and man 's remotest relative - after spending two decades examining a microscopic algae - eater that lives in a lake in @entity7			1
they have even had to invent a new category of organism for it called @entity12 because it is not an animal , plant , parasite , fungus or alga , they said			1
they said the elusive , single - cell creature evolved about a billion years ago			1
spot the family resemblance ? the newly identified collodictyon is closer to human beings than to bacteria , according to the @entity7 scientists " we have found an unknown branch of the tree of life that lives in this lake			1
it is unique ! " @entity32 researcher @entity31 said			0
" so far we know of no other group of organisms that descends from closer to the roots of the tree of life than this species			0
" scientists believe the discovery may provide insight into what life looked like on earth hundreds of millions of years ago			1
@entity12 lives in the sludge of a small lake called @entity47 , 30 kilometres south of @entity48			2
glorious mud : the find that scientists said was ' unique ' was made in the sludge of a lake south of @entity48 it has four tail - like propellers it uses to move around called flagella , and at 30 to 50 micrometres ( millionths of a metre ) long it can only be seen with a microscope			2
@entity12 possess cell nuclei enclosed by membranes , which makes them less like bacteria and more like eukaryotes , that is , plants , fungi , algae and animals , including humans			2
using the characteristics of collodictyon , dr @entity31 said scientists inferred that prehistoric eukaryotes were probably a single - cell organism with finger - like structures that it used to catch microscopic prey			1
" they are not sociable creatures , " added co-researcher @entity77 , who bred millions of the tiny organisms for the study			0
" they flourish best alone			0
once they have eaten the food , cannibalism is the order of the day			0
" they have not been found anywhere but in @entity89			0
" it is quite fascinating that we can still find these kinds of organisms after so many years , " @entity31 told @entity90			0
" it has been outside our living rooms for millions of years and we have n't seen it			0
" @entity12 was first found in the lake about 20 years ago by @entity32 scientists who recognised it was unusual but " did n't know how important it was " , he added .			1

creature is ' new category ' of organism
evolved about a billion years ago
microscopic creature in lake in @entity7 , eats algae
