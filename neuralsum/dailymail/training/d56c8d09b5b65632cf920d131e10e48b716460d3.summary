by @entity0 @entity1 : 12:29 est , 12 december 2013 @entity2 : 15:37 est , 12 december 2013 a mother ’s life has been saved by doctors who completely drained her of blood			2
@entity7 , 36 , from @entity8 , suffered a rare condition which caused her arteries to fill with deadly blood clots			1
surgeons had to drain her body of blood to allow them to remove the tiny clots which could have killed her			1
@entity17 's life was saved by doctors who cleared her pulmonary arteries of blood clots after draining the blood from her body and reducing her core body temperature to just 18 degrees they also had to reduce ms @entity7 ’s body temperature from a normal 37 degrees to an incredibly low 18			1
amazingly , she has now made a full recovery and is looking forward to @entity26 with her daughter			0
ms @entity7 said : ‘ when the doctors told me about the operation i was amazed			2
‘ having my blood drained out of me sounded like something out of a horror film			2
i have a little girl and when i thought about the risks it was just awful			0
‘ i just had to remember that it was going to save my life			0
’ ms @entity7 was diagnosed with a condition called pulmonary hypertension			1
ms @entity17 had high blood pressure in her pulmonary artery because it was partially blocked by blood clots			1
this meant the blood could not easily flow through it and caused her to suffer breathlessness and chest pains the condition occurs when the blood pressure in the pulmonary artery increases			1
as in ms @entity7 ’s case , it can be caused by blood clots blocking the artery and making it difficult for blood to flow through it			1
this can cause breathlessness , fatigue , faintness and heart problems			0
pulmonary endarterectomy is a surgical procedure that removes chronic blood clots from the arteries in the lungs			1
it involves the patient being connected to a heart - lung machine that takes over from the heart and lungs during the procedure			1
the patient 's body is then cooled to 18 degrees - down from the normal 37 degrees - to prevent damage while the machine is switched off and the blood is removed from the body			1
while the arteries are briefly emptied of blood , surgeons can remove the clots			1
once this has been done , the patient is warmed up to a normal body temperature and taken off the bypass machine			1
the operation usually takes eight to ten hours			0
she said : ‘ i ’ve always been perfectly healthy but last november i went to @entity90 to visit my grandfather			0
‘ he lives on the top of a hill - which i ’ve always been able to walk up - but i was finding it really difficult			2
‘ i could hardly breathe and it just took me ages - it was then that i knew something was wrong			0
‘ back at home , i was getting really bad chest pains and swelling - my feet were getting enormous - by the summer i could hardly breathe			0
’ initially doctors diagnosed ms @entity7 with a blood clot , but after collapsing at her home , and suffering from chest pains , she was rushed to hospital			1
she said : ‘ at the hospital a cardiologist told me that they needed to contact another hospital to get some advice			0
‘ i was getting really worried because no one seemed to know what was wrong with me and i just did n’t know what was going on			0
‘ they put me in the intensive care unit and i just could n’t understand why - everyone else in there was really ill and i was awake and chatting away			0
’ ms @entity7 was transferred to @entity118 in @entity119 where her condition worsened and she became dependent on breathing support			1
doctors had to use a heart - lung bypass machine to take over the work of her ms @entity7 's heart and lungs			1
the machine drained her arteries of blood meaning the surgeons could remove the clots while the arteries were emptied of blood			1
image ( left ) shows the scar on her chest and ( right ) shows how swollen her feet became she said : ‘ it was at @entity118 where they revealed the true extent of my condition			2
‘ they explained that i ’d been rushed down there because they were the only hospital in the country that could perform the procedure			0
‘ i felt relieved to know that i was in safe hands but i was so scared			0
i was almost inconsolable in the days leading up to the surgery , i was scared i ’d never see my daughter again			0
‘ but the doctors and nurses were fantastic - they did everything they could to make me feel at ease			0
‘ when the day of the operation came on august 14 i was so nervous , but i just had to focus on the bigger picture - i needed this to save my life			2
’ before her life - saving surgery , ms @entity17 's legs became very swollen because of her condition the procedure - known as a pulmonary endarterectomy - involves the patient being put on a heart - lung bypass machine which temporarily takes over the work of the heart and lungs			1
the body is then cooled to a temperature of just 18 degrees to prevent damage caused by the lack of oxygenated blood flowing around the body			1
the surgeons then have just 20 minutes to remove the clots while the arteries are emptied of blood			2
ms @entity180 said : ‘ when i came round i felt better straight away			0
my recovery has gone swimmingly and i ’m finally starting to feel like me again			0
‘ getting to go home , after everything i ’d been through was incredible - it ’s all i ’d wanted all along			0
ms @entity7 said : ' when the doctors told me about the operation i was amazed			2
having my blood drained out of me sounded like something out of a horror film ' ‘ i ’m truly amazed at what the surgeons at @entity118 did for me , they saved my life			1
’ consultant cardiothoracic surgeon @entity196 , who leads the national @entity198 programme , said : ‘ the pulmonary endarterectomy procedure is one of the longest and more complex cardiothoracic operations we perform			2
‘ despite the technical difficulty , this procedure is very satisfying as it transforms lives , improving both quality of life and prognosis			0
‘ it is very rewarding to see patients , like @entity7 , with a new lease of life , after struggling to breathe and do the simplest of things , like walking down the street			0

@entity7 had high blood pressure in her pulmonary artery as it was blocked with clots - meaning blood struggled to flow through it
she needed breathing support , struggled to walk and suffered chest pain
surgeons at @entity118 carried out a *pioneering* operation called pulmonary endarterectomy to remove the clots
they had to put her on a heart - lung machine which drained the blood from her body , and then they cooled her body temperature to 18 degrees
this gave them the chance to clear her artery while no blood was in it
cooling her body prevented damage being caused by the lack of blood
