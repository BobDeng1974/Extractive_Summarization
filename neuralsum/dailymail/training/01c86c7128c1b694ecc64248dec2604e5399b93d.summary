by @entity0 created 3:15 pm on 14th september 2011 a @entity2 adviser today compared the eviction of residents at @entity7 's largest illegal travellers ' site to the plight of millions in @entity9 as he accused a council of ' violating international law '			1
in an extraordinary visit to @entity14 , in @entity15 , professor @entity12 claimed @entity16 had broken human rights legislation in three ways			1
speaking outside one of the traveller 's homes , with the @entity2 flag hoisted behind him , the @entity2 adviser for forced evictions also drew parallels with @entity27 and @entity28 - both notorious for human rights abuses			1
' human rights violation ' : @entity2 adviser @entity12 , front , held a press conference at @entity14 travellers ' site he also said that it was the council , not the @entity14 residents , who were ' abusing the law ' , despite the presence of 400 people on illegal plots at the site			1
those living at the site illegally are due to be evicted from monday , but despite claims this will leave them homeless it was revealed today that one of the @entity14 travellers is masterminding a multi-million - pound property development in @entity51			1
professor @entity12 said : ' a study which i led on forced eviction found that at @entity14 , and the @entity57 in general , the government is violating international human rights law on three points			1
' these are the right to adequate housing , the right to be defended from forced eviction and discrimination			0
' prof @entity12 argued that @entity16 had failed to provide the pitches it should make available to travellers			1
outburst : prof @entity69 , speaking in front of the @entity2 flag , compared the eviction to human - rights abuses in @entity9 , @entity27 and @entity28 conference : residents and @entity76 watch the @entity2 adviser 's controversial speech he added : ' the people who are abusing the law are the council , not the travellers			1
the council is not fulfilling its duties			1
' there are many @entity86 which face these issues every day and there needs to be a co-ordinated approach across the country			0
' we are used to see millions of people losing their homes in @entity9 , @entity27 and @entity28 - how is one country unable to solve the problem of 51 pitches ? ' his visit came as there were signs of travellers beginning to leave the site voluntarily			1
at least five caravans are believed to have left last night			0
the eviction is due to start on monday and follows a decade - long row over illegal plots			0
prepared : a large police operation is planned for the eviction on monday to ensure it passes off peacefully moving on : reports have emerged that several @entity14 families have already started to leave the site although half of the site is legal , an estimated 400 people are said to be living on 51 unauthorised plots			2
travellers and supporters say they will resist the eviction peacefully but police are preparing a major operation to ensure the @entity16 - led operation passes off peacefully			2
council leader @entity123 said : ' for 10 years we have sought a peaceful and humanitarian solution to @entity14 , but it must be one that involves upholding the law of our country			1
' the current site has been illegally developed			0
after 10 years , when we have exhausted the judicial process and every effort to negotiate , we have no option but to resort to direct action to clear the site			0
' the travellers can find a culturally appropriate answer to their housing problem but it must involve a site with the proper planning permission			2
' the @entity2 " representative " may not be aware that @entity16 provides more approved traveller sites than any other local authority area in @entity15 and among the greatest number on any area in the country			1
we have a very strong record of working with travellers within the law			1
' the @entity2 refers to the rights of the families involved			1
@entity16 respects those along with the rights of the vast majority of its residents who want this illegal camp moved after 10 years of stalling tactics by the travellers			1
' battle : police will start to remove families from the @entity14 site in @entity15 on monday protest : a traveller family demonstrates against the eviction during prof @entity69 ' visit to @entity14 a spokesman for the @entity168 said : ' the @entity57 courts have found that the developments at @entity14 are in breach of planning law and @entity16 is within its rights to evict travellers from the site			1
' it has taken 10 years of failed negotiations and legal process to reach this point , and the unprecedented level of unauthorised development on green belt land has severely damaged community relations			0
' prof @entity12 ' accusation comes on the day when it was revealed that a @entity14 traveller controls a large development in @entity51			1
planning records show that @entity189 , the son of a traveller worth £ 24million , is the mastermind behind a multi-million - pound development in the town of @entity193 , the spiritual home of travellers in the west of @entity51			2
the large detached and semi-detached houses - worth up to £ 400,000 - are close to completion and are near to the local equivalent of millionaires ' row , where other substantial gated properties can be found			0
defiant : travellers living at the @entity14 site in @entity15 have vowed to remain there mr @entity189 is thought to have sold some of the properties to other travellers			2
it is unclear whether @entity14 residents are among the buyers but one local report yesterday claimed that a dozen of the families facing eviction have bought homes in @entity193			0
members of @entity16 , which is responsible for clearing the @entity14 site , are calling for an urgent investigation			0
this latest twist in the saga blows apart the travellers ’ claims that there is nowhere ‘ culturally sensitive ’ for them to go if they are evicted			2
their links with @entity193 – where around half of the town ’s properties are owned by travellers – suggest they have a perfect retreat in their native land			2
evictions : the 10 - year battle to remain at @entity14 was lost earlier this month it also emerged yesterday that @entity16 had paid housing benefits for some of the @entity14 travellers directly to a landlord based in @entity193			2
@entity242 , 55 , bought the former scrapyard at @entity14 for £ 120,000 ten years ago and owns about five caravan pitches on the site			0
the council admitted it paid money directly to mr @entity242 at an address in @entity193 to cover the rent of his tenants , who were allowed to claim housing benefits , despite living on an illegal site			2
many of the homes in @entity193 remain boarded up apart from a few months a year and at @entity255 when a cavalcade of @entity57 - registered @entity257 , @entity258 , @entity259 and porsches roll into the town , pulling caravans behind them			1
extravagant traveller weddings and christenings in the local @entity265 add to the carnival atmosphere over the @entity255 period			0
time to move : the illegal site at @entity14 covers 51 plots and houses around 400 people mr @entity189 , a father of four , runs a business called @entity273 and is the son of @entity193 ’s wealthiest traveller , @entity277 ‘ @entity276 , an antiques dealer			2
@entity278 , a @entity279 councillor in @entity15 , said : ‘ i have long called for an inquiry into the funding of the site			0
‘ this new information needs to be looked at by the council to compare it with any homeless applications and housing benefits claims			0
‘ i do not want to prejudice any investigation , but if any of the same people are involved , it would have huge implications			0
’ @entity14 , built on green belt land near @entity293 , came to the attention of planners around ten years ago when illegal plots started springing up around a smaller approved site			0
under construction : the multi-million pound development of large detached homes in @entity193 in the west of @entity51 since then it has grown into a 400 - strong community of travellers who have built roads and connections to electricity			0
bailiffs and police are planning to start removing travellers on the illegal camp from monday after the council won a @entity314 battle to evict them			1
the travellers and supporters revealed today they have collected a 7,000 - strong petition supporting calls to halt the eviction until suitable alternatives are explored in full			0
they also presented a letter from sir @entity322 , a former @entity2 official , expressing concerns that the clearance may contravene the @entity325			1
campaigner @entity326 said : ' it is not to late for us to stop this			0
we have three planning applications lodged and will be returning to the @entity314 tomorrow to try to stop the eviction			0

@entity2 adviser @entity12 says the @entity57 is breaking travellers ' human rights three times over
argues that ' the people who are abusing the law are the council , not the travellers '
