a new injection has been invented , which its makers claim dissolves fat cells and allows us to pass them out of our bodies when we urinate			1
the new treatment , dubbed @entity8 , claims to be an effective alternative to liposuction - and @entity11 , 39 , from @entity12 , was one of the first women to try it			1
@entity11 paid £ 1000 to have fat zapping treatment on her face and midriff , before getting married to @entity19 , 32 , last year			1
@entity8 , claims to be an effective alternative to liposuction and @entity11 , 39 , from @entity12 , was one of the first women to try it - here she is pictured after the treatment , left , and before , right during the treatment , a water solution was injected into stubborn areas - in @entity11 's case her tummy and chin			1
the jab then it works by breaking down the fat			2
the injection contains plant polymers , which bind with the cell walls of the fat tissue before rupturing and releasing the fat to be dissolved			0
the formula liquefies the fat cell which is then eliminated when you urinate over a three - week period			1
@entity11 , a receptionist , paid £ 900 for a series of three injections , each a month apart , at the dr @entity45 clinic in @entity46			1
@entity11 , pictured left after the treatment and right before , paid £ 1000 to have fat zapping treatment on her face and midriff which broke down the fat cells which she then passed out in the loo @entity11 , 39 , after having the @entity8 fat - dissolving jab , which its makers claim is an effective alternative to liposuction @entity11 's stomach before the fat jab treatment she had already lost two stone , taking her from 10st 2lbs to 8st 5lbs , and dropped from a size 14 to a size 10 before her wedding to hubby @entity19 but wanted to look her best in her dress			1
she said : ' i know people might think it was a quick fix but i really wanted to look good and i 'd tried dieting and exercising and it was n't giving me the results i needed			0
@entity11 also had injections under her jaw to get rid of her double chin ' liposuction seemed too drastic and while the injections are a form of surgery , it seems much less invasive			1
after each session i was a bit sore and bruised but that soon passed and i have n't any scars			0
i 've finally got the body i 've always wanted			0
' @entity11 shows off the results off the double chin fat jab during the procedure , the fatty area , which in @entity11 's case was the lower abdomen and chin , is marked with a pen and a canula - a needle with a tube in - is placed under the skin and the @entity8 solution is injected			1
it takes around ten minutes for each area and the patient is left with swelling and soreness for a few days , but should see results after a week or so			0
dr @entity45 , who carried out the treatment on @entity11 , explained : ' @entity8 is a fat removal therapy used as an alternative to liposuction			1
it is not intended for weight loss , but to improve the contour of the body			0
' it is used to reduce stubborn fat deposits in areas such as the chin , stomach , saddle bags , outer and inner thighs , back fat and thoracic folds and injected directly into the subcutaneous fat tissue using very thin , sharp cannulas			0
' the treated fat cells are gradually dissolved and the metabolism in the area is increased			1
it ’s ideal for those patients with stubborn fat that will not respond to diet and exercise			0
' @entity11 said : ' having a slim , toned stomach has given me so much more confidence and i had spent years working in the gym and trying every diet you can think of to achieve what i have now			2
' but experts have warned that , if the jab works as its makers claim , then users risk increased cholesterol and blood sugar levels and run the risk of becoming diabetic			1
dr @entity146 from @entity12 said : ' i ’ve seen a lot of treatments that claim to reduce fat by breaking it down into an acid so the body reabsorbs it then passes it out and it just does n’t happen			2
dr @entity45 , pictured right , who carried out the treatment on @entity11 , explained : ' @entity8 is a fat removal therapy used as an alternative to liposuction			1
it is not intended for weight loss , but to improve the contour of the body ' it ’s so dangerous to reabsorb fatty acids into your blood stream as if it ’s dissolved down into salt it would send your cholesterol levels sky high			2
' if it ’s broken down into sugars then you are sending your glucose levels sky high that can lead to diabetes			0
“ i ca n’t see any independent evidence that backs up the claims of @entity8 which makes me very skeptical of this			2
' the only real way to get rid of stubborn areas of fat is to dissolve it and suck it out with liposuction			0
' @entity182 , nutrition and fitness expert and author of @entity186 , said she would urge people to use diet and exercise instead			0
she said : ' i 'm very skeptical about the claims the manufacturer is making			0
but even if it does destroy fat cells , if people do not change their lifestyles , i expect that the body would produce new fat cells to replace them			1
' @entity196 , like lipo , is not recommended for weight loss goals but rather to contour the body ' also , if it only destroys fat cells in particular areas then excess calories will continue to be stored in fat cells elsewhere on the body and i 'd be worried about the health implications of this - as well as whether people could end up with strange - looking body shapes			1
' it 's always going to be so much better to shed fat and get into shape naturally with a good nutrition and exercise programme			2
that way you 'll get healthier , fitter and stronger , as well as leaner			0
' dr @entity217 , @entity218 of 111 @entity219 , said : ' i do n’t use fat removal injectables in my clinic and certainly have no plans to until there is further research and trials published			2
' it ’s always important that prospective patients thoroughly research treatments before they book , and these injectables are very new to the market with little evidence of their efficacy other than that produced by the manufacturer			0
' while the cost is certainly affordable and attractive , those thinking of having the procedure must look at alternatives available that have proven results and existing patient testimonials			0
' also , prospective patients must undergo a full consultation to determine the right procedure for their concern			0
' before and after : @entity243 , 42 , from @entity244 also had a £ 250 @entity8 injection and slimmed down			2

@entity8 injections liquefy fat which is then eliminated when you urinate
@entity11 , 39 , was one of first people to try it
she paid £ 1000 to have fat - zapping treatment on her face and midriff
clinic claim absorbed fat cells do not return and there 's no *downtime*
*critics* say it could spell danger for cholesterol if fat turns to salt in blood
