by @entity0 published : 10:35 est , 26 august 2013 updated : 14:09 est , 27 august 2013 a tycoon who was charged almost £ 1million for destroying protected woodland has come under fire for bulldozing rural property in order to build himself a holiday home			2
@entity8 , one of @entity10 's richest men , has knocked down a quaint country cottage in rural @entity12 , near @entity13 , and plans to build a three - storey holiday house in its place			1
the 47 year - old businessman faced was charged £ 950,000 in july after turning woodland where @entity18 was quarried into a wasteland to improve his pheasant shoot			0
@entity21 was charged almost £ 1million in july for tearing down woodland near his home			0
his new plans for a holiday house have been met with the outrage of local residents mr day 's plans for the new house , which will accommodate 24 if finished , have been met with local outrage			1
the development is set to include an underground swimming pool , spa , hot tub and gym , and would almost double the population of the tiny village it is to be built in , which is home to just 24 properties now			0
residents of @entity44 in @entity12 claim the plans threaten environment and wildlife , including colonies of bats which roost in local homes			1
the quaint keeper 's cottage that mr day destroyed in order to build his dream holiday home was much more in keeping with the other houses in the area , residents of @entity44 the holiday home would lie just two miles from the tycoon 's permanent home			1
plans include an underground swimming pool , hot tub , spa and gym local residents fear the ostentatious house wo n't fit in in the rural hamlet which is home to just 24 properties there are concerns over noise and increased traffic along narrow country lanes , as well as fears that the ostentatious property will stand out in the village which is filled with 200 year - olds converted barns and farms			1
but residents of the picture postcard community in rural @entity12 , seven miles from @entity13 - so remote it does not have street lights - are fighting the project			1
@entity85 and @entity86 , who live next to the proposed development , told the council : ' the original building that was demolished was a pretty two - bedroom stone - built cottage which blended in with the surroundings			2
' it is now to be replaced with this new monstrous development which will dwarf the village and will be totally out of character			0
last month mr @entity8 was charged £ 950,000 for destroying protected woodland which he ruined while building a better route to his pheasant shoot a view of how the @entity18 woodland looked before @entity102 chopped down trees and carved out a track near @entity105 in @entity12 , @entity106 ' @entity44 is a quiet , peaceful hamlet and we do not understand how the planning department could think of ruining this by allowing an industrial scale development to be created			1
' businessman @entity111 , who lives at @entity112 , said : ' the structure is just grotesque , ugly and not in keeping with the nearby properties not conducive to the surroundings of what is definitely a picturesque quintessentially @entity106 hamlet			0
' in july , mr @entity8 was fined £ 400,000 with £ 450,000 costs when contractors tried to drive a road through the site , allegedly to give shooting parties better access			2
last week mr day ’s lawyers failed to get the costs reduced when judge @entity126 - who said during the trial that the entrepreneur with a personal fortune of £ 300m had tried ' to use the power of his wealth to avoid responsibility ' - said the public would regard it as ' an affront to justice '			0
mr @entity8 was granted permission to knock down the cottage and replace it with eight separate holiday lets almost two years ago			1
he is now applying to amend his original plans with the new building , which some objectors described as a ‘ boutique hotel ’ and a ‘ fortress ’			2
the plans will be discussed by the council ’s @entity146 on friday ( aug 30 )			0
despite objections from 15 households , planners are recommending it be approved .			0
