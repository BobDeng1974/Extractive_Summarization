archaeologists have uncovered grim evidence of a centuries - old mass grave next to @entity3			2
experts from @entity5 carrying out digs on the city ’s @entity7 have discovered the remains of many more human bodies			1
digs earlier this month found four bodies - a figure which has now risen to 18			1
newly discovered human remains at the @entity3 site brings the total of skeletons found to 18 individuals			1
at first archaeologists believed the remains were overflow from the cathedral 's cemetery , but the way the bodies were arranged reveals an unusual form of burial the team members first thought they had uncovered remains of @entity3 ’s medieval cemetery , the boundaries of which may have extended further than the present day burial site			1
but the newly - discovered corpses had been tipped into the earth without elaborate ceremony , suggesting they part of a mass burial			1
@entity38 , senior archaeologist with @entity39 , said : ' we have found clear evidence of a mass burial and not a normal group of graves			1
' one of the densest areas of the excavation was further north , which is further away from the edge of the presumed graveyard			2
@entity5 will carry out further research into the remains , which will include dating the bones and looking for clues as to their origin			0
this work is expected to begin in the @entity58 ( archaeologist @entity57 , pictured ) @entity38 , senior archaeologist with @entity39 , said : ' the bodies have been tipped into the earth without elaborate ceremony and they are tightly packed together and jumbled ' ' the bodies have been tipped into the earth without elaborate ceremony and they are tightly packed together and jumbled			1
archaeologists working on the dig ( pictured ) said that no definitive interpretation of the grave could be offered at this stage ' some are buried in a @entity70 - to - @entity71 alignment , rather than the traditional @entity73 - to - @entity74 alignment that we would expect from a conventional medieval burial site			1
' the same @entity5 team will carry out further research into the remains , which will include dating the bones and looking for clues as to their origin			0
this work is expected to begin in the @entity58			0
mr @entity38 added that no definitive interpretation could be offered at this stage in the investigation			0
he said : ' the process of post-excavation processing , examination and analysis is essential to allow us to draw proper conclusions about this group of human remains			0
' it is too early to say what they may be			0
' the first evidence of human remains was found earlier in november during building work at the @entity5 ’s @entity100			2
with the necessary permission from the @entity104 ’s @entity103 , archaeologists are carrying out excavation works in the area before taking the bones away for further examination			0
by law , the bones must eventually be reinterred at an approved burial ground			0
@entity112 is undergoing a £ 10m development to establish world - class exhibition and visitor facilities , part of a £ 30m total investment in @entity5 library services .			2
