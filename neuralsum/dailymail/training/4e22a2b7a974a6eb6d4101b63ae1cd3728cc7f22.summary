a professor of neuroeconomics at a university in @entity3 has discovered that dogs have emotion , just like humans			1
@entity7 , a professor of neuroeconomics at @entity9 , @entity10 , who has been testing the results of mri scans on his dog ’s brain , has discovered that our canine friends use the same part of the brain as humans to ‘ feel ’			1
his initial goal was to determine how dogs ’ brains work and what they think of humans , according to the @entity25			2
dog feelings : canines have emotions just like humans , shows new research @entity32 's life : yes , they like to slobber			2
but it does n't mean they do n't have feelings months of research : @entity7 , a professor at neuroeconomics at @entity9 , @entity10 , has discovered that dogs have emotion by looking directly at their brains and bypassing the constraints of behaviourism , @entity41 can tell humans about dogs ’ internal states			1
people usually do not enjoy mri scans and you have to hold completely still during the procedure			1
in conventional veterinary practice , animals are put under anaesthetic so they do n’t move during a scan			0
' but that means they ca n’t study their brain functions , at least , not anything interesting like perception or emotion , ' says @entity7			2
he started training his own dog , @entity63 , a skinny black terrier mix from the @entity65 , to go into the @entity41 simulator he had built in his living room			0
with the help of his friend , @entity70 , a dog trainer , the dog learned to place her head in a custom - fitted chin rest and hold rock - still for up to 30 seconds			0
mri scans : the dogs had their brain functions scanned by mri machines their study , published in the @entity80 , involved training a dozen dogs to remain motionless , while unsedated and unrestrained , in an mri machine months of training : @entity70 , a dog trainer , helped @entity7 to teach the dogs how to lie completely still in the mri machine for up to 30 seconds maps of brain activity : the scans at first determined which parts of the dogs ' brain distinguished the scents of familiar and unfamiliar dogs and humans after months of training and some trial - and - error at the real mri scanner , they were rewarded with the first maps of brain activity and managed to determine which parts of her brain distinguished the scents of familiar and unfamiliar dogs and humans			1
he found there was a striking similarity between dogs and humans in both the structure and function of a key brain region : the caudate nucleus			1
the caudate sits between the brainstem and the cortex and is rich in dopamine receptors			0
in humans , the caudate plays a key role in the anticipation of things we enjoy , like food , love and money , according to @entity7			1
in dogs , the research found that activity in the caudate increased in response to hand signals indicating food			2
the caudate also activated to the smells of familiar humans			0
and in preliminary tests , it activated to the return of an owner who had momentarily stepped out of view			0
' do these findings prove that dogs love us ? not quite			0
but many of the same things that activate the human caudate , which are associated with positive emotions , also activate the dog caudate , ' said @entity7			1
neuroscientists call this a functional homology , and it may be an indication of canine emotions			0
the ability to experience positive emotions , like love and attachment , would mean that dogs have a level of sentience comparable to that of a human child			1
same part of the brain : @entity160 found that activity in the dog 's caudate increased in response to the return of an owner who had momentarily stepped out of view same same : the things that activate the human caudate , which are associated with positive emotions , also activate the dog caudate			2
@entity7 says it should be a step towards changing the way we treat dogs @entity7 believes this begs a change in the way humans think about dogs , which have long been considered property			1
though the @entity182 raised the bar for the treatment of animals , they solidified the view that animals are things — objects that can be disposed of as long as reasonable care is taken to minimise their suffering			0
he suggest the idea that , since the @entity199 has already included neuroscientific findings in some cases showing brain imaging to determine whether someone is mature in adolescence , then ‘ perhaps someday we may see a case arguing for a dog ’s rights based on brain - imaging findings ’ .			0

@entity7 , a professor of neuroeconomics at @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity3 , says dogs use the same area of the brain as humans do to feel
@entity7 ' research is the result of months of mri scans on dogs who are not sedated but trained to sit *perfectly* still in the machine
the results show that dogs use the caudate nucleus part of the brain when *responding* to humans they know
it is the same part of the brain humans use in the anticipation of things we enjoy , like food , love and money
@entity7 says this shows that dogs have a level of sentience comparable to that of a human child
he says this should change the way we perceive dogs and how we treat them
