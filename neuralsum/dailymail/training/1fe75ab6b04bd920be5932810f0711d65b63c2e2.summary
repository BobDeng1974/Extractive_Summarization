@entity0 are in action for the first time since their humiliating 7 - 1 @entity4 semi-final defeat and subsequent 3 - 0 thrashing by @entity6 in the third - place playoff			1
their friendly against @entity8 in @entity9 is the first match since those results exposed the reality of their poor team and dealt crushing blows to the @entity4 hosts which knocked the national team to the ground			1
new manager @entity19 , who replaced @entity20 , has been tasked with hauling them back to their feet and turning them into the heavyweight world champions they once were			1
the biggest casualties were @entity56 right - back @entity55 and @entity58 full - back @entity39			1
both are known for their marauding style on the flanks which has been horribly exposed in the past , something @entity19 is no longer prepared to stand for			2
@entity64 's @entity63 and former first - choice goalkeeper @entity65 are also two major names to have been left out			0
lifted : @entity19 ( right ) lifts the 1994 @entity4 trophy aloft after captaining @entity0 to glory 10 years ago in charge : @entity19 took a hatchet to @entity0 's @entity4 squad and only 10 of the 23 - man group made the cut the chop : the biggest casualties were @entity56 right - back @entity55 and @entity58 full - back @entity39 the new crop three players will have the chance to prove themselves on their international debuts ; @entity81 's attacking midfielders @entity82 and @entity83 and @entity86 centre - back @entity84			1
of the three , @entity83 is the most exciting addition			0
he is currently joint - top scorer in the @entity89 top - flight with nine goals , playing in the no 10 role for @entity81			2
in july he scored a wonder goal from his own half in a friendly against @entity95			0
he is relishing his call - up , saying this week : ' forget the @entity4			2
now we are a different group and have a new coach			0
' another to be handed a chance many felt he was unfairly denied by @entity20 is @entity101			0
the @entity103 forward was frozen out by @entity20 , but has finally got a real opportunity to prove his place in the national side			0
happy about that , @entity101 ? @entity101 can prove his worth for @entity0 against @entity8 after being called up responsibility for the @entity109 @entity32 made a return to action at the weekend after a fractured back ended his @entity4 dreams , coming off the bench in @entity56 's win against @entity116			1
the poster boy of the @entity0 @entity4 has been handed the captaincy , and if his performances in that tournament , when he dragged an average side through to the semi-final before his injury , is anything to go by he will lead by example			2
it is likely that this friendly will pit him against defender @entity128 , who was responsible for the flailing knee which struck @entity32 's back and put him out of the tournament			1
@entity19 , himself a @entity4 - winning @entity0 captain , is confident he has made the right decision			1
' @entity32 has responded very well to it , ' he said			0
' he is a player who likes challenges and like to win			0
we talked to him when we first broached the subject and we told him what we wanted			0
he 's a player with a lot of quality , despite his age is experienced			0
the captain has to set the standard for the others			0
' guess who 's back : @entity32 returned to action at the weekend after a fractured back ended his @entity4 recovered : @entity32 came off the bench in @entity56 's win against @entity116 as the poster boy returns @entity152 another player who survived @entity19 's savage cuts is @entity155 – and the world 's most expensive defender will also be expected to shoulder more responsibility			1
a friendly against @entity8 is no better way to test the often inconsistent centre - back			1
trying to deal with @entity163 's new striker @entity162 and @entity58 's £ 71million signing @entity164 could turn brutal			2
@entity162 is back from the knee injury which ruled him out of the @entity4			2
the last time he faced @entity155 he tore him to shreds , scoring a hat - trick in @entity169 's 4 - 1 @entity168 win back in 2012			1
@entity164 is also no longer ' @entity164 ' – the new kid – the nickname he was initially given by @entity8 fans in tribute to legend @entity175 who was called ' @entity176			0
' the pair are a frightening prospect			0
@entity0 scraped through against @entity8 when they met in the quarter - finals during the summer , but this could be very different			2
pressure : another player who survived @entity19 's savage cuts is @entity155 , who must shoulder responsibility a big challenge : a friendly against @entity8 is no better way to test the often inconsistent centre - back @entity190 discusses his @entity0 squad no room for sentiment despite wholesale changes there are still no recalls for @entity198 or @entity199 , and @entity200 was also omitted from the squad until @entity202 got injured and he was brought in as a replacement			1
they were the big names who @entity20 largely ignored and it appears that @entity19 has no interest in changing that decision			0
the attitude of @entity198 , now 34 , was questioned by the last regime while @entity199 's career has been on a downward spiral since the 32 - year - old left @entity213 in 2009			1
but @entity200 , another with so much promise so young , now 30 , has a glimmer of hope			0
no comeback : @entity198 , now 34 years old , has not been recalled to the @entity0 squad for the friendly no @entity199 : they were the big names who @entity20 largely ignored and @entity19 has no interest in changing that			1

@entity0 's @entity4 squad diminished by less than half as just 10 of the 23 - man group made the cut under manager @entity19
@entity56 right - back @entity55 and @entity58 full - back @entity39 among those who did not make the cut for the friendly against @entity8
@entity81 's attacking midfielders @entity82 and @entity83 and @entity86 centre - back @entity84 are the three new players *introduced*
injured @entity32 and @entity155 return to shoulder responsibility for @entity0
@entity198 and @entity199 do *n't* make the cut but @entity200 replaces injured hulk
