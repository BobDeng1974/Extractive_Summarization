' i think both @entity1 father and son are very conscious of not detracting the limelight that should be cast on our incumbent president			2
' the opening of the museum comes after years of fighting between groups over how 9/11 should be portrayed for history , and whether the terror attackers ' @entity300 faith should play a prominent part in exhibits former president @entity304 was visibly moved by the ceremony ; his administration preceded the 9/11 attacks , but the first bombing of the @entity55 in 1993 came on his watch cards , patches and other mementos of those killed at @entity134 -- many left at the site 's makeshift memorials in the months following the terrorist massacre -- are now on display at the @entity194 september 11 @entity193 never forget : a tribute to the firefighters killed on 9/11 is posted on the ' @entity320 ' displayed at the museum fragments of the fuselage of @entity324 , a @entity325 767 aircraft that hit the @entity327 's @entity326 , are displayed at the @entity194 september 11 @entity193 ; the impact killed all 92 people on board , along with an unknown number on the building 's upper floors			2
