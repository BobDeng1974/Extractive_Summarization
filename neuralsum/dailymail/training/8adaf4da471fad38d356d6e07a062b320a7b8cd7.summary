against all odds : @entity1 was hospitalized for months after the hit and run that almost took his life a @entity6 teenager left dead after a horrifying hit and run made a miraculous recovery – and his family says fish oil saved his life			1
@entity12 ’s long road to recovery began in september 2012 after he was run over by a car			1
he was clinically dead until paramedics revived him – but he suffered severe brain damage			1
the now - 17 - year - old also suffered a torn aorta , skull fractures and bleeding on the brain , and bone and spine fractures , the @entity12 family told @entity23			1
doctors said he would likely not survive through the night			0
‘ it 's like , how dare you not fight for my son 's life ? ’ mother @entity30 recalled			2
‘ it really took us ... getting very aggressive and assertive to save our son 's life , because they were n't going to do it			1
‘ they told us not to			0
they told us to let him go , ’ she continued			0
but the family , from @entity40 , refused to accept that @entity1 would not live to see another day			2
police soon closed their investigation into the case having never found the person who hit the teen , according to the @entity46 , but his family fought on to save his life			2
she ever gae up : doctors told mother @entity50 to let her son die , but she refused awake , but not himself : @entity1 eventually woke from his coma , but brain damage was so severe he barely resembled his former self a long road back : the @entity12 family began administering high doses of fish oil to @entity1 soon after he woke up @entity50 , a renowned fitness expert , decided to try any and everything she thought would help her son			1
the teen underwent several surgeries to stabilize his condition , but his brain function did not dramatically improve – until a friend suggested they try fish oil and progesterone			1
progesterone has been shown in studies to reduce swelling on the brain – though not when rubbed topically as the @entity12 ’s did			2
the suggestions came after a mine disaster survivor was left brain dead but came back to almost complete normalcy after large doses of fish oil			1
remarkable results : within two days , @entity1 ( pictured with father @entity81 ) was making phone calls home even more amazing : @entity1 was soon on his way home and walking again he 's out ! : @entity1 being wheeled from the hospital by his siblings @entity1 soon woke up and began speaking – but only with a limited vocabulary , his family recalled			1
‘ @entity91 , ’ he would say , ‘ i love you , ’ he often repeated			0
improvement was slow at first , but it was noticeable			0
‘ when your kid is in a coma , and then coming out of a coma , you watch every nuance , ’ @entity50 told @entity23			2
‘ if his eyelash fluttered , ' oh , his eyelash fluttered ! ‘ you 're holding on to anything that you can see and monitoring everything , every single day			0
and so it was very clear when the acceleration happened			0
’ slowly returning to himself : @entity1 was soon starting to resemble himself again , even playing drums proud papa : father @entity108 is relieved the fish oil therapy worked and that he has his son again still a work in progress : @entity12 still works daily with a speech therapist the @entity12 family started administering high doses of the natural remedy to @entity1 to see if it would speed his recovery since the brain ’s cell wall is made of omega - 3 fatty acids			1
‘ if you have a brick wall and it gets damaged , would n't you want to use bricks to repair it ? ’ dr. @entity126 lewistold @entity23			0
‘ by supplementing using ( omega - 3 fatty acids ) in substantial doses , you provide the foundation for the brain to repair itself			2
’ fish oil did not work , though , in every instance it was tried , @entity23 notes , but the @entity12 ’s went ahead with the unorthodox therapy at a dosage of 20 - grams - per - day			1
the largest known dosage ever given to anyone			0
‘ if someone said to me , you know what , you can give him fish oil , you can give him better nutrition , you 'll get maybe 5 % ( improvement ) , i 'll take that , ’ the mother said			1
@entity50 got a late night phone call only two days after @entity1 started taking the fish oil			1
he 's getting there : the teen 's life is slowly returning to normal , he even plans to return to high school for his senior year giving back : pirctured with mother @entity50 , @entity1 brought presents to ailing children being treated at the hospital where he almost died last year ' a miracle ' : workers at the hospital @entity1 healed in called him a miracle during his recent visit ‘ i get this call like midnight , and i 'm asleep , and i wake up the next morning and go , ' did @entity1 call me and did we have this whole conversation ? ’ she recalled			1
‘ i just remember waking up the next morning going , ' i must have dreamed that , that could n't have possibly happened			0
’ she drove to the hospital that morning in shock , two months after doctors told her to ‘ let him go , ’ @entity1 was talking			2
‘ we had been told he 'd never be able to recognize anybody , he will never be able to focus his eyes , all the grim stuff , ’ father @entity108 told @entity23			0
‘ [ they said ] the diffuse damage to his brain is so much that he 's never going to be @entity1 again , ’ he continued			1
the teen has n’t made a full recovery , he may never , but he has recovered to a point far greater than anyone thought possible			2
physically healed : the 17 - year - old is fully healed physically , he has resumed weight lifting and other activities realization : despite all the progress he 's made , @entity1 knows he still has a lot of work to come fully back a recent visit to the hospital he spent more than two months in showed him greeted by a nurse calling him a ‘ miracle			1
’ he returned with presents for 20 children and gave them out while smiling , laughing and joking with the younger patients			0
‘ from when he first arrived compared to now is just night and day , ’ occupational therapist @entity194 , who works at the hospital , told the @entity46			0
‘ when he left us he was able to walk and talk , but he was still very impaired			0
‘ this is why we work in this area , ’ she continued			0
‘ to have him come back and see this kind of success story is just amazing			0

@entity1 was clinically dead after being run over by a car until paramedics revived him
he lay in a coma for weeks after a series of surgeries to save his life
he eventually woke up , but had suffered severe brain damage to the point he could barely function
highly concentrated doses of fish oil had him calling home after only two days of the *unusual* therapy
