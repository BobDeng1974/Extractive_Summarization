a person familiar with the decision said that @entity20 's group will buy 65 per cent of the franchise , which is valued at a total price of $ 525 million , and move the team to @entity9 and restore the @entity2 name			1
the deal will cost the @entity20 group a little more than $ 340 million			1
the @entity51 will have no stake in the team			0
the person spoke to @entity1 on condition of anonymity because the deal was waiting approval			0
the sale figure works off a total valuation of the franchise , which includes relocation fees			0
@entity20 's group also is hoping to buy out other minority investors			1
the @entity51 will get a $ 30 million non-refundable down payment by february 1 , according to the deal , the person said			1
they will still be allowed to receive other offers until the league approves the sale			0
the @entity10 sale price of $ 525 would surpass the @entity16 record $ 450 million the @entity70 sold for in 2010			1
the plan by @entity20 's group is to have the team play at least the next two seasons in @entity74 before moving into a new facility in downtown @entity9			1
down payment : the @entity51 will get a $ 30 million non-refundable down payment by february 1 , according to the deal , the person said ( @entity37 pictured ) high price : the @entity10 sale price of $ 525 would surpass the @entity16 record $ 450 million the @entity70 sold for in 2010 the deadline for teams to apply for a move for next season is march 1			1
the office of @entity9 mayor @entity86 confirmed monday it is already working with @entity20 on an agreement for using @entity74 , including scheduling and short - term upgrades to the arena			1
‘ while we are not at liberty to discuss the terms of the transaction or our plans for the franchise given the confidential nature of the agreement and @entity16 regulations regarding public comments during a pending transaction , we would just like to extend our sincerest compliments and gratitude toward the @entity37 , ’ @entity20 said in a statement			1
‘ our negotiations with the family were handled with the utmost honor and professionalism and we hope to continue their legacy and be great stewards of this @entity16 franchise in the coming years and decades			1
’ @entity20 was not available for further comment			0
@entity113 was building toward a sale agreement after word of talks between @entity20 and the @entity51 leaked nearly two weeks ago			0
@entity10 will get its chance to counter with mayor @entity118 already receiving permission from @entity16 commissioner @entity120 to present a counteroffer to league owners from buyers who would keep the @entity10 in @entity10			1
@entity118 , himself a former all - star point guard in the @entity16 , said in a statement that the city remained undeterred			0
‘ @entity10 has proven that it is a strong @entity16 market with a fan base that year in and year out has demonstrated a commitment to the @entity10 by selling out 19 of 27 seasons in a top 20 market and owning two of the longest sellout streaks in @entity16 history , ’ @entity118 said			2
yet @entity118 will be fighting an uphill challenge trying to pull together an ownership group in a small window of time while @entity9 begins preparing for the return of the green and gold			2
piece of history : the @entity2 became a historic footnote when owner @entity145 moved the franchise to @entity147 in 2008 the @entity2 became a historic footnote when owner @entity145 moved the franchise to @entity147 in 2008			2
it was the conclusion of a contentious two years of lawsuits , broken leases , negotiations and ultimately a settlement that allowed 41 years of pro basketball history in @entity9 to be moved away			0
while @entity9 was excited about monday 's news , there was an air of caution as well , with many fans still stung about the @entity162 previous departure not wanting to believe in their return until everything is signed and delivered			2
others in @entity9 have wanted an expansion franchise rather than taking a team from another city			2
‘ it tore the hearts out of the city when the ( team ) left the first time and it 's just wonderful news to get a team back , ’ said @entity169 , who was at @entity74 monday buying college basketball tickets			2
‘ i feel sorry for the people of @entity10 , they have good fans there , but we want our team back			2
’ ironically enough , it will be @entity145 that has a say in whether @entity9 returns to the @entity16 portfolio as the head of the league 's relocation committee			1
moving on : the @entity51 backed out of a tentative $ 391 million deal for a new downtown venue with @entity10 last year ( tv personality @entity192 pictured ) caught in an awkward spot is the @entity10 ' basketball team itself , some of whom have @entity9 ties			1
guard @entity198 grew up in @entity199 , @entity200 , and before the @entity10 played in @entity201 on monday was already feeling the discomfort of being wedged between two cities			0
‘ it 's just a little weird ( but ) at the same time i love @entity10 , i love everything about it			0
love the fans , the organization just brought me in with open arms			0
that 's all i really know in this league is @entity10 , ’ @entity198 said			2
‘ but then i am from that area back home , it 's just kind of a different situation			0
whatever i say about @entity9 , @entity10 fans might be mad at me and whatever i say about @entity10 , @entity9 fans might be mad at me			2
i just love both cities			0
‘ it 's out of my control , ’ he said			0
the saga of the @entity10 ' future in @entity225 's @entity224 city has dragged on for nearly three years and now faces its most daunting challenge			0
@entity20 , a @entity9 native and @entity228 - based investor , reached agreement with local governments in @entity9 last october on plans to build a $ 490 million @entity16 / @entity233 arena near the city 's other stadiums , @entity236 and @entity237			1
no construction will begin until all environmental reviews are completed and a team has been secured			0
the arena also faces a pair of lawsuits , including one from a long - shore workers union because the arena is being built close to port and industrial operations			0
fans : @entity250 's fans head to the @entity251 at the @entity16 's @entity10 home at @entity253 ( formally @entity253 ) in @entity10 , @entity225 @entity20 's group is expected to pitch in $ 290 million in private investment toward the arena , along with helping to pay for transportation improvements in the area around the stadiums			1
the remaining $ 200 million in public financing would be paid back with rent money and admissions taxes from the arena , and if that money falls short , @entity20 would be responsible for making up the rest			2
other investors in the proposed arena include @entity269 chief executive @entity268 and two members of the @entity272 department store family			0
‘ while there is more work ahead , this is a major step toward bringing the @entity162 home , ’ @entity274 fans hope this is not the final chapter in their quest to save the @entity10			0
@entity118 has once already saved the @entity10 from relocation when he made a pitch to the board of governors and bought the city time to broker a deal that appeared to solve the team 's arena woes			1
but the @entity51 backed out of that tentative $ 391 million deal for a new downtown venue with @entity10 last year			1
@entity118 said recently he 's heard from various parties interested in trying to put together an ownership group that would keep the team in @entity10 , but only with a new arena			1
‘ we have always appreciated and treasured our ownership of the @entity10 and have had a great admiration for the fans and our team members			0
we would also like to thank @entity20 for his professionalism during our negotiation			0
@entity20 will be a great steward for the franchise , ’ @entity10 co-owner @entity37 said in a statement on behalf of the family			1
admiration : ' we have always appreciated and treasured our ownership of the @entity10 and have had a great admiration for the fans and our team members ' @entity37 said in a statement on behalf of the family			2
