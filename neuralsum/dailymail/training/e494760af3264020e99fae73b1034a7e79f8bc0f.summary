by @entity1 medical correspondent getting some sun on your skin not only improves your mood but could also reduce your blood pressure , say experts			1
a study found a strong link between low levels of vitamin d , absorbed by the body from sunlight , and higher levels of blood pressure			1
researchers believe it is the first study of its kind to suggest that taking vitamin d supplements could be an alternative to drugs for tacking high blood pressure in some patients			1
around 30 per cent of people in @entity26 have high blood pressure , known as hypertension , which is the single most important risk factor for early death			1
antihypertensive drugs have common side effects such as coughing , dizziness , facial flushing and constipation , experts believe some people might benefit from vitamin d supplements instead lead researcher professor @entity39 from the @entity40 said ‘ in view of the costs and side effects associated with anti-hypertensive drugs , the potential to prevent or reduce blood pressure and therefore the risk of hypertension with vitamin d is very attractive			1
’ previously , a @entity50 study of more than one million patients found people with cancer diagnosed in summer and autumn lived longer than those diagnosed at other times of the year , probably because their vitamin d levels are topped up by sun exposure			2
the new findings come as debates rages over whether vitamin d plays a role in helping prevent disease , with conflicting scientific views			0
although the vitamin is found in salmon , tuna and other oily fish , and is routinely added to milk , diet accounts for very little of the nutrient that actually makes it into the bloodstream compared with sun exposure			0
in a new study published in @entity75 journal researchers used genetic data from a database of 146,500 people across @entity79 and @entity80			0
they looked at particular genetic variants in the blood which affect levels of vitamin d circulating in the blood to establish the relationship with hypertension			2
the study found each ten per cent increase in vitamin d in the system was linked to lower blood pressure and an 8.1 per cent lower chance of suffering from hypertension			1
because antihypertensive drugs have common side effects such as coughing , dizziness , facial flushing and constipation , experts believe some people might benefit from vitamin d supplements instead			1
although the vitamin is found in salmon , tuna and other oily fish , and is routinely added to milk , diet accounts for very little of the nutrient that actually makes it into the bloodstream compared with sun exposure figures show three quarters of @entity50 have vitamin d intakes which are below recommended levels , with children and older people are at particular risk			2
in the @entity50 , the @entity119 does not recommend a specific daily dose of vitamin d unless you are elderly , pregnant , @entity123 , get little sun exposure and eat no meat or oily fish when 10mcg is advised			0
it says daily supplements of 25mcg are unlikely to cause harm			0
the danger with taking excessive doses for long periods is that the body absorbs too much calcium , which could weaken bones and possibly damage liver and kidneys			0
earlier this year a major review found cancer patients with more vitamin d in their blood tended to have better survival rates and were in remission longer than those who were deficient			0
the findings came from analysis of 25 separate studies looking at vitamin d and cancer death rates .			0
