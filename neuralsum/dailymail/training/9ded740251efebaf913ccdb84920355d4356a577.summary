the murder trial into the killing of a @entity4 tycoon once dubbed princess @entity7 's ' toyboy ' is rapidly descending into farce after key evidence has gone missing , and witnesses have refused to testify because of ' threats ' , it emerged today			1
furniture magnate @entity12 , 46 , was shot dead driving his mercedes near @entity15 in 2012 , but the truth behind his death appears no closer to being revealed			1
there are even claims that the suspected killer has ' escaped '			1
' @entity20 ' : @entity12 ( pictured right ) with princess @entity22 ( left ) together in @entity15 in 2006 gunned down : @entity12 , pictured here in april 2006 outside his @entity15 furniture factory , was shot dead driving his mercedes near @entity15 in 2012 the suave businessman caused a royal scandal six years earlier when he was photographed walking hand in hand with the princess - who will be 70 next month - in @entity31 during a four day holiday during which they allegedly enjoyed a gondola trip and shared a suite in @entity31 's @entity37			1
police arrested three suspects - including a former business partner of @entity12 who had alleged gangland ties - in the aftermath of the killing			1
but now - following a dozen court sessions - a major @entity46 - friendly newspaper , @entity47 , has concluded bluntly : ' we should not expect a fair trial			0
' there are even fears the case could be aborted			0
a source in the @entity53 , equivalent of the @entity55 , said : ' witnesses are receiving letters with threats			0
they are hiding and do not want to speak in court			0
' one was approached in the street and told not to testify or ' things will get much worse '			0
state investigators ' have lost important physical evidence on the case ' , according to court sources , including an unspecified item ' even more important for establishing guilt than the actual weapon '			1
the newspaper stated : ' it became known that the evidence was missing about three weeks ago			2
but so far it does not affect the trial because the judge has not started studying the evidence yet			0
' on trial : @entity79 ( left ) , @entity76 ( center ) and @entity78 ( right ) are alleged to have been behind the hit			0
but the actual killer , named as @entity82 , is said to have escaped after the crime framed ? @entity76 , a former security aide to @entity12 is an alleged member of the ' elephants ' mafia ring			1
@entity12 's friends have expressed doubts that he ordered the shooting , suggesting he was set up the trial is going ahead regardless despite the absence of the suspected killer			1
named as @entity82 , he ' managed to escape from police and investigators after the crime ' , according to @entity96 news agency			1
on trial are @entity76 , a former security aide to @entity12 who is an alleged member of the ' elephants ' mafia ring , and two associates @entity79 and @entity101 , who both work for a small @entity15 security agency			0
royal scandal : @entity12 was photographed walking hand - in - hand with the princess			1
she said they were just good friends and that she was a ' tactile person , i do it all the time ' people from @entity12 's circle have expressed doubts that @entity76 ordered the shooting , suggesting he was framed			0
@entity76 denies any part in his murder			0
the princess maintained that she and @entity12 were just good friends , famously adding when asked why they were holding hands : ' i 'm a very tactile person , i do it all the time			1
' yet there were also claims that she was ' mesmerised ' by @entity12 , while a loyal aide to the @entity4 tycoon , @entity123 , said : ' @entity12 had charisma of such magnitude that no woman , or indeed man , could stay indifferent to him			2
' @entity123 had no idea whether their relationship became physical			0
' how can you be 100 per cent sure ? ' yet in the aftermath of the @entity31 scandal , the princess , this time with her husband @entity132 , went on a @entity138 boat trip with @entity12			2
after his death , a spokesman said prince @entity22 and his wife were ' very distressed to hear of this tragedy '			2
theories abounded as to why @entity12 was murdered			0
there was even speculation from conspiracy theorists that it could have been a state - instigated assassination to strike at the @entity147 , linked to the close friendship between prince @entity22 and his financial backer , exiled businessman @entity150 , who died in mysterious circumstances in @entity153 less than a year later			1
@entity150 was seen as @entity155 's sworn enemy			0
some people close to @entity12 fear he was killed in a bid by major business interests to grab control of his ' march 8 ' furniture empire			2
' tragedy ' : prince @entity22 and his wife released a statement at the time saying they were ' very distressed ' to hear of @entity12 's death after he was murdered another theory was that the murder could have been a case of mistaken identity			1
the official version is that he was killed over a small - scale property ownership dispute in @entity171 but one source who knew @entity12 well claimed this was ' contrived and implausible '			2
the blunders over the trial show ' someone is trying to muddy the waters and stop the truth getting out ' .			0
