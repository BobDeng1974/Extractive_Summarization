@entity1 war planes were yesterday scrambled to intercept two @entity3 bombers capable of carrying nuclear missiles as they flew south of @entity5			1
@entity7 jets on high alert were dispatched from two @entity10 bases and flew alongside the long - range @entity3 @entity12 aircraft until they were out of the region			1
last night experts said @entity17 ’s move to send planes capable of carrying cruise missiles so close to @entity1 shores could be seen as an act of aggression			1
off you go : a @entity12 is escorted by an @entity10 jet during an alert in september			0
( @entity26 picture ) they said the manoeuvre in the @entity30 could have been designed to ‘ probe the @entity10 speed of reaction ’ – raising fears that the @entity3 were looking for weaknesses in the @entity1 fighter force			1
within seconds of the bombers deviating from their usual flight path , the @entity1 quick reaction alert ( @entity38 ) jets were scrambled			1
a defence source said the @entity10 always ‘ maintains the highest level of readiness ’ , just as in the days of @entity44			0
the @entity45 were dispatched from @entity46 in @entity47 and @entity48 in @entity49			0
they were so close to the @entity3 planes – roughly 1,000ft away – that they could signal to the pilots			2
a qra is launched to intercept aircraft that can not be identified by any other means			0
in this case , the @entity3 would either not have filed a flight plan , not transmitted a recognisable surveillance radar code , or failed to talk to air traffic control			2
@entity62 , of defence think - tank the @entity60 , said : ‘ this case is very unusual			2
normally @entity3 @entity64 come past @entity65 and down the @entity66			2
it could have been used to probe the @entity10 speed of reaction south			0
’ in a reference to the inquiry into the poisoning of former @entity73 spy @entity72 in @entity74 , she said : ‘ flying any military aircraft in or close to the sovereign airspace of another country signals displeasure or at worst aggression			0
’ while the bombers were in international airspace , they were deviating from a standard route			1
closely watched : @entity10 @entity7 jets were scrambled in october to track this @entity3 @entity86 bomber , one of two which flew close to @entity1 without filing flight plans or communicating with air traffic controllers followed : these @entity10 images show the moment the aircraft were escorted by @entity45 near @entity1 airspace a defence ministry spokesman said : ‘ @entity45 were launched after @entity3 aircraft were identified flying close to @entity1 airspace			1
‘ the @entity3 planes were escorted until they were out of the @entity1 area of interest			1
at no time did they cross into @entity1 airspace			1
’ a source added : ‘ why would you want to send @entity3 strategic bombers this far down ? there is the @entity108 crisis and there is the @entity72 trial but i would n’t like to speculate			1
if we knew the aircraft did have cruise missiles on it and was ready to use them , it would n’t last very long			0
’ the two @entity64 were escorted for about half an hour as they passed over the @entity30 and south of @entity5 and @entity116			0
they then returned to their normal route , flying around @entity119 and up past the tip of @entity47			0
during this time it is likely the @entity10 will have been communicating to the @entity3 pilots through their radios			2
in october , @entity45 intercepted another @entity12 over the @entity66 and @entity3 warships passed through the @entity30 and had to be escorted by the @entity125 .			0

@entity7 jets flew alongside the long - range bombers over the channel
experts say @entity3 may have been probing weaknesses in @entity1 defence
bombers were in international airspace , but deviated from a standard route
