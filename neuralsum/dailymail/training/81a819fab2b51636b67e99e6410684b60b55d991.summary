by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 has admitted that @entity4 viewers would sometimes do better to turn off the television and go to bed rather than watch the programme			1
the anchor of @entity10 's flagship news broadcast revealed that on some nights he wanted to say , ' not much happened today ' - but added that he would feel guilty about betraying his colleagues if he did so			1
the presenter 's comments came during a wide - ranging interview in which mr @entity2 suggested that the current ' cosseted ' generation might benefit from @entity17 , and said that he feels guilty about never serving in the @entity18			1
nothing on ? @entity2 admits that sometimes he wants to tell @entity4 viewers to stop watching last year , @entity4 's editor made headlines by tweeting that one of the guests on his own show was ' boring snoring '			1
and mr @entity2 appears to support that view some of the time , telling the @entity28 that on slow news days it is hardly worth watching the programme			1
' news is not easily predicted and a certain amount of time has to be filled , ' the 63 - year - old said			2
' i 'd often like to see the presenter say , " not much happened today , so i 'd go to bed if i were you			2
" ' i 've often felt like that on @entity4			1
i would n't do it , because it 's disloyal to colleagues who have slaved long and hard to make bricks without straw			1
that 's the nature of journalism			2
' however , the veteran broadcaster denied the suggestion that he fails to hide his boredom on camera , saying : ' i ca n't help my face			0
it 's long , and i can do nothing about it			2
' and he dismissed criticism that the programme has dumbed down thanks to recent segments such as a long interview with comedian @entity62 and presenter @entity63 dancing to thriller on @entity64			1
controversy : the presenter 's interview with comedian @entity62 was criticised by some viewers reflecting on the furore cause by his decision to grow a beard last summer , mr @entity2 said he was ‘ naïve ’ not to expect the attention , adding it was ‘ absurd , but funny ’			1
in september last year , @entity4 editor @entity74 caused controversy when he accidentally sent out a @entity77 message describing one guest , @entity80 frontbencher @entity79 , as ' boring snoring '			1
the show boss , who joined after the previous editor was forced to resign over the @entity85 scandal , apologised for the blunder			2
in the @entity28 interview , mr @entity2 revealed his guilt at having such a privileged life while his parents ’ generation had to fight in the @entity92			1
the presenter - whose father @entity94 served in the @entity96 convoys - said conscription and @entity17 taught the importance of duty , whereas modern generations are ‘ cosseted ’ and expected to do nothing but ‘ gratify themselves ’			2
dumbing down ? mr @entity2 denied that segments such as @entity63 's @entity105 dance proved @entity4 's standards were slipping he said : ‘ i ’d have done better for having time in uniform			1
the more we see of other members of our society , we realise we ’re all human beings with the same hopes and fears			0
‘ i ’m not arguing in favour of @entity17 , but i feel in awe of my parents ’ generation who had to do that , and a bit guilty having such a privileged life			2
we ’ve had it pretty easy and never been tested			0
‘ obviously i ’m not wishing war on anyone , but it might have been better for all of us if we ’d been obliged to do something rather than choosing for ourselves			2
' it ’s difficult to comprehend today a society where people were expected to do things other than gratify themselves			0
' reflecting on the @entity131 , he said : ‘ it ’s such an imaginative leap from our cosseted , indulged lives to something other than the achievement of personal pleasure			0
that ’s really why people find it so hard to come to terms with the @entity92			0
’ reintroduced before the @entity92 in 1939 , @entity17 ended in the @entity140 in 1960 , when mr @entity2 was 10			1
' in awe ' : mr @entity2 spoke of his respect for those who were obliged to fight , such as these @entity140 infantrymen at the @entity145 asked about the case of @entity149 sergeant @entity148 , who last december was sentenced to life for killing a wounded @entity152 insurgent in 2011 , the interviewer said those who have not fought for their country should not judge those who have			1
he said : ‘ it ’s not attractive seeing people who have never been in extremis passing judgment on others who have			0
who knows how we ’d behave ? imagine seeing your best friend blown to pieces , unable even to retrieve the body for burial			0
' next week , mr @entity2 ’s new tv series @entity169 will start the @entity10 ’s four - year commemoration of the first world war centenary			1
in recent months , the presenter has been embroiled in a row with education secretary @entity174 , who said hit sitcom blackadder perpetuated a ‘ myth ’ that the @entity92 was a ‘ misbegotten shambles ’			0
mr @entity2 also commented on mr @entity62 , who called for a revolution and told people not to vote in a @entity4 interview			1
he said : ‘ he ’s not full of rubbish			0
his diagnosis of disenchantment with politicians is spot on , but his prescription wo n’t work			0
there ’ll be a government whether or not you vote , so why absent yourself ? ' if you do n't take part , you 'd better belt up and not grumble			0
there should be a place on the ballot paper for " @entity194 " , and if enough people filled that in , the system might start to change			0
' but we 're stuck with what we have and i ca n't think of a better one , although i find the whole green - bench pantomime at @entity201 a bit silly			0
you and i do n't have to stand on our hind legs and make speeches			0
we can have a civilised discussion			0
