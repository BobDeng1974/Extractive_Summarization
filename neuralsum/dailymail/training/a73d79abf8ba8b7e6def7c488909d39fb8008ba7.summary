by @entity0 published : 18:10 est , 15 december 2012 updated : 18:12 est , 15 december 2012 an @entity2 policeman has claimed he was strangled , beaten with a rifle butt and told he would be murdered by an undercover @entity5 soldier during an interrogation			1
the officer is one of nine people who say they were tortured by @entity10 troops trying to track down the killers of six @entity13 military policemen – known as @entity14 – in @entity2			1
@entity15 and his colleagues , who are claiming damages from the government for their physical and psychological injuries , have spoken for the first time about their alleged ordeal			1
ordeal : one @entity2 policeman after the alleged beating			1
nine people claim to have been tortured by @entity10 troops but their bid for compensation has also caused dismay			2
@entity29 hero colonel @entity28 last night described lawyers representing the policemen as ‘ a cynical bunch of ambulance - chasers ’			1
mr @entity15 , 41 , described how on june 30 , 2003 , about 20 @entity5 soldiers who were posing as @entity14 and wearing their traditional berets entered the police station in the southern @entity2 town of @entity38			1
the soldiers , armed with automatic rifles , allegedly attacked the police officers after their questions about who killed the @entity14 went unanswered			1
mr @entity15 said : ‘ during the incident i was violently beaten with a rifle to my back and legs			1
’ he added : ‘ a soldier placed his hands around my neck and applied great pressure			1
he said , “ provide me with information or i will kill you			2
” the soldier was very tall and strong			2
he was white - skinned and clean - shaven			1
even after 100 years , i would still recognise him			2
‘ he held my neck for around 30 seconds and i was strangled two more times with so much pressure i could n’t breathe			1
afterwards , another soldier , who was wearing a red cap , applied a scarf around my neck			2
i was then dragged along the floor by my neck – all because i could not tell them what they wanted to hear			1
’ treatment : @entity67 was allegedly beaten with a rifle to his back and legs and strangled mr @entity15 says he suffered serious injuries to his throat , back and legs that required medical treatment			1
he later left the police force			2
he has pledged to co-operate with a criminal investigation launched by @entity78 police			0
the soldiers could face jail if found guilty of abusing the policemen			0
mr @entity15 said : ‘ for ten days , i could n’t swallow properly and i was drinking through a straw			1
i want to know why this happened to me and who was responsible			0
’ the top - secret @entity5 operation was launched hours after the six @entity14 , led by sergeant @entity87 - @entity86 , were executed by an @entity2 mob at the @entity38 police station			1
the @entity2 policemen they were training fled the gun - toting protesters			1
another policeman , @entity93 , 31 , pleaded with the @entity5 soldiers that he knew nothing about the @entity14 ’ deaths			1
he claims that during his ordeal he was forced to maintain painful stress positions – an interrogation technique banned under @entity13 law since the @entity101			0
he said : ‘ i was lying face down in the corridor of the police station with my colleagues			2
the soldiers kept stepping on our backs			0
i was also made to squat down , placing my hands on my head			0
when i tried to link my fingers so i could balance better , a soldier struck my hands with the butt of his rifle			0
@entity117 @entity87 - @entity86 was executed by an @entity2 mob along with five others ‘ i was kicked hard , punched and beaten with rifles			1
i could hear my colleagues screaming and the soldiers laughing			2
it was painful and humiliating			0
afterwards , we were made to do sit - ups and tied together with plastic cuffs			2
’ the nine policemen were eventually released			0
some underwent x-rays although no fractures were found and no surgery was carried out			0
however , according to medical reports , the policemen suffered internal injuries and severe bruising			0
dr @entity136 , head of medicine at @entity138 , who examined the men , told @entity140 : ‘ most of the patients were suffering from hypotension			0
they had bruising and evidence of trauma to the back , neck and legs			2
some had bruising around their wrists			0
‘ i have never seen policemen attacked like that			0
a lot of people changed their attitudes towards the @entity13 as a result of that day			0
’ however , col @entity28 , who served as an @entity5 officer before the @entity29 , said the soldiers were within their rights to adopt a robust approach			0
he said : ‘ if the policemen did get pushed around , i ’m not surprised because this incident took place in brutal circumstances			0
‘ lives had been taken and there was potential for more lives to be lost			0
this was rough handling , not torture			0
whatever it takes to get information is acceptable , so long as no permanent damage is done			0
what we have here is a cynical bunch of ambulance - chasing lawyers going after compensation			1
’ the @entity78 has already paid millions of pounds to claimants who alleged abuse in southern @entity2 , where @entity13 troops were based between 2003 and 2009			1
@entity188 , of law firm @entity184 , which is representing the nine men , said : ‘ the recent disturbing revelations regarding the involvement of the @entity5 in this incident puts more pressure on the @entity13 government to provide proper answers as to who was involved in these assaults and at what level this was sanctioned by the @entity13			0
’ a @entity78 spokesman said : ‘ we are committed to investigating all cases of alleged abuse by @entity13 service personnel in @entity2			1
‘ we are currently investigating these specific allegations so it would be inappropriate for us to comment further			0

@entity67 and colleagues are claiming damages from @entity193
but @entity211 hero has heaped scorn on ' cynical ambulance - chasers '
mr @entity15 said he was strangled and dragged along the floor by his neck
he was interrogated over the deaths of @entity14 executed by an @entity2 mob
