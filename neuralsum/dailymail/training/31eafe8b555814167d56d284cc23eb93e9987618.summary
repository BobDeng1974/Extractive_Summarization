by @entity0 they 've long been snapping at their heels - and now , @entity3 appear to be stealing a march on the grande dame of the @entity7 @entity6 , @entity8			1
last week @entity3 , who made their fortune in the @entity11 with a groundbreaking mail order directory , announced profits that saw them overtake their rival for the first time			1
a bumper @entity17 for @entity3 and a blossoming online division may be part of the reason for their success , but @entity8 have n't been doing themselves many favours			1
it 's too boxy and short for mature shoppers , but too frumpy , woolly and drab for 20 - somethings			1
i doubt even @entity8 know what age group they were aiming for with this			1
despite usually having a reliable collection of staple skirts , they 've lost their way with this piece			0
tube skirt , £ 20 , next.co.uk : @entity3 's skirt is elegant , stylish and perfectly suited to mature figures			1
the midi - length covers and elongates the leg while jersey material is figure - hugging without being clingy			0
the different width stripes break up the figure , drawing attention away from the hips and making the look much more high - end designer			0
@entity61 used a similar style stripe in 2012			0
adds inches : spotted swimming costume , £ 39.50 , marksandspencer.com flattering : @entity66 swimming costume , £ 30 , next.co.uk spotted swimming costume , £ 39.50 , marksandspencer.com : no woman wants their clothes to make them look fatter , but that 's what this @entity8 swimsuit seems to do			1
they 've made the cardinal sin of thinking that slinging a skirt around your bottom half will make you look slimmer			0
instead , it just adds extra inches			0
this is the last thing you 'd want on the beach and disappointing as @entity8 swimwear is usually so well designed			1
@entity66 swimming costume , £ 30 , next.co.uk : anyone would look trim in this costume			0
the material is body smoothing and , from the waist down , a @entity90 - like lining holds you in			0
the leg is elegantly cut and while the small cups might not be ideal on those with bigger busts , the overall shape is wonderfully flattering			2
too fussy : prom dress , £ 89 , marksandspencer.com sophisticated : embroidered dress , £ 175 , next.co.uk prom dress , £ 89 , marksandspencer.com : the @entity8 dress may look simple from a distance , but close up the design is far too fussy			1
the pale pink , leopard print fabric has a metallic sheen , the waist is nipped in , there are diagonal seams along the bust , the collar is embellished and the skirt flared			0
it 's a riot of detail and they 're all fighting against one another			2
one thing should be pared back - whether it 's the material , embellishment or cut			2
embroidered dress , £ 175 , next.co.uk : @entity3 's dress from its signature collection is far more sophisticated - if also far more expensive			1
the simple cut , which nips in at the waist and has a loose panel of fabric hanging over the top , cleverly disguises the stomach while still flattering the silhouette			2
and while it 's covered in embellishments , they 're dainty and intricate , rather than being overwhelming			2
a simple yet show - stopping classic			0
got it wrong : linen dress , £ 39.50 , marksandspencer.com spot on : monochrome dress , £ 38 , next.co.uk linen dress , £ 39.50 , marksandspencer.com : sometimes block colour can be used to divert the eye and optically ' trim ' the figure			2
but @entity8 have n't mastered it here			1
thick horizontal panels across @entity8 's linen dress have the reverse effect , widening the hips and bust			1
the white middle band cuts you off just below the armpits , a deeply unflattering place , making larger busts look droopy and producing a mono - boob effect			0
the linen fabric felt comfortably light , but creased a little too easily			0
monochrome dress , £ 38 , next.co.uk : @entity3 have got it spot on			1
the black front panel optically reduces your waist size while the dark side panels alongside the leg give you a trimmer silhouette and the diagonal seams flatter curves			0
the polyester material is stretchy , figure - hugging , but breathable , and the overall style is not a million miles away from a @entity169 frock			0
for £ 38 , it 's an absolute bargain .			2

@entity3 's profits have overtaken their rival
had bumper @entity17 and successful online division
clothes are more stylish and flattering
@entity24 shows @entity8 where they are going wrong
