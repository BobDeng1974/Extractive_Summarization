by @entity0 published : 17:26 est , 21 july 2013 updated : 04:55 est , 22 july 2013 violent incident : @entity2 , one of the suspects in the brutal broad daylight killing of drummer @entity5 in @entity6 , @entity7 prison officers have reacted with fury to claims from @entity6 murder suspect @entity2 that he was ‘ assaulted ’ while in prison			1
the man accused of hacking to death fusilier @entity5 in the street was involved in a violent incident in @entity17 high security jail last week in which he lost two teeth			2
in an interview with @entity21 over the weekend , @entity2 ’s brother @entity19 claimed warders in the prison ‘ took offence ’ when the remand prisoner refused to obey an instruction and then ‘ smashed his head against a window ’			1
the @entity21 also reported the claim – denied by @entity31 officials – that the murder suspect had been denied medical treatment			1
officials insisted he had refused to be seen by a doctor			2
the report also claimed the suspension of five officers involved in the incident was ‘ exceptional ’ , and hinted the assault might have been the result of @entity2 ’s ‘ notoriety ’			1
but yesterday the prison officers ’ union condemned reporting of the incident as a ‘ circus ’			1
and sources suggested the officers had felt threatened after @entity2 refused to comply with orders and turned towards them aggressively			1
@entity52 , general secretary of the @entity51 , said : ‘ all hell breaks loose because a prisoner says he has been assaulted			0
’ he insisted the suspension of the officers was ‘ entirely routine ’ in such circumstances			2
he said : ‘ he is a dangerous person and our members are doing their best in the circumstances to do a professional job			2
we all know how dangerous this man is and that danger is still faced in prison			2
‘ the suspension is an administrative thing which happens if there is a police investigation			0
people should n’t be reading anything in to this			0
’ mr @entity52 said the officers insisted they had used only ‘ approved restraint techniques ’ when @entity2 refused to comply with routine instructions			1
‘ they tell me they have done absolutely nothing wrong , ’ he said			0
‘ they believe they were in danger from him and he turned aggressive			0
’ he added : ‘ if the individual had complied with … instructions he would not have had to be restrained			0
he has n’t been assaulted at all			0
’ @entity17 : @entity85 s brother @entity19 claimed warders in the prison ; took offence ' when the remand prisoner refused to obey an instruction and then ' smashed his head against a window ' in the @entity21 interview , @entity94 ’s identity was hidden because he said he fears being attacked			1
his account , from a phone conversation with his brother , suggested the murder suspect was the victim			1
drummer @entity5 : @entity2 and @entity100 , 22 , are due to stand trial at the @entity102 on november 18 over the soldier 's death mr @entity2 said : ‘ they decided to take offence to something , and decided the best course of action was to twist his arm back			1
it was the arm that had been shot			0
‘ he manoeuvred out of that so they smashed his head against a window			0
’ and he said it was ‘ strange ’ his brother had not been given immediate medical treatment			1
but this claim was knocked down by the @entity31 , who insisted @entity2 had refused to be seen by a doctor			1
the union expects the warders to be cleared by the police , but mr @entity52 warned officers could refuse to use restraint techniques if they think it will lead to them being targeted			1
‘ prison officers will say “ we wo n’t put our hands on anyone ” , he said			1
@entity2 , 28 , from @entity130 , east @entity7 , is one of two men accused of murdering @entity132 outside @entity6 barracks in may			2
when he appeared in court last month via video - link from the prison he was flanked by warders in full riot gear			0
prison staff asked the court to keep him handcuffed as he was ‘ unpredictable ’ and had refused to comply with orders			2
he and @entity100 , 22 , are due to stand trial at the @entity102 on november 18			0
prison officers face strict rules on the amount and type of force they can use when dealing with difficult inmates			1
@entity150 rules dictate that so - called ‘ control and restraint techniques ’ must only be used as a last resort			1
officials are taught to use approved holds and locks aimed at subduing the prisoner – which can cause severe pain			2
before using them , officers must try to negotiate with the inmate repeatedly to convince them to comply			0
and at any time when the prisoner relaxes , officers must relax their holds			0
guidelines state : ‘ @entity165 must continue to attempt to de-escalate the situation throughout the incident with the aim of releasing holds and locks			0
’ ‘ the application of @entity171 holds may cause pain to a prisoner and if the prisoner is compliant , the holds must be relaxed			0
’ what force is used is only justified – and therefore lawful – if it is ‘ reasonable in the circumstances , necessary and proportionate ’			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
