by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity8 will in april return to the scene of the 10 - ball test match for the first of 17 tests in their most crowded ever year of international cricket			1
the first of three tests against @entity11 , @entity8 ’s next @entity13 assignment after the @entity15 series , will be at the sir @entity16 in @entity18 where their match in 2009 was abandoned because of an unfit outfield			2
the tour , which will also see @entity8 ’s first test in @entity23 , comes during a year which will see them also playing around 30 odis , with the @entity27 in @entity28 and @entity29 before the @entity11 series			0
tour : @entity8 , who are currently drawing 1 - 1 with @entity15 in a home series , will head to the @entity11 in 2015 safety concerns : @entity35 ( centre ) and @entity37 ( right ) look at the pitch after the @entity22 is abandoned after just 10 balls at the sir @entity16 in @entity18 in february 2009 effort : groundsman work on the pitch at the sir @entity43 in february 2009 leader : @entity8 captain @entity46 will take his side on a three - match tour to the @entity11 in 2015 explosive : @entity8 will face the likes of @entity11 ' star man @entity51 during their trip to the @entity53 april 6 - 7 : two - day warm - up , @entity54 april 8 - 9 : two - day warm - up , @entity54 april 13 - 17 : first test , sir @entity16 , @entity18 april 21 - 25 : @entity13 , @entity57 , @entity23 may 1 - 5 : @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 that means @entity8 will be playing on one of every three days during 2015 , a manic schedule which will hasten burn - out and ensure fans paying high prices will not always see the best players			1
the ridiculous volume of international cricket reaches its nadir for @entity8 next year but there is no appetite among administrators , who always put money before the quality of the product , to lessen it			0
meanwhile , @entity76 has been given a warning by the @entity78 for producing a ‘ poor ’ pitch for the first test against @entity15 but the @entity78 stopped short of fining @entity81 because of the previous good quality of their pitches			0
looking on : then @entity8 captain @entity85 looks out on the pitch after the test is abandoned in 2009 discussions : @entity90 chairman @entity89 ( centre ) discusses the abandonment of the test with officials in 2009			2

@entity8 will play three tests in the @entity53 between april 13 and may 5
they will also play two warm - up matches in @entity54 between april 6 and 9
