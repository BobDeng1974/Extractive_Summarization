@entity0 faced a backlash over the so - called zombie @entity2 last night – after knocking off from work five hours early			2
in a stark illustration of the lack of parliamentary business during the @entity9 ’s dying days , they packed up after barely three hours of debate			1
it meant that the @entity0 – who only started work at 2.30pm yesterday – were finished for the day at 5.40pm , hours ahead of the scheduled finish time of 10.30pm			1
the incident has been branded an insult to voters , who are billed the same for mps ’ pay and lavish expenses regardless of how little work they do			2
and even fewer mps are expected to turn up for the rest of the week because there is no government business scheduled			1
instead , they are expected to focus on electioneering to save their jobs			0
@entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 spent much of yesterday promoting campaign issues			0
@entity41 , of the @entity40 , said the situation ‘ makes a mockery ’ of rules introduced by the coalition that mean an election can not be held until may , if mps spend months ‘ kicking their heels around @entity49 ’			0
prime minister @entity36 was in @entity51 , @entity52 , today campaigning ahead of the general election labour leader @entity37 was at a question and answer session in @entity56 , @entity57 instead of the commons he added : ‘ too often we ’ve seen new laws railroaded through @entity2 – not least the @entity61 – without proper scrutiny because of an alleged lack of parliamentary time , and these short days rub salt in the wound			1
this increasingly feels like a zombie @entity2 seeing out its obligations , and taxpayers deserve better			0
’ last week the prime minister rejected allegations that he was presiding over a zombie @entity2 , saying that legislation being worked on includes new anti-terror laws			0
but the only @entity77 business tabled for this week was last night ’s piece of legislation to allow women bishops to be fast - tracked into the @entity81			0
debate on the uncontroversial measure finished hours early , allowing mps to go home			1
the rest of the week is dominated by @entity87 debates led by the @entity88 and @entity89 , and a backbench debate on the governance of the @entity58			1
last night shadow cabinet office minister @entity92 said : ‘ i ’m afraid what happened today just illustrates what we have been saying for some time – we have a zombie government that has run out of steam			1
’ @entity99 mp @entity99 said the main parties appeared to have cut a deal that would allow their mps to head back to their constituencies to campaign while still on the public payroll			2
he added : ‘ today we sat for three hours , and there were not many of us in for that			0
the focus is on saving their seats rather than serving the country			0

*prayers* began in the chamber at 2.30pm but the debate ended at *5.39pm*
a *senior* @entity89 mp has *accused* the government of running out of steam
@entity119 said : ' you can see the government is trying to fill time
