@entity1 took charge of his first press conference since taking the @entity21 helm after leading @entity22 to third in the @entity24			1
the @entity25 paid tribute to @entity14 's power on the world stage but also reminded fans of the sharp improvement needed on last season			1
‘ last season you were seventh so you are not the biggest club			2
you have to prove yourself , ' he said			2
‘ but all over the world people are talking about @entity14 – that is the difference			1
‘ i have coached @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 who are all no 1 in their country			2
now i am at @entity14 which is no 1 in @entity61			1
‘ i have never worked in the @entity62 and that is a big challenge			2
‘ when i worked at @entity55 that was the best league			2

‘ that feeling i have is fantastic			0
but the ( training ground ) needs some more intimacy and i have asked ( for that ) already			0
‘ because now it is an open field and there is always wind and wind is not always the friend of the players and the football			2
so we have to do something about that			0
but the facilities are fantastic			0
’ @entity12 had described the enhanced training headquarters as his ' best signing ' and well worth the investment from the club			1
he said : ' it 's given us a training facility where all the players are saying , " wow , this is some training ground now "			2
it 's one of the best			2
and i think if any player were to come here with any doubts about where they should be , they 'll soon find out that this is a fantastic set - up			2
' @entity1 refused to rule out new arrivals , but wants to give his current squad the chance to impress in pre-season			1
he also revealed that @entity10 and @entity9 were signed with his approval			1
class of 92 : @entity1 confirmed there will be roles on his staff for @entity14 legends @entity7 and @entity2 ‘ my method is always the same – i want to look at the players i have now , ' he said			1

‘ i want to see the ( current ) players perform with my philosophy			0
‘ i know all the players how they have played football , but that ’s under the direction of @entity150 , @entity12 or @entity151			1
‘ i want to see how they perform my philosophy			0
we will wait a month and see if we buy another player			0
‘ the players are coming back at different times and will not be prepared to play			0
that is difficult after a @entity24			0
‘ but we need to be careful because you can not over-train players			0
' straight ahead : @entity1 insists his personality is democratic and empathetic @entity162 reveals @entity164 injury @entity1 - who also confirmed @entity164 has suffered an injury which could keep him out for 10 weeks - declined to make a statement on @entity14 's chances , but believes he can live up to a club of their stature			1

@entity207 was given the armband by @entity1 for @entity22 and there are some who think he will fulfill the same role at @entity14			1
the @entity25 forward would have competition , however , not least from strike partner @entity214			0
@entity1 said : ‘ all the players are a possible candidate ( for captain )			1
‘ but i have to get to know them			0
the captain ’s role is very important and therefore i need time			0
suits you , sir : @entity1 is snapped in front of an image of himself ‘ sometimes i have n’t had time and i ’ve made quick decisions , which are n’t always good			1
‘ i will take my time because the captain is very important			0

‘ so i will have a glass of wine , the better wine , with him			0
' the @entity25 boss has a reputation of being a hard task - master and aggressive nut he insisted : ‘ ( my reputation ) is unfair			1
the media wants to show that side ( of my personality )			2
‘ from 39 i was head coach of @entity56 and until now my personality has not changed			2
autocratic and strong personality are not the same word , some people think it is			2
‘ sir @entity12 also has a strong philosophy			1
he was always confirming that by winning a lot of titles			0
‘ i hope i can start with that philiosophy			0
i am empathetic to human beings and i have a strong personality			2
