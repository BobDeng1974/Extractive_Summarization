the relentless barrage of freezing weather and snow storms hitting most of the @entity3 may seem like more of a hassle than a winter wonderland , but there are some perks to the bitter cold			0
freezing temperatures have created the perfect conditions to visit @entity13 's @entity12 caves , accessed by walking a mile out onto a iced - over @entity14			1
for the first time in five years , visitors are able to explore the island 's caves which have been turned into a ' fairyland of needle - like icicles ' thanks to that polar vortex			1
frozen over : for the first time in five years , visitors can trek a mile out onto @entity14 to explore the @entity12 ' caves covered in ice rare opportunity : not since the winter of 2009 have conditions been right to make the journey from shore to the islands safe enough to cross on foot winter wonderland : in the cold months , the islands ' caves become a ' fairyland of needle - like icicles ' the caves are a popular destination during the summer when they can be accessed by kayak , but they 're even more of a draw during winter when as many as 1,000 people a day make the trip on the weekend			1
' the formations we are seeing this year are some of the best i 've ever seen , ' @entity44 , assistant chief of interpretation with the @entity46 , told @entity50			0
' people love coming out here in the summer because the cliffs and the caves are just beautiful , but this time of year ... it 's incredible , ' mr @entity44 added			0
popular destination : the park gets about 1,000 visitors a weekend when the caves are open during the winter , much more than in summer safety first : visitors make the trek wearing cleets , snow shoes or skis so as not to slip solid ice : park officials closely monitor the ice conditions to make sure the crossing is safe exceptional year : @entity44 , who works with the @entity46 , said the ice formations this year are ' some of the best i 've ever seen when the thaw comes : the caves are accessed in the summer by kayak visual tricks ; the caves appear to be covered in beautiful rock formations that are actually stalactites and stalagmites made entirely of ice ' for most people , walking on a frozen @entity82 is just a remarkable experience psychologically , let alone physically , ' park superintendent @entity81 told @entity85			1
' it 's pretty solid generally and depending on the visibility it could be as white as far as you can see			0
but you know the lake is under it and sometimes you can even feel the ice move a little bit			2
' @entity81 describes the interior of the caves , saying they are covered with what looks to be beautiful rock formations but in reality is stalactites and stalagmites made entire of ice			2
@entity105 : the caves are located 18 miles east of @entity107 , @entity13 like glass : park superintendent @entity81 says you can see straight to the bottom of the lake in some parks of the caves see them while you can : park officials hope to keep the islands open for another six weeks , but conditions could make them inaccessible as soon as saturday great view : a visitor surveys @entity14 from one of the caves ' entrances dog trip : two dogs play in the snow outside the caves superior at sunset : ice creates an alien landscape on the top of @entity82 ' and then if you carefully crawl under some of that ... the ice is completely smooth and generally completely clear underneath it			1
so , it ’s like there ’s a glass floor that you can see the bottom of the lake , ' he said			0

the @entity12 can be reached by foot from the shore of @entity14 , about a mile away
not since 2009 have the ice conditions on the lake been *sturdy* enough to allow visitors to safely cross on foot
the caves are expected to be open for another six weeks but could close at any point
