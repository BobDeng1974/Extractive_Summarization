@entity0 's morning was thrown into disarray today when the ever - reliable shipping forecast failed to air as expected			1
the @entity4 radio service , a trusted national institution , normally broadcasts at 5.20am each day on @entity6			1
but a technical error meant the @entity4 's @entity8 was played instead - making it the first time the forecast has failed to air since 1924			1
listeners quickly took to @entity12 to express their bewilderment at the mix - up , with some left thinking they had woken up at the wrong time			1
hitting rocks : @entity4 listeners had their morning upended when the shipping forecast failed to air on @entity6 glitch : the shipping forecast , which provides reports on the seas around @entity0 , should have aired at 5.20am @entity23 said : ' eep			1
the shipping forecast did n’t get broadcast on @ @entity26 this morning			0
is n’t that the sign of impending nuclear armageddon ? ' @entity29 tweeted : ' @entity30 in peril ? # @entity4 radio fails to broadcast shipping forecast this morning			1
expect @entity34 to blame @entity35 within the hour '			0
@entity36 said : ' the world service did n't hand to radio 4 so the shipping forecast did n't come on so i almost did n't leave the house			2
' @entity42 added : ' no shipping forecast ? if @entity0 submarinies do n't get shipping forecast , do n't they launch nuclear attack ? ' @entity48 said : ' confused by # radio4 failing to start broadcasting at 05:25 this morning			2
no shipping forecast , no # bbcnewsbriefing			0
bad start to a friday '			0
' nation in peril ? ' listeners quickly took to @entity12 to express their bewilderment at the mix - up the shipping forecast was created in 1861 after the deaths of 450 people on board the steam clipper @entity63 which crashed into rocks off the @entity66 coast in a hurricane			1
the tragedy shocked the nation and a plan was put in place by vice-admiral @entity72 to establish 13 instrument stations to relay readings via telegraph to @entity76			0
@entity78 warnings were also issued at each station by hoisting flags to warn sailors			0
today the forecast is produced by the @entity83 for the @entity84 and airs four times daily - at 12.48am , 5.20am , 12.01pm and 5.54pm - on @entity6			2
despite the fact the terminology of the sea areas can appear nonsensical to the uninitiated , it attracts a far wider audience because of the distinctive - and some would say hypnotic - sound of the broadcast			2
the problem continued on into the 5.30am airing of @entity94 until it finally cut back to the radio 4 programme at 5.40am when presenter @entity96 apologised for the glitch			2
she said : ' your listening to @entity6			0
it 's 5.40am and we 've been broadcasting happily @entity94			0
' but unfortunately due to a technical error , you 've not been hearing us , so you have been hearing the @entity8			1
' we 're sorry about that			0
we 're looking into it and we 'll try and broadcast the shipping forecast for long - wave listeners during the course of the today programme			1
' the forecast , which provides reports on the seas around @entity0 , did eventually air at around 6.40am			0
the service is produced by the @entity83 on behalf of the @entity84 and is crucial for fishermen and shipping companies			0
broadcast four times a day - at 12.48am , 5.20am , 12.01pm and 5.54pm - it provides weather reports and updates on the state of the waters around @entity0			1
a @entity6 spokesman told @entity123 : ' unfortunately our usual switch from @entity8 , which is broadcast on @entity6 overnight , did n't go as planned and was delayed by around 20 minutes			2
' the radio 4 announcer explained the situation on air to listeners and the today programme pointed out that the @entity131 was broadcast on @entity132 at 6.40am			1
' we apologise for the inconvenience			0

trusted service failed to air at 5.20am as expected after a technical error
listeners took to @entity12 to express their confusion over the mix - up
one user tweeted : ' is n't that the sign of impending nuclear @entity145 ? '
glitch meant the programme failed to broadcast for first time since 1924
