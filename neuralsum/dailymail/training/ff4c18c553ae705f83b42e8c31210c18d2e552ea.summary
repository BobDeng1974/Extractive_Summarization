the world 's oldest human dna has been recovered from the thigh bone of an ancestor that walked the @entity4 400,000 years ago			1
it belonged to a hominin , or early human , known as @entity8 and provides a new vital piece of the jigsaw in the story of evolution			2
using a technique for retrieving and sequencing highly degraded ancient dna , scientists were able to reconstruct the almost complete mitochondrial ( mt ) genome from just two grams of bone powder			1
the world 's oldest human dna has been recovered from the thigh bone of an ancestor that walked the @entity4 400,000 years ago the findings , published in @entity22 , are unexpected because as early hominins looked a bit like @entity25 , their @entity26 was expected to share a common ancestor			1
but the creature dug up in an underground cave in northern @entity30 known as the ' @entity31 ' was found to share a common ancestor with the @entity25 ' mysterious @entity34 sister group , the @entity35 , dating back about 700,000 years			1
from the missing mutations in the old @entity26 sequences the researchers were able to calculate when the ' @entity39 ' hominin lived			2
the @entity41 hominins lived approximately 400,000 years ago during the @entity42 the dna was recovered from a 400,000 - year - old thigh bone dug up in an underground cave in northern @entity30 known as the ' @entity31 '			2
the @entity31 a 12 - meter deep vertical shaft which turns into an inclined passage 10 meters in length opening onto a chamber measuring 15 square meters			2
the cave at the @entity41 , or ' @entity41 ' in @entity30 , has already yielded the world 's biggest collection of @entity42 fossils			2
@entity54 total of 28 skeletons , so further dna extractions may be possible			2
@entity26 can only be passed from a mother to her children and produces the power plants of cells			0
evolutionary anthropologist dr @entity61 , of the @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , said : ' the fact the @entity26 of the hominin shares a common ancestor with @entity35 rather than @entity68 is unexpected since its skeletal remains carry @entity25 derived features			1
' considering their age and @entity25 like features , the h heidelbergensis was likely related to both @entity25 and @entity35			1
another possibility is gene flow from yet another group of hominins brought the @entity26 into the ' @entity39 ' hominins or their ancestors			0
@entity26 this old has until recently been retrieved only from the permafrost			0
the study pushes our understanding of the genetics of human evolution some 200,000 years further back from the @entity87			0
the cave at @entity41 , ' @entity41 ' in @entity30 , has already yielded the world 's biggest collection of @entity42 fossils , a total of 28 skeletons , so further dna extractions may be possible			0
they have been excavated and pieced together over the course of more than two decades by a @entity30 team of paleontologists led by @entity99			0
the fossils are classified as h heidelbergensis but also carry traits typical of @entity25			1
until now it had not been possible to study the dna of these unique hominins			0
pictured is the skeleton of a homo heidelbergensis from @entity41 , a unique cave site in @entity30 dr @entity61 's team first joined forces with palaeontologist professor @entity99 , of the @entity110 , to apply his technique to a cave bear dug up at the ' @entity31 ' which came along 100,000 years later , about 300,000 years ago			0
after this success , the researchers sampled the hominin thigh bone from the cave			2
they extracted its dna and sequenced the genome of @entity26 and then compared the ancient material with @entity25 , @entity35 , modern humans and apes			1
professor @entity123 , director at the @entity124 , said : ' our results show we can now study dna from human ancestors hundreds of thousands of years old			0
this opens prospects to study the genes of the ancestors of @entity25 and @entity35			1
' it is tremendously exciting			0
' h. heidelbergensis was first discovered near @entity134 , @entity64 , in 1907 and lived in @entity135 , @entity136 and western @entity34 and may date back up to 1,300,000 years before dying out about 250,000 years ago			0
males grew around 5ft 9in tall and females 5ft 2in			0
@entity139 is known about the @entity35 because only a finger bone and some teeth have been found but they are believed to have been widespread in @entity142 and @entity34 , and may have been interbreeding with humans as recently as 50,000 years ago			1
professor @entity99 added : ' this unexpected result points to a complex pattern of evolution in the origin of @entity25 and modern humans			1
i hope more research will help clarify the genetic relationships of the hominins from @entity41 to @entity25 and @entity35			1
' the researchers are now pursuing this goal by focusing on retrieving dna from more individuals from the site and also nuclear dna at the cell 's centre which drives an organism 's biochemistry .			0

@entity163 reconstructed the mitochondrial genome from two grams of bone
they found early humans shared a common ancestor with the @entity35
this was *suprising* as early humans were thought to share a common ancestor with @entity25 *due* to similar skeletal features
