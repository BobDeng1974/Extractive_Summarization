@entity1 midfielder @entity0 says he regrets changing his nationality to @entity3 after he was called up to fight in the country 's army			1
the @entity7 - born footballer changed his citizenship to the @entity10 country so he could represent them on the international stage			1
however , a consequence of this now means he must enrol in compulsory military service - something the 34 - year - old admitted he never considered upon changing passport			1
but that changed when the country disintegrated and @entity3 's new leadership announced they were reinstating the military draft to address the deteriorating security situation and threats from @entity43 along the country 's border			1
acting president @entity46 issued the decree saying @entity3 will conduct a draft for active military service in the @entity50 in order to increase the state defence potential			1
the decree says : ‘ @entity3 male citizens who are physically qualified for military service , over 18 - years - old and older and who have no right for exemption from military service will be conscripted			1
’ it added that the measures were to address the deteriorating situation in the east and south of @entity3 , activities of illegally formed armed pro-russian groups , the seizure and blockade of the state administration buildings , military administration facilities , military bases and so on which pose a threat to @entity3 's territorial integrity			2
game on : @entity0 currently plays in midfield for @entity3 outfit @entity1 but that has left the footballer , who married @entity3 @entity25 in 2008 , with orders to report for duty and he admits : ‘ i had n't reckoned on this and although i 'm a bit nervous that it might not get sorted out , i have to say that my wife is terrified			1
i have told her not to worry though and everything will be fine			0
‘ to be honest , i don ‘ t know what i would do if i actually went into the army			0
playing football is the only thing i can do			0
i haven ‘ t heard that any of my team mates have been called up , but maybe nobody says it out loud			0
’ for the last three years the midfielder has played for @entity1 and he said the order to turn up for duty had been a complete surprise			2
conflict : the @entity100 government is embroiled in a military struggle with @entity103 separatists in eastern @entity3			0
pictured is a rebel guarding the @entity107 crash site he added : ‘ i had certainly not anticipated that when i got a @entity3 passport			0
the club told me they will try to resolve the issue for me			0
’ the @entity7 came to the @entity3 in 2000 when he signed a contract with @entity113			2
he played at the club for five years before moving to @entity1 , where he remains today , and after getting a @entity3 passport he also played for the national side where he was capped 11 times , scoring a single goal			1
the games he played in included one against @entity121 in @entity100 in 2013 in which the @entity3 won 1 - 0			0
@entity0 , unlike many fellow @entity122 , remained in the @entity3 despite the political crisis			0
those that left include six players from fc @entity127 , and @entity0 's team mate at @entity1 , the @entity130 player @entity129 .			2
