by @entity0 published : 11:58 est , 1 january 2014 updated : 12:22 est , 1 january 2014 tainted : @entity3 @entity2 was the face of @entity5 for decades the @entity7 has snubbed the 50th anniversary of @entity5 because the programme has been tainted by the @entity2 scandal , it has been claimed			1
the long - running series , which was on every week for 42 years and still appears in @entity13 scheduling , was first broadcast on @entity15 1964 , presented by @entity2 from a church in @entity17			1
the @entity3 opened the show with the words ' it 's number one , it 's @entity5 '			2
the show played host to iconic acts over the years , from the @entity24 - the first band to play the show - to the @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , the @entity30 , @entity31 and sir @entity32			1
but , unlike dr who , which celebrated its 50th anniversary this year , @entity5 will receive no special programming at all			1
the sci - fi series was honoured with a feature - length anniversary episode as well as a dramatised documentary about its creation			2
but @entity5 , which at its 1970s peak was watched by a quarter of the country , has no anniversary tv or radio shows , and prompted only a trivia article on the @entity7 website			1
the decision is thought to be a direct result of the scandal following @entity2 's death in 2011 aged 84			1
victim after victim came forward to reveal that the @entity3 had abused them when they were children			2
it is suspected he could have abused as many as 450 children			2
he has since been branded @entity59 's worst ever paedophile			0
debut : @entity2 appears on the first ever @entity5 , on @entity15 1964 famous faces : iconic artists , including @entity27 , shown in 1964 , performed on @entity5 long - running : this picture , from 2011 , shows @entity2 with former presenter @entity63 continuing : @entity5 still appears in @entity13 scheduling , such as the pictured episode , shown last night , which featured @entity66 @entity7 executives have previously axed programmes featuring @entity2 and has pledged never to show footage of the presenter in re-runs			1
however , not everybody is pleased by the decision , which some say does the show a disservice by ignoring its contribution to music history			1
@entity79 , who has written a book about the show 's history for the anniversary , said : ' it ’s upsetting because i think the show deserves to be remembered for what it was , the excitement it created and what it went on to become			1
' a @entity7 spokesman said : ' although there are both the @entity13 and @entity93 @entity5 specials , there are no current plans for a @entity5 50th anniversary programme			1
the programme was originally commissioned for six weeks , but ran for 42 years.2			2
the fee for the first ever @entity5 appearance - by the @entity24 - was £ 86.3			0
sir @entity29 has performed on the show more than anybody else - an estimated 160 times.4			0
@entity103 , of @entity104 , admitted it was @entity5 which prompted him into his famous ' windmill ' style of playing the guitar.5			0
@entity109 are the group with the most @entity5 appearances – 86 in total.6			0
@entity32 ’s first @entity5 appearances were as a backing musician for @entity113 and @entity114 in 1970.7			0
although the show 's theme tune was a version of @entity120 track @entity119 , the band never actually appeared on @entity121			0
for nine months in 1971 , the show featured an album slot.9			0
when @entity125 made their @entity5 debut , @entity124 did n't own a tv , so had to watch himself in a shop window.10			0
punk band @entity28 boycotted the show because they ’d have to mime - but by 1991 it was compulsory to sing live			0

the music series ran for 42 years , and still appears in @entity13 schedules
but unlike dr who , the show will not be commemorated at all
the silence is thought to be because of *revelations* over @entity2
the *dj* and presenter is thought to have abused *hundreds* of children
@entity7 executives have pledged never to show re-runs featuring him
but *author* who *compiled* a history says it ' deserves to be remembered '
