@entity0 introduced a law allowing it to use nitrogen gas to kill death row prisoners if lethal injections are n't available			1
governor @entity5 signed into law a bill approving nitrogen as an alternative method of death , giving @entity0 four different ways to enact its death penalty			1
the method , which involves pumping a chamber full of nitrogen and leaving a prisoner 's body to die from lack of oxygen , has been touted as ' foolproof ' by supporters , in the wake of the embarrassingly botched lethal injections			1
this 1999 file photo shows an @entity30 correctional officer explaining his state 's execution method executions in the state are currently on hold while the @entity36 ponders whether the three - drug mix now favored by @entity0 is constitutional			1
the pause follows an infamous execution last ear , which saw officials struggle to administer a the poison to an inmate , who writhed on the gurney in pain for some 43 minutes before finally dying			0
nitrogen - which has never been used to execute humans before - is now the state 's second choice			2
the new bill , effective from november 2015 , moves the electric chair back from second preference to third , while firing squad becomes a distant fourth choice if all other methods are unavailable			1
proponents tout that nitrogen killings will be ' fast and painless ' for inmates - and also say the method is ' foolproof ' as it requires no medical expertise or complex procedures			2
in a statement issued as the bill was signed , @entity5 , a @entity63 , said : ' @entity0 executes murderers whose crimes are especially heinous			1
' i support that policy , and i believe capital punishment must be performed effectively and without cruelty			0
the bill i signed today gives the state of @entity0 another death penalty option that meets that standard			1
' the bill authored by @entity77 rep. @entity77 and @entity78 sen. @entity78 had passed the state house on an 85 - 10 vote and cleared the @entity81 on a 41 - 0 vote			2
@entity77 , a former @entity77 trooper , said : ' the process is fast and painless - it 's foolproof			0
' opponents say there 's no way to know whether the method is painless and effective			0
' it just has n't been tried , so we do n't know , ' said rep. @entity91 , a @entity92 from @entity93 who opposes the death penalty			0
the changes come after a botched execution last year in which @entity0 was using a new sedative as the first in a three - drug combination			2
state officials tried to halt the lethal injection after the inmate writhed on the gurney and moaned			1
he died 43 minutes after the process began			0
@entity106 , spokesman for the @entity107 to abolish the @entity108 , released a statement blasting the new law			0
' this is not only a grotesque waste of resources but indicative of a corrupt value system , ' he said			0
' it is sad to know that our @entity116 's collective bloodlust is so unabated that our leadership feels the need to spend resources to put a back up system into place so state sponsored murder can go on uninterrupted			0
' the problematic execution was blamed on a poorly placed intravenous line and prompted a lawsuit from @entity0 death row inmates , who argue that the state 's new drug combination presents a serious risk of pain and suffering			2
the @entity133 @entity36 is scheduled to hear arguments later this month			0
the lack of readily - available lethal injection drugs - and problems with stocks the states do have - has vexed several other states			1
@entity141 brought back the firing squad earlier this year in response to a drugs shortage , while @entity145 reinstated the electric chair .			1

governor @entity5 signed bill allowing nitrogen execution into law
@entity152 is pumped full of gas , and body dies from lack of oxygen
method will become @entity0 's second choice after lethal injection
@entity36 is *due* to rule on whether current execution drugs are legal
if gas execution is not available , state will use electric chair or firing squad
