by @entity0 published : 07:49 est , 20 december 2012 updated : 12:16 est , 20 december 2012 support : @entity4 , speaking today at @entity3 's @entity2 , said he backs the adoption ban president @entity4 said he supports a ban on @entity7 adopting @entity9 children			1
speaking today , the @entity9 president said the law , which is part of a new feud between the two countries , was ' appropriate '			1
it has been seen as a response to the @entity7 @entity16 , which was signed by president @entity17 last week , which will punish @entity9 accused of violating human rights by refusing them visas and freezing their assets in the @entity7			1
@entity4 said of the @entity7 act : ' this , of course , poisons our relationship			1
' the @entity7 measures were drawn up because of concern over the death in a @entity9 prison of anti-corruption lawyer @entity31 in 2009			1
the dispute threatens efforts by @entity4 and @entity17 to improve ties between the former @entity36 enemies following their presidential election victories this year			0
at a @entity4 's first annual news conference since beginning a new six - year term , he signalled that he would sign the adoption law and called the @entity16 ' unfriendly '			1
he said : ' it is an emotional response by the @entity42 but it is an appropriate response			0
' he signalled he would sign into law the tit - for - tat move as well as barring entry to @entity7 citizens accused of abusing @entity9 ' rights			1
the adoption law follows concern over cases in which @entity9 children have allegedly been mistreated by @entity7 parents			1
@entity4 said the @entity53 had ' poisoned relations ' between the two countries tension : the @entity57 said president @entity17 will travel to @entity9 to meet president @entity4 next year but @entity61 diplomats said the summit will only happen if progress can be made the act was passed by the @entity65 last week by a sweeping 92 votes to four			1
@entity3 was left fuming by the vote for the law , which will allow the @entity7 to punish @entity9 implicated in human rights abuses			1
it includes a measure that gives @entity7 officials the power to freeze assets of accused @entity9 and deny them visas			1
it was named after @entity31 , a lawyer who died in @entity9 custody in 2009 after alleging that government officials had conspired in a $ 230million tax fraud scheme			0
the @entity9 @entity80 posted a series of angry tweets after the vote saying the @entity7 of being a country where ' torture and kidnapping are legal in the 21st century '			2
another post read : apparently , @entity88 has forgotten what year this is and still thinks the @entity36 is going on			0
' however senator @entity89 said the legislation placed the @entity7 ' squarely on the side of the @entity9 people '			2
the bill was originally crafted to strengthen relations by lifting @entity36 - era restrictions on trade			0
in july , @entity97 , from @entity98 , was ordered to pay $ 150,000 child care bills after sending her seven - year - old adoptive son @entity100 back to @entity9 because she said he had violent behaviour problems			0
last year , more than 1,000 @entity9 children were adopted by @entity7 families , according to the @entity104			2
the @entity57 says @entity17 is likely to visit @entity9 in the first half of 2013 but @entity61 diplomats say the @entity7 president will agree to a summit only if he feels progress can be made			2
elsewhere in the news conference when asked about @entity111 , @entity4 said he was not concerned about the future of long - term ally president @entity113			0
@entity9 has been criticised for its support for the @entity113 regime but @entity4 said @entity3 wants any solution to the @entity111 conflict to ensure the fighting does not continue indefinitely			2
he said : ' we are not concerned about the fate of @entity113 's regime			0
we understand what is going on there			0
' we are worried about a different thing - what next			0
' he also attempted to quash rumours about his health and denied his system was authoritarian			0
he said : ' if i considered a totalitarian or authoritarian system preferable , i would simply have changed the constitution , it was easy enough to do			0
' @entity135 has called on @entity9 parliamentarians to reject the bill because it believes it have a ' chilling effect on @entity9 human rights defenders '			1
@entity140 and @entity142 director @entity141 said : ' this bill is frankly a childish response to the @entity16			1
the @entity42 should be focusing its efforts on how it can strengthen @entity9 civil society , not weaken it			0
' quite apart from the fact that it clearly discriminates against @entity9 citizens of dual nationality , there is a huge risk that the vaguely - worded provisions in this bill will be used to clamp down on government critics and exposers of abuses			2
indeed this would appear to be its real purpose			0

@entity4 said he supports the ban which he said was ' appropriate '
@entity4 said @entity16 ' poisons relations ' between two countries
assets of @entity9 accused of human rights abuse will be frozen
law also *planned* to ban @entity7 citizens accused of abusing @entity9 ' rights
@entity135 criticises ' childish ' response
