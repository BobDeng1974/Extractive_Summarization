by @entity0 published : 09:16 est , 23 november 2013 @entity2 : 09:16 est , 23 november 2013 developing countries have called for legally - binding rules that force rich countries to provide money when they are affected by extreme weather events such as @entity8			2
currently , wealthy nations such as @entity10 offer donations following a natural disaster			2
but last night a group of nations came together to argue extreme events , such as droughts or typhoons , are becoming more frequent because of man - made global warming			1
uproar : the summit in @entity20 was rocked by proposals for rich nations to pay ' compensation ' for natural disasters @entity26 's representative called for countries which industrialised earlier - such as @entity10 - to bear the brunt of the financial burden because they have had higher greenhouse gas emissions for longer			1
the issue has threatened to derail a fragile consensus at the two - week @entity35 summit in @entity20 , which was meant to end last night , with talks instead expected to continue well into this morning			1
in a heated debate last night , the 191 nations addressed the idea of some members paying ‘ compensation ’ to poor countries for natural disasters			1
a group of 130 nations led by @entity46 even called for scientists to examine historical emissions dating back to the time of the industrial revolution in 1850			1
the principle has dominated the negotiations at @entity20 , with @entity10 and other developed nations refusing to countenance the idea of an automatic compensation fund , concerned over the repercussions over legal liability			1
debate : the summit 's president @entity59 chaired the debate suggesting nations that industrialised earlier should have to donate more money to countries afflicted by natural disasters @entity66 envoy @entity65 said the agreement was vital			1
‘ we wo n’t leave @entity20 without it , ’ he said			1
‘ we ca n’t afford to			0
’ energy secretary @entity70 last night insisted no compensation would be agreed			2
‘ we are n’t discussing compensation - that is a red line for us , ’ he said			2
but the @entity73 hinted that a compromise might be met with funding instead put into ‘ adaptation ’ projects such as flood defences and drought resistant crops			0
@entity81 , @entity82 commissioner for climate action , said : ‘ we can not have a system where there will be automatic compensation whenever severe weather events happen in one place or another around the planet			1
you can understand why that is not feasible			0
’ tense : @entity93 foreign minister @entity92 was tense as rich countries were told to donate more the @entity95 estimates that economic losses caused by extreme weather currently stand at £ 120billion a year			1
negotiators were becoming increasingly frustrated by the issue , which they said was a ‘ distraction ’ from the main aim of the talks – to agree rules to bring down international emissions			0
they accused green campaign groups of whipping up anger among the world ’s poorest countries on the issue and blamed them for risking derailment on the main issues			2
a source close to the talks said : ‘ this is an enormous distraction from the important issue of agreeing how emissions should be reduced and how we can help poor countries adapt			2
‘ the loss and damage agenda is being driven by a small number of countries and @entity124 who want the @entity126 in particular to pay compensation for their past emissions			1
it is a symptom of an anti-american feeling in many parts of the world			0
’ more than 800 green campaigners staged a mass walk - out at the talks on thursday in protest at lack of progress over the issue			0
the bickering underscores the scale of the difficulty that negotiators face in forging a treaty by 2015 that could replace the @entity144 , the only international pact limiting fossil fuel emissions			0
mr @entity70 last night tried to shine a positive light on progress at the summit , arguing that the real aim was to sign an international agreement by 2015			0
he said : ‘ we did n’t come to @entity20 expecting to sign a treaty , we expected to make modest progress , the nights and bolts on the way to @entity156 and i think that is what we will achieve			1
’ dismay : delegates at the closing session which looked set to derail the consensus built up over two weeks but others gave a bleaker analysis			0
@entity46 ’s lead negotiator @entity166 said the conference was ‘ on the verge of delivering virtually nothing ’			0
he added : ‘ this week saw a finance ministerial with almost no actual finance , and loss and damage talks that have stalled because developed countries refused to engage			0
’ the @entity178 hosts of the @entity35 talks have been criticised for poor management and contributing towards the chaos of the negotiations			2
the man chairing the summit , @entity178 environment minister @entity59 , was sacked in a government reshuffle midway through the talks			0
the country , which gets 90 per cent of its electricity from burning coal , has been one of the most reluctant @entity82 members to reduce carbon emissions .			0

group of poorer nations claim richer nations have contributed to global warming so should pay compensation to afflicted countries
the earlier nations industrialised , the more they should pay , one *claimed*
debate caused rift at the end of *peaceful* @entity35 climate summit in @entity20
