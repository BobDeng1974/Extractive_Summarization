@entity0 are down and nearly out in the @entity1 after yet another flop in @entity3			2
so bad is @entity0 's form that they have the second - worst record of all the league title winners who have made it into the @entity1 this season			1
that means the @entity12 champions have a worse record than @entity14 , the @entity16 league winners , @entity17 of @entity18 , and @entity20 titans @entity19			1
@entity21 ( left ) reflects on another night of misery in the @entity1 for @entity0 @entity23 and @entity0 are facing elimination after crashing to defeat against @entity26 on wednesday @entity0 's latest @entity28 misery came in the form of a home defeat by @entity26 , leaving @entity32 's side bottom of @entity33 and needing a miracle to progress into the knockout stages			1
after four games their record reads : played four , won none , drawn two and lost two , with a total of two points to their name			0
to highlight @entity0 's struggles , @entity42 has created a table based on the results of all last season 's @entity47 title winners so far in the @entity1			1
but this table is inversed , with the worst records sitting top of the league and the best at the bottom			0
this is not the @entity1 - this is the @entity55			0
@entity56 have the best record of all @entity3 's title winners in the @entity1 this season even @entity17 of @entity18 have a better record in this season 's competition than @entity0 only @entity65 , here in action against @entity64 , have a worse record than the @entity12 champions unsurprisingly @entity69 giants @entity56 boast the best record , with @entity72 's team having secured four wins from four games in the @entity1 this season			1
but that means they are bottom of the @entity55			0
city are second , with only @entity65 above them			0
the champions of @entity82 have just one point to their name in this season 's competition			2
it should be stressed that @entity0 can still qualify for the round of 16 in @entity3 's elite competition , but they will need to beat both @entity90 and @entity56 in their final two games to do so			2
so it looks like they might have a better chance of topping the @entity55 this season .			0

@entity0 lost against @entity26 on wednesday night
city are now in *danger* of @entity1 elimination
@entity12 champions have not won a game in this year 's competition
only @entity65 have worse record of all @entity3 's title winners this year
@entity56 have best record , with four wins out of four
@entity42 has created an inverse table : the @entity55
