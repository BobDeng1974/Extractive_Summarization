by @entity0 published : 22:24 est , 7 april 2013 updated : 02:45 est , 8 april 2013 @entity1 , head of the @entity4 union , said there ' definitely ' were discussions about ' generalised strike action ' millions of workers will join the first general strike since 1926 as they send a message to the @entity12 that they will ' not simply accept their lot ' , it has today been reported			1
@entity1 , head of the @entity4 ( @entity3 ) union , which represents the civil service and other government agencies , said there ' definitely ' were discussions about ' generalised strike action '			1
he said unions were co-ordinating in a bid to fight back against cuts to pay , jobs and pensions in the public sector , the @entity19 reports			1
it comes after months of speculation about a general strike , and days after leaked papers from @entity31 's biggest union @entity29 revealed possible plans for a general walkout			1
but mr @entity1 is the first trade union leader to publicly confirm that there were active discussions			0
he told @entity36 ; ' my own opinion is that what the government is doing is getting so increasingly unpopular that even a 24 - hour strike involving millions of people across the economy will be an incredibly important moment			0
' today thousands of @entity46 staff , members of the @entity3 , are expected to take part in a half - day walkout , coinciding with the start of the new tax year			0
the last @entity52 ( 4 - 12 may 1926			0
) city workers crossing @entity54 after walking from their homes owing to the suspension of public transport services a dense stream of private cars passing down the @entity60 during the @entity52 , 1926			0
the workers participating in the general strike included railway workers , dockers and steelworkers @entity31 's previous general strike came in may 1926 following a dispute over reduced wages for coal miners			1
after the miners were locked out from work , the @entity70 called on its 1.7million members to walk out of their jobs in solidarity			0
last - minute negotiations with prime minister @entity78 's government were called off after the @entity80 's printers refused to print an editorial criticising the proposed strike as a ' revolutionary move '			0
the workers participating in the general strike included railway workers , dockers and steelworkers			1
thousands of volunteers and special constables tried to replace the lost labour , and after nine days the @entity70 admitted defeat and called off the action			0
then from 1978 to 1979 , the @entity92 saw a public sector strike under @entity95 's government , which resulted in power cuts and piles of rubbish on streets			1
the strikes , which called for bigger pay rises , had even seen gravediggers join picket lines and leave dead bodies waiting to be buried			0
the @entity3 began a three - month campaign of protest over pay , jobs and conditions on budget day - march 20			2
mr @entity1 warned that the strike today would be followed by further action in @entity112 over the next two months			2
a document drawn up by @entity29 and leaked last week described a general strike as ' desirable '			2
fellow union , @entity115 , which has 1.3million members , said it would back proposals for a general strike as long as it was the end , not the beginning , of a protest campaign			1
the threat of co-ordinated industrial action comes after unions voted overwhelmingly last september to start planning the ‘ practicalities ’ of the first general strike since 1926 at the @entity127			1
the idea was put forward by the @entity129			0
@entity29 , @entity115 and the @entity130 all backed a motion to consider the ' practicalities ' of a general strike			2
but other , less radical , are likely to be opposed to the idea			0
if it goes ahead , a general strike would wipe out vital services , with workers from teachers to prison guards , firemen to nurses , dinner ladies to paramedics likely to walk out			2
a general strike would cause more upheaval than previous protests against the @entity12 as it would encompass both the public and private sector .			1

@entity1 , head of @entity3 union , confirmed strike talks were held
unions ' fighting against cuts to pay , jobs and pensions in public sector '
comes after months of speculation about first general strike in *87* years
