shock : @entity4 received a mobile bill for £ 1,046 , with his operator claiming he made a single phone call lasting nearly two days			1
@entity8 then tried to take the money from his bank account mr @entity4 , a grandfather and retired job centre adviser , said : ‘ i was absolutely shocked			1
when i called @entity8 they said i had made a 43 - hour phone call			1
‘ to do that i would have had to go without sleep for two days , which is obviously ridiculous			0
‘ i asked for the service to be restored but the firm refused			0
’ the problem was caused by a call he made with his @entity8 phone to mobile operator 3 on may 10			1
mr @entity4 , from @entity30 in @entity31 , was checking when the contract on his second phone expired and the call lasted about ten minutes			2
ironically , if he had used his 3 phone to make the call it would have been free			0
@entity38 : mobile phone company @entity8 blocked the 65 - year - old 's phone and even tried to take £ 1,046.26 by direct debit he believes that either he or 3 failed to hang up properly at the end of the brief chat			1
he did n’t use his mobile for another two days , and when he eventually tried there was a message telling him he could not continue			0
mr @entity4 , who has a £ 10 monthly contract which usually covers his needs , said : ‘ i ’m not very good with mobile phones but i could n’t understand how there could possibly be a problem because i never get anywhere near the monthly limit on calls that i am allowed			2
@entity4 says he can go days without using his phone and admits that he is n't much of a talker ‘ i told my son , who used to be a manager with a mobile phone company , and he called @entity8 on my behalf			1
when he said i owed more than £ 1,000 i was shocked			0
' ' he disputed the amount and the company said it would be investigated			0
over the next ten days or so i made several calls to ask how this could be but each time they insisted i owed the money			2
they said it had to be paid			0
’ mr @entity4 checked his bank account online and saw that rather than pausing his direct debit payment while the bill was being investigated , @entity8 was due to take the full amount out			1
he got the payment stopped			0
‘ i pay all my bills on time and i have never been in debt , ’ he said			0
‘ i have asked so many times , “ why would i make such a long call ? ” whenever i spoke to anyone i got sympathy but no action			0
’ his phone log did show a call lasting 43 hours , but he believes there should have been an automatic disconnection			1
as the dispute continued he even got a text stating ‘ we ’re glad we ’ve solved your problem ’ – although his phone was still blocked			0
it took ten days and the intervention of his local newspaper before @entity8 waived the four - figure bill and reconnected his phone			1
he said in the end @entity8 ‘ seemed to accept the logic that i could n’t possibly have been on the phone for that long ’			2
a spokesman for @entity8 described the case as ‘ highly unusual ’ and added : ‘ due to exceptional circumstances we have waived all charges for the call and reconnected the phone			2
