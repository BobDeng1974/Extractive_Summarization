it was branded by @entity1 as ' one of the finest expositions of the @entity5 art of muddling through			1

the £ 3.8billion project will run from @entity13 to @entity14 and eventually link to @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18			1
under the agreement , signed today , @entity6 will finance 90 per cent of the railway while the @entity8 government will foot the rest			1

work was hampered by storms , strikes , local hostility , disease and lion attacks			0
some 2,500 workers , many of them labourers imported from @entity41 , as they toiled in the heat to meet their imperial masters ' ambitious timetable early days : construction of the original line began in @entity14 and the railway reached @entity13 in 1899			1
by december 1901 , it had reached the shore of @entity50 construction work on the standard gauge line is expected to start in october this year , and the 610 km ( 380 - mile ) stretch from the coast to @entity13 is due to be finished in early 2018			1
the deal was signed at @entity56 in @entity13 and witnessed by presidents @entity24 of @entity8 , @entity27 of @entity15 , @entity28 of @entity16 and @entity29 of @entity18 as well as @entity6 prime minister @entity26			1

the aim then was to create a route linking @entity14 to @entity15 , the source of the @entity71 and to open up @entity61 's ' interior ' trouble ahead : but huge costs - both financial and in human life - drew strong opposition and the project soon became known as the ' @entity7 ' man eaters : lt col @entity79 ( pictured with one of the two dead @entity81 ) described how he and his workers became drawn into a dangerous game of cat and mouse with two lions , claiming they ate 135 men before he killed them ' this project demonstrates that there is equal cooperation and mutual benefit between @entity6 and the @entity94 countries , and the railway is a very important part of transport infrastructure development , ' @entity26 said			1
the @entity81 are the most notorious lions in history who terrorised the @entity5 - led team of railway - bridge builders at @entity8 's @entity102 in 1898			1
over a nine - month reign of terror , the two maneless male lions would sneak into the labourers ' camp in the dead of night and snatch men from their tents , devouring them on site			0
terrified workers built snares , thorn fences and bonfires to scare them off but the beasts simply crawled under or leapt over them to reach their prey			2
the number of victims varies wildly between accounts			0
lt. col. @entity79 , who oversaw the project and ultimately killed the beasts , claimed they had slain 135 men , though that number is generally accepted to be a generous exaggeration			2
current estimates remain somewhere between 30 and 70 dead			0
after several attempts to hunt down and kill the lions , @entity79 finally shot one from scaffold on december 9 1898			2
it measured 3m , from head to tail			0
he killed the second 20 days later after shooting it nine times , and recorded the story in his 1907 book @entity138			0
the tale has since been made into three films , most recently the 1996 movie @entity142 , starring @entity143 , as @entity79 , and @entity144			0
after 25 years as @entity79 's floor rugs , the lions ' skins were eventually sold to the @entity148 in 1924 for $ 5,000 where they were stuffed and put on display ( pictured )			0
@entity24 hailed the booming relationship with @entity6 , calling it one ' based on mutual trust ' and saying @entity8 ' has found an honourable partner in @entity6 '			1
construction of the original line began in @entity14 and the railway reached @entity13 in 1899			1
by december 1901 , it had reached the shore of @entity50			0
but building the line proved no easy task for the @entity5			2
the aim then was to create a route linking @entity14 to @entity15 , the source of the @entity71 and to open up @entity61 's ' interior '			2
but huge costs - both financial and in human life - drew strong opposition and the project soon became known as the ' @entity7 '			2
@entity171 and attacks by wild animals killed some 2,500 workers , many of them labourers imported from @entity41 , as they toiled in the heat to meet their imperial masters ' ambitious timetable			1
lt col @entity79 , who oversaw the construction of a railway bridge over the @entity102 in @entity8 in 1898 , described how he and his workers became drawn into a dangerous game of cat and mouse with a local pride of lions			1
' our work was soon interrupted in a rude and startling manner , ' he wrote			0
' two most voracious and insatiable man - eating lions appeared upon the scene and for over nine months waged an intermittent warfare against the railway and all those connected with it in the vicinity of @entity196			0
' one of the lions ' many victims was the unfortunate superintendent @entity199 , who was dragged from his carriage and killed by one of the beasts			0
lt col @entity79 's story was later dramatised in the 1996 movie @entity142 , starring @entity143 , as @entity79 , and @entity144			0
for a brief period , the 660 - mile track proved a success , despite its massive cost , opening up @entity61 's ' interior ' to tradesmen and colonists and transforming the region			0
tellingly , @entity1 , who later shot zebra from the train , called it ' one of the finest expositions of the @entity5 art of muddling through '			1
but over the years it was blighted by bandit raids , corruption and neglect			0
now trains are infrequent and slow , running at little more than around 15mph			0
there have also been numerous derailments and delays in recent years , sparking serious safety fears and a resulting passenger exodus			0
@entity8 economist @entity230 told @entity231 that @entity6 ’s new engagement with @entity61 was ' very similar to the @entity5 engagement in the past : railways , roads , bridges , major infrastructure '			1
with president @entity241 about to face trial for alleged crimes against humanity , @entity8 relations with the @entity240 has become strained			2
@entity5 has reduced its dealings with him to ' essential ' contact only			0
@entity6 , however , has seen @entity8 's alienation from the @entity240 as a gaping opportunity and eagerly stepped in			2
@entity6 car manufacturers and television stations all operate in @entity8 while an @entity253 edition of @entity254 is now printed in the capital , @entity13			1
brief success : for a brief period , the 660 - mile track proved a success , despite its massive cost , opening up @entity61 's ' interior ' to tradesmen and colonists and transforming the region			0
in this picture , @entity266 president @entity265 inspects a train on the track danger : but over the years it was blighted by bandit raids , corruption and neglect			0
now trains are infrequent and slow , running at little more than around 15mph hopes that the new line will boost @entity8 's economy - already running at a healthy 5 per cent growth - and its government claim it will knock some 79 per cent off the cost of running freight across the country			2
but critics say it represents a starkly one - way trade relationship between @entity6 and @entity8			1
@entity8 ’s exports to @entity6 totalled just £ 32 million last year , compared with imports of £ 1.2 billion			1
' @entity24 feels he needs to rebalance towards @entity6 in particular , ' said mr @entity230			2
' it ’s clear why — @entity6 is mr @entity290 , and we need loads of money to leapfrog our infrastructure to modern standards			0
but the president ’s tone and language have been seen as quite dismissive to @entity8 ’s old friends			2

the £ 3.8billion project will run from @entity13 to @entity14 , then other nations
@entity6 @entity26 hails deal as ' very important part of transport development '
@entity8 president @entity24 says deal represents ' honourable partnership '
line was first built by @entity5 colonialists between 1895 and 1901
but construction was costly and dangerous , earning *nickname* ' @entity7 '
some 2,500 workers , mostly from @entity41 , were killed by disease and lions
@entity1 , who shot @entity323 from train , called it ' one of the finest expositions of the @entity5 art of muddling through '
