the @entity1 coverage of @entity4 's @entity3 extravaganzas ca n't seem to take a trick - panned in 2013 as bland and amateurish , the 2014 version signed off with host @entity7 apparently muttering ' oh , thank @entity8 ' as the credits began to roll			1
technical problems interrupted the live broadcast on occasion and , as in the previous year , some jokes were missing their mark			0
but it was when the respected comedian said her goodbyes at the end of the telecast , along with her co-hosts , that she made what appeared to be an exasperated comment , seemingly unaware the audio had not yet been turned off			2
the @entity26 broadcast team prepares to bid farewell to viewers @entity7 blows a kiss to viewers as the broadcast winds up on the @entity1 that 's it then			1
but just seconds after this the comedian was heard to mutter ' oh thank @entity8 ' as the credits began to roll , apparently unaware the audio had not been switched off even though the audio was stopped from the on - set microphones almost immediately , the ' @entity8 ' remark sent social media into a spin			1
some tweeters even suggesting the gaffe was their favourite moment of the coverage			0
others suggesting the time between the early fireworks and the midnight show seemed to drag on longer than the entire year itself			0
social media launched into action as soon as the audio spill occurred - some suggesting it was the moment of the coverage most social media users found ms @entity7 's slip humorous and came to her defence in a boost for the @entity1 however , the coverage was well - watched			2
a total national audience approaching 1.9 million viewers was reported , with the capital city audience rating 1.37 million			1
last year 's version copped a pasting by critics , some suggesting it had been a ' train wreck ' , amid other claims it was at times inappropriate and sexist			0
this year 's show also out - rated the 2013 broadcast			0
tweets about the overall coverage were not very flattering but the @entity1 coverage did out - rate the previous year 's highly controversial show definitely not a fan here			0
but in a boost for @entity1 bosses , the broadcast did draw a total national audience of almost 1.9 million opinions on the hosts and the coverage differed across the board , with most viewers criticising at least one aspect			1

*embarrassment* for @entity26 coverage again as host is caught out by open microphone at end of broadcast
comedian @entity7 appeared to utter ' oh thank @entity8 ' as the credits rolled
there were *plenty* of critics again over national broadcaster 's coverage of the *big* event
