a 1,400 - year old mass grave of decapitated prisoners of war has been discovered in the @entity4 city of @entity5 in @entity6			1
the 7th - century grave contained dismembered skeletons of 24 victims , thought to have been prisoners of war , in what was once a water reservoir			1
the finding provides the first physical evidence that the violent murder of opponents , which was so often shown in @entity18 , was in fact practiced			1
scientists from the @entity21 discover the remains of dismembered human bodies in an artificial cave in the @entity26 city @entity5 in @entity6			2
the image shows the artificial cave 's interior during the excavations with several skulls , lower jaws and ribs ‘ it is absolutely rare to find such a mass grave in the @entity40 area , ’ @entity34 , who discovered the mass grave , told @entity36			2
‘ the only other archaeological evidence of such a dismemberment of victims was in the site of @entity45 , @entity46			1
’ due to being covered by clay , the bones were so well - preserved that it was possible to distinguish the age and sex of 15 of the 24 individuals			1
they included 13 men and two women who were aged from 18 to 42 at the time of their death			0
the mass grave was found in what was once a water reservoir			2
the light grey surfaces around the entrance is an impermeable stucco floor , which was destined to catch runoff and divert it into the interior of the reservoir analysis of teeth and bones showed that several of the deceased suffered from malnutrition and had lost several teeth to tooth decay			0
some of the dead had tooth inserts of jade			1
the scientists interpreted this as a sign of high social status			1
the bones also provided clues about how each victim met their violent death			0
‘ i observed complete legs , whose bones were still in the correct anatomical articulation from the hip , to the femur , the kneecaps until the smallest toe - bones , ’ said mr @entity34			0
‘ apart from that , i also observed other detached body parts such as severed heads , complete hands , detached feet			0
’ the image shows the left side of another individual 's skull whose upper part has been entirely chopped off			0
the fine nature of the breaking edge shows that the destruction of this skull did not occurr after its deposition some of the dead had tooth inserts of jade			1
the scientists interpret this as a sign of high social status after cleaning the bones , mr @entity34 found traces of the violent killing , such as blunt force trauma on the foreheads and traces of sharp blades , which had cut away parts of skulls and had severed the heads			1
‘ this observation excluded the possibility that this mass grave was a so - called secondary burial , in which the bones of the deceased are placed at a new location ’ , he said			2
archaeologists from the @entity132 had been excavating in the historical @entity133 of @entity5 in @entity134 for the past five years to uncover the origins and the collapse of regional states in the @entity40 lowlands			0
the image shows the bones of a complete foot , during the excavation			0
it shows how all the bones are still in the anatomical natural state , which means that the foot was severed from the rest of the body and was then immediately buried on the location where it was documented sculpture from the late @entity4 period depicts the sacrificial rites of an ancient ball game , at the end of which the captain of the losing team would be ritually decapitated the researchers do not yet know whether they are prisoners of war from another @entity4 city or were sacrificed in @entity5 or nobles from @entity5 itself			2
mr @entity34 is yet to excavate the western half of the water reservoir , and is hopeful more artefacts will be found			0
the project was headed by dr @entity166 and dr @entity167 from the @entity21 , as well as dr @entity168 from the @entity169 .			0
