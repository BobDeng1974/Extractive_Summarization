the @entity9 striker signed for the @entity10 on deadline day for £ 16million from @entity12 and has struggled in front of goal during his first two outings for the club			1
@entity2 hit the post during the draw against @entity19 on saturday and might 've found the net against @entity21 in the @entity22			1
@entity2 lies on the turf as he watches the ball go wide of @entity21 goalkeeper @entity25 @entity2 collapsed to his knees after missing @entity4 's best chance of the first half in @entity29 @entity2 stumbles at the back post under pressure and misses a chance to give @entity4 the lead @entity2 could only hit the post when put in the clear against @entity19 at the @entity35 on saturday @entity5 's side were soundly beaten in @entity29 , but would have gone ahead had the 23 - year - old not fluffed his lines when one - on - one with @entity25			1
