@entity0 has been left scratching his head by @entity3 's pre-season form but one shining ray of light has been the emergence of 19 - year - old striker @entity6			1
@entity3 's manager is not afraid to give youth its chance and , in @entity6 , he feels there is a young man who could become the latest distinguished graduate from the club 's thriving @entity13			1
@entity16 's @entity15 discusses the youngster 's upbringing and assesses his chances of making a first team impact next season			2
that was abundantly clear on sunday in @entity30 against @entity32 side @entity31 , when he scored @entity3 's only goal in a 3 - 1 defeat			1
it was a thumping effort , too			0
after collecting a pass from @entity39 , he dragged the ball away from his marker before crashing a curling , right - footed drive that sped into the net			0
it was a strike reminiscent of some from @entity3 's first team coach , @entity46			1
does he have a chance of starting the season then ? well , @entity0 was certainly enthusiastic about how he has coped with being in the first team environment and believes he is ' pushing ' to be included			2
given that there are fitness issues concerning @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 , there is every reason to think that he could feature in the party that travels to the @entity58 on saturday			0
back of the net : @entity6 opens the scoring for @entity3 against @entity31 in a pre-season friendly instant impact : @entity6 runs to celebrate his goal with veteran midfielder @entity64 how long has he been at @entity3 ? all his life			1
he first set foot in the club 's @entity13 14 years ago when he was just 5			0
he has stood out in recent years thanks to his speed , composure and agility			0
he has represented @entity3 at all age - groups , signed his first professional contract in july 2013 and has played for @entity74 at @entity75 , u- 17 , u- 18 and @entity77 level			1
he also had a brief loan spell at @entity79 last season , scoring once in four appearances			2
@entity3 pride themselves on producing good , young players , do n't they ? with good reason			2
@entity6 – who bases his game on former @entity74 striker @entity86 – is not much younger than @entity87 and @entity88 and he went to the @entity90 - 20 @entity89 , which was staged in @entity91 last summer , with those two			1
if he makes the anticipated progress , he one day could be tied down to a long - term contract and be part of the future @entity0 is building for the club			0
homegrown : @entity6 joined @entity3 's academy at the age of five and has represented @entity74 at @entity90 level in the frame : @entity6 could make @entity3 's squad for their opening @entity103 game against @entity104 what has he made of the big change ? as you can imagine , @entity6 has embraced the extra responsibility , saying : ' i 've loved being with the first - team for the last two months			1
i was with the under - 21s for a week in pre-season and then the gaffer told me i was going to be with them			0
i 've taken it in my stride and i 'm loving it			0

@entity6 scored in @entity3 's 3 - 1 friendly defeat to @entity31 in @entity30
he has a chance of making the @entity3 squad to face @entity104 on saturday
the 19 - year - old joined @entity3 at the age of five
he spent part of last season on loan at @entity131 @entity79
@entity6 has represented @entity74 at @entity133 , 17 , 18 and 20 level
