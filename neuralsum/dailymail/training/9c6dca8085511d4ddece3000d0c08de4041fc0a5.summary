by @entity1 reporter most parents these days are no strangers to snapping endless photos of their newborns but we 'd hazard a guess that they 'd love a few more snaps of them sleeping - not least because we all know a sleeping baby can be a rare thing			1
and of course a sleeping baby can also be a very cute thing , as these adorable pictures show , especially within the first two weeks of their life when they are at their most teeny and delicate			2
because tiny babies have much more soft cartilage in their bones at first , they are still comfortable curling themselves into comfy , and very heart - string - pulling positions to be photographed while they have a little snooze			2
sleeping beauty : @entity22 has released this series of pictures of sleeping babies proud father : a man kisses the head of his sleeping newborn baby in this intimate series pf photographs so sweet : during the first two weeks of a baby 's life they around 300 soft cartilage bones and are more comfortable getting into sleeping positions like this cute cook : @entity22 , who took these pictures , say the first 14 days of a new - born 's life are their most delicate these beautiful pictures show sleeping babies that they have captured on camera within two weeks of being born			1
during this time of their brand new lives , a baby has around 300 soft cartilage bones			2
as they grow , these fuse together to make 206 bones			0
as they have more of these soft cartilage bones in their first two weeks they are more comfortable to sleep with their legs tucked under their bottoms , mimicking the positions they took in the womb			0
these compacted positions are very unique to the first 14 days , as after this period they get used to stretching out while sleeping in their cribs			1
cool : @entity64 , a baby has around 300 soft cartilage bones when they are born and , as they grow , these fuse together to make 206 bones double trouble : parents should photograph babies with two weeks of them being born to capture their true delicacy , says venture all the images taken were from proud parents bringing in their new - borns to venture studios across the @entity79 so they could capture their first two weeks of life kiss from above : the first 14 days of a baby 's life are also their most peaceful , therefore experts are able to take a great range of shots without making your baby uncomfortable ‘ they no longer adopt the unique foetal positions showing how important it is to capture this limited moment in your baby ’s life , ’ says @entity89 , creative director of venture photography			1
‘ we know how important those moments are			0
' just seeing the change in images people take with their smart phones over the weeks , it is clear how much your baby will grow and develop			0
’ all the images taken were from proud parents bringing in their new - borns to venture studios across the @entity79 so they could capture their first two weeks of life .			0

in their first 14 days , babies are most delicate
they are able to mimic foetal position easily because bones are softer
@entity22 have captured two - week old babies sleeping
be careful *ladies* , your wombs might *explode* *...* .
