by @entity0 a new instant tanning spray promoted with images of a naked @entity3 lounging beside a pool is being secretly withdrawn because of safety fears			1
the company behind cans of @entity8 has issued a confidential safety recall to high street and online stores			1
the problem is related to reports of breathing problems among women customers who accidentally inhaled the spray when using it			1
the product was promoted with images of a naked @entity3 lounging beside a pool ( above ) the product was launched only weeks ago , while it featured at @entity28 where it was used in catwalk shows by the likes of @entity32			0
however , a leaked warning from the @entity35 executive director of the @entity37 brand , @entity34 , says spray can versions of the product should be withdrawn from sale with immediate effect			1
the memo reads : ‘ the objective of this communication is to implement a withdrawal of product from retailer warehouse and shelves and to cease selling online			1
’ it adds : ‘ we have recently been made aware of a small number of isolated adverse reactions to the newly launched @entity53 ( 100ml ) in light / medium and medium / dark			0
‘ as a result , we have decided to withdraw the product from our customers ’ warehouses and on - shelves with immediate effect			1
‘ we are currently reviewing the composition of the product and conducting a full risk assessment			0
' as a precautionary measure , please also remove these two products from online sales			1
’ the problem with the product is not spelt out in the warning to retailers , however a clue is offered in a hard - to - find safety recall notice on the firm ’s website			1
this states : ‘ we have recently been made aware that a very small number of customers have experienced inhalation issues with the newly launched cosmetic product , @entity78 … when used under certain circumstances			1
’ it advises customers to return it to their retailer to claim a full refund of the £ 10 purchase price			1
the recall is highly damaging to the @entity37 brand , which is owned by @entity88 and a fortune was spent on launching the instant tanning range in september			1
@entity3 was central to the launch with photo - shoots and a video on the @entity95 website heralding the new instant tanning product			0
speaking on behalf of the company , the 39 - year - old , said : ‘ @entity95 is a trustworthy brand and people know it			2
' it 's a natural looking tan			0
that ’s what people want , they do n't want something orange and it is really easy to apply yourself			0
‘ when i 've got a tan , it definitely helps with confidence			0
’ she added : ‘ @entity95 do it so well now			0
they do look natural you do n't have to fear that they go streaky and not being able to get it off			0
’ speaking on behalf of the company , @entity3 , 39 , said : ' @entity95 is a trustworthy brand and people know it			2
it 's a natural looking tan			0
that 's what people want , they do n't want something orange and it is really easy to apply yourself ' the problem with the product appears limited to the spray can version , rather than the lotion form of the product which is just rubbed into the skin			2
when launching the product , the company boasted that the formula contains @entity137 technology with silicon - coated pigments , which prevents them from streaking or running			2
it said this formula ensures that the colour does not run or rub off			0
@entity143 , of @entity144 , said the law around product safety withdrawals is a grey area			2
currently , regulations state that firms must do ‘ everything practical ’ to alert consumers , however there is no official guidance as to what this means in practice			0
often , companies run advertisements in newspapers - but that has not happened with the @entity95 product			0
@entity95 said it has asked retailers to alert customers by putting up posters in stores			1
@entity166 , the chief executive of @entity167 , said : ‘ @entity95 has recently been made aware that a very small number of our customers have experienced inhalation issues			1
‘ when concerns are raised about any of our products , we adopt a responsible and proactive approach			0
any customers who have purchased the product can return it to their point of purchase for a full refund			2
’ she stressed that other products in the range are not affected and apologised to customers for any inconvenience .			2
