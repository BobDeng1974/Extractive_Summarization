by @entity1 reporter middle - aged people who do n’t get enough exposure to sunshine are twice as likely to die earlier , research warns			0
around half of all adults in the @entity8 are thought to have some degree of vitamin d deficiency			1
but scientists from the @entity13 ’s @entity12 found that people with an average age of 55 who had lower blood levels of vitamin d were twice as likely to die prematurely as those with higher levels			1
people with over 55 who had who had lower blood levels of vitamin d were twice as likely to die prematurely , research from the @entity13 suggests ( library image ) @entity24 is made by the body under the skin when it is exposed to sunlight			1
a deficiency can cause problems when there is not enough of the vitamin to properly absorb the required levels of calcium and phosphate			1
mild to moderate vitamin d deficiency can lead to bone pain and weakening of the bones – osteoporosis – which increases the risk of fractures			2
more severe levels of deficiency can lead to the development of rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults			1
and a 2010 @entity52 clinical review found that vitamin d deficiency can increase the risk of developing heart disease , bowel and breast cancer , multiple sclerosis and diabetes			2
professor @entity60 said : ' three years ago , the @entity61 concluded that having a too - low blood level of vitamin d was hazardous			2
' this study supports that conclusion , but goes one step further			0
' the 20 nanograms per milliliter ( ng / ml ) blood level cutoff assumed from the @entity61 report was based solely on the association of low vitamin d with risk of bone disease			0
' this new finding is based on the association of low vitamin d with risk of premature death from all causes , not just bone diseases			0
” prof @entity60 said the blood level amount of vitamin d associated with about half of the death rate was 30 ng / ml. sun - lovers : half of @entity8 adults have a vitamin d deficiency - which is created by the body under the skin when it is expose to sunlight ( library image ) two - thirds of the @entity91 population has an estimated blood vitamin d level below 30 ng / ml. prof @entity93 added : ' this study should give the medical community and public substantial reassurance that vitamin d is safe when used in appropriate doses up to 4,000 @entity99 ( @entity99 ) per day			1
' however , it ’s always wise to consult your physician when changing your intake of vitamin d and to have your blood level of 25 - hydroxyvitamin @entity24 checked annually			2
' @entity1 intakes above 4,000 @entity99 per day may be appropriate for some patients under medical supervision			0
' the study published in the @entity108 reported the average age when the blood was drawn was 55 years with the average length of follow - up was nine years			0
it involved 566,583 people from 14 countries .			0

half of @entity8 adults have some degree of vitamin d deficiency , data shows
over *55s* with low levels of vitamin d twice as likely to die prematurely
