items on sale in @entity3 are sometimes up to 50 per cent more expensive than those sold in supermarkets , new research has shown			1
the budget retailer last week announced that sales exceed £ 1billion for the first time last year becoming @entity10 's largest single - price discount retailer			1
the company 's success has been put down to shoppers hunting bargains and taking sales away from @entity17 's four big supermarkets , @entity16 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20			1
the research points out that at @entity3 shoppers can buy a 250g box of @entity34 for £ 1 , while at @entity18 they can buy a 750g box of the cereal for the same price			1
a bag of @entity39 with a weight of 105g also costs £ 1 in the shop but a bigger bag at at 153g can be purchased in @entity16 for 98p			0
equally two pints of mile cost £ 1 in @entity3 , but shoppers can get four pints in @entity16 for 89p			1
also a pack of six @entity46 is 81p in @entity18 , compared to £ 1 in the budget brand			0
originally founded by entrepreneur @entity49 in 1990 , the company snowballed from a small private enterprise into a @entity52 revolution , which involves buying up unwanted stock and end - of - lines , then swiftly getting them into the shops to sell cheaply			0
however , the research does point out that there are still many products cheaper at @entity3 compared to other supermarkets			1
these include a @entity63 steak and kidney pie , which is £ 2.20 in @entity19 's and a 24 pack of @entity66 , which are £ 2.29 in @entity18			2
however , a spokesman for @entity3 told the newspaper : ' we conduct price surveys every two weeks against the supermarkets and we believe we are 40 % cheaper or more against 1,000 branded products			1
comparing either supermarket promotions or larger pack sizes with our prices is not a meaningful comparison			0
@entity3 has snowballed from a small private enterprise into a @entity52 revolution , which involves buying up unwanted stock and end - of - lines ( file picture ) ' promotions are temporary and with larger pack sizes you have to spend much more to get any better value			2
on a like - for - like comparison @entity3 ’s value , across our whole range , is compelling			2
' the company 's discounting strategy has since been adopted by bargain chains such as @entity91 and @entity92 , all of which have eaten into a market once dominated by the supermarket chains such as @entity96 , @entity18 and @entity19 's			0
back then , shoppers were beginning to desert the @entity52 for superstores , but mr @entity49 and his @entity3 chain - which he sold in 2000 for £ 50million - were a lifeline that helped keep it afloat			1
@entity3 said it had opened 60 new stores in the @entity17 and @entity104 and had a strong pipeline of openings for the new year			2
meanwhile the retailer warned on friday it may walk away from its planned £ 55 million acquisition of rival 99p stores rather than be subject to a lengthy probe by the @entity17 competition watchdog			0
@entity17 's @entity112 ( @entity113 ) said last week the agreed deal could result in a substantial lessening of competition and would be subject to a further investigation in the absense of undertakings , such as selling some stores			0
the company said in a statement : ' @entity3 has decided not to offer remedies to the @entity113 ' , adding it had written to the regulator to request a @entity126 review be suspended for three weeks			0
such a review could take as long as six months .			0

certain products at retailer are more expensive per unit than supermarkets
comes as @entity3 announced sales exceed £ *1bn* for first time last year
@entity138 's success has been put down to shoppers hunting for bargains
