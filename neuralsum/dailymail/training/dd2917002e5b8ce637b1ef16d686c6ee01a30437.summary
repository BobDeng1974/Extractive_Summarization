more than 500 refugees from @entity2 's bloody civil war have already been resettled in the @entity3 , and @entity3 officials and members of @entity6 are becoming increasingly worried that jihadis linked to the @entity9 terror army could slip into the country along with them			1
since war broke out in @entity2 nearly four years ago , @entity3 has welcomed 524 people from the rapidly disintegrating country with open arms			1
@entity3 intelligence agencies lack the resources to vet them properly , but the @entity19 administration plans to admit a few thousand more this year			1
' the @entity3 has admitted 524 @entity2 since 2011 , ' @entity21 spokeswoman @entity20 told reporters on feb. 13			1
' we 're likely to admit 1,000 to 2,000 @entity2 refugees for permanent resettlement in @entity26 2015 and a somewhat higher number , though still in the low thousands , in @entity26 2016			1
' the @entity49 ultimately makes the decisions			0
the idea that @entity53 terrorists could use @entity3 's generous asylum system to bring their @entity55 to the @entity3 has set off a frenzy of complaints that the @entity3 lacks the ability and resources to properly screen every @entity2 who seeks safe haven from the @entity63 regime			1
' it 's clearly a population of concern , ' @entity65 director @entity64 told the @entity42 on feb. 11			0
@entity70 assistant director @entity69 said friday that there 's a lack of reliable information on the ground about the @entity2 applying to get into the @entity3 @entity42 chairman @entity41 , a @entity76 @entity75 , replied that it would be a ' huge mistake ' to resettle more @entity2 in the @entity3 @entity80 estimates suggest that as many as 4 million people have already fled @entity2 ; another 7 million remain in the country but have been forced to leave their homes			1
the @entity9 army , a self - proclaimed ' @entity85 , ' is based in the @entity2 city of @entity87			1
its reign of brutality has included mass executions , countless war crimes and the routine sexual abuse of women taken as ' wives ' from conquered territory in @entity2 and @entity97			2
@entity99 spokesman @entity98 told @entity100 in january that screening protocols for refugees ' are rigorous , continually refined , and build on years of experience vetting individuals coming to the @entity3 from around the world			2
' ' they permit us to proceed in a way that seeks to both safeguard public safety and serve our mission of providing refuge to some of the world 's most vulnerable people			0
' but vetting is only possible if intelligence agencies have reliable information about the petitioners , who are usually referred by the @entity80 high commissioner for refugees			2
@entity3 has received hundres of refugees like these people fleeing to @entity124 @entity2 refugees are ' clearly a population of concern , ' @entity65 director @entity64 told the @entity42 on feb. 11 @entity70 assistant director @entity69 told the @entity49 panel that unlike cases in @entity97 , where the @entity3 has had a presence for more than a decade , @entity2 ' applications are rarely accompanied by robust information about the petitioners			0
there 's ' a lack of information ' about many of them , @entity69 admitted			0
' the difference is , in @entity97 we were there on the ground collecting [ intelligence ] , so we had databases to use			0
' but ' the lack of our footprint on the ground in @entity2 , ' he said , means that ' the databases wo n't have the information we need			2
you are talking about a country that is a failed state , that does not have any infrastructure so to speak			0
' ' so all the data sets , the police , the intel services , that you would normally go to and seek that information , do nâ€™t exist			0

members of @entity6 are suggesting it 's *unwise* to let @entity2 into the country , but 524 have come in already
@entity21 plans to admit thousands more in the coming years
reliable intelligence and databases do n't exist in @entity2 , making it difficult if not *impossible* to thoroughly vet each asylum applicant
the @entity9 terror army is based in @entity2 and has *vowed* to take its @entity55 to @entity172 and beyond
