by @entity0 in @entity1 starting young : research has suggested children who eat more sugary foods are more likely to have stressful lives children as young as five seek solace in food when anxious and stressed , a study has found			1
although some adults are well - known to be emotional eaters , the research shows that the seeds are sown at a very young age			0
rows at home , bullying and illness all drive youngsters to reach for unhealthy , sugar - filled snacks , an obesity conference heard			1
@entity24 researchers asked more than 300 children , aged between five and ten , questions about their lives			1
topics covered included whether they had experienced stressful life events , such as the divorce of their parents or the death of a grandparent , and how angry , anxious , sad and happy they felt			1
bullying , problems with friends and rows with brothers and sisters were also factored in and parents answered questions about their children ’s behaviour			1
the parents also filled in a questionnaire about how often their children ate various foods , while the youngsters explained when they felt driven to eat particular foods			2
the results showed that the more stressful a child ’s life , the more sweet foods they ate			1
girls were particularly prone to comfort eat and to give into temptation when times were tough , the @entity54 on @entity55 in @entity1 , @entity56 , heard			2
it is feared the children will take even more solace in food as they get older and are able to buy and prepare it themselves			2
researcher @entity66 , of @entity67 , also showed that levels of the hormone cortisol rose with stress			0
she thinks this may stop the body reaction to leptin , a hormone that normally tells our body when it has had enough to eat			0
dr @entity66 said that that parents and schools should teach children who to cope with life ’s ups and downs			2
she said : ‘ parents and children should be made aware that stress can influence emotional eating behaviour , so they can pay attention to potential triggers and anticipate this behaviour			2
‘ furthermore , children should be equipped with stress - coping skills , such as problem - solving or asking for help , instead of seeking solace in food			0
’ others said that parents should be aware that they are role models			0
@entity98 of the @entity99 , said : ‘ from the moment that an infant is born it learns that sweetness brings comfort			0
it should therefore be of no surprise that it is sophisticated enough , even by age five , to know that it ’ll feel better about some unhappy event having eaten a chocolate biscuit or something sugary			0
habit : experts warned that children learn comfort eating behaviour from their parents ‘ after all , that ’s what mummy does and parents are role models and copied			1
‘ @entity123 , of course , should know better but most five year olds olds will lack the knowledge that indulgence food can be bad for you , and be habit forming , if not eaten in moderation			0
‘ there ’s nothing wrong with the occasional sweet treat - but that ’s a far cry from comfort eating to relieve stress			1
’ one in ten children aged four to five in @entity136 is obese			1
by the time they are ten or 11 , the figure has doubled			0
children who eat a @entity145 diet at home are 15 per cent less likely to be obese than others , a study of eight @entity142 countries found			1
meals rich in fruit , vegetables , nuts , oily fish and olive oil kept weight down irrespective of age , gender and socio - economic status , in @entity158 , @entity145 - like meals were more common in @entity160 than in @entity161 , the @entity162 researchers said .			0

@entity165 found rows at home , illness and bullying prompt comfort eating
@entity24 researchers *quizzed* 300 children , aged five to ten , on their habits
results found the more stressful a child *'s* life , the more sweet food they eat
