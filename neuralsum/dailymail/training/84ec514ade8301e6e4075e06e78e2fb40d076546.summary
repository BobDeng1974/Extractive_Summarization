their path has never run smooth			1
@entity3 , from @entity43 in the @entity44 is the primary breadwinner after @entity46 was injured in a motorbike accident four years ago			1

infatuated : the couple married in 2007 in a secret civil ceremony @entity3 said : ' in a way , we ’ve proven the whole world wrong			1
it seemed like everyone was against us , purely because of the difference in our ages			1
' i knew when we got together @entity46 was the man i wanted to be with			2
people said i was too young to know that , but i did			2
' and the proof is in the pudding			2
we ’re still very much in love			2
not everything is easy , but that ’s life			2
' i ca n’t wait to have kids - i would have them tomorrow			2
but with @entity46 not working , money is tight , so he says we should wait a while			2
' and @entity46 is about to become a grandfather - he ’s already had his children and is conscious about our money situation			2
' but @entity46 is not getting any younger			2
it ’s crazy to think i am going to be a grandmother soon			2
i ’m excited , but there ’s no way anyone is going to call me @entity79			2
' five years after their marriage @entity3 ’s mum , @entity80 , 46 , has finally come to terms with having a son - in - law who is nine years her senior			1

' i still ca n’t talk to my dad about it and do n’t see him very often			0
' i ’ve got virtually no friends left who are my own age because i felt i could never talk to them about me and @entity92 ' my relationship is good with @entity46 ’s daughter now but obviously it was strained at first			0
' i do n’t treat her as a step daughter and she does n’t treat me like a step mum			0
starting a family : @entity3 says she would like babies , but @entity46 , who is about to become a grandfather , is more reluctant ' despite the massive age gap @entity46 and i are soulmates			1
occasionally it will be an issue like when we are mistaken for father and daughter , which can be a bit embarrassing			0
' or sometimes @entity46 will want me to come home early when i want to stay out later			0
but we are best friends who always know what the other one is thinking			0
' @entity121 was playing guitar in the church orchestra when she was approached by @entity92 despite being warned by her parents and church leaders that the friendship was ‘ inappropriate ’ , the pair continued to meet			0
a year later they moved in together while @entity3 ’s mum was away for the weekend			1
@entity3 said : ' we got a van and moved all my stuff into @entity46 ’s flat			1
my parents were n’t listening when i told them how i felt			0
no regrets : @entity135 , 54 , and @entity3 , now 23 , devastated @entity3 's family when they married five years ago , but today say they are blissfully happy ' i could n’t believe they were being so narrow - minded			1
i knew @entity46 was the man for me			0
' a year later , in 2006 , the slim brunette - who still gets asked to prove her age when buying a lottery ticket - married @entity46 in a secret ceremony attended by only @entity46 ’s family			1
she said : ' we got married at the registry office			0
i felt sad that my family could n’t be there but i knew what i was doing			0
' i do n’t know how she found out but i got a text from my mum after the ceremony asking if i had just got married			1
' i texted back ' yes ' , then i did n’t hear from her for months			0
even if it meant losing my family i knew i had to be with @entity92 after my parents stopped talking to me i still had no regrets			0
' we ’ve already made it five years			0
these days , there are plenty of marriages that do n’t last that long , even when both people are the same age			0
' @entity46 receives £ 300 per month in incapacity benefit after being forced from his job as a car salesman following a bad motorbike accident			0
however , the couple are still able to pursue their love of biking and go out most weekends			1

' it took @entity46 a bit of getting used to			0
we would like to have more money , but we ’re happy for now			0
' we both know @entity46 is likely to die before me but we ’ll cross that bridge when we come to it			0
