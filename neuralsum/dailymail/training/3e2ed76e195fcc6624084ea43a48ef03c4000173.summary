a young woman is taking the taxidermy craze to the next level ... by making stuffed animals wearable			1
@entity4 , 31 , spends her spare time turning rabbits , mice and birds into hats and handbags			1
now she ’s making a living from the wacky accessories and has even had orders from brides hoping to walk down the aisle in one of her creations			1
while it might seem strange to some to have stuffed roadkill perched on your shoulder in a tiny top hat , for some it is the new frontier of fashion the unusual creations like a raven feathered hat ( left ) and a winged mouse hair clip ( right ) are created by @entity4 in her studio in @entity30 , @entity31 from the tiny studio in her flat in @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity4 cleans between the spines of hedgehogs and prepares birds of all shapes and sizes to make them into exotic headgear			1
as part of her attempt to keep her work ethical , the majority of her ‘ subjects ’ are roadkill - commonly found @entity46 animals like foxes and squirrels that have met an untimely death thanks to traffic			2
but it ’s not a quick and easy job - to make a hat can take over a week			2
this includes the man hours , the tanning process and the drying out time necessary to complete a fancy hat or stole			2
far from being reserved for bereaved pet lovers and crazy celebrities , @entity4 now has commissions from the most unlikely of clientele : brides to be			1
each piece requires hours of painstaking work to create , often taking over a week to finish @entity4 started collecting taxidermy years before attempting it herself , progressing from mice to large creatures after floating the idea that a stuffed creature could add that unique twist every couple is looking for , @entity4 has become a hit at wedding fairs			1
she has made headpieces from birds and buttonholes from furs			2
one bride has asked her to make her a handbag for the day of her wedding from a cat			1
even grooms are getting in on the act - she recently completed a necklace made from a raven skull , alongside a whole stuffed raven , for one male customer			1
despite working in marketing , @entity4 is hoping to take her taxidermy full - time as soon as she gets the chance			1
@entity4 said : ' as a child i spent lots of my time pressed up against the glass at museums looking at stuffed animals			1
a taxidermy hat or head piece can require days of tanning and drying out on top of the hours of craftsmanship surprisingly @entity4 's work has caused her to become a favorite at wedding fairs , as couples search for that ' something different ' for their big day ' i ’d always been a little macabre but about four years ago i started collecting taxidermy properly			1
' i lived in @entity112 for a couple of years and when i came back i decided to give it a go myself			0
' i just bought a frozen mouse from the vet and tried it out			0
' i joined the @entity118 guild of taxidermists after that and it ’s been growing since then			0
' last year i set up commercially and it ’s really taken off			2
@entity4 hopes the success of her business means she will soon be able to do taxidermy full time most pieces are made from roadkill - commonly found @entity46 animals like foxes and squirrels that have met an untimely death thanks to traffic ' because of the massive resurgence in interest in taxidermy my work is in demand			1
' but it ’s much more difficult than it looks			0
people who do a three - hour mouse stuffing class and think that they ’ll be able to go off and do it at home are mistaken			0
it takes a lot of training			0
' the results of my first mouse were pretty terrible but it ’s a life - long learning experience			0
' if there ’s something really tricky i have to keep putting it back in the freezer to give my brain a break			0
' now i specialise in wearable taxidermy			2
it ’s mainly a lot of hats but i do all sorts of things			0
but i try to keep it ethical by mainly using roadkill			0
' the reaction has been pretty mixed : some people think it ’s wonderful and are desperate to order			0
' others think it ’s disgusting or just ca n’t see how it will fit into their special day , let alone their own wardrobe			0
