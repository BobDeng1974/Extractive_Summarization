by @entity0 a former lead detective in the @entity3 murder investigation has been accused of telling ' blatant lies ' to incriminate the athlete			1
in his closing arguments at the murder trial , the @entity7 's lawyer @entity6 claimed @entity10 had given contradictory evidence at the runner 's bail hearing last year			1
mr @entity6 also attacked the prosecution for not calling the disgraced police officer to give evidence			0
mr @entity10 quit the investigation after it was revealed he was facing manslaughter charges in a separate case			0
@entity3 leaves court after the first day of closing arguments by the defence and prosecution earlier , chief prosecutor @entity24 used his closing arguments to accuse of @entity3 of repeatedly lying during his testimony in a crude attempt to defend the murder charge			0
alluding to his career as a track star , mr @entity24 the athlete had ' dropped the baton of truth '			1
mr @entity24 cited flaws in the defense , saying the @entity7 's legal team floated more than one theory about what happened on the night that @entity3 shot @entity39 through a closed toilet door in his home			1
defense lawyers had argued that @entity3 fired in self - defense , fearing an intruder , mr @entity24 said , but they also raised the possibility that he was not criminally responsible and accidentally shot because he was ' startled			1
' ' it 's two defenses that you can never reconcile , ' mr @entity24 said as @entity3 sat behind him in the dock , occasionally flicking through documents			1
stressed : @entity3 reacts as he listens to the state prosecutor summarising evidence yesterday @entity53 : @entity3 takes notes during the closing arguments from the prosecution in his murder trial the amputee appeared calm in contrast to past occasions when he vomited and wailed in the dock the once - celebrated double - amputee appeared calm , in contrast on past occasions during which he retched , vomited and wailed in the dock in apparent distress			1
the prosecution has argued that @entity3 intentionally shot @entity39 before dawn on @entity68 last year after a fierce row and claimed he knew she was in the bathroom			1
mr @entity24 ended his closing argument by saying @entity3 was guilty of pre-meditated murder because he then ' made up his mind ' to find his gun , walk through to the bathroom and shoot			0
' that , my lady , is pre-planning , ' @entity76 said to the judge			0
deliberation : @entity3 speaks with a member of his legal team ahead of the final arguments of his murder trial yet mr @entity24 said @entity3 should still be convicted of murder even if the court accepts he did not know it was @entity39 in the toilet cubicle , arguing the athlete intentionally shot at and killed a person with no reason to believe his life was under threat			1
@entity6 , the chief defense lawyer , listened and checked files as mr @entity24 spoke for hours			0
mr @entity24 was occasionally questioned by judge @entity95 and urged to speed up elaborations on written arguments of more than 100 pages that were submitted to the court last week			0
mr @entity6 began his final arguments before @entity95 postponed proceedings until friday for the defense to finish			0
@entity95 will then adjourn the trial to deliberate with two legal assistants on a verdict			2
tense : @entity3 arrives at court in @entity107 to hear the closing arguments in his murder trial @entity3 faces 25 years to life in prison if convicted on the main charge of premeditated murder			1
mr @entity6 noted that some of the evidence at the scene , which @entity76 referred to , had been moved around by investigators			0
' we 're not talking about a conspiracy , ' @entity6 said , calling it unintentional tampering			0
mr @entity6 also noted that @entity10 , the former chief investigating officer in the case , had acknowledged mistakes in police procedure but was not called by the state as a trial witness			2
according to mr @entity24 , @entity3 was vague in allegations that police had possibly tampered with evidence around the scene of the shooting , including fans and a bed cover strewn on the floor of his bedroom			2
it was also improbable that the athlete , in his version , rushed with his gun to investigate a purported sound in the bathroom without first trying to talk to @entity145 and confirm that she was safe , the prosecutor said			2
strain : @entity39 's father , @entity147 ( second left ) arrives at court with wife june ( second right ) for the first time in the trial ' we can not argue that he was the worst witness ever , that honour belongs to someone else , ' said the prosecution 's written argument			1
' the accused was , however , demonstrably one of the worst witnesses ever encountered			0
' the prosecution said @entity3 also ' used well - calculated and rehearsed emotional outbursts to deflect the attention and avoid having to answer questions			0
' a psychologist who examined @entity3 during a court - ordered observation period concluded that the athlete had become severely traumatised since the killing and could become an increasing suicide risk unless he continues to get mental health care			2
the fathers of the @entity172 runner and @entity39 , a model and television personality , were in the @entity107 courtroom for the first time since the trial began in early march			1
brave : @entity147 and @entity179 arrive at the high court in @entity107 as the trial reaches it final stages support : @entity3 's father @entity183 ( above ) also made his first appearance at the trial they sat at opposite ends of a long bench in the gallery			1
@entity3 is said to be estranged from his father , @entity183 , and @entity39 's father , @entity147 , has been ill. @entity3 's older brother @entity192 , who has regularly attended court sessions , was in an intensive care unit in a @entity196 hospital and was on a ventilator because of injuries suffered in a serious car crash last week , the @entity3 family said in a statement			1
in addition to the murder charge , @entity3 faces three separate gun - related charges			2
he has pleaded not guilty to all charges			0
because @entity196 has no trial by jury , judge @entity95 will decide if @entity3 committed murder , is guilty of a negligent killing , or if he made a tragic error and should be acquitted			2
the runner also would be sent to prison for years if guilty of murder without premeditation or culpable homicide			0
@entity95 told @entity76 and @entity6 that they had only until the end of friday to complete their final arguments in court			0
' unless , of course , you want to work on a saturday and perhaps sunday , after church , ' she said , smiling			0
