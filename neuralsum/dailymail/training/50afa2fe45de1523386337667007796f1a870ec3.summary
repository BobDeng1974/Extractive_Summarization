@entity2 's @entity1 finance minister @entity0 displayed a volcanic temper during fraught talks with @entity6 leaders last week , with some observers fearing the discussions could descend into a punch - up			1
but the explosive style of the so - called ‘ rock star ’ economist may have been part of a deliberately ‘ schizophrenic ’ negotiating technique conceived while @entity0 was a student in @entity15 in the 1980s , @entity16 can reveal			1
after weeks of tense negotiations , @entity6 finance ministers finally announced on friday that they had drafted the basis for an agreement to extend @entity2 ’s bailout package for four months			0
' erratic ' : @entity2 's @entity1 finance minister @entity0 meets @entity23 chief @entity22 last week endorsed by the full 19 - member @entity25 , it should be finalised tomorrow – effectively saving @entity2 from leaving the eurozone and going bankrupt			1
during tense negotiations last week , mr @entity0 was said to have shouted ‘ liar ’ at @entity28 , chairman of the eurozone group of finance ministers , with some observers fearing that punches were about to be thrown			1
but mr @entity0 ’s erratic behaviour and outbursts may have been part of an orchestrated plan to build a ‘ reputation ’ to use as a bargaining tool			1
the @entity16 has seen mr @entity0 ’s economic thesis submitted as part of his doctorate at the @entity43 in 1987			1
the 249 - page document , titled @entity45 , discusses bargaining positions between employers and unions and is a blueprint for how to win negotiations			0
in it , mr @entity0 , who earlier this month wore a leather biker ’s jacket and boots when he met chancellor @entity54 , states that the workforce needs to accept their leader ’s ‘ peculiarities ’ to get a good outcome			2
left - wing : mr varoufakis as a lecturer in 1993 it says : ‘ in the aftermath of the strike they will have realised that in spite of his or her peculiarities their manager has come up with the goods			0
’ the thesis then discusses the merits of negotiating methods and how ‘ irrational ’ behaviour in the short term may enhance the long - term reputation of the negotiator – and get a better outcome			2
it says the best negotiator is one who lives up to a ‘ schizophrenic ideal ’ and builds a reputation			0
‘ reputation - building depends on the ability to punish the opposition and the time preference of the party in question , while at the same time , the ability to punish the opposition depends on solidarity which itself depends on the negotiator ’s reputation and the level of utility derived from being loyal , ’ it says			0
tellingly , mr @entity0 concludes : ‘ negotiators seeking to maximise the probability of persuading their opponents of their intransigence may attempt to convince themselves first			2
the ability to switch from “ conviction bargaining ” to “ pragmatic ” behaviour at the optimal point in time is of paramount importance			0
negotiators approaching this ideal will be maximising their payoffs			0
’ mr @entity0 , who has described himself as ‘ an erratic @entity1 ’ , graduated from @entity43 in 1981 , gaining a 2.2 in mathematical economics			2
he was awarded a phd in 1987			0
the @entity2 left - wing government , elected in january after promising to end austerity , stepped back from the brink last week , conceding that the current € 240 billion ( £ 180 billion ) bailout would be extended pending further talks			1
refusing to continue the current bailout had been seen as a ‘ red line ’ for the @entity2 government , and accepting that the deal is still in place is widely seen as a climbdown			0
@entity0 has until monday night to present a list of reforms his government will carry out			2
