it looks like all the the hard work paid off : the supermodel , 43 , looks better than ever in a shoot for @entity13 's online magazine			2
in the accompanying interview , she reveals the gruelling regime she undertook to prepare for a @entity16 show 14 years ago			1
@entity30 returned to the fashion house , walking for @entity16 's @entity33 show			1
the show was also a personal moment , reuniting her with the @entity16 family , ' it was emotional for me to do the show after 14 years , ' she says			1
' when i did my fitting in those amazing clothes , it was just overwhelming			0
' but even supermodels feel insecure sometimes and @entity7 admitted that when she walked onto the catwalk and the room was silent , she thought ; ’ @entity46 , they do n’t want me here ! ' in fact , her show - stopping entrance left the audience mute with admiration , instantly eclipsing models 25 years her junior			1
and although @entity7 looks better than ever at 42 , she does allow herself to indulge occasionally : ' i 'm not extreme about what i eat – i let chocolate and crisps come in at times			1
you have to allow the little things that make you happy			0
' she also attributes her physique to @entity60 , which has become ' very important '			0
in an accompanying set of pictures , @entity7 looks in fierce in pieces by @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity19 by @entity20 , @entity67 and @entity68			1
@entity7 looks fierce in pieces by @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity19 by @entity20 brought up by a single mother , @entity7 studied ballet before beginning her stellar modelling career			1
' my mum is one of my main mentors … she always gave me the best advice , ' she says			0
now it 's @entity7 's turn to be the mentor and she 's enjoying it			1
' i like the mentoring aspect , as opposed to sitting in my chair and judging someone			0
it 's really rewarding to see the models transformed and it makes me feel like i 'm doing something right			0
' the face sees @entity7 competing with fellow model judges , @entity86 and @entity87 , as they search for the next top supermodel , although she 's much more interested in the advice and help she can offer as opposed to seeing her talent win			1
she admits : ' whether my model wins or not , she will have learned and we will have helped her – that 's really why i came on the show			2
' sweater by @entity68 ; belt by @entity97 , available at @entity98 dress by @entity102 ; sandals by @entity103 ; earrings by @entity105 ; ring by @entity106 there is no one better to offer such advice to young models ; @entity7 's life has been at the very core of fashion			2
she was spotted at the age of just 15 in @entity116 's @entity115 , and from posing for the world 's greatest photographers , such as @entity119 and @entity120 , to walking for the late @entity19 and befriending the likes of @entity122 , she 's thankful to all			0
' i learned something from each and every one i worked with ; their different styles and ways of how they wanted you to be , ' she says			0
dress by @entity67 ; belt by @entity133 the face sees @entity7 competing with fellow model judges , @entity136 and @entity87 away from the modelling world , @entity7 is dedicated to a number of charities ; raising money for @entity141 , @entity143 relief , @entity144 for vulnerable children and @entity146 , her own charity that she founded in 2005			1
she remains close to @entity147 , who she describes as a huge inspiration , ' there will never be anyone like him again			0
when you meet him , you just get such a positive aura			0
' @entity7 's work also extends to the underrepresentation of black models on the covers of glossy magazines and on the runway , ' there is still racism '			2
although , she feels there has been some change in the industry for models , ' now , it 's very important to have a personality ; it 's not just about a pretty face any more			0
' not that @entity7 herself was ever ' just ' anything ; she has always been a personality			2
@entity7 was photographed by @entity173 for the edit			2
