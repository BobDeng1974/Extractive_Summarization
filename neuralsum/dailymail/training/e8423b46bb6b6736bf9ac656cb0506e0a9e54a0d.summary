a two - timing carpenter who rose to notoriety after building totem poles for a princess diana memorial park has admitted that he crushed his wife with one of his creations so he could start a new life with his mistress			1
@entity9 , 51 , entered a guilty plea in an @entity12 , @entity13 , court yesterday in the november 2010 death of wife @entity15 , who died under the weight of a massive totem pole			1
@entity15 had originally claimed that the 17 - foot totem pole fell on his wife by accident while his back was turned together : @entity9 admitted on wednesday that he killed wife @entity15 by dropping a 2,900 - pound wooden pole on her as they carved it together at their country home but his story began to unravel when an anonymous tipster came forward with ' intimate ' @entity30 messages that @entity31 had exchanged with a woman in @entity33 in the days before and after his wife 's death			1
in the string of messages , he tells the mistress - who has only been identified as ' @entity38 ' - that he loved her and wanted to move in with her			1
and on the day before the murder , he wrote to the other woman : ' i want us together to live our lives as we seek ... i am yours			2
we are one ! ' other correspondences found on @entity15 's computer showed that he was looking to buy or lease a house in @entity49 to share with the woman			1
busted : @entity9 was arrested seven months after his wife 's death police were also skeptical of @entity15 's story when their attempts to recreate the ' accident ' were unsuccessful			1
five times the detectives arranged the pole in the way that @entity15 had said , but they could not get it to fall in the way that he claimed			1
they also found that the totem pole in question had been ' stained or polyurethane - coated , ' implying that there was an attempt to cover up evidence			1
after his guilty plea was entered , @entity15 's attorney , @entity67 , told @entity13 's @entity70 newspaper : ' this whole thing is a tragic occurrence ... he did not want to put the family , his family or himself through any more misery			1
' he will be sentenced on february 4			2
@entity15 and his wife , who was 61 when she died , became famous for carving three totem poles that were used in the @entity79 section of princess @entity81 's @entity80 in @entity82 , @entity83			1
they had been working together on the carvings since 1990 on their property just outside @entity87 , in @entity88 , @entity13			2
their totem poles ranged from 16 feet to 50 feet tall			2
according to a complaint filed by the @entity93 , police arrived on the scene to find the giant carving across her chest and blood pouring from underneath her			2
she was taken to a nearby hospital but died of her injuries on november 26 , 2010			2
in an interview with reporters soon after @entity15 claimed : ' the totem we were working on was progressing wonderful			1
creative duo : @entity9 and @entity15 had been working together on the carvings since 1990 on their property just outside @entity87 , in @entity88 , @entity13 ' i mean , it was just coming really good , and we were laughing and joking and having a great conversation , just … and then it was over			1
' @entity15 was arrested in @entity113 , @entity49 , about seven months after @entity15 's death , and was later extradited back to @entity13			1
it is not clear if he was living with his mistress at the time			2
their native veterans @entity122 , honoring @entity119 @entity118 who served in the military , stands outside the @entity124 in @entity125 , @entity126			2
