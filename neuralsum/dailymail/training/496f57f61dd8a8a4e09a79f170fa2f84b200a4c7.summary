@entity0 marked his return to the @entity2 starting line - up by scoring after just nine minutes in a convincing 5 - 1 win over @entity5 that gave @entity7 â€™s team their 13th straight victory			1
the @entity9 , who also hit the crossbar in the second half , has seen @entity2 win their last seven games as he recovered from a @entity14 injury and some supporters have made no secret of the desire to seem the team left unchanged but he came in for @entity19 on saturday night at the @entity20 and helped @entity2 to yet another comfortable win			1
@entity22 played @entity23 in behind the @entity5 defence and the @entity26 midfielder crossed from the left for @entity0 to swoop at the back post and convert the centre for the opener			1
host commentator a clinical display by @entity2 restores them to the top of @entity34 with 27 points from 11 points - two clear of their eternal rivals @entity37			2
@entity7 's side have now won 13 games in a row , scoring 52 goals and it is the fifth time they 've netted five or more strikes in their last eight league matches			2
meanwhile @entity22 has 18 goals in 10 league appearances this @entity49 's all from me for tonight , but @entity50 will be back soon with more top level football action			1
the referee blows full - time on proceedings and @entity2 record their ninth successive win in @entity34 in convincing manner			1
91 mins : @entity57 is booked for a mistimed challenge on @entity59			0
90 mins : @entity60 nearly makes it six but sees his shot saved by @entity63			2
85 mins : and with that goal @entity7 makes his final changes of the match as @entity67 and @entity0 are replaced by @entity60 and @entity68			1
after making a brilliant save , @entity63 will want to forget this goal			2
real pour forward with @entity22 being found inside @entity5 's penalty area from @entity19 's pass			1
the @entity73 star cuts inside on his right foot before hitting a tame shot that goes through the grasp of @entity63 and into the net for his 23rd goal of the season in all competitions			2
79 mins : fantastic save by @entity63 once more			0
a long punt up field is headed away by the @entity5 defence but only into the path of @entity0			2
the @entity87 wizard takes one touch before unleashing a swerving 25 - yard left - footed strike that @entity63 does well to tip onto the crossbar			0
@entity91 is trying too hard perhaps , knowing this is a rare chance to impress as he comes for a cross that he was never going to get on the end of			0
real get away with it though and are still in total control			0
74 mins : @entity91 has been shaky at times in goal for real tonight and he nearly lets @entity5 score once			1
the ball is whipped into the box and the goalkeeper comes rushing out to punch , but is beaten to the ball by @entity104 who 's header just goes past the post			0
a let off for the hosts			0
73 mins : @entity5 make their third and final change			0
@entity109 comes off for @entity110 in a like - for - like swap			0
70 mins : well what can you say about @entity2 ? they 've had less possession ( 45 - 55 ) than their opponents but are devastating when in attack			0
@entity22 nearly makes it 5 - 1 bar a great save from @entity63			1
with 20 minutes remaining more goals certainly look to be on the cards			0
68 mins : @entity123 comes off for @entity19			0
one playmaker for another to add to @entity5 's woes			1
61 mins : rayo make their second change of the night with @entity128 replaced by @entity129			0
the game looks done and dusted now			0
@entity131 marches forward with the ball and finds @entity22 on the right hand side of the @entity5 penalty area			1
the 29 - year - old drills the ball across goal and @entity67 bundles it home			2
replays show that the @entity142 international was offside though			0
@entity143 is booked for a nasty challenge on @entity0 in the build - up to the goal			1
what a beautiful strike by @entity23			0
@entity22 weaves his way into the @entity5 box before toe poking the ball back on the edge of the area to @entity23			1
the @entity26 international caresses the ball into the bottom corner of the net from 20 yards for a sumptuous goal			0
just 10 seconds earlier it could have been 2 - 2			2
@entity109 finishes neatly past @entity160 but is marginally offside			0
the outlook of this match could have been so different ... 54 mins : the one criticism of @entity164 is that he does n't score enough goals and that is evident once more as @entity2 attack			1
@entity0 's intended pass for @entity169 finds @entity164 inside the @entity5 box but he curls his right - footed effort past the post			1
52 mins : over five minutes into the second half and both sides have failed to trouble each other so far ... we 're back underway at the @entity20 ... real came close to scoring a third before half - time when @entity0 's free kick just clears @entity63 's crossbar			1
as it is though it 's 2 - 1 at the break			1
@entity7 will be furious with the way his side conceded their goal - a strike that will give @entity5 some belief after the interval			1
or is it ? terrible defending by @entity2 to let @entity5 back in the match			1
@entity91 throws the ball out to @entity123			2
turning into danger the @entity194 international inexplicably tries to play a pass back to the goalkeeper but it intercepted by @entity5			0
@entity197 rounds @entity91 before tapping into an empty net			2
@entity0 sees his cross cleared behind for a corner			0
@entity123 's set piece is whipped into the box and @entity59 meets it with glancing volley that appears to come off his shin and loop into the net			1
that 's his 50th goal of the club and a long way back for @entity5			1
38 mins : great save by @entity63 ! @entity123 collects the ball from 30 yards out and runs at the @entity5 defence before unleashing a blistering left - footed drive that is brilliantly stopped by @entity63 for a corner			1
from the resulting set piece @entity67 hits the top of the crossbar with a header			0
so nearly 2 - 0 for @entity7 's side			1
35 mins : bit of magic from @entity0			0
having already scored , he collects the ball on the halfway line and turns his marker before running at the @entity5 defence			0
unfortunately for the hosts though he over hits his pass intended for @entity22			0
33 mins : the game has started to settle down after a fast start following @entity0 's goal			2
@entity5 have come into the match more as the game has grown but @entity2 look dangerous every time they attack			1
26 mins : @entity5 boss @entity233 is already forced to make a substitute at 1 - 0 down as left - back @entity235 pulls a muscle and is replaced by @entity57			1
23 mins : as @entity5 show some fight , @entity2 hit them on the break with @entity22 bursting clear			1
the @entity73 star is stopped in his tracks unceremoniously by @entity5 midfielder @entity242 and no foul is given - to the annoyance of the home supporters			0
on second evidence it should have been a free - kick and a yellow card to @entity249 as @entity235 was there to cover			1
21 mins : @entity5 are starting to show some fight			0
@entity109 and @entity197 both test @entity160			2
18 mins : it 's wave after wave of @entity2 pressure at the moment			0
it 's early days but @entity7 's side are playing brilliantly			0
@entity67 and @entity123 link up neatly before finding @entity22 inside the box			1

it did n't take long did it			0
@entity22 slips in a pass to @entity23 who whips in a low cross for @entity0 to tap into an empty net from close range			1
things are already looking ominous for the visitors			0
@entity5 fans making plenty of noise ; they have not had far to travel ... rayo a club club from the @entity278 neighbourhood of @entity2			2
6 mins : @entity2 's confidence is oozing following their amazing run of 12 successive wins and it 's showing following the opening stages of the match			1
@entity91 has n't had to make a save yet as @entity2 are starting to build some momentum			2

the hosts get the game underway ... all the facts point in favour of a @entity2 win			0
they 've scored 37 goals in @entity34 so far , sit top of the division and have won their last 12 games in all competitions			0
can @entity5 stop the @entity304 giants juggernaut ? what can more you say about @entity22			2
the @entity73 superstar has scored 22 goals in all competitions and will be hungry to add to his tally against a @entity312 side who conceded 28 goals in their last nine visits to the @entity316			0
half a chance for @entity5 tonight as @entity2 play with their second keeper			1
