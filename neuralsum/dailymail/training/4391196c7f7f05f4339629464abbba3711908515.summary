there comes a point where you have to match bits of you with the other bits , otherwise you get a terribly random situation			2

it ’s the most magical operation in the world — you go from being blind to actually seeing			0

blonde bombshell : for many years , she has been a loyal client of the five - star @entity90 salon @entity91 for many years , she has been a loyal client of the five - star @entity90 salon @entity91 , where she has it coloured and cut in a process which she complains takes more than two hours			2

’ she said that her experience in @entity121 in 2010 — in which she stunned viewers by doing the splits — made her famous rear more pert than ever because she was dancing for six or more hours a day			1
@entity20 said that taking part in @entity121 in 2010 made her famous rear more pert than ever , because she was dancing for over six hours a day @entity126 — the theatre director whom she married , divorced and is dating again — goes to the gym three or four times a week with her			1
@entity20 says he is far more health conscious than her			1
eternally trim , @entity20 has always watched her weight , briefly going on a diet of nothing but seaweed in her 20s			1
lunch is often just a bowl of @entity139 vegetable soup and a cup of coffee			0
‘ as for junk food , if i ’d ever walked down the road eating anything , my father would have clouted me , ’ she said			0
in 2009 , she said : ‘ i used to diet when i was younger because one wants to be skinny , but i do n’t diet any more			0
i do n’t like stodgy food , so i am a salad , pasta and steak girl			0
’ any vices ? well , she allows herself a couple of glasses of red wine and a sneaky cigarette if she feels like it			0
@entity20 has confessed to being ‘ rock chick ’ at heart and had her first tattoo – a star on her foot representing her younger son , @entity162 , 27 , a fledgling criminal barrister — at the relatively late age of 63			1
a year later , she had a moon surrounded by feathers inscribed on her calf , which symbolises her elder son , @entity168 , and his two children			0
she ’s now considering a third			0
@entity20 spent her childhood in @entity108 , and the cosmetic legacy is still apparent today in the sun damage you can see on her chest			1
@entity177 spots and wrinkles pepper her decolletage and hands			0
but her face , by contrast , is as smooth and pure as silk			0
how ? well , she ’s confessed to having @entity185 laser treatment on her face to combat the sun damage			0
it was administered by dr @entity188 at a cost of around £ 200 a time			0
‘ it ’s really quite painful , ’ she told an interviewer			0
‘ but it takes off brown spots and makes skin finer			0
’ devotees have to go back every three months to keep their skin looking peachy			0
enjoying the sunshine : on holiday with her family one wonders whether @entity20 will extend the treatment to her body , too , to stop the mismatch effect			1
she ’s also a fan of lathering on face cream , recently graduating from ‘ good old @entity207 ’ to the pricey cult beauty favourite @entity209 , which costs £ 103 for a tiny 30ml pot. she said : ‘ i do n’t wear a great deal of make - up , but i use lots of cream			0
