an extraordinary image captured above @entity8 shows a gigantic cloud of birds forming the shape of a two in the sky			1
the remarkable spectacle appeared over the @entity15 landmark at the end of a cloudless day			0
double trouble : the birds create a perfect figure above @entity8 in @entity15 after appearing apparently from nowhere spreadeagled : this image taken by 59 - year - old @entity21 looks like one giant pair of wings in the air photographer @entity21 captured the moment after waiting patiently beside the power station in the hope of witnessing the event , having heard of its beauty a year earlier			1
the 59 - year - old , from @entity32 , described the sight as ' sheer bliss ' , with the birds appearing to come out of nowhere			1
he said : ' i arrived at about 3.30pm and waited , wondering if i was in the correct location			2
' i had heard about this roost last year and , for various reasons , never managed to get there , but that afternoon i decided to make the effort			2
' at about 4.10pm , the first trickle of birds started to arrive and , within minutes , the sky was swirling with starlings - there were thousands of them			2
high fliers : the starlings swirl overhead in splendid formation for just a brief moment before disappearing again ' it was as if a zip in the sky had been opened			1
' the strange thing was though , despite there being thousands of birds in the sky it was very quiet , almost eerie			0
' it was sheer bliss but it seemed to pass in the blink of an eye			0
' how they managed to avoid the power line cables to create a perfect two was awesome but all too soon the starlings had gone			0

@entity21 waited at the spot after hearing about the event last year
the photographer said it looked as though ' a zip in the sky had opened '
