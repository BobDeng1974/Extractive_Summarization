they say those who are bored of @entity2 are bored of life			1
but the latest craze to sweep the capital proves that even the most obscure - and gruesome - tastes are catered for			0
taxidermy , or stuffing and posing dead animals , has become an unlikely favourite of the capital 's trendiest residents			1
but you wo n't find retro stag 's heads or large bears in the apartments of @entity17 and @entity18			0
instead , taxidermy 2.0 is all about rodents			2
cutesy : taxidermy 2.0 involves posing mice and other rodents in sugary tableaux almost human : most modern taxidermists also choose to dress their subjects in doll 's clothes classes which teach you how to gut , clean , stuff and pose a mouse into a variety of ‘ cute ’ poses such as playing the trumpet , or dancing , have proved a sell - out success , with plans to roll them out across the rest of the @entity41 already afoot			1
the brainchild of @entity45 resident , @entity46 , 35 , and @entity48 tattoo artist @entity47 , the macabre craft classes are based on traditional taxidermy techniques dating back to the @entity51 period			1
though originally envisioned as one - off pop up workshops , their popularity soon saw @entity56 enlist the help of @entity58 , a member of the @entity41 @entity60 , to launch a regular class at alternative venue @entity63			0
speaking to @entity64 , @entity56 explained : ' at first i was n't sure if there would be the demand but our first two classes sold out in just 24 hours			0
' the classes takes students through mouse taxidermy , from corpse to cute ornament in just four hours			2
students can choose to pose their mount in a naturalistic setting but are also introduced to the art of anthropomorphism - the attribution of human characteristics to animals , plants or non-living things			0
@entity85 : @entity56 also sells mouse - stuffing kits over the internet - ideal for budding taxidermists outside @entity2 self - help : @entity56 also offers a manual to guide newcomers to taxidermy through the process the anthropomorphism trend , which was last popular with the upper classes during the @entity51 era , sees the taxidermist pose and often dress the animal in imagined scenes such as in a school room , playing in a band , or having a picnic			1
for those who find mice a little tame , extended classes , which cost £ 200 each , teach students how to tackle more complex animals such as rabbits in day - long courses			1
there are also @entity85 kits available for those who ca n't get to @entity2 , with prices starting at £ 25			1
@entity56 adds : ' we had people saying they would come over from @entity117 to take the classes , even interest from @entity120 , and that 's what prompted me to make it more transferable with the kits			2
' each kit contains everything a budding taxidermist needs , from surgical gloves , long need nosed pliers , galvanised wire to @entity132 and @entity133 ( a powered mineral )			0
though the idea of gutting a mouse in your own living room may sound unappealing , over 500 of the kits have been purchased in just three weeks			0
in response to those who question the ethics of taxidermy , @entity56 says : ' all the rodents we use were bred as reptile food			0
' no animals die specifically for taxidermy and we take great care to only source the rodents from breeders who adhere to strict ethical guidelines			2

taxidermy , or *preserving* dead animals , growing in popularity
decorating trend has proved a hit in @entity2
@entity85 kits that focus on mice are available online for just £ 25
classes costing £ 200 have also proved popular
animals posed in cutesy tableaux , often wearing clothes
