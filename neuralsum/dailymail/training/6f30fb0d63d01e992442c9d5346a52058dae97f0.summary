‘ but @entity133 launches the idea of a @entity17 club championship ... whose realisation would be new and more sensational than a european championship of national teams			1
’ @entity132 wrote that until @entity6 had travelled to @entity159 or faced @entity160 and @entity161 , they could not claim any global or continental supremacy			2
but @entity163 came on board and the following season the @entity32 was born			0

‘ @entity9 went 2 - 0 up playing this one - touch passing game , but all of a sudden they could n’t manipulate the ball and kept getting stuck			1
‘ @entity6 were famous for their power game , long passing even though they had great players , and eventually overhauled them			1
’ flowers reveals : ‘ all our training was concentrated on building leg muscles			0
but we did a lot of work with benches and running up and down the terraces			0
@entity19 felt that our opponents would tire			2
what with the leather ball and the water that it gathered , you had to really belt it to move it			0
’ only the second half was on the @entity100 , but watching back home were impressionable youngsters by the name of @entity36 and @entity233			0
