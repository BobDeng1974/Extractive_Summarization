by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter there is ' no compelling medical reason ' for @entity5 armed forced to ban transgender @entity5 from serving , according to a report released on thursday			1
the independent commission led by a former @entity5 surgeon general also concluded that president @entity10 could lift the decades - old ban without approval from @entity13			1
as long - term soldiers share their stories of being kicked out of the forces , the report says the current regulations - which are designed to keep transgender people from joining or staying in the military on the basis of psychological and physical unfitness - are outdated			1
one former soldier , @entity26 capt. @entity24 , 41 , was put on leave after taking female hormones following a deployment to @entity30			1
but after notifying her battalion commander , @entity24 learned she had been placed on inactive status in november , with her hair getting long and her voice higher , she notified her battalion commander , whom she said expressed support			1
at drill time , an announcement was made to 400 colleagues at the @entity45 in @entity46			0
for a few days , @entity47 thought she might escape the ban			2
but then she was informed she had been placed on inactive status			2
' when i transitioned , i was n't just a good officer , i became a better officer because i did n't have to deal with that conflict anymore , ' she said			0
@entity47 also wrote a blog post about the incident , explaining that she had repeatedly been recognized as a good soldier , but after she revealed her desire to transition , ' i received no disability , no compensation , no handshake , no thank - you - for - your - service '			0
' in the days and weeks that followed an anger grew within me , ' she wrote			0
' not just at the way i was treated , but at the way my fellow trans service - members are cast out of the services they â€™ve given so much of their lives and devotion to			0
we are not diseased or disordered			0
' new life : @entity24 , pictured left , and right before her hormone treatment , said living as a woman made her a better soldier because she was no longer in conflict but she said did not even get a thank you for her service about 15,500 transgender personnel are currently serving , nearly all under their birth genders and not transitioning in an appearance - altering way , according to the @entity83 , a think tank			1
dr. @entity84 , who served as surgeon general during @entity87 's first term as president , and rear adm. @entity89 , a former chief health and safety director for the @entity90 , led the report that was released on thursday			1
' we determined not only that there is no compelling medical reason for the ban , but also that the ban itself is an expensive , damaging and unfair barrier to health care access for the approximately 15,450 transgender personnel who serve currently in the active , guard and reserve components , ' it said			1
the panel , convened by a think tank at @entity106 , said the ban has existed for several decades and apparently was derived in part from the psychiatric establishment 's consensus , since revised , that gender identity issues amounted to a mental disorder			0
the ban also appears based on the assumption that providing hormone treatment and sex reassignment surgeries would be too difficult , disruptive and expensive			0
but the commission rejected those notions as inconsistent with modern medical practice and the scope of health care services routinely provided to non-transgender military personnel			2
' i hope their takeaway will be we should evaluate every one of our people on the basis of their ability and what they can do , and if they have a condition we can treat we would treat it like we would treat anyone else , ' @entity123 said in an interview with the @entity0			0
report : former surgeon general dr @entity138 , left , and rear admiral @entity89 , right , led a report released on thursday that said the law about transgender military personnel was outdated at least a dozen nations , including @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity146 , allow military service by transgender individuals			1
transgender rights advocates have been lobbying the @entity150 to revisit the blanket ban in the @entity5 since @entity13 in 2010 repealed the law that barred gay , lesbian and bisexual individuals from openly serving in the military ' at this time there are no plans to change the department 's policy and regulations which do not allow transgender individuals to serve in the @entity5 military , ' said navy lt. cmdr			1
@entity163 , a defense department spokesman			0
the commission argued that facilitating gender transitions ' would place almost no burden on the military , ' adding that a relatively small number of active and reserve service members would elect to undergo transition - related surgeries and that only a fraction might suffer complications that would prevent them from serving			2
it estimated that 230 transgender people a year would seek such surgery at an average cost of about $ 30,000			0
decisions : @entity13 would not need to be involved in changing the rules , according to the report , and @entity10 could instead issue an executive order instructing the @entity181 to amend its regulations retired brigadier general @entity183 , a former @entity26 commander and @entity185 professor on the commission , said he thinks allowing transgender people to serve openly would reduce gender - based harassment , assaults and suicides while enhancing national security			1
but @entity193 president @entity192 , whose group opposed the repeal of the ban on openly gay troops , predicted that putting transgender people in barracks , showers and other sex - segregated could cause sexual assaults to increase and infringe on the privacy of non-transgender personnel			1
' this is putting an extra burden on men and women in the military that they certainly do n't need and they do n't deserve , ' @entity192 said			0
the commission recommends the president issue an executive order instructing the @entity181 to amend its regulations so transgender people are no longer automatically barred			0
the @entity150 then would need to develop rules for assigning service members who are transitioning , said @entity216 executive director @entity215 , whose @entity106 - based think tank commissioned the report			2
the @entity216 , which previously researched ' do n't ask , do n't tell , ' is funded in part by a $ 1.3 million grant from @entity221 , a billionaire former @entity26 lieutenant colonel who came out as transgender last year			2

@entity26 captain @entity24 began taking female hormones and her battalion commander expressed support
but days later , she was served inactive service papers
a report led by a former @entity5 surgeon general has said there is ' no compelling medical reason ' for the outdated ban
15,000 transgender personnel are serving in the armed forces and most are living under their birth genders and not changing their appearances
