@entity2 ebola response coordinator @entity0 may have become an accidental folk hero to fans of crushing bureaucracy everywhere on wednesday , when a @entity7 senator asked high - ranking @entity9 administration officials to describe his work			1
the vague answers sounded like something plucked out of a @entity14 cartoon			0
' even though the president has named a so - called @entity23 “ czar ” to coordinate our response , ' @entity16 ranking @entity18 @entity17 complained , ' all reports indicate that he has no actual authority to direct government agencies here			1
' he asked two cabinet secretaries and two other experts what @entity0 has ' brought to the table ' in his role as government - wide coordinator			1
assistant defense secretary @entity34 praised him for ' an excellent job of doing that , just that singular focus on coordinating			2
' @entity38 @entity17 sen. @entity17 wanted to know what the @entity9 @entity2 's ' ebola czar ' has been doing , and witnesses were vague in their answers a packed hearing room listened wednesday to an update on the federal government 's plan to fight @entity23 , and to justifications for $ 6.18 billion in new spending ' it 's a very important role , ' added @entity50 secretary @entity51 , ' in terms of when a whole - of - government effort is occurring			1
' ' and mr. @entity0 has stepped into that role and added value to our policy coordination			1
' homeland security secretary @entity59 insisted that it 's critical to have ' somebody who is dedicated full - time in the @entity2 who is doing exactly that			1
' all the witnesses said @entity0 had been in regular touch with them , ranging from ' every single day ' to ' countless times , ' but no one articulated a specific task he took on or accomplished			2
@entity0 was n't present in the room : the @entity2 has kept him away from both @entity70 hearings convened since his appointment last month			2
@entity14 , a widely read comic strip by @entity74 , follows the foibles of a man caught in the cogworks of a big - company bureaucracy			0
@entity14 is tapped to ' coordinate ' a minor business project in this 2010 @entity74 cartoon days later the boss was the only person interested in hiring a coordinator to harmonize his staff 's approach to a problem @entity17 asked @entity51 whether @entity0 has the authority to direct government agencies to do anything , and she replied that his ' coordination ' authority stops where government power begins			1
' policy coordination with regard to the execution of the agencies ' responsibilities – those sit with me and with the heads of our operating divisions like dr. @entity103 , ' she said , referring to the @entity105 director who has been the administration 's public face on @entity23 preparedness and epidemiology			1
@entity17 and other @entity18 , though , have complained about a @entity2 that was slow on the uptake when the an @entity23 victim first turned up in @entity112			2
he said @entity9 's team has ' sent mixed messages on the issue of quarantine , ' and ' did not call for enhanced airport screenings for travelers entering the @entity7 from @entity119 until months after the epidemic became severe			0
' ' not surprisingly , ' he said , ' @entity7 have been frustrated by the lack of clarity and coordination within their government			2
' @entity2 ebola czar @entity0 emerged from behind the scenes on tuesday to talk with the @entity9 administration - friendly @entity127 , but has n't spoken in congressional hearings @entity130 : @entity0 ( 2nd left , back row ) sits in on @entity23 meetings with some of the witnesses who testified wednesday , but they could n't articulate anything specific that he 's accomplished even though there are no confirmed cases of @entity23 in the @entity7 right now , deputy secretary of state @entity137 warned that @entity7 are n't yet out of the woods			1
' it is important to realize that epidemic is not yet controlled , ' she told senators , ' and that the number of cases will continue to grow			0
' @entity0 privately briefed congressional leaders on friday at the @entity2 and appeared tuesday on @entity127 – saying that ' we ’re going to see occasional additional cases of @entity23 in our country			1
' the @entity16 hearing was called to explore the @entity9 administration 's request for $ 6.18 billion in emergency funding to fight the disease			0
@entity156 chairwoman @entity155 of @entity157 , gaveling her last hearing before @entity18 take over in january , seemed to be in favor of releasing the money			0
' we 're working together with the international community to stop the spread of the virus within the three countries , ' she noted , ' as well as to contiguous countries and other locations around the world			0
that is why protecting the @entity7 is essential			0
' ' policy coordination ... sits with me , ' said hhs secretary @entity51 , seeming to confirm that @entity0 has no authority to take action @entity174 ? @entity9 's ' ebola czar ' is n't exactly a rousing success , with 40 per cent of @entity7 saying they 've never heard of him and just 10 per cent saying he 's doing a good job @entity0 , a longtime @entity156 operative who served a chief of staff to vice presidents @entity180 and @entity181 , has had a rough start in his role			1
in a @entity186 / @entity185 poll during the last days of october , just 10 per cent of @entity7 said they approved of his job performance			0
that 's a lower number than the dismal ratings of @entity190 itself			0
fully 40 per cent of adults surveyed said they had never heard of him			0
following the october 24 @entity23 hearing in the @entity197 , chairman rep. @entity194 of @entity195 said it was understandable that @entity0 did n't appear since he was getting up to speed			2
but ' we do not expect that that would be repeated if there ’s a followup hearing , ' he cautioned .			0

senators convened wednesday to hear @entity23 funding requests from cabinet - level agencies
@entity38 sen. @entity17 asked top officials from @entity211 , @entity50 and @entity212 what @entity23 czar @entity0 ' brings to the table '
a ' singular focus on coordinating , ' a @entity217 bigwig gushed
@entity0 is ' dedicated full - time in the @entity2 , ' said the @entity211 chief
@entity50 secretary says he has ' added value to our policy coordination '
@entity0 skipped the hearing but appeared on @entity127 to warn that there will be more ebola cases in the @entity7
