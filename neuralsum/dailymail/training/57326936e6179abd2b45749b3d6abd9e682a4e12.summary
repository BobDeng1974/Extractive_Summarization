by @entity0 and @entity1 and @entity2 ' @entity3 ' : @entity4 is now being denied citizenship in the @entity6 due to a speeding fine which he received in april 2011 he has served in the @entity10 for four years with an ‘ exemplary record ’ , but @entity12 has now been ordered out of the @entity6 – because of a speeding offence			1
the 32 - year - old from @entity15 has had his application for citizenship rejected by the @entity18 who claimed the single offence was a sign of ‘ bad character ’			1
officials ruled the soldier should be bracketed with murderers , rapists and drug dealers – ordering him to quit the country by next friday			1
it is a decision that effectively leaves @entity30 stateless as he faces certain arrest , prosecution and up to 25 years in jail if he returns to @entity15 which deems enlisting in a foreign army a criminal offence			1
his case has left the government accused once again of ‘ betraying ’ the military , following round after round of spending cuts			1
and it comes days after the furore over @entity46 - born lance corporal @entity45 , 32 , a veteran of @entity47 and @entity48 , who was threatened with deportation last month because he was disciplined by his commanding officer for a fight with a colleague in 2010			2
following an outcry , he was granted an 11th hour reprieve			2
campaigners for @entity30 contrast his case with that of foreigners who have been allowed to stay despite awful crimes , such as @entity60 , who left a girl of 12 to die under the wheels of his car			2
@entity65 ’s supporters have urged @entity66 to intervene , pointing out the @entity18 ’s decision is at odds with the @entity70 ’s pledge to uphold the @entity71 , society ’s duty of care to servicemen			1
@entity30 said : ‘ for speeding , i am being treated the same as a murderer or drug lord or a burglar			1
if i go back home i ’ll be thrown in jail			1
if i stay here , i ’ll be breaking the law			2
’ the veteran , who has a six - month - old baby girl @entity85 in @entity86 with his ex-girlfriend , enlisted as a @entity89 serviceman in the @entity90 in august 2008			2
on exercise : @entity92 with the @entity90 in @entity93 last year he was eager to fulfil his dream of being a soldier but was too old to join the @entity96			2
he said : ‘ @entity47 and @entity48 were still going on			0
i knew i might have to put my life on the line and go to a warzone			0
i was prepared for that			0
’ @entity30 , who lives in @entity101 , became a design draughtsman – drawing up plans for bases , roads and other construction projects – and joined 73 @entity107 , 21 engineer regiment			0
he completed exercises in the @entity6 and @entity93			0
in august 2011 , he gave 12 months notice he wanted to leave the @entity10 to take a degree in archaeological technology at @entity113 – a move ‘ fully supported ’ by commanders			0
in april this year , he applied for @entity6 citizenship ahead of his @entity10 leaving date , august 31			0
but the @entity18 rejected his bid because he had received a £ 100 fine and five penalty points for speeding on the @entity121			1
he had been doing 81mph in a 50mph roadworks zone at 1.30am			0
his officer commanding , major @entity124 , wrote to the agency praising his ‘ exemplary record of conduct ’ in the @entity10			0
the @entity10 was ‘ genuinely concerned ’ that @entity30 could be arrested and prosecuted if he was sent home to @entity15			1
veterans aid chief executive dr @entity131 , who has been helping fight @entity30 ’s case , said : ‘ we recruited @entity12 and now we are treating him as if he is illegal			0
‘ it springs to my mind these people appear disposable , almost like slavery , and no - one seems to care			0
’ since january , veterans aid has dealt with 70 former @entity89 soldiers who face being thrown out of @entity6			0
a @entity18 spokesman said : ‘ each claim for settlement is considered on individual circumstances and in line with published policy			1

@entity148 could be sent back to @entity15
the @entity18 claimed speeding offence was a sign of ' bad character '
