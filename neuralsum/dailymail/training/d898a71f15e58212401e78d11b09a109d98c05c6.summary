how i feel for our future queen			1
i was 34 , just over three years older than @entity3 is now			1
i remember how the joy and excitement at the thought of a baby on the way was overshadowed by the sudden and violent onslaught of nausea that took hold at about four weeks			1
‘ oh , it will go away quickly enough , ’ said everyone kindly , passing me ginger biscuits and cups of peppermint tea			1
so ill : @entity25 , from @entity26 , suffered the same condition as @entity3 but went on to have a healthy son			1
it felt like being poisoned : @entity25 struggled with acute morning sickness just like @entity3 these homely ‘ cures ’ for morning sickness did nothing			1
in fact , they only made things worse			2
strangely , to start with , i found passing relief from chewing the toughest of @entity41 hard gums			2
but even this home - devised remedy was soon powerless against a tide of nausea so strong , so all - encompassing , so toxic that it sucked all the colour out of life			1
i could think of nothing but the nausea and the metallic taste in my mouth – and soon the vomiting began			1
it sounds a strange way to describe a pregnancy , but it felt as if i was being poisoned			2
the nausea was there every waking minute , but the actual vomiting could be triggered by almost anything , ranging from certain colours ( there is still a certain shade of pinky - red i can barely look at ) , smells ( even the supposedly friendly camomile ) and any attempt to eat or drink			1
even water , however slowly i sipped it , was impossible to keep down			2
at my worst , i was sick up to 30 times a day			2
all morning , yes , but also noon and night			2
the name ‘ morning sickness ’ came to sound like a cruel joke			2
the great convulsions of my body each time i made a mad dash to the toilet terrified me			2
when i visited my gp after ten days of this hell i was told to pull myself together			2
only when i failed to make it to the door of her surgery without retching over her yucca plant – a spasm triggered by her perfume – did she agree to take my pulse and blood pressure			2
fortunately she decided to send me straight to hospital in a cab , with me clutching on to the inside of the door , willing the contents of my stomach ( already very sparse ) to stay down			2
my head was pounding and i was beginning to feel quite confused			2
my skin was itchy and dry			2
at @entity98 ’s , a specialised maternity hospital in west @entity99 , they were both immediately attentive and kind			2
at last , what was happening to me was not seen as fabricated or beyond help			0
there is something very isolating about this condition when you compare it to the glowing health and poise of so many women who make pregnancy look easy			1
i seemed to be making such a hash of it			0
yet i discovered that up to one in 50 women suffers some form of hyperemesis gravidarum ( which literally means very severe pregnancy sickness ) , but only a handful have it as badly as i did			1
nausea : @entity122 , who suffered extreme morning sickness , feels for @entity3 , pictured last week poorly : @entity3 has been taken to hospital with hyperemesis gravidarum , which usually leaves women on a drip because they ca n't eat or drink i saw on my notes that i had three plus signs against my diagnosis , meaning i was a particularly severe case			1
it is likely it became so serious because i was not treated straight away – not all gps are on the look - out for the condition and there is a widespread assumption amongst some doctors that a fuss is being made over mere ‘ morning sickness ’			1
i trust that , at the king edward vii hospital in central @entity99 , @entity3 is receiving the early and assiduous treatment she needs to keep it under control			1
one of the immediate steps is likely to be rehydration			0
the reason that my skin was so dry and itchy – and looked like that of a woman 30 years older – was that i had failed to retain any water for many days by this stage			0
doctors put me on an intravenous drip , swapping the bags between saline , sugar and potassium			0
nobody ever told me what the potassium was supposed to do for me			0
i was ordered to stay in my bed and rest – not a difficult instruction to follow as by now my legs felt like jelly			0
at first the vomiting continued			0
one terrible night – the loneliest of my life – i remember i was bringing up scary quantities of blood			0
extreme : even sipping water was impossible to keep down according to @entity25 , who suffered the same condition during pregnancy as @entity3 , pictured with prince @entity175 it turned out that i had ripped my oesophagus , which was excruciating as the bile ( by now the only contents of my stomach ) burned the wound as it passed up through my body			1
the doctors moved me to a room of my own and posted a ‘ nil by mouth ’ sign above my bed , as anything passing my lips could trigger yet more vomiting			0
even a toothbrush was banned			0
meanwhile , they started to pump @entity194 ( normally used for ulcers but intended to help my oesophagus heal ) and anti-sickness drugs into my veins			0
i pleaded not to have these drugs , remembering all too well the terrible effects of thalidomide on an earlier generation of pregnant women			1
but the serious look on my doctors ’ faces as they sat next to my bed made it clear i had no choice			0
so uncomfortable was this method of administering the drugs that the doctors switched to injections			0
my backside – now quite bony anyway – was soon too black and blue to lie on			0
gradually , though , i started to feel more human , and the doctors thought i was well enough to explain that my condition was caused in effect by a severe reaction to the pregnancy hormone @entity215 ( human chorionic gonadotropin )			1
@entity215 can trigger the mildest of reactions , such as a passing morning sickness , or at the worst , a virtual bodily shutdown , as i endured			0
care : @entity25 describes the medical care given to her when suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum			1
@entity224 of @entity225 is receiving treatment at the @entity227 in @entity99 pictured doctors ran constant checks to make sure my vital organs were still functioning			0
it is possible that this severe reaction may run in families ; another school of thought attributes it to the mother ’s blood group being negative when the father ’s is positive			0
i just hope that @entity3 is not at my end of the spectrum – and that her suffering passes , as it sometimes does , at around 13 weeks			1
@entity243 continued at varying levels , requiring further hospitalisations , right to the end			0
i lost a lot of weight even though i was pregnant			1
it worries me that @entity3 herself has so little to lose as it is not uncommon for sufferers to shed up to a tenth of their body weight			1
my condition almost certainly triggered my waters breaking at 33 weeks and the premature birth of my son , @entity259			1
yet bizarrely as soon my waters broke , the symptoms disappeared entirely and i ate my first meal for seven months before i went into hospital			0
i still remember the joy			1
i hope @entity3 will be lucky and that early intervention will save her some of the agonies i endured			1
treatment is improving all the time , as is recognition of the condition			1
the danger of accompanying depression is also now better understood			0
my own case was , i know , studied with interest by medics			0
but if left untreated , hyperemesis can be dangerous for the baby and the mother too , particularly if she becomes too dehydrated			1
the @entity278 novelist @entity277 is understood to have died from it – and deaths , although rare , are not unknown even now			0
i loved my son so much when he arrived i was able in time to put the whole experience behind me			0
surely it could not be so bad second time round , i thought			0
so i got pregnant again two years later			1
ladies , i went through the same hellish experience			0
so i stopped at two children			0
i rather wonder if the royal couple will do the same .			0
