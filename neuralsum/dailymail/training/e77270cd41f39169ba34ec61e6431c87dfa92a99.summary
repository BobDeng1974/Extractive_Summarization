@entity0 was only ever supposed to be a sparsely populated northern outpost on @entity3 's border with @entity4			1
but then in 2012 civil war broke out and the human tide began to flow across the border and the desert township became a city of of makeshift tents			2
the 3km refugee housing zone was designed to cater for 10,000 refugees , but in the space of two years , it 's grown to 13 times its original size and now must house 130,000 refugees			1
@entity0 is now @entity3 's fourth - largest city and the world 's second - largest refugee camp			1
the @entity19 is now calling the refugee crisis from the @entity4 civil war one of the worst humanitarian crises in history			1
the flow of refugees across the border and into @entity0 shows no signs of slowing up			2
on some days , 4,000 people cross the border in search of a better life			0
but despite these odds , @entity32 , the chief of the @entity33 in @entity3 , reckons his team on the ground have got the situation ' under control ' and found a way to fit the desperate into the camp			2
they 've started on another camp , @entity43 , which will eventually house 100,000 refugees - who the @entity19 expect to keep flowing across the border			1
' i think we have generally got things under control , ' he said confidently			0
' but what we do need though is continued resources to keep making sure these people have got food , shelter , water and healthcare available			0
refugees are now being being taken here from the border and the overcrowded @entity0 camp to raise the world 's awareness of the scale of the problem they are facing , mr @entity32 and @entity74 photographer @entity73 have shot a series of imagines of life in @entity0 and the new @entity43 camp			1
the images show the hardship of those who have endured the terrifying trip across from @entity4 and across the border , where they pray and hope to be picked up by @entity33 personnel and taken into camp as refugees			2
mr @entity32 , a former @entity88 diplomat originally from @entity89 in @entity90 , has plenty of experience to on the humanitarian front line			2
he 's worked for the @entity19 in @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96 before taking control of @entity0 in 2012			2
now he is helping to build @entity43 , pictured above , which will be a semi-permanent place of residence already starting to cater for up to 100,000 refugees who will continue to arrive as long as the war in @entity4 continues			1
mr @entity32 told @entity102 that he turned his back on a good career to return to @entity105 to keep working on the relief effort			1
he would rather build a better life for these refugees than seek the safety of a job back in @entity88			0
one of the biggest headaches he faces is predicting how many refugees will turn up at the border each day			0
' hundreds of thousands of people are crossing the border , ' he told @entity102			0
' at one point we were getting somewhere between 3,500 to 4,000 people fleeing @entity4 during the night			0
' @entity32 ( third from left with sunglasses on his head ) and soldiers on the ground in @entity3 help a person cross the border from @entity4 into @entity3 mr @entity32 said it 's hard to translate these statistics into individual stories of hardship , but he says they are all seeking a better , safer , life			1
' everyone has a different story			0
many of the children have lost their parents , their guardians , their families ... some children are asking when are we going to school , where are we going next			0
' the lucky ones have connections in @entity3 - a country long regarded as an asylum for refugees			0
he said @entity3 's people , many refugees themselves , are very ' welcoming and hospitable ' and know what it is like to leave your family , possessions and comforts behind			1
' @entity3 is a fantastic country in terms of it 's intake of refugees , ' he said			0
' the @entity3 are a very hospitable country and there are plenty of descendants of refugees already living here			0
' while he said water , medicine and general living conditions at the @entity0 and @entity168 refugee camps are at their most basic , the day - to - day struggles are usually far better than the bloodshed back home in @entity4			1
@entity43 is the better of the two camps , with its neat rows of purpose - built shelters that will eventually be able to cope with the overcrowded numbers of people populating the makeshift @entity178 tents			0
it is , for now , the @entity33 's answer to the unfolding crisis and the overcrowding of new arrivals which he hopes ends with the end of conflict back in @entity4			0
@entity4 refugees with just the clothes on their back and some basic essentials make the journey through to @entity3 where they are guarded by soldiers working on the ground humanitarian workers from @entity33 on border patrol survey the morning sunset as they prepare to meet a raft of new @entity4 arrivals upon arrival at temporary camps exhausted refugees receive water and @entity33 food packages before being loaded into trucks and transported to processing centers , and eventually , @entity206			1
a shot across the makeshift @entity0 refugee camp where photographer @entity73 captured this photo with a flock of pigeons flying above at sunset @entity214 by night shows the true size and scale of the region which is now overpopulated and at 13 times the capacity it was originally built to handle often , children become temporarily displaced from their parents because of the rush and large numbers of people crossing the border into @entity4 @entity33 chief @entity32 is as much a part of the on - ground relief effort as the rest of his team the biggest challenge facing the @entity230 , mr @entity32 said , is that there is no estimating when the traffic of human crossings will stop many of the children that cross the border travel for days on an end wearing the same clothes , some flee from their @entity4 houses in the dead of night wearing just their pyjamas and no shoes @entity3 has an incredibly welcoming hospitality and is known for its long - established history of accepting of refugees @entity230 's top priority is to get refugees across the border , which at times , is a violent place where gun fire is commonplace refugees battle the difficult terrain and dry desert region in @entity3 's north despite the hardship facing children at the refugee camps , these three still manage a smile for the camera as they play football in the desolate and isolated conditions newly arrived @entity4 refugees wait at a desert processing center before they are transferred onward for registration and in most cases transfer to @entity273 camps			1
food is limited , but without the help of the @entity33 many of these young children would battle to survive man children are unaware of the situation back home , where as for others who have lost family members the realisation of fleeing is very real these refugees are being taken to processing centres , where they will be then sent to @entity206			0
water is a finite resource in these overcrowded regions of @entity3 , where every refugee pitches in to help each the extremely hot and arid temperatures in @entity3 's eastern desert makes conditions difficult for a swelling number of @entity4 refugees @entity4 's visit a well in @entity43 camp where they load up on essential supplies such as water the @entity33 is a the world 's largest humanitarian agency and has an international staff of more than 8,600 people working across 126 countries			1
education and healthcare are the @entity33 's top priority for these young children in @entity3 camps who also manage to find time playing during the day			2

@entity4 refugee crisis escalated in 2012 , with thousands making the *treacherous* border crossing into @entity3
these photos *highlight* the day - to - day struggles of the human movement from @entity4 into @entity3 's camps
the @entity0 camp , a makeshift home for refugees , has reached 13 times its capacity housing up to 130,000 people
