' remember that nice @entity65 restaurant in @entity73 that we used to go to ? and then when the film came out , the owner of the restaurant said we 're not allowed in anymore because we apparently denigrated a certain ethnic group for the picture ? ' said @entity2			1

' @entity16 was just telling a story in rehearsal about something that happened to him in @entity114 , ' said @entity9			2

' he said , ' i want to shoot this like a gangster , '' said @entity9			0
'' ' if i want to freeze frame , if i want to voice over , if i want to whatever ... " and that 's what he did			0

' that mindset paid off			0

@entity13 , who portrayed @entity99 the mob capo that takes @entity9 's @entity39 under his wing , thinks @entity2 went beyond reinventing the genre			1

the film also stars @entity11 as @entity243 ' @entity242			0
@entity11 is one of the film festival 's co-creators			0
' the fact that he helped put it together right after 9/11 and bring @entity73 back as well as @entity4 — that was just honorable in itself			0
and to sustain it for so long now , it represents a great thing in movies , that 's great for movies , and a great thing for the city , ' @entity9 said			0
@entity11 , @entity258 and @entity259 founded the @entity7 in 2002 as a means of stimulating the lower @entity262 neighborhood after the sepember 11 attacks			0
