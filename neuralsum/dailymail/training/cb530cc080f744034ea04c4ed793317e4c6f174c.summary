finals fan : former @entity4 and @entity5 star , now @entity6 pundit , @entity2 enjoyed the back - end of the season as a player @entity2 adores may ’s league play - offs			1
a chance to upset the odds			0
in his pomp as the @entity21 back rower everyone loved to hate , his @entity4 side became masters in timing their run from the pack to peak at just the right moment			1
three years in succession they finished second in the pecking order but when the @entity33 trophy was handed out at @entity34 a few weeks later , the roles were reversed			0
@entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 , teams that finished ahead of @entity4 in the regular season , were all swatted aside in consecutive showpiece deciders from 2003 to 2005			1
it ’s a trend not confined to @entity5			2
topping the @entity43 table and securing the no 1 seeding for the play - offs has been no precursor to end - of - season glory			1
just once in the four seasons so far since doing away with the first - past - the - post system has the no 1 team lifted the trophy			1
@entity52 have suffered twice , losing finals after leading the way into may , and they are now in that dangerous position again having topped the pile with no guarantee of a title			1
‘ it ’s exciting , ’ enthuses @entity2			2
‘ the play - offs are here to stay now			2
obviously , i enjoyed the concept [ as a player ] because we did n’t moan about them when they were introduced , we just got on and made sure we were well placed to win			0
last hurrah : @entity66 could play his last game in the @entity43 semi-final against @entity69 on saturday ‘ when you have international rugby that is played at the same time as club rugby and your best players , your international players , are taken away from you for a third of the season then to have a first - past - the - post situation is not really appropriate			1
‘ the play - offs are fair and equitable			2
it allows you to continue to produce players for international rugby without a club being penalised for them being taken away from you			0
’ the concept is n’t completely perfect , though			0
as someone who prided himself on being the best player he could be for his country , he believes it ’s unfair that @entity90 rugby has been pencilled in across the southern hemisphere on june 7 just a week after the finals in the various @entity94 leagues			2
‘ maybe in another year we might get some common sense and the people who are planning things might plan things a little bit better , ’ he says , dissatisfied that @entity5 , @entity95 and @entity96 will all have very little time to prepare for their summer tours			1
triumph : @entity2 lifts the 2007 @entity106 trophy at @entity34 as the captain of @entity4 fairytale : @entity2 says it would be brave to bet against @entity66 enjoying the perfect finale the @entity33 is where @entity2 still earns a crust , swopping his boots for the @entity6 mic			1
he was rostered in for friday night ’s semi-final between @entity115 and @entity39 ( won 21 - 20 by @entity116 ) but will be keeping an eye on the @entity43 , particularly to see whether @entity118 leaves @entity52 behind the same way he did @entity95 - with a trophy in his hand			1
@entity2 was the boogie man who inspired @entity4 to ruin @entity122 ’s going away party in 2005 , going on at the time about how all the talk about the @entity126 winning skipper retiring wound up the @entity127 ’ dressing room			1
the sense of mischief should naturally be similar in the @entity69 dressing room			2
as much as they respect @entity118 they will want to send him into retirement on a bum note , but @entity2 believes there is no reason why the @entity139 legend ca n’t go out on a high			2
‘ when you have players of the stature of @entity122 and @entity118 , then naturally there is going to be a huge amount written , quite rightly , about their success and the build - up to the fairytale ending			0
‘ @entity118 will want to have a say in that as well and being the quality player he is there is no reason why the best players in the world ca n’t go out winning trophies … it would take a tough man to back against him			1
’ retired himself since 2008 , @entity2 , an @entity5 @entity126 2015 ambassador , was in @entity158 on thursday to co-present with @entity159 at the first @entity161 summit			1
legends : @entity66 ( left ) with @entity163 after @entity164 knocked @entity52 out of the @entity106 while there he admits he detected a sense of hunger for @entity95 to dream aloud and pitch for the 2023 @entity126			1
having been involved in @entity5 ’s operation , he suggests there is no obstacle to a competitive bid			1
‘ there is no reason why @entity95 ca n’t put together a very credible and strong bid that would require the collaboration of the whole country			1
i know it has been talked about and i ’m sure it will continue to be something to be talked about and will gather more momentum and pace			0
‘ there seems to be a huge appetite to take a potential bid to the next stage			0
there needs to be a lot of agreement and discussion , and it will also need to involve various stakeholders which is the @entity139 government , the various cities that could potentially host the tournament and the different sports as well like soccer and @entity197			0
‘ clearly , in the same way in @entity5 the rugby community could n’t host a tournament of this size on its own , i ’m sure @entity95 would agree that they would probably need to reach out to everyone in the country			1
‘ there ’s lots of learning and sharing , is n’t there ? the @entity126 is the third biggest sports event on the planet and it ’s quite hard to believe it ’s now less than 500 days to go			0
’ former @entity5 skipper @entity2 believes there is no greater sport than rugby to help disadvantaged kids get their lives back on track			1
his @entity219 has raised £ 7million for a variety of charities since 2009 and he ’s especially inspired that the opportunity he provides to play rugby has been snapped up by numerous teenagers			0
‘ @entity224 was a big part of my life and i feel very strongly we have a duty and responsibility to give back			2
setting up the foundation allows me to channel that energy into something i feel very passionate about			0
‘ i run a rugby programme that goes all over the @entity234 and delivers rugby to kids that have even been excluded or expelled from school			0
the values around the game have got the ability to help those types of young people turn their lives around , ’ he said			0
‘ they can benefit from the support system which the values of the game provides			0
@entity224 is about collective responsibility and doing things together			0
the difference between young kids who are successful and get on in life tend to be the support they receive , not just from their parents but from the wider community			0
' @entity224 certainly gave me a direction and focus in my life			0
i ’m not talking about all these kids becoming @entity90 rugby players but what it does is it builds up their confidence , builds up their self - esteem			2

former @entity5 and @entity267 is a big supporter of finals *series*
he won @entity272 with @entity4 from 2003 - 2005 with @entity273 after finishing second on the table at the end of the season
@entity52 host @entity69 in the @entity43 semi-final on saturday
only once in four seasons has the team who tops the @entity43 won the final
@entity66 will be hoping the semi is his second - last game of rugby
@entity2 said : ' it would take a tough man to back against him '
an ambassador for the @entity294 in @entity21 , @entity2 says nothing stands in the way of a successful @entity95 bid for the 2023 event
