a sensational new theory about the @entity1 claims to destroy the core belief of @entity3 - that @entity4 rose from the dead			1
art historian @entity5 is convinced the @entity1 is real and did touch @entity4 's body			1
but the @entity8 academic insists that the image on the cloth fooled the @entity11 into believing @entity4 had come back to life , and the resurrection was in fact an optical illusion			1
theory : while @entity8 academic @entity5 believes the shroud is real , he claims the image of @entity4 fooled the apostles into believing he had risen from the dead if true , this radically reshapes the version of the events which led to the birth of @entity3 as a world religion , now followed by more than two billion people			1
his theory is that in the mind of a person 2,000 years ago , the image on the @entity1 would have been astonishing - far beyond their normal experiences and truly unsettling			2
' they saw the image on the cloth as the living double of @entity4 , ' he said			1
illusion ? the image of @entity4 as it appears on the shroud			1
@entity39 believe it was the burial cloth that wrapped @entity4 's body after the crucifixion ' back then images had a psychological presence , they were seen as part of a separate plain of existence , as having a life of their own			1
' ' if you think yourself into the whole experience of the apostles			2
going into the tomb three days after the crucifixion , in the half - light , and seeing that image emerging from the burial cloth , ' the 40 - year - old academic told @entity58			1
according to the @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity5 , @entity62 and a number of disciples saw @entity4 in the flesh after his death			1
this proved he was the son of @entity69 and became the central tenet of @entity3 faith and theology			0
belief : the resurrection as portrayed by @entity76 master @entity75 in 1460 in the @entity78 , after the @entity77 crucified @entity4 , he was buried in a tomb , but @entity69 raised him from the dead and he appeared to many people over a span of forty days before his ascension to @entity84			1
@entity39 celebrate the resurrection of @entity4 on @entity86 , the third day after @entity87 , the day of his crucifixion			1
the resurrection story appears in more than five locations in the @entity59			2
but @entity91 - a self - confessed ' shroudie ' who has been intrigued by the its mystery since childhood - has a radically different view			0
he has spent eight years on @entity97 : the @entity1 and the @entity98 , due to be published next monday			0
it is the latest in a long list of works claiming to have solved the riddle of the @entity1			0
in 1988 the @entity103 , which controls access to the artifact , allowed radiocarbon dating on portions of a swatch taken from a corner of the shroud			2
independent tests in 1988 at the @entity112 , the @entity113 , and the @entity114 concluded that the shroud material dated to 1260 â€“ 1390 ad , with 95 per cent confidence			2
these dates corresponded with the first appearance of the shroud in church history			0
the tests were criticised , with some saying the sample taken for analysis may have been a part repaired in the medieval period			0
but others insist this answers the mystery of the @entity129 origins and authenticity			0
but in december 2011 , physicist @entity131 published a critical compendium of the major hypotheses regarding the formation of the body image on the shroud			2
he stated that ' none of them can completely explain the mysterious image '			0
many believe the linen cloth was the shroud in which @entity4 's body was buried after it was cut from the crucifix on @entity145 , and displays an image of his body			1
but debate has raged for decades about its authenticity			0
since a 1988 radiocarbon dating test put its age at between 1260 and 1390 , many have just assumed the @entity1 , which is held in the @entity155 of the @entity156 in @entity157 , northern @entity150 , is a medieval forgery			0
but conclusive proof has not yet been advanced			0
@entity91 's new book claims to prove the botched sampling of the cloth and the last - minute abandonment of agreed procedures mean that the carbon dating test was seriously flawed			0
@entity91 , who is based in @entity166 , @entity8 , believes the @entity1 was looted as bounty by @entity169 knights and the @entity170 who sacked @entity171 in 1204			2
he is convinced modern analysis proves the @entity1 is genuine ; that pollens lifted from cloth fibres indicate that it was once in @entity176 ; a seam used in the weave of the linen is identical to one found only on a first - century cloth from @entity181 ; the wound - marks are composed of real blood ; and an alternative , peer - reviewed test of the age of the linen found that it was over 1300 years old			0
he contends that the negative quality of the image also explains why , in the @entity191 , the disciples are at first unable to recognize the @entity4 and he says his version of the @entity193 can be interpreted from passages in the @entity59			1
he points to @entity195 15 - 50 in which the @entity11 says unequivocally that ' resurrection is not about flesh and blood ' .			0
