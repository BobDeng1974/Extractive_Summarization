by @entity1 reporter published : 03:43 est , 31 july 2012 updated : 09:22 est , 31 july 2012 seal flu could pose a new threat to human health , scientists have warned			1
a new flu virus identified in @entity8 harbour seals has the potential to pass to other mammals , including humans , say experts			1
the @entity14 strain was discovered after the death of 162 @entity17 harbour seals last year			1
post-mortem examinations of five of the animals showed they were killed by a flu infection			2
new threat : @entity22 killed more than 100 harbour seals in @entity17 recently the strain is closely related to one that has been circulating in @entity8 birds since 2002			1
but unlike the bird strain , it has adapted to living in mammals			2
it has also evolved mutations known to ease transmission and cause more severe symptoms			2
specifically , the virus has the ability to target proteins known as cytokines found in human lungs			1
this could cause the immune system to go into overdrive and attack itself , causing tissue damage			1
dr @entity44 , from @entity45 in @entity46 , who led the researchers , said : ' there is a concern that we have a new mammalian - transmissible virus to which humans have n't been exposed yet			2
it 's a combination we have n't seen in disease before			0
' the warning is published in the online journal of the @entity57 , @entity58			0
one cause for concern was the fact that few scientists had considered the possibility of a bird flu virus infecting seals , said the researchers			1
it highlighted the fact that pandemic influenza can appear in unexpected ways			0
' @entity22 could emerge from anywhere and our readiness has to be much better than we previously realised , ' said dr @entity44			0
' we need to be very nimble in our ability to identify and understand the potential risks posed by new viruses emerging from unexpected sources			0
' it 's important to realise that viruses can emerge through routes that we have n't considered			0
we need to be alert to those risks and ready to act on them			0
' as of january 2012 , the @entity82 has confirmed there have been 583 cases of @entity85 ( avian flu ) in humans leading to 344 deaths			0
there have been no human cases in the @entity91 however the strain was found in a flock of turkeys in @entity95 in 2007 and in wild swans in @entity97 in 2008 .			1

the @entity14 strain was discovered after the death of 162 @entity17 seals
the virus could target a protein found in human lungs causing immune system to go into overdrive and attack itself
this would leave lungs *vulnerable* to *pneumonia* and *bacterial* infections
