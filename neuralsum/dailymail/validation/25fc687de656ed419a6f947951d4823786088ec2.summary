@entity0 disappeared straight down the tunnel of the @entity2 on sunday night while the rest of his team - mates went to the centre - circle to applaud supporters			1
it followed a strange night for the @entity9 forward just seven days ahead of the @entity10			0
he failed to celebrate @entity12 ’s opening goal because he was too busy lamenting his own misfortune at not scoring			1
@entity0 failed to connect properly with a scissor kick from the edge of the area and when the ball was headed off the line @entity12 volleyed it into the top corner			1
incredibly @entity0 could be seen throwing his arms up in the air both before and after @entity12 converted the rebound			2
@entity0 can not mask his frustration after striking the post with an early chance to put @entity9 ahead the @entity27 endured a difficult game , with his temper bubbling below the surface it was a tough night for @entity0 , who will need to improve in time for next week 's @entity10 @entity33 tweeted : ‘ @entity0 's extraordinarily stroppy reaction to @entity12 scoring from a rebound from his effort was bizarre and unhealthy			1
’ @entity0 was also frustrated when @entity12 scored his second goal getting the slightest of touches on a @entity0 shot but enough to divert it past the @entity43 goalkeeper to wrap up the three points			1
he also missed a string of chances the day after he was overtaken by @entity47 in @entity49 ’s list of top scorers for this season			0
ahead of their meeting at the @entity54 next week the @entity55 has 32 goals – two more than @entity0			2
ever since @entity0 collected his third @entity57 in january and announced to the world that he was ‘ coming for ’ @entity47 who has four @entity60 awards , things have worked in reverse for the planet ’s two finest players			2
@entity0 nicks the ball past @entity43 's @entity66 but he did n't stay behind at the end to applaud the fans this acrobatic @entity0 volley was headed off the line , before @entity12 fired in the rebound to make it 1 - 0 @entity73 was more motivated - @entity74 @entity47 was 12 goals behind @entity0 last december but he has not been able to stop scoring since the turn of the year and @entity9 ’s @entity78 striker has dried up			1
‘ @entity0 was lively because he made the first goal and the second			0
he did n’t score but he contributed a lot , ’ said @entity74 after the game			0
@entity0 hardly cracked a smile when celebrating with team - mate @entity84 the frustration was written all over @entity0 's face as he leaned against the frame of the goal and he did n't look a happy chappy sitting on the pitch during his side 's @entity49 victory the @entity94 coach said he had no reason not to be positive ahead of next week ’s @entity10 and admitted : ‘ @entity12 was more motivated than usual and the presence of [ @entity99 ] @entity98 helps him			1
they know each other very well from playing together at @entity102			0
' he will need his talisman ronaldo back in the right frame of mind before the game however			0
last week @entity0 had to be dragged to the centre - circle by captain @entity108 , on sunday night he ducked out of the post match tradition altogether			0
at least next week ’s league deciding showdown is away from home .			0
