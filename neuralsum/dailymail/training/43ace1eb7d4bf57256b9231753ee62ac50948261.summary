by @entity1 reporter a quarter of parents said that work pressures meant they were too busy to read a bedtime story to their child @entity9 , story , then bed – so goes the traditional evening routine for children			1
but a study revealed yesterday that one in five parents do n’t read a bedtime story to their children			1
a quarter of those parents said that work pressures meant they were too busy – but eight per cent confessed that they just find the ritual boring			2
14 per cent are n't usually at home when their child goes to bed , while another one in 20 per cent admit they simply ca n't be bothered			0
and now the trend is to swipe and scroll through their favourite book rather than turn the pages – as one in four children are now more likely to read their bedtime story on a tablet or e-reader than in a printed book			2
but the gadgets may actually be helping children to read with more than half of parents claiming their offspring would be more likely to read if they could do so with an e-reader or tablet			1
researchers also found that 42 per cent of parents are worried about whether their child spends enough time reading , with 92 per cent believing it 's important to read with their child			2
the study of 2,000 parents was commissioned by the film @entity52 to mark its release on dvd			1
it also found that of those parents who do read to children before bed , most will stop the routine once their child reaches the age of seven – with 17 per cent admitting they stop before they even start school			1
a spokesman for @entity52 said : ' for most families , the bedtime routine would n't be complete without a story or two before tucking the children in			0
' but in today 's busy society , it seems this part of the day is sometimes hard to find time for			0
one in four children are now more likely to read their bedtime story on a tablet or e-reader than in a book ' we are busier than ever before with many young families having to work around two working parents , school or nursery schedules and clubs or sports of older children			1
' the bedtime story is an important part of childhood			0
in our busy lives , it gives you a great bit of time to really sit down with no distractions for some quality time at the end of the day			0
' it is also an important introduction to books and story time for young children and hopefully something they will continue to do as they get older			0
