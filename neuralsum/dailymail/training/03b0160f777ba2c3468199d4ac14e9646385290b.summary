by @entity0 @entity1 : 09:34 est , 10 december 2013 @entity2 : 11:45 est , 10 december 2013 @entity3 has reportedly attempted to silence a customer whose @entity6 smartphone dangerously caught fire			1
the @entity10 group ’s actions have , however , backfired after the customer used social media to highlight the company 's response			2
earlier this month , @entity17 user @entity15 posted a video that showed the damage caused to his @entity6 handset after it caught fire while charging			1
‘ and then the smell of smoke , fire and destruction			2
’ ‘ thank @entity32 the battery did n’t go ' , he added			0
‘ anyone who knows these batteries will know , when they blow , they expand and just explode			0
and when they do it 's just molten fire			2
’ although the battery did not explode , @entity42 ’s phone was destroyed and so he contacted @entity3 for a replacement			1
warning : video contains strong language earlier this month , @entity17 user @entity15 ( right ) posted a video that showed the damage caused to his @entity6 ( left ) handset when it caught fire while charging but instead of providing one , the customer claims @entity3 ordered him to remove the video from @entity17 before it would replace the handset			1
the letter , which can be read here , read : ‘ as a condition of exchanging the phone with a similar model , * * * agrees to remove his @entity17 video or any other link or statement relating to these matters and refrain from making other videos or statements about or relating to the matters set out herein			1
’ @entity3 's letter also demanded that @entity42 not disclose the settlement details			1
video : @entity42 reveals @entity3 's letter this approach backfired , however , as @entity3 's letter now has had over 270,000 views and @entity42 's video has racked up over 700,000 views			1
@entity42 ’s experience follows a series of incidents in which @entity3 phones have reportedly caught fire			1
in june this year , a fire which destroyed a @entity81 flat was thought to have started when a @entity6 burst into flames			0
the owner of the device , known only as @entity85 , said he was playing the game @entity86 when he heard a loud pop from the phone 's battery			2
he said he was so startled by the noise he instinctively threw the phone onto a sofa which promptly caught fire			1
in june , a @entity81 resident claims his flat was destroyed by fire after his @entity6 burst into flames while he was playing the game @entity97 only a month later , a @entity99 teenager suffered second and third degree burns when her smartphone apparently exploded in her pocket			0
@entity103 , 18 , was injured when the @entity104 allegedly blew up in her trouser pocket			0
in a separate incident , an @entity108 @entity107 owner claimed his handset burst into flames as he was driving his car			0
however , it was later discovered , following tests by the @entity115 ( @entity116 ) team , that the phone had been previously placed in the microwave to remove water damage and this may have been the cause of the fire			2
in july , a @entity99 teenager suffered burns when her smartphone apparently exploded in her pocket according to reports in the @entity127 - language @entity126 newspaper , 18 - year - old ms @entity103 was working as an apprentice painter when her smartphone exploded in the pocket of her work trousers , pictured it is n't just the @entity107 and @entity6 model that has this supposed fault either			0
in @entity10 in 2011 , the battery from a @entity135 allegedly exploded in a man 's pocket as he walked along the street			0
the explosion caused second degree burns and a one - inch wound to his thigh			0
it was the second time that year a battery from the @entity135 was said to have exploded in @entity10			0
elsewhere , a phone battery spontaneously caught fire in a man 's back pocket at the @entity151 hacking conference in the @entity152 in 2010 , and in 2009 , a man was killed when his exploding phone severed his neck artery .			1

@entity17 user @entity15 *uploaded* a video of his phone after it caught fire
