passport controls could be required at @entity4 's border with @entity5 if it becomes independent in order to comply with @entity8 law , @entity1 's @entity0 has warned			1
a separate @entity4 would need to negotiate its own opt - out from the @entity10 , which allows for free travel between 25 @entity8 states , according to @entity13			1
the agreement could pose ' a clear problem ' should @entity4 gain independence from @entity5 , he said			0
' @entity19 problem ' : @entity13 , @entity1 's @entity0 , said the @entity10 would create a challenge for @entity4 's border control if they gain independence @entity1 's decision to opt out of the @entity10 means that other @entity8 citizens are still subject to passport checks on our borders because is outside the @entity30 free travel area			1
however , if @entity4 gains independence it will - as an @entity8 member state - automatically be part of the agreement and will have to negotiate its own withdrawal which must be approved by every other member state , it was reported			2
if it does n't , passport controls would need to be set up at the border because @entity10 bans free @entity30 travel between those who are part of the agreement , and those who are not			0
mr @entity44 said - during a visit to the @entity46 in @entity47 - that there were no guarantees @entity4 could choose to withdraw from the agreement			0
opt - out : @entity1 's withdrawal from the agreement means it maintains a tighter control of its borders he said opt - outs from the single currency and free travel area ' require not just a bilateral agreement between the @entity1 and an independent @entity4 , it would require the agreement of all of the other member states as well '			1
he told the @entity64 : ' the fact the @entity1 has an opt - out from @entity10 means that we are able to maintain the border controls that you do n't often have on the borders between @entity10 countries			2
' previously , the @entity73 's president , @entity72 , warned that no more countries would be able to opt - out of the single currency			0
a spokesman for @entity77 - the @entity78 leader - said that the ' scaremongering ' stories were demonstrably untrue , adding : ' they are insulting to @entity4 , and the only effect they are having is to boost support for independence			0

@entity4 will need to negotiate its own opt - out of agreement allowing free travel between @entity8 countries
passport checks could become mandatory because @entity1 is not part of the travel zone
@entity95 will need approval from all other @entity8 states
