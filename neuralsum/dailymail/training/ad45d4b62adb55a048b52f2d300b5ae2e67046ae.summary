it 's all the fault of the @entity1			2
since the good ladies of @entity4 stripped off for charity in 1999 , the public has been assailed by a flood of naked calendars			0
we 've seen naked firemen , semi-clad carpenters , stripped butchers , bare bakers - in all probability , there is a calendar somewhere that features a bunch of unclothed candlestick makers , coyly covering their bits with tapers			1
now , we have the ladies of the @entity21 , who have just launched their own black and white effort			0
and it 's quite possibly the worst yet			2
the girls of the @entity26 get their kit off for january as a man - a coach , perhaps ? - checks their studs team manager @entity30 said : ' we 're pleased with the way it came out ; we wanted it to be fun and tasteful ' the all - female team got their kit off to raise money for their club			1
perhaps keen to save pennies , they appear to have neglected to engage the services of a professional photographer and shot the pictures in a dingy pub and what appears to be their club changing rooms			0
lighting is also an issue			0
no - one looks good under a harsh , fluorescent bulb , least of all a naked rugby prop forward			1
the girls are seen sprawled over pool tables and a sticky - looking bar top in the grotty drinking den. in a grimy corridor one girl is laid out on a stretcher in almost complete darkness whilst four other semi-clad ladies surround her			0
in one particularly disturbing scene , the girls are posed with bottoms facing camera as a man lurks in the gloom , bending down to check their boots			0
may features a line of smiling lovelies - rugby boots at the ready , naturally			2
spoilsport locals have asked the girls not to release a calendar for 2015 ' i think it 's a brave thing that they 've done but they ca n't seriously think it looks any good , ' says disgruntled local resident , @entity79 , 43 a female member of the team , based in @entity82 , @entity83 , is stretchered off , as smiling team mates cover themselves in the strip - lit corridoor not that the team , based in @entity82 , @entity83 , thought that there was anything wrong with the calendar			1
team manager @entity30 said : ' we 're pleased with the way it came out ; we wanted it to be fun and tasteful			1
' however not everyone agrees			0
' i think it 's a brave thing that they 've done but they ca n't seriously think it looks any good , ' said local resident , @entity79 , 43			0
the women 's team , known as the @entity103 , did the calendar to raise money for their club			1
' we 're a self - funded club and there 's no money in women 's rugby so we need to be inventive when fund - raising , ' said @entity30 , the team manager ' maybe if they had hired a professional to do the pictures and not picked their local pub as the location it would n't look so bloody terrible			1

' i think we 've seen enough of them to last a lifetime			0
' february perches winsomely on the bar , clutching a ball , and again wearing just rugby socks the girls cram in to the jacuzzi to mark the month of october one grumpy neighbour commented : ' maybe if they had hired a professional to do the pictures and not picked their local pub as the location - it would n't look so bloody terrible ' the girls of @entity21 in @entity82 , @entity83 have raised eyebrows in their neighbourhood , with some saying they 've seen rather too much of the ladies march sees the girls on their shorts , rugby socks pulled up to their knees - and not much else !			2

the women have been photographed nude to raise money for the club
