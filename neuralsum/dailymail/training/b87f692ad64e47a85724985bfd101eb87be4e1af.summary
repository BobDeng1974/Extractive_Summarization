she does n’t seem to like the ubiquitous children ’s entertainment company ’s notion of beauty , but an artist recently used her impressive drawing skills to illustrate everything that goes into creating a @entity9 princess			1
say hello to the @entity10 , a step - by - step guide to building the perfect @entity9 princess			1
posted to @entity13 by user @entity14 , the guide , as it were , opens with question			1
who 's the fairest ? @entity13 user oceanstarlet , aka @entity19 , posted a tongue - in - cheek but highly educational tutorial on drawing @entity9 princesses ‘ ever wanted to draw a @entity9 - style chick , but she ended up looking like a deformed @entity26 bobblehead ? ’ if so , @entity27 can solve your problems			1
in what may or may not be a jab at @entity9 ’s uncommonly perfect and anatomically unattainable take on a young woman ’s bodily and facial proportions , the artist uses her tutorial to guide the viewer through each and every facet of the @entity9 princess ’s person that she believes makes them too good to be true all while showing exactly how bring them to life figured it out : tips include not giving your princess hips or muscles of any kind			1
and the result is highly believable first on @entity27 ’s check list is the @entity9 princess body type			2
in a comparison with what she calls a regular woman ’s figure , the @entity9 example of @entity54 — the princess from @entity56 — looks toothpick thin and waistless with feet that are ‘ absolute - positive - lutely tiny			1
’ @entity63 is also part of being in the @entity65 , and according to @entity27 , @entity66 has timeless beauty down to a science			0
‘ want to see their idea of a matured woman , ’ she writes beside a picture of a childlike empress			2
‘ look at @entity66 , thirteen years after having her first kid , and at least thirty			0
lookin ’ good , @entity76 @entity66			0
’ after bodies , @entity27 moves on to faces and starts with what she calls the ‘ @entity82 ’ girls			0
eurocentric : caucasian princesses are distinct from the ' exotic ' ones , and @entity19 says most notably that the white girls all basically look the same ‘ “ sugar cookie " is definitely not an official @entity9 term , ’ @entity27 writes on her @entity13 page			1
‘ it 's my name for all the @entity91 @entity9 princesses			0
they are a lot like sugar cookies : sparkly , white , and too sweet for their own good			0
’ the @entity97 girls , most notably , seem to have ‘ bulbous ’ eyes pupils and full , womanly lips regardless of age			2
‘ the reason for the ginormous eyes , ’ she writes , ‘ is that it makes them look more child - like … the concept here is a little girl head on a teenager ’s body with adult height ( freaky ! ) ’ picasso gals : meanwhile , @entity19 shows how face , eye , and nose shape are all the differences needed to make the perfect ' exotic ' princess @entity27 then moves one to the ‘ @entity122 ’ girls , which she says began in 1992 ‘ when @entity9 discovered that there were more stories to be told outside @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 , and @entity128			1
’ these ‘ exotic beauties ’ include ‘ @entity130 @entity9 , ’ ‘ @entity131 , ’ ‘ @entity132 , ’ all with detailed drawing how - tos			2
by the end of the tutorial , @entity27 accomplishes the impressive task of simultaneously educating her reader about @entity9 ’s unrealistic beauty standards and exactly how to achieve them			0
at least on paper .			0
