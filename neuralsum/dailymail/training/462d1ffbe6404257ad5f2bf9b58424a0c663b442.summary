i 'm not taking a chance on him being part of my daughter 's life and with @entity16 everything is extreme - it 's all or nothing			1
so it has to be nothing			0
' we 're fighting this through court and i think that in two to three months we should have @entity22 with us			2
' @entity22 , he said , was the product of a one - night stand with her mother , and the two did not have any sort of longer term relationship			1

he vehemently denies the allegations which did not result in any charges being brought			0
@entity7 is not a presence in her daughter 's life anymore he claims			1
@entity1 does not know for sure what arrangement she and @entity1 came to when he and @entity164 fought for custody			2
according to @entity1 she got a second hand @entity167 , with 200,000 miles on the clock but he is not clear what she gave up in exchange			2
he said , ' i was on drugs at the time [ she was conceived ]			0
at my worst i would do it all day every day			0
' in an episode showing the family 's @entity180 preparations , @entity1 's children posed for a photograph - all but @entity1 who was not there and was barely mentioned			1
when he was mentioned , it was by @entity186 who explained , ' my eldest son @entity1 has had some difficulty in his life which is unfortunately as a result of @entity1 doing drugs			1
we still struggle with this			0
we 've been dealing with this since 2009			0
' does it bother me now as much as it did then ? yes it does bother me			0
how do you deal with that ? ' he added , ' @entity1 is not interacting with his family on a daily basis so right now @entity22 has to be with us			1

' but was adamant that his problems were in the past and angry at his father 's continued depiction of him as a user , unfit to be a parent			2
he said , ' i have been clean now for more than a year			2
every one is clean - urine which is instant and hair follicle which goes back six months			2
' but for @entity1 , his father 's refusal to acknowledge just how far his eldest son has come , is all about control and the complex emotional and legal ties that binds them together and stand between him and custody of @entity22			1
bride : @entity16 's first wife @entity13 says she knows how dark the reality behind @entity1 knows best really is			1
@entity13 was 19 and @entity16 was 21 when she became pregnant with daughter @entity74 and the couple married behind the smiles : @entity13 and @entity16 hold daughter @entity74 and son @entity1 he explained , ' five years ago he took out a legal guardianship on me			1
and five years ago i do believe that if he would n't have got it i would probably be in the ground by now because i was that bad on drugs			0
' i was 130lbs - i 'm 180lbs today - i looked like i was starving			0
i could have died plenty times			0
' but , he continued , ' at that same time i do n't see how any sort of judge could have signed off on the guardianship that he got			0
' at 18 it should have been a medical guardianship so if they see me on drugs or relapsing or having mental health issues you can intervene and send me to a treatment facility			0
' but no , he got a guardianship and every box you can mark he marked it			0
ca n't sign a legal document , ca n't contract to get married , ca n't do this , ca n't do that			0
and so i have monitored custody of @entity22 but he can do what he likes really			2
i see her for 30 or 40 minutes with everyone there			0
interviewed : the full talk with @entity7 can be read in this issue of @entity273 ' he puts a curfew on that she has to be back by 6 o'clock			2
or he just ups and goes to @entity277 with her			0
the picture @entity1 paints of his father is a very different one from the ultimately caring , if overbearing , patriarch on screen			2
but it is not a world away from the one shared by his mother , @entity13 , 43 , when she broke her silence of 20 years and spoke to @entity101			0
she is another figure from @entity1 's life who did n't really fit with in the court of @entity1 and was airbrushed out of history when the family was introduced to the public in season one			2
she is mother to both @entity74 and @entity1			2

in court documents his ex-wife accused him of ' waging a campaign of mental and physical abuse ' against her			0
