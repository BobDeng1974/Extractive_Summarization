information security expert @entity17 , 58 , said he was baffled as to why they were left outside the home he shares with wife @entity32			2
he said : ' my neighbour came over and told me a large number of ' dubious ' dvds called ' @entity6 ' had been left outside my house			1
' they were all rated 18 , so it was clear they were not going to contain photographs of door furniture			2
' we scooped them all up and handed them over to the police but i think some passers - by had already taken a copy for their private collection			2
shocked residents quickly gathered up the discs in a bid to stop children from seeing them as they walked to a nearby school ' my wife put one of the discs into our dvd player and informs me it is a film about three women with rather large breasts			1
' the other dvd , called @entity13 , had a chap with his trousers down who was clearly ready to get it on with a young woman			1
' @entity32 did n't get past the title screen on either disc and i have n't seen any of them			0
' we are not easily shocked but i 'm sure some people would find them quite filthy			0
' it 's a well - to - do , respectable area with elderly residents who would be appalled by the contents			1
' @entity32 , 51 , was worried they might be picked up by children as they walked past the house to school			0
she said : ' we 've had a bit of a giggle over it			0
it 's kind of funny but serious at the same time			1

around 100 copies of the 18 - rated film , called @entity6 , were dumped in @entity21 in @entity22 and were spread along the verge and pavement it is presumed the other @entity6 discs feature the same content although they have not all been viewed			2
