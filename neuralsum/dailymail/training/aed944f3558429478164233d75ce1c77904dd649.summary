but aides of the doughty 92 - year - old were quick to explain it was not a permanent feature			0
the @entity11 ’s husband , who has spent the summer recuperating at @entity12 after undergoing abdominal surgery in june , was visiting volunteers restoring a rare bog on her @entity17 estate in @entity18			1
back on form : the @entity1 returned to his public duties today with a visit to a conservation project at the @entity24 , on the @entity25 , @entity18 on the mend : prince @entity1 's return to health comes after he spent the summer recuperating at @entity12 after abdominal surgery in june ‘ it was the kind of staff used quite frequently by those engaged in countryside pursuits , particularly when walking across uneven terrain , ’ said one			1
‘ it is not something that the @entity1 uses often			2
’ indeed , @entity1 appeared in fine fettle as he chatted animatedly with the conservationists at @entity24 , a national nature reserve covering more than 400 acres , which is one of the last remaining fragments of lowland heathland in south - east @entity44			0
the workers were from @entity46 ( @entity46 ) , a national charity which encourages people and communities to transform their health , prospects and outdoor places by getting involved with projects			0
@entity1 is the organisation ’s patron and watched as the volunteers worked at coppicing , rhododendron clearing and restoration work on the mire			1

from next week the prince , who normally undertakes some 300 plus public visits each year , will once again take up a full programme of engagements			0
the ageing royal was admitted to @entity79 in early june - his fourth hospitalisation in just 18 months - where he underwent what @entity81 described as an ‘ exploratory operation following abdominal investigations ’			0
he was released 10 days later and although staff have refused to discuss the result of the tests citing medical confidentiality , they made clear he would require at least two months recuperation			0
