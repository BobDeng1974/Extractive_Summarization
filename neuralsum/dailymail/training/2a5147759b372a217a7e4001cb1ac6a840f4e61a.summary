by @entity0 published : 04:06 est , 8 november 2012 updated : 04:29 est , 8 november 2012 astronomers have discovered a planet orbiting a nearby sun at just the right distance for an @entity6 - like climate that could support life			1
the planet , which orbits a star 42 light years away , sits in the so - called @entity10 , the band around a sun where temperatures are neither too hot nor too cold for liquid water to exist			1
' @entity15 is a perfectly quiet old dwarf star , so there is no reason why such a planet could not sustain an @entity6 - like climate , ' said @entity21 from @entity23 's @entity22			1
@entity24 : this artist 's impression shows @entity27 in the foreground ( on the left hand side ) , with its host star @entity30 and two other planets in the system ( on the right - hand side ) dr @entity21 led the research alongside @entity36 at the @entity37			1
it is one of three super-earth type planets recently discovered orbiting @entity41 , doubling the number of known planets in that system to six			1
of the new planets , the one of greatest interest is the one with the outermost orbit from the star			2
the planet has a mass at least seven times that of @entity6 but it orbits at about the same distance from its sun , meaning it receives a similar amount of solar energy as @entity6 gets - increasing chances it may be habitable			1
more than 800 planets have been discovered outside our solar system since the first was detected in the early @entity61 , but only a handful of those have been in the habitable zone			2
even more rare are planets in the zone that rotate , as this one does , to create a day - time and night - time , which increases the chance of an @entity6 - like environment			1
asteroid belts like the one in our own solar system may be the key to tracking down life elsewhere in the universe , a new theory proposes			0
an emerging view proposes that asteroid collisions with planets may provide a boost to the birth and evolution of complex , intelligent life			0
this might sound surprising ; asteroids are generally known - and feared for - for their potential to trigger mass extinctions after catastrophic impacts with our own planet			2
however , according to the theory of punctuated equilibrium , occasional asteroid impacts might accelerate the rate of evolution by disrupting ecosystems to the point where species must find new adaptation strategies			0
those that do n't spin are said to be tidally locked , with one half in constant darkness			0
' this is the closest one to @entity6 in a habitable zone that is not tidally locked , ' @entity37 astronomer @entity106 said			2
' the longer orbit of the new planet means that its climate and atmosphere may be just right to support life			0
' just as @entity114 liked her porridge to be neither too hot nor too cold but just right , this planet , or indeed any moons that it has , lie in an orbit comparable to @entity6 , increasing the probability of it being habitable			1
' the planet , named @entity125 , is part of a system that was previously thought to have just three planets , all in orbits too close to the star to support liquid water			1
the astronomers made the discovery , unveiled in a research paper in the journal @entity136 , by examining data from the @entity139 spectrograph , attached to a @entity141 telescope at @entity142 in @entity145 's @entity144 desert			0
the @entity139 device is able to pick up tiny changes in the colour of the light coming from a host star as it wobbles under the gravitational influence of orbiting planets			1
the team used a novel technique to filter out signals caused by the host star itself			0
' we pioneered new data analysis techniques including the use of the wavelength as a filter to reduce the influence of activity on the signal from this star , ' said @entity36			0
' this significantly increased our sensitivity and enabled us to reveal three new planets around the star			2
' @entity172 , also of the @entity37 , who leads the @entity174 network , under the auspices of which research was carried out , commented : ' discoveries like this are really exciting			0
' such systems will be natural targets for the next generation of large telescopes , both on the ground and in space			0

@entity15 *40307g* is one of three newly found planets orbiting the same star
the planet orbits a ' quiet old dwarf star ' as part of a six planet system
seven times the mass of @entity6 , it is just as far from its star as our world
