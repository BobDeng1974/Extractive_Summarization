she 's famous for her glossy chestnut locks but it seems that pregnancy has been taking its toll on the @entity5 's beauty regime			1
touring the @entity8 with her hair in an elegant half - up hairstyle , a glimpse of grey could be seen peeping from beneath the knot holding it in place			1
of course , this is not the first time the 33 - year - old royal has been snapped showing off a silver streak , with the most recent sighting coming early in january during a shopping trip			1
hair dye is one such beauty essential often given a wide berth by mothers - to - be , although celebrity hairstylist @entity40 says going without is n't always required			2
' although colouring your hair does n't affect pregnancy and there is no need to avoid it , some people do worry about the consequences , ' she explained in an interview with @entity49			2
' nevertheless , if someone is concerned , there are different techniques that can be used to avoid touching the scalp			0
' for example , if they have an all over tint , they could revert to highlights			0
alternatively , they could use a colour gloss that would add more depth and tone to the hair as well as enhancing the shine and condition			2
' hidden : while little could be seen from the front , the back of her head showed off a set of grey roots @entity73 blue coat with wide lapels buy a similar style at @entity76 buy now @entity22 of @entity23 is paying a visit to the @entity79 factory in @entity80 - on - @entity81 today to inspect some charity pottery			1
and as expected , she looked as pretty as the prints on the plates ! she always dresses for the occasion ( remember her boat print dress for her @entity88 visit last week ? perfect ! ) , and today she showed off her baby bump in a print dress from @entity91 with a blue coat by @entity73			1
blue for a boy , perhaps ... ? it ’s been a busy few weeks for @entity5 , and we ’ve had plenty of opportunities to see what ’s in her maternity wardrobe the second time around			1
of course , @entity91 has featured highly , as well as some old favourites like @entity102			0
but when it comes to coats , @entity73 is a must ! no doubt the @entity106 managed to fit in a spot of shopping whilst at the factory , and it 's a good excuse for us to follow suit			0
everything she touches turns to gold , so you ’d better be quick off the mark if you want to copy @entity5 ! there 's a similar light blue @entity73 coat in the sale at @entity122 ( click right ) , or check out the options we 've found for you on the high street			1
@entity128 & @entity129 lazy cocoon coat at @entity130 ( reduced to £ 135 ) buy now @entity131 at @entity132 buy now @entity133 oversized cocoon coat buy now @entity135 at @entity136 buy now @entity137 buy now slip : the @entity22 ' chic up - do inadvertently showed off a glimpse of grey on either side of her ponytail not that @entity40 is giving expectant mothers a license to go mad in the salon : ' we would always recommend seeking advice from a specialist before booking an appointment , ' she warns			1
official @entity151 advice agrees , with the health service website explaining that the chemicals involved ' are not highly toxic ' and concluding that it is safe to dye your hair while pregnant			2
' most research , although limited , shows that it ’s safe to colour your hair while pregnant , ' the advice continues			0
' some studies have found that very high doses of the chemicals in hair dyes may cause harm			0
' however , these doses are massive compared to the very low amount of chemicals a woman is exposed to when colouring her hair			0
' celebrity hair stylist @entity172 adds : ' i recommend vegetable dye and colour glosses to my clients when they 're expecting			0
' they 're safe and take them through those months with a gentle solution to keeping roots at bay			0
' not the first time : @entity22 was pictured with grey hair while out shopping in early january horrified : @entity22 was reportedly less than impressed with these 2013 photos that showed some greys increasingly common : @entity22 began noticing greys while preparing for her first pregnancy ( right ) @entity22 herself is no stranger to hair dye and reportedly booked an emergency appointment with colourist @entity190 after unflattering photos of her greys were published in november 2013			1
according to witnesses , @entity5 left his salon ' looking amazing ' and her locks appearing ' big and glossy ' after a £ 600 six - hour session with the @entity199 stylist			2
but like many 30 - something women , greys have become an increasingly regular occurrence for @entity5 , with friends saying the @entity22 first noticed hers in the run - up to her first pregnancy			1
to combat these , she had organic vegetable - based dye and subtle low - lights applied during regular four - hour visits to the @entity209 and @entity210 in @entity211			0
but , like the rest of us , she ca n't prevent further greying as she ages			0
not , say stylists , that going silver is always a bad thing			0
' going grey marks nature ’s way of softening the hair colour giving natural highlights as the skin pigmentation changes , ' says celebrity stylist @entity224 ' i always recommend using a semi-permanent colour with no ammonia or peroxide , to blend the grey hair and tone it down slightly			2
' chemical - free : @entity5 has reportedly given up anything that involves chemicals during pregnancy not long to go : although the @entity151 says hair dye is ok during pregnancy , @entity5 has chosen not to risk it			1
