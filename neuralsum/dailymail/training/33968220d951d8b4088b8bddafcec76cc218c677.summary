danger threatens @entity1 in the discontent that is starting to build around the management of @entity4			1
the wheels of dissent are grinding audibly now and the noise may yet grow louder in march and april when @entity1 ’s fixtures get tougher			1
it is important that @entity1 hold their nerve and show resolve this time in a way they failed to do when @entity13 was buckling under the pressure of trying to keep the club in the bright light where sir @entity17 had camped them for more than 20 years			1
curing @entity1 is going to take time			1
the penny should have dropped by now that there is no quick fix , not even if you spend £ 150 million on new players in the summer			2
you need patience and you need a man like @entity27 whose self - confidence knows no limits			2
@entity4 is self - assured and @entity1 must back him to avoid falling further into the malaise @entity13 was blamed for the fall of an empire , but @entity1 's problems are complex and deep - rooted @entity34 is bowling every ball as if fuelled by the desire to honour the memory of his dead friend @entity38 @entity40 's humiliation : outbatted , outbowled and out - thought … @entity42 's men off to nightmare start @entity44 : mail on sunday 's chief sports writer on @entity46 , @entity47 and whether @entity48 is better than @entity49 the first step towards rehabilitation and the return to greatness that @entity1 ’s fans crave is to finish in the top four this season , but they are locked in an increasingly tense struggle with @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 for the last two places			1
it is possible they wo n’t make it and if that happens , strident voices will scream about the money @entity27 has spent and the uninspiring football @entity1 have played and demand that he is sacked			1
@entity1 ’s performance in the victory over @entity72 on wednesday , as so often this season , was anxious and uncertain			1
their defence seemed bewildered by the movement of @entity76			2
their opponents were unlucky not to get more out of the game , another familiar trend under @entity27			2
@entity1 are not winning any friends with their style as they cling to third place , trailing in the wake of @entity84 and @entity85			1
but let ’s get one thing straight : the very last thing that @entity1 should do in the summer , whether they make the top four or not , is to get rid of @entity27			1
it would not help their cause			2
in fact , it would deal a serious blow to their hopes of recovering their pre-eminence			1
it is not @entity27 ’s fault that @entity1 offered him the job knowing that he would not be able to start until last july because of his commitments with @entity100			1
@entity27 's success at the @entity102 meant the @entity103 arrived at @entity104 later than anticipated the movement and pace of @entity72 striker @entity76 tormented @entity1 in midweek it is not @entity27 ’s fault that the result was a late - summer super-market trolley dash that involved a panic signing like @entity112			1
it is not his fault that @entity112 has been a shadow of the predatory , prolific striker he once was			2
or that @entity118 is having another poor season			0
or that @entity1 have been struck down by an epidemic of injuries			1
@entity118 has struggled to recreate the form which made him one of the world 's best strikers the handsomely - paid @entity112 is a shadow of his former self and has struggled in @entity40 or that a welter of expensive signings were rushed into the team and expected to adapt immediately to each other and to the @entity40 game			0
or that the club are so short of defenders he has had to play swathes of the season with novices like @entity138 and @entity139			0
or that @entity1 had failed to fill the vacuum of authority in central midfield by the time he arrived and that , in the absence of the injured @entity146 , @entity144 has often been the only creative option			1
@entity138 ( left ) was rewarded with a new deal to keep him at the @entity104 club until at least 2017 @entity139 has been called up to the @entity151 and is expected to be rewarded with a new deal none of it his fault			2
in fact , @entity27 has done a remarkable job of husbanding his resources and keeping @entity1 in the top four			1
the club were right to sack @entity13 , even if events have proved that those who believed the @entity163 was the reason for all @entity1 ’s travails badly misread the scale of the rebuilding job @entity17 left behind			1
it was obvious by then , even to @entity13 ’s allies , that the job was too much for him , that he was paralysed by the scrutiny and the expectation that came with being in charge of one of the world ’s biggest clubs			2
@entity27 wobbled last week , too			0
his ‘ i have in my hand a piece of paper ’ speech was fleetingly reminiscent of the wide - eyed territory @entity182 and @entity183 have led us into in the past			0
but @entity27 is made of sterner stuff			0
for the most part , he has seemed utterly at ease with being boss and undaunted by the task of leading @entity1 back to the summit of @entity40 football			1
he does things his way , without regard for the court of public opinion			0
whether that is playing three at the back or utilising @entity144 in the centre of midfield , he is not swayed by the criticism of others			2
@entity27 produced a dossier full of stats in a lively press conference after @entity209 's ' long - ball ' jibe @entity182 's tortured @entity40 reign is best characterised by the 1994 documentary ' @entity212 ' after @entity183 's ' i would love it ' rant after defeat to @entity220 in 1996 , @entity214 's grip on the title slipped this is a man , after all , who has managed @entity223 and @entity224			0
he is no stranger to the heightened tensions being in charge at super-clubs bring			0
i interviewed him in the late nineties when he was under siege at the @entity231			0
when i came out of his office , @entity233 journalists were eager for any information i could give			0
@entity27 was not talking to them			0
let ’s not forget that even though he has been forced to blood @entity139 and @entity138 , the back line has conceded fewer goals than anyone other than @entity84 and @entity57			2
it might not be sexy but it is progress			0
let ’s also not forget that they finished seventh last season and were in disarray with a squad that looked threadbare			0
@entity249 was shot to pieces			0
a raft of new signings was desperately needed			0
@entity27 's short stint at @entity104 has already been an eventful one , but the club must stick with him under @entity27 , @entity1 have a habit of winning when not playing well and currently lie in third place @entity27 won the @entity259 with @entity260 in 1995 and domestic titles in @entity100 , @entity262 and @entity263 despite their troubles , @entity1 lie third in the league things are better			1
this may surprise you given the negativity that is being aimed at @entity27 but over the last 15 @entity272 games , @entity1 have won more points than anyone , with 34			1
@entity84 are next best with 33			0
as @entity27 takes the flak , @entity1 are on a better run than anyone			1
the club are moving in the right direction with a manager who knows what steps he has to make and is not overwhelmed by what lies ahead			0
if they stick with him , they will continue the journey back to the summit			1
if they do n’t , @entity1 will be plunged back into chaos			1
time to ditch the greed the @entity272 have secured a new £ 5.1billion television deal and our great behemoth has grown even bigger			1
for some , the deal has confirmed their view that @entity40 football represents all that is meretricious about our society			2
others suggest the country should be proud of the @entity272 , as if it were a sister to the @entity297 or a brother to the works of @entity300			1
i ’m proud of it , i suppose			0
i ’m proud of the football it produces and the entertainment it brings			0
and , yes , the joy the @entity40 take in sport and the loyalty we show in our support of sport have become things that help to define us			2
our modern football clubs also contribute much to their local communities : @entity85 ’s regeneration of a hitherto neglected swathe of the eastern side of the city has brought new jobs and new facilities for local people			2
@entity85 spent £ 200m regenerating a dilapidated part of the city to build a stunning training complex the new television deal will see over £ 5bn pumped into the national game , but clubs must show benevolence but i would be more proud of the @entity272 if our elite football clubs called a halt to the relentless disenfranchisement of their traditional fan - base			1
i would be more proud if our elite clubs now used their vast wealth to reduce ticket prices			2
i would be more proud if they increased the subsidy they pay to lower league clubs , which are so important to the fabric of the game in this country			1
i would be more proud if they improved their commitment to developing more grass - roots facilities			0
they have it in their power to become enlightened despots			0
they are businesses , not charities , but they have the best chance they will ever have to choose benevolence , not greed			1
the sacking of @entity356 as the manager of @entity358 last week was a classic of its kind			0
the owner starves the club of investment , results suffer , unrest grows , the fans criticise the owner , the owner does n’t like the heat , the owner sacks the manager			0
it ’s football ’s favourite formula			0
@entity356 was given his marching orders after a lamentable run of form at relegation - haunted @entity358 the atmosphere at @entity378 soured as fans turned against @entity356 and owner @entity380 there is a poignancy about the accelerating decline of @entity384 that will survive the fact he often wore the mantle of his hegemony without charm or grace			0
@entity384 ’ curse is this : he is one of the greatest sportsmen there has ever been and yet his epitaph will be that in the chase to overhaul the record of 18 @entity397 victories set by @entity398 , he fell short			0
@entity384 ' descent into injury and loss of form culminated with the 14 - time major winner taking a break the incomparable @entity398 , who stands on 18 majors , is widely considered the finest golfer of all time			0

the wheels of dissent are grinding audibly and the noise may grow louder
it is important that @entity1 hold their nerve and show resolve
if they stick with @entity4 , they will continue journey back to summit
@entity272 clubs can choose benevolence , not greed , after the tv deal
