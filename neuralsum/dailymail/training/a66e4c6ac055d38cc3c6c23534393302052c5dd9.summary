among the issues he will seek views on will be ‘ training of officers and preparation for operations ’			1
it is the first time the judge , who was criticised in some quarters over his handling of the inquest , has spoken publicly about the case			1
‘ whatever you think of him as an individual , @entity4 was somebody ’s son , ’ said the judge at his home in @entity36 yesterday			2
‘ no one wanted him to die			0

his death sparked riots across the country			0
jurors were given special protection by police as they left the @entity49 , following the intimidation and abuse they faced from @entity15 ’s supporters during the hearing			1
a senior @entity55 commander said the scenes in court were totally unacceptable , while a leading crime prevention expert said they threatened to damage the ‘ dignity ’ of @entity61 ’s most prestigious court			0
judge @entity1 pointedly declined to respond to the criticism yesterday , but defended his decision to hold a 20 - second silence for @entity15 when the inquest began last september			1
‘ it was my idea			0
i know it was controversial , and i know the police were bristling about it and sections of the media were very critical , but i believe that @entity4 ’s death led to a great deal of unrest			0
i thought that a few moments ’ reflection at the start of the inquest might be quite healing			2
‘ i used the words “ regrettable death ” at the time and there is no doubt that ’s what it was			2
the police have said right from the start that his death was regrettable			0
‘ it ’s interesting to see that now the inquest is over the police have taken up my phrase and are using the words “ regrettable death ” as they try to reach out to @entity98 ’s family			1
that can only be a good thing			0
‘ in that sense the inquest is not quite complete , ’ he said			2
‘ i will go quiet for a while but around the middle of february i will be announcing what recommendations i have made to the secretary of state			0
shot dead : former gangster @entity4 was killed by police in 2011 ‘ normally i would hide away and come to my own conclusions about these recommendations but this has been a highly charged and high - profile case			1
i have wanted to have transparency for all the parties and the public			0
‘ in that spirit i am taking the unusual , perhaps unique , step of inviting submissions from all the interested parties including the @entity15 family			1
i ’ll wait to receive all the views before sitting down and carefully considering any recommendations that need to be made			2
‘ the obvious one , that officers wear head cameras on these types of operations , has already been put forward			2
but there will be other issues including the training of officers and preparation for operations			2
‘ i have told all the parties that i want to proceed in this way and the police have indicated they would like to hear what others have to say first before putting forward their own suggestions			0
i have no objection to that			0
’ judge @entity1 received advice during the inquest from the pr firm @entity164 , fuelling speculation that they may have played a role in the decision to open the hearing with a silence			1

in the eight years before his death he was repeatedly arrested over a succession of serious crimes , including murder , attempted murder and firearms offences			0
