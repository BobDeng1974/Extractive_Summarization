@entity0 the mother : with daughter @entity2 , 13 , last year trying to discipline your children is a challenge for any parent … especially if your spouse then undermines all your hard work by spoiling them with gifts			1
but when you have four offspring by four different fathers like @entity16 , it seems that agreeing on some basic parenting ground rules becomes virtually impossible			0
the presenter , 47 , has spoken of the ‘ nightmare ’ of controlling her children ’s internet access when her ex-lovers shower them with hi - tech gadgets and smartphones that allow them to go online whenever they like			1
@entity16 revealed that her oldest daughter @entity2 , 13 , has a mobile phone ‘ much against my better judgment ’ , while her youngest @entity29 was given an @entity30 by her father at the tender age of ten			1
and she said she was ‘ utterly horrified ’ when her eldest son @entity33 , 19 , from her first marriage to cameraman @entity35 , admitted he had watched online porn when he was just 14			1
the @entity38 - born star said she now feels incapable of protecting them from graphic and sexually explicit material on her own because it is so easy for them to access the @entity43			2
she told hello ! : ‘ in my household things have changed greatly over the last few years			0
my oldest son , who ’s nearing 20 , is capable of regulating himself			2
‘ my oldest daughter , who is about 14 , has had , much against my better judgment , an @entity30 since she was 11 and a mobile phone since she was 12			1
‘ at first her mobile was n’t a smartphone but times have moved on and so , it appears , has she			0
‘ my ten - year - old daughter was given an @entity30 by her father last @entity54 , and my six - year - old boy can access the family ipad			2
’ @entity16 married her third husband , advertising executive @entity57 , in 2008			0

but she admitted she wished she had started worrying about the issue many years ago			0
she said : ‘ four years ago , none of the nightmares of policing my children ’ s access existed			2
but they should have done because my 19 - year - old confessed to me last year that he had viewed porn on the internet when he was about 14			1
the presenter , 49 , said she feels incapable of protecting her children from graphic and sexually explicit material online ( file photo ) ‘ i was utterly horrified and felt a fool for being too trusting and not savvy enough			1
’ @entity16 said the only influence she has over her children is to inform them about the risks of the @entity43 , but said she was unable to stop @entity2 setting up a @entity91 account of her own accord			1
she said : ‘ when we found out , she was made to understand in no uncertain terms why she could n’t have one and why we need to know what she does on the @entity43			0
’ @entity16 added : ‘ i , alone , can not protect them from everything , including the content they have at their fingertips and which they absorb unwittingly			0
