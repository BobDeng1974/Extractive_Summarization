@entity0 visit @entity1 on sunday afternoon with both sides desperate for the win to reignite their @entity5 campaigns and push back towards the @entity7 places			1
@entity9 ’s side return to @entity10 to the scene of last season ’s humiliating 5 - 1 drubbing at the hands of a @entity15 inspired @entity1			2
the 20 year - old has already become an integral member of @entity1 and @entity18 ’s side , featuring 58 times so far for club and country in 2014 whereas @entity0 have a new talisman lighting up the league in @entity25 international @entity24 , but who has the edge ahead of the @entity10 battle ? @entity0 forward @entity24 has already scored nine goals in the @entity5 this season @entity15 scores @entity1 's opening goal against @entity31 in the @entity32 on wednesday it ’s evident both rapid forwards have become the key man in their respective sides with @entity24 adding fresh impetus to @entity0 ’s attack since his £ 30million summer move from @entity40			1
in 15 @entity5 appearances so far for the @entity42 has impressed with his dogged work rate but has also found the back of the net nine times			0
compare this to @entity15 , who has n’t scored a league goal since september , and @entity24 ’s attacking efficiency becomes even more prevalent with a 32 per cent goals - to - shot ratio for the @entity51 with @entity15 well off on 13 per cent			2
here 's is the @entity5 table before the fixtures on sunday , with @entity0 five points clear of @entity1 @entity24 ( centre ) celebrates with teammates after scoring in @entity0 's 1 - 0 win over @entity59 despite an indifferent start to the season , @entity9 ’s side have only lost one of their last six matches in all competitions and this coincides with @entity24 ’s recent flourishing form			1
the 26 - year - old has scored seven and assisted four of @entity0 's last 17 league goals at 65 per cent involvement , which underlines his importance as the spearhead of the @entity51 attack			1
@entity15 scored twice in the 5 - 1 thrashing of @entity0 in this fixture last season and with the departure of @entity80 , persistent injuries for @entity82 and lack of form from summer purchases , the 20 - year - old has become the focal point of @entity88 ’ front line			1
the @entity25 international has lit up the @entity5 with a series of fine performances for the @entity51 @entity15 scored a double as @entity1 humiliated @entity0 5 - 1 in this @entity10 fixture last season the youngster has recently been deployed by @entity88 down the middle and scored a brace in the midweek @entity32 win over @entity31 , ending a 17 game goal drought for @entity1			1
he obviously needs to get back amongst the goals but his impact on the team is undeniable			0
his pass completion is at eighty per cent and at seventy five in the final third			0
he ’s linking up well with his team - mates and acting as the linchpin going forward			0
@entity24 has become renowned for his endeavour and work rate , which @entity9 has praised for motivating his team - mates into similar action			0
@entity24 has become an integral part of @entity0 's attack since signing from @entity40 this summer however @entity15 has also adapted his game to lead the line , winning 86 per cent of tackles and a statistic well ahead of @entity24 ’s 72 per cent rate			1
providing pace , an outlet and goals mixed with a brutal work rate , you can see similarities between @entity24 and @entity15			2
they can adapt in a central or wide role and clearly drive their side on , with both creating 40 chances for their team in the league this season including four assists for @entity15 and five for @entity24			0
@entity15 , missing a golden chance at @entity131 , has n't scored a league goal since september as both @entity1 and @entity0 have had their defensive frailties exposed this season , the pace from @entity15 and @entity24 is a true asset			1
their ability to start fresh counter attacks with one in two success rate in dribble completion highlights both their attacking potency			0
there is a down side to their impact with the pair in danger of burnout as we approach the turn of the year but if they continue to lead their team with such aplomb then it ’s hard to see either manager resting their star man too much other the busy festive fixture list			0
a win at @entity10 on sunday afternoon will gain more plaudits but which talisman will prevail is difficult to predict			0
all that is certain is @entity24 and @entity15 can provide a fascinating head - to - head in the crucial clash .			2

@entity24 will go head - to - head with @entity15 at @entity10
@entity0 's forward has scored nine @entity5 goals this season
@entity15 has become an integral part of @entity1 and @entity18 's sides , making 58 appearances for club and country so far in 2014
