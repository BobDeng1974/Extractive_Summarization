by @entity0 published : 10:53 est , 2 april 2012 updated : 03:12 est , 3 april 2012 castrating a male dog is a traumatic but necessary procedure , for the animal and the owners – but a new era of neutering beckons for family hounds the world over			1
@entity10 - based @entity9 has developed a compound that sterilises the dog and so avoids the need to lop off the testicles			1
it ’s called ‘ @entity24 ’ , which involves a mixture of @entity18 , @entity19 ( an amino acid ) and purified water being injected into the dog ’s scrotum			1
at the moment the @entity18 procedure is available for dogs three to 10 months old , with @entity9 expecting their compound to approved by the @entity45 for all dogs over three months old before the formula hits the shelves this year			1
so far 300 animals have received the treatment			1
the company ’s website explains that the compound works by killing off sperm and permanently blocking the tubes in the testicles			2
permanent solution : @entity9 ' formula kills off all sperm and blocks the tubes in the testicles it takes 30 days for the procedure to work			1
@entity63 admits that there have been some minor side effects in a small number of cases , such as vomiting and loss of appetite			2
there have been no reports so far of any long - term ill - health			2
the company said : ‘ we followed 40 dogs for over two years and have data on many of these dogs for over five years			0
since 1999 , when the initial clinical studies were performed , there have not been any reports of long - term side effects			0
’ surgical castration has a number of disadvantages , aside from the anguish for some proud owners of taking away part of their dog ’s masculinity			0
the procedure has been linked to the onset of cancer , hair loss and obesity			0
however , it ’s carried out to stop dogs overbreeding and to prevent animal shelters becoming overwhelmed			0
it ’s also used to subdue overly aggressive dogs .			0
