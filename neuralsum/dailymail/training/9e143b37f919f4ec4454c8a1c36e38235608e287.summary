@entity1 boss @entity0 has confirmed his side are close to completing a club - record deal to sign @entity4 from @entity5			1
the @entity7 international flew in for talks ahead of his proposed £ 9.5million move to the @entity10 on wednesday after @entity0 turned his attention to @entity4 after failing to convince @entity12 to sell @entity13			1
and it now appears @entity0 has finally added a striker to his ranks after confirming the club have received a work permit for the 24 - year - old			1
on the move : @entity1 are set to complete a deal for @entity5 's @entity4 for £ 9.5million move in doubt : @entity1 could lose out in the race to sign @entity25 midfielder @entity24 ' we expect the @entity4 deal to be completed before monday 's deadline , ' said @entity0			1
' we are just awaiting his signature			0
the work permit is already in			1
' @entity0 also revealed he is hoping to add ' one or two players ' to his ranks - but admitted he is struggling to sign @entity25 's @entity24			1
when asked if @entity4 was going to be the only signing on deadline day , @entity0 replied : ' never say never as we are still trying to do one or two bits			1
i ca n’t see us signing @entity24			2
i do n’t think it ’s going to happen			0
' @entity0 has given @entity39 permission to hold talks with @entity43 new boys @entity44 and expects the forward to sign a long - term deal at @entity47			1
' it looks like @entity49 will go to @entity44			2
we allowed @entity39 to speak to @entity44 and personally i wish him well			1
' he got an offer of a three or four year contract at @entity44 and the chance to play			2
' but i 've been in the game a long time and if all professional footballers were like @entity39 my job would be easy			2
' expected exit : @entity39 is closing in on a move to join @entity43 new boys @entity44 @entity0 also confirmed the signing of @entity61 defender @entity62 , although the 20 - year - old is likely to go straight into the club 's development squad rather than challenging for a first - team place			1
the 53 - year - old was disappointed with his side 's performance against @entity70 on sunday - labelling @entity1 's first - half display as the worst he has seen the @entity72 play since he joined the club			2
' we gave ourselves such a mountain to climb , the first - half performance was arguably the worst i ’ve seen us perform in my two years here			0
' thankfully there was a response to that and we took the game to @entity70 in the second half			0
on another day we could ’ve nicked something			0
i still ca n’t get over how bad we were in the first half because that was nowhere near our normal standard			0
' i wont accept a performance where we were so lifeless - it was incredible			0
we were much better in the second half			0
it would ’ve been a cricket score if we had n’t woken up			0
' i wish we could get them in on monday but we ca n’t because 11 of our players are away on international duty			0
mind you , they wo n’t be internationals if they keep playing like that			0
' nightmare display : @entity0 was disappointed with his side 's display against @entity70			2
