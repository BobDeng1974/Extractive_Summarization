@entity16 knows i 'm miserable now : psychologists have found that depressed or sad people prefer to listen to beautiful music buy artists like @entity20 ( lead singer @entity21 is pictured ) that triggers important memories rather than upbeat happy pop songs psychologists from the @entity25 investigated the moods of people listening to ‘ self - identified sad music ’ and asked them their reasons for picking the tracks			1
while there were a number of reasons a depressed person might select a particular piece of music , the researchers found that sometimes they did n’t necessarily want to pick happy tracks to cheer themselves up			1

hallelujah : listening to sad but beautiful songs by the likes of @entity10 ( pictured right ) or @entity11 ( left ) really can help you beat the blues , scientists said they found that people prefer to listen to beautiful music that triggers important memories and that convey a particular message			1
dr @entity60 , a lecturer at the university said : ‘ it was self - identified sad music , so it was music they chose themselves			1
many of the people surveyed selected the beautiful tracks mainly because they had a memory about it ‘ two common examples were hurt by @entity10 and @entity73 by @entity74 - the @entity11 cover			1
some people also chose @entity77 and @entity20			2
‘ there were some people who selected the music mainly because they had a memory about it			2
it was often a memory of a person or of an event			0
’ dr van den @entity60 explained that they were usually memories related to loved ones or sadness ‘ the sadness was often caused by love sickness or death			0
there were a lot of younger guys who had mentioned their dog dying too , ’ she said			0
the researchers found that people ’s music choice is linked to the individual ’s own expectations for listening to music and its effects on them			2
dr van den @entity60 said : ‘ the results showed that if an individual has intended to achieve mood enhancement through listening to sad music , this was in fact often achieved by first thinking about their situation or being distracted , rather than directly through listening to the music chosen			1
‘ indeed , where respondents indicated they had chosen music with the intention of triggering memories , this had a negative impact on creating a better mood			2
’ she added : ‘ the only selection strategy that was found to directly predict mood enhancement was where the music was perceived by the listener to have high aesthetic value			0
’ scientists discovered last year that people going through a break - up are more likely to feel uplifted by listening to tear - jerking songs			0
previous studies found that those who were feeling down countered that with uplifting experiences - upbeat songs or comedies			0
however the most recent research discovered that people are likely to gravitate towards experiences that echo their mood			0
according to @entity141 , music becomes a replacement that temporary fills the gap of a broken personal connection			0
researchers from @entity150 in @entity151 , the @entity145 in @entity146 and the @entity147 of @entity148 said : ' emotional experiences of aesthetic products are important to our happiness and well - being			0
' music , movies , paintings , or novels that are compatible with our current mood and feelings , akin to an empathic friend , are more appreciated when we experience broken or failing relationships			0
