mrs @entity8 said she had gone up to the room because her son told her @entity13 , 34 , had a woman in there , which is against the hotel 's rules			1
she said : ' the amount of blood and the stillness of her , there were no signs of life at that point			0
' i said to @entity13 " do you know what you 're doing to that girl ? " his chilling reply ? ' that 's no girl			1
' mrs @entity8 , who is studying for a degree in criminology and psychology , said : ' he was leaning over her			1
miss @entity15 , who worked in sales at @entity48 , is believed to have met @entity13 through mutual friends ' who in their right mind would just carry on leaning and looking down ? ' with me walking in would make you stand up , it would make you lift your head			1
that told me he did n't know what he was doing			0
' and she said that she was given no information about @entity13 by the authorities before he moved in			1
ms @entity15 died in the hotel in @entity10 , near @entity64 , last week			2
@entity13 also died at the scene after he was tasered by police			1
mrs @entity8 said she saw broken china in the room and injuries to miss @entity15 's neck and jaw @entity13 had taken a cocktail of mind - bending drugs and told friends he was hearing voices and hallucinating before attacking @entity77 and reportedly biting off parts of her face			1

' i had to decide what the hell was going on and then i had residents behind me in danger , ' she added			0
' i rang 999 and i made damn well sure he could n't get out of that room			2
it was the fear of what he was capable of			0
he did n't recognise me and he did n't recognise what he was doing			0
' i was holding onto the door knob so he could n't get out			2
i could n't let him flee the scene			0
' the police then came upstairs and took over			0
' if that girl had been alive , i could n't have closed the door , i would 've had to attack @entity13 with the fire extinguisher			1
' mrs @entity8 added that @entity13 had told her he had been in prison for theft , rather than assaulting an ex-partner and has now called for more information to be shared between agencies so that she knows people 's backgrounds before she accepts them as residents			1
' it 's worrying , it 's terrifying , ' she added			2
' i need to know who is walking through my door			2
someone needs to give me a bit of a heads up and people 's backgrounds			0
' if they 've come from prison , i think i personally should be told what 's happened			0
' mrs @entity8 also said she plans to seal off the room as no one will ever want to stay there			1
she added : ' i can never use that room again			0
i 'm going to have the door removed , it 'll be an open room			2
i would n't expect anyone to want to be in that room			0
' a @entity133 pathologist has carried out initial tests on the victim and have indicated the cause of ms @entity15 's death as headwounds			2
but they are continuing to carry out a series of further tests on @entity142 before an inquest is heard			0
a gwent police spokeswoman said : ' the initial post-mortem results for @entity146 indicate that she died from head injuries			0
' however it may take a number of weeks before the post-mortem is completed			0

@entity8 said she would have attacked @entity13 , 34 , with a fire extinguisher if she believed she could have saved @entity153 , 22
she said : ' do you know what you 're doing to that girl ?
' that 's no girl , ' replied the drug - *crazed* murderer
she went to the room to confront killer as *guests* are not allowed in room
when she opened the door she found the man *hunched* over his victim
@entity13 , who died after being tasered , was staring with ' black eyes '
mrs @entity8 now plans to seal off the room in the south @entity11 hotel
