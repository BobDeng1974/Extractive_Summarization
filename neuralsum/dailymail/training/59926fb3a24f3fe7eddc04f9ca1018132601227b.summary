the @entity1 ’ plan to save @entity2 will only come to fruition if the existing board agrees to a two - in , two - out compromise			1
talks between representatives of the @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 consortium and the @entity12 board are ongoing as the club seeks a short - term solution to an increasingly drastic financial situation			1
with @entity20 financier @entity19 — who revealed that he had not wanted @entity21 or any other @entity2 player sold as a condition of his offer — now apparently out of the running after the board ’s rejection of his improved £ 20million bid , the @entity1 appear to be the only show in town			1
the future of @entity2 remains uncertain due to the club 's drastic financial situation @entity2 ace @entity31 celebrates after putting his side ahead against @entity33 in their last league game they are prepared to offer £ 6.5m in emergency funding , which would keep the club solvent until the end of the season , with that loan being converted into equity at the forthcoming share issue			2
aware of the fact @entity46 owner @entity45 has two men on the board after lending the club £ 3m , the @entity8 - led consortium are adamant they should have no less than that number for an investment of more than twice that amount			1
@entity53 understands it is the board ’s insistence in allowing only one of the group to join them that is holding up the deal — and increasing the chances the club will not be able to meet its payroll obligations a week on thursday			2
given the sway @entity45 has at the club with just 8.92 per cent of the shares , it is likely the @entity57 are seeking the removal of chief executive @entity66 and finance director @entity67			0
embattled chairman @entity68 seems a likely sacrificial lamb but whether his head along with one of @entity45 ’s crew would satisfy the would - be saviours remains to be seen			0
@entity46 owner @entity45 has two members on the @entity2 board following a loan £ 3million negotiations between both parties are ongoing but the lingering possibility that @entity81 could yet call an @entity82 seeking boardroom change is a threat to the talks			2
@entity81 ’s scheme to have season - ticket money paid into a trust fund last summer put him on a war footing with the board			0
their reluctance to deal with him means he is being pushed towards calling for an @entity82 in order to get the personnel changes he desires			0
not only could this take up to 42 days , it would potentially pull the rug from under the group seeking to achieve such goals by more conventional methods			0
although the impasse means the club are fast running out of money , they yesterday closed the door on the possibility of being financed and taken over by @entity108 owner @entity19			2
@entity19 had upped an original £ 18m bid to £ 20m last week on the proviso that fresh share capital would be issued to him			1
but on monday the board again rejected his proposal on the basis it was unlikely to secure the 75 - per - cent shareholder support for such equity to be offered to a non-shareholder			0
the @entity12 club have turned down a £ 20million bid by @entity20 financier @entity19 in rejecting @entity19 ’s latest offer , a @entity2 statement to the @entity124 emphasised the same problems it raised with the first offer			1
‘ the revised proposal by mr @entity19 was similar to his first proposal in the respect that it sought a placing of 100 million shares ( to be priced at 20p in this proposal ) which would require the approval of shareholders ( at least a 75 - per - cent majority ) at a general meeting , ’ it said			0
‘ the board of @entity2 rejected the first proposal from mr @entity19 on january 6 on the basis that the board felt it unlikely that the approval of shareholders holding sufficient shares would be forthcoming			1
’ a survey of the views of ‘ a number of major shareholders ’ on the revised proposal had suggested it , too , was unlikely to receive the backing required , the club added			0
as part of @entity19 ’s £ 20m offer , he was willing to hand the club an emergency £ 6.5m loan to help alleviate their cash - flow problems			1
responding to the latest rejection , @entity19 first released a statement to the @entity124 before commenting on the situation			0
only agreeing to a compromise on board members will allow the @entity1 plan to take flight a statement on his behalf read : ‘ it was announced by @entity2 this morning that the board of the @entity167 had rejected the revised proposal on the basis that they felt it unlikely that the approval of shareholders holding sufficient shares would be forthcoming , and that therefore the board did not intend to hold the general meeting that would be necessary to implement the proposal			1
the board did not make any counter proposal			0
‘ @entity19 today announces that as a result of the board ’s failure to provide a counter proposal or to engage in any meaningful negotiations with him , he does not now intend to make an offer for @entity2			2
’ @entity19 added : ‘ i ’m disappointed the @entity2 board has rejected my revised offer , which addressed the club ’s immediate and long - term needs			1
‘ clearly the directors have a different path they want to go down			0

@entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 have set up a *consotium* to try and save @entity2
the ' @entity1 ' plan will only work if board agrees to a compromise
@entity12 club *previously* rejected a £ 20m bid from @entity20 financier @entity19
