by @entity0 published : 23:21 est , 28 june 2012 updated : 05:14 est , 29 june 2012 tragedy : @entity2 , 14 , drowned after trying to cross a swollen brook during the gruelling @entity5 expedition in 2007 a ' well - meaning ' scoutmaster has been blamed for the death of a 14 - year - old girl who was swept away and drowned while crossing a swollen @entity10 brook			1
@entity2 was carried off to her death while trying to help a friend over the crossing during the gruelling @entity5 outdoor expedition			2
a language teacher supervising the private school group had advised @entity17 and her friends not to attempt the swollen crossing around @entity20 in @entity10 , as the girls were battling against wind , rain , hail , and exhaustion			2
but a court heard yesterday that scoutmaster @entity26 countermanded the teacher 's advice and told the shivering girls to cross , as he feared they were getting hypothermia			1
when @entity17 attempted to help friend @entity34 across the brook , she was carried away and drowned , @entity32 's @entity31 heard			0
her mother , @entity36 , blamed her private school at @entity32 's @entity31 , saying in a £ 350,000 damages claim that the language teacher supervising the teenagers was simply not up to the job			1
however , top judge , mr @entity42 , yesterday cleared the teacher , @entity43 , and the school of all blame for the march 2007 tragedy			1
the judge instead ruled that responsibility lay with a kindly scout master mr @entity26 , who has since died , who tried to help the exhausted youngsters			1
mrs @entity51 's barrister , dr @entity50 , had told the court mr @entity43 had no formal outdoor leadership qualifications and accused him of ' incompetence '			2
dangerous : the @entity20 on @entity10 had become swollen during driving rain and hail on the trip , the court heard ( file picture ) but mr @entity42 said he had done the right thing when he told the pupil who led the group , @entity63 , not to attempt a crossing of @entity20			2
cleared : a high court judge refused to lay any blame for the tragedy on teacher @entity43 , who had told the students not to cross the swollen brook that instruction , given over a mobile phone , was countermanded by scout master , @entity26 , who had encountered the bedraggled children at @entity74			1
mr @entity42 said : ' this tragic accident was the consequence of the well meant , but ill - advised , intervention of mr @entity26			2
' although it was foreseeable that the children might seek an adult 's advice after failing to meet up with teachers at the @entity74 , the judge said it could not have been predicted that mr @entity26 , who has since died , ' would give bad advice thereby putting the group at risk '			1
in foul conditions , the group of 11 children , all pupils at independent prepatory school , @entity93 , since re-named @entity91 , in @entity89 , @entity90 , had set out alone on the gruelling leg of the @entity5 route to @entity74 unaccompanied			0
two teachers , who had been told to meet the children there , lost their way en route , but the judge said their ' navigational error ' did not mean they were incompetent			0
as the children waited shivering at the @entity74 for an adult to arrive , mr @entity26 , came to their aid			0
seeing the children in a distressed state , and fearing that hypothermia might set in , he advised them not to wait around and directed then across the brook			0
exhausting : @entity17 was one of 11 students who had tackled the @entity116 endurance : a high court judge yesterday said the tough two - day @entity5 expedition still has ' great social value ' for youngsters the judge said that ' bad advice ' countermanded the instruction mr @entity43 had given to @entity63 on her mobile phone that the party was not to attempt a crossing , but should make its way around the head of the brook to @entity131			1
that instruction was ' entirely appropriate ' , said the judge , who added that , although the children were ' cold , wet and miserable ' , they would have been capable of continuing with their treck			0
even had mr @entity43 , or the school , been found negligent , the judge said he would have found that mr @entity26 ' intervention ' unquestionably amounted to an independent supervening cause ' of the tragedy			1
after the accident , the rest of the party was evacuated from the moor by helicopter			0
dr @entity146 had earlier told the court : ' the rain was heavy and it was hailing			0
a number of the children fell into bogs and became drenched '			0
whilst recognising the ' great social value ' of the @entity5 , and saying that mrs @entity154 ' would be the last to see any step taken which would diminish the benefit to young people of this activity ' , he argued the children had been exposed to unacceptable risk			0
' the expedition is supposed to be a challenge - not a survival exercise , ' he said			0
however - after a case which is estimated to have run up lawyers ' bills of at least £ 500,000 - mr @entity42 rejected claims that the children should have been accompanied , or at least ' shadowed ' , by a competent adult on their way to the @entity171			2
had mrs @entity51 won the case , she would have been entitled to £ 350,000 damages on behalf of her daughter 's estate .			1
