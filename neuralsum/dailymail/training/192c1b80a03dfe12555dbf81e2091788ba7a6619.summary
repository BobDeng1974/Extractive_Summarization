the search for @entity1 is the most extensive and expensive ever undertaken , but it ’s been claimed the plane could have been located if its tracking software had been upgraded - something that costs just £ 6 per flight			1
according to new book @entity1 : the mystery , the @entity7 had a ‘ data package ’ that only transmitted the most basic flight information , so authorities were n’t able to get a gps fix on it			1
for just six pounds , however , this package could have been improved , the book says , resulting in far more detailed information about the 777 's movements being pinged			1

the @entity47 plane sent a signal to an @entity80 satellite , but not location data			2
engineers conducted a novel analysis of those signals to determine the plane 's flight path , but the effort took time			1
@entity79 's @entity99 is carrying a robot submarine , the @entity101 21 , to survey the ocean floor for @entity1 's black box @entity46 also urged the aviation industry to consider changing planes ' communications systems so that they ca n't be disabled midair			0
the government has said someone severed the plane 's communication systems with the ground and deliberately diverted @entity1			2
he said the capacity of the cockpit data recorder , one of a plane 's two black boxes , should be extended from two hours currently to recording the entire flight , while its location beacons should be made to last at least 90 days , instead of 30 days now			1
