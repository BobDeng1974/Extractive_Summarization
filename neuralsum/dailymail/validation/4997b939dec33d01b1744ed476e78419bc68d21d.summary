it looks like the aftermath of an earthquake in suburbia			0
but this broken brickwork is actually the result of a botched building job that brought the house down on a couple ’s plan for a basement extension			1
@entity12 and his eight months pregnant fiancée @entity11 fled for their lives when the building cracked in half , escaping from their ground floor flat with their upstairs neighbours as debris fell ‘ like something out of a disaster movie ’			1
that was just the start of their nightmare			0
for although the builders were found by a judge to have been ‘ incompetent ’ and were ordered to pay £ 287,000 damages , the firm is believed to be insolvent , the @entity28 heard			1
and while the couple had buildings cover , the insurance company has so far refused to pay up			2
now the pair fear they will never see their money – and they are still saddled with a 23 - year mortgage on the £ 345,000 flat			1
@entity41 and his partner @entity42 , who was eight months pregnant at the time , were planning to extend their £ 345,000 ground - floor flat into the basement of this property in @entity48 , north @entity49 , when disaster struck mr @entity12 said @entity51 were paid to do the work , but he and his partner soon noticed cracks appearing in the walls of the @entity57 home after a bout of heavy rain mr @entity12 said he noticed the cracks widening dramatically			1
the pair alerted their upstairs neighbour and all of them were forced to flee as the building fell down into the basement yesterday 39 - year - old investment banker @entity68 described how , in ten or 20 seconds , cracks in the wall went from 1cm wide to 10cm before one side of the building fell away			1
the trauma caused her early contractions and she had to be taken to hospital			2
the baby boy was born unharmed six weeks later			2
miss @entity11 and marketing manager mr @entity12 , 40 , bought the house in @entity48 , @entity49 , four years ago and decided to extend into the basement			1
@entity79 began work in september 2012			0
it went wrong within two months and the couple sued			2
last week mr @entity83 said the ‘ overwhelming probability ’ was that the builders failed to carry out the work with reasonable care and skill			0
@entity90 council has demolished the building and made the site safe			0
and the couple – who now have a second son – have been renting as they contest the insurance company ’s decision			0
miss @entity11 said : ‘ the good news is that we ’re happy and healthy and we ’ve got two lovely kids			1
’ the judge ordered @entity79 to pay the couple almost £ 290,000 for the destruction of their @entity57 home			1
mr @entity12 and ms @entity11 were forced to move out of their dream property , along with their neighbour , and subsequent checks by @entity111 revealed the house would have to be pulled down broken home : workers dismantle the property in north @entity49 after the botched basement extension			1
a judge today ruled that it was the builders ' ' incompetence ' which led to the collapse in tatters : the builders were ordered to pay £ 290,000 in compensation to mr @entity12 and ms @entity11 , but the couple were told they may not see a penny because the firm has gone bust all gone : the couple were forced to live a nomadic existence after the house was taken down ( pictured ) , moving through a string of temporary homes , but have now settled in @entity134 there is now nothing more than a hole where their old house used to be , with supporting beams used to keep the neighbouring properties up @entity41 and his partner @entity42 , who was eight months pregnant at the time , had to run from their flat as the house collapsed but the court heard @entity51 is ' believed to be insolvent ' , so the couple may well never see any of the money			1
describing it as ' a sad case ' , the judge said the couple bought a lease of the ground floor of 4 @entity156 in 2011			1
they needed more space for their growing family and decided to extend into the basement , @entity51 starting work in september 2012			1
however , it all went horribly wrong on november 24 2012 after a heavy rain storm , said the judge			0
cracks which the couple had already noticed began to widen fast and ' they could actually hear the fabric of the house tearing apart '			1
the couple and the upstairs tenant , who had a baby , hastily evacuated and watched as the building crumbled			1
' deeply shocked ' , mr @entity12 and miss @entity11 escaped with little more than the clothes they stood up in , the court heard			1
they watched as the flank wall first ballooned outwards before collapsing in on itself			0
the next door house was also badly damaged			0
heavily pregnant miss @entity11 went into premature labour due to the trauma , although her baby was happily delivered unharmed			1
the council took emergency steps to shore - up what remained of the building and it has remained derelict ever since			0
since the destruction of their home , the couple have led a nomadic existence , moving between temporary homes , but have now settled in @entity134			2
and they suffered yet another blow when they discovered that the loss was not covered by their home insurance			0
they now face paying off the remaining 23 years of the mortgage , while dealing with the heart - breaking loss of their house , according to the @entity207			0
the couple 's lawyers argued that @entity51 was ' completely out of its depth ' and ' not competent to do the job which it had been employed to do '			2
and the judge ruled : ' the overwhelming probability is that @entity51 failed to carry out their work with reasonable care and skill '			2
' the firm had taken no effective steps to to prop up the flank wall or to lay a concrete floor slab which could have averted disaster			2
' however , the judge said @entity51 had ' played no part ' in the case and was believed to be insolvent			2
the couple also sued engineering firm , @entity228 , who designed the essential structure of the basement extension			2
however , whilst expressing ' the greatest sympathy ' for the couple , the judge ruled that the company had not been negligent and bore no responsibility for the disaster			0
@entity51 was ordered to pay £ 287,754 damages - although the couple are likely to face an uphill struggle in getting hold of any of that			1
denying claims they opted for the cheapest service on offer , miss @entity11 said she considered quotes from a number of builders before selecting @entity51			1
she and mr @entity12 checked references and chose a firm that said it had carried out basement extensions in the past			0
she added : ‘ the builder did have insurance , which i made him get , and checked before he started			0
i also called the company to make sure he had it			0
but they also declined to cover him			0
’ some neighbouring houses were damaged by the collapse , including one that the wall fell against			0
some of those neighbours ’ sued the couple			0
‘ they will be paid , ’ miss @entity11 said			1
' everyone but us gets paid , basically			0

@entity41 and @entity42 paid @entity51 to extend ground floor flat
couple noticed cracks in walls of £ 345,000 home and said they listened to the ' fabric of the house tearing apart '
pair ran from property and shock sent miss @entity11 into an early labour , though her baby was delivered healthy
they were today *awarded* £ 290,000 at @entity28 today but may not see a penny after building firm went bust
