by @entity1 reporter published : 18:53 est , 11 july 2013 updated : 18:54 est , 11 july 2013 in the @entity4 , a good education comes at a price and whilst it 's common knowledge college costs are on the rise , some schools are now charging more than $ 60,000 a year to educate a student for just one year			1
a list released by the @entity11 lists the colleges and universities with the highest tuition in the country			0
@entity16 , @entity16 is the country 's most expensive school with tuition costing $ 61,977 a year			1
pricey : the most expensive degrees in nation cost almost $ 62,000 per year four years of hard work and fun : you 'll have a degree from one of the @entity4 's finest colleges but be down more than quarter of a millions dollars other residential colleges often add an extra $ 10,000 or more for board along with other fees			1
the list , compiled by @entity32 lists tuition , required fees , room and board for an entire four - year undergraduate degree			0
of course the numbers are solely what you would pay to the school			0
there would still be the costs of books , travel , and and food			0
an earlier analysis , by the @entity11 , ranked @entity16 64th among private four - year colleges , but that listing just counted tuition			2
@entity16 is followed closely by @entity48 , part of @entity51 's @entity50 , and @entity52 in @entity53			2
college education costs have been rising steadily for years , outpacing inflation			2
between 1982 - 1983 and 2012 - 2013 , tuition and fees for a private four – year college education rose 167 percent , and the price tag for a public four – year education climbed 257 percent , according to @entity63			2
student loan debt is also a growing problem , particularly now that @entity66 has allowed the interest rate on student loans to double			1
less expensive : at 20th on the list , @entity69 in @entity70 would cost $ 217,000 for a four - year course @entity16 , $ 247,908 @entity48 , $ 247,040 @entity52 , $ 245,784 @entity73 , $ 243,116 @entity74 , $ 242,624 @entity75 , $ 240,856 @entity76 , $ 240,804 @entity77 , $ 240,156 @entity52 at @entity78 , $ 240,012 @entity79 , $ 239.440 @entity80 , $ 239,208 @entity81 , $ 239,208 @entity82 , $ 238,528 @entity83 , $ 238,460 @entity84 , $ 238,368 @entity85 , $ 238,280 @entity86 , $ 237,896 @entity87 , $ 237,784 @entity88 , $ 237,664 # @entity89 , $ 217,556 source : @entity4 @entity11 , @entity91 there are many other respectable colleges that decent value for money when balancing academics with affordability			1
some flagship public universities are on the list and include the @entity100 , the @entity101 , the @entity102 – @entity103 , the @entity104 – @entity105 , the @entity106 , and the @entity107 – @entity108			0
@entity63 suggested a ' moderate budget ' for a school year at a public university to be $ 22,000 , and over $ 43,000 for a private institution			0
earlier this week the @entity113 failed to restore lower interest rates on student loans which means that undergraduates are likely to have to pay rates twice as high as last year			1
the @entity119 - backed proposal from @entity121 leaders would have left interest rates on subsidized @entity124 loans at 3.4 per cent for another year while lawmakers took up a comprehensive overhaul			1
the one - year stopgap measure failed to overcome a procedural hurdle as @entity129 — and a handful of @entity121 — urged colleagues to consider a plan now that would link interest rates to the financial markets and reduce @entity66 ' role in setting students ' borrowing rates			2
the rate increase does not affect many students right away as loan documents are generally signed just before students return to campus , and few students returned to school over the @entity146 holiday			0
existing loans were not affected , either			0
however , without any congressional action in the coming weeks , the increase could spell an extra $ 2,600 for an average student returning to campus this fall , according to @entity66 ' @entity152			0
sunny and 75 : at the @entity83 for $ 59,000 a year you can attend one of the @entity157 's finest learning establishments and great party schools ! during last year 's presidential campaign , lawmakers from both parties voted to keep interest rates on subsidized @entity124 loans at 3.4 per cent			1
yet this year , without a presidential election looming , the issue seemed to fizzle and the july 1 deadline passed without action			0
the @entity119 and most @entity121 senators favored keeping the rates at 3.4 per cent for now and including a broad overhaul of federal student loans in the @entity172 rewrite lawmakers expect to take up this fall .			1

the cost of education in the @entity4 has risen by 167 per cent in *30* years
@entity16 is the nation 's most expensive school
the interest on student loans is set to increase over the next few years after @entity119 failed to cut a deal to keep interest rates low
