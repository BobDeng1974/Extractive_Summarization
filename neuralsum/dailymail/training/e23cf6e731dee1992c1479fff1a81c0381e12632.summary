when it comes to @entity3 relations , it is perhaps fair to say that the @entity4 are as fond of us as we are of them			1
but in case there was any lingering doubt that relations just might thaw ahead of the @entity11 , you should take a look at these images first			1
they are part of a @entity17 poster advertising campaign to encourage the @entity4 to take the high - speed train to @entity19			2
sacre bleu ! this cheeky @entity17 poster features a spoof @entity23 statue of naked men pursuing popular pub sports the posters , which were created by a @entity4 ad agency , invert the usually athletic form of ancient @entity23 statues to portray @entity30 as pot - bellied , beer - swilling slobs with a penchant for pub games			1
two portly actors were recruited to model for the job , in which the ‘ sculptures ’ were created in digital 3d and based on photographs			2
far from displaying a chiselled physique , the figures appear to carry more than a little weight around the belly			2
instead of holding the discus or crouching in athletic pose , one clutches a snooker cue while the other holds a dart			1
last night , @entity50 , the agency behind the ads , insisted they were in good fun and a ‘ homage to @entity56 popular culture ’			0
the posters are aimed at attracting the @entity4 to take the high speed train to @entity19 - possibly to poke fun at our @entity11 aspirations the ads were designed by @entity62 ad agency @entity50 with whom part @entity64 - owned games sponsor @entity17 has been working for more than a decade its previous creations for the campaign included a redesign of a @entity64 banknote showing mr @entity71 in a tiara			0
former @entity74 star @entity73 was one of the actors used in the latest campaign			0
unmasked as the pot - bellied snooker player , the 59 - year - old @entity78 actor said : ‘ i ’m not in the best of shape these days but that ’s obviously what they were looking for			1
i am what they think is a typical middle - aged @entity56 whose idea of sport is drinking beer and playing snooker			1
‘ i knew roughly what the idea was and that it was the @entity4 ’s idea of a joke			0
’ @entity50 president @entity94 insisted the @entity17 adverts have been universally well received			0
he added : ‘ the public awaits the next ads religiously , wondering “ what will they think up next ? ” ’ perhaps unsurprisingly , the advertisements do not appear in @entity56			0
@entity17 said the campaign was ‘ a tongue - in cheek campaign playing on the age - old @entity4 - @entity64 rivalry ’ .			0
