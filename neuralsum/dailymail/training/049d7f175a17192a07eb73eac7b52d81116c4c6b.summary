the diary of @entity1 translated by @entity2 this is a story within a story — and it has been waiting an awfully long time to be told			1
the larger story is the @entity7 in 1941 and 1942 , one of the grimmer and more brutal narratives of @entity10 in september 1941 , the invading @entity15 army , with the help of @entity13 forces , had the @entity17 city completely surrounded			1
but @entity18 decided that finishing the job and razing it to the ground would be a waste of military resources			1
far easier just to let the inhabitants starve to death			1
@entity1 , 16 ( pictured ) , experience the @entity7 first hand and recorded it all in her diary as the @entity34 ’s directive of september 29 put it : ‘ we have no interest in saving any part of the civilian population of this large city			1
’ the story within this story is that of @entity1 , a 16 - year - old girl who lived there			1
between may 1941 and may 1942 , she kept a diary — a day - to - day record of encroaching catastrophe			1
unlike @entity41 , she survived			1
in june 1942 , @entity1 was evacuated and the diary was left behind			1
somehow it , too , survived and turned up in a sheaf of documents at the @entity46 in @entity47 20 years later			1
but it has taken another 50 years to come into print , guided and nurtured by a trio of @entity17 researchers			1
in late summer 1941 , life in @entity47 was going on much as normal			1
the city ’s 2.5 million inhabitants did not immediately grasp the severity of their situation			1
true , they could almost see the @entity15 to the south of the city			1
@entity60 air raids and artillery bombardment were driving people into bomb shelters several times a day , for hours at a time			1
but the @entity13 troops to the north were no threat , surely ? they were 20 miles away and had no big guns			1
in november , however , food supplies were running perilously short and the authorities had to admit the truth			1
the siege lasted 872 days			1
bread rations were eventually reduced to 125g , 4½ oz , per person per day			1
( double that for manual workers			2
) people would start queueing outside shops early in the morning , but there was never enough to go round			2
new dishes were invented , such as khryapa , made from the green outer leaves of a head of cabbage			2
people ate crows , pigeons , cats and dogs			2
@entity1 ’s family cat , she records , kept them going for ten days ( ‘ i never thought cat meat would be so tender and so tasty ’ )			1
under siege : citizens of wartime @entity47 died of starvation in the streets , and some turned to cannibalism eventually , hunger drove some of the most desperate to cannibalism			2
our @entity17 editors , possibly precise to a fault , distinguish between two kinds : trupoedstvo , eating the flesh of those who have died of natural causes ; and lyudoedstvo , killing others for the purpose			2
more than 2,000 arrests were made during the siege for such crimes			2
and yet , as @entity1 ’s writing here shows , most of the city ’s inhabitants kept a firm grasp on their humanity			1
their stoicism and determination were almost heartbreaking , for the death toll was horrendous			2
in one week in december 1941 , 841 people dropped dead of starvation on the street			2
between january and april 1942 , between 110 and 160 people were dying every hour			1
no one knows exactly how many died in all , but 800,000 is the historians ’ best guess			2
when @entity1 ’s diary begins , war has yet to be declared			1
there are exams to revise for , and she worries incessantly whether @entity135 , the boy she likes , has feelings for her			2
i have a daughter of the same age and similar preoccupations and , in some ways , i found these the hardest pages of the book to read — the innocence set against the reader ’s terrible sense of impending doom			2
@entity18 may have been happy to wait for the inhabitants to die of starvation , but he wanted to break their spirits first			2
more than 13,000 artillery missiles , 3,500 high - explosive bombs and nearly 56,000 incendiary bombs landed on the city in the first three months of the siege			0
then came the worst blow of all : @entity1 ’s mother dies			1
‘ i still ca n’t believe it			0
it has n’t fully sunk in			0
but already , i feel the emptiness of loneliness descending upon me			0
the love we felt for one another can not be put into words			0
such love can only exist between a mother and daughter			0
‘ i ’m in so much pain			0
i ’m trembling all over			0
this is it , the first blow			0
i ’m still only 16 , and i ’ve already been dealt the first blow			0
what else does fate have in store for me ? i do n’t know			0
‘ thousands of people are dying on the frontline and some of them are 16 - year - old boys , the same age as me			0
’ that very much captures her tone — sweet , ingenuous , incredibly young in every way , but with the soul of a writer , and one or two of the skills , too			0
as the food supplies dwindle and malnutrition threatens , she begins to lose hope			0
‘ it is starting to seem as though it ’s no longer our destiny to see brighter days			1
it ’s no longer our destiny to live until the bright , joyous month of may			0
’ she and her aunt fantasise about the glorious meals they will eat when it ’s all over			0
when the old woman who shares their flat dies , all they can think about is whether they will be able to keep her ration card until it expires later in the month			0
when the body goes , the ration card has to go , too			0
generations of eminent historians have told and retold the story of @entity47 , but you ca n’t beat the raw immediacy of first - person testimony			0
i ’ll admit that , when i first started the book , i did wonder , is this for real ? but you ca n’t fake this sort of thing			0
her suffering is real and terrible			0
as we read on , we can feel something important sapping out of her			0
call it spirit , if you like , or the optimism of youth			0
but adversity does not strengthen her ; it corrodes her			0
she gets away , but the best of her , we suspect , she has left behind			0
thanks to our assiduous @entity17 , we now know that @entity1 spent the rest of the war in @entity237 , returned to @entity47 in 1945 to study mosaics at the @entity239 , had a long and varied career in design and died in @entity242 in 1991			1
but , as far they could ascertain , she never wrote another word			0
indeed , when they contacted her niece , ‘ the initial response at the other end of the line was confusion : “ yes , we know @entity251			0
what diary ? she wrote it during the siege ? she never mentioned it			1
” ’ for some reason that i ca n’t put my finger on , this almost seems the saddest thing of all .			0
