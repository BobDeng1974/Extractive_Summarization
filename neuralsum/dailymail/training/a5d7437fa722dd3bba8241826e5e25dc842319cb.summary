the married @entity1 diplomat accused of conducting a sordid prison affair with a convicted drug dealer has broken her silence about the scandal , telling friends it was ‘ a huge error of judgment ’ on her part			1
but despite confessing her naivety in forming a friendship with the man known as @entity15 ’s ‘ @entity14 ’ , @entity10 also feels the @entity18 has ‘ thrown her to the wolves ’			1
@entity10 , a mother of two , was suspended by officials last month after she befriended @entity20 , the @entity1 - born ringleader of a drug - smuggling syndicate , who claimed that he and the @entity23 graduate were in love			1
she denies their relationship was intimate , branding @entity20 ’s claims of secret prison trysts as ‘ malicious , nasty and ridiculous ’			1
@entity10 has told friends she did not have an affair with convicted drug dealer @entity20 when she visited the @entity15 prison where he was being held on behalf of the @entity1 consul as vice-consul , @entity10 met @entity20 , 44 , when he and three accomplices – including @entity1 grandmother @entity20 – were jailed at the island ’s @entity32			1
yesterday family friends of @entity10 , who is described as ‘ a brilliant academic but hardly street-wise ’ insisted : ‘ @entity20 was depressed and @entity10 worried he might harm himself			1
she responded by empathising with him			0
she felt sorry for him and tried to reassure him that she too had felt the same at times in her life			0
but she never hugged him or made any sort of physical contact			0
‘ now she realises in her effort to try to help him she was terribly naive			0
she exchanged far too much personal information with @entity20			1
’ friends insist @entity10 is now living in fear of her life and has become so stressed that she has twice been admitted to hospital			1
one friend even questioned why she was ever allowed to visit antiques restorer @entity20 unaccompanied			1
‘ @entity10 had no previous experience in consular work , no proper training and no support or guidance , ’ he said			1
‘ to allow @entity10 to visit these prisoners on her own was absurd			1
we all believe the @entity18 showed an extraordinary lack of care and welfare for her			0
its actions put @entity10 ’s safety at risk			2
‘ @entity10 was – and still is – forbidden by them to speak out and yet her silence has been wrongly misconstrued as guilt			2
meanwhile , @entity20 has continued to harass her			2
presumably the @entity18 has to investigate any allegations made against a diplomat			0
but in not robustly defending her as it should have done , it has simply thrown her to the wolves			0
’ allegations that @entity10 is ready to leave her @entity72 husband to be with @entity20 are nonsense , said the source			1
‘ @entity10 is a happily married young woman with two children			2
there is no way she would have even entertained an affair with a convicted criminal			2
’ @entity10 visited @entity32 in @entity15 to see @entity20 when she was working for the @entity1 consul the revelations are the latest twist in the story of ‘ death - row grandmother ’ @entity20 , 58 , who was sentenced in 2013 and whose execution by firing squad is believed to be imminent			1
the former legal secretary from @entity87 was caught smuggling cocaine worth £ 1.5 million from @entity89 to @entity15 in 2012			2
she claims she was forced to act as a drugs mule by a syndicate who threatened the lives of her sons in @entity95			0
the other gang members convicted include @entity20 , 41 , and @entity20 ’s partner @entity20 , 41 – sentenced to four years and one year respectively			1
@entity20 was sentenced to six years			2
@entity10 took up her position as vice-consul in @entity15 in february 2014			1
part of her role involved visiting and helping @entity1 people in jail over there , although , according to the source , @entity20 did n’t want any help and always refused to see @entity10 or anyone else from the @entity1 consul			1
the @entity18 first investigated @entity10 ’s relationship with @entity20 last march after the prison complained to the @entity109 that she had been caught kissing and embracing @entity20 on a visit			1
the mother of two with her @entity72 husband @entity113 ‘ it was not appropriate for them to act like that , ’ the prison governor told the @entity115			2
@entity10 , who was questioned in @entity119 , denied any wrongdoing and remained in her job			2
she was suspended only last month when the @entity18 became aware of tape recordings said to reveal intimate conversations between the two			0
last week , however , friends of @entity10 continued to deny there was even so much as an embrace between the pair			1
the friend took up her side of the story : ‘ in march @entity10 accompanied @entity20 to a local hospital for a routine check up			1
' he is a convicted criminal , a drugs lord , and yet she was put in the vulnerable position of expecting to take him to hospital by herself			0
’ it was during this visit , claims the friend , that @entity20 began threatening @entity10			1
‘ this is a job primarily where she was to offer support and she wanted to help people who found themselves in prison in a foreign country , ’ said the source			0
‘ and wanting to help , she chatted to @entity20			2
‘ whether or not he became infatuated with @entity10 , we do n’t know			2
but he began calling her every day			0
‘ he constantly messaged her , saying she was duty - bound to visit a prisoner if requested			0
‘ when she said she was too busy , he became extremely upset			0
certainly she realised how naive she ’d been when @entity20 told her he ’d recorded conversations they had shared and was planning to sell them to the press , as taken out of context these could have given the wrong impression			1
' he also said he knew of people who could impersonate her voice on the phone and would doctor recordings			0
‘ she realises she should have told her superiors but , then again , this was a new job and she was anxious not to give the wrong impression			0
@entity20 said he knew where she lived			2
she was beside herself with worry for the welfare of her children and husband if she did not agree to his demands			0
’ fearful , @entity10 asked for extra security at her home but was told she ’d have to fund it herself			1
friends said @entity10 felt let down by the @entity18 who she felt should not have allowed her to visit @entity20 alone the friend further alleges : ‘ over the next few weeks three mobiles belonging to @entity10 were stolen along with her bank cards			1
she now wonders if @entity20 was behind this			2
‘ certainly @entity20 became obsessed with @entity10 , and wanted her to visit him every day in prison			1
if she did n’t visit , he would fly into a terrifying rage			0
but she simply did n't have the nous to be able to cope			0
‘ while her husband and close friends knew the affair allegation was rubbish , @entity10 was devastated , ’ said the friend			1
‘ by now even @entity20 had confirmed in writing to her superiors that they ’d never had a romantic or physical relationship and she ’d cut off all contact with him			0
‘ @entity10 has never ever said anything of an explicit or sexual nature to @entity20			1
bizarrely he even sends her texts now – which she never responds to – apologising for his lies			0
he just seems to be totally obsessed with her			0
‘ before this nightmare @entity10 had a promising career with the @entity18			0
she has won a consular excellence award and has been praised for her high standards , support and guidance			0
yet in her bid to do the job to the best of her ability she has made errors of judgment			0
‘ but so have others with far more experience , and yet she finds herself being the only one singled out , the person who is being blamed			0

@entity10 has told friends she never had an affair with @entity20
@entity20 is part of a group of @entity210 convicted of drug *offences* in @entity15
@entity10 visited him in prison on behalf of the @entity1 consul several times
she admits being naive in forming a friendship with man known as ' @entity14 '
but insisted the pair did not have sordid trysts as he previously claimed
