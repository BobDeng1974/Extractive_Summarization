victim ' awoke in @entity21 off - campus house with a gun to her head and @entity0 *forcing* her to commit a sex act '
afterwards the distraught woman called 911 and spoke with an *abrasive* dispatcher , a recording of the call shows
the woman - who was visiting from out of town - did not know her exact *location* and was too upset to give specific details about the suspect
dispatcher becomes impatient and says they will not be able to find him
despite the dispatcher 's rude responses , she will not be reprimanded because the suspect was caught and charged , her manager said
