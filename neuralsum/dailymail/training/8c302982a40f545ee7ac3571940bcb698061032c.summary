by @entity0 published : 09:56 est , 31 october 2013 updated : 14:05 est , 31 october 2013 one man has taken on the role of protecting @entity4 from world - ending asteroids from his home observatory in @entity8			1
while the sky - watching base might look more rural and less impressive then the vast shiny centres seen in @entity11 films , @entity12 , 58 , now has the @entity16 ’s only earthbound asteroid and comet tracking station			1
every night he spends hours scouring the skies with a two - tonne telescope , monitoring large space rocks hurtling towards @entity4 and keeps a direct line to @entity22 free for emergencies			1
every night @entity12 and his wife spend hours scouring the skies with a two - tonne telescope ( pictured ) to monitor large space rocks hurtling towards @entity4			1
mr @entity12 , who lives in @entity27 , @entity8 , keeps a direct line to @entity22 free for emergencies using a global list of known asteroids , mr @entity12 observes their paths from his home observatory , which he shares with wife @entity35 in @entity36 , @entity27 , @entity8 , while a series of robotic telescopes comb the sky for others			1
a former @entity42 soldier , mr @entity12 has survived on his army pension for 15 years after taking up the armageddon - preventing position			1
he paid for the expensive equipment , which he chose and installed so that he can track the space rocks , by using his own savings , money from his pension and donations from people backing the cause			1
he said : ' it ’s not exactly a glamorous job , being an unknown protector , but someone has to do it and we are absolutely more than happy to step up			0
' of course it would be nice if we got paid for it , as an army pension does n’t pay much these days , but until then will we just keep on going			0
@entity12 , 58 , now has the @entity16 ¿ s only earthbound asteroid and comet tracking station and receives no funding for checking that asteroids are not on a collision path with @entity4 ( illustrated ) ' since the country needs a centre like this and there is no one else to do it , we decided we would take it on			1
' we have very good links with @entity22 - they ’re very much aware we ’re the only eyes on the sky in @entity77			1
' from their detached village home , @entity12 and mrs @entity78 operate the @entity81 , after @entity83 ’s @entity82 cut its project earlier this year			1
after failing to secure a £ 360,000 grant to probe the solar system and beyond for asteroids , the undeterred pair continued to operate			1
each morning they wake up , carry out any necessary maintenance and admin duties and conduct public tours for amateur astronomers and schoolchildren in the afternoon			0
using a global list of known asteroids , mr @entity12 ( pictured ) observes the paths of asteroids from his home observatory , which he shares with wife @entity35 in @entity36 , @entity27 , @entity8 , while a series of robotic telescopes comb the sky for others @entity104 , exhibition development manager at the @entity82 said the @entity83 - based centre operated the @entity107 ( @entity108 ) for 10 years under contract from the @entity16 government , which included daily monitoring of the risk from newly discovered asteroids and comets			1
' we produced regular reports to @entity117 on specific @entity118 [ near @entity4 objects ] that rated above zero on the @entity120 and issued a monthly close approach report , ' he told @entity122			2
in 2012 the @entity16 government took a decision to cease funding and the @entity108 at the @entity82 closed			2
a spokesman for the @entity126 said : ' even the very modest funds to support this activity could not be justified against a backdrop of reduced government funding and a growing emphasis on space for delivering growth to the economy			0
' mr @entity104 said : ' we gave permission to @entity12 at @entity16 to use the name @entity108			1
' but when the sun goes down the dedicated duo turn their attention skywards			0
mr @entity12 said : ' fortunately there are no known directly earthbound asteroids - that ’s where we come in and help to identify if there are			1
' we ’re currently tracking a number that may eventually come close , while the telescopes will hunt for new ones			0
' everyone knows the sheer calamity of an asteroid striking the earth - from the extinction of dinosaurs to the 1,600 people injured during a small shower in @entity157 , @entity158 , last year			2
' the @entity81 won the @entity159 for public engagement and planetary science this year			2
they are currently in the process of installing a 24inch six - and - a - half tonne @entity164 camera wide - field telescope so it can look for new hazards as well as track existing ones			1
the telescope is currently in storage , while the money is raised for a dome to house it			0
there is currently no @entity16 government funding for the trailing of asteroids and the couple are hoping to raise attention in the @entity16 , rather than pursuing help across the pond			2
mr @entity12 said : ' in the @entity16 there is absolutely no system set up ; there is nobody to telephone			1
pictured with his two - tonne telescope , mr @entity12 said it is about time that the @entity16 plays a part in the global asteroid - watching project			1
he said the country has no capability to spot smaller objects but an asteroid 50 metres across could obliterate an area the size of greater @entity197 ' we deal directly with @entity199 and would have to do the same if we wanted to get the word out			0
' the @entity16 does n’t play any part in the global project so it ’s about time they did			2
' we do not have the capability to spot smaller objects but something 50 metres across could completely take out an area the size of greater @entity197			0
' if something was heading towards us then a possible deflection mission could be mounted to stop it hitting the earth			0
' but it would be up to the @entity199 as we could n’t do anything about it here			0
' mr @entity12 uses a global list of known asteroids to decide which ones to pay close attention to			2
his @entity81 won the @entity159 for public engagement and planetary science this year as he and his wife show schoolchildren and amateur astronomers their ambitious project however , the picture is not too bleak			2
a spokesman for the @entity126 told @entity122 that amateur astronomers such as mr @entity12 are making ' significant discoveries			0
' he said that even school children are playing their part as students at @entity232 have recently installed a new observatory , which is being used to search for asteroids , among other celestial objects			0
the school has been congratulated by @entity238 astronaut , @entity237 who spent over 10 days in space as a lunar pilot in 1969			0
he said : ' i am very pleased to hear of this development and its potential use for detecting and tracking @entity118 ( @entity118 )			0
mr @entity12 , who is pictured here with a small telescope , said : ' we have very good links with @entity22 - they ¿ re very much aware we ¿ re the only eyes on the sky in @entity77 ' ' this is an issue that my fellow astronauts and cosmonauts in the @entity254 consider of prime importance and we welcome the contribution that your facility might make			1
' however , while volunteers are monitoring potential threats to life on @entity4 , there are no plans for an ' official ' @entity16 asteroid detection facility			1
the @entity126 spokesman said : ' the vast majority of @entity16 funding for space is channeled through the @entity268 ( @entity268 )			2
' the @entity268 does address @entity118 on behalf on its member states ... as it recognises they are a global hazard , not unique to any country and that they require an international response			0
' this is partly so countries can share the cost and because any solutions to asteroids on a collision course to earth require cohesive global action , he explained			0
speaking about mr @entity12 's role , he said : ' i consider @entity12 a professional in the field and he has a unique and valuable contribution to make			0
' although he may not have followed the normal route , he is a gifted communicator , a very savvy operator and his previous academic engagement on the issue brought much - needed intellectual rigour to the problem when the nascent @entity118 programmes were being developed in the late 90 's			0
he continues to act as a champion for the issue			0

@entity12 , 58 , now has @entity16 ’s only earthbound asteroid and comet tracking station called the @entity81 , which is based in @entity27 , @entity8
he and his wife spend hours scouring the skies with a two - tonne telescope to keep an eye on large space rocks hurtling towards @entity4
the pensioner failed to secure a £ 360,000 grant to monitor the asteroids , but has carried on anyway and has good links with @entity22
