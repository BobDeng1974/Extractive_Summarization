golfing fanatic @entity14 has collected more than 36,000 golf balls in his lifetime mr @entity14 's collection is so vast that he has custom - made furniture to store them , but they still spill out mr @entity14 's incredible collection features balls that belonged to @entity34 presidents such as @entity35 , sports stars like @entity37 and others stamped with famous courses from around the world			1

' i used to collect a few here and there then one day i asked my friend who collected balls he found on courses what he did with his logo balls and he started giving me his spares			2
' when he wanted to get rid of his collection of about 3,000 i bought them for $ 500 and things just escalated from there			0

and then i wanted universities			0
and then it was medical balls - hospitals , doctors , drug companies			0
and now i have just random brands - it 's impossible to categorise them			0
' there are probably a couple dozen or so from the @entity110 too which take pride of place during the @entity53			0
