by @entity0 published : 06:56 est , 25 march 2013 updated : 11:30 est , 25 march 2013 an overweight cook who started baking to avoid the shame of being seen buying cakes in public has lost 14 stone and made a career out of her new hobby			1
mother of three @entity9 , 42 and a self - confessed ' foodaholic ' , tipped the scales at 28 stone and became so obese she was unable to stand for more than ten minutes at a time and was laughed at by passers - by in the street			1
but despite being highly commended about the cakes she was making - including a thumbs up from the late restaurant critic @entity17 - @entity9 vowed to shed the pounds fearing she might not live long enough to see her children grow up			1
now she is half her original body weight and her dress size has shrunk from a 34 to a healthier size 14			2
she still bakes brownies and cakes but sells them instead of eating them herself			1
@entity9 who lives with husband @entity41 , 43 , a joiner , and their children , @entity45 , 16 , @entity39 , 15 , and @entity40 , 12 , revealed she still allowed herself the occasional treat in the form of her ' healthy ' brownies made from locally sourced eggs			1
@entity9 , from @entity50 , @entity51 , said : ' i was over-eating and it became a habit			1
i would say i am a recovering foodaholic - it 's an addiction			1
' i lived in a bubble			2
i 'd get up in the night and take painkillers and change my mattress because i could n't sleep			2
i used to have back aches and my poor husband used to have to massage my back every day			1
@entity9 seen here in 2008 when she was her heaviest , shrank from a size 34 for a size 14 @entity9 was inspired to sell her brownies after getting encouragement from @entity17 when she appeared on his tv show dining stars @entity9 's family , partner @entity41 and three children @entity40 , 8 , @entity45 12 , and @entity39 , 11 , all joined in the healthy eating regime @entity9 feared her obesity ( left ) would mean she would die of a heart attack before she slimmed down ( right ) ' people used to stare at me and laugh , but no one does that now			1
i can walk down the street without getting out of breath and more importantly i can play with my kids and get involved with them			2
' people look at you just to laugh at you when you 're big			2
then never open doors for you or speak nicely to you			2
they just think that your thick and lazy			2
@entity9 began comforting eating after @entity45 was diagnosed with @entity87 , and @entity40 was born with half a heart			1
but she decided to shed the pounds in the summer of 2008 after suffering really bad pains in her chest and struggling to breathe lying down in bed			2
@entity9 said : ' i could n't even stand up for 10 minutes let alone run anywhere			1
i used to drink @entity93 all the time for my heartburn and had to sleep with a cushion between my knees			0
@entity9 with celebrity chef @entity17 , who inspired her to sell her brownies , and whom she kept in contact with until his death @entity9 ran the @entity103 last year			1
she started running after dropping the first 10 stone through walking and diet alone ' i never slept properly either			1
one night i was lying there thinking that i literally could have a heart attack at any point - i was over 28 stone			0
i knew i could n't keep that weight up much longer			0
you do n't see really fat elderly people do you ? ' ' whilst i lay there wheezing for a breath , all i could think about was two of my three children who have serious health problems , and there 's me stuffing my face creating a problem			0
' my children have been through so much and yet i was being selfish to my family as i may leave them without a mother if i continued overeating			0
' throughout their hospital appointments and operations i would be there at their bedsides comfort eating just so i could try and take the pain away			0
@entity9 began comforting eating after @entity45 ( far left ) was diagnosed with @entity87 , and @entity40 ( centre ) was born with half a heart @entity9 still allows herself the occasional treat in the form of her ' healthy ' brownies made from locally sourced eggs ' i did n't realise that i would lose 14 stone though , i set myself small goals all the way through			1
i would never have done it otherwise			0
' so out went the cheese , crisps , chocolate , sweets and her beloved sugary cakes and in came healthy steamed vegetables , grilled chicken and fish , and healthy curries			1
she said : ' my three kids and @entity41 all got involved with the healthy eating			0
i always used to cook them good meals ; it was just the portion sizes that were ridiculous			0
' for exercise i simply chose to walk because it 's free - unlike the gym			0
that 's pretty much all i did exercise-wise for the first 10 stone			0
i 'd go off for an hour on my own			0
i run a lot now , as opposed to walking			0
' rather than just eating rubbish all day , i eat @entity167 for breakfast with skimmed milk and then a healthy smoothie			1
' for our family tea we 'll have a chilli con carne or coronation chicken			0
i also stopped eating after 6pm and would keep a sports bottle of low cal juice next to me to drink			0
' despite her diet @entity9 was inspired to continue baking chocolate brownies after she got a thumbs up from @entity17 when she appeared on his tv show dining stars			1
@entity9 who hosts cookery classes at the @entity182 in @entity183 said : ' i 've always loved baking and decided that i did n't want to go to the shop and buy cakes all the time and have people looking at me so i used to bake them			1
' @entity17 was really lovely			0
for the show i made prawn cocktail , beef wellington and a strawberry pavlova , but he said he wanted me to bake him my brownies			2
' he said to me , " these are the best i have ever tasted			0
" from then i kept in contact with him right up until his death			0
he said to me , " @entity199 , you know that you have to bake those brownies and sell them			2
