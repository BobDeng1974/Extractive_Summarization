control over £ 6billion in health spending could be handed to @entity2 in a national first			1
chancellor @entity4 is expected to announce the radical plan , which will see all @entity7 funding devolved from @entity8 to the region , later this week			1
it is part of the creation of a powerful new body covering the whole of @entity2 , but critics warn that a time of intense pressure on @entity7 budgets it could be a ' poisoned chalice ' for the region			1
' hospitals across @entity2 , including @entity20 in @entity21 , could be funded locally under radical plans to devolve health spending under the deal , full control health spending - worth £ 6billion - a - year - will be devolved to @entity2			1
a leaked draft memorandum of understanding includes the creation of a new board to distribute funding and take decisions in areas such as personnel , regulation , information - sharing and @entity7 buildings			1
it would work closely with existing clinical commissioning groups ( @entity36 ) of @entity37			0
in a surprise move the transfer of @entity7 funding to 10 local councils would happen very quickly , taking effect from april next year			1
chancellor @entity4 said today : ' we 're discussing a plan for bringing together the @entity7 and social care in @entity2 so we provide better care for patients			1
' this is exactly what we want to see more of in our health care			0
it 's also about giving @entity2 more control over things run in @entity2 - which is what our vision of a northern powerhouse is all about			2
' it 's early days , but i think it 's a really exciting development			0
we 'll be working hard now with @entity2 and @entity61 on getting the details right so the arrangements work best for patients			2
' the region has already accepted the creation of a powerful ' metro mayor ' in return for taking over responsibility for transport , skills and housebuilding and the right to recoup some money generated by growth			2
the @entity76 ( @entity76 ) eventually hopes for full devolution of all £ 22billion of public spending in the city			0
but any move to combine health budgets - currently held by @entity61 - with councils ' existing social care duties had been thought to be some way down the line			2
however , devolving health spending to local areas could risk creating ' postcode lotteries ' with differing levels of care and clinical priorities			0
@entity7 @entity61 's chief executive @entity92 said : ' @entity61 is working on this ground - breaking offer to the local @entity7 in @entity2 , working in partnership with elected local authorities			1
' the @entity7 five - year forward view says we want to back local leaders and communities who come together to improve health care of their residents and patients			1
while this new model wo n't necessarily be right for many other parts of @entity61 , for @entity2 the time is right and conditions are right for shared success			0
' in a speech in @entity2 last month , @entity4 promised to hand control over spending and growth to the north west @entity114 , assistant director of the @entity115 think tank , said that a full transfer of responsibility would be a reform ' on a breathtaking scale ' but could pose serious risks			1
he warned that taking money away from @entity122 and @entity61 to give it to councils was on ' the nuclear end of the spectrum and raises all sorts of questions and risks '			0
he told @entity129 's today programme : ' depending on the detail - and the detail is really crucial and we do n't have that yet - you could either see this as a triumph for local democracy or creating real risks of yet another reorganisation of the @entity7 when it 's barely recovered from the last one			2
' with the @entity7 ' heading for the financial rocks ' , there were also concerns about accountability and financial risk with the @entity7 , he said			0
' if the plan is to give the money to local government , the words ' chalice ' and ' poisoned ' perhaps spring to mind			0
' the post of police and crime commissioner for @entity154 - established by the coalition government - will also be scrapped in favour of the new mayor			0
mr @entity4 has hailed extended powers for cities as a key part of efforts to create a ' northern powerhouse ' to rival @entity163 economically .			0

@entity4 expected to announce radical plan later this week
new health board would make decisions on spending , staff and buildings
major shift in control from @entity175 could happen from april next year
comes ahead of creation of a @entity179 - style mayor for @entity2
intense pressure on @entity7 budgets mean difficult decisions need to be made
