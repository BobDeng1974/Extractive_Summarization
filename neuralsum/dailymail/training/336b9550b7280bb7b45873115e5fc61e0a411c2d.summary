by @entity0 published : 11:08 est , 24 september 2013 updated : 11:08 est , 24 september 2013 films that layer many plots and relationships on top of one another , such as @entity3 , push our brains to breaking point , a new study suggests			0
scientists say that ' hyperlink films ' such as the @entity14 hit as well as grittier titles such as @entity16 that follow a number of stories in parallel throughout , require a lot of brain power to understand due to the number of emotional relationships that the viewer needs to keep track of			1
hyperlink films reflect patterns that can be seen in social networks , but the number of storylines they can feature is restricted due to the limitations of the human brain			2
scientists say that ' hyperlink films ' such as @entity3 ( pictured ) - that follow a number of stories in parallel throughout - require a lot of brain power to understand			1
this is due to the number of emotional relationships that the viewer needs to keep track of hyperlink films , such as @entity3 ( pictured ) reflect patterns that can be seen in social networks , but the number of storylines they can feature is restricted due to the limitations of the human brain they use cinematic devices such as flashbacks , interspersing scenes out of chronological order , split screens and voiceovers to squeeze as many storylines into one film as possible , creating complex layered plots			1
@entity60 dr @entity59 of @entity61 , said : ' because of our evolved psychology , humans can not break through the cognitive glass ceiling that naturally limits our ability to handle social relationships , or to understand complex interpersonal dramas			0
' films such as @entity3 , crash or @entity70 follow similar rules to regular social groups , according to dr @entity59 and his colleague professor @entity75 of @entity76			1
existing work in the field has shown that someone can generally maintain a maximum of 150 friends and acquaintances in a regular social group , which breaks down into four or five in a ' support group ' , 12 to 15 people in a ' sympathy group ' and 30 to 50 people in an ' affinity group ' with the rest as acquaintances			1
for the study published in the journal @entity94 , the team analysed 12 hyperlink films and 10 female interest conventional films and found they all followed rules that can be seen in the real world			2
dr @entity59 and professor @entity75 found that an average hyperlink film contains 31.4 characters that were central to the plot , similar in size to someone 's affinity group in modern society			1
they also analysed works of @entity108 which had approximately 28 characters per play , which similarly reflects a less intimate social set - up			0
dr @entity59 believes hyperlink films fail when they try to copy reality but push viewers too far by involving too many characters			0
this shortfall in our ability to keep up with more relationships than we do in reality means that , despite virtual social networks like @entity122 our brains have not evolved to handle so many friends on the other hand , ' female interest films ' had a smaller cast of around 20 relevant characters on average - which is in the range of a conventional sympathy group and reflects female social networks in real life , according to the pair			2
dr @entity59 believes that the hyperlink films copy reality and fail when they try to push viewers too far by involving too many characters			0
this shortfall in our ability to keep up with more relationships than we do in reality means that , despite virtual social networks like @entity122 and @entity141 giving us the tools to maintain large social groups , out brains have not evolved to handle them , they claimed			0
professor @entity75 said : ' despite the promise it holds , digital and other new media may not help us engineer social networks or social cohesion on a larger scale , because our minds simply can not understand or handle the mind states of more than a handful of people at once			0
' films such as @entity70 ( pictured ) follow similar rules to regular social groups , the researchers said			1
existing work found that someone can generally maintain a maximum of 150 acquaintances which breaks down into four or five in a ' support group ' , 12 to 15 people in a ' sympathy group ' and 30 to 50 people in an ' affinity group '			0

scientists believe ' hyperlink films ' that follow *multiple* stories in parallel are harder to understand due to the number of emotional relationships in them
the research by @entity61 and the @entity182 found films such as @entity184 follow similar rules to regular social groups
an average hyperlink film contains 31.4 characters central to the plot , similar in size to someone 's ' affinity group ' in modern society
