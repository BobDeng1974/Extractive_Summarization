by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 06:24 est , 14 february 2013 updated : 19:08 est , 14 february 2013 new role : @entity3 , the executive in charge of @entity5 when the @entity7 controversy erupted the @entity5 ’s most high - profile woman executive is moving to a new job just days before the release of explosive transcripts into the @entity13 ’s handling of the @entity15 scandal			1
@entity3 , formerly director of news , is to become director of radio following months of speculation about her future			1
the switch is technically a sideways move for @entity22 , 56 , although some regard running the huge news operation as the bigger role			0
confirmation of her move comes shortly before the @entity5 publishes thousands of pages of evidence used by former head of @entity33 @entity32 in his report into why @entity35 ditched an investigation into @entity7			1
miss @entity3 , 56 , had been criticised in the report for failing to tackle the ‘ virtual meltdown ’ in parts of the news department			1
the testimonies , emails and texts are expected to be published at the end of next week and insiders admit that some of them may be embarrassing to a number of senior @entity5 executives			1
miss @entity3 , who has been in charge of @entity5 since 2004 , was told last week that incoming director general @entity50 would like her to move to radio and yesterday the @entity5 confirmed this will take place after @entity53			1
miss @entity3 , a former controller of @entity54 , said : ‘ it is a huge pleasure to be returning to my first love of radio			1
the @entity58 public love @entity59 and i intend to cherish and champion it			0
’ change : former culture secretary @entity62 , right , is to join the @entity5 in a major strategic role			1
the appointments have been made by incoming director - general @entity50 , left , before he takes up his position together : @entity7 and @entity3 are pictured at the @entity66 in @entity67 in december 2006 at the height of the @entity70 crisis she temporarily ‘ stepped aside ’ from her £ 340,000 a year role , and it was later revealed she had at one point offered to resign			1
there is speculation that the former editor of @entity77 , @entity78 , will be handed her former post			0
mr @entity50 said of his appointments to the senior management team : ' i am building a senior team that will define the @entity5 and public service broadcasting for the next decade			1
' it will be a team that is made up of outstanding talent from outside the @entity5 combined with the best people from within			1
' there will be more changes over the coming months and there is a lot of hard work ahead but today 's appointments are the first steps in delivering that vision			0
' there will also be changes to the role which acting director - general @entity100 will take on in april when mr @entity50 arrives			0
mr @entity50 was appointed director - general following the resignation of @entity103 , after just 54 days in the job			1
mr @entity103 quit , saying that as editor - in chief he had to take ' ultimate responsibility ' for a @entity35 investigation that had led to the former @entity109 treasurer , @entity108 , being wrongly accused of child abuse			1
change of direction : @entity3 is understood to have previously been offered the job by the then director general @entity103 , who left in november ( seen here resigning next to @entity113 , ) but turned it down mr @entity100 - formerly the director of @entity5 audio and music - will become ceo of the corporation 's commercial arm @entity120 , and this role is being expanded to include ' a more strategic global perspective '			1
this will involve developing the @entity5 's international brand and editorial strategy			2
mr @entity100 said : ' i am very pleased to take on the important task of building the @entity5 brand globally and leading a growing , creative @entity120			2
' @entity129 and 6 music controller @entity130 had been an early favourite for the radio role , which was previously held by @entity100			0
as director of news , miss @entity3 was responsible for more than 8,000 staff and was in charge of all of the broadcaster ’s news and current affairs output , including @entity140 , @entity141 , the @entity142 and @entity35			2
ms @entity3 said : ' it is a huge pleasure to be returning to my first love of radio			2
i look forward to working with our outstanding controllers and some of the most creative on and off air talent in the @entity5 ' it is known that she told mr @entity103 – then running @entity151 – at an awards lunch last year that @entity35 was planning to run a report about claims that @entity7 abused young girls , which could affect mr @entity103 ’s plans for @entity158 shows paying tribute to the presenter			1
in a memo to news staff , ms @entity3 said that her move was a ' bittersweet moment ' , as she listed some of the notable moments in output during her tenure in news			2
they included coverage of the @entity173 tsunami , the banking crisis , the conflicts in @entity176 and @entity177 , the @entity178 , the edition of @entity140 featuring @entity181 leader @entity180 and the hunt for gunman @entity183 , as well as the @entity185 relay			0
she wrote : ' i confess that it is a bittersweet moment for me			0
everyone knows that i love radio and always have			0
so naturally i genuinely relish returning to this cherished and uniquely creative part of the @entity5 , especially under a new @entity190 ( director - general ) who is passionate about its importance			2
' but leaving @entity5 and all of you is undoubtedly a wrench			2
i believe i may be the longest serving @entity196 over the past 25 years			0
' she added : ' it has been a huge privilege and an absolute pleasure to lead you			0
' sources at @entity35 have also suggested that she warned the programme ’s then editor , @entity203 – who has also since stepped aside – that he needed to be sure of his facts before screening any claims that @entity7 was a criminal			1
she resumed her role as director of @entity5 in december after further blunders - caused by a change in the chain of command in news while an inquiry was ongoing - led to @entity108 being wrongly identified as being involved in a sexual abuse scandal			2
she began at the corporation almost 30 years ago , working as a news producer at @entity219 before going on to work as a reporter and then editor of @entity54 ’s @entity222 , and as a presenter on @entity224			0
she took responsibility for business programmes on the station in 1997 and was made station controller three years later			0
fiercely defensive of the station ’s ‘ intelligent ’ programming that ‘ feeds the mind ’ she helped it to reach audiences of 10million for the first time			0
despite running @entity54 during another @entity5 crisis – when an infamous today programme report sparked the @entity238 – she escaped censure because the show is governed by the @entity5 division			2
in the wake of the scandal @entity22 was promoted to become said division ’s first female director in 2004			0
last year she applied to become director general but was beaten by mr @entity103			0
it is understood she was offered a senior role in radio instead , but turned it down			0
ms @entity3 said @entity250 would become acting director of news from march 19			0
she took that position during the period in which ms @entity3 stepped aside .			1
