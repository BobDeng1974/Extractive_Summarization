anything to declare by @entity1 stopped by @entity5 officers , @entity3 notoriously said he had nothing to declare but his genius			1
other passengers , as @entity8 hilariously recounts , try to sneak through the red and green channels considerably more heavily laden			1
@entity1 says he ‘ would n’t trust a nun with a crutch ’ ( stock image ) during his long career as a @entity5 specialist at @entity22 airports , @entity1 has had ‘ to politely listen to people lying through their teeth at you ’ as they attempt to smuggle in snakes , bush meat ( zebra , lion , gorilla ) , combs that double as flick - knives , a monkey sewn into the lining of a coat , another monkey ‘ disguised as a hairy child ’ , corpses ‘ propped up in a wheelchair wearing wonky sunglasses ’ and a box of dry ice containing a man ’s buttock , apparently sliced off by a samurai sword			1
hospitals were put on the alert to look out for ‘ anyone who had trouble sitting down ’			1
as they riffle through travellers ’ bags , @entity1 and his team frequently detect drugs : socks impregnated with heroin , cannabis resin in shoes , soup cans or barrels of bitumen			1
drugs are often hidden in hollowed - out disposable lighters , aa batteries that unscrew to reveal a stash inside and shaving cream aerosols cleverly made to still squirt real foam out of the top			1
once , @entity1 found a pack of 12 brightly coloured lipsticks , ‘ where every lipstick was actually moulded from cocaine paste			1
the cardboard lining of suitcases or sports bags , originating in @entity73 , often contained 20 compressed sheets of lsd tabs , worth £ 10,000 on the street			0
to deter the @entity5 inspections , smugglers sometimes litter their luggage with hypodermic needles or razor blades			0
what @entity1 looks out for are people whose passports show frequent trips being made to drug - source countries			1
flights paid for in bundles of cash can be suspicious			0
also do n’t stroll around too flashily dressed : ‘ it is better to look scruffily right than too smartly wrong , ’ he says			1
it ’s amazing how many drug - dealers try to behave like drug - dealers in a film			0
by and large , the @entity5 officers would sooner ‘ nab some nob on a private plane who thinks it allows him to sneak in a suitcase of cocaine than some kid from the @entity100 with a spliff in his sock ’ — though do n’t let that make you feel over-confident			1
one of the hallmarks of a tip - top inspector is that he ‘ would n’t trust a nun with a crutch ’ — and no wonder			1
they are always confronting nuns smuggling in gin disguised as litre bottles of holy water — ‘ another miracle ! ’ the worst part of the job , however , is the strip - search			1
‘ every single hiding place and hole in the human body has , at one time , been used by smugglers			2
’ @entity1 has to snap on his marigolds and wait for the ‘ swallowers ’ and ‘ stuffers ’ to void condoms filled with drugs into the lavatory pan			1
‘ it becomes a waiting game , ’ he says , philosophically			1
yet such criminals are easy to spot			0
‘ you try walking normally with half - a - kilo of drugs up your jacksy			1
’ there ’s me thinking everyone arriving from @entity140 had piles			2
it is not only narcotics , of course			0
@entity1 ’s job is to detect and confiscate weapons , child porn videos , pirated medicines and counterfeit art. he has seen mobile phones containing tiny pistols and stun guns , and straw camels and donkeys from @entity154 and @entity155 crammed with used hospital bandages			1
he has to collect the duty due on imported diamonds , fur coats and @entity160 watches			0
contraband is destroyed , valuables handed to the @entity162 and booze poured away			0
‘ the airport drains probably had the only alcoholic rats in the country			2
’ on one occasion , @entity1 had to board a @entity170 aircraft from @entity171 , where a rat the size of a @entity175 pony had been glimpsed in the hold			1
though the police went in with their @entity180 automatic rifles , it was @entity1 who did the deed , bashing the monster with a @entity185 garden spade			2
as ‘ death by rabies is a nasty way to go ’ , our quarantine rules are strict			2
@entity1 also says that they look out for those strolling through the airport in flashy clothing , because he says ‘ it is better to look scruffily right than too smartly wrong ' @entity1 often has to do battle with rich folks in private @entity199 jets who think their pets are exempt — one lot even had the gall to suggest they were on their way to @entity206 to shoot grouse with the @entity208			1
if their dog mixed with the corgis , @entity1 patiently explained , then the corgis also would have to be destroyed			2
horses , incidentally , are tricky animals to ship			0
they get so nervous and frightened , it is not unknown for them to bite their trainer ’s fingers clean off at the knuckle			0
corpses are n’t given much peace , either			0
did you know that if you croak abroad , it can cost £ 4,500 to repatriate the body , which has to be embalmed and secured in a zinc coffin ? ( hence the wheelchair and sunglasses gambit — cheaper			0
) as coffins are ‘ a good vehicle for contraband importation ’ , these have to be rigorously searched — a ghoulish task , especially if the deceased ’s arm shoots up and its wig falls off			2
and it is also not unknown for stowaways in the hold to be crushed by the retracting undercarriage — and to drop onto the runway at @entity242 several hours later as a block of ice			0
no wonder , to ease the tension , @entity5 officers play wicked pranks on each other			0
‘ never fly into the airport where you also work ’ is the strong advice			2
otherwise , you can come back from @entity253 and your luggage will have been replaced on the carousel with concrete blocks			0
eventually , @entity1 was upgraded from the rubber gloves to work in undercover surveillance			2
this meant the painstaking study of airline computer systems , which give details of ticket payments and full details of a passenger ’s travel			0
( @entity267 and freedom of movement ? forget it			0
they know where we are , where we ’ve been and where we are all going			0
) the @entity273 , which follows international drugs cartels and involves ‘ info gathering and smuggling ops ’ , is based in a @entity278 building near @entity279 , built in the days of old - fashioned pirates and ships flying the @entity283 flag			1
here , @entity1 had to serve alongside @entity284 and @entity285			2
the doings of the @entity288 sound like the plot of a @entity291 movie — with traces of @entity293 thrown in			0
further jaunty volumes of reminiscence are promised .			0
