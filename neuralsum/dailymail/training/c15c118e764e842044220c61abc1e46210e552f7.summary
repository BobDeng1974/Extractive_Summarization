by @entity1 reporter published : 15:52 est , 1 october 2013 updated : 16:28 est , 1 october 2013 a former state trooper has returned to court today to plead not guilty for the third time in the murders of his wife and two young children			1
@entity9 , an ex-law enforcement officer from @entity10 , is charged with shooting dead his wife , seven - year - old son and daughter , five , in 2000 in a car at their @entity16 home			1
the 49 - year - old has always insisted that he is innocent of the brutal slayings			2
he was found guilty in 2002 and 2006 but both convictions were overturned on appeal			1
in 2005 , dna on a sweatshirt from the scene was tied to @entity40 who had done time for burglary			0
he was convicted on three counts of murder and sentenced to 225 years			0
the former state trooper has spent a majority of the past 13 years behind bars			1
the @entity9 slayings are one of @entity10 ’s longest - running murder cases , following a tangled legal path riddled with missing murder weapons , allegations of affairs and child abuse , the emergence of a second suspect and a prosecutor ’s removal over a book deal			1
jury selection began in august with prosecution and defense weeding out people with prejudice over either @entity9 's guilt or innocence			2
the trial was moved to @entity69 in hopes that an impartial jury could be found			0
the slayings occurred more than 100 miles away at the family 's @entity16 home			2
@entity9 insists he was wrongly convicted , and this trial is another chance to clear his name			2
for @entity81 and @entity82 , @entity80 's parents , this is another shot at closure			1
' it ’s like that movie @entity86 , where he keeps waking up to the same thing every day , ’ mr @entity84 said			0
bloody tragedy : @entity80 , 35 ( right ) , her son , @entity91 , age 7 ( left ) , and daughter @entity94 ( center ) , age 5 , were discovered shot dead in the garage of their home in september 2000 for years , a debate has raged over whether @entity9 is a villain or a victim , with both sides taking to websites , books and national television to argue their points			1
a petition on @entity108 seeking to have him freed has collected hundreds of signatures			0
another challenge for prosecutors is making a legal argument that resonates with jurors after the two previous failures			0
@entity9 , who had left the state police four months before his family was killed , was arrested a few days after telling investigators he had discovered his wife and their two children shot to death in the garage of their @entity16 home september 8 , 2000			1
the weapon was never found			0
defense attorneys argued at @entity9 ’s first trial in 2002 that prosecutors ignored evidence that another man had been in the garage where killings occurred			1
after @entity130 linked a violent ex-convict to the scene , they thought @entity9 would be freed			2
instead , prosecutors said @entity9 had conspired with the second man to kill his family , and he was convicted again in 2006			1
the second man , @entity40 , is serving a 225 - year prison sentence for murder and conspiracy to commit murder			0
legal fumbles : @entity9 ( center ) has been found guilty twice , but both convictions were later overturned on appeal conspiracy theory : ex-con @entity40 ( left ) was convicted of the murders and sentenced to 225 years in prison , but the prosecution believes he was acting alongside @entity9 ( right ) @entity40 ’s palm print was found on @entity80 ’s suv , and a sweatshirt found in the garage had been issued to @entity40 in prison while he was serving time for armed robbery and criminal confinement			1
both times , appellate courts ruled that prosecutors had deliberately inflamed the jury , in the first trial by calling a dozen women who testified they had extramarital affairs with @entity9 , and in the second by suggesting he had molested his daughter without any evidence to back up those statements			2
the third trial is expected to last at least six weeks amid heightened security at the @entity168 , about 25 miles northwest of @entity169			0
@entity171 prosecutor @entity170 , who won the second murder conviction against @entity9 , wo n’t be there			2
he was removed after signing a book deal regarding @entity9 ’s case , though he said the deal later was dropped			2
the @entity177 plan to be in court , hoping for closure and a chance to heal			0
‘ hopefully one day we 'll wake up and this will never have happened			0
but common sense tells you it wo n’t be that way , ’ mr @entity84 said			0
crime scene : @entity9 told investigators that he returned from a game of basketball on the night of september 28 , 2000 , and discovered his family slain in the garage of their @entity16 , @entity10 , home resting place : the grave site of @entity80 and her two young children , @entity197 and @entity94 both @entity9 and @entity198 were born and raised in @entity199 , @entity10			1
the two met in 1988 and got married a year later - three years after @entity9 had divorced his first wife			1
also in 1989 , @entity9 was accepted into the @entity202 as a trooper recruit			2
the young couple had their first child , @entity91 , in 1993 , followed by @entity94 in 1995			1
according to some accounts , the @entity208 ' relationship took a turn for the worse shortly after the birth of their son , with the husband allegedly starting an affair with another woman , which culminated with him briefly moving out of the house			0
by the time their daughter was born , however , the @entity208 ’ life appeared to be back on track			0
the family finished construction on their new house on @entity226 in @entity16 , and things were seemingly going well , with @entity9 serving as a state trooper with the @entity229 , and his wife advancing her career as a well - paid financial analyst			1
in march 2000 , about four months before the killings , @entity233 resigned from his post with the state police and went to work for his uncle , who owned a basement waterproofing business			0
september 28 , 2000 , began like most days in the @entity9 household , with @entity80 waking up at 6am , followed by @entity9 and their kids a short time later			1
the husband kissed his family goodbye and left for work			0
about an hour later , mrs @entity80 headed out with the children , dropping off @entity91 at his elementary school and @entity94 at her pre-school			1
after making arrangements with her parents to stop by later in the day , @entity80 drove to her work at @entity251			0
at around 4pm , she left to pick up her daughter from school and take her to dance practice			0
after 6pm , @entity80 took her son to his swimming practice at @entity257			0
shortly after 7pm , the @entity208 set out for home , located about 11 miles away			0
meanwhile , @entity9 left work just before 7pm and drove to a nearby church , where he arranged to play a pickup game of basketball with a group of friends			0
costly case : it is estimated that by the time @entity9 's third trial reaches its conclusion , the state will have spent $ 4million in taxpayers ' money on the case grieving parents : @entity82 , left , and @entity84 hold a photograph of their daughter @entity80 in their @entity199 home seeking closure : in an undated photo , @entity82 and @entity84 , center , are seen in a family portrait from @entity283 of 1999 with their daughters @entity80 , left , @entity286 , right , and their grandchildren @entity94 and @entity288 just before 9.30pm , @entity289 placed a frantic call with the @entity291 , where he had worked for 10 years , reporting that he found his wife and children shot dead in the garage of their home			1
the prosecution , however , rejected @entity9 ’s version of events , accusing him of murdering his family in order to pursue affairs with other women			1
during his first trial , the 11 people who took part in the basketball pickup game on the night of september 28 testified in @entity9 's defense , telling jurors that he was at the gym at the time of the murders			0
but the prosecutors claimed that @entity9 could have sneaked out to meet up with ex-convict @entity40 and kill his family			2
@entity9 was convicted the first time in 2002 , but the verdict was thrown out two years later , the @entity313 reported			1
he was found guilty a second time in 2006 - a conviction that was also overturned on appeal in 2009 , when the @entity318 ruled that prosecutors inflamed the jury by making baseless accusations that @entity9 had molested his daughter			1
it is estimated that by the time @entity9 's third trial reaches its conclusion , the state will have spent $ 4million in taxpayers ' money on the case .			2

@entity9 , 49 , was found guilty in 2002 and 2006 , but both convictions were overturned
the former state trooper has insisted for the past 13 years that he is not guilty of murdering his family
@entity80 and her children , @entity91 , 7 , and @entity94 , 5 , were found shot dead in car at their @entity10 home
