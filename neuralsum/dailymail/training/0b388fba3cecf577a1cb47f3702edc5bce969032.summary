by @entity0 an astronaut spending time alone on the @entity2 gazes out into the cosmos when , suddenly , they feel themselves being hugged			2
no , this is n’t the plot for a space romance movie , rather , it ’s a scenario envisaged by @entity9 in @entity10			1
as part of a @entity13 contest they ’ve designed a spacesuit that can not only simulate the feeling of being hugged , but also give an astronaut live information about their home town			1
a team from @entity10 has won one of the categories in @entity13 's @entity23 by designing a prototype spacesuit for future astronauts ( pictured with founder @entity26 inside )			1
the design includes inflatable shoulders that can be used to give the astronaut a ' wearable hug ' the contest is an annual @entity13 - run event called the @entity23			1
taking place over two days in cities around the world , the contest sees teams attempt to solve problems related to both life on @entity39 and space with open - source solutions			1
@entity42 , currently training with @entity43 , will be the first @entity44 astronaut to visit the iss when he launches in november 2015			1
the first briton in space was @entity46 in november 1989 , who also became the first woman to visit the @entity50 ’s @entity49			2
no other solely @entity44 people have been to space , although there have been some with dual citizenship			2
of these four were @entity44 - @entity55 : @entity56 ( nine missions ) , @entity58 ( three missions ) , @entity60 ( two missions ) and @entity61 ( one paid mission )			0
and one other , @entity63 , is a @entity65 - @entity64 who also paid to go to space			2
these take place within five themes : @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74			0
the team from the @entity9 , calling themselves the @entity76 , were taking part in a project to create wearable technologies for future astronauts at the @entity82 ’s site in @entity83			1
to do so they consulted with @entity44 astronaut @entity42 , who is set to travel to the @entity2 on a 6 - month mission in november 2015			1
their final design , the team says , was to create a suit that was both uniquely useful for astronauts on the iss but also with applications on @entity39			1
the most interesting innovation was the ‘ wearable hug ’ feature			2
a family member on @entity39 could activate inflatable material in the shoulders of the suit to give the astronaut a simulated hug and let them know they ’re being thought of			2
video courtesy of @entity9 the spacesuit designed by @entity9 has a number of innovations designed for future astronauts			1
these include inflatable shoulders that can simulate a ' hug ' and a set of leds on the wrist that tell the astronaut what the weather is like back home			0
in the right image you can see the pack used to power it the project was undertaken by a group of students of all ages at the @entity82 's site in @entity83 under the auspices of the @entity125 ( with the temporary name of the @entity76 ) , while @entity44 astronaut in training @entity42 provided additional support via video chat ( pictured ) meanwhile , on the sleeve of the suit is a vision board that displays live weather status for the wearer ’s home location			1
and in the pocket they envisage a future 3d printer that can instantly deliver tools , parts and gifts directly to the astronaut			0
another innovative feature would be a mission patch that people on @entity39 can wear			0
this would light up with embedded leds when the @entity2 passes overhead			0
the team says this same technology could be used for other purposes , such as providing updates as to when a football team scores a goal			0
their project was named the overall global winner of the @entity157 category			0
and the company hopes some of their ideas will go into a spacesuit to be worn by @entity42 when he undertakes his mission to the @entity2 the contest is an annual @entity13 - run event called the @entity23			1
taking place over two days in cities around the world , the contest sees teams attempt to solve problems related to both life on @entity39 and space with open - source solutions ' a scientist would not have come up with the idea of a wearable hug , that was one of the fashion student ’s ideas , ’ @entity26 , one of the founders of the @entity125 , told the @entity179			1
‘ a lot of people assume that only scientists can do useful stuff and that is not right			0
it ’s about working in collaboration with people			0
‘ no one person can achieve anything on their own			0
it ’s all about exploration and ideas			0
‘ we ’re delighted to have won			0
while we ’re proud leaders of the project , it was a truly collaborative effort and is further evidence of the power of art , play and storytelling to inspire engagement with science			2
' the support we received in particular from the @entity82 and the @entity205 at @entity206 was inspirational			0
' @entity42 , meanwhile , added : ‘ the @entity76 is great			1
their approach to inspiring children about science is rigorous , fun and it works			0
' i ’m proud to serve with them on their mission to inspire the next generation of scientists and space explorers			2

@entity125 wins @entity13 contest to design a new spacesuit
their effort allows astronauts to experience ' wearable hugs ' while in space
the competition was part of @entity13 's @entity23
this sees teams around the world compete in a variety of subject areas
@entity9 hope their suit may be used by @entity42 in 2015
