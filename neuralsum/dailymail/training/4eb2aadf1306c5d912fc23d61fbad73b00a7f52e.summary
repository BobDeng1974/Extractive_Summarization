@entity18 used pictures from photo archiving site @entity60 to complete the collection , which he calls @entity62 a @entity63 , or @entity64 to the past			1

the collection sees 1960 meet 2013 at the @entity29 lookout over @entity17 's @entity30			2

@entity104 city : it may look like @entity17 is being invaded in this 1980 picture of people parachuting close to the @entity108 , but the sky is a lot clearer in the 2011 shot picturesque : the @entity113 is pictured back in 1976 and later in 2012 generation gap : the difference between fashions and even the prams in use is clear inthese images of central @entity17 from 1972 and 2013 @entity120 : @entity122 junction , opposite the @entity123 is pictured with a tank on the road in 1956 and later in 2012 another seamlessly contrasted image highlights the difference in fashions between 1900 and 2013			0

the difference between 20th and 21st century @entity16 is perhaps best illustrated by a picture of a tram crashed in @entity139 in 1956 set against the same square today			0
though the picture shows that the public transport system has n't changed much , one of @entity17 's beautiful buildings captured in the background of the shot is now occupied by a @entity147 's			2
