published : 06:59 est , 7 january 2014 updated : 08:04 est , 7 january 2014 recipes , cures and handy hints from a @entity5 housewife have been given a new lease of life on the internet			1
over the years , @entity9 , born in 1893 , noted down all her recipes for cakes , cures , medicines , furniture polishes and handy hints from days gone by in elegantly - written @entity5 handwriting			1
and she left this treasure trove of handy hints to her granddaughter - in - law @entity18 when she died in 1970			1
mrs @entity9 used the book ( which she 's holding in the picture ) handed down to her from her husband 's grandmother to make cakes for her children and grandchildren - but in 2007 decided she wanted to share @entity27 's legacy with others and publish it - the result was @entity27 's @entity30 among the recipes is her improbable ' cake determined by weight of the egg '			1
weigh an egg , then take equal quantities of sugar , butter , rice flour , and vanilla essence , mix and bake			1
a tablespoon of boiling water added to sponge mix makes lighter sponge cakes			1
to help green vegetables keep their colour boil in the pan without the lid			1
the best way of making curdled custard smooth is to stand it in a pan of cold water and beat with an egg whisk until smooth			1
to prevent skin forming on boiled milk , cover the pan with a plate or saucer , thus saving all the goodness			2
when making oatmeal porridge or cooking rice , if the pot is greased with lard or butter first it is much easier to clean			2
mrs @entity9 has since used the book to make cakes for her children and grandchildren - but in 2007 decided she wanted to share @entity27 's legacy with others and make it into a book - @entity27 's @entity30			1
in may a publisher got in touch with her and said they would take the book on			2
it 's currently available on @entity80 as a @entity82 download			1
a donation from every book sold is going to the @entity85 in @entity86			2
@entity27 's recipes are all in original imperial measurements , and rely on basic equipment and elbow grease			1
favourites include @entity92 , @entity93 , jams and preserves , @entity96 , lemonade and ginger wine			2
mrs @entity9 said : ' she was the only girl and was born in @entity99 in 1893 but moved to @entity100 after her mum died			1
over the years , while baking and cooking for her family , she documented all her tips and tricks in her little recipe book			2

she was a @entity121 - fearing , straight - laced person who would n't stand for any messing - but she had a wicked sense of humour			2
