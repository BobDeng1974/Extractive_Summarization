it was @entity2 ’s strongest league campaign in years , a season when @entity4 and @entity5 served notice that they are on the move again			1
though the @entity10 trophy remained tantalisingly out of @entity4 ’s reach and @entity5 faltered when @entity13 football appeared in their grasp , the disappointments should not detract from the work the respective managers @entity17 and @entity18 have overseen			1
but this team has pace , energy , balance and attacking flair and the players included have all had years to remember			0
goalkeeper : @entity49 – back to his best under @entity18 and takes the place between the posts ahead of @entity52 after keeping 16 @entity10 clean sheets compared to the @entity4 man ’s 10			2
safe , reliable and vastly experienced and recently won a new contract			0
top stopper : @entity49 helped @entity5 qualify for the @entity58 next season right - back : @entity60 – @entity5 ’s @entity61 and a man whom @entity18 dubbed the best in his position in the league ; the fearless @entity66 international has flourished under @entity18 and scored seven goals in all competitions			2
coming of age : @entity60 was @entity5 's player of the season this year @entity72 : @entity73 – defending was the reason @entity4 ’s title charge fell down but @entity73 was the pick of @entity17 ’ back four and made 36 @entity10 appearances , scoring seven goals			1
he put through his net on four occasions but he was not a weak link by any means			0
hard man : @entity73 has been a rock at the heart of the @entity4 defence @entity72 : @entity88 – it was significant that two of @entity5 ’s poorest defensive displays , against @entity92 and @entity24 , came when @entity88 was nursing a hamstring problem			1
a calming influence and model professional , his abilities often go under - rated			0
calming influence : @entity88 was key at the back for @entity5 last season left - back : @entity19 – nobody would describe this as being a vintage campaign from the @entity105 international but , equally , nobody would preclude him from a composite team			1
always a threat at set - plays and his left - foot can be like a magic wand			0
a first class defender , too			0
always a threat : @entity19 and his dangerous left foot always gave @entity5 options holding midfield : @entity117 – the abiding image of his season should not be his slip against @entity121 ; it should be of him inspiring @entity4 , passing with elan and keeping cool under pressure to lead the title charge			1
' absolutely outstanding , ' was @entity17 assessment			0
it is hard to disagree			0
captain fantastic : @entity117 helped keep @entity4 in the title race until the final day of the season holding midfield : @entity130 – many @entity131 wondered what they were getting for £ 13.75million when he was brought into replace @entity133			1
what he soon showed was that @entity5 were significantly better with him in the engine room , a combination of class and graft			2
star signing : @entity130 has played a big part in @entity5 's sucess since signing from @entity144 right midfield : @entity146 – @entity4 desperately missed his energy , work rate and technique during the three games he was suspended on the run - in			1
he said back in july that this season had to be ' my time ' and his hard work has paid off with a trip to @entity157 looming			0
rejuvenated : @entity146 ( right ) silenced a few doubters after a superb season for @entity4 attacking midfield : @entity160 – it must be pointed out that the 20 - year - old has n’t been consistently brilliant			2
but when he shines , when gets the bit between his teeth and torments opponents , he is a joy to watch and capable of moments that get you out of your seat			0
for that reason , he gets accommodated and @entity171 drops to the bench			2
boy for @entity157 : @entity160 's performances this season have earned him a place in @entity105 's squad left midfield : @entity179 – started the season under a cloud , ended it in @entity184 ’s @entity183 squad			1
quick , tough , skilful and blessed with a big game temperament , @entity179 ’s performances were special			2
we will hear more and more of him in the coming years , as he shows the hype that accompanied his reputation in @entity193 football was not without substance			0
proving his worth : @entity179 is another young player who has earned his spot in @entity105 's squad @entity198 forward : @entity20 – the first name on the team sheet			1
for the goals and the individual awards , the man who had a nose for trouble has catapulted himself into the bracket of the modern greats			0
scored every type of goal in every type of game and it was impossible to accurately assess just how many points extra he was worth to @entity4			0
player of the season : @entity20 scored 31 goals for @entity4 this term @entity219 ( gk ) , @entity218 , @entity220 , @entity171 , @entity221 , @entity222 , @entity223 so there you have it			1
six starters from @entity5 may come as a surprise , given the respective finishing positions of the two clubs , but the key choice boiled down to whether to stick with @entity171 or opt for @entity160			1
missing out : @entity220 and @entity171 fail to make the starting xi of our team the @entity4 striker broke through the 20 - goal barrier – and equalled a club @entity10 record of scoring in 19 games , like @entity239 did in 1994/95 – @entity160 ’s ability to produce the unexpected demands his inclusion			1
that he is going to the @entity183 merely strengthens his claims .			0

@entity117 leads dream team *compiled* from @entity4 and @entity5
@entity105 stars @entity160 and @entity179 make best xi
@entity20 leads attack but no place for @entity220 or @entity171
