a defining phenomenon at this @entity1 for me has been the impact of special managers who have moulded their players into more than the sum of their parts			1
they all have a clear vision of how they want the game played , they get their teams playing like that			2
and then - the truly magical part - they do this while maintaining group harmony			0
the stand - out individuals in question have been , in no particular order , @entity22 of @entity23 , @entity24 of @entity25 , @entity26 of the @entity27 , @entity28 of @entity29 , @entity30 of @entity31 and @entity32 of @entity33 , who made that extraordinary substitution on saturday night , bring on @entity35 for penalties			1
@entity30 steered a stuttering team to the finals but has restored order from chaos by imposing his will			0
he did not succumb to public demand and play my former @entity52 team - mate @entity51 , aka @entity51 , despite him being a predator among predators			0
instead he had a belief in a system that worked well and refused to accommodate his star man			2
he had the respect and belief from all his squad , @entity51 included , and they reached the knockout stages			0
leaders : @entity24 and @entity22 were crucial to their team 's impressive @entity1 campaigns follow my lead : the @entity33 players seem to have total belief in their manager @entity22 is the @entity71 in charge of a @entity23 side who were unlucky to lose to @entity75 in the last 16			1
he got the job after winning three titles with one of @entity23 ’s biggest clubs , @entity80 , and his side played the high - tempo , pressing game last seen under @entity84			1
two other words sum up @entity22 ’s transformative powers : @entity87			1
it seemed he could n’t even pass the ball at times last season as @entity91 were relegated from the @entity92 , but he was intrinsic and superb at these finals			0
@entity24 , @entity25 ’s @entity71 coach , and @entity28 , the @entity95 in charge of @entity29 , have each taken groups of players with few star names and instilled in them the confidence to express themselves in styles that play to the strengths of the collective , rather than to any individual			1
@entity26 was always clear that his squad - from @entity106 and @entity107 , from @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 and other unheralded places in between - would never be less than competitive			0
collective : @entity24 led his team to the @entity1 quarter - finals as @entity115 ( left ) starred he was true to his word			1
he made a huge call even before getting to @entity75 by leaving @entity118 behind because he felt the team would benefit without a man who had earned 156 caps			1
and they gave it a really good shot , getting out of a group they had no right to escape — at least on paper			0
it was always likely @entity130 might struggle , as i wrote before the tournament			1
and there are all kinds of underlying issues to be addressed , as i outlined a fortnight ago			0
a visionary manager would help			2
in the mix : @entity27 boss @entity26 ( left ) ensured his team worked hard for each other @entity43 is a pleasant - enough man , extremely intelligent and has a cv with enough clubs and countries to show how widely he is respected			1
but if i ’m brutally honest then , for me , he lacks that extra ingredient to set him apart			1
he ’s certainly no maverick , he does n’t change matches with inspirational substitutions and i see little evidence of a collective buying into a master plan for @entity130 , if there even is one			1
it ’s not just @entity43 who has failed to shine as @entity130 boss , of course			1
@entity161 ’s boot camp approach was badly flawed , @entity159 was scarred by his failure , @entity158 hit quarter - final buffers , @entity156 himself admitted the job was too big for him			0
extra ingredient : @entity43 ( centre ) failed to make a positive impact with his substitutions in @entity75 so we ’re left with @entity169 , the last @entity130 manager who had something really different about him — that vision			1
certainly he was the best @entity130 manager in my personal experience			1
he did n’t have the best personality , and he was n’t the most diplomatic at times			0
but he knew what he was trying to achieve tactically , and had a vision of how his unit should work			0
i could imagine myself as part of bigger whole under him			0
before @entity169 , even though i was n’t an @entity130 player at the time , it ’s clear @entity182 also had a vision and the charisma to transmit that to his players			1
what ’s clear from some of the outstanding ‘ lesser ’ teams at this @entity1 is that the team takes precedence over individuals and personalities in a way it did n’t for @entity130			1
the big picture : @entity169 ( above ) has a clear vision of how a unit should work wing : @entity197 ( centre ) was played out of position and @entity130 seemed to pay the price @entity201 takes you only so far			1
it was a compromise to play @entity197 out of his favourite position			0
build your side around your best player or drop him			0
the other managers above did n’t fudge and that ’s what marks them out			0
@entity32 does n’t fudge either			2
i ’m sure you ’ve heard all the stories of how eccentric he can be but i ’ve not heard a bad word about him from any player he ’s worked with			0
he ’s a hard man , strong , big on discipline within the football environment			2
but he also trusts his players			2
the other night i was in a bar with some of his @entity33 squad			2
they were mixing with the public , having a bite to eat			0
they knew their curfew and would respect it			0
he believes in his players			2
having faith in the man in charge is a huge part of achieving success in our game			2
the best managers earn that faith			0
relaxed : @entity33 seem to have found the perfect balance between discipline and downtime in @entity75			2

@entity32 has made a huge impact with @entity33 during the @entity1
the @entity245 players seem to be fully behind every decision the manager makes
@entity25 boss @entity24 and @entity23 coach @entity22 can also be proud of their contributions
@entity169 could be the right man to take @entity130 forward
@entity43 lacks an extra ingredient to set him apart
