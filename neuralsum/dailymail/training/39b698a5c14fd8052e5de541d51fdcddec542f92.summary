but one daredevil climber took on the challenge with only his hands and feet to help him			2
@entity9 scaled the outside section of 1,083ft - high @entity11 today in the @entity13 area of @entity14 , @entity15			1
if he 'd taken the lift , he would have raced to the top in a mere minute			0
the tallest outdoor elevator in the world lets visitors dodge the 2 1/2 hour walk to the top			0
but @entity9 opted for the more dangerous route with its stunning , if terrifying , views of the dramatic green landscape and craggy rocks surrounding him			1
it took the @entity17 68 minutes and 26 seconds to complete his challenge the @entity11 , also known as the @entity45 , whisks tourists up the side of a massive sandstone column in a mountain range in @entity15 's @entity50			1
it 's not @entity9 's first daring - some may say reckless - climb at an international landmark			2
in 1989 he did scaled @entity56 's @entity55 without a safety harness , and climbed @entity59 's @entity58 while dressed as @entity60 .			0

@entity9 scaled the outside section of the @entity11
the 564ft challenge took 68 minutes and 26 seconds in @entity65 , @entity15
