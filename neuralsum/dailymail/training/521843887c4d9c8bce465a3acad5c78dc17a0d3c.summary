@entity0 honoured the memory of @entity2 by blasting an emotionally charged century - the best , he said , of his career - on day one of the rearranged first test against @entity4			1
a cloud hung over the @entity6 though when captain @entity7 was forced to leave the field with a back problem when he was 60 not out , and , like @entity2 on that fateful day , looking good for a century of his own			1
@entity0 ’s hundred was the perfect tribute to @entity2 on a day that started with 63 seconds of applause for the 25 - year - old , who died after being hit on the head by bouncer when he was 63 not out playing domestic cricket two weeks ago			1
@entity0 was fielding at gully on that day and rushed to @entity2 ’ aid when he fell and sat with his friend on the buggy that took him from a cricket field for the very last time			1
@entity24 and @entity4 paid tribute to @entity2 before the start of play in the first test of the series in @entity30 @entity0 was the star of the show as he scored 145 from 163 balls on the opening day at the @entity6 @entity0 took the attack to the @entity35 from the very beginning of the test match with his typically aggressive play @entity40 captain @entity7 was passed fit to play and was clearly emotional as the tribute to @entity2 took place @entity7 delivered a touching tribute to @entity2 at his funeral in @entity45 last week and he was still feeling the emotion a tribute to @entity2 is displayed on the big screen as both teams and fans take part in a 63 - second applause in @entity30 @entity0 , @entity53 , former @entity24 team confidant @entity54 and @entity7 take part in a 63 - second applause in tribute to @entity2 bowler @entity58 wipes his eye during the tributes to @entity2 before the start of play at the @entity6 around 20,000 spectators were in attendance for the first day 's play of the first test of the @entity40 summer on tuesday this was no ordinary opening day of a test match			1
the @entity6 stood as one , on a tuesday , to pay their respects to @entity2 before the start of play			1
players , management and match officials lined up in front of a large white 408 – @entity79 number - painted onto the pristine outfield while a video tribute was played out on the big screen			0
players wore black armbands , sported 408 on the chests of their playing shirts , and stood shoulder to shoulder to honour their mate			0
if @entity0 had been moved by the tribute , he dealt with the emotion through his bat			0
boundary after boundary was unleashed in an exhilarating first hour , as he punishing @entity97 in particular			0
with every one of @entity0 ’s fours , there was a sense of relief and release from the crowd as they applauded fervently			0
their energy surely translated to the opener , whose innings was punctuated with poignant milestones			0
first there was the half century , reached off just 45 balls			0
when his ninth four whistled to the boundary he raised his bat gently , closed his eyes and tilted his head back to the heavens			0
then , on 61 , he swept to deep square leg , ran two , and as he reached 63 not out , the crowd rose once again in spontaneous applause			0
@entity0 threw his head up to the skies for a second time , raised his bat and momentarily sank to his haunches			2
the no 408 is painted on the outfield at the @entity6 , the number of @entity2 ' test cap the @entity40 team wore black armbands with the initials ' ph ' on and also the @entity125 under the crest on their shirt @entity2 was named as 13th man by the @entity40 team for the test against @entity4 in @entity30 cards with a tribute to @entity2 and his score of 63 not out , the score he was on when he was hit by a fatal bouncer spectators join in the 63 - second applause for @entity2 before the start of play at the @entity6 spectators filter into the @entity6 ahead of the first day 's play in the first test of @entity24 's series against @entity4 tributes to @entity2 are left at a memorial at the @entity6 , the home of @entity2 ' state team @entity24 @entity2 was playing for @entity24 when he was hit in the head by a bouncer at the @entity156 @entity40 players line up their bats in honour of @entity2 at the @entity6 before the first test against @entity4 a spectator writes a tribute to @entity2 , who died aged 25 after being hit on the head by a bouncer in a freak accident he was already removing his helmet as he jogged the single that took him to three figures midway through the afternoon session			1
he kissed the badge on his helmet with feeling , raised his bat and helmet to the skies , looked long towards the heavens , and after two weeks of tension and grief he finally leapt into the air and was engulfed in a bear hug by his batting partner @entity7			0
as @entity0 buried his head in his captain ’s chest , you could have been forgiven for thinking the left - hander 's shoulders shook just a little			2
it was his 10th test century but the most meaningful and highly charged of them all			0
he eventually departed to yet another ovation when he tried to hoik @entity4 ’s debutant leg spinner @entity191 into the @entity192 stand and was caught at deep midwicket			0
@entity7 had received a stirring reception when he came out to bat after @entity196 was caught at second slip for 14 – the second wicket of the day after @entity199 edged an attempted cover drive to the cordon			1
before @entity196 had left the outfield the members were already on their feet , turning their backs to the field of play and looking up towards the dressing room , waiting for the @entity24 captain to come jogging down the steps			1
@entity40 captain @entity7 was passed fit to play and elected to bat first after winning the toss @entity0 ducks to avoid a bouncer from @entity97 , the first short ball of the test match , in the fourth over @entity199 was caught at second slip by @entity219 off the bowling of @entity221 for nine @entity4 celebrate their first wicket after being hammered by @entity0 for the first half hour of play at the @entity6 @entity191 then welcomed @entity196 to the crease by bowling him a bouncer with his very first delivery @entity7 cut a desperately sad figure though , limping back to the dressing room 60 runs later , with his back crocked again , having put a on century stand with @entity0			1
he grimaced after withdrawing from a pull shot , and tried to stretch his back on the outfield , receiving treatment on the ground , before eventually leaving to be further assessed			0
until that point he had been batting fluently and moving freely			0
he was just three runs short of 63			0
questions will linger as to whether @entity7 was genuinely fit enough to play this match , or whether the personal enormity of the occasion encouraged him to take a risk			2
regardless of the hamstring , which has troubled him in the build up , his back has been an ongoing issue and there must be some doubt as to the role he will be able to play through the rest of the @entity40 summer			2
the first bouncer of the match came 20 minutes into the day 's play			2
it was bowled by @entity97 and was roundly applauded by the crowd as @entity0 ducked safely beneath it			1
the next delivery was short , too , but played less safely as @entity0 upper cut it without control over cover point			2
there was no shortage of short stuff ; @entity7 got a bouncer first ball and stared down @entity97 after he delivered it ; @entity196 looked less comfortable against @entity221 , swaying away and almost toppling over			1
@entity0 looks and points to the sky after going to a brisk 50 on the first morning in @entity30 @entity0 was in no mood to hang around as he reached his 50 in just 45 deliveries with eight boundaries @entity196 edged to second slip as he was dismissed for 14 ( left ) and captain @entity7 was greeted by a bouncer with his first ball ( right ) @entity97 and @entity7 exchange some words and a stare after the @entity35 bowler greeted him with a bouncer @entity0 looks to the sky and raises his bat after reaching 63 not out - the score which @entity2 was on when he was hit by a bouncer @entity0 and @entity7 head off for lunch on day one in @entity30 , at which stage @entity24 were on 113 for two @entity4 generally started off bowling too short though , and @entity97 could learn a lot from @entity191 ’s control			1
a flurry of late wickets came when the new ball was pitched up after tea			0
four scalps in the evening session , including that of @entity0 , made @entity4 feel better about their day ’s performance			2
as a further tribute to @entity2 the @entity40 team lined their bats up against an advertising hording next to the gate on the boundary			1
on each bat handle hung a @entity79 cap			0
@entity305 , meanwhile , returned to cricket for the first time since bowling the bouncer that fatally injured @entity2			2
he sent down a short ball with his fifth delivery playing for @entity311 back at the @entity156 ; a small detail in a match report - he also took two wickets on day one against @entity315 - but a huge step in his mental recovery			1
@entity0 and @entity7 took control of the afternoon session as they put on a century stand for the third wicket @entity0 celebrates after reaching his century at the @entity6 by pointing to the sky and jumping for joy @entity7 raised his bat and looked to the heavens after reaching a half - century on his return to the team @entity40 captain @entity7 was forced off injured after twisting to avoid a short ball @entity7 is attended to by the @entity40 team doctor @entity332 after feeling a problem with his back the @entity40 captain , who had been struggling with injury problems in the lead up to the series , was left with no choice but to retire hurt @entity0 eventually had to depart after being caught in the deep , but he left to a standing ovation from the @entity6 crowd @entity343 continued @entity24 's free scoring in the evening session when he came in to bat @entity343 celebrated reaching 50 and 63 not out by raising his bat and looking to the heavens in tribute to @entity2			1
