while plain , wooden , gender - neutral dollhouses have been available through boutique toy makers for some years , it seems that mass market retailers are finally catching on			1
@entity4 , a professor of sociology at @entity6 , looked into the girl - orientated toy in lieu of the holiday season , and found a surprising number of @entity12 dollhouses veered away from heteronormative stereotypes , and instead ' had themes of friendship and , dare i say , female - independence			1
' writing for @entity19 , she said : ' these houses had only women or , more often , a group of women and one man			0
they gave the impression of female home - ownership and female dominated social interaction			0
' gender roles : furnished dollhouses , like this one by @entity31 , $ 184.99 , started a movement toward mass market gender - neutral dollhouses dollhouses today are considered ' girly ' and therefore a ' gender issue ' because toy marketers have long sent pink - filled messages that they are a girls - only role playing device			1
however , as many parents know , both boys and girls play with dollhouses and acquire different lessons from the experience			0
while a girl may put a mother in the kitchen , and a boy may mow the imaginary lawn , or vice versa , children often role - play what they see their parents doing , and other families in their community doing			0
the need to role - play will be expressed whether it is through a dollhouse , playing dress - up , a kitchen play set , or stuffed animals ; and big toy companies like @entity12 and @entity67 are beginning to realise that this includes both genders - not just girls whose favourite colour is pink			1
not just for girls : @entity73 , recently available at @entity67 , is a step forward in accepting that boys are also interested in role - playing with a dollhouse female domination : @entity78 , available at @entity12 , $ 129.99 , features a group of women and one man - giving the impression of female home - ownership and female dominated social interaction @entity67 recently released a fireman - themed dollhouse , which while not gender - neutral , is a step forward in accepting that boys are also interested in role - playing with a dolls house			1
it also sells large , durable , unpainted wooden dolls houses ' so multiple children can play at the same time , ' and create their own world within it			0

( all humans were white - some dollhouses included non-human creatures - and just about everyone appears to be wealthy			2
) ' she added : ' interestingly , most of the dollhouses that ... gave the impression of female home - ownership and female dominated social interaction , were @entity78 affiliated			2
new world : @entity116 , available at @entity67 , $ 139.99 , allows multiple children to create their own world within it ' people disagree as to whether @entity78 is a good role model for young women			0
she is roundly criticized for upholding a harmful standard of beauty , but she also tells women they can run for president and go to the moon			0
' in this case , @entity78 is sending girls the message that they can have fulfilling lives and own homes without a husband			0
' however some parents actually see gender - specific dollhouses that perpetuate stereotypical gender roles as irrelevant			1
one commenter wrote : ' if you want your kids to have alternative models of gender roles , you achieve that by modeling them as their parents , not giving them gender - neutral models to play with .			1
