the prime minister has accused @entity1 of ‘ wriggling like an eel ’ when pressed on whether he intended to use the @entity3 as a political weapon			1
in november , the @entity6 ’s political editor @entity5 revealed : ‘ a phrase the @entity9 leader uses in private is that he wants to – and i quote – weaponise the @entity3 for politics			1
’ yesterday it emerged that mr @entity1 made the comment almost two months ago , in a private meeting attended by up to 15 senior executives at @entity16			1
his remark was brought up in the @entity18 last week by @entity19 , who said he thought that it was a ‘ disgusting ’ thing to say			1
he failed to disown the phrase , saying : ‘ i want to fight for the @entity3			2
i do n’t recall exactly what i said , but we are in a fight for the @entity3 , and i make absolutely no apologies for the fact that i ’m really concerned about what ’s happening to our @entity3			2
’ yesterday the @entity9 leader again avoided the issue at an event with voters , with his spokesman saying he would not comment on the contents of a private meeting			1
appearing at the event with voters in @entity43 , @entity44 , he chose not take any questions from the press			0
asked about mr @entity1 ’s comments as he unveiled his election priorities in @entity49 yesterday , @entity19 said : ‘ frankly i think it was an appalling thing to say			1
' the @entity3 is not a weapon , it is what we have for looking after our families , for caring for the elderly , the ill and the frail			0
it is the most vital public service in our country			0
’ he added : ‘ watching that exchange , where he was wriggling like an eel , made it absolutely clear to me that he did say those words and that is why he would n’t deny it , and i think in one moment we learned more about @entity9 ’s attitude to the @entity3 than we ’ve learned for five years , they see it as a political weapon			1
i think it ’s disgraceful			0
’ labour leader @entity1 clashed with @entity19 last week over the @entity3 crisis after the @entity74 raised comments he had made to the @entity6 political editor @entity5 ( right ) last night mr @entity1 told @entity77 : ‘ this is a smokescreen from the @entity79			1
it ’s not about the words people use , it ’s about the commitments they make			0
’ and a @entity9 source said : ‘ we ’ve been really clear , this is a fight about the future of the @entity3 , and we ’re going to make sure we make it that fight			2
' we are not going to talk about what were the words used in a private conversation			0
what we wo n’t do is leave in any doubt that we intend to make this a fight about the @entity3			0
’ but @entity3 campaigner @entity97 , whose mother died following blunders at @entity100 , told the @entity101 : ‘ what a disgraceful comment from @entity1 , planning to weaponise the @entity3			2
‘ putting politics before patients was a mistake they made when they were last in government , and why they should not be trusted with the @entity3 again			0

@entity19 accused @entity9 leader of using ‘ disgusting ’ term in private
@entity1 was *repeatedly* asked on tv if he had indeed used the word
he would say only that he could not recall whether he had done or not
the *pm* said it was now ' absolutely clear ' mr @entity1 had used the term
