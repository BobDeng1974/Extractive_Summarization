@entity0 would be a perfect match for @entity2			1
it should be no surprise they tried to lure him to a poser ’s paradise where security is as high as the tax is low , and where the yachts are as big as the dogs are small			0
you can picture the hair gel glistening in the sun as his @entity16 glides by @entity18			0
it is not so easy to envisage him performing to sparse crowds at the @entity22 , but maybe one day it will appeal			0
‘ it ’s true we met @entity0 , ’ nodded @entity24 , @entity2 ’s vice- president and right - hand man to billionaire owner and president , @entity28			1
‘ i know @entity0 , but it was not quite on			2
@entity2 's days of signing @entity33 talent like @entity34 ( left ) and @entity35 ( centre ) are over @entity2 have downgraded their transfer policy from signing @entity34 to the likes of @entity40 ( right ) @entity35 left the principality to sign for @entity42 for around £ 60m in the summer @entity2 's vice president @entity24 concedes a @entity45 @entity44 bill and @entity47 regulations have cut spending ‘ we were joking one day he might come			1
he likes @entity2 , the project , and our president , they know each other			1
we sat down with @entity0 but knowing we were looking a bit more in the distant future			2
we did not enter into serious discussions with @entity57 , but we had contact about signing him			1
we were almost at the point of meeting @entity61 but he did not want to come			2
’ these targets were set in the heady days after the @entity28 takeover saved as @entity2 from relegation to the @entity45 third tier and the threat of extinction in december 2011 , and then restored them to @entity69 within 18 months			1
since then , strategy has changed			0
a-list players are no longer such prime targets			2
stars like @entity34 and @entity35 have left , but the ambition remains to keep this club at the top			1
the @entity69 club held talks with @entity42 star @entity0 during the height of their financial power @entity57 ( left ) and @entity61 were also courted by the formerly big spending @entity45 side ‘ @entity2 is an attractive place , ’ said @entity24			1
‘ families and wives of players fall in love with it			0
for some , it ’s important to have a stadium full of 60,000 fans			0
for others , it is to have the feeling and security this country can offer			0
with equal terms , some players will say no , no , not @entity2 , and others will say yes , yes , every time			1
this was the case with @entity34			2
’ when @entity34 moved on loan to @entity103 , soon after @entity35 had been sold to @entity42 , fans protested and rumours were rife @entity28 was bored , feeling the pinch of his divorce or had fallen out with @entity107 , after failing to acquire @entity109 citizenship			1
these were refuted by the owners , who put the policy shift down to @entity112 ’s @entity47 rules and a £ 41.5million bill from the @entity45 @entity44 to offset the club ’s tax - free status			1
‘ to jump - start the project , massive investments were needed , ’ said @entity24			2
‘ our president is a very ambitious man and we accomplished what we did			0
but since the summer 2013 , i said : “ look , there wo n’t be massive investments			0
” ’ little known @entity123 celebrates after scoring the winner in @entity2 's 1 - 0 defeat of @entity126 at the weekend @entity2 's rise from the @entity45 third division to the @entity129 has been bankrolled by billionaire owner @entity130 , pictured here with @entity107 ( right ) the principality 's lavish lifestyle , low taxes and high security are a lure for professional footballers @entity47 rules squeezed this club , with its tiny fan base inside a nation with a population of 35,000			1
‘ nobody wants an unfair competition , ’ said @entity24			2
‘ the trick is how to implement this in real life			0
is the recent ( £ 5billion ) tv rights deal in @entity149 unfair to other @entity151 clubs ? can they compete at the same level when @entity155 clubs can buy almost any player ? ‘ under these rules , a project like @entity158 or @entity159 is no longer possible			0
is it good big clubs stay big and small ones stay small ? ’ one arm of @entity2 ’s new strategy is to revert to the strengths of the era when @entity168 was in charge , producing talent like @entity171 , @entity172 and @entity173			2
@entity175 ’s squad is the youngest left in the @entity129 , even with @entity177 ( 36 ) and @entity40 ( 34 ) boosting the average age to 23.9 years			2
@entity173 is one of several @entity45 legends to have been groomed at @entity2 @entity2 coach @entity175 has the youngest squad left in the @entity129 ‘ when we signed @entity183 ( @entity177 ) there was so much criticism because of his age , ’ said @entity24			1
‘ but when i met him for the first time , at night in @entity42 , in his jeep so no one would see us , i recognised his positive personality and it has helped us a lot			0
’ another arm of the plan is to lean on @entity2 ’s global appeal and association with its @entity197 and @entity196			0
the club crest has been redesigned to include the word @entity2 rather than the initials @entity200 and this season ’s team photo was taken at the opulent @entity204			1
‘ @entity2 is a historic club — one of the major clubs in @entity45 — and the ambition was always to give back this identity , ’ said @entity24			1
we consider ourselves part of the principality , which stands in this world for many things : luxury , sports , ecology			0
’ @entity168 will return to his former club when @entity218 face @entity2 in the @entity129 last 16 the @entity219 prepared for wednesday 's clash with a 2 - 1 victory over @entity222 at the weekend they are into the knock - out stages of the @entity129 for the first time in a decade and the draw against @entity168 ’s @entity218 laces the revival story with emotion			1
‘ @entity168 is revered as one of the great coaches in @entity2 history and one of the iconic coaches in modern football , ’ said @entity24 , but he quashed the idea the 65 - year - old may return to the club he led to the @entity45 title in 1988			1
‘ we have to accept @entity218 is a different level in @entity151 football			0
he has been there for nearly 20 years and done an amazing job			0
we have the greatest respect but to come back to @entity2 is not on the agenda			0
we are going for coaches who still have to grow and prove themselves and develop as part of the project			0
’ may 2011 @entity2 are relegated to @entity250 for the first time since 1976 after finishing 18th			0
december 2011 @entity28 acquires a controlling stake with the club bottom of @entity250			2
@entity254 after finishing eighth , the club appoint former @entity158 boss @entity257 as manager			0
may 2013 @entity2 are crowned champions in convincing style , securing promotion back to @entity69			1
july 2013 the club embark on a £ 140m spending spree , signing @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity264			1
may 2014 — present they finish second , but @entity257 is sacked and replaced by @entity175			0
a £ 41.5m tax bill and @entity28 ’s £ 2.6bn divorce pay - out play their part as @entity34 and @entity35 are sold , ending their brief time as big spenders .			1

@entity2 have been bankrolled from the @entity45 third division into the @entity129 by billionaire owner @entity28
@entity0 , @entity57 and @entity61 have all been targets
