by @entity0 fairytale home seeks princess			2
that could be the estate agent ’s pitch for a garden flat decorated in pink that has gone on sale near @entity8 in southwest @entity9			2
the two - bedroom home in @entity11 has been furnished and decorated as if it was being lived in by @entity12 and is one sale for £ 1.7million			2
it has pink walls and ceiling throughout and the bigger bedroom has a light pink four poster bed with matching coloured curtains			0
where a princess like @entity12 could lay her head until @entity23 comes along to wake her up with a kiss the patio has pink garden furniture and a splash of different colour is added by the plants and trees			0
the flat is ten times the price of the average home sold in @entity34 and @entity35 but is relatively cheap for the swanky area because it only has 36 years remaining on its lease			1
the asking price works out at £ 47,000 per year or a little under £ 4,000 per month - which is around the going rate to rent a two - bedroom flat in the area			1
the living room of the flat in @entity44 's @entity43 , on sale for a bargain £ 1.7million - as long as you do n't mind a lease that runs out in 36 years and a service charge of £ 19,000 a year before your rush out with your chequebooks or debit cards , there is also £ 5,000 to pay for ground rent and a service charge of £ 19,000 a year say estate agents @entity57 and @entity59			1
it has an entrance hall , drawing room and dining room which is linked via a patio to the kitchen			0
a further patio links the drawing room with the master bedroom suite while the guest bedroom is on a raised ground floor with a further guest bathroom and lavatory			0
the pink theme continues in the patio with pink furniture , pink walls and even a few pink blooms among the greenery the garden flat in @entity11 , @entity79 is awash with pinkery from walls to furniture			0
it can be yours for £ 1.7million plus a few thousand more a year on ground rent and service charge @entity86 in @entity44 : a pink garden flat is on sale here for £ 1.7million , suitable for a princess according to the estate agent @entity11 ( centre ) is a just a six - minute walk to @entity8 ( top of the map ) and is near to all sorts of other shopping pardises such as @entity98 ( 8 minutes ) and @entity99 ( 10 minutes ) and close to @entity100			1

flat near @entity8 is ten times more *expensive* than average home in @entity34 and @entity35
the ground rent is £ 5,000 a year plus there is a service charge of £ 19,000 per annum
the flat is *leasehold* and there are only 36 years left on the lease , hence the ' cheaper ' asking price
