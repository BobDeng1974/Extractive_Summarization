by @entity0 last updated at 4:54 pm on 26th december 2011 artifacts from the heady days of the @entity2 have been unearthed by workers digging @entity5 's multi-billion dollar transport terminal			1
they include clay opium pipes from a @entity9 laundry , @entity11 perfume bottles , a chipped porcelain chamber pot found in an outhouse and animal bone toothbrushes			1
city archaeologists and residents are excited by the 70 artifacts discovered beneath their feet during the excavation of the $ 3.9 billion ( £ 2.5bn ) @entity20			1
fragile : a pair of porcelain dolls on show in @entity5 which were discovered when the old transport terminal was demolished treasure : archeologist @entity26 examines a barrel strap and rope pulley shown at the exhibition the old demolished terminal stood on the same site once inhabited by working - class @entity33 immigrants and @entity9 labourers who lived back to back on the sand dunes of the busy @entity2 port known as @entity37			1
they were the @entity39 and the @entity40 , the @entity41 and the @entity42 , and the now - seemingly quaint accoutrements of their lives are being unearthed			1
there are clay opium pipes and ceramic teapots from @entity9 ; @entity11 perfume bottles ; dainty @entity48 serving dishes , apothecary jars and the heads of hand - painted porcelain dolls and abandoned chamber pots			1
they all date back to the mid-to - late 1880s , when the cove was reclaimed and clapboard houses went up on @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 streets , between @entity62 and @entity63			1
tools : a rusty rope pulley , crucibles and a chisel are shown at the exhibit of artifacts which were dug up during excavations they were filled with @entity33 , @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 immigrants , as well as the @entity9 who had come during the @entity2 and then stayed on to help build the railways and bridges			2
the million - square - foot sleek and modern bus and railway station being built in the @entity82 financial district is billed as the ' @entity83 of the @entity84 '			2
it will serve as the northern end of @entity88 's planned high - speed rail line between @entity5 and @entity89			2
today 's residents and workers can see the exhibit in the lobby of the building that houses the @entity95			2
the artifacts are accompanied by historic photos and documents			2
unearthed : medicine bottles and a chipped porcelain chamber pot found in a privy were among the artifacts on display : animal bone toothbrushes were among 70 artifacts unearthed by workers fortune seekers prospectors are depicted in a wood engraving washing for gold during the @entity2 of 1849 an 1885 article from the @entity111 reveals @entity33 landlords @entity113 and @entity114 were seeking 500 dollars in damages from @entity116 and 11 @entity9 tenants for the ' offensive smells from the laundry that injured the rental value of the plaintiff 's premises '			1
the @entity2 began at @entity123 , near @entity124 on january 24 , 1848			2
@entity125 found shiny metal in the tailrace - a man - made channel carrying water - of a lumber mill he was building for pioneer @entity132 on the @entity134			2
after tests showed that it was gold , @entity135 wanted to keep the news quiet because he feared his plans for an agricultural empire would be ruined			0
but rumours soon spread and were confirmed in march 1848 by @entity5 newspaper publisher and merchant @entity143			0
after he had set up a store to sell prospecting supplies , he strode through the streets holding aloft a vial of gold , shouting , ' @entity2 ! gold ! gold from the @entity134 ! ' soon , waves of immigrants from around the world , later called the ' forty - @entity155 ' , poured in			0
as @entity135 had feared , he was ruined - his workers left and squatters took over his land and stole his crops and cattle			0
@entity162 , a @entity9 engineer with a firm that hopes to work on bus storage for the new terminal , visited the exhibition			0
' it 's very interesting to see the pottery compared to the metal things that are all rusted and ruined , ' he said , looking at a pristine blue - and - white @entity9 teapot			0
' the pottery looks almost @entity173 's the @entity9 character for longevity			0
' @entity176 , an archaeologist with @entity177 , the firm ensuring the items are unearthed and preserved , said : ' it 's not often that you get a chance to have a window into what used to be			1
' mr @entity176 said the artifacts were not necessarily unique and that they expected to unearth hundreds more			0
' what is unusual is that we were able to identify the people and occupations of the early @entity2 , ' he said			0
' when the @entity2 started in the 1850s , the miners came here and there was no place for them to live , so they lived in the sand dunes and then tent camps			0
' we found the evidence : a wooden floor and a lot of bottles , barrels , a privy , leather shoes and boots			1
' they would have worked in the @entity204 - which built pipes for @entity207 plantations - the @entity208 , @entity209 or the @entity210 mr @entity176 said his favourite find was an oblong , earthen storage jar found fully intact			1
the unglazed pot with a thin neck and bulbous belly was used to store grain , olives or water			0
' it 's the equivalent of today 's plastic water bottle in that they were used , and used , and then thrown away , ' he said			0
he also liked a porcelain chamber pot found at the bottom of an outhouse			1
it might have been part of a toiletry set sold by @entity228 back then for 2.25 dollars ( £ 1.44 ) .			0
