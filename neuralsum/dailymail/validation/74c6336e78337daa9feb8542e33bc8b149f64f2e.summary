@entity8 pediatrician @entity7 , 51 , was convicted of killing @entity9 in september 2011 amid a bitter custody dispute			1
he faces up to life in prison			1
the case was highly contentious , with prosecutors alleging @entity7 had murdered his wife while defense attorneys claimed @entity17 killed herself			1
their son , @entity18 , said that though his father told him and his three siblings that their mother had killed herself , he did n't believe it			1
' as i thought about ... my dad 's behavior before and after her death , it became more and more apparent to me that - that he was responsible for killing her , ' @entity18 told @entity37 's @entity36			1
prosecutors alleged @entity7 attacked 49 - year - old @entity9 with a knife , dosed her with an anti-anxiety drug @entity41 and drowned her in her bathtub			1
defense attorneys countered that the theory was unbelievable , and it was more likely @entity17 killed herself			1
her death initially was treated as a suicide			1
but family and friends pushed for more investigation , saying the researcher showed no signs of wanting to end her life			1
@entity18 told @entity37 that he feared for his and his sibling 's lives , worrying that they might be living with a murder			2
' part of the reason i was concerned for my safety as well as my sibling 's safety - was that i saw this anger that he had towards my mother , ' @entity18 said			1

it jumped and it expanded			0

on the day before his 18th birthday in january 2012 , @entity18 moved out of his father 's house into the home of his best friend , @entity93 , and was welcomed by her parents with open arms			1

' i realized that my presence there was not protecting my siblings , ' he told @entity37 , adding that his father was upset that he had moved out			0

@entity18 countered his father 's lawsuit with a wrongful death suit , holding his father responsible in the death of his mother			1
@entity7 was eventually arrested and put on trial for the murder of @entity17			1
the evidence in the case was unusual : a medical examiner thought the shallow cuts on @entity17 's wrists and leg looked like she was defending herself from an attack , but he could n't explain the fatal level of @entity41 in her system			1
forensic experts had very different interpretations of the scene			0
@entity18 ( left ) spent his entire inheritance from his mother ( right ) campaigning for his father 's conviction			1

prosecutor @entity261 said @entity18 played an important part in the case , one of many pieces that formed the largely circumstantial case			0
as the verdict was read , @entity23 sat with his hands folded and shoulders bent , staring down and blinking rapidly as his frown deepened			0

' this verdict will not bring @entity9 back , ' she said in a statement			0
' now , to that tragedy has been added the conviction of an innocent man			0
