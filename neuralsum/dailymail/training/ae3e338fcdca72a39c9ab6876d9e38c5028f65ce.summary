@entity1 police have uncovered a city centre cannabis farm after spotting a remarkable lack of snow on the roof of one home , while neighbouring buildings suffered a heavy covering			1
officers in the city of @entity11 , 12 miles west of @entity12 , raided the otherwise unremarkable home after spotting it had a snow - free roof despite heavy snowfall only hours earlier			1
the lack of snow suggested the temperature inside the building was so high that the snow was melting more rapidly than on neighbours ' homes - a tip - off from @entity23 that @entity1 police are turning to with increasing frequency in order to catch cannabis cultivators in the winter months			2
while in summer months the effects are not unnoticeable to anybody standing outside the building , the effects of keeping the plant at a steady @entity43 can lead to unwanted consequences			0
with snow almost guaranteed in the @entity1 ' mid-winter , police are increasingly looking out for houses with a tell - tale frost free roof to locate the otherwise unremarkable residential houses drug lords favour when creating cannabis farms			1
in fact the technique has become so common that @entity1 police last week released details of several cannabis farms they discovered using the technique - including a photograph of the building in @entity11			1
last monday officers used the same premise to raid a farm in the city of @entity66 , where they found a total of 88 cannabis plants			2
two days later one person was arrested in @entity71 in similar circumstances			0
not everybody is happy with the technique , however			0
after @entity11 police revealed the unorthodox method , @entity76 users asked whether innocent families with a sauna in a loft conversion could also expect to be raided as potential drug lords , as their homes suffer similar snow - free roofs			1
after police in @entity11 ( pictured ) revealed their unorthodox method of identifying cannabis farms , @entity76 users asked whether innocent families with a sauna in a loft conversion could also expect to be raided the arrests may come as something as a surprise to those who thought growth of cannabis was legal in the @entity1 , which has long had a relatively relaxed attitude towards the drug			1
however the law states that no more than five cannabis plants can be grown in any one , as that is believed to be the cultivation limit for personal use			0
any more than five plants and the grower is considered to be a preparing the drugs for sale , which is illegal			0
possession of cannabis is restricted to no more than five grams in a public place			0
the @entity1 police technique of visually checking rooftops for snow is something of a low - maintenance adaption of the way @entity117 police use helicopters equipped with heat - seeking technology to identify buildings giving off abnormally high levels of heat			2
speaking in 2013 , @entity123 , @entity124 deputy air operations manager , said : ' our thermal cameras can detect unusually high temperatures coming from properties several thousand feet away â€“ anyone growing cannabis on a commercial scale , using rows of heat lamps , runs the very real risk their criminality will be rumbled from the skies			0

@entity138 in @entity11 , @entity1 had snow free roof despite heavy snowfall
police officers were *suspicious* as to why the snow had melted so quickly
they raided house and discovered it was being used as a cannabis farm
@entity1 police are increasingly looking at snow - free roofs as possible evidence of a building being *secretly* used as a marijuana factory
locals are *unhappy* however , raising *concerns* that innocent families with a sauna in their loft conversion may also find themselves raided
