these lakes may look like they are full of bizarre floating sea cratures , but they are actually filled with thousands of frozen bubbles			1
snapped across @entity3 in @entity4 , @entity5 , the natural wonders are made of highly flammable gas methane			1
the gas - emitted by bacteria after they consume dead organic matter - is fairly harmless , but these bubbles can cause an explosion if lit. scroll down for a video showing bubbles being ignited a photographer has captured amazing images of methane bubbles in @entity3 in @entity4 , @entity5			1
pictured are some methane gas bubbles underneath @entity19 @entity20 , 35 , tracked down the natural phenomenon , which he photographed at @entity22 , the @entity19 and @entity23			1
@entity23 is the most commonly - photographed spot for the spectacular sight			0
but adventure - loving mr @entity20 , who loves to explore , revealed @entity22 offers rival views - but is just a little trickier to get to			0
he said : ' all three lakes are ever - changing , cover wide areas and provide endless possibilities for the keen landscape photographer			2
' they are magical places to explore and i find myself returning to them often			0
' the methane bubbles depicted in the photographs have generated a lot of buzz primarily on social media			2
' many people have never seen the phenomenon before			0
' people marvelled at the beauty of them and wondered what they really were			0
' the pictures show a frozen lake with the icy ' circles ' trapped underneath in fascinating formations the frozen bubbles form when microbes consume dead organic matter on the bottom of the lake			1
in the summer the bubbles simply rise to the surface and pop , but in the winter they are frozen within the ice			1
bubbles are seen around a larger chunk of frozen snow on the right @entity20 , 35 , tracked down the natural phenomenon , which he photographed at @entity22 , the @entity19 and @entity23			2

but adventure - loving mr @entity20 , who loves to explore , revealed @entity22 , pictured , offers rival views - yet is just a little trickier to get to ' they are magical places to explore and i find myself returning to them often , ' said mr @entity20 unusual pancake shaped ice formations that are more typically seen in @entity72 and @entity74 sea ice were found floating on a river in @entity76 back in december			2
the dinner plate - sized ice ' pancakes ' have formed on a quiet stretch of the @entity81 in @entity82			2
the strange formations were photographed at the @entity84 , @entity85 , near @entity86 , by @entity87 , a biologist for the @entity88			0
the pancakes are thought to have formed from foam created by faster flowing water further upstream , accumulating in a corner of a pool			0
freezing temperatures last week caused the foam to freeze , and the current bashed them into a circular shape			0
normally pancakes form on ocean water or lakes around the @entity101 where the movement of water keeps the ice from forming a flat sheet			2
however , they do ooccasionally occur on rivers when temperatures drop low enough			0
officials at the @entity110 said it is the first time they have seen pancake ice form on the river			0
the strange phenomena is caused when permafrost in the area begins to thaw out			0
organic matter stored in the bottom of the lake begins to thaw out , and microbes decompose it , releasing methane			1
methane does not dissolve into the water , and instead forms bubbles that rise to the surface			2
in summer , the methane bubbles simply rise to the surface and pop to enter the atmosphere			1
however , when the lake is frozen in the winter , the bubbles become trapped on their way to the surface			1
in a video , professor @entity135 from the @entity136 likened it to a ‘ time - lapse photograph ’ of methane emissions from the lakes			0
it should be noted , however , that the methane bubbles can be dangerous - a molecule of methane is 25 times more potent as a heat - trapping gas than carbon dioxide			1
if you were to ‘ pop ’ one of the bubbles and hold a match over it , it would ignite			0

methane does not dissolve into the water , and instead forms bubbles the bubbles get trapped on their way to the surface and the ice thickens and freezes around them , which can create the ‘ layered ’ bubble effect seen in these images			1
in a video , professor @entity135 from the @entity136 likened it to a ‘ time - lapse photograph ’ of methane emissions from the lakes it should be noted , however , that the bubbles can be slightly dangerous - a molecule of methane is 25 times more potent as a heat - trapping gas than carbon dioxide			1
