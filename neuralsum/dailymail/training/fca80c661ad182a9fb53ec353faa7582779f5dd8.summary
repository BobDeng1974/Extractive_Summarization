think you know what everyone else says about your state ? maybe you should ask @entity4			0
one enterprising blogger has and got some surprising and - some might say - less surprising results			0
as part of her research into stereotypes , @entity7 hit on a clever idea to find out what people think about different @entity15 states			1
boring : for 18 @entity15 states ( shaded purple ) autocomplete included ' boring ' among the top searched words she began typing the names into @entity4 and used the search engine 's autocomplete function to complete the query			1
so , for example , she asked ' why is @entity26 so ' and @entity4 's algorithm , which tries to predict the next word based on popular searches , did the rest			1
the result showed what people ask most about a state			1
in @entity36 's case they want to know why it 's so ' boring ' , and the same with @entity38			2
@entity26 is ' hot ' , ' racist ' , and also ' boring '			1
@entity39 is ' liberal ' , ' weird ' , ' rainy ' , and again , ' boring '			2
@entity40 is also ' boring ' , but ' important in the primaries '			2
why is ... so obese ? states with ' obese ' among popular searched terms include @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 , where obesity is most prevalent when @entity48 used the formula of ' why is @entity50 so ... ? ' the terms that popped up included ' hot ' , ' racist ' , ' conservative ' and ' crazy '			1
@entity46 also did n't come out well , the top suggested search terms included ' poor ' , ' racist ' , ' fat ' and ' weird '			1
when a user types a word into the @entity4 search box , the autocomplete algorithm offers search terms based on what is entered			2
for example , if someone starts to type ' new york ' , autocomplete will offer searches for ' @entity65 , ' ' @entity66 , ' and ' @entity67 ' based on the first word			0
queries are algorithmically determined based on a number of purely algorithmic factors ( including popularity of search terms ) without human intervention			2
source : @entity75 according to recently released @entity77 research , @entity46 was ranked the least livable state based on low unemployment , appalling obesity rates and lack of economic growth			0
for 18 states , the common search term associated with them was ' boring '			1
among those considered snoozeworthy included @entity87 , @entity88			0
but @entity4 was n't all negative			0
when the state of @entity91 was searched , autocomplete terms that appeared were : ' cold ' , ' healthy ' , ' skinny ' and ' awesome '			0
venture capitalist @entity7 , a recent @entity65 transplant to @entity93 , said in her blog about the experiment : ' i started wondering , how do @entity15 really think about " those people " in other states ? what are the most common stereotypes ? ' ' the qualitative searches were most interesting to me			1
there are 12 unique terms that are classifiable as " culture / sentiment " queries , of which ten are negative : backwards , bad , boring , crazy , dangerous , hated , racist , stupid , trashy , weird			1
' there were a few redeeming positive results ; @entity91 , @entity108 , @entity44 , and @entity109 are " awesome , " and @entity88 , @entity110 , and @entity65 are " great "			0
' but for the most part , it does n’t seem like we think very nice things about each other … at the very least , we ’re more inclined to search for articles supporting ( or related to ) negative biases			0
' the single most common result of all was " boring , " which appeared for 18 states with no particular regional concentration			1
other popular terms ( returned for > 10 states ) were " humid " , " windy " , " expensive " , and " liberal "			0
' strangely , @entity123 and @entity124 both returned " haunted " ; apparently there are a lot of ghost sightings ( and related walking tours )			0
' my favorite result of all was " enchanting " : @entity131 is beautiful			0

research shows people ask search engine why @entity26 is so ' racist '
for 18 states , the common search term associated with them was ' boring '
