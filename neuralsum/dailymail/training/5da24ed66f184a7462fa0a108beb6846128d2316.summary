by @entity0 published : 14:35 est , 21 february 2013 updated : 18:44 est , 21 february 2013 suspect : @entity1 who is linked to a raid on a @entity3 in @entity4 could not be charged despite having £ 5,500 in cash on him when robbers snatched £ 17,000 from a security guard outside a @entity3 , police had a pretty good idea who might have done it			1
a short distance away , three criminals – including two robbers – were employed on day release from prison			1
one was found with more than £ 5,500 in cash in his pocket and a nearby shed , and refused to say where it came from			2
another matched the description of a one - legged man acting suspiciously in the restaurant			2
but extraordinarily , none will face charges because the @entity28 says there is insufficient evidence			0
despite this , the money has been confiscated after magistrates decided that , on the balance of probability , it had been taken in the raid			2
and @entity1 , 59 , the man found with the cash , is now on the run after absconding from another open prison			1
the astonishing story began when a security guard was collecting takings from the @entity3 in @entity4 on november 7 , 2011 , and was approached by two able - bodied men			1
they shoved her to the ground as they snatched a case she was carrying and ran away			0
within hours @entity50 had arrested @entity1 and two unnamed men aged 36 and 44			2
one was a one - legged man who was shown on cctv hobbling into the restaurant on crutches			0
it is understood he later confirmed he had been there – but only to get food			0
accomplice : a man pictured on @entity53 believed to be linked to the robbery at @entity3 in @entity4 , @entity61 , in november 2011 crime scene : the @entity63 's in @entity4 , @entity61 , where a @entity65 security guard was pushed to the ground and £ 17,000 was stolen in november 2011 all three were on a work placement a mile away at @entity68 after being allowed out of @entity70 open prison , near @entity71			1
police found £ 5,513 in @entity1 ’s pocket and a paint shed at the football ground , to which he held a key			1
none of the rest of the stolen cash has been recovered			2
during a hearing under the @entity83 at @entity81 , @entity50 ’s @entity80 said : ‘ mr @entity1 was identified as being a possible suspect and the key being found in his possession that would open the paint store would lend itself [ to believing ] that the money was involved in that robbery			1
’ but prosecutor @entity90 said the case had not met the burden of proof required to bring charges			0
she also revealed @entity1 had absconded from another open prison , @entity96 in @entity97 , @entity98			1
employer : mr @entity1 was on day release working at @entity68 , pictured , when the robbery took place open prison : @entity1 had been serving a life sentence at @entity70 in @entity71 , @entity61 he has been at large since failing to return from day release on january 23			1
@entity1 was given six life sentences at the @entity107 in 2000 for carrying out a series of armed robberies at betting shops before escaping on a bicycle			1
the career criminal , who has convictions dating back to the 1970s , was on licence at the time after being sentenced to nine years for a robbery plot			0
a @entity28 spokesman said : ‘ we have made the decision not to charge in this case due to the lack of essential forensic evidence			0
it would be difficult to prove a link between the defendant and the alleged offence			0
‘ the defendant could not be identified by independent witnesses			0
if any new evidence comes to light , the case can be reviewed			0
’ sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
