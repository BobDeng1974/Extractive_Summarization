the vehicle , driven by an elderly man , was considered to be so dangerous that police had to close the road			2
@entity11 , near the junction with @entity13 in @entity14 , @entity15 , was closed to other traffic while officers were safe - guarding the car			1
extraordinary : passers - by were left wondering this morning how the car got on to the kerb and left hanging above the double yellow lines in @entity22 @entity13 closed : the @entity4 hangs precariously above the double yellow lines in @entity11 in @entity14 , @entity15 this morning			1
emergency services were waiting for recovery teams to remove the car the driver , however , was nowhere to be seen			1
although it looked as though it would tip down onto the winding street below any moment , the the driver obviously thought it was stable enough to leave there			0
the unusual parking was spotted by it worker @entity35 as he made his way to work in @entity14			0
he said : ' i just could n't believe my eyes when i saw this			0
' i do n't know how someone was able to even drive their car into such a position , let alone manage to get out of it while leaving it like that			0
hanging in there : passers - by were scratching their heads as to how the driver managed to park his @entity4 while officers closed off @entity11 to remove the car ' they might have a problem moving it off again though - especially if the traffic warden gets hold of them			1
' meanwhile , in @entity58 , @entity59 , last week this taxi driver fared no better			2
he was taken to hospital with minor injuries after he careered into the street side gap on @entity58 's @entity63 next to @entity64			0
the driver of this cab did n't fare any better : he was taken to hospital with minor injuries after careering into the @entity58 's @entity63 next to @entity64 he ended up almost vertical in this stone stairwell			1

emergency services arrived to remove the car , but *feared* it might roll over
