@entity0 have voted @entity2 vacuum cleaners as better than anything @entity0 can make themselves @entity4 vacuum cleaners are better than anything @entity0 firms make – say the @entity0 themselves			1
the company founded by sir @entity8 , who reinvented the vacuum cleaner by doing away with the bag , came top in a study of consumers by @entity0 ’s @entity14			1
@entity0 families rated @entity8 above their own @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21			1
it is a rare example of a @entity2 manufacturer still run by its founder that is not only doing rather well in this country , but has carried the flag for innovation and quality around the world			1
indeed , @entity8 cleaners are also the market leader in the home of technology , @entity35 , in terms of the value and volume of sales			1
they are also number one in terms of value in @entity43 and @entity44 , while it is reporting strong growth in @entity47 , where companies have a reputation for ripping off successful ideas and creating their own cheaper versions			0
the study ’s findings were welcomed by @entity8 ’s @entity0 chief executive , @entity54 , who said : ‘ @entity0 consumers rate us ahead of their home grown companies , like @entity20 and @entity16			1
‘ it disproves the common thinking that only @entity0 can manufacture world - class technology			2
interestingly we are seeing a similar pattern in @entity35 , where we are now number one , overtaking home grown successes in their own back yard			0
‘ it seems we are ‘ out - germaning the @entity0 ! ’			2
‘ @entity8 ’s prowess means it has become a magnet for graduates and engineers , creating thousands of jobs in highly skilled jobs in this country , while its machines are made in @entity73			2
today – 22 years after it got rid of the bag - it is unveiling its latest improved vacuum cleaner the @entity78			1
the big change is that having done away with the bag , the new cleaner has now removed the need for a filter that – in other machines – can become clogged and needs to be cleaned or replaced			2
on most existing so - called cyclone machines the filter is needed to hold the finest particles of dust that are sucked up to prevent them clogging up the tubes			0
however , the @entity8 team found that if they created flexible tips on the tubes which funnel the dust into the machine , they vibrate so quickly that the tiny particles can not block them			0
the company was founded by sir @entity8 , pictured with prime minister @entity99 , who reinvented the vacuum cleaner by doing away with the bag the flexible tips , which it calls @entity104 , vibrate 350 times a second which means dust as small as 0.5 microns , which is smaller than a skin cell , are spun through the machine and into the collecting bin			1
sir @entity8 said : ‘ removing the bag from a vacuum solved one hassle , but filter maintenance remained an annoying problem that needed fixing			1
' @entity8 engineers have spent six years perfecting cyclone technology to make filter maintenance obsolete			0
' the constant flexing of @entity104 tips ensures the cyclones do not block as microscopic dust is spun out of the air – not trapped in a cyclone or on a filter			0
’ the technology is the result of nearly six years intensive research and development by a team of 29 @entity8 engineers			0
some 2,000 prototypes were developed whilst creating the new technology			0
the company said the removal of the need for a filter , which can become clogged , means the machine remains a constant high level of suction , so removing dirt and dust particles that can trigger allergies			0
its new @entity78 machine is available from its website with a price tag of £ 459.99 .			0
