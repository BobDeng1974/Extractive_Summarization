by @entity0 published : 09:27 est , 10 december 2012 updated : 20:54 est , 10 december 2012 so , just what attracts a mild - mannered tabby to a life of crime ? the answer , if you look closely , is the magnet hanging from her collar			1
this is @entity11 , the cat burglar responsible for pinching more than 20 sets of keys from her neighbours in the past month			1
magnetic moggy : @entity11 's collar had been fitted with a magnet to stop other cats getting into her home her unsuspecting owner @entity22 had no idea of @entity11 ’s other life until she caught her coming through the catflap with the evidence jangling around her neck			1
and it was only when she found a collection of keys dotted around her house and garden that she realised the extent of the crime spree			2
miss @entity22 , a 27 - year - old office worker , had fitted @entity11 with a magnetic collar to automatically unlock the catflap at her home			1
this stopped other cats from slipping through and eating @entity11 ’s food			2
cat burglar : @entity11 stole more than 20 sets of house and car keys as she roamed around north east @entity44 well intentioned : owner @entity22 fitted @entity11 with the collar to stop other cats getting into her home what she did n’t realise was that @entity11 had also been making herself at home at the neighbours ’ houses , which did n’t have her sort of high - tech protection			1
slipping through their cat flaps , and skulking through their rooms , she picked up all manner of things thanks to the magnet in her collar			2
most of them were keys			0
at first neighbours in @entity65 , @entity44 , thought they were misplacing them but last week they started putting two and two together when they realised there had been a spate of thefts			0
the game was finally up when miss @entity22 caught @entity11 arriving home with her latest haul			2
a search produced 12 sets of keys in the back garden and eight dotted around her home – as well as another six sets in neighbours ’ gardens			0
she also unearthed dozens of metal items scattered around her house , including nails , pins , screws and bolts			0
‘ i had no idea what she was getting up to all day when i was at work , ’ she said			0
‘ obviously she likes roaming around and sneaking into other people ’s homes and it just so happens that her magnetic collar kept picking up their spare keys			0
‘ i ’ve given all the keys back and luckily my neighbours have seen the funny side of it			0
’ case closed : @entity22 solved the mystery when @entity11 walked in with keys around her neck			1

@entity106 were left mystified as their house and car keys kept *vanishing*
