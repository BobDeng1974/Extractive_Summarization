' @entity48 tweeted , ' today show debuts new orange set			2
as a result , @entity51 and @entity52 will require @entity55 chip implants in case they blend in and get lost			0
' ' the new @ todayshow set looks terrible ! ! i am sincerely shocked			0
and the burnt orange couch ? i ca n't ! ' tweeted @entity62			0
some critics were of the same opinion			0
' @entity9 's venerable @entity30 unveiled a new set and tried to unveil a new attitude on monday morning , but the orange - tinged hues looked more than a little desperate , ' wrote tv critic @entity68 in the @entity69			1
@entity16 , daily : today 's new team member shows viewers around the @entity72 friend in need : @entity19 helps @entity20 remove some kale from her teeth on their new orange sofa the @entity78 describes the set as ' the way your tv screen would look if someone punched a hole in the top and poured in a glass of orange juice			1

it includes a new anchor desk that can spin 360 degrees , an ' interactive weather wall ' made up of six screens that can come apart and the @entity72 , a digital studio that will allow multi-platform reporting and will be presided over by @entity16			0
interactive : the today team test out their new interactive @entity72 by skyping with a viewer @entity101 you glad : none of the today team will ever wear orange again , lest they blend into their bright sofa a recurring sunrise motif - though some have pointed out that it actually looks more like a sunset - decorates the studio			0

@entity9 's *beleaguered* morning show has unveiled a new set

critics and viewers have expressed *distaste* at the ' 1970s ' style of the set
