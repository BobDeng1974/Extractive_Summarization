by @entity0 an obese woman who was convinced her crippling stomach pains were the result of overeating lost 5st - only to discover she had cancer			1
@entity6 , 38 , reached 17.5st due to a diet of crisps , chocolate and takeaways			1
but after shedding the weight through a meal replacement plan , she found herself still suffering frequent stomach pains			1
@entity6 was 17st and suffered from stomach ache - she thought due to overeating			1
after losing 5st ( right ) she was still in pain - and tests revealed she had kidney cancer ms @entity6 ( pictured before her weight loss ) had to have one of her kidneys removed after her diagnosis in november 2012 the mother - of - two , from @entity24 , @entity25 , went to her gp and was immediately referred for a scan			1
this showed she had stage one kidney cancer			2
surgeons at the @entity31 in @entity32 removed her left kidney and , to her relief , she is now in remission			2
ms @entity6 , who is now a size 12 , believes had she not lost the weight , she may never have been diagnosed with cancer			1
she said : ' when you ’re big you worry about clothes and looking bad , but you do n’t always consider the impacts			0
' being that big you also do n’t listen to your body			0
you ’re not in tune - you ’ll eat when you ’re full and you do n’t stop when you feel sick			0
' therefore if you have pains you put it down to having a bit too much food and you get used to the stomach aches - so when i had cancer i had no idea at all			2
' stomach pain can be a sign of kidney cancer , but usually in the later stages			1
in a bid to shift the weight , ms @entity6 switched to eating off side plates and ditched processed food			2
but when the stomach pain continued , she went to see her gp			0
she said : ' had i not done that , i do n’t know if i would be here now			0
ms @entity6 ( pictured since her weight loss with partner @entity64 ) is now a size 12 and is in remission from the cancer ' i would still be walking around with the tumour which would have got bigger or spread and could have been life threatening			1
' ' after having the tumour removed i made a pledge that i was n’t going to just maintain my weight but i wanted to get fit too			0
' two years on , ms @entity6 now runs her own weight loss company , called @entity74 , and has gone on to lose a further 1.5st			0
kidney cancer is the eighth most common cancer in adults in the @entity78 , with 9,300 people diagnosed each year			1
if found in stage one there is a 90 per cent chance of survival			0
but if left and discovered in stage four there is just a 10 per cent chance of living for another five years			0
the disease is more likely to affect people who are overweight and smoke .			0
