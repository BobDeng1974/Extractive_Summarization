@entity0 will travel to this month 's @entity1 in @entity2 with only one out - and - out striker after coach @entity4 cut @entity5 from his final 23 - man squad on monday			1
@entity7 forward @entity5 joined defender @entity8 and left back @entity9 , still nursing a knee injury , as the three players left out of the final squad after being included in a provisional selection for a training camp in @entity15			2
@entity5 's exclusion came as a surprise given the stocky striker 's physical strength and all - round play were seen as a good alternative to veteran 35 - year - old forward @entity22			1
' all three are players who still have the chance to take part in several big tournaments in their careers			0
' attacking midfielder @entity38 played as a striker in the 2 - 2 warmup draw against @entity41 on sunday			0
low , however , included @entity43 's @entity42 , who can play as left back , in the final squad after he won his first cap on sunday as well as first - choice keeper @entity47 and captain @entity48 , who are racing to get fit following injuries			0
little - known @entity8 , a surprise call - up in the provisional squad , made way for a more experienced backline , arguably @entity0 's weakest point while @entity9 paid the price for missing too much training due to his injury			0
@entity0 take on @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 in @entity61 goalkeepers : @entity47 ( @entity23 ) , @entity63 ( @entity43 ) , @entity64 ( @entity65 96 ) defenders : @entity67 ( @entity23 ) , @entity68 ( @entity43 ) , @entity42 ( @entity43 ) , @entity69 ( @entity70 04 ) , @entity71 ( @entity43 ) , @entity72 ( @entity73 ) , @entity48 ( @entity23 ) midfielders : @entity75 ( @entity70 04 ) , @entity76 ( @entity77 ) , @entity38 ( @entity23 ) , @entity78 ( @entity79 ) , @entity80 ( @entity81 ) , @entity82 ( @entity23 ) , @entity27 ( @entity23 ) , @entity83 ( @entity73 ) , @entity84 ( @entity73 ) , @entity85 ( @entity43 ) , @entity86 ( @entity87 ) , @entity88 ( @entity23 ) forward : @entity22 ( @entity90 )			1

@entity27 likely to play further forward
@entity22 is *chasing* the all - time @entity1 *goalscoring* *record*
