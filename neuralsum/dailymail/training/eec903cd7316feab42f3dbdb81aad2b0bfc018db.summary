by @entity0 @entity1 : 05:06 est , 21 december 2013 @entity2 : 08:35 est , 21 december 2013 @entity4 's dreams look set to come true this year as forecasters predict a white @entity6 across the @entity7			1
the heavy winds , rain and flooding which have battered the nation in recent weeks are set to continue right up to december 25			1
but on christmas eve , temperatures will plummet , leaving some parts of the country covered in snow by morning - albeit a light dusting			1
according to the @entity18 , heavy rain will pass late on christmas eve to make way for snowfall across the @entity7 parts of the @entity7 , including the @entity22 , already have a light coating of snow that will thicken @entity25 , chief forecaster with the @entity18 , said : ' we can expect stormy weather in many areas to start the @entity6 week , but looking forward to @entity29 and @entity30 we are expecting it to turn colder , with a mix of wintry showers and sunny spells but for wind speeds to drop			1
' so there is a chance that some places may see a @entity6			1
' officially , a white @entity6 is defined as just one single snowflake falling from the sky			1
but those hoping to bring the sledge down from the loft or dress a snowman with scarf and hat might be a little disappointed - unless you live in the mountains of @entity49			1
' it 's not going to be cold enough for widespread snow , it 's more of a showery picture , ' said @entity55 , from weather forecasters @entity57			2
' there will be a bit of sleet and snow on the higher ground , such as the hills of @entity64 and in northern @entity65 , and wintry showers will be heavy in the mountains of @entity49			1
rain : extreme weather conditions have battered the @entity7 for days , filling rivers and streams , like this one in @entity71 , to the brim			2
rain is set to continue right up until december 25 ' but it 's probably not going to be a @entity6 in central @entity75			1
' widespread covering of snow on the ground - where more than 40 per cent of @entity7 's stations reported snow on the ground at 9am - has happened just four times in the last 52 years			2
@entity6 2010 was the last white @entity6			1
with a thick layer of snow coating the nation , it was extremely unusual			2
snow on the ground was recorded at 83 per cent of stations , the highest ever recorded , and snow or sleet also fell at 19 per cent of stations			2
while most dream of gardens blanketed with crisp , white snow , the @entity18 says the definition is of a single snowflake falling in the 24 hours of december 25			1
but we are often left disappointed as climate history shows wintry weather is more likely between january and march			0
@entity101 or sleet falls on average five days in december , compared to 7.6 days in january , 6.8 days in february and six days in march			0
but we can remain optimistic as at least one snowflake has fallen on 38 @entity104 in the last 52 years			2
@entity101 lying on the ground on @entity30 is much rarer			0
@entity106 were more frequent in the 18th and 19th centuries , according to the @entity18			0
the change of calendar in 1752 , which effectively brought @entity30 back by 12 days , also minimised the chances			0
climate change has also brought higher average temperatures over land and sea , which generally reduces the probability of a white @entity6			1
but experts claim that will not make them less likely in the future			0
there was also a white @entity6 in 2009 , when 13 per cent of stations recorded snow or sleet falling , and 57 per cent reported snow on the ground			1
until then , the weather is set to be blustery and extreme across the nation			0
much of the weekend will be cool and showery , the @entity18 said , with low pressure developing over the @entity128 on sunday and passing to the north west of the @entity7 on monday and into tuesday			0
that low pressure will bring widespread strong winds and heavy rain from monday morning for 24 hours , and the @entity18 has issued severe weather warnings for wind and rain across the @entity136 and northern areas of the @entity7 for the next few days , bringing the possibility of flooding			1
travellers expected to crowd on to trains , boats and planes over @entity6 have been warned to take care as @entity7 enters some of the busiest days of the year for the transport system			2
those hoping for an easy ride could find the journey hampered by a stormy few days			0
parts of western @entity49 could see up to 20in of rain , and 10 to 15in the south - west of @entity65 as the unsettled outlook continues			1
the rest of the @entity7 will also see much the same which has led to a series of weather warnings being put in place for later with gale force winds and more heavy rain forecast			1
@entity18 forecaster @entity158 warned that anyone using the roads for their @entity6 getaways should be careful			2
he said : ' driving conditions wo n't be good , there will be strong winds across the country today and rain			0
we would advise people to allow extra time for their journeys and drive to the conditions			0
' a spokesman for the @entity173 said : ' people who are set to be away from home for the festive period are urged to check the flood situation and take precautionary steps to prepare , for example by moving valuable items to safety , before travelling			0
' people are also urged to check the flood risk situation for their journey and at their destination			0
' people are also being urged not to drive through dangerous flood water			0
the @entity173 has teams on the ground checking flood defences and monitoring river levels and will have teams ready to respond throughout the @entity6 period			2
' travellers are warned to take care when driving over the @entity6 period as temperatures plummet a white @entity6 is technically when one snowflake falls , which has happened 38 christmases in the last 52 years			1
widespread snow has only occurred four times in the same time period @entity202 , head of on - road services at the @entity204 , said : ' we are working closely with the @entity18 to monitor conditions ahead of the weather being forecast for next week			0
' road users are urged to check traffic and weather conditions before setting out on journeys and to heed any advice such as speed restrictions once they are on motorways and major trunk roads			0
' we aware of sudden gusts of wind , and give high - sided vehicles , caravans , motorbikes and bicycles plenty of space			0
in the event of persistent high winds we may need to close certain bridges to traffic for a period , so please be alert for warnings of closures and follow signposted diversion routes			0

heavy rain and wind to subside on christmas eve with snow by morning
just one snowflake needs to fall for it to be technically a white @entity6
forecasters predict light coating across @entity64 , the north and @entity49
