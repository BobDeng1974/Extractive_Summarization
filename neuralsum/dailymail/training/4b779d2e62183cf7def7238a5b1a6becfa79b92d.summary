@entity5 's ‘ right - hand man ’ in @entity6 has provoked fury by insisting @entity1 will definitely remain in the @entity2 after the promised referendum in 2017			1
lord @entity7 suggested that the result of the vote was a foregone conclusion			1
@entity11 claimed the @entity15 peer had ‘ let the cat out of the bag ’ , saying the comments proved that the prime minister ’s real plan was to keep us in the @entity2 no matter what			2
lord @entity7 told @entity21 that the @entity2 will remain a family of 28 member states in 2019 - including the @entity1 @entity24 insists that the only way to get a plebiscite on @entity2 membership is to vote @entity15 at the next election			1
lord @entity7 made his prediction as he was grilled for a second time by @entity21 , who had to ratify his appointment as @entity2 commissioner for financial services			1
he set out his vision for @entity35 in 2019 to show how he would work to beef up the @entity2			2
he said : ‘ big picture for 2019 : the @entity2 is stronger and more cohesive – and more responsive to the economic and political concerns of its citizens			2
and our @entity2 , by the way , remains a family of 28 member states – including the @entity1			1
’ mr @entity5 has pledged tough negotiations to claw back powers from @entity6 , such as controls on movement across the continent			0
an in - out referendum would then be held by the end of 2017			2
but @entity11 ’s @entity52 said lord @entity7 ’s confident prediction that @entity1 will remain in the @entity2 showed that the vote was a sham			1
mr @entity52 , who defected from the @entity56 to @entity11 and is standing in tomorrow ’s @entity57 by - election , said : ‘ this confirms what i said when i resigned : that the inner clique have an underhand plan to keep us in the @entity2			2
‘ they are promising us a referendum and they are talking the language of change – but in reality they are doing everything they can to keep us in			0
his lordship has let the cat out of the bag			0
‘ one of the reasons i left the @entity15 was when i realised it was all smoke and mirrors			0
i could n’t be part of it any longer			0
’ eurosceptic conservatives were also angered by the comments			0
@entity11 's @entity52 , pictured , said the proposed referendum by @entity5 was ' a sham ' conservative mp @entity87 , pictured , said the future of @entity1 in @entity35 will be down to the electorate @entity87 , mp for @entity90 , said : ‘ @entity7 is entitled to his opinion , frankly under @entity5 ’s referendum it will not be @entity7 who decides – it ’ll be the @entity1 people			1
‘ i ’ll have a 10p bet with @entity7 that come 2017 we ’ll be out of @entity35 and the country will be heading for a better future			2
‘ it seems as though @entity7 will make an excellent @entity2 commissioner because he is already talking the language of the @entity2 elite , because he thinks his views matter more than the @entity1 people			1
’ after a first hearing last week , lord @entity7 was summoned back to the @entity106 because @entity21 wanted further assurances that he would not solely fight @entity1 and the @entity109 ’s corner after taking up his commission post on november 1			1
under pressure from @entity21 , he has distanced himself from ‘ double majority ’ voting in the @entity2 ’s banking authority , a key concession won by @entity1 last year			1
it means that for important banking regulation to pass , a ‘ double majority ’ of eurozone and non-eurozone countries must support it , protecting the @entity109 from discrimination by @entity120 or @entity121			0
the measure was introduced after a protracted battle by chancellor @entity126 to prevent the eurozone acting as a voting bloc on financial regulation following last year ’s ‘ banking union ’ for members of the single currency			0
the conservative peer wrote to @entity21 : ‘ if confirmed , i will be a @entity35 commissioner , serving the general interest , not any one member state ’s interest			0
