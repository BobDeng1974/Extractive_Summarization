by @entity0 published : 20:43 est , 18 march 2013 updated : 07:58 est , 19 march 2013 in 2002 a previously unknown star stunned stargazers when it suddenly flared up to briefly become the brightest star in the sky			0
the star , @entity9 , produced a stellar flash so brilliant that scientists had never seen anything like it before - then , just as suddenly , it faded			1
a stellar flash like this was unprecedented because supernovas and novas typically expel matter out into space , often obscuring them from view			2
@entity9 produced enough energy in a brief flash to illuminate surrounding dust , like a spelunker taking a flash picture of the walls of an undiscovered cavern			2
the star presumably ejected the illuminated dust shells in previous outbursts			0
light from the latest outburst travels to the dust and then is reflected to @entity49			2
because of this indirect path , the light arrives at @entity49 months after light from the star that traveled directly toward @entity49			0
now @entity25 has released an artist 's impression , created using the @entity57 , that appears to show @entity59 expel material into space , but what we are actually seeing is an outwardly moving ' light echo ' of the bright flash - about a million times solar luminosity - from 11 years ago			1
according to @entity25 , in a light echo , light from the flash is reflected by successively more distant rings in the complex array of ambient interstellar dust that already surrounded the star			1
it is still not known what caused the flare , but theories include an eruption caused by helium eruptions as the star entered its death throes , the swallowing of planets by @entity59 or that @entity59 is a very massive supergiant that underwent a thermonuclear event			1
the expansion took only a couple of months , meaning that its speed was abnormal			0
a paper with contributions from the @entity91 , the @entity92 and the @entity93 concluded : ' when combined with the high luminosity and unusual outburst behavior , these characteristics indicate that @entity9 represents a hitherto unknown type of stellar outburst , for which we have no completely satisfactory physical explanation			0
' @entity9 lies about 20,000 light years away toward the constellation of the unicorn ( hence the name @entity105 ) , while the light echo in the image spans about six light years in diameter			1
it appears that the star is considerably more massive and luminous than the @entity111 , perhaps five to ten times as big			0
@entity59 's light echo expanding over time : it produced a stellar flash so brilliant that scientists had never seen anything like it before			1

@entity57 images show the ' light echo ' from the unprecedented flare - up of a star
although theories abound , it is not yet known what caused the million times solar luminosity event
light from the flash is reflected by interstellar dust
