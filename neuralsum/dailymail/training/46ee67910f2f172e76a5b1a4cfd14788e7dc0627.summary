@entity0 may have lost out in the title race but they are top of the table when it comes to earnings over the 2013 - 14 season			2
@entity7 ' side finished two points behind @entity9 , who lifted the @entity12 trophy , but their projected earnings are £ 1m more			0
and the value of tv revenue and being in the top flight can be seen by bottom club @entity17 , who received just £ 1.2m as a merit payment , picking up £ 64m when television and @entity12 share is factored in			2
each side received £ 54m for just being in the @entity12 , then their performances and tv lure is factored in			0
there was potential for teams such as @entity41 to earn up to £ 4m from the last round of matches but the positions stayed largely the same			0
@entity45 might not be popular with @entity47 fans but @entity48 will be pleased that his manager has brought in nearly £ 79m			0
money goal : @entity52 's late winner at @entity53 bagged @entity54 an extra £ 1.2m over achievers ? @entity47 's final - day defeat at @entity0 cost them £ 1.2m in prize money but they still brought in £ 79m in total looking up : @entity59 masterminded @entity61 's escape act and that netted the club a tidy sum but the @entity65 ' defeat at @entity0 on the final day allowed @entity54 - 2 - 1 victors at @entity53 - to leapfrog them into ninth and so collect the extra £ 1.2m in prize money			1
and the £ 66m picked up by @entity68 , the £ 65m banked by @entity69 and @entity17 's £ 64m will give them a financial advantage in next season 's @entity71			0
perhaps the most significant increase in windfall , however , was that of @entity61 's			1
they climbed from bottom to 14th during the final weeks of the season to pocket £ 8.4m in merit money , as opposed to £ 1.2m had they finished in 20th			1
cashing in : @entity0 earned £ 99m this season but just missed out on the title the real winners : @entity9 celebrate their @entity12 title triumph			1

@entity9 earned £ *98m* after winning the title
@entity29 got £ *91m* despite finishing *seventh*
@entity61 's escape act earned them an extra £ 7.2m
@entity54 's final - day victory bagged them £ 1.2m
