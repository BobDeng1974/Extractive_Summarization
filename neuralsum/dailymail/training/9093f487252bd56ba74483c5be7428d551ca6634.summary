by @entity0 published : 06:38 est , 17 may 2013 updated : 07:21 est , 17 may 2013 a grieving family has received an apology from a lettings agency who invited potential tenants to view the home of a much - loved father and grandfather while his body was still inside			1
@entity10 , 88 , died peacefully at the bungalow he cherished in @entity12 , @entity13 , on april 19			1
within two hours of his death , his daughter @entity14 , 65 , notified @entity16 , who then posted details of the bungalow being available for rent on its website			2
in shock : the family of @entity10 , 88 , were barely coming to terms with his death when prospective tenants arrived to look at his rented house in @entity13 ( pictured ) would - be tenants were allowed to visit the exterior of the property and even looked through the windows and the letter box as mr @entity10 ’s body was in his bedroom and the family was holding a wake			1
intrusion : visitors began looking through the letterbox and windows while mr @entity10 's body was still inside in preparation for his funeral the family had decided not to move the grandfather from the home he had shared with his late wife @entity45 for 18 years			1
mr @entity10 ’s close - knit family today said the ' intrusion into their privacy ' had left them heartbroken			2
granddaughter @entity51 , 38 , said : ' we all had a lot on our minds at the time and my mum was just being courteous			0
' we had no idea it would be put on the bidding market within two hours			2
' if we had known there would be people turning up we would have paid the extra rent for a couple of weeks			0
' it is absolutely disgusting that people were knocking on the door when my granddad was being laid to rest in his bedroom			1
' @entity70 , lettings manager for @entity71 today issued an apology to the family			0
he said : ' when a property becomes available , our usual procedure is to advertise it as soon as possible to allow us to promptly re-let homes to customers with a housing need			0
' our adverts do not give details of specific addresses , however once a property is advertised it is not uncommon for potential applicants to visit the location and try to establish which property will shortly be coming available			0
mistake : @entity16 has said that it has reviewed its procedures after puttyng the house up for rent on its website within hours of mr @entity10 's death ' on this occasion , we advertised the property , but unfortunately on the same day we were contacted to notify us that the family was holding a wake			1
' once we became aware of the situation we contacted mr @entity10 ’s family to offer our apologies			0
' we are extremely sorry for the upset caused and are reviewing our procedures as a result of their experience			0

visitors looked through window while body of @entity10 was still inside
@entity110 admit they put home on website after two hours
' it is absolutely disgusting that people were knocking on the door when my granddad was being laid to rest in his bedroom , ' his granddaughter said
