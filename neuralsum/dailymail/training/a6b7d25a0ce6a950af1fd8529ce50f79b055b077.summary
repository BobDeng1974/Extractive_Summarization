' as most doctors today will tell you , post-traumatic stress is not a disorder			2
post-traumatic stress or @entity26 is an injury that can result from the experience of war			2
and like other injuries , @entity26 is treatable			0
' moving forward : former president @entity0 believes ptsd should stop being called a disorder because it stops employers from hiring sufferers @entity34 reported that , according to the @entity36 @entity35 which still uses the designation ' ptsd ' , about 30 percent of post 9/11 veterans suffer from the malady , which hinders their reintegration into civilian society			1
the result is that many former troops struggle to find work and often lack the necessary skills to move into employment			2
@entity0 said his institute has been working with @entity49 to study these issues and the results will be released in spring			1
he said the information will help employers understand what veterans have to offer , noting that both veterans and employers have a hard time translating military experience			1
' you do n't see many job postings that say : ' wanted : experience hunting insurgents and terrorists			0
willing to risk life for co-workers ' , ' @entity0 said			1
' or what 's a veteran supposed to put down ? my last office was a @entity71 ? ' he told @entity34 that he ' has a duty ' to ensure all veterans have a fighting chance			2
' obviously i get slightly emotional talking about our vets because i have an emotional … , ' he said , trailing off			1
' i ’m in there with them			0
these are men and women who volunteered in the face of danger			0
' i mean , they knew right after 9/11 that the nation would seek justice and to protect ourselves			2
and some got hurt , and some of them need a lot of help			0
and our nation owes a huge debt of gratitude			0
' healing : retired colonel @entity94 , left , gets a playful pat on the head from former president @entity0 during a break in this week 's ' empowering our nation 's @entity99 ' summit fair - minded : @entity101 , wife of vice president @entity102 , believes the community owes it to veterans to assist with their rehabilitation he said his institute will also work with higher education officials on how to recruit and retain veterans			1
