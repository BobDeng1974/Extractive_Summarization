author ] prescription errors : 47 per cent of deaths involved gps not providing sufficiently powerful medicine up to 800 asthma patients die needlessly every year because doctors prescribe the wrong medication or fail to monitor them properly			1
prescription errors are a factor in nearly half of the deaths , according to a study by doctors			2
other patients have not been offered check - ups or advice on how to avoid attacks			0
around 1,250 @entity18 die from asthma every year			1
the mortality rate is the third highest in @entity21 , behind only @entity22 and @entity23			0
and the latest figures show that the numbers have been steadily rising since 2009 when there were 1,140 deaths			0
in the largest study of its kind , the @entity28 closely examined the deaths of 195 @entity18 from asthma in 2012 and 2013 , including 28 children			1
they found prescription errors had occurred in 47 per cent of cases , with gps giving patients only short - term relieving inhalers rather than preventative medication that stops them having an attack			1
a further 10 per cent had been treated in hospital for asthma a month before they died but had been discharged without the correct medication and not been properly monitored since			0
more than a fifth had gone to @entity47 suffering an asthma attack at least once in the year before they died , including 11 per cent who had been admitted twice or more			2
care was particularly poor for children			1
the report concluded that in 26 out of the 28 child deaths there were ‘ potentially avoidable factors ’			0
overall , it found that 130 of the 195 deaths - 67 per cent - could have been prevented			2
the authors say these figures are consistent with previous , smaller studies into avoidable asthma deaths			1
if this is true across the @entity18 , then around 800 of the 1,250 deaths which occurred in 2012 could have been prevented			1
@entity65 , chief executive of the charity @entity66 , said the research ‘ has identified prescribing errors of a frankly horrifying scale and is a damning indictment of current routine practice ’			0
she added : ‘ in many of these cases the warning signs were ignored			0
’ dr @entity75 , clinical director at the @entity28 , said : ‘ it ’s time to end our complacency about asthma , which can , and does , kill			2
at risk : the study found that almost every child death involved preventable factors ‘ we have n’t paid enough attention to the importance of good routine asthma care by clinicians with the right training and experience and the part that patients themselves play in this			1
’ one of the main problems is that @entity37 were found to be prescribing too many ‘ reliever ’ inhalers – to be used during an asthma attack – instead of preventive ones which control the symptoms over the long term			2
dr @entity100 from the @entity28 – who is also a practising gp – said this may be partly due to cost pressures			0
the report found 39 per cent of patients had needed to be prescribed 12 or more reliever inhalers in a single year			0
this should have been a ‘ clear warning signal ’ to their gp that their asthma was out of control			0
professor @entity113 of @entity114 , who contributed to the research , said : ‘ this report shows how care has deteriorated since the last national analysis of asthma deaths in 2005			1
‘ these worrying statistics can and must be turned around in the next decade			0
’ about 5.4million @entity18 have been diagnosed with asthma , including 1.1million children .			1

1,250 *people* in @entity18 die from asthma a year - a figure which is *increasing*
study into asthma deaths by @entity28 found problems
largest study of its kind identified fault prescriptions in 47 *%* of cases
research into deaths of 28 children found their care particularly poor
