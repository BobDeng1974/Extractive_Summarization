by @entity0 follow @ @ draper_rob it is has been a long journey back to credibility since former @entity5 manager @entity4 sent @entity6 home in disgrace from the last @entity9 and @entity10 led the team ’s infamous mutiny in @entity13 , 2010			1
that episode prompted national outcry in @entity5 and an anguished debate over the identity of @entity18 , a team which had been powerful symbol of national unity in the @entity22 and @entity23 era but now had seemingly become a spoilt group of overpaid underachievers			1
even as recently as last november , when they lost the first leg of their @entity9 play - off against @entity31 2 - 0 , it seemed unlikely that the @entity33 public would fall back in love with their players			1
but a stirring 3 - 0 win at the @entity5 and now a major tournament with star players performing , no splits in the camp and an attacking team winning games , seems to be doing the trick			1
‘ there have been some up and downs in the past few years , i admit , ’ said the @entity56 goalkeeper			0
‘ but since the return leg against @entity31 in november we felt an enthusiasm behind the team			2
and in the friendly matches , we ’ve noticed a rekindled love between the team and our fans			2
‘ there are very high expectations to please the supporters and up to now we ’ve done what we needed to on the pitch to make them happy			0
but we want to go further and have all @entity33 people proud of the national team			0
’ on monday in @entity83 they take on @entity54 team that has been the latest @entity85 squad to be beset by bonus rows – resolved only on friday when the nation ’s president @entity87 intervened to ensure £ 2.25million of back payments arrived in @entity90			1
if @entity5 can get past @entity54 a potential quarter final with @entity92 looms			1
dark days : @entity5 's previous @entity9 was disrupted by players revolting against coach @entity4 turning point : @entity5 's comeback play - off win against @entity31 got the nation back on side it ’s enough to bring back memories of the @entity103 team , the current manager having of course been captain in the final – because of @entity109 ’s suspension - when @entity5 won the @entity9 in 1998			1
‘ they are a reference for all @entity33 players for future generations of footballers , ’ said @entity51			0
‘ i grew up watching them on tv and they are an example to all of us on the pitch and especially as a collective unit			0
' they achieved a lot			0
they did wonderful things in 1998 and 2006 and we try to be inspired by that			0
’ role models : @entity23 holds aloft the @entity9 after @entity5 's victory in 1998 disruptive influence ? @entity132 playmaker @entity131 was omitted from the @entity9 squad @entity51 ; @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity10 ; @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 ; @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 @entity23 , who axed @entity131 from this squad , has himself has been part of the healing process			1
@entity10 , who led the munity of 2010 and was subsequently banned from the national team for five games , is now fully rehabilitated and now one of the manager ’s key lieutenants in the group			1
it was @entity155 who signed @entity10 from @entity156 for @entity157 when he 22 years old , a move that provided a springboard to his move to @entity161			2
‘ we go a long way back , ’ said @entity23			2
‘ he was 22 years old when i met him when i was at @entity157			0
@entity10 is very , very experienced player , it ’s his ninth season with @entity161 , he ’s won a lot of titles and been a captain there			2
he ’s a winner and he ’s accustomed to big matches and he ’s prepared very well for to be ready for this @entity9			0
’ re-integrated : @entity10 ( @entity172 ) has gone from outcast to an important member of @entity176 's team @entity23 is under pressure to replace the criticised @entity139 in midfield but @entity136 is expected to fill in for @entity179 in central defence due to @entity183 ’s player ’s calf injury			1
but @entity23 has made light of the fact that both @entity5 and @entity54 were refused permission by @entity187 to train at the £ 600 @entity188 in @entity83 because of fears about the playing surface			1
‘ @entity187 wanted to protect the pitch for the upcoming matches after this one , ‘ said @entity23			0
‘ so we have to adapt and go to another stadium to train			0
we have to take everything with a smile			0

@entity5 have fallen back in love with their team at the @entity9

turning point came in comeback 3 - 0 play - off win against @entity31
