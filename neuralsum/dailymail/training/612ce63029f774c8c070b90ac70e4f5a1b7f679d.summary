do you know someone inspirational ? the search for the 2013 winner is on the @entity4 is proud to be running our seventh @entity5 , in association with @entity8 and the charity shelter			0
over the coming weeks , we want you to nominate the special women who deserve to be recognised			0
here , we tell the story of one of our remarkable nominees			0
when @entity15 learned her four - year - old son @entity16 had an incurable condition which would cause him slowly to go blind , she held him close and wept , grieving for the sight he would lose , imagining his life in a blanket of darkness			1
and then she decided to try to save him			2
@entity15 well knew how devastating the condition - choroideremia - could be , as it had left her grandfather blind at 39			1
she tracked down a scientist at @entity26 in @entity27 who was carrying out research on mice in the hope of one day developing a treatment			1
' my husband @entity33 and i went to see him , ' says @entity15			1
' afterwards , we looked at each other and said : “ he 's not going to stop until there 's a cure			1
we 've got to help him			0
” ' they decided to raise money to help with the research			1
it started in 2005 with a coffee morning , and quickly built up to golf days , school discos , marathons and bike rides			0
eight years on , @entity15 has so far raised the staggering sum of £ 300,000			1
the result ? in october 2010 , the world 's first clinical trial for a treatment for @entity55 began			1
it 's no exaggeration to say the trial was only possible because of @entity15 's contributions			1
campaigner : @entity15 with 13 - year - old son @entity16			1
@entity15 has raised £ 300,000 to help cure @entity16 's choroideremia @entity62 , professor of ophthalmology at the @entity64 , who is leading the two - year trial , says @entity15 's fundraising is ' the single most significant factor that enabled our team of researchers to lead the world in starting the first clinical trial for this disease '			1
the results of the trial will be published next month , and @entity15 has met some of the participants			1
' all of them have had an improvement , ' she says			0
' one man who used only to be able to read 17 letters at a time can now read 37			0
another , who has lost night vision , said he can see the stars again			0
' @entity15 knows it may be five years before the treatment becomes available to help @entity16 , now 13 - as the team must do more studies and monitor the participants to ensure the treatment is effective and safe			1
' but it 's hugely encouraging , ' she says			2
@entity55 is a genetic condition that causes the degeneration of the choroid			1
this layer of blood vessels at the back of the eye provides oxygen for the retina , which converts beams of light into images , allowing a person to see			0
the first symptom is night blindness , or being unable to see in dark surroundings , which tends to start in childhood			2
next the sufferer loses peripheral vision , and then central vision			0
the rate at which choroideremia progresses varies - @entity15 's grandfather was n't diagnosed until his 20s			1
the condition is passed down through a faulty gene on the x chromosome			2
women have two x chromosomes , so if they carry the faulty gene they will have a healthy version of the gene on their other x chromosome , protecting them from developing it			0
devastating : @entity55 is a genetic condition that causes the degeneration of the blood vessels that provide oxygen for the retina , resulting in blindness that 's why only men , who have just one x chromosome , develop it if they have the faulty gene			1
@entity15 's first child was a girl , @entity138 , then @entity16 arrived two years later			1
the couple have since had another son , @entity140 , now three			2
@entity15 knew she carried the faulty gene since she was tested aged seven			1
she and @entity33 , a builder , always knew that if they had a son , he would have a 50 per cent chance of having choroideremia			2
' i 've met parents who 've said if they 'd known they carried this gene they would n't have gone through with the pregnancy , but i do n't understand that thinking , ' says @entity15 , 41 , who works for a private equity company and lives with her family in @entity153 , @entity154			1
' we 'd never want to change @entity16 - he 's our child			1
' after @entity16 's birth , she took him to @entity160 in @entity27 to see if he was at risk			2
' the specialist told me to get him tested a bit later , ' she says			0
' at that point there was no sign of a cure and he said waiting a while would n't make any difference			2
' in february 2005 , when @entity16 was four , she went back to the specialist , who broke the awful news that @entity16 had the condition			2
' we burst into tears - me , @entity33 , and my mum			2
even though there were no signs of problems , we went through six months of grieving for the sight he 'd lose			0
' sometimes i 'd stand there with my eyes closed and think , is this what it 's going to be like for him ? ' from the start , she and @entity33 decided to talk to @entity16 openly about his condition			1
' what 's phenomenal is this is n't major donors writing enormous cheques			2
this is hard - slogging fundraising - cake sales , coffee mornings , friends and family pulling together to raise tiny amounts , bit by bit			1
[ @entity15 is ] an inspiration to us at the charity			1
' ' we told him his eyes were different from everybody else 's , and when he was older they would n't work as well , ' she says			0
' his friends have been great			0
when they go on school journeys , where there 's camping and night - time activities , they say : “ do n't worry , we 'll look after him			1
” ' but she admits that watching @entity16 grow up and start to understand has , at times , been unbearably sad			0
' when he was about seven , one night i heard him crying , ' says @entity15			1
' i sat on his bed and he said : “ will i go blind one day ? ” ' i explained this was why we were raising money			0
and that it would n't happen until he was much older			0
' he said , “ ok , that 's all right then , ” rolled over and went to sleep			0
it was heartbreaking , but made me more determined to carry on			0
' @entity15 admits that when she and her mother @entity230 set up the @entity231 in 2005 , she never expected to raise as much money			1
' but everywhere i went , people wanted to do something , and suddenly i was raising £ 60,000 a year			0
' @entity235 , chief executive of the charity @entity236 , which helps @entity15 run her fund , says she is ' astounded ' at the amount she 's raised			1
' very few people could do what she has done , ' she adds			0
' what 's phenomenal is this is n't major donors writing enormous cheques			0
this is hard - slogging fundraising - cake sales , coffee mornings , friends and family pulling together to raise tiny amounts , bit by bit			1
she 's an inspiration to us at the charity			0
' young promise : @entity16 , aged four , the age at which he and his family learned of his condition @entity15 has also become a great support for many other parents she has met who are affected by choroideremia			1
' the hardest thing is hearing from parents whose child has just been diagnosed , because it brings all those memories back			0
' the biggest reward has been the start of the clinical trial			0
with the help of @entity15 's money , the researchers at @entity26 discovered that in patients with choroideremia , when the cells of the choroid and retina die , they do not regenerate as they should			1
this has led to the development of a treatment injecting the eye with cells cultured from genes found in a healthy eye - the subject of the current trial ( funded in part by the @entity291 )			2
none of this would have happened without @entity15			2
phenomenal : @entity15 has raised the staggering sum of £ 300,000 to fund research on a cure for choroideremia as professor @entity62 explains : ' the problem with very rare diseases is they tend to not get funding for research			1
while choroideremia is rare , it 's devastating for those who have it			0
what 's more , the technology we 're developing is relevant to other causes of blindness , including age - related macular degeneration			1
' @entity15 says while her primary aim was to help her son , everything she does ' will help other families with choroideremia around the world '			1
' people tell me i must be so excited , but i wo n't be until @entity16 has his first appointment to have it , ' says @entity15			2
' he 's told me how proud he is of everything we 're doing			0
' for now , @entity16 is a normal , happy teenage boy			0
' sometimes i feel anxious about him , ' says @entity15			2
' i think how he might be if he ca n't play football any more , or if he 's not able to drive			0
but i look on the bright side and hope some of that attitude rubs off on @entity16			0
' what has happened is tragic for @entity16 and for us , but we 're so grateful for what we have			0
@entity16 can walk , he can talk and he can lead a full , happy life			0
' she and @entity33 have not yet had their younger son , @entity140 , tested for the faulty gene , but plan to when he is approaching five			0
' at the moment , i do n't think i could handle it , ' @entity15 says			2

@entity15 was devastated when she learned her son had inherited a disease
@entity55 is a genetic condition that results in blindness
@entity15 decided to help raise money to fund research for a cure
the mother - of - three raised a staggering £ 300,000
as a result , the world 's first treatment for the disease has been developed
