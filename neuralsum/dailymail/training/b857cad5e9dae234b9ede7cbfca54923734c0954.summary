should @entity0 require any inspiration for his @entity3 players ahead of a match with @entity5 that they must win well to stand a chance of claiming the title , a dvd of the sides ’ meeting in september 1989 would be a good idea			1
not only did @entity3 win 9 - 0 , they went on to lift the title – their last to date			1
the same scoreline at @entity15 would wipe out @entity17 ’s advantage on goal difference and place pressure on their rivals ahead of @entity22 ’s trip to the @entity23 on wednesday			1
with @entity25 ’s side well - drilled that remains a remote possibility but memories of that match offer @entity3 , who have five times score five or more in a @entity33 game this season , an opportunity to hope			1
yet later in the 1989/90 season it was @entity5 who stopped @entity3 when it really mattered			1
@entity39 rose to head an extra-time winner in the @entity42 semi-final to deny @entity3 an unprecedented double			1
one - up : @entity45 put @entity3 ahead against @entity5 in the 1990 @entity42 semi-final response : @entity48 ( third from right ) watches on as @entity51 equalises for @entity5 @entity52 : @entity5 celebrate @entity51 's goal , as they showed huge resolve against the team that had thrashed them 9 - 0 with such omens offering some food for thought , it remains to be seen which @entity3 will turn up tonight ; the team that has brushed aside many others this year , or the one which stalled against a resolute @entity65 ? in the 1989/90 season @entity5 were freshly promoted and came unstuck at @entity67 as eight different players found the net – the only time this has happened in the top - flight of @entity73 football			1
@entity74 opened and closed the scoring , with @entity76 , @entity45 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81 notching in between			2
to add to @entity5 's misery , @entity82 missed a penalty			1
@entity5 did stay up , mind			2
doubling up : @entity86 fired @entity5 into a 2 - 1 lead from close range at @entity89 final flourish : @entity39 ( number 11 ) headed home a 109th - minute winner to send @entity5 to @entity94 mobbed : @entity39 's winner sent the @entity5 fans , and his team - mates , into delerium then and now : @entity39 celebrates his winner in 1990 ( left ) but is under pressure as @entity101 manager now but seven months later @entity5 had their revenge			1
despite entering the match as huge underdogs and twice going behind , @entity105 ’s team triumphed			2
@entity45 opened the scoring early before @entity51 and @entity109 put @entity5 ahead			2
@entity76 equalised and when @entity80 converted a penalty in the 83rd minute in seemed @entity3 were set for @entity94			0
but @entity111 levelled again with two minutes left and @entity39 won it in the 109th minute of an epic match			2
@entity5 starting @entity114 v @entity3 , @entity89 , april 8 1990			1
lives near @entity117 and largely retired			0
assistant coach to manager @entity121 at @entity122			0
briefly @entity125 caretaker manager in 2012 but now out of work			0
@entity128 head coach in 2006 but not now involved in first class football			0
@entity33 commentator for @entity131 and pundit for @entity133 , @entity134			0
sacked as manager by @entity137 in march			0
after spells coaching is now a gardener in south - east @entity73			2
committed to raising funds for his foundation for cancer research			0
sports pundit on @entity146 , @entity147 and @entity148			0
a matchday correspondent on @entity131			0
@entity152 manager under increasing pressure from supporters .			0

in 1989/90 season reds thrashed @entity5 9 - 0 - the same score that would wipe out @entity17 's goal difference advantage tonight
however @entity160 came unstuck in @entity42 semi-final against the same team
@entity39 's extra-time winner saw @entity5 triumph 4 - 3 at @entity89
