a 19 - year - old medical student has died while undergoing liposuction - a prize for winning her local beauty competition			1
@entity4 , a part - time glamour model , was crowned winner of the @entity8 beauty contest , in @entity9			2
miss @entity4 , who won the competition in october last year , was showered with prizes , including a new @entity13 car 2015 , a smart tablet - and a free course of cosmetic surgery treatment			2
she told local media she had decided to exercise to lose the supposed excess weight instead			1
but it seems others were keen for her to undergo the surgery			0
her brother @entity46 , 24 , told local media : ' before having the surgery , she received a lot of calls from the surgeon trying to persuade her to do it , but she kept saying no. ' she was thinking about letting someone else have it as a freebie but eventually she agreed to have it just get him off her back			1
' according to @entity9 newspaper @entity59 , she eventually underwent the procedure at a private clinic on january 10 - with tragic consequences			1
but instead the teenage beauty queen died on the operating table , after allegedly being pressured into undergoing liposuction exactly how and why @entity66 ( left ) died remains unclear , with further examinations ordered to ascertain cause of death mourners at @entity66 's funeral , which was held just months after she was named winner of the beauty contest the surgeon who carried out the operation has now been arrested to prevent him leaving the country lawyer @entity78 said : ' i was told she had died of a brain oedema			1
' but the clinic staff told her relatives that she had died of a cardiac arrest			1
' i have ordered cytological and pathological examinations to find out what exactly happened			0
' however , it can be presumed as negligence because there has been no support from doctors who have failed to explain anything about the case			0
' the doctors in question have been arrested to prevent them from leaving the county			2
' the tragic death follows that of @entity102 model @entity101 , 27 , who also died during liposuction surgery in 2011			0
the cause of her death was registered as hypovolemic shock , where severe blood loss makes the heart unable to pump enough blood to the body			0
the perils of cosmetic surgery have also been in the headlines more recently , with @entity115 , 27 , runner - up in the 2012 miss @entity118 competition , ending up in intensive care after her surgery wounds became infected			0
miss @entity123 runner - up @entity115 ended up in intensive care after cosmetic surgery went wrong @entity127 - @entity126			0
