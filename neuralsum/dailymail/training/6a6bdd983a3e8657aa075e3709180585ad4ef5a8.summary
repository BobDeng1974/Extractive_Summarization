the @entity12 400 - metre hurdler tested positive in july last year for a prohibited substance contained in a contaminated supplement and was subsequently issued with a ban , the length of which was not made public			1
@entity2 competing in the men 's 400m heats of the 2013 @entity19 @entity18 in 2013 however , his legal team have successfully argued that although the positive test came before the introduction of the new @entity23 on january 1 this year , @entity2 should be able to take advantage of new powers of discretion given to tribunals in cases where there is no significant fault or negligence on the part of the athlete			2
@entity34 , a partner at @entity35 who represented @entity2 , said in a statement : ' the decision handed down by the tribunal is significant in that it is an early application of the 2015 @entity23 sanctions to a case under the previous rules , and because it is likely to be a benchmark for future contaminated supplement cases			2
' in applying the sanctions under the 2015 code the tribunal elected to suspend @entity2 for only four months which means that @entity2 is able to return to competition with immediate effect			0
' @entity2 can now return to action after having his ban reduced to four months the @entity52 reported that another @entity12 and @entity3 athlete , 800m runner @entity53 , has also had his ban reduced to six months having failed a test in june			1
@entity53 's case also involved the same contaminated supplement , an energy drink which was found to contain anabolic steroid metabolites			0
' the hardest six months of my life , being stopped doing the thing i love , ' @entity53 told the @entity52 of his ban			0
' but the rules are in place to catch people who are cheating			0
