evidence : police officer @entity1 today admitted that he was not qualified to oversee the @entity2 semi-final in april 1989 which ended in tragedy the most senior police officer on duty during the @entity9 disaster today apologised and admitted he was ' not the best man ' for the task , adding that he was ' learning on the job '			1
former chief superintendent @entity1 , the match commander , had little experience of policing football matches and had never been in charge during a game before			1
giving evidence at the inquest into the deaths of 96 @entity21 fans today , he said it was a ' serious mistake ' not to consult with his predecessor about the challenges the match would pose , and apologised for ' failings ' in the policing of the game			1
the supporters were crushed to death shortly after the start of the @entity2 semi-final between @entity21 and @entity33 at @entity35 's @entity9 ground on april 15 , 1989			1
mr @entity1 , now 70 , was a chief superintendent who was promoted to be head of the local police division two weeks before the game			1
he gave the order to open the gates to the ground in the minutes before the crush , allowing 2,000 fans to flood into the ground , and later wrongly claimed that a gate had been forced open			1
speaking at the inquest in @entity47 , @entity48 today , mr @entity1 was asked whether he had any concerns about his ability to do the job properly given his lack of experience			1
the former officer replied : ' all i would say is this , that after a period , i would say , i 'm older , hopefully wiser - probably i was not the best man for the job on the day			0
' mr @entity1 said he had no recent previous experience of policing at @entity9 before the match and his knowledge of the stadium was ' very general			1
' asked later how familiar he was with the ground , mr @entity1 said : ' with hindsight i can almost say , knowing the events of the day , i should 've spent the majority of my time as the new commander down there			1
' i did in the light of the information available what i considered necessary , and , if there was a failing , well , i apologise			2
' the officer agreed that while he had experience of public order policing , that was ' totally different ' to policing football matches			1
he added : ' at the time i should have thought about my limited knowledge of the role of a commander at a major event that was a sell - out when i had not been in that responsible position previously			0
' mr @entity1 said that after first joining @entity86 as a cadet in 1960 , he had been ' delighted ' to be promoted to the post of chief superintendent of @entity90 of @entity86 - including @entity9 - around march 1989			1
inexperienced : mr @entity1 had only recently been promoted at the time of the match relatives : campaigners @entity95 , left , and @entity96 , right , pictured outside the inquest today the witness told the jury the job came with other major responsibilities , as the area was also home to a major hospital , the local university and areas of affluence and deprivation			1
he said , while the semi-final game was ' obviously a major priority ' , it was only one of the priorities he had to deal with , adding : ' i only had 15 days , and that was not 15 working days			2
' mr @entity1 said his understanding of the job of the match commander was that he would not be involved in the day - to - day or minute - by - minute duties and would only become on the day if something went wrong			1
@entity121 asked him : ' did it not occur to you before the match that it was a job that called for deep experience ? ' mr @entity1 said he had been ' assured ' by his boss the chief constable he could rely on the other experienced officers in his team , though he had only had a single brief conversation with his predecessor , @entity130			1
miss @entity131 asked if he thought it was a mistake to accept the role and ' not seek the assistance from others such as mr @entity130 ? ' he replied : ' there was a culture in the police service at that time and the culture was you would be moved without any overlap and you would learn , dare i say it , on the job			0
so it did not cross my mind to say , ' i 'm not up to the job			0
' i just got on with it			0
' miss @entity131 continued : ' my question is , in hindsight , was it a mistake ? ' the witness replied : ' in hindsight , it was a serious mistake			0
i did know what the job involved , but no one , including me , knew what might evolve on the day			0
' crush : 96 @entity21 fans were killed by being pressed up against the ground 's perimeter fence mr @entity1 said that it was necessary to keep rival fans apart from each other in order to ensure their safety , pointing to the culture of football hooliganism at the time			1
he said : ' the main objectives were safety and i align that with segregation , because if segregation was ensured , then safety usually followed , because of your planning			0
you ca n't separate the two			0
' mr @entity1 said he had experienced hooliganism while working as a inspector at @entity182 's @entity181 ground , adding : ' it was a feature of matches in those days where people fought and argued for whatever reason			1
' those were the challenges that we were facing in the 1970s			0
it seemed to be very sadly the fact of life that fighting and hooliganism was the main feature of policing football matches			1
' miss @entity131 asked him about two pre-match meetings of police officers , dealing with planning ahead of the game			0
mr @entity1 said the first , on march 22 , 1989 , was chaired by his predecessor and he ' just sat there and listened '			1
he insisted that no minutes were taken of the meeting , and he was not given any notes after the event			0
chaos : fans flooded onto the pitch in the aftermath of the disaster jurors also heard mr @entity1 intended to have a day - long ' one - to - one ' briefing with mr @entity130 before he took over from him as match commander for the 1989 semi-final			1
that meeting did not happen as he expected , said mr @entity1 , who had heard ' speculation and rumour ' that mr @entity130 was moved to another post after ' matters of indiscipline ' within his division			2
he added : ' i went to see mr @entity130 , expecting to have a whole day with him , and he seemed , shall we say , in my view , disappointed to be moving , wanting to clear his desk , jealously guarding his relationship with @entity35 , and offered me little or no advice			0
' mr @entity1 told the jury he had not recognised the risk of over-crowding created by the existence of pens on the @entity236 terracing			2
' i gave no thought to it either way , ' he said			0
' it was n't something that came to mind			0
there was no evidence to suggest from previous events that i should have considered it			0
' mr @entity1 said he had not realised before the disaster that the lay - out of the @entity236 end ' formed something of a bottle - neck '			2
asked who he thought was responsible for monitoring pens to prevent overcrowding , he said that both officers stationed around the stadium and stewards had a role to play			0
when miss @entity131 pointed out that the official plan for the game did not ascribe this duty to police , mr @entity1 said : ' in a perfect world i would have given certain officers a specific role in that order to do that			2
' he admitted that he had a responsibility to monitor overcrowding from the control box , but added : ' i did n't know the difference because of my inexperience of an overcrowded or full pen			0
' campaigners welcomed mr @entity1 's appearance at court today			2
@entity95 , chair of the @entity278 , told 5 news : ' it 's very , very important because all the families , for 26 years now , have been desperate for mr @entity1 to come into an inquest and to answer questions			2
' it was important to find out exactly what his role was and what he did on that day and why 96 people die ' , she said			0
@entity95 added : ' this is what we 'd been fighting for for all of these years to get the inquest verdicts quashed because we know they were wrong			0
' the hearing continues tomorrow , when mr @entity1 will continue giving evidence			2

@entity1 had been promoted two weeks before game in april 1989

admits he should have tried harder to get advice on how to handle game
apologises ' if there was a failing ' in the policing of the @entity9 match
@entity1 , 70 , ordered gates of the ground to be opened shortly before 96 @entity21 fans were crushed to death during @entity2 semi-final
