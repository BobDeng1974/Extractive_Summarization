@entity0 plied schoolgirls with alcohol before forcing himself on them a child rapist who plied schoolgirls with alcohol before forcing himself on them has been locked up for 12 years			2
@entity0 , 26 , described as immature for his age , had invited three 14 - year - olds to go to the party in @entity8 , @entity9 , but on the way there two of the teenagers got drunk on vodka and beer			1
judge @entity15 said the girls were completely ill - equipped to cope with the alcohol and @entity0 , who was 24 at the time , had given them drink with ' sinister intent '			1
he said : ' your conversation en route was clearly sexual , and sexualised , and you made no secret , as the girls told the court , that you fancied some of them			0
' @entity28 heard how both girls were obviously drunk but instead of letting one of them sleep on the sofa @entity0 walked her into a bedroom where he sexually abused her before leaving her curled up on the bed in a distressed state			1
judge @entity36 said @entity0 , of @entity28 , then took the other 14 - year - old girl upstairs and bit her on the breast in what he described as ' a disturbing act '			1
later that night @entity0 went back into the bedroom where he had left his first victim and subjected her to more abuse including twice raping her			1
the judge said @entity0 forced her to have full , unprotected sexual intercourse despite her verbal and physical protests			2
a jury found him guilty of two charges of rape , one of attempted rape , sexual activity with a child and he was also found guilty of assaulting the second girl by biting her breast			0
' your behaviour was wicked , nasty and callous , ' the judge told @entity0 on wednesday who put his head in hands as he was handed his 12 - year jail term			1
' i gain the impression mr @entity0 that at the time you thought you could do as you pleased having made those girls insensible ... and you thought that in acting in this way you could get away with it			2
' judge @entity36 highlighted the importance of the victim impact statement he had received from the rape victim following the publicity regarding judge @entity75 who had to apologise to the family of a murdered man in @entity79 after they overheard him say that victim impact statements made no difference when considering parole for his killers			1
@entity28 heard how @entity0 , 26 , plied the girls with alcohol before the attacks @entity88 and @entity89 , whose son @entity90 was stabbed to death on @entity79 13 years ago , say they overheard the judge commenting that the statements at such hearings did not make a difference			1
praising the schoolgirl â€™s statement as ' a very helpful document ' , @entity97 said : ' it has to be emphasised yet again how important victim impact material is , especially at the sentencing stage			2
victims are at the centre of these matters			0
' the damage is always incalculable			0
judge @entity36 highlighted the importance of the victim impact statement he had received ' she may never recover from that ordeal			1
' there has been an attack her on an extremely vulnerable child			0
' there was a degree of planning and intention			0
drugs were used in the sense of alcohol to facilitate the offence			0
you had taken those girls there			0
they had , as it were , entrusted their safety to you			0
' the judge accepted that @entity0 was somewhat immature but he said he was not a youth and knew what he was doing			2
as part of the sentence judge @entity36 imposed an indefinite sexual offences prevention order on @entity0 which bans him from having any contact with the complainants and he must also register as a sex offender with the police for the rest of his life			1
the judge said @entity0 would serve half of the 12 - year sentence but added he would then be subject to a rigorous licence supervision and conditions			1
after the case , detective constable @entity146 , of the @entity147 , said : ' @entity0 knew his victims were not of consenting age , yet forced himself upon them after plying them with alcohol			2
' this must have been very distressing for them and we would like to thank them for their courage in coming forward			0
' we hope the sentence which has been passed down today will help to give them some closure			0
' we also hope that it will encourage victims of sexual offences to come forward and report them to our specially trained officers , who will investigate every complaint , no matter how historic , with the aim of securing a conviction			0
