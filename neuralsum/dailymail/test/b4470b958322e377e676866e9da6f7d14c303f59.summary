the red planet might still have liquid water , suggests information collected by @entity4 's @entity3			1
researchers have long known that there is water in the form of ice on @entity10			1
now , new information from the @entity10 rover @entity3 , published in the journal nature , shows that it is possible that there is liquid water close to the surface of the red planet			1
the ‘ @entity18 ’ in @entity19 on @entity10			0
very fine - grained sediments , which slowly fell down through the water , were deposited right at the bottom of the crater lake			0
the sediment plates at the bottom are level , so everything indicates that the entire @entity19 may have been a large lake			0
new information from @entity4 's @entity3 , published in the journal nature , shows that it is possible that there is liquid water close to the surface of the red planet			1
the explanation is that the substance perchlorate has been found in the soil , which lowers the freezing point so the water does not freeze into ice , but is liquid and present in very salty water			1
curiosity detected salts called perchlorates , which can absorb water from the atmosphere and turn it into briny liquid			0
when night falls , some of the water vapour in the atmosphere condenses on the planet surface as frost , but calcium perchlorate is very absorbent and it forms a brine with the water , so the freezing point is lowered and the frost can turn into a liquid			1
@entity3 landed on @entity10 in 2012 in the large crater , @entity19 , located just south of the equator			0
the giant crater is 154 kilometres in diameter and the rim of the crater is almost five kilometres high			0
in the middle of the crater lies the mountain , @entity66			0
curiosity has travelled more than 10km from the landing site towards @entity66 and has carried out many studies along the way			0
doctor @entity71 , associate professor and head of the @entity73 at the @entity74 at the @entity75 in @entity76 , said : ' we have discovered the substance calcium perchlorate in the soil and , under the right conditions , it absorbs water vapour from the atmosphere			1
' our measurements from the @entity3 's weather monitoring station show that these conditions exist at night and just after sunrise in the winter			2
' based on measurements of humidity and the temperature at a height of 1.6 metres and at the surface of the planet , we can estimate the amount of water that is absorbed			2
' when night falls , some of the water vapour in the atmosphere condenses on the planet surface as frost , but calcium perchlorate is very absorbent and it forms a brine with the water , so the freezing point is lowered and the frost can turn into a liquid			1
researchers say that @entity19 was once a giant lake on the red planet ' the soil is porous , so what we are seeing is that the water seeps down through the soil			1
' over time , other salts may also dissolve in the soil and now that they are liquid , they can move and precipitate elsewhere under the surface			2
' observations by the @entity10 probe 's stereo camera have previously shown areas characteristic of old riverbed with rounded pepples that clearly show that a long time ago there was flowing , running water with a depth of up to one metre			1
now the new close - up images taken by the rover all the way en route to @entity66 show that there are expanses of sedimentary deposits , lying as ' plates ' one above the other and leaning a bit toward @entity66			0
evidence of water on @entity10 dates back to the @entity139 mission , which arrived in 1971			2
it revealed clues of water erosion in river beds and canyons as well as weather fronts and fogs			0
@entity148 orbiters that followed caused a revolution in our ideas about water on @entity10 by showing how floods broke through dams and carved deep valleys			0
@entity10 is currently in the middle of an ice age , and before this study , scientists believed liquid water could not exist on its surface			1
in june 2013 , @entity3 found powerful evidence that water good enough to drink once flowed on @entity10			2
in september of the same year , the first scoop of soil analysed by @entity3 revealed that fine materials on the surface of the planet contain two per cent water by weight			2
last month , scientists provided the best estimates for water on @entity10 , claiming it once had more liquid @entity174 ) than the @entity175 - and the planet kept these oceans for more than 1.5 billion years			1
the findings suggest there was ample time and water for life on @entity10 to thrive , but over the last 3.7 billion years the red planet has lost 87 per cent of its water - leaving it barren and dry			1
dr @entity71 said : ' these kind of deposits are formed when large amounts of water flow down the slopes of the crater and these streams of water meet the stagnant water in the form of a lake			0
' however , he added that it is not likely that life will be found on @entity10 as it is too dry , too cold and the cosmic radiation is so powerful that it penetrates at least one metre into the surface and kills all life - at least life as we know it on @entity203			1
the finding , however , could make it easier for humans to live on @entity10 in the future			1
he explains that about 4.5 billion years ago , @entity10 had 6.5 times as much water as it does now and a thicker atmosphere			0
but most of this water has disappeared out into space and the reason is that @entity10 no longer has global magnetic fields , which we have on @entity203			0
observations by the @entity10 probe 's stereo camera have previously shown areas characteristic of old riverbed with rounded pepples that clearly show that a long time ago there was flowing , running water with a depth of up to one metre			2
currents of liquid iron in the @entity203 ’s interior generate the magnetic fields and they act as a shield that protects us from cosmic radiation			0
the magnetic field protects the @entity203 ’s atmosphere against degradation from energy rich particles from the sun. but @entity10 no longer has a global magnetic field and this means that the atmosphere is not protected from radiation from the sun , so the solar particles ( protons ) simply ‘ shoot ’ the atmosphere out into space little by little .			0

possible that there is liquid water close to the surface of the red planet
substance perchlorate has been found in the soil , which lowers the freezing point so the water does not freeze into ice , but is liquid
life as we know it is ' not likely ' to exist *due* to planet 's harsh conditions
finding could make it easier for humans to live on @entity10 in the future .
