damaging : intelligence chiefs have lost track of some of @entity4 ’s most dangerous criminals after @entity6 @entity5 revealed their tactics intelligence chiefs have lost track of some of @entity4 ’s most dangerous criminals because @entity6 fugitive @entity5 exposed security service operations , it has been claimed			1
the @entity4 ’s eavesdropping service , @entity13 , has had to stop monitoring drug gangs , paedophiles , human traffickers and money launderers as a result of the ‘ significant ’ damage inflicted by the leaks reported in the @entity22 newspaper , sources said			1
the left - wing paper published a series of articles giving details of the activities of @entity6 and @entity4 spy agencies , based on the top - secret files stolen by @entity5			1
the reports helped to blow a massive hole in @entity4 ’s intelligence - gathering capability by exposing sensitive methods to terrorists			1
security chiefs said that extremists were ‘ lapping up ’ the articles and using them to evade detection			0
now , intelligence sources have warned that more than a quarter of the activities of some of the @entity4 ’s most prolific crime bosses are going undetected because they have changed their communications following the revelations			1
in other cases , @entity13 has toned down or abandoned surveillance amid fears that the tactics are too easy to spot and could force criminals to ‘ go dark ’ and fall off the radar completely			1
one senior security official told @entity53 : ‘ @entity5 has been very damaging to our work			2
we have specific evidence of where key targets have changed their communication behaviour as a direct result of what they have read			0
they have moved to more secure forms of communication and we have been unable to assist the @entity66			0
’ while spy bosses had already told how terrorists changed their tactics after the leaks last year , the latest revelations show that harm was also done to @entity13 ’s other remit – combating serious and organised crime			1
among the gangs left able to operate unhindered , the source said , was a drug - smuggling ring which had continued to bring @entity79 narcotics into @entity4			2
@entity5 , 31 , became one of the world ’s most wanted men in june last year – less than a month after @entity84 ’s murder – when he broke cover as the civilian @entity87 worker who stole classified files from the @entity89			0
he leaked information about attempts by spy agencies – including @entity13 and the @entity89 – to view citizens ’ private data such as internet history , emails , texts , calls and passwords			0
giving evidence at @entity102 last year , sir @entity100 , then head of @entity13 , said the ‘ fragile mosaic ’ of capabilities that allowed intelligence agents to discover , investigate and take action against terrorists , paedophiles and other serious criminals had become ‘ far , far weaker ’ because of the revelations			1
@entity111 , the @entity112 , said the leaks had had a ‘ serious effect on intelligence - gathering – that is unquestionable			0
’ and in june @entity118 , the home secretary , said that the government ’s ability to tackle organised crime was being hampered by a decline in the ability of police and intelligence services to access communications data used by alleged terrorists and criminals			0
impact : @entity13 , the government ’s communications surveillance service , has stopped monitoring dangerous criminals after its ability to keep tabs on them was damaged by the leaks			1
above , @entity13 headquarters consequently , mrs may has announced expanded powers that will allow the police and intelligence services to spy on the internet			2
the proposed legislation would require internet companies to keep records of every website their customers visited			0
@entity5 , who was a computer specialist at an intelligence centre in @entity150 , tricked colleagues into giving him passwords so he could copy up to 1.7million files in one of the biggest leaks in @entity6 history			2
the defence contractor claims he had to act because the @entity6 government ’s policies were a ‘ threat to democracy ’			0
he fled to @entity162 , then @entity163 , where he was granted asylum and now lives in a secret location			0
organised crime is thought to involve up to 5,500 gangs and costs the @entity4 £ 24billion a year .			2
