@entity0 : she took a controversial shortcut on last night 's @entity2 @entity2 contestants are supposed to pride themselves on home - spun skills and recipes handed down the generations			1
now one of them has ditched tradition – in favour of the microwave			0
judges @entity14 and @entity15 were visibly shocked when grandmother @entity0 , 60 , popped her dough in for a five - minute blitz at ten per cent power			1
the idea behind mrs @entity0 ’s shortcut was to help the enriched sweet dough for her @entity23 plum bread rise faster , thereby stealing a march on her fellow competitors			1
but baking experts also expressed dismay at the trick , saying microwaves have no place in any self - respecting baker ’s kitchen			2
contestants on last night ’s quarter - final were given only two - and - a - half hours to produce a perfect loaf , which mrs @entity0 ’s rivals complained was barely enough time to prove and cook their dough			1
on hearing about the mircrowave quick - fix , miss @entity14 turned indignantly to her fellow judge and said : ‘ you never use a microwave do you ? ’ @entity44 said he did not , adding : ‘ it destroys the protein structure , because you force in heat			1
it tends to break down , so it can destabilise the dough			2
’ baking experts also criticised mrs @entity0			1
@entity51 , executive director of the @entity52 , said : ‘ all it will have done is cook the dough while it is rising , instead of allowing it to rise at its own pace			2
you ca n’t rush these things			0
i never thought i ’d see a microwave on @entity2			0
’ mrs @entity0 , from @entity60 in @entity23 , admitted she was ‘ a bit scared ’ that her plan would backfire			2
she added : ‘ this could be my death knell			0
it should be all right			0
it ’s been all right when i ’ve tried it			0
’ thanks to the extra heat provided by the microwave , her dough rose to an impressive size			2
however , @entity44 was unconvinced			0
‘ what you ’ve got is something that is under - proved , or the proteins have indeed been damaged and then it rips and falls , ’ he said , adding : ‘ it ’s got a good structure			0
i think it ’s slightly underdone			0
’ he said mrs @entity0 should have made her dough longer and thinner instead , to allow it to rise of its own accord			1
miss @entity14 was more positive , saying she thought the fruity loaf was ‘ absolutely scrumptious ’			1
yesterday ’s star baker was builder @entity86 , 38 , the fourth time he has scooped the accolade , while 17 - year - old @entity89 , the show ’s youngest - ever contestant , was eliminated			0
no time to spare : mrs @entity0 ( left ) puts the dough in for a zap as hot @entity93 ( right ) looks on judges @entity15 ( left ) and @entity14 ( right ) were left visibly shocked at the microwave shortcut			1
