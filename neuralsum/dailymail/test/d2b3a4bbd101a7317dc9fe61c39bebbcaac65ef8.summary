health bosses are considering raising the legal age for buying alcohol to 21 to tackle binge drinking			1
the proposal has been put forward by experts at @entity6 , the @entity7 ’s health promotions agency , which says more action is needed to tackle the ‘ continuing problem ’ of ‘ hazardous alcohol consumption in young people ’			1
the move would apply in pubs , clubs , supermarkets and off - licences in @entity17			1
new measure : health bosses are considering raising the legal age for buying alcohol to 21 to tackle binge drinking if introduced it would mean the legal minimum age for buying alcohol would be higher in @entity17 than it is in the rest of @entity27 , where it is 18			2
last night professor sir @entity29 , chairman of @entity30 , said he would welcome the minimum age being set at 21			0
he said : ‘ if it was 21 now , i would not be calling for it to be lowered			0
’ but he added : ‘ given the fact that we are where we are , i think that politically it is quite difficult , when the age is 18 for so many other adult rites in our society			0
’ the proposal to raise the legal age is outlined in a report titled ‘ @entity45 for @entity17 – what the @entity46 and experts say ’ , which examines mea - sures to improve public health			2
it says the idea to ‘ increase the minimum legal drinking age to 21 would be highly cost - effective , as it would both improve people ’s health without having to spend much money , and reduce demand on the @entity6 ’			1
report author @entity59 said : ‘ in @entity17 , hazardous alcohol consumption in young people is a continuing problem			1
‘ for both males and females , the largest increase in hospitalisation rates for alcohol - related conditions since the early 1980s has been in the 15 - 24 year olds , and this was particularly marked for females			2
’ in fact , doctors across the whole of @entity27 are worried about the increase in such hospitalisations			0
between 2002 and 2010 , the number of admissions to @entity79 hospitals among 15 to 24 year olds due to alcohol rose by 66 per cent to 55,655 – or more than 150 a day			0
the proposal has been put forward by experts at @entity6 , the @entity7 ’s health promotions agency the increase among women ( 76 per cent ) was higher than in men ( 57 per cent )			1
while the government in @entity87 has been reluctant to legislate to tackle the alcohol problem , the @entity7 has had far fewer reservations			1
it has already agreed a 50p minimum unit price for alcohol , although the controversial move will not be implemented if the @entity93 succeeds in an ongoing court battle to block it			2
the @entity7 has also banned ‘ @entity99 ’ ( buy - one - get - one - free ) deals and other offers encouraging bulk - buying of alcohol , and reduced the drink driving limit			0
a @entity7 spokesman said : ‘ we remain open to the consideration of any evidence - based proposals that can contribute to reducing alcohol - related harm			0
’ a @entity107 spokesman in @entity108 said : ‘ there are no plans to increase the legal age for buying alcohol			0
