by @entity0 published : 17:52 est , 17 april 2013 updated : 05:45 est , 18 april 2013 some 48 years , two months , 16 days and – if you look very closely at the clocks – just a few minutes separate these images of the two solemn events			0
but , apart from a few radical additions to the @entity8 ’s skyline , it is almost as if time has stood still			1
you can not help but be struck by the remarkable similarities between the two scenes			0
yesterday , soldiers and public lined the same historic street to pay their respects to @entity25 as she was laid to rest one shows the funeral cortege of sir @entity19 on january 30 , 1965			1
the other shows @entity25 ’s funeral cortege yesterday			2
both events were photographed from the same position , looking down as the processions passed along @entity17 on the way to @entity20 ’s			2
on both occasions , crowds lined the streets in their masses to pay their last respects as the @entity40 - draped coffins passed by on gun carriages and the military featured heavily with similar pomp			0
sir @entity19 ’s was a full state funeral , whereas @entity25 ’s yesterday was a ceremonial occasion			1
but in practice there are few real differences between the two , except that a state funeral has to be approved by a vote in @entity52 and with a state funeral the deceased would normally be expected to lie in state for three days in @entity56 to allow members of the public to pay their respects			0
a total of 321,360 people filed past the catafalque while sir @entity19 was lying in state			2
sombre : the @entity64 at @entity19 's funeral , left , and striking a similar pose yesterday , right it was in a piece about the lying - in - state of sir @entity19 that the @entity70 ’s @entity69 famously wrote : ‘ two rivers run silently through @entity8 tonight , and one is made of people			1
@entity75 and quiet as the night - time @entity76 itself , it flows through @entity56 , eddying about the foot of the rock called @entity19			2
’ silent crowds watched as @entity19 ’s coffin left @entity56 as @entity83 struck 9.45am and started its journey through @entity8 , the skyline then dominated by the dome of @entity20 ’s and free from skyscrapers			1
it was only 38 years later , in 2003 , that the @entity88 was completed on the former site of the @entity90			0
towering between it and @entity20 ’s now is also the @entity92 , which will be 737ft when completed			0
another notable change in the scene today is the removal of the railway bridge over @entity97			0
standing tall : @entity19 's gun carriage goes past the @entity99 in 1965 , left , and , right , @entity25 's hearse takes the same route yesterday by decree of the @entity64 , sir @entity19 's body lay in @entity104 in @entity56 for three days and a state funeral service was held at @entity20 in 1965 the echoes of @entity19 's funeral were felt throughout the day as @entity25 was laid to rest at sir @entity19 ’s funeral the mourners were led by his wife , @entity111 , his son @entity112 and daughters @entity114 and lady @entity115			1
the @entity64 and the @entity116 attended , as did the @entity117 and the then teenage prince @entity118			0
together with the then prime minister , @entity121 , and representatives of 112 countries they packed into the cathedral for the service			0
the @entity64 struck an almost identical pose to the one she adopted yesterday , with her handbag hooked over her left arm and her hands clutched in front of her , as she contemplated the loss of sir @entity19 , the first of the 12 prime ministers to have served during her reign			2
whereas @entity25 was cremated after her funeral service , sir @entity19 was laid to rest in the @entity137 parish churchyard of @entity138 , close to @entity139 where he was born 90 years before , with only family members present			1
two great leaders : @entity19 and @entity25 in their prime as @entity144 prime ministers sir @entity19 's coffin leaves @entity20 following his funeral service in 1965 @entity25 's coffin leaves @entity20 yesterday			1
