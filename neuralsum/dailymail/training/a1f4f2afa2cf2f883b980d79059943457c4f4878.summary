by @entity0 these eerie images show the interior of a former courthouse which has remained almost untouched since it was abandoned nearly two decades ago			1
the @entity4 in @entity5 hosted the city 's crown court for 100 years , but now the @entity9 - listed building in danger of demolition			1
photographer @entity12 captured the atmospheric pictures , which show how the benches and docks in each courtroom are still in place			0
abandoned : the @entity4 in @entity5 was formerly used as the city 's crown court but is now entirely unused inside : a courtroom inside the building , where the benches and docks are still intact two decades later cells : the paint is peeling off the tiles on the walls and ceiling of the police cells located in the basement of the court overhead : the courtroom looks as if it has only just been vacated despite being unused since 1997 there are also objects formerly used by those who worked inside , such as telephones and legal documents - while the cells below the court can also be visited			1
' it 's such a rare sight to see and roam free in somewhere like this , ' said mr @entity12 , 28 , from @entity41			2
' the cells felt very oppressive , i sat in one with the door closed for a good ten minutes , just thinking if i had been locked away for real			0
' the courtrooms had a smell of damp in the air and had a very theatrical atmosphere			0
left behind : a crumbling law book used by barristers and judges was found inside the building @entity52 : a landline phone remains in place inside the @entity4 , while crown insignia hints at its former use staircase : the @entity9 - listed building is unoccupied and in danger of destruction despite campaigns to save it office : the door into the room provided for solicitors during the building 's time as the crown court ' although there was n't a lot inside , there were some legal reference books and keys for the cell doors			1
' i bet all the prisoners that had been locked away wished they could have got their hands on them at the time			0
' he took the photographs after being allowed in by builders working on the site			0
the @entity4 was built in 1808 , and it was turned into the crown court after a replacement hall was built at the end of the century			1
haunting : photographer @entity12 described the cells as ' oppressive ' and said they depicted the atmosphere of the time locked away : those appearing in court would be kept in these cells in between their hearings untouched : the cells still have their original beds installed , although paint is flaking off nearly every surface in the building surveillance : the doors of the cells were fitted with peepholes to allow warders to see inside it played host to a number of notable cases - including the murder trial of @entity108 , who shot dead his pregnant mistress in 1986 before fleeing to @entity110 and trying to throw himself off a cathedral			1
however , in 1997 the city opened a new court building , and the hall was sold off and left to crumble			2
local campaigners have long called for the hall to be filled once again so that @entity5 can make the best use of its historic heritage			2
in 2007 , the @entity119 named it one of the most endangered 19th - century buildings in the @entity122			0
entrance : the @entity4 was built in 1808 and the interiors boast a neo-classical design with columns and pediments fears : campaigners are concerned that the building has been allowed to follow into disrepair despite its historic and architectural importance fireplace : some rooms show clear signs of their neglect and now look like a building site layout : this photograph shows the lawyers ' benches as well as the jury box , located on the right of the image ' i want to bring this place to the attention of the masses in hope that they will make good use of the building , ' mr @entity12 said			1
' instead of staying empty this place could be used for tv shows , or made into a museum , restaurant or art gallery			0
' it 's such an important part of @entity5 's history that i feel it is just wasted sat there like this			1
' these photographs of the courts and cells create a big reaction from the public , with most people say i 'm lucky to have seen such a place without actually getting into trouble			0
' misbehaving ? the location of this cigarette makes it look as if a barrister was smoking in the courtroom modern : another courtroom looks as if it could still be in use today carving : the insignia of the crown is included in the wooden pediments over the building 's doors case : the @entity183 's report of @entity108 's murder trial , which took place at @entity186 in 1987			2
