unhappy union : they differ little on policy , but their battle threatens to lead to an early election and a defeat for its economic reform agenda @entity1 's supporters have called on @entity3 to hold a leadership ballot , believing only he can stem haemorrhaging voter support , but a move back to @entity1 risks losing the backing of independents who give the minority @entity11 government a one - seat majority			1
' if they go down this stream it is a very high risk strategy and it would more than likely lead to an early election , ' said @entity77 , one of the independents			0
@entity1 told a news conference in @entity15 he would return to @entity2 this week before deciding his future , but ended his announcement asking his ruling @entity11 colleagues ' who is best placed to defeat ( opposition leader ) @entity82 at the next election ? '			2
