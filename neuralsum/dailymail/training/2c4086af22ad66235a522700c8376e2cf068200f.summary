the @entity17 station guard admits he can not hold a tune like the famous singer , who performed to sell - out audiences across the globe			1
some even hop off their train to be photographed with him before jumping back on before it leaves			2

he travelled the world for a decade as a lookalike , earning up to £ 300 a time for appearances in locations as far afield as @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49			1
dead ringer : @entity11 , left , looks just like the late singer , right , and passengers queue to have their pictures taken with him but the work dried up after the singer died in 2007 , and mr @entity11 was forced to get a new job at @entity58 station in @entity59			1
mr @entity11 , who is known as ' @entity60 ' by colleagues and commuters , said : ' it ’s a talking point for sure			2

' i ’ve had trains come in slowing down and i ’ve had people get off to take my picture before jumping back on the train			2
' we have impromptu little songs			0
i ask them if they know @entity13 , they hum it and i sing it			2
' i ca n’t sing like @entity10 - but i give it a good go			0
all the punters love it			0
grand arrival : the former greengrocer started impersonating the @entity10 after the 1990 football @entity35 , when the opera star 's recording of @entity13 was used by the @entity41 ' they know the railways do n’t always run on time but people know i will be out there to keep them smiling			2

' he just bursts into song and everybody gives him a little clap			0
' it ’s a good way to start your day - especially on a monday morning when you do n’t really want to go to work			0
' double take : mr @entity11 , who used to be a greengrocer , met his illustrious lookalike at @entity103 in @entity104 busy schedule : mr @entity11 impersonated the singer in adverts , including this one for mineral water in @entity109 recognise us ? mr @entity11 ( right ) takes his place in lookalike group @entity112 with colleagues @entity113 , who plays @entity115 ( left ) , and @entity116 ( centre ) , who plays @entity118 mr @entity11 ’s lookalike career took off when his wife @entity120 , 58 , sent a photograph to an agent			1
