‘ only because she was so young and fit did she get to the point of delivering the baby			0

following the birth of her daughter , mrs @entity7 also had a stem cell transplant			1
recording a narrative verdict , a coroner said the new mother died of myocarditis - a heart condition caused by the drugs used in her treatment ' clearly it is very tragic that the stem cell transplant could not provide a longer remission for her			1
‘ it is also right to say she was a very engaged and intelligent young woman who liked to explore all the information she could obtain to take care of her health			0
’ the family are now raising money for more research into the illness			0
they declined to comment after the hearing , but mother @entity165 said on a just giving online page : ‘ @entity7 ’s determination to find a way to fight this horrible disease by natural methods was inspirational			2
her end goal was to survive and have a family			0
that was all she wanted			0
mrs @entity7 's family paid tribute to the ' inspirational ' woman - saying they we ' so proud ' of her			1
they are now raising money to raise awareness and fund research in to the rare form of cancer ‘ she was a very well - informed and intelligent young woman and her journey led her on to an holistic route that worked for her for four years			0
