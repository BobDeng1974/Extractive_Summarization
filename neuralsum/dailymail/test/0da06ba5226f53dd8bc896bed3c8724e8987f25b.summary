@entity0 famously poked fun at @entity2 when it emerged its @entity3 could bend out of shape in people 's pockets			1
but now the @entity8 firm is facing a ' bendgate ' controversy of its own after a video emerged claiming to show a similar flaw on the @entity12			1
the company has now responded with its own video , demonstrating a three - point bend test on both its @entity12 models			2
the video was released by third - party warranty firm @entity21 , and has since been criticised by @entity0 ' we are confident that all our smartphones are not bendable under daily usage , ' the company said in a statement			1
the comments and video were posted in response to findings from third - party warranty firm @entity21 , which publicised that the @entity12 can bend and shatter under 110lbs ( 50kg ) of pressure			1
it also tested the @entity35 m9 both deformed and broke at 120lbs ( 54kg )			0
' @entity36 may be good in the yoga studio , but it is not what you want in a mobile device , ' said @entity42 , vice president of global communications for @entity21			2
' last fall 's @entity44 caught many by surprise , but as manufacturers strive for larger screens on thinner devices , they can be more susceptible to bending or snapping			0
' @entity52 ' tests reveal that while the @entity3 bends , the @entity12 edge cracks under pressure			0
@entity0 claims the tests conducted by @entity21 was unfair as 110lbs ( 50kg ) of pressure ' rarely occurs under normal circumstances			1
' ' the video assumes a very specific condition - 110lbf ( 50kgf ) , ' the company said			0
the teardown shows , from the front , the screen , logic board holder , battery , logic board with processor , camera , rear case and antenna			0
it is a fascinating view of exactly what goes into a modern smartphone - and how @entity0 does business			2
the @entity75 site has posted this amazing image revealing the internals of the firm 's @entity12 , which goes on sale on april 10th			0
the internals reveal @entity0 used more of its own chips to power the new @entity12 smartphone than it did for the predecessor @entity84 , according to an early teardown report , in a blow to @entity88 chip supplier @entity87			2
@entity0 is not only using its own @entity93 mobile processor , as had been widely reported , but also decided to rely on its in - house semiconductor business to source other parts , including the modem and power management integrated circuit chips , @entity91 - based consultancy @entity89 said			2
@entity0 is counting on its new flagship @entity12 and @entity100 edge phones to help revive earnings momentum after a disappointing 2014			0
strong sales of system chips such as its @entity93 processor could also help boost earnings , analysts and investors say			0
the @entity12 also comes with @entity0 's @entity111 modem chip , @entity88 phone @entity108 said on its website			1
' the normal force that generated when a person presses the back pocket is approximately 66lbf ( 30kgf )			0
' our internal test results indicate that the @entity100 and @entity119 edge are not bendable even under 79lbf ( 32kgf ) , which is equivalent to putting pressure to snap a bundle of five pencils at once			0
' @entity0 added that the test done by @entity21 ' does not show the strength of the back side			1
' it has now asked @entity21 to do the test again on both the front and back sides of the device			1
@entity2 had to go to similar lengths during its own ' @entity44 ' crisis , by allowing reporters into its labs to showcase @entity3 6 plus durability tests			0
@entity0 claims the tests conducted by @entity21 was unfair as 110lbs ( 50kg ) of pressure ' rarely occurs under normal circumstances			1
' @entity139 is the smartphone after the test was conducted @entity0 famously poked fun at @entity2 last year when it emerged its @entity3 could bend out of shape			1

@entity21 's video shows phone breaking under 110lbs of pressure
but @entity0 argues this is an *unrealistic* *portrayal* of everyday forces
it added that *original* test ' does not show the strength of the back side '
@entity0 last year poked fun at @entity2 during its bendgate controversy
