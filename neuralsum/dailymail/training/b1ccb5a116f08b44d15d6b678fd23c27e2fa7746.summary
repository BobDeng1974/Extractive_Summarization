@entity3 was fighting in @entity4 in @entity5 when he learned his wife gave birth to a daughter			1
from the battlefield he penned a letter , sweetly telling the little girl how much he loved her and longed to see her			1
but he never made it home , and the letter and his @entity15 medal ended up in a box thousands of miles away from @entity18 , the daughter who was told nearly nothing about him			1
years after a @entity22 woman found the box of mementos and underwent an exhaustive search to find the daughter who grew up hesitant to ask about her father because it upset her mother , the letter and medal will be handed over to @entity18 on saturday in what figures to be an emotional ceremony in @entity34 , @entity35 , where @entity18 lives			1
@entity18 and @entity36 of @entity34 , @entity35 , are pictured			2
@entity18 was four months old when her father , @entity2			1
@entity3 , was killed in action in @entity5 seven decades later @entity18 is about to get his @entity15 medal and an emotional letter the father she never met wrote just weeks after her birth it was 14 years ago that @entity44 was helping her then - husband clean out his grandparents ' home in @entity48 , @entity22 , a @entity50 suburb			1
@entity51 stumbled upon a cardboard box filled with @entity5 memorabilia related to @entity3 , though no one knows why			1
@entity3 was from @entity55 , @entity22 , about 75 miles southwest of @entity50			1
neither @entity51 nor @entity18 know what connection the @entity48 couple had to @entity3			1
@entity51 sorted through several letters , including the @entity60 's message to @entity3 's mother about his death in @entity63 in june 1944 , four months after his daughter 's birth			1
at the bottom of the box she found the @entity15 , the medal awarded to members of the @entity71 wounded or killed in action			1
@entity51 , of @entity50 , then spent the next 14 years in libraries and on the @entity74 trying to track down the elusive daughter			0
she called every @entity3 in @entity22 , trying to find the right @entity18			1
earlier this year she enlisted the help of friends and began reaching out on @entity79 , leading to a breakthrough -- she found @entity18			2
@entity81 and his wife , @entity82 , are pictured on their wedding day nearly 2,000 miles from @entity50 , @entity18 said she knew her father died in the war , and knew he earned the @entity15			1
but she did n't know what happened to it			0
@entity18 figured her mother had lost the medal or given it away -- until @entity51 called			2
' it was an unforgettable moment , ' @entity51 said			0
@entity18 said she was ' stunned			2
' @entity51 was touched by the medal , and especially moved by the letter in the box penned by @entity3 to his newborn daughter			1
she declined to quote directly from it , saying @entity18 should read it first			2
' it 's basically a soldier who is pouring out his heart on paper to his daughter , ' @entity51 , 46 , said of the letter			1
' it 's a letter written so she would know how much her daddy loved her			2
' beyond his death in war , @entity18 knew little about her father since her heartbroken mother could rarely bring herself to discuss the lost love of her life			2
' my mom did n't tell me much about my dad , ' @entity18 said			2
' i think she was just distraught			0
she was so much in love with him			0
i learned as a young girl not to bring it up because she would just get so upset			0
' this is the @entity15 medal awarded to @entity2			1
@entity81 who was killed in action in @entity63 during @entity5 this photo shows the back side of the @entity15 medal awarded to @entity2			1
@entity81 @entity18 , 69 , grew up in @entity50 and lived there until her mid- 20s			2
by then she was a mother of four young children , but in what she described as an unhealthy marriage			0
she divorced and moved the kids west for a new life in @entity35			0
she spent several years working as an accountant for the state of @entity35 , and remarried in 1997			0
she has since retired from the state job and works at a @entity135			0
@entity51 , also an accountant , decided to make the drive to @entity34 , near @entity137 , to deliver the memorabilia to @entity18			2
she figured it deserved a little more pomp and circumstance			0
so @entity51 wrote a letter to the @entity143 , the volunteer organization perhaps best known for patrolling funerals of soldiers to shield relatives from protesters from @entity148 , the @entity149 , @entity150 - based church whose members believe soldier deaths are @entity154 's retribution for @entity156 's tolerance of homosexuality			0
in the letter , @entity51 said she thought it would add meaning if veterans presented the medal to @entity18			1
before dawn on tuesday , @entity51 , her sister and a friend left @entity50 in an suv , accompanied by about a dozen motorcyclists with the @entity35 unit of the @entity143			0
along the route , different groups of riders are taking turns accompanying @entity51			0
seven decades after the @entity22 soldier died in @entity5 , @entity18 , the daughter he never met is about to get his @entity15 medal , along with the emotional letter her father wrote just weeks after her birth on saturday , a parade will begin in @entity137 and make the 15 - mile trek to @entity34 , where @entity18 will be presented the medal and letter in a ceremony at the high school			1
@entity18 's children and most of her 11 grandchildren and five great - grandchildren will be there , though she 's a bit embarrassed by all the hoopla			0
' i 'm not a big shindig person , ' @entity18 said			0
still , she is bracing for the wave of emotions as she reads the letter for the first time and holds that medal in her hands			0
' i 'll be crying the whole time , ' @entity18 said			0
@entity51 knows she 'll be emotional , too			0
' i 've cherished all of this for a very long time , ' @entity51 said			0
' i 've waited for the finale of this journey for over a decade			0
