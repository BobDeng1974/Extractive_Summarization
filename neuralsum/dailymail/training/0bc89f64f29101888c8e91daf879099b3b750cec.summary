by @entity0 published : 13:31 est , 13 january 2013 updated : 13:31 est , 13 january 2013 with 70ft waves crashing over his upturned boat and 100mph winds whipping his hair , stricken sailor @entity1 had one thought going through his mind - he was going to die			1
the 62 - year - old thought : ‘ i ’ve had a good run			2
i ’ll just have to accept that this is it			2
’ as it turned out , he was wrong			2
he and colleagues @entity13 , 31 , and @entity14 , 57 , lived to tell their tale , but the @entity16 came pretty close to finishing them off			1
the view from a @entity21 @entity20 helicopter shows the scale of the storm and the size of the raft as they waited to pick up the last two survivors out of three about 240 miles off @entity28 , @entity29 @entity30 suffered 11 broken ribs as they struggled with waves that were so powerful they felt like a truck hitting them			1
for six hours they were marooned on their rescue raft surrounded by ‘ the absolute height of nature ’s fury ’ as they waited to die			1
but incredibly a rescue team somehow found them after they set off an @entity46 beacon - and lifted them to safety			1
the trio have now told their story for the first time in a book which explains just how close they came to a watery grave			0
@entity13 clings to a raft during an attempted rescue after @entity14 's boat , the @entity55 sank in rough seas in the @entity16 boat captain @entity60 pictured here in calmer seas with his dog considers himself lucky to have survived the sinking @entity13 ( left ) managed to make it off the ship with @entity1 ( right with beard ) before the @entity55 capsized their journey began when @entity14 placed an advert online in 2007 for a crew for his boat , the @entity55 to travel from @entity73 to the @entity74 , then on to @entity75 and @entity76			1
@entity30 was an experienced sailor and had been at sea since his teens whilst @entity1 was a retired schoolteacher looking for the trip of a lifetime			1
they set off on may 2 that year , which was deliberately early to avoid hurricanes			1
instead they came face to face with @entity87			0
by midday on may 6th , when they were 240 miles off @entity28 , @entity29 , several low pressure systems began to converge with ominous ‘ wispy yellow - brown clouds ’			0
according to an extract in the @entity92 , @entity1 says : ‘ i do n’t think i ’ve ever seen clouds that colour			1
’ suddenly the sky turned dark and winds got to 45 knots ( 52mph )			2
@entity30 writes : ‘ this is not good			0
nothing is going as planned			0
the weather is not as predicted			0
’ in may 2007 the three men set sail across the @entity16 aboard the @entity55 to travel from @entity73 to the @entity74 , then on to @entity75 and @entity76 the wind escalates to 35 , then 60 and then 80 knots			1
the waves rise to 15ft - then surge to 50ft			2
author @entity104 , who has written the book with the men , writes : ‘ more than one wave smacks so hard that @entity1 likens it to being hit by a truck			1
‘ good @entity111 , he thinks , that felt more like a solid object than liquid			0
’ come the next morning , things are even worse when a ‘ thunderous boom ’ sends @entity1 from his bed flying into the air			1
@entity13 smashes into @entity14 and bounces off him ‘ so that his back and buttocks hit the bulkhead where the tv is mounted ; it shatters in a spray of glass and plastic			1
’ the @entity55 is sent ‘ careening over its starboard side			0
objects not bolted down are hurled through the boat like missiles , and canned soft drinks burst like rockets , spraying in all directions			2
’ a table slams into @entity14 , breaking eight ribs			0
the men were hit by subtropical storm andrea -- a storm so powerful that one ship at sea lost 21 containers and the @entity20 would eventually rescue nine people , including mr. @entity1 's crew @entity13 after he had been rescued by the @entity20 and brought onto a rescue helicopter that had raced to meet them after they manage to send a distress call @entity104 writes : ‘ he feels the water climb up the backside of his neck and head , followed by silence as his ears submerge			1
‘ he frantically fights to free himself , but he ’s pinned by the tabletop			0
i ’m going to drown inside my own boat ! ’ the other two men wrestle him clear and , in an astonishing display of bravery , @entity14 swims outside the boat to get the life raft so they can get out of the boat , which is filling up with 2ft of water			2
the books says : ‘ every movement of the boat causes agony that ca n’t be ignored			2
‘ piercing pain radiates from his broken ribs ... an especially large wave breaks directly on him , and the mast is pushed down on the left side of his back , crushing him against the deck			0
‘ he moans in agony			0
another three ribs are broken			0
’ the men manage to scramble into the raft just as the @entity179 sinks - with @entity14 curled up like a baby with blue lips and the beginnings of hypothermia			0
the @entity184 rescue team that piloted the @entity186 helicopter that plucked the three men to safety out of the water @entity13 meanwhile is astonished by the ‘ white capped mountains of water surrounding him ’			1
he surveys the scene which he fully expects will be the last thing he ever sees			0
the book says : ‘ one minute a wave towers above the boat ; the next minute the vessel rises to the top , where @entity13 surveys foam - streaked waves in all directions			1
‘ he has never seen such raw power , the absolute height of nature ’s fury , and he is awestruck			0
’ for his part @entity1 realises ‘ he is witnessing something only a handful of people on earth have ever seen ’			1
they sit there and wait to die - but not before another giant wave sends them crashing back into water , forcing them to haul themselves and the near - unconscious de @entity14 back onto the raft			0
it would be six hours before a c - 130 plane sent by the @entity21 coast guard found them			2
their @entity46 beacon had not actually activated , but an older device somehow had			0
rescuer @entity226 had to be lowered 40ft in 80 knot winds , go into the water and swim to the raft before winching each of the men up to safety			2
the book makes clear that for all three men , their experience affected them deeply and that they will never forget it			0
in an interview at the time , @entity1 put it candidly and said he was haunted by ‘ not just thinking you 're dead , but being convinced of it ’ .			1

@entity60 , @entity1 and @entity13 set sail in may 2007 on what they hoped would be a trip of a lifetime across the @entity16
on may *7th* they encountered the subtropical storm andrea and the *ferocious* winds and waves caused their boat to capsize
they spent almost eight hours in the *treacherous* waters before being rescued by @entity20
