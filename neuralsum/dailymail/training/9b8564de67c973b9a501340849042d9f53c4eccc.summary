' we were your worst weekend '			2
so says @entity2 in @entity4 's latest documentary for @entity5 , the @entity6 , which debuts on the channel on @entity8			1
well , for some of us with long memories who did n't mind seeing the mighty fall every now and then , one particular weekend in may 1988 was actually not too shabby at all			1
mind you , neither was it particularly pretty , nor actually all that romantic , either			2
the story of the @entity6 in a nutshell , in fact			1
@entity20 ( left ) , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 celebrate @entity22 's @entity21 win @entity2 and @entity23 emerge from the documentary as the @entity6 's undoubted leaders what it was , was all about the means to an end in the game when @entity22 pulled off their giant - killing act against the mighty @entity32			1
what the @entity6 does is to tell the story of the 10 years that got them there			1
but unlike the legendary music hall act from which they adopted their name , it proves it was n't just a bundle of laughs and knockabout japes , all the way			2
the @entity6 is a film that works very much as a three act play			1
it starts off by telling of how the division - jumping @entity22 came to be			2
the one where , as then manager and catalyst @entity49 remembers it , they used to ' nick the cones off the @entity53 ' to use on the practise ground			2
and it ends with their @entity57 triumph , and @entity59 really hitting the nail on the head on commentary when he observed ' it 's a one - off club this , i can tell you '			1
@entity67 makes a typically robust challenge on @entity70 columnist @entity69 @entity18 's penalty save is often the best - remembered part of the story , but the @entity6 goes deeper the @entity6 way may have been unorthodox , but it brought the group together as a formidable whole but the middle part of the story takes it down a notch , becomes more considered , and lets us peer just a little uncomfortably into the dark side of what made @entity22 tick			1
it is a fascinating shift in gear , and one that needed to be taken as starkly as it was , so as to help give us the complete picture			0
nevertheless , in spite of the negative elements , when it got down to it , there was still only one conclusion that everybody concerned seemed to come to in the documentary - that it was their way , the @entity6 way , or the highway			1
or probably more 's the point , the aforementioned cone - free @entity53			0
of course , the whole rationale behind what made the @entity6 tick was how that disparate bunch of individuals became the formidable whole			0
and it is those individual personalities that come shining through in this film			1
there may be less hair and more waistline with many of them			0
but that devilment is still very much twinkling away in the eyes			0
@entity116 ( centre ) celebrates after the @entity21 win with coach @entity118 ( left ) plenty of the ex-players who contribute in the documentary have the openness and wit to articulate the thoughts and feelings of the team so well , you may feel you want to question their integrity , but you could never be critical of their honesty			1
@entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity18 , @entity137 ... all of them are sharp , smart and insightful in their telling of the @entity22 story			1
and clearly the kind of men that had more about them than the reputation that preceded them suggested			0
@entity144 is another sharp tack			0
but it is he who resets the tone for the middle part of the story , which coincided with @entity151 leaving for @entity152 and @entity116 and @entity118 coming in and setting them on course for @entity57			1
@entity144 was one of those men drafted in to pep up the side , but spent a lot of his initial time there trying to exorcise the demons that this pressure cooker of a club created			0
@entity18 lifts @entity116 as @entity22 reached their pinnacle in the post @entity167 ' @entity166 era @entity19 , too , speaks well at this point about how he felt he had given up on his football dream			0
@entity172 to creating the atmosphere that made this @entity22 tick was @entity23 and @entity2 , although @entity23 , resplendent for his interview in his country squire attire , defers to the powerful ex-centre forward as being the actual top man			0
he was ' the self - acclaimed leader ... you listen to @entity178 ' was how @entity23 puts it			0
and @entity2 himself is clearly quite happy to accept that accolade			0
he is also very pleased to acknowledge the word ' fear ' as being central to his control of the dressing room			0
and concur that with it came the associated violence			0
@entity17 watches his cup - winning header sail past @entity190 in the @entity32 goal this is not a pretty part of the film to watch , as he clearly revels in those former glories			1
but @entity2 is his own man , and again clearly smart and self - aware with it			0
when speaking of his nemesis at the club , @entity199 - ' any interesting character ' is as far as @entity17 was prepared to go , after a long pause , in describing @entity202 - he says ' i thought i had some chips on my shoulder ! '			0
clearly @entity2 knows all about the well from which he draws			0
this psychodrama finally gives way to the @entity210 story , though			2
and to a man , even those who doubted themselves at the start of their time at @entity22 , point out that they left with a sense of joy and achievement that only coming together as a team and overcoming apparently insurmountable odds can engender			0
the underlying sense of violence is never too far away in the film but the @entity210 story eventually emerges @entity23 kisses the cup held by @entity19 , who admits in the film that he had thought his football dream was over if it was n't certain at the time just how unique that @entity57 win would prove to be ( ' ca n't happen again			1
be impossible ' , says @entity133 at the end of the film ) , @entity233 quickly made sure it would be by offloading nearly the entire team			2
in doing so , of course , sparked off an array of impressive individual careers in the process , and brought to an end to that particular chapter of the @entity22 story			2
a story that , as this beautifully pitched documentary points out , is n't quite as route one as their football used to be			1
@entity5 , @entity8 at 9pm			1

new @entity5 film @entity250 will be shown on @entity8
documentary looks at 10 years leading to the 1988 triumph over @entity32
beautifully pitched film shows more than just the romance of the story
