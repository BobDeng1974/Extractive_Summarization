@entity0 has spotted the ghostly glow of ancient galaxies that were ripped apart by gravity			1
the event happened four billion light - years away inside an immense collection of 500 other galaxies			2
and the remarkable data suggests as many as six such structures were torn up over a period of six billion years			1
scientists at @entity0 in @entity11 have spotted evidence of galaxy destruction in massive galaxy cluster @entity15 , seen here			1
total starlight from the cluster has been coloured blue , with the dispersed light shown in dark blue			0
the light comes from ' dead ' galaxies town apart at the centre of this cluster the finding was made by @entity0 's @entity26 in the @entity15 galaxy cluster , nicknamed @entity15			1
it found that scattered stars from the event were no longer bound to any one galaxy , and drift freely between galaxies in the cluster			2
by observing the light from the orphaned stars , @entity26 astronomers assembled forensic evidence that suggests as many as six galaxies were torn to pieces inside the cluster			1
the doomed galaxies would have been pulled apart like ' taffy ' according to @entity0 if they plunged through the centre of the galaxy cluster where gravitational tidal forces are strongest			1
@entity26 spotted light that came from ' dead ' galaxies			2
the galaxies were torn apart long ago by the cluster 's gravitational forces , and their stars were scattered into ' intracluster ' space - the space between the galaxies			2
these orphaned stars roam the cluster , without being gravitationally tethered to any single galaxy			1
because these extremely faint stars are brightest at near - infrared wavelengths of light , this type of observation could only be accomplished with @entity26 's infrared sensitivity to extraordinarily dim light the intracluster light was detected as part of the @entity65 program , an ambitious three - year effort , begun in 2013 , that teams @entity26 with @entity0 's other @entity68 - the @entity69 and the @entity70 - to probe the early universe by studying large galaxy clusters			1
astronomers have long hypothesised that the light from scattered stars should be detectable after such galaxies are disassembled			0
however , the predicted glow of stars inside such a cluster was very faint and was therefore a challenge to identify			1
' the @entity26 data revealing the ghost light are important steps forward in understanding the evolution of galaxy clusters , ' said dr @entity86 of @entity87 ( @entity88 ) , @entity89 , @entity90			0
' it is also amazingly beautiful in that we found the telltale glow by utilizing @entity26 's unique capabilities			0
' the team estimates that the combined light of about 200 billion outcast stars contributes approximately 10 per cent of the cluster 's brightness			0
' the results are in good agreement with what has been predicted to happen inside massive galaxy clusters , ' said dr @entity104 of the @entity88 , lead author of the paper published the @entity106			0
@entity26 measurements determined that the phantom stars are rich in heavier elements like oxygen , carbon , and nitrogen			0
this means the scattered stars must be second or third - generation stars enriched with the elements forged in the hearts of the universe 's first - generation stars			0
the finding was made by @entity0 's @entity26 ( shown ) in the @entity15 galaxy cluster , nicknamed @entity15			1
it found that scattered stars from the event were no longer bound to any one galaxy , and drift freely between galaxies in the cluster weighing more than four trillion solar masses , @entity15 is a target in the @entity65 program			2
this ambitious three - year effort teams @entity26 and @entity0 's other @entity68 to look at select massive galaxy clusters to help astronomers probe the remote universe			2
earlier this month @entity15 was used to spotted one of the faintest and most distant galaxies ever seen in the universe			0
@entity138 clusters like this one are so massive that their gravity deflects light passing through them , magnifying , brightening , and distorting light in a phenomenon called gravitational lensing			0
astronomers exploit this property of space to use the clusters as a zoom lens to magnify the images of far - more - distant galaxies that otherwise would be too faint to be seen .			0

scientists at @entity0 in @entity11 have spotted evidence of galaxy destruction
using the @entity26 they saw the glow of orphaned stars
these were once inside galaxies but the structures were ripped apart like ' taffy ' by a galaxy cluster over six billion years
as many as six galaxies may have been torn apart at the heart of the cluster
here gravity is strong enough to cause these *dramatic* effects
