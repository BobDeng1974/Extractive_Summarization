by @entity0 these tiny matchstick figures may look like characters from a @entity4 painting but they are in fact a group of tourists admiring the vast expanse of @entity9			2
photographer @entity10 , 46 , took the shots as the sun rose over vast , colourful cliffs during a two day expedition in the notorious @entity16 desert			1
the tiny figures give a sense of the scale of the sprawling landscape , which is the lowest and driest area in @entity22 , and the current holder of the world 's highest recorded air temperature - @entity24 in july 1913			1
stunning : the tiny matchstick figures in these photographs are in fact a group of tourists admiring the vast expanse of @entity9			1
they give a sense of the scale of the sprawling landscape , which is the lowest and driest area in @entity22 and one of the hottest places anywhere on earth colours : @entity10 , who does n't like heights , climbed 650 feet up a steep mountain trail in the @entity40 to take his photographs light : @entity10 said being scared of heights was actually a benefit to his photographs			1
' i really studied the scene			0
there were a tremendous amount of things to look at , and other people tried moving around to get different views of the same things ... i really tried to see what was there , ' he said mr @entity10 , who does n't like heights , braved a steep climb up a trail to the point from which he took his stunning photographs - 650 feet up a mountain in the @entity40			1
he was the only one in his group of five friends to spot a group of @entity64 touring on @entity66 motorbikes below			0
' i do n't think the people were there when i first started shooting , but i 'm not sure ... i am not a big fan of heights and was so nervous			2
the trail we climbed up was steep , narrow , and fell off sharply , ' he said			2
' while other people felt comfortable moving around and changing position , once i got set up i didnt feel like doing a lot of shuffling ... with the winds gusting against my back , i could easily imagine my camera and tripod , my camera bag , or even me tumbling over the edge and straight down , ' he added			0
' the benefit to this was that i really studied the scene			0
there were a tremendous amount of things to look at , and other people tried moving around to get different views of the same things ... i really tried to see what was there and eventually noticed the tiny figures off to my left and down , ' mr @entity10 said			1
observant : the photographer said the rest of his group were too busy focusing on the rolling hills off to the right of the scene to notice the group of tourists gathered below			2
he , on the other hand , used the sense of calm he 'd had to instill in himself just to climb the mountain to maintain focus while taking the photos proud : @entity10 said that he thinks each photo tells a unique and different story			1
he added that he was immensely happy with how well the colours came out and how sharp the photos were			0

' i took a number of photos of the area while the sun came up			2
the colours during that time kept shifting and changing , so i was constantly returning to different ' scenes ' laid out before me as they varied , ' mr @entity10 said			1
' the bright and brilliant reds and magentas you see are a result of the morning light			0
the cliffs are naturally a sort of yellow , lemon colour mixed with browns or darker reds			0
the variation in the tones is due to the different strata and sediments of the rock itself , ' he added			0
' primarily it 's really all about the soft morning light and shooting in the ' golden hours '			0
there was only a short window in which these photos were possible			0
after the sun rose , the gentle colours were washed away			1
about 10 minutes after i took these photos , the rock formations all homogenized back to their usual basic browns , yellows and muddy reds , mr @entity10 went on			1
otherworldly : @entity10 took a number of photos of the area while the sun came up			1
he said the colours during that time kept shifting and changing , so he was constantly witnessing different ' scenes ' being laid out before him as the sunlight varied ' new perspective : after taking the photographs , @entity10 , who lives in @entity115 with wife @entity116 , then hiked back down with his friends for breakfast			1
he said the desert can be disorienting to someone who 's used to a horizon of buildings or being surrounded by corn fields inspiration : the tiny matchstick silhouettes in @entity10 's photograph resemble characters from paintings by the @entity189 - born artist @entity4 after taking the photographs , mr @entity10 , who lives in @entity115 with wife @entity116 , then hiked back down with his friends for breakfast			1
' i loved this area a lot			0
i 've never seen anything quite like it			0
all of @entity9 is magnificent and there 's an ' otherworldly ' feeling about it ... the area is completely unique and there is no place quite like it on @entity204 , ' he said			0
' in general , the desert is sometimes overwhelming and you just ca n't believe you can see that far , that mountains can be that high or stretch so far into the distance , ' he added			2

' if i 'm going to run the risk of tumbling off the edge , i might as well make it worth it ... i think the photos convey the beauty and mystery of the area as well as a sense of serenity and peace , ' he said .			0
