by @entity0 published : 12:41 est , 9 april 2013 updated : 12:41 est , 9 april 2013 @entity1 appeared on @entity3 breakfast show , @entity4 , to defend her controversial writing career today			1
the author , who shot to fame when she wrote the now infamous article that asked women not to hate her for her good looks , said that she does n't regret anything she has penned so far			1
' no i do n't			2
i do n't wish i had n't said it , ' @entity1 told presenter , @entity14			1
' the thing is when you 're writing those opinion pieces , it 's like having a one - sided conversation with your girlfriends over a glass of wine or a coffee			2
' so you 're putting all your opinions across , and then they [ the readers ] , with the help of social media , can put their opinions across			0
' honest : @entity1 appears on @entity4 to give @entity14 the truth behind her controversial comments and put their opinions across they certainly did			1
' it was pretty phenomenal from the moment the piece ran to be honest , ' she said			0
' i mean : my inbox was just full , my phone did n't stop ringing ... people were contacting me from all over the world			2
' i had these insane conversations with producers from @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 ... the first 24 hours were just pretty phenomenal			0
' but it was n't just producers getting in touch			2
in the days after the piece , @entity1 received thousands of messages , many of them cruel , and was on the wrong end of scores of @entity53 taunts , including one from @entity55 star , @entity54			1
' i could n't even speak to my mum because i thought if i did , i thought i 'd cry , ' she told @entity14			2
' i had to keep up that strong front really			0
' asked why she had written the piece in the first place , @entity1 answered : ' i think because really from nursery , from the cradle , we 're taught this idea of false modesty so if i said : " oh , you look good today " , you would say " oh , i do n't look so great today ! , you would bat away the compliment			1
changed woman ? @entity1 told @entity14 that she wo n't be upsetting anyone with her new book the start : @entity1 's ' beautiful ' article was seen by more than a million people and she got a flood of abuse ' i also think i was able to write the piece because i 'm in a really happy relationship and i live in @entity78 where women are really confident			1
' it does n't matter what they look like , they own their space and they know they look good and i definitely think that was the vehicle behind being able to wrote a piece like that			2
' and luckily for @entity1 , loyal husband , @entity90 , was behind her every step of the way			1
' my husband agreed with what i wrote , ' she said in response to @entity14 's questions			1
' he thinks women are really vicious to each another and he 's very black and white in his views and he says what he thinks			1
' he thought it was just bananas , the response to [ the first piece ]			0
he 's not interested in celebrity culture or the lifestyle we all obsess over here			2
' discussion then turned to another controversial article , in which @entity1 had asked whether some women might not be too ugly for tv - again provoking a storm of criticism			1
' well the piece was in response to the @entity117 piece where he wrote about @entity118 , ' responded @entity1			1
' in my defence with that , i worked as a tv producer for nearly 20 years and you only have to look at the @entity123 , @entity124 in her 60s , @entity126 in her 80s , and they 're both incredible , intelligent women who absolutely make the best of themselves			0
' if you look good , you can carry on and get your message across			0
no regrets : @entity1 says meeting @entity90 and moving to @entity78 was the best thing that ever happened to her ' i would n't call [ what she said ] provoking a reaction			1
i 'd call it speaking the truth about the things people think but do n't really want to talk about			0
' she also found time to talk about her new book , @entity143 , which , she insists , wo n't offend anyone			0
' it 's a completely different style of writing , ' she explained			0
' 2007 was probably the worst and best year of my life			0
i lost my tv company , i lost my home , i was penniless ... and i had a fluke holiday in @entity78 , where i had a holiday romance			0
' @entity153 women know that most of the time they do n't really pan out ... mine did , so in september 2007 i took the leap and moved to @entity78 , and my book really chronicles the 12 months where i ended up getting married			0
' and if someone had told me in 2006 that " you 're going to live in @entity78 , you 're going to be a @entity78 housewife , you 'll embrace rural living " i 'd have thought they were off their rocker but i did , and it 's the best thing that 's ever happened to me to be honest			0
author : after her tv career went awry , @entity1 began writing and has now written a book on @entity78			1

@entity1 appeared on @entity3 's @entity4 to defend her record
said she was n't *provocative* , just saying what 's on her mind
revealed that husband @entity90 also says what he thinks
