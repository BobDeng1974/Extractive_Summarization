families will splash out an average of £ 133.70 on christmas day food - but they 'll throw a fifth of it in the bin			1
the day 's feasting will create an extra 50m bags of rubbish , or £ 600m of food			1
as a nation we 'll spend £ 3.3 billion on food for the @entity14 table this year , according to a national survey commissioned by food waste disposer maker @entity17			1
leftovers : @entity20 households will throw away £ 600m worth of wasted food this @entity14 more than half ( 56 per cent ) of 3,000 householders polled admit they will throw away between 20 to 30 per cent of that extra @entity14 food as waste this year - a minimum of £ 600m of @entity14 food thrown directly into our dustbins			1
the knock - on effect of that extraordinary wastage is that 66 per cent of the nation will use between two and four extra bin bags to discard their unwanted @entity14 food in 2011 - approximately 50 million bin bags of extra rubbish just for unwanted @entity14 food ( based on two thirds of the nation using 3 extra bin bags on @entity14 )			2
landfill : the leftover food waste from @entity14 day feasting will fill an estimated 50m bin bags that extra waste also contributes significantly to the 30 extra ' tidying up ' hours that almost half the nation ( 49 per cent ) claims it will undertake during the annual @entity14 break			2
@entity17 spokesman @entity48 said : ' everyone loves @entity14 and @entity20 clearly gets into the spirit of things at this time of year			2
the environmental impact of food waste is a huge concern ' but the environmental impact of our seasonal celebrations is clearly felt across the nation			0
' we create an extra 50 million bags of food waste on christmas day alone			0
' the cost of that food waste is staggering too - £ 600 million			1
it 's truly mind - boggling			0
' the environmental impact is clearly a concern - there is a huge amount of landfill required to house all that waste			0
if people simply had a food waste disposer fitted into their homes it could be dealt with swiftly , efficiently and , most importantly , in a truly eco-friendly responsible fashion designed to reduce impact on landfill sites			0
food waste disposers have a positive impact on landfill and food waste is dealt with through the waste water system when disposed of through a waste disposal unit .			0

@entity20 will spend £ 3.3bn on *festive* food this year - but £ 600m will be tossed away
