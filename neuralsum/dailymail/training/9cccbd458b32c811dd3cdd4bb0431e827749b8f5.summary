by @entity1 reporter this is the incredible moment a pilot tried to land a passenger jet while being hammered by the effects of a super typhoon			0
the first @entity8 jet manages to land safely at the @entity10 airport as the nation was gripped by the @entity12 over the weekend			1
despite a few bumps the pilot manouvres the jet safely and it taxis its no doubt shaken passengers to the gate			0
battling the winds : the plane visibly sways back and forth as the pilot battles to stay in control bumpy ride : the plane bounces along the run way about 10 metres off the ground but the pilot seems unable to lower it any further terrifying : eventually the pilot runs out of runway and is forced to pull the nose of the plane upwards to avoid a crash but just a few minutes later a second plane attempts to come into land with much less success			1
even from a distance the plane can clearly be seen to sway and tilt from side to side in the air			0
as it nears the end of the runway the nose of the plane tips downwards at an alarmingly sharp angle ans stays like that for an alarming couple of seconds before it levels out			2
the plane nears the ground and bounces along 10 metres or so above the ground as the pilot battles to remain in control			0
abort : the plane is forced to take off again at a steep incline and circle to repeat the efforts to land safely devastation : a man rides a bike past a collapsed construction site in @entity60 , south @entity62 @entity61 flooding in the @entity63 : the enormous weather system brought heavy rains which left much of the country submerged the plane travels all the way along the runway just metres above the ground before the pilot finally surrenders and pulls the aircraft upwards to circle away and try again			1
@entity12 was the most powerful typhoon of the year swept past the @entity63 and @entity10 over the weekend but saved the worst of its wrath for their unfortunate neighbours in @entity79 and @entity80			1
@entity12 had gusts exceeding 163 mph leaving on authorities across the region on tenter hooks trying to guess where exactly it would strike land			0
as the storm passed 342 miles south of @entity10 capital @entity92 , the country 's @entity88 said it was veering west , mostly likely sparing the country 's south from the most destructive winds near its eye			2
but gusts of nearly 150mph were recorded on the @entity10 island of @entity101 , and the bureau warned that dangerous winds were buffeting the holiday resort of @entity105 on the @entity107 peninsula			2
wreckage : at least 25 people died on monday after the typhoon south @entity80 's @entity61 where more than 3.56 million people in the province have been affected by @entity12 , and 226,000 people were relocated map of the @entity114 showing the path of @entity116 , packing winds as strong as 162 mph ( 260 kph ) , equivalent to a category 5 hurricane running for cover : this photo shows a man running away from a huge wave pushed up by @entity12 on a wharf in @entity124 , south @entity80 's @entity61 province in the @entity63 , the storm triggered landslides and power outages in parts of the north of the country , including the @entity133 island group , where it made landfall early this @entity137 weather bureau warned that storm surges and heavy waves could cause damage in the @entity133 and other islands in the @entity142 before @entity12 blows past the country by tonight in @entity10 , nearly 2,500 people were evacuated from flood - prone areas and remote mountainous regions as the government deployed military personnel into potential disaster zones.the storm system has dumped more than 8in of rain along the eastern and southern coasts in a 13 - hour period , with officials warning that a total rainfall of 39in could drop before the storm leaves tomorrow			1
local officials closed mountain highways blocked by landslides and suspended train services connecting the east and west coasts as power outages affected thousands of homes			0
@entity12 has a massive diameter of 680 miles , with its outer rain bands extending across @entity142 and all of @entity10 across to the @entity80 coast .			1

*footage* shows nerve - wracking moments two pilots of @entity10 jets attempt to make a *daring* landing in the middle of a typhoon
the first plane managed to make it to *shelter* safely but the second skidded along the runway only to have to taken off again
@entity116 was the biggest of the year so far and affected @entity10 , the @entity63 , @entity79 and @entity80
