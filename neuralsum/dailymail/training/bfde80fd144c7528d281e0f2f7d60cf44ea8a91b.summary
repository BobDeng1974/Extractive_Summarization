by @entity0 once a rare sight , spotting a tattoo on a female ankle or shoulder has become an ubiquitous part of modern life			1
but as this stunning collection of images shows , getting inked is n't quite the modern phenomenon it 's often thought to be			0
while tattoos are a relatively recent phenomenon in @entity14 and the @entity15 , body art has long been part of polynesian culture and has also been found on the mummified remains of @entity20 priests and priestesses			1
now , the 5,000 - year - old history of tattooing has been brought to life in a fascinating new exhibition at the @entity26 , which charts the evolution of body art over the centuries			1
popularised by 19th century explorers returning home to the @entity55 full of tales about the weird and wonderful tattooed women they saw on their travels , tattoos swiftly became the accessory of choice for upper class women			2
such was the intensity of the craze for body art during the @entity51 period , even @entity64 @entity63 is believed to have had one in the form of a bengal tiger fighting with a python by contrast , in many @entity75 , @entity34 and @entity35 cultures , tattoos have long played a significant part in the religious and ceremonial life of communities - and continue to do so in some			2
in the @entity82 , however , tattoos were seen as marginalising and were often used to mark slaves or stigmatise wrongdoers , as was the case with @entity88 's @entity87 ( black code ) in @entity89 , which marked criminals and prostitutes			2
@entity14 sailors in the 1700s got tattoos to mark the lands they had voyaged to : a turtle meant he 'd passed the @entity98 , an anchor signified he had crossed the @entity99 captain @entity100 tattooed by order of @entity102 , @entity103 of @entity104 portrait of an @entity107 woman from the collection of the artist @entity109 at the beginning of the 1830s in @entity113 , sideshows set up their caravans around the big top of travelling circuses			2
they were the itinerant expression of the dime museum , where fairground attractions and anatomical phenomena were exhibited : the armless and legless man , the bearded lady and the person tattooed ' from head to toe '			0
in these antechambers of the sensational , which often employed seasonal or itinerant tattooers , the tattooed performer moreover became a sword - swallower , an animal - tamer , a fireeater , a telepathist , a wrestler , a knifethrower			0
meanwhile @entity14 , which had always been fond of ' curiosities ' in which the marvellous , the farce and scientific illusions merged , welcomed these artists with open arms			0
thanks to these performers , the spectacle of the tattooed body entered its golden age at the start of the @entity147			0
less willing to embrace the art , @entity148 outlawed tattooing			0
it was prohibited in @entity152 and the @entity153 , then officially repressed in 787 by the second @entity154			0
it was still practiced , however , by pilgrims in the @entity157 and even today by the @entity158 , @entity159 and @entity160 of the @entity161			0
the progression of the ink on skin culture is now displayed chronologically for the first time in a stunning new @entity89 book , translated tattoo , @entity168 from full body intricate patterns to colourful , bold , tattoo sleeves , the possibilities for body art are now endless and the creativity seemingly knows no bounds @entity176 : @entity178 boxer , bangkok @entity179 © @entity177 but all that changed in the 1700s , when tattoos came to be seen as a mark of rebellion and free - thinking , and were adopted by bohemian society as well as members of the armed forces			1
sailors , in particular , got tattoos to mark the lands they had voyaged to : a turtle meant crossing the @entity98 , an anchor signified he had traversed the @entity99 , while a dragon symbolised he had travelled @entity195			2
by the end of the 19th century , tattoos had become part of mainstream society , although some still retained their original connotations			2
a particularly noxious part of @entity202 was the kidnap and forcible tattooing of women , who were then press - ganged into work as circus attractions			0
although the popularity of tattooing remained buoyant throughout the 1920s , 30s and 40s , the post-war period saw inking consigned to the wilderness once more			0
left to languish in the fashion wilderness for nearly 40 years , the tattoo next staged a comeback in the 1970s , when they were claimed by the nascent feminist movement before becoming part of the body - conscious beautifying of the 1980s and then gaining mainstream status in the 1990s			1
' volume ' tattooed by the tattoo artist @entity222 ( l ) these and many others trace 5,000 years of ink on skin the last woman tattooed @entity228			1
tattooing in this vast region in the @entity230 declined in the first half of the 20th century © @entity232 now , with tattooing popular once more , the @entity234 museum hopes that the @entity241 , @entity236 exhibition , which is curated by journalists @entity237 and @entity239 of the quarterly @entity89 contemporary art magazine hey ! , will prove popular			1
' tattooing is part of the common heritage of most of humanity , ' say the pair			0
' we wanted to do this exhibition for a long time because we feel it 's important to show that tattooing has a real history and is a pure product of humanity			1
' @entity241 , @entity255 ' runs until october 18th at @entity26 in @entity234			1
see quaibranly.fr for more information inside the @entity241 , @entity258 exhibition which opened on tuesday and runs until late autumn in @entity234 in @entity263 , the moko , a curvilinear and spiral tattoo , was the specific ornament of chiefs and warriors ( l ) the exhibition runs until october 18			1

the history of the tattoo dates back more than 5,000 years to the @entity271
