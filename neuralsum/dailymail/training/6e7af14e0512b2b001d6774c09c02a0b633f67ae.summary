@entity0 offered a defensive opening statement during a may 22 @entity3 hearing , and then refused to answer questions			2
@entity5 argued that she waived her @entity7 rights @entity0 , the @entity8 official who presided over a partisan program that targeted conservative organizations because of their political beliefs , will retire on monday with a full pension package , a source at the @entity14 told @entity15			1
@entity0 , 62 , has been a federal government employee since at least 1981 , making her eligible for the most robust retirement package the federal government offers career employees			1
in may @entity0 herself launched the scandal that would eventually claim her job , by answering a planted question about how the @entity8 handled politically oriented groups that applied for tax - exempt status			1
in less than a day , tea party groups were complaining loudly that their applications had been stalled , in some cases for more than three years			1
less than two weeks later , @entity0 refused to testify in a congressional hearing about the @entity8 's conduct , invoking her @entity7 right against self - incrimination			1
but by making an opening statement defending herself , @entity3 @entity31 said , she waived that right			0
congressional staff told reporters that an internal @entity8 review board had concluded @entity0 was guilty of neglecting her duties , and was about to propose that she should be fired			1
@entity48 held an ' audit the @entity8 ' rally on june 19 in @entity51 rep. @entity52 , the ranking @entity53 on the @entity54 , told the @entity55 that while an @entity56 was set to recommend @entity0 's ouster , it found no evidence of political bias			1
@entity0 is still subject to subpoena and may return to testify in either the @entity54 or @entity62 committee			1
that investigation could have resulted in her termination			0
initially , she claimed that the @entity8 's politically skewed targeting of conservative groups was driven by a handful of rogue employees in the @entity69 , @entity71 office where she worked			1
but documents later surfaced , including some of her own emails , which contradicted that claim and appeared to point to senior managers in @entity51 along with @entity0 herself			2
the @entity54 released some of those emails last week , including one that showed @entity0 singled out tax - exempt applications from organizations that described themselves as ' tea party ' groups , and ordered that the requests should be held in limbo			1
until monday , @entity0 was on administrative leave , collecting her full salary			2
' just because @entity0 is retiring from the @entity8 does not mean the investigation is over			1
far from it , ” @entity92 @entity91 sen. @entity91 said in a statement			0
' in fact , there are many serious , unanswered questions that must be addressed so we can get to the truth			0
' @entity91 is the senior @entity91 on the @entity100 , which oversees the @entity8			0
@entity3 press secretary @entity101 reminded reporters in may that president @entity103 had sought the resignation of the acting @entity8 commissioner , just days after the @entity85 scandal erupted			0
but the @entity107 has been silent on @entity0 's departure @entity54 chairman @entity109 , a @entity110 @entity31 , released previously secret emails last week showing the @entity0 knew early on what the @entity8 was up to rep. @entity113 , a @entity114 @entity31 whose @entity115 has been a consistent thorn in @entity8 's side since the scandal broke , said monday that @entity0 's departure ' does not alter the @entity3 ’s interest in understanding why applicants for tax exempt status were targeted and inappropriately treated because of their political beliefs			1
' ' we still do n’t know why @entity0 , as a senior @entity8 official , had such a personal interest in directing scrutiny and why she denied improper conduct to @entity128			2
her departure does not answer these questions or diminish the @entity3 ’s interest in hearing her testimony			0
' the @entity8 said monday that it ' has taken decisive actions to correct failures in exempt organizations management , replacing top leadership throughout the chain of command			2
' ' our goal is to restore the public 's faith and trust in the tax system , ' the statement added			0
' we have sent nearly 400,000 pages of documents to @entity128 and facilitated dozens of employee interviews			0
we look forward to continuing to cooperate with @entity128 and other investigations			0
' the @entity3 , which trumpeted its may demand for the resignation of former acting irs commissioner @entity151 , has not commented on @entity0 's departure			0
@entity62 chairman @entity113 ( r ) and ranking @entity53 @entity153 ( @entity154 ) have crossed swords over claims that the @entity8 systematically delayed and unfairly scrutinized tax - exempt status applications from right - wing groups the @entity159 provides 1.1 per cent of a retiree 's salary for every year worked , provided he or she is a 20 - year veteran who is at least 62			1
@entity0 's base pension would be be calculated based on what she earned , on average , during the past 36 months			1
according to the @entity165 , @entity0 joined its general counsel ’s office in 1981 , and was appointed in 1986 to head the agency 's @entity167			2
' prior to joining the @entity165 , she was a staff attorney in the @entity170 of the @entity171 , ' the @entity165 said in a 2000 news release			0
it 's not clear when she first came to work at the @entity171 , or what her annual salary was			0
but if she were in the middle of the senioer - level ' @entity178 ' earning scale and worked just one year in the @entity171 as a staff attorney before joining the @entity165 , she would collect 1.1 per cent of $ 140,259 for each of 33 years -- for a total of more than $ 50,900 per year in taxpayer dollars			1
if @entity0 's position as a top @entity8 enforcer were to place her in a special ' law enforcement officer ' retirement category , that amount would jump to over $ 61,700			2
in 2010 the @entity190 median personal income was just over $ 29,000			0
@entity0 will receive 50 percent credit for any unused sick leave she has accrued , according to an attorney at the @entity159			0
she could also seek other full - time employment in a law firm or an advocacy group , and still keep her government pension as a secondary source of income .			0

the *notorious* former chief of tax - exempt groups at the @entity8 has been on paid leave for more than three months
retiring before the @entity205 can fire her allows @entity0 to keep her pension earned through at least 33 years in the federal government
last week @entity210 released emails showing @entity0 was aware early on that her agency was politically targeting tea party groups
@entity8 critic and @entity62 chairman rep. @entity113 says the fight is *n't* over
