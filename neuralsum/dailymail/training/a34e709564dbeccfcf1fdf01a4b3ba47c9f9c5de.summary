@entity1 scientists say that taking as little as 20 minutes of exercise three times a week may be enough to reduce the risk of @entity5 's taking 20 minutes of exercise three times a week could drastically reduce the risk of @entity5 ’s , research shows			1
@entity1 scientists say that even getting off the bus one stop early and walking the rest of the way could help prevent the devastating illness			1
they have found that a third of all cases are due to lifestyle reasons including inactivity , obesity , smoking , high blood pressure and having a poor education			1
but of these , a lack of exercise was found to be the single most important cause			1
researchers believe regular physical activity ensures there is a steady flow of oxygen - rich blood to the brain			1
this is thought to prevent the build - up of plaques – deposits of protein in the brain which cause @entity5 ’s			1
a total of 850,000 @entity36 have been diagnosed with dementia – including @entity5 – although this will more than double by 2050 as the population ages			2
there are no effective treatments and the illness is having a devastating effect on families and placing an increasing burden on the @entity46			0
but the researchers say adults can drastically lower their risk even by just walking to work			2
professor @entity51 , from @entity1 ’s @entity52 , said : ‘ the important message is that there are aspects of healthy life which reduce risk			2
‘ this does n’t say we can prevent dementia and @entity5 ’s altogether			2
but there is a proportion which is preventable			0
even just having a vigorous walk a few times a week , and ideally make it social event			2
' it ’s really difficult for many people to take exercise			0
if nothing else is possible , even a walk will help			0
that ’s what evidence suggests			0
‘ so 20 minutes to half an hour , three times a week			1
i would say to just fit something into life in the best possible way			0
this might be getting off the bus stop the next stop up , and walk the last bit			1
’ @entity46 guidelines say adults should do at least two - and - a - half hours of exercise a week , including gardening or housework			1
but more than a third do n’t manage this , including a fifth who are classed as ‘ inactive ’ , doing less than 30 minutes a week			2
professor @entity51 said that if someone started exercising they would be more inclined to eat healthily and give up smoking , further reducing their risk of dementia			0
the research , published in the journal @entity99 , looked at almost 30 studies linking dementia to various lifestyle causes			0
a lack of exercise contributed to 22 per cent of cases , twice as many as any other cause			0
a third of all cases of @entity5 's are due to lifestyle factors such as obesity , smoking , high blood pressure , and poor education - but of these a lack of physical activity was found to be most significant other researchers are trying to establish exactly how physical activity prevents dementia and if any particular type is more effective			1
they suspect that it keeps the heart and blood vessels strong , which maintains a steady flow of blood to the brain			0
this may prevent the build - up of plaques , protein deposits in the brain which are thought to trigger @entity5 ’s but professor @entity51 said that in the meantime , adults should try to fit exercise into their lives			1
he said : ‘ simply tackling physical inactivity , for example , will reduce levels of obesity , hypertension and diabetes , and prevent some people from developing dementia , as well as lead to a healthier old age in general – it ’s a win - win situation			1
’ dr @entity144 , of the @entity145 , said : ‘ this valuable study adds to a growing body of evidence strongly suggesting that simple lifestyle changes can help lower our risk of developing dementia			0
' regular exercise is a good place to start , as well as avoiding smoking and eating a @entity156 diet			0
’ statistically , one in three adults over 65 will develop dementia			0
@entity5 ’s is the most common form			0
more than a third of people do n't manage to get the recommended two and a half hours of exercise per week , with a fifth classed as ' inactive ' , getting less than 30 minutes			1

scientists say inactivity is most important lifestyle factor for @entity5 's
believed exercise keeps blood flowing to brain reducing build - up of plaque
just 20 minutes of physical activity three times a week could cut risk
simply getting off bus one stop early and walking home could help
