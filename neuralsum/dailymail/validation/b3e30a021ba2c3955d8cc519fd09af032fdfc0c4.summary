the names of two @entity2 police commanders who resigned from their positions in the @entity4 over racist emails have been released amid the @entity6 @entity8 's investigation into the police department			1
sgt. @entity10 and capt. @entity11 resigned thursday and @entity13 clerk @entity12 was fired wednesday			1
it is unclear whether the three were recipients or senders of the ' racially biased ' emails included in the 102 - page civil rights report released wednesday by the @entity8 accusing the department of illegal practices targeting african - americans			1
@entity22 is seen in an undated photograph smiling as @entity24 , the @entity25 police officer who gunned down @entity26 , an unarmed , @entity27 - @entity27 teen , has his arm around her			1
the two are seen appearing joyful among colleagues and friends , including @entity25 mayor @entity33			1
' @entity10 is reportedly associated with a 2011 email suggesting a @entity55 woman was paid by ' @entity56 ' to terminate her pregnancy			0
the @entity8 highlighted several other emails in the report including one that featured a photograph of topless , appearingly tribal , women dancing , with the caption ' @entity66 's @entity65			2
' the report states that the emails illustrate racial , ethnic , or other forms of bias among those involved and states that the @entity8 's investigation yielded no indication that any of the officers or clerks involved in the emails were disciplined before this week			2
in fact , the report states , there were no instances discovered where recipients asked the sender to refrain from sending such emails , instead , the emails were forwarded along to others			0
* the list above is highlighted emails found in the @entity8 's 102 - page report on the @entity4			1
the investigation also found that almost all of the emails were sent during work hours through government email accounts			0
officials say that at least one of the email recipients was among city leaders who met with @entity8 officials to discuss the investigation , the @entity95 reports			0
the report also adds that evidence found shows not only racial bias , ' but racial bias by those with considerable influence over the outcome of any given court case			0
' the @entity8 's civil rights investigation into the @entity47 suburb of 21,000 came after @entity24 fatally shot the unarmed black teen on aug. 9 , an action that sparked nationwide protests and cast @entity25 's mostly white police force in a negative light			1
a grand jury did not indict @entity24 for killing 18 - year - old @entity26			1
though the @entity8 found no grounds to prosecute @entity24 , the case did spark suspicions into the department 's practices			2
@entity6 attorney general @entity124 called the @entity8 's report ' searing , ' saying the investigation found the @entity25 community to be one where both policing and municipal court practices were found to be ' disproportionately harmful to @entity27 residents			1
' ' this investigation found a community that was deeply polarized , ' @entity124 said			0
' a community where deep distrust and hostility often characterized interactions between police and area residents			0
' a community where local authorities consistently approached law enforcement not as a means for protecting public safety but as a way to generate revenue			0
' @entity25 mayor @entity33 said friday that the city is pursuing reforms to reach a settlement with the @entity8 , @entity147 reports			1
the mayor said the city has been carrying a surplus of nearly $ 5 million to handle expenses related to the reform			0
justice : the @entity8 's civil rights investigation into the @entity47 suburb of 21,000 came after a white @entity25 police officer , @entity24 ( right ) fatally shot an unarmed black teen , @entity26 ( left ) on aug. 9 protests : the grand jury 's decision not to indict the @entity25 police officer sparked nationwide protests and cast @entity25 's mostly white police force in a negative light @entity33 said that while the @entity8 did highlight many things in the report that must be addressed , there are also things that are an ' over reach			1
' @entity33 did not comment on whether police chief @entity171 would step down , @entity147 reports , amid calls for the chief to do so by some community and civil rights leaders			0
the report highlighted the department 's practices saying the city 's focus on revenue greatly impacts the police department 's approach to law enforcement and the role of @entity25 's municipal court			2
the report states : ' the @entity189 handles most charges brought by the @entity4 , and does so not with the primary goal of administering justice , or protecting the rights of the accused , but of maximizing revenue			0
' the department also exhibited evidence of racial stereotyping , the report states			0
several @entity25 officials told the @entity8 that @entity27 residents exhibit a lack of ' personal responsibility ' which causes the group to experience harm			2
however , the @entity8 found that though some people lack personal responsibility , -- including officers within the police department -- the reason @entity27 in the city experience ' disproportionate ' harm is the result of the department 's many ' systematic deficiencies			1
' * the list above is highlighted evidence found in the @entity8 's 102 - page investigation into the @entity4 based on the department 's findings and research @entity4 : the report found that some practices of the @entity4 violate law and are unconstitutional in that they violate the @entity225 the report highlighted the fact that african - americans make ' extraordinary ' efforts to pay off overly expensive tickets for often minor , unfairly charged violations			1
court records and emails show that while african - americans struggled to pay the expensive tickets , city officials including the @entity235 , the court clerk , and department supervisors helped their friends , colleagues , and even themselves in eliminating tickets , fees , fines , and citations			1
the report highlighted a 2014 incident where the court clerk received an email from a relative with a scanned copy of a ticket asking for help			2
the clerk responded : ' your ticket of $ 200 has magically disappeared ! the report does not mention @entity22 by name when referring to the ' @entity258			2
' but in capitalizing ' @entity258 , ' the report appears to refer to the head clerk -- who , the report noted , is white			0
the report found that some practices of the @entity4 violate law and are unconstitutional in that they violate the @entity225 , which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures by law enforcement and requires any warrant to be supported by probable cause .			0

sgt. @entity10 , capt. @entity11 , and city court clerk @entity12 resigned or were fired from the @entity272
the three are no longer with the department as a result of their involvement in racially charged or biased emails
both @entity10 and @entity11 were associated with emails exhibiting racism or other biases
a 102 - page report by the @entity8 shows illegal practices , racism , and abuses of power within the @entity4
@entity22 is seen in an undated picture next to @entity24 , the @entity25 police officer who killed @entity26 , an unarmed @entity27 - @entity27 teen
a grand jury 's decision not to indict @entity24 for killing @entity26 sparked nationwide protest
