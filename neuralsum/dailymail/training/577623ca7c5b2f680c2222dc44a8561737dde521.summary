former @entity1 footballer @entity0 has been inundated with critical messages after starring in a ' sexist ' new car ad			1
in the ad , which was made on behalf of his local car dealership , @entity0 , who is married to childhood sweetheart @entity8 , compares women to luxury cars and goes on to boast about the ' dozens ' of @entity11 he owns			1
' you 've got to go for looks to start with , ' said the star in the clip , before adding : ' then you look inside			0
it 's probably similar to girls is n't it ? awkward ! in the new advert former footballer @entity0 compares women to luxury cars ' the look attracts you to start with and then you get to know them a bit more , i think it 's the same with cars			1
' @entity29 , a director at @entity30 , the dealership behind the ad , defended @entity0 's statement when contacted by @entity33			1
' i think it 's a fair comparison , ' said mr @entity29			0
' you are attracted to the outside but ultimately , it 's what 's on the inside that counts and that 's what he was trying to say			0
' we actually filmed three hours of footage so that was just a very small part of it			0
' the cringe - making video , which is set to a classical soundtrack , begins with @entity0 , 34 , standing in the middle of the garage surveying the cars around him			1
during the two - minute ad , he goes on to make several more gasp - worthy claims			2
what a stunner : @entity0 films in front of his new @entity58 , hopefully @entity55 offered him some sort of a discount it 's a done deal : @entity0 shakes hands with car dealer @entity29 after receiving his new @entity58 ' i 've owned quite a variety of cars over the years , ' he says			1
' my first car being a @entity58 coupe , [ i then ] progressed to a @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity58			0
it 's great to come back home so to speak			0
' i had a deal with @entity75 for a long time as well , so probably had a dozen @entity11 and a few others			1
' he continued : ' you know , you grow with cars i was never going to get a @entity71 at 18 or something			0
you wait until you 've earned your stripes so to speak			0
' @entity0 - who was once reported to have a net worth of £ 40million - was clearly unaware that for most , the stumbling block to @entity75 ownership is not being too young but being unable to afford the £ 170,000 price tag			1
not content with that , @entity0 added : ' in football there is a hierarchy so if you go in with a nicer car than someone who has played a 100 games and played for his country then you 'll be quickly slapped down and told to sell it			2
@entity96 ? many have compared former @entity1 star @entity0 's punditry to the fictional character @entity99 @entity100 striker : @entity0 celebrates a goal during the the 2002 @entity102 ' you have to grow your car organically as i say with how you 're doing on the football pitch			1
' defending his star , mr @entity29 added : ' @entity0 was a pleasure to work with			2
we have known him for years and he have previously worked with him and his family through the equestrian side of the business			0
' he was very happy to take part in the advert and we will be working with him again			0
' ' i met the chaps @entity117 and @entity118 [ of @entity30 ] , ' added @entity0 , ' and we 've done a bit of business in the horsey world as well and obviously they picked a really nice one for me			2
' i 've driven @entity58 before but it 's probably eight , 10 years ago so the new model is lovely and i ca n't wait to put some miles on it			0
' when he 's not promoting car dealerships , @entity0 - who during his career enjoyed stints at @entity130 , @entity131 and @entity132 - works as a footballing pundit but has seen his efforts compared to @entity99			1
chaps chatting : @entity0 chats to @entity29 one of the directors of the company away you go : at the end of the advert @entity0 got to drive off in his brand new @entity58			2
