@entity1 back @entity0 has been fined $ 45,000 by the @entity2 , but has avoided suspension and having his contract terminated following a marathon code of conduct hearing on friday			1
the hearing at @entity2 headquarters in @entity8 lasted almost four hours , but it was another two hours before the results were announced			2
an independent tribunal found @entity0 guilty of a serious violation of the @entity2 code of conduct , and imposed the fine for sending an offensive photograph to an @entity2 employee			1
@entity0 admitted to sending the photo on june 9			1
the tribunal found while a serious violation had occurred , mitigating factors were taken into account to determine an appropriate sanction			2
these included @entity0 's contrition , the unpleasant consequences the matter had created for the @entity2 employee and @entity0 , and the fact @entity0 had already effectively been suspended from recent matches			1
@entity2 ceo @entity44 said the tribunal 's findings and sanction would be accepted			2
' this was a serious allegation and , like any business , when we received that complaint , we were compelled to investigate it and give @entity0 an opportunity to present his case in relation to the matter in an independent forum , ' @entity44 said			1
' we have obligations to our fans and the broader community and we are committed to ensuring any behaviour that has the potential to breach our code of conduct or values is investigated and taken seriously			2
' this was deemed a serious violation by the tribunal and , as such , we intend to donate the $ 45,000 collected through this fine to a suitable organisation that promotes the empowerment of women			1
@entity74 , left , was copied into a message sent by @entity0 in june and has become subject of an @entity2 investigation ' negotiations regarding @entity0 's contract beyond this year have been on hold in recent weeks			1
as a result of the independent tribunal 's decision , we will re-open those contract discussions			0
' @entity85 ceo @entity84 said it was a positive outcome that the tribunal found the more offensive text and photo had not been sent by @entity0			1
' we are pleased that @entity0 , having shown remorse and incurring the penalty , will now be in a position to continue his rugby career			2
' following the decision , @entity0 apologised for breaching the code of conduct			2
' i am satisfied with tonight 's outcome			0
there was conjecture about my contract being terminated , however the tribunal agreed that - on the basis of the evidence - that a fine was appropriate			0
' i 'm relieved there is no termination and no suspension and i can now continue playing rugby			0
' i 'm also happy the evidence presented to the tribunal did not establish that i sent the second text and photograph			2
this is why i fought so hard to prove my innocence regarding that text			2
' i 'd like to apologise to ( former @entity1 business and logistics manager ) @entity74 and the broader community for my behaviour , particularly to rugby fans			1
' i have had a fair hearing tonight and will work to regain the respect of my teammates , fans and the general @entity127 community			0
