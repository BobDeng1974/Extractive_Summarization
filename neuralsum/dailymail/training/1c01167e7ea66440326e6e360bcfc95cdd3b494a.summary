exclusive by @entity1 published : 09:30 est , 1 january 2014 updated : 11:07 est , 1 january 2014 if you ’ve ever wondered what happens to your bag when you bid it farewell at an airport check - in desk , then here ’s your chance to go behind the scenes			2
@entity12 has been granted exclusive access at @entity14 of @entity15 to @entity17 ’s biggest single - terminal baggage handling system			1
there are 30 miles of conveyors at @entity15 - with 2.8 miles of tunnels , 44 baggage reclaim belts and around 53million bags processed every year			2
bags are entered into the system by airline staff at check - in desks , which feed a pair of tilt - tray sorters that deliver bags to the baggage hall			1
luggage is then transferred to containers by airline baggage staff at @entity15 and driven to the aircraft for manual loading			0
a fast - track underground system can deliver time - critical bags to individual heads of stands , and @entity14 also has an early bag store			1
up to 4,000 bags checked in three hours prior to a departure can be stored in this facility in the basement and held until called out for a flight			1
airline agents at check - in attach a luggage tag to the bag , with a unique barcode and ten - digit number which has the bag ’s destination and route			2
on the move : bags travel on the conveyer belt in little carts in @entity15 's @entity105 , which connects @entity30 to @entity106 big distance : the tunnel which connects @entity30 to @entity106 in the @entity105 is the longest inter-terminal transfer tunnel in @entity17 project : @entity15 is in the process of developing a new @entity106 baggage system , which when complete will be the most advanced integrated baggage facility in @entity17 along they go : the new @entity106 baggage system will increase the terminal 's baggage handling capacity from 5,200 to 7,200 bags per hour technical : bags coming in to the new @entity106 baggage system will be sorted automatically by size , weight and flight number			1
they are then taken to be loaded onto containers movements : the photographs give an insight to those who have ever wondered what happens to your bag when you bid it farewell at an airport check - in desk piled up : state - of - the - art devices load the flight containers by scanning each bag to make sure they are positioned to make the best possible use of space the bag is then read by a barcode scanner and routed through the network of conveyors to a collection chute for processing by baggage handling staff			1
it passes through x-ray machines and other security devices , before a baggage handler scans the bag ’s barcode tag at the collection chute			0
this links each item of luggage to the passenger list			0
the handler then loads bags onto carts , which are driven out to the aircraft for loading in the hold			0
when it comes to transfer bags , these are unloaded and placed in the baggage system , where they are scanned , screened and sorted for reloading			2
bags coming in from other terminals which need to go onto @entity30 - or vice-versa - are automatically funnelled through the new @entity105			0
on the ground : a @entity63 truck with containers full of baggage - which have been on a long journey since they were checked in - prepares to load a plane nearing the end of its airport journey : ground staff wearing fluorescent jackets prepare to load a @entity63 plane with a container arrivals : after flight the bags make the return journey through the baggage system at @entity15 and are ready to be picked up by passengers collections : a £ 26million tunnel was built to try to ensure every passenger at the airport was reunited with their baggage regardless of which terminal they fly to getting ready to fly : @entity63 @entity199 aircraft are prepared prior to take off from @entity200 in @entity41 the terminal became synonymous with lost luggage when it first opened , with @entity63 losing 270,106 bags in the first three months of 2008			1
but the £ 26million tunnel was built to try to ensure every passenger at the airport was reunited with their baggage regardless of which terminal they fly to			0
the 1.1 - mile link runs under the @entity14 airfield and links up with @entity211 and 3			2
terminal 1 and 4 are already linked by a tunnel , built in 1997			0
almost six years ago in march 2008 , around 70 flights were cancelled on the first day of @entity63 's move to the £ 4.3billion terminal			0
then about 28,000 items of luggage went missing over the next few weeks			0
the disruption was caused by glitches in the baggage handling system .			1
