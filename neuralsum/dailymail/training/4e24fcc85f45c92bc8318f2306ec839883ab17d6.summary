only a small minority of people have ever seen the ghostly crimson lights that dance on top of thunderstorms			0
known as ' red sprites ' , these rare flashes create red tendrils more than 50 miles ( 80 km ) above the ground that last for just a few milliseconds			1
now , photographer @entity10 has been able to capture this incredible sight at the @entity12 on the outskirts of the @entity15 desert			1
the @entity16 can be seen just to the right of centre of the image and the faint green streak of a meteor just to the left of the @entity23 striking heavenly regulars are eclipsed , however , by the presence red sprites ( bottom left of the main image )			1

these striking heavenly regulars are eclipsed , however , by the presence of something far more elusive and much closer to home			0

named after @entity45 ’s mischievous sprites @entity43 , from @entity46 , and @entity47 , from @entity48 , sprites are caused by irregularities in the ionosphere			2
the incredible flashes of light are caused by huge electrical discharges of lightning in the sky , and they get their deep red hue from nitrogen molecules in the air			1

atmospheric sprites have been known for nearly a century , but their origins were a mystery			0
they only last a few milliseconds and are relatively dim compared with other lightning			2
the late experimental physicist @entity98 accidentally discovered sprites , while helping to test a new low - light video camera in 1989			2
typically seen as groups of red - orange flashes , they are triggered by positive cloud - to - ground lightning			2
this is rarer and more powerful than its negative counterpart , as the lightning discharge originates from the upper regions of the cloud , further from the ground			0
in a short burst , the sprite extends rapidly downwards , creating dangling red tendrils before disappearing			0
the sprites pictured here occurred over the course of about 40 minutes and were most likely more than 310 miles ( 500km ) away			1
in october , another photographer was able to capture this elusive light after spending months on the road following storms in @entity121 , @entity122			2
@entity123 , 32 , managed to capture the rare pictures whilst standing in a corn field , over 200 miles ( 320km ) away from the phenomenon			2
' sprites are not easy to capture , and might occur just a few times in hours , but this storm system was very active this time			0
' it was very difficult to get these shots as they are so rare and you simply have to be quite lucky that the storm will produce them			0
' you might take hundreds of photos without capturing any of them , ' added mr @entity123 , who works as a system administrator for highways in @entity140			0
atmospheric sprites have been known for nearly a century , but researchers have been baffled as to how , and why , they form			0
in may , @entity144 researchers managed to model the elusive phenomenon , which forms above thunderstorms and appears as a ' jellyfish ' shape in the sky			0
they say they believe that sprites form at plasma irregularities and may be useful in remote sensing of the lower ionosphere – an area that facilitates radio communication on @entity81			2
for decades , airline pilots were the only people lucky enough to catch sight of the natural phenomenon known as red sprites			1

red sprites are rare bursts of light that last for a few milliseconds and take place 50 miles ( 80 km ) above @entity81
@entity179 photographer , @entity10 , caught sight of these lights at the @entity12 in the @entity15 desert
the red sprites flashed for about 40 minutes and were around 310 miles ( 500km ) away from the photographer
the flashes are caused by electrical discharges of lightning , and they get their red hue from nitrogen in the air
