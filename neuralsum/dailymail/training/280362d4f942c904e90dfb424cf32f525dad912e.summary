speaking out : @entity0 described the @entity1 as ' the biggest error in modern history ' the political row over the @entity1 has intensified after one of @entity7 's best - known historians declared that the conflict was ' the biggest error in modern history '			1
@entity10 professor @entity0 argues that @entity7 should never have entered the war against @entity12 , saying that ' the cost was catastrophic ' and it was not worth the millions of lives lost			1
he is the latest historian to weigh in on the origins of the war after @entity16 took aim at ' left - wing academics ' who have perpetuated a view of the conflict as an unmitigated disaster			1
the @entity23 blamed experts for the picture of the @entity1 put forward in popular culture such as @entity27 , which focuses on the casualties of battle and the blunders made by aristocratic officers			0
he faced a backlash from some eminent historians , as well as his @entity36 opposite number @entity37 - but mr @entity0 is the first figure from the @entity39 to speak out against his views			0
in an interview with @entity45 , the @entity42 professor and author said : ' @entity7 could indeed have lived with a @entity12 victory			1
what 's more , it would have been in @entity7 's interests to stay out in 1914			1
' mr @entity16 wrote in the @entity50 was a ' just war ' , essential for ' defending the western liberal order ' by constraining the imperial ambitions of @entity12 and @entity54			1
carnage : soldiers carrying a stretcher on the front line in @entity59 during the @entity1 but mr @entity0 , 49 - who is presenting a @entity61 series based on his 1998 book @entity63 - disputed this judgement , saying that sending millions of troops to the continent was unnecessary to defend @entity7 's interests			1
' @entity7 could indeed have lived with a @entity12 victory , ' he said			2
' what 's more , it would have been in @entity7 's interests to stay out in 1914			2
' a better strategy would have been to wait and deal with the @entity12 challenge later , when @entity7 could respond on its own terms			2
' ' even if @entity12 had defeated @entity75 and @entity76 , it would have had a pretty massive challenge on its hands trying to run the new @entity12 - dominated @entity79 and would have remained significantly weaker than the @entity80 in naval and financial terms			0
' under fire : education secretary @entity16 is embroiled in a political row about the war 's origins it was on the 28 july 1914 that artillery units of @entity54 began to rain down shells on @entity89 , the @entity91 capital - the very first shots of the @entity1			1
that attack was to start a chain reaction that , within weeks , embroiled all of the world 's great powers into a global war which mobilised more than 70million military personnel			0
@entity1 - as it was soon to be known - was the first military conflict to be fought on an industrial scale			2
but the technological advances that led to increases in the lethality of weapons were not matched by changes in strategy , with both sides resorting to practically suicidal human wave attacks			0
although much of the warfare took place in @entity79 , battle was soon joined across the planet via the colonies of the @entity115 imperial powers			0
by 1918 , the powers of @entity79 were exhausted by fighting			0
a final last - ditch offensive along the @entity120 by @entity12 was successfully repelled and , as @entity122 forces began to enter the trenches , the @entity118 staged a series of successful advances , forcing the enemy to surrender on november 11			2
mr @entity0 - who is @entity128 at @entity10 and a fellow of @entity130 , @entity127 - continued : ' the cost of the @entity1 to @entity7 was catastrophic , and it left the @entity80 empire at the end of it all in a much weakened state			1
' arguments about honour , of course , resonate today , as they resonated in 1914 but you can pay too high a price for upholding that notion of honour , and i think in the end @entity7 did			0
' some have argued that @entity7 had a moral obligation to join the war because of its treaty with @entity149 , which was invaded by @entity12 , but the historian dismissed this idea			1
' realism in foreign policy has a long and distinguished tradition , not least in @entity7 - otherwise the @entity75 would never complain about " perfidious @entity155 " , ' he said			0
' for @entity7 it would ultimately have been far better to have thought in terms of the national interest rather than in terms of a dated treaty			0
' mr @entity0 concluded : ' we should not think of this as some great victory or dreadful crime , but more as the biggest error in modern history			0
' he has previously been seen as an ally of mr @entity16 , having advised the minister on the new history syllabus and spoken out in support of his educational reforms			2
but his intervention in the @entity1 debate puts him on the side of figures such as @entity177 professor sir @entity176 , who described the @entity23 as ' a donkey who pretends to be a lion ' and accused him of historical ignorance			0
after mr @entity0 's interview was released , other historians stuck up for mr @entity16 's point of view and insisted that the war was justified			1
@entity186 , professor of war studies at the @entity187 , wrote on @entity188 : ' contrary to @entity0 's views , for @entity7 to have stayed out of @entity1 would have disastrous for @entity7 and @entity79			1

@entity10 's @entity0 says the cost of @entity1 was ' catastrophic '
insists @entity7 did not have to enter war against @entity12 in 1914
@entity16 has previously spoken out against ' left - wing ' view of conflict
