@entity0 took a giant leap towards dominating the golfing world by winning the @entity3 last year , so it was fitting that he posed with a baby kangaroo on his return to @entity6 on tuesday			1
@entity0 endured a dismal year for most of 2013 but is back down under looking to defend the title which kick - started his stunning resurgence - the @entity10 claimed two majors this year , starred at the @entity12 and is the undisputed world no 1			1
' @entity14 to be back defending the @entity3 and the @entity15 is looking amazing , ' said @entity0 on @entity16 as he posed for a picture with a @entity18 in @entity19			1
given @entity0 's brilliant performances this year , which brought major victories in @entity35 and @entity36 plus two other wins , it is hard to believe just how bad 2013 was in comparison			1
@entity0 struggled to adapt to his new equipment , fell out with his management company and walked off the course during his defence of the @entity43 , not to mention labelling his own play ' brain dead ' when missing the cut in the @entity3 at @entity47			1
the 25 - year - old had to wait until december to win his first tournament of 2013 at @entity6 , denying @entity26 the triple crown after the @entity51 champion had won the @entity30 pga and @entity30 masters			1
@entity0 limbers up before his practice round at @entity55 on tuesday the world no 1 has enjoyed a brilliant year in which he has won two major champpionships @entity0 shows off his swing ahead of the tournament , which begins on thursday @entity0 hits out of a bunker during his practice round ahead of his final tournament of the year twelve months on @entity0 returns to @entity6 - albeit a different golf course - already thinking about completing a career grand slam in the masters next april and brimming with confidence			1
' this year has been full of ups and downs , mainly ups , which is a great thing , ' said @entity0 , who won the @entity72 at @entity73 in may just days after calling off his wedding to tennis star @entity75			1
' i learned a lot from it and i feel like i came through this year stronger and wiser , and i can go into 2015 in a much better place			2
i 'm happy with the success that i 've had and i feel like there 's been a lot that i 've learned this year , as well , and that 's a great thing going into the future			2
' this week 's a big week			2
i want to go down there and play well and do a good job with defending my title			0
after that i 've got a pretty busy week			2
i 'm not playing golf but i 've got a few other commitments and things to do			0
victory at the @entity3 last year was the springboard to success in 2014 for @entity0 ' but i 'll have a little bit of downtime over @entity97 and @entity98 , which will be nice			1
i 'll start practising again early on in the new year and getting ready for @entity99			0
' @entity0 has now spent a total of 56 weeks as world no 1 during his career and feels he has finally come to grips with the responsibility which accompanies such a lofty position			1
' i used to be uncomfortable , ' added @entity0 , who is in his fifth spell at the top of the rankings			2
' you get to the point where there 's added scrutiny and there 's added criticism or whatever it is			0
' but i learned to deal with it			0
it 's just part of the title now , world no 1			0
that 's what it comes with			0
i 've become comfortable with it			0
' i 've spent more than a year of my career at world no 1 , so if i 'm not used to it by now , then there 's something wrong			0
it 's where i want to be			0
i want to be the best player in the world and i want to keep it for as long as i possibly can			0
