the equation was simple : sex = infidelity			0
but now ' cheating ' has taken on a whole new meaning , and it 's mostly thanks to social media			0
emotional infidelity - deep , passionate connections between people who often are n't even aware they 've crossed the line from platonic friendship to romantic love - is turning out to be the biggest threat marriage has ever faced			1
social media has blurred the definition of ' cheating ' , and just because you 're not actually having sex with someone else does n't mean you 're not being unfaithful to your partner by flirting with other men @entity33 and @entity34 , with their ' harmless ' online flirtations , never - quite - forgotten old flame reunions and ' friends ' who seem to care more about our lives than our partners , have made emotional cheating more possible emotional infidelity was n't part of our grandparents ' consciousness because the only member of the opposite sex available to flirt with was either your best friends ' husband or your husbands ' best friend			1
infidelity rose sharply the second women swelled the workforce and expanded the choice of available extra-marital partners			0
then along came @entity33 and @entity34 , and with it ' harmless ' online flirtations , never - quite - forgotten old flame reunions ( ' it 's just a coffee ' ) and ' friends ' who seem to care more about our lives than our partners			2
it 's no wonder the lines of infidelity have blurred into a messy blob with which @entity68 would have had a heyday			0
intense but invisible , erotic but unconsumed - emotional infidelity is dangerous , addictive and way too easy to get away with			2
with such blurry boundaries , it 's hard to know what 's acceptable and what 's not			0

@entity0 *blames* @entity33 and @entity34 for ' emotional affairs '
emotional infidelity is intense , erotic , addictive and easy to get away with
eight questions to see if you are being emotionally unfaithful
do you talk *negatively* about your partner to a ' special ' friend ? you 're *effectively* saying ' i could be lured away from this relationship because it 's not ideal ' .
do you act available ? the more you talk about your partner to others , the less available you 'll seem . *conveniently* forget to *mention* you 're involved with someone and people will react to you as though you 're single .
do you have one rule for you , one rule for them ? we all want our cake and to eat it too though we justify this by saying if we 're flirting with someone , we know it 's **innocent** . we 're also very good at *deluding* ourselves something 's **innocent** when it 's not .
do you *regularly* *indulge* in sexual fantasies about someone else ? i do n't actually think there 's anything *intrinsically* wrong with being unfaithful in your head , but some *experts* say fantasy sex can make you want the person even more . the whole point of fantasies , after all , is to *conjure* up *brilliantly* *perfect* sex !
do you keep *secrets* ? do you have secret email *accounts* , *passwords* and a lock on your *phone* ? in an open , *honest* relationship , ideally no *communication* should be secret .
do you share intimate details of your life with people you fancy ? it 's one thing dissecting and analyzing your relationships with same sex friends ( or opposite sex friends if you 're gay ) but quite another discussing deeply personal things with someone you 've got a ' thing ' for . emotional *closeness* *swiftly* moves into romantic *dependence* .
are you *female* ? it tends to be the woman who pushes the affair from friendship to love , from fantasy to actuality , according to *psychologists* . women get more emotionally involved and are keen to test it out , to see if this could be better than her current situation .
do you ***lie*** to your partner about seeing other people ? if your partner 's *feeling* a little *threatened* by the amount of time you 're spending with your new best ' friend ' , do you *continue* seeing them and ***lie*** ? a good question to ask to keep you on the *straight* and *narrow* : if my partner saw me right now , would they be upset ? would you be *tempted* to ***lie*** about what you 're doing ? if yes , stop it !
