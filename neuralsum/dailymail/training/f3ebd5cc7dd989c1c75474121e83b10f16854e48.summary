by @entity0 , @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity3 published : 03:30 est , 25 april 2013 updated : 18:47 est , 25 april 2013 @entity4 was warned economic recovery will be a ‘ marathon , not a sprint ’ yesterday as official figures showed an unprecedented triple dip recession has been avoided			1
in a significant boost for chancellor @entity12 , gross domestic product grew by 0.3 per cent in the first quarter of the year			1
the figure is far better than expected and comes in spite of the unseasonably cold weather , which helped depress retail sales and construction			2
the economy grew by 0.3 per cent in the first three months of 2013 , avoiding the third recession since 2008 , the @entity19 said mr @entity12 , pictured today , has been boosted by news that the economy has grew by 0.3 per cent in the first three months of this year the chancellor used @entity25 to say the figures were proof that the ' economy is healing ' mr @entity12 said ‘ the economy is healing ’ but warned there could be further difficulties ahead			1
he said : ‘ despite a tough economic backdrop , we are making progress			0
‘ the deficit is down by a third , businesses have created over a million and a quarter new jobs , and interest rates are at record lows			0
‘ we all know there are no easy answers to problems built up over many years , and i ca n’t promise the road ahead will always be smooth but by continuing to confront our problems head on , @entity4 is recovering and we are building an economy fit for the future			1
’ between january and @entity46 grew by 0.3 per cent , which is well ahead of the 0.1 per cent rise expected by analysts			1
it was enough to stave off a third recession in five years after the economy shrank by 0.3 per cent in the final three months of 2012			1
the service industries including hotels and transport accounted for most of the growth in the economy , while construction suffered a 2.5 per cent slump business secretary @entity60 said the ' road to recovery would be a marathon , not a sprint ' while deputy prime minister @entity65 insisted the economy was not out of the woods yet a recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of decline and @entity4 has suffered two since the financial crisis struck – the first in 2008 - 09 and the second in 2011 - 12			1
growth was driven by the dominant services sector , a bounce - back in @entity79 oil and gas production , and soaring demand for energy , as households turned up the heating during the cold snap			0
output from services firms – which range from hairdressers and hotels to accountants and train operators – rose 0.6 per cent			0
industrial production rose 0.2 per cent , thanks largely to a 3.2 per cent increase in ‘ mining and quarrying ’ as @entity79 production recovered from extended maintenance work on crucial oil rigs at the end of last year			0
meanwhile the energy supply sector rose 0.5 per cent			0
but factory output fell 0.3 per cent and construction was down 2.5 per cent as vast swathes of the economy remained firmly in recession			1
it also appears increasingly likely that the @entity19 will revise away last year ’s ‘ double dip ’ recession			0
the change in @entity46 in the last quarter of 2011 was recently revised from minus 0.4 per cent to minus 0.1 per cent – and further amendments are expected , particularly to the first quarter of 2012 , which was also just minus 0.1 per cent			0
@entity112 dem business secretary @entity60 said that the growth was ‘ modestly encouraging ’ but added that the recovery was a ‘ marathon , not a sprint ’			2
the government was hit by the news that an extra 70,000 were unemployed in the first three months of 2013 meanwhile , shadow chancellor @entity119 made the startling claim that the deficit had only fallen because of the ‘ inheritance ’ left by the @entity124 government			2
he added : ‘ these lacklustre figures show our economy is only just back to where it was six months ago ... if we ’re to have a strong and sustained recovery we need urgent action to kickstart our economy and strengthen it for the long - term			2
’ @entity134 , a @entity124 mp on the @entity135 , claimed the figures confirmed ‘ the @entity137 - isation of the @entity4 economy ’			1
latest figures reveal how government borrowing remains stubbornly high at £ 120.6billion in 2012 - 13 , down just £ 300million on the year before he said : ‘ in @entity137 , the economy stagnated			1
sometimes it went down to below zero , sometimes just above it but it kept on this very low - growth trend and kept there for 15 years			2
‘ we are in the same cycle and breaking out of it will need a change of policy			0
’ weak growth has pushed mr @entity12 ’s plans to cut the record deficit racked up by @entity124 off course , and borrowing fell by just £ 300million to £ 120.6billion last year			1
@entity155 mps @entity154 ( left ) and @entity156 accused the chancellor of being timid and complacent about the need for bold action to secure strong economic growth but the return to growth will have come as a huge relief to the @entity164 just days after @entity4 suffered another downgrade to its aaa credit rating , this time by ratings agency @entity167 , and the chancellor was criticised by the @entity168			1
@entity168 chief economist @entity169 said mr @entity12 was ‘ playing with fire ’ by pressing ahead with austerity while the economy was so weak			1
now the chancellor ’s position will be bolstered as he prepares to defy any formal recommendations from the @entity168 to change course			2
@entity176 , an economist at banking group @entity177 , said the figures were ‘ one in the eye ’ for the @entity168 and the ratings agencies			2
of the major economies listed in the @entity168 's @entity182 , the prediction of 0.7 per cent growth for 2013 puts the @entity4 well below the @entity185 , @entity186 , @entity137 and much of @entity187 the unrelenting gloom over @entity4 ’s economic prospects has lifted , with growth making an unexpectedly bright reappearance in the first three months of the year			1
timing could not be better for @entity12 ahead of what had promised to be a bruising encounter with the examiners from the @entity168 , who are due in @entity197 early in may			1
the 0.3 per cent lift in output , after a decline in the final months of last year , was described as ‘ lacklustre ’ by the chancellor ’s critics on the @entity124 benches			2
but it does mean that the fearful vision of a triple dip , so avidly discussed by broadcasters ahead of the data being published , has been vanquished			0
indeed , revisions to past data suggest the double dip – two successive downturns in the economy since a peak in 2008 – will also turn out to have been a fiction			0
this does not mean @entity4 is in the midst of a storming upturn			0
but what is absolutely clear is parts of the economy are , with the help of the shock treatment of record low interest rates , back to where they were before the ‘ @entity227 ’ of 2009 - 10			0
behind the emerging recovery is a sharp bounce back in the services sector , which includes everything from the high street to financial services and creative industries , and comprises some 80 per cent of the nation ’s output			0
@entity168 ( @entity168 ) managing director @entity237 suggested mr @entity12 should consider changing the pace of his deficit reduction programme it is now 1.5 per cent higher than a year ago and has fully recovered from the trough of the recession			1
the buoyancy of services is one of the reasons some 500,000 new private sector jobs have been created in @entity4 over the past year			0
unfortunately for the chancellor , his desire to rebalance the @entity4 economy back to manufacturing and exports is not going so well			2
manufacturing remains deep in the doldrums , despite a sharp devaluation of the pound that was meant to help exports			0
the depression in manufacturing can largely be blamed on the disastrous conditions in the eurozone , with unemployment in @entity263 surging to an incredible 27 per cent			0
construction is also disappointing , partly because of the exceptionally cold winter weather than dragged on for months			0
however total industrial output is on the mend , largely as a result of greater output from @entity79 oil and gas that was sharply down late last year			0
the chancellor had expected a difficult encounter with the @entity168 team			2
the @entity168 ’s top economist , @entity169 , has argued publicly that @entity4 is ‘ playing with fire ’ with its continuing austerity measures			1
the latest numbers suggest that even with our biggest trading partner in the eurozone mired in chaos the @entity4 economy is still capable of expanding , if not at the pace the government would like to see .			1

overall figures better than expected easing pressure on @entity12
economy overall grew by 0.3 **%** but construction slumps by 2.5 **%**
deputy *pm* @entity65 warns : ' we *'re* not out of the woods yet '
@entity124 blames **coalition** for *slowest* recovery for 100 years
government borrowing remains stubbornly high at £ *120billion*
@entity155 @entity300 accuse **coalition** of being ' timid ' and ' complacent ' about growth
@entity168 urged @entity4 to *rethink* pace of cuts in face of *sluggish* recovery
