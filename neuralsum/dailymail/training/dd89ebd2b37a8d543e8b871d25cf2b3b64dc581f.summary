half of adults with autism have been abused by someone they know , a new study has found amid warnings of the ' devastating scale ' of neglect and abuse			1
many people diagnosed with the condition are staying at home because they are afraid of being abused or harrassed , the @entity10 ( @entity10 ) said today			1
people with autism can find it hard to interpret other people 's motivations and as a result can be taken advantage of or manipulated , the charity said			1
half of the 1,300 sufferers questioned by @entity10 said they had been abused by someone they considered a friend			1
a survey by the @entity10 found half of the 1,300 adults surveyed had been abused by someone they considered to be a friend thirty - seven per cent said they had been manipulated to do something they did not want to by these so - called friends , while 44 per cent said fear of abuse or harrassment led them to not wanting to leave the house			1
meanwhile a quarter of those polled said they have had their money or possessions stolen			2
the charity said the survey also revealed many adults with the condition feel they are being neglected			1
two thirds said they require someone to prompt them to wash , dress or feed themselves			2
but seven in 10 of these sufferers said they had missed meals because they do n't get this support while 86 per cent said they had not washed			0
@entity10 raised concerns that changes to the care system could mean this kind of neglect could become more commonplace			1
a spokesman said that the government 's proposals suggest that people will be eligible for care and support if they need ' assistance ' , which may not necessarily include prompting			0
@entity69 , chief executive of @entity10 , said : ' these alarming figures paint a depressing picture of the horrendous abuse and neglect experienced by many adults with autism			1
' we have heard deeply distressing stories of men and women living in utterly intolerable conditions , exploited physically and financially by supposed friends or unable to care for themselves without support			0
' one professional told us of a man who had been found at home suffering from severe malnutrition and with mould growing on his skin as he was unable to feed or clean himself without prompting			0
' this is utterly unacceptable in 21st century @entity89			0
' we know that many people with autism are able to live relatively independent lives , but many others need support to stay safe and healthy			2
' the government 's changes to the care system offer a chance to support these at - risk individuals			0
the research also discovered many adults with the condition feel they are being neglected			2
the charity warned of the ' devastating scale ' of abuse and neglect ' however , we are incredibly concerned that the current proposals as they stand do not recognise the basic needs of these more vulnerable people with autism			1
' it 's not too late			0
the eligibility criteria must be revised so that they explicitly recognise the support needs of those at risk of abuse and neglect and protect some of the most vulnerable people in society			1
' a @entity120 spokeswoman said : ' until now it 's been hard for people who need care and their carers to know if they are eligible for care and support from their council and this has varied depending on where they live			0
' our national eligibility criteria will make the system fairer by clearly setting out what level of needs must be met by all local authorities , putting an end to this variation			0
' these alarming figures paint a depressing picture of the horrendous abuse and neglect experienced by many adults with autism ' - @entity69 , chief executive of the @entity10 ' this consultation makes it clear that people with autism , whatever their level of need , will receive help from their councils			1
' those with lower needs will receive information and advice on what services and support are available locally to help them			0
' and our minimum £ 3.8 billion @entity160 to join up health and social care will focus on helping people to live independently and prevent them from needing more support in the first place			0
' the @entity10 added : ' the government ’s draft regulations would provide national criteria for all local authorities which will be helpful , but our over-riding concern is their failure to provide the necessary clarity about who local authorities should support			2
' they do not explicitly commit to supporting those people with autism who are at risk of abuse and neglect			1
their eligibility for support must be made clear , otherwise local authorities will be able to interpret the criteria as they see fit			0
' these vulnerable individuals do not have ‘ lower needs ’			0
the people who responded to our survey had terrible experiences ; in the most concerning cases , this neglect and abuse had spiralled out of control and ultimately led to death			1
‘ information and advice alone will not be enough to protect these at - risk individuals falling into crisis			0
' local authorities must be obliged to provide the direct support we know people with autism need in the first instance to stay safe and healthy			2
