we have read your character references , including the one from your church			2
' we note you are involved with the church and you will therefore be aware that marriage is a solemn vow			0
' however we are going to go with the recommendation in the report and so you will complete 150 hours of unpaid work			0
' @entity79 , defending , said : ' mr @entity0 has previous good character and he did plead guilty at the earliest opportunity , something which he should get credit for			2
' he pleaded guilty because he accepts that he did not see or sign any paperwork to say that the marriage was null or void			0
' there was no financial gain to marry and this was not for immigration purposes			0
in that regard , i think this brings down the severity of the case			0
' the pair organised a lavish ceremony at @entity46 in @entity13 in october 2008 lack later told police he did not think his second marriage , in @entity4 , was real and his defence team said he thought his @entity4 wife had ' sorted ' their divorce she added : ' he has been extremely distressed about this , especially with the hype the case has received in the media			1
' he is a gentleman who is working			0
he is an educated gentleman			0
he is a member of the church			0
he is doing great things in the community			0
' i think it is fair to say that mr @entity0 realises he will be punished for this offence			2
' the risk of re-offending is low and he is not a harm to the public			0
i would suggest that mr @entity0 is not someone you will see here in court again			2
