miss @entity12 , 37 , said that doctors had ‘ dismissed ’ her concerns that her baby had meningitis and sent them home from hospital			1
@entity19 - with her mother @entity20 - died from meningitis after doctors at @entity23 repeatedly ruled out the fact she had the condition - insisting she simply had a virus missed opportunities to appropriately care for @entity11 amounted to neglect , inquest heard			1
her mother said : ' we always think " what if ? " they should have given my child the care she needed			1
i 'll never understand the reasons why ' the worried mother , who had even brought a checklist of common symptoms of meningitis to the hospital , said the doctors made her feel like an ‘ overly - protective parent ’			1
they told her it was ‘ just a virus ’ and advised her simply to give her calpol and ibuprofen			1
but @entity11 ’s condition worsened and she died six days later , after more blunders by medical staff at @entity23 , the inquest heard			1
the hospital then told the grieving mother there was no need to involve a coroner , but miss @entity12 contacted one herself to expose the truth and the inquest has finally taken place			1
recording a narrative verdict , coroner @entity59 said that doctors ’ inadequate care for @entity11 and the mistakes in treatment amounted to neglect , contributing to her death from multi-organ failure			1
a serious incident report detailed a total of 27 failings by the @entity72 trust			0
on the day she fell ill , @entity11 ( pictured here when healthy ) was listless , pale , had mottled skin and a rash on her chest			0
but her condition was not identified - despite her mother taking a ' meningitis checklist ' she had on her fridge to hospital miss @entity12 said : ' we were made to feel like overly protective parents			1
there was a sense of arrogance from the doctors			2
i did what parents are told to do and i had the checklist of symptoms but no one listened to me ' miss @entity12 , an it manager , said : ‘ if they had listened to me when we first took her in then she would have survived			0
‘ i would say to other parents that you need to trust your instincts			0
doctors do n’t always get it right			2
you have to push every step of the way			0
’ she added : ‘ no one would listen to me			0
we faced blocker after blocker after blocker			0
’ miss @entity12 , of @entity108 , @entity109 , noticed @entity11 ‘ was n’t herself ’ after picking her up from nursery in december 2009			0
she spotted a rash and , recognising it as a possible sign of meningitis from a picture card of symptoms she kept on her fridge , took @entity11 to hospital			2
a report into @entity11 's care found a raft of failings including a failure to act on parental concerns and misdiagnosis ‘ we had to wait for what felt like an age			1
the doctors were really arrogant and i felt they were dismissing my concerns , ’ she said			2
@entity11 was sent home , but miss @entity12 took her back to hospital two days later when she developed an alarmingly high temperature			2
an investigation by @entity135 led to a report recommending 22 changes in paediatric care , which have been implemented doctors again tried to send @entity11 home , but miss @entity12 refused to leave			1

she was eventually admitted to paediatric intensive care the following day			2
blood tests confirmed @entity11 had meningitis two days later on december 16 – the day before she died			1
sadly , by then it was too late to treat her			0

asked if she thought the hospital had tried to cover - up failings , miss @entity12 , who has a four - year - old daughter @entity165 and is now separated from the girls ’ father , said : ‘ they wanted the whole thing to go away and we did n’t			2
