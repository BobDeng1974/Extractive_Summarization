a mother of six has claimed she was threatened with a criminal record for taking her children out of a school for a family holiday			1
@entity6 , 42 , of @entity7 , and her company director husband @entity5 , 49 , wanted to take their six children on a 17 - day trip to @entity11 for their elder son 's bar mitzvah , which they 'd booked soon after he was born 13 years ago			1
she said that while the primary school her younger children attend agreed to let the children take nine days off school for it , staff at the high school attended by her older children warned her she could be prosecuted for aiding truancy			2
the parents informed the teachers at @entity42 by letter a month before the trip and then flew to @entity11 on 17 april with their children @entity35 , 13 , honey , 12 , @entity47 , ten , @entity48 , eight , @entity49 , five , and @entity50 , 13 months			1
she said : ' we did n’t ask permission , we said we are taking this time off for a very significant family occasion and the kids will be missing school on these days			2
' we booked it 13 years ago because that is what you have to do			0
the primary school said it was fine but the high school did n't give us permission			0
' it 's a @entity65 school and they said " ca n't you change the date to out of term - time ? " ' but you ca n't just change the date on something like this - people book years in advance for the ceremony at the @entity74 and travel from all over the world			1
' mrs @entity6 said she received a letter from the school saying their application for a holiday had been turned down , which she said left her ' really offended '			1
' it said we might be subject to fines for not complying			0
we were furious - we were n’t just going on a jolly to @entity84			0
' the trip to @entity37 was for the bar mitzvah of @entity35 , 13 , left , pictured with his ten - year - old brother , @entity47 after the holiday the school wrote to them saying that staff there were within their rights to refer them to the local authority , and prosecution might follow			1
' the fact that a parent faces criminal action because they want to spend time with their children on holiday for a reasonable price is disgusting , ' mrs @entity6 said			1
' how is it justifiable ? ' what the travel companies , airlines and hotels are doing is disgusting and the government is complicit - parents are now priced out of holidays so they are for the elite only			2
' the government should be regulating these companies , not fining hard - working people who want to spend time with their children without it costing an arm and a leg			2
' after the @entity6 family complained to the @entity124 and to the @entity65 press , the school backed down , and did not refer the @entity6 family to the local authority			2
new legislation means that parents who do not ensure their child attends school may be referred to the education welfare officer and fined			0
if fines are not paid , parents can be prosecuted , resulting in a fine of up to £ 2,5000 and up to three months in prison			0
a @entity137 spokesman said : ' evidence shows allowing pupils to regularly miss school can be hugely detrimental to a child 's education			0
' the most recent figures show we are making progress , with 130,000 fewer pupils regularly missing school under this government			0
' @entity149 , head teacher at @entity42 , said : ' we follow the guidance from the @entity137 and the local authority			0
' as such , only in the most exceptional circumstances can an absence in term - time be authorised			1

@entity6 , 42 , and husband @entity5 , 49 , booked family holiday to @entity11
the 17 - day trip meant their children would miss nine days of school term
they booked £ 5,000 holiday in term - time to avoid it costing them £ 10,000
older children 's school said parents would be breaking *law* if they went
mr and mrs @entity6 , of @entity7 , told they faced fine and possible prosecution
but they said : ' parents are priced out of family holidays and the government is complicit '
mosses took their children @entity35 , 13 , honey , 12 , @entity47 , 10 , @entity48 , 8 , @entity49 , 5 , and @entity50 , 13 months , anyway
@entity42 eventually backed down but mrs @entity6 said she was ' furious '
