he later missed a putt			0
they were beaten by @entity9 and @entity11 , aided by the @entity36 senator ’s hole in one on the 11th hole on the golf course at @entity22 in @entity38			1
putting away : @entity40 president @entity0 rarely takes politics onto the greens but the @entity43 say he is determined to do ' whatever it takes ' to get his second term agenda through @entity11 hit a five iron 156 yards for a surprise hole in one on the 11th hole			1
the feat was the talk of @entity52 , but the @entity36 @entity53 was modest about the shot			0

if only it was as easy in congress ... but the president has also been criticized for failing to work more closely with the @entity60 and @entity116			0
he has responded in recent months by hosting dinners and lunches with small groups of lawmakers from both parties to try to find common ground on issues			0
@entity11 said the foursome did not discuss immigration reform , a top priority for @entity0 , which begins to wind its way through @entity95 this week			1
@entity11 said the foursome talked ' a little bit ' about the crisis in @entity132 , cybersecurity and fiscal issues			1
