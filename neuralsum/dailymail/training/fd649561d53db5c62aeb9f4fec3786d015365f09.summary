for decades , scientists have tried to perfect methods and analyze data in a bid to predict earthquakes before they happen and potentially save hundreds of thousands of lives			1
however , an author living in @entity8 , @entity6 claims the answers are in plain sight and @entity11 has now written a book about his remarkable findings			1
mr @entity11 , a former science teacher from @entity14 , became interested in earthquakes			1
he was in charge of the emergency preparedness plan at the school where he worked			0
cracking the code : author @entity11 believes he has found the key to accurately predicting when an earthquake will strike and has suggested there is a pattern between them real science ? earthquake prediction has been almost a taboo field of study for the @entity28 ( @entity28 ) , the very governmental agency in charge of making progress in this area , leaving their conservative approach to draw criticism from prominent seismologists worldwide scientists and folklorists have used a dizzying selection of methods and theories trying to make earthquake forecasts for years , with little success			1
animal behavior , changes in the weather , and seismograms have all fallen short			0
scientists first turned to seismology as a predictive tool , hoping to find patterns of foreshocks that might indicate that a fault is about to slip			0
but nobody has been able to reliably distinguish between the waves of energy that herald a great earthquake and harmless rumblings			2
he says he noticed every earthquake happened at dusk or dawn			1
' i realized this sort of conscience does n’t happen in science			2
these dawn and dusk quakes during new and full moons are the paradigm on the west coast , ' he said			1
' all six great quakes that have struck in @entity73 that have killed people since the 30s , all of them , dawn or dusk quakes ' , he told @entity75			1
mr @entity11 says that it is the ' conjoined lunar and solar gravitational tides , ' that causes the quakes			1
' just imagine the muscle required to move our oceans around every day			0
our fractured fault lines are not immune to this power , ' he said			0
the prevailing view has placed seismic forecasting in the realm of near impossibility , but mr @entity11 insists that a number of facts infer quite the opposite			2
the @entity91 is extensively damaged after an earthquake in @entity91 , @entity93 in december 2011 displaced @entity94 walk the streets amid collapsed buildings and rubble in downtown @entity98 , @entity94 in january 2010 january 2010 , @entity94 more than 300,000 die and over a million are displaced following magnitude 7 quake july 1976 , @entity100 officially 242,769 die in 7.5 strike but figure could be more than tripple that december 2004 , @entity105 9.1 earthquake struck here and caused subsequent tsunami in 14 countries			0
nearly 300,000 dead and 1.7m displaced december 1920 , @entity100 a magnitude 7 quake which killed 200,000 september 1923 , @entity112 extreme destruction and 142,800 dead in @entity113 his book presents a persuasive and open - minded inquiry into compelling clues and data that have been downplayed or ignored for almost two centuries , connecting hundreds of scientific studies with a stunning series of historic seismic events on the @entity123 during the 20th century			0
remarkable evidence gives a thought - provoking overview of how this topic has remained in scientific limbo for so many centuries , culminating in a list of hours - long higher probability windows for seismicity into the future			2
mr @entity11 lists the plain spoken reasons how and why it should be realized that it is plausible , with some degree of accuracy , to forecast the next ground - shaking catastrophe			1
mr @entity11 says that there has never been a new idea in science that was n’t accepted without a fight and claims the next earthquake will happen on july 12 and september 9 , between 4:45 to 7:55 a.m. or p.m. in his book , mr @entity11 lists every tremor powerful enough to have caused fatalities within a 70 mile radius of @entity73 ' city center , struck @entity14 between 1933 and 1994			1
he states that every one of them occurred either within a tight 3 hour window at dawn or a corresponding time interval at dusk			2
two thirds of those events also took place not only either at dawn or dusk , but within 36 hours of the precise instant of new or full moon phases			1
pattern : two thirds of recent earthquake events took place not only either at dawn or dusk , but within 36 hours of the new or full moon phases findings : @entity11 , who spent 20 years as a junior high instructor in @entity14 , believes the forces of gravity and where the sun and moon are could determine large temblors the great quakes on the @entity173 @entity123 north of @entity14 also fit this historic pattern			1
the @entity175 ( 1906 ) clocked in at 5:12 am ; @entity176 ( 1989 ) struck almost precisely 12 hours later : 5:04 pm			0
@entity177 was destroyed on @entity178 , 1964 at 5:36 pm -- 47 minutes away from the exact moment when the @entity180 entered the greatest extent of it 's fullness			0
the last @entity183 on the @entity184 ( 1857 ) hit @entity185 in the early morning			0
the may 2 , 1996 magnitude 5.4 @entity188 earthquake , the largest in that city ’s history since 1965 , rocked the @entity192 area no more than 9 minutes outside the time and date forecasted in @entity11 ’s first book			1
mr @entity11 suggests there is fairly solid evidence to support the hypothesis that solar and lunar tides working in tandem might actually have a hand in at least helping to trigger tremors on the @entity123			2
however , @entity28 seismologist @entity203 is more wary about predicting such earthquakes			1
' there ’s a very slight correlation			0
not enough to predict any earthquake out of it , ' she told @entity75 @entity73 said			0
' people try to make patterns out of anything that scares them			0
we have n’t found anything that looks different before a big earthquake than other times			0
we get enough people sending us predictions			0
the slug trail lady who used to go out in her driveway and map out the slug trails in the morning and use that to predict where the next earthquake was going to happen			2
' asked about earthquake weather , @entity225 said , ' the reality is earthquakes happen 5 to 10 miles deep in the earth and surface weather does n’t affect anything at that depth			1
' asked what causes a quake to start and stop , she said , ' i do n’t know			0
we have figured out that earthquakes are happening at much lower stresses , and now we ’re trying to understand the mechanisms that let them happen			2

@entity11 claims there is a pattern as to when earthquakes occur and that they can be predicted
quakes happen during either a full or new moon - and within three hours of dawn or dusk
earthquake prediction has been almost a taboo field of study for the @entity28 and say such findings are *nonsense*
