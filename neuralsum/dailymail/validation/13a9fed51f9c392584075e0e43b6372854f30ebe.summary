but the celebration quickly sour as @entity0 became ' melancholy ' , complaining that her husband was still in @entity7 and a current boyfriend was also away , the court heard			2
after a row broke out , @entity0 armed herself with a 30 - inch kitchen knife and stabbed mr @entity27 to the chest			1
the knife thrust 10cm downwards from his neck into his chest cavity narrowly missing his vital organs			1
mr @entity27 was rushed to hospital and was saved by doctors , being left with a 12 - inch scar			2
@entity0 later told police @entity27 had started hitting his partner after a few drinks and she had intervened			0
she claimed that she had only picked up the knife to defend herself but admitted she had been ' waving it around '			2
she said she later saw blood on the knife but does not know what happened to it			0
the knife was never recovered			0
mr @entity27 said in a statement that the attack had a ' significant impact ' upon him			0

@entity0 was jailed for two years this week after she was found guilty of wounding mr @entity27			1
passing sentence , judge @entity74 said : ' this incident arose out of a dispute initially between the victim and his girlfriend , he was violent towards his girlfriend			1
' i accept that he was violent towards you and he subjected you to a significant attack which caused extensive bruising to your body			0
i have seen the photos and i sentence you on the basis that it was the victim who caused the injuries to you			0
' but the jury 's verdict means that you then picked up a kitchen knife and stabbed him in a downward motion to the neck quite deliberately			0
' the knife went in some 10 cm down towards the chest cavity			0
fortunately for him and for you the knife did not touch any vital organs			0
' nonetheless he is left with a serious wound partly caused by the knife and partly by the surgery and although he started the incident by attacking his girlfriend and you , it is clear that he is still , as a result of what you did to him , has significant problems both with his employment and his general life			0
' the attack happened after @entity0 invited the victim and his girlfriend to her home in @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity4 , @entity5 the judge added : ' despite what he has done , you caused that dreadful injury			1
you are 39 years of age , you have lived in the @entity11 for not too long			1
' it 's clear that you have something of a turbulent life , you have convictions in @entity7 for violence - there are not a lot of details but enough so i am able to conclude that you are no stranger to violence in the past when provoked , perhaps			1
' your account in the trial was in affect , that the victim sustained his injuries by accident when you were waving the knife around - an account which the jury rejected			2
the injury you have caused is so serious that only an immediate custodial sentence can be justified			0
' the @entity146 investigates cases of @entity149 citizens who commit crimes in @entity11 before deciding whether to bring deportation proceedings			2
offenders who are given a sentence of 12 months or more are usually recommended for deportation			0
@entity11 border controls are dependent on other countries sharing information about their citizens ' criminal pasts with them , a system which has led to many foreign criminals slipping into @entity11 , including @entity162 , the @entity163 killer believed to have murdered west @entity165 schoolgirl @entity164 .			2
