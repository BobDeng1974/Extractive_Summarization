@entity0 scored a hat - trick against @entity2 to keep @entity4 's @entity3 hopes alive			2
before @entity6 's last - gasp equaliser against @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity4 were staring another group stage exit in the face , and looked likely to need to need a win against @entity2 just to stay in the competition			1
fortunately for @entity14 's side , @entity6 equalised , and @entity0 's last - gasp winner for @entity4 means that three teams in @entity17 are level on five points			0
@entity2 are on 12 and safely through as group winners , but for @entity7 , @entity6 and @entity4 , it comes down to matchday six			2
it 's all to play for , and any of them could make it through to the knock - out stages			0
here , @entity24 explains exactly what the situation is ... @entity0 scored a 91st minute winner against @entity2 to keep @entity4 in the qualification mix @entity6 's late equaliser against @entity7 did themselves , and @entity4 , a favour what we know ... are you with us so far ... ? here 's where it gets tricky ... if @entity6 lose and @entity4 draw , it goes to a head - to - head battle between @entity4 and @entity7 â€” their game at the @entity41 finished 1 - 1			1
@entity0 celebrates after his important third goal against @entity2 at the @entity41 on tuesday @entity43 proud of @entity4 fightback			0

@entity6 did @entity4 a favour with their draw against @entity7
@entity4 stole three points from @entity2 at the death
now , @entity2 are through , while the other three teams are *joint*
@entity4 , @entity7 and @entity6 all have five points with one game left
if @entity6 lose to @entity2 and @entity4 beat @entity7 , @entity4 go through
if @entity6 draw and @entity4 win , then @entity4 also go through
if @entity6 draw and @entity4 draw , then @entity4 are out **due** to @entity6 's **superior** head - to - head ***record*** against @entity4 .
if @entity6 win in @entity63 , @entity4 are out , again **due** to @entity6 's head - to - head ***record***
if @entity4 lose in @entity66 , @entity4 are out and @entity7 are through
if the teams draw 0 - 0 , then @entity7 would go through based on their better head - to - head away goals ***record***
if the teams draw 1 - 1 , they will finish on identical head - to - head ***record***s so @entity4 go through on their **superior** goal *difference* in the group
if the teams draw 3 - 3 or *higher* , @entity4 go through
