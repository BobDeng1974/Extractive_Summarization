' the heavyweight , who won @entity7 gold in 2000 , has not fought since he was knocked out by @entity8 @entity8 inflicted a first - round defeat on @entity0 in 2013 which led to his retirement before he went back on it @entity0 initially retired following his first - round defeat by @entity8 , who is now the @entity74 world champion			1
but he reversed that decision within days as he struggled to accept his career was over			0

the 43 - year - old currently lives in @entity81 and added : ' i 've made many mistakes and learned some tough lessons along the way			2
i made tons of money and splurged lots of it away with reckless money management , immaturity and a desire to build my empire like @entity94			2

the hefty tax bill each year does not finish until 2022			0
' @entity0 started boxing at 19 and became the first @entity79 boxer to win @entity7 gold in the super-heavyweight division when he triumphed in @entity100			1
his triumph paved the way for future medalists @entity122 , @entity17 , @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125 through increased funding			0
he turned professional the following year , signing a Â£ 1million deal with the @entity128 for his first 10 fights			0
six million people watched his debut - a first round knockout of @entity133 - but his contract was terminated in 2004 after he had accumulated a record of 17 wins from as many contests			0
@entity0 suffered his first defeat when he challenged @entity139 for the vacant @entity141 title			1
although he would later avenge that loss , it was the first of several high - profile bouts in which @entity0 failed to produce the goods			1
@entity146 knocked him out in the third round of their @entity30 title clash - although that defeat was also avenged three years later in a rematch for the same belt			0
@entity0 twice used the short - format @entity153 to his advantage , first in 2009 when he defeated @entity155 , @entity156 and @entity157			1
that propelled him into his second clash with @entity146 which saw him finally win a major honour			0
the world title opportunity he so craved arrived in 2010 when he challenged @entity162 for his @entity164 strap in @entity165			0
six million people watched @entity0 's professional debut - a first - round win over @entity133 on the @entity128 but @entity0 landed just one punch as he was dismantled inside three farcical rounds			1
the @entity170 initially withheld some of his purse while a full investigation was carried out but he was later awarded the full amount			0
after 18 months in the doldrums , @entity0 made a comeback against @entity177 in 2012 , a bout he won with a fourth - round knockout			1
and once again he earned himself a high - profile fight , this time against the @entity79 and @entity141 champion @entity181			1
@entity0 gets revenge over @entity139 for the @entity141 title in 2006 after earlier losing out to him but yet again , he was unable to walk the walk as the @entity186 giant knocked @entity0 out cold after just 82 seconds			1
those who urged him to retire were left disappointed when he again turned to @entity153 for redemption in 2013			0
and his three victories over @entity190 , @entity191 and @entity192 produced his familiar rhetoric of finally being at one with himself and the sport			0
@entity0 landed just one punch on @entity162 as he was dismantled inside three farcical rounds but in @entity8 he faced another hurdle that could not be overcome			2
the @entity199 hope had knocked out all 27 of his previous opponents added another notch to his record when his right hand sent @entity0 to the canvas for one last time after just 70 seconds			2
@entity0 plans to start an agency to ensure boxers are given the financial advice he appears to have missed out on			2
he also intends to take out a trainer 's license in @entity81 in a bid to develop a future champion			0
he said : ' if i 'm to achieve my goal of becoming a world champion it will now have to be as a trainer and manager to a bright young star , who will hopefully learn from my mistakes , rather than learning from his or her own			0
