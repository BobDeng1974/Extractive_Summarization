the latest version of @entity3 ’s @entity2 operating system , dubbed ‘ @entity4 ’ , has been revealed			1
in a video , the new software is shown running on a @entity7 and it highlights some of the system 's new features including lock - screen notifications and non-invasive alerts			1
no official release date for @entity2 l - rumoured to stand for @entity13 but also possibly @entity14 - has been announced yet , but it is expected to be unveiled later this month			1
the software is shown running on the @entity7 using @entity24 's @entity23			1
@entity4 stops alerts such as phone calls from taking up the whole screen the test build version of @entity2 l was revealed by @entity30			1
in the video , the site explores the app and shows off some of its various functionality			0
each phone operator has their own slightly tweaked version of @entity2 - with @entity24 ’s being called @entity23 - but this video still reveals some of the features users can look forward to			1
@entity3 has announced its next - generation @entity2 software will prevent law enforcement officers and governments getting their hands on user information			2
only people with passwords or passcodes for devices running @entity2 l will be able to access the files on it			0
this means that if search warrants are served on @entity3 for the customer 's information , it wo n't legally be able to get hold of it			2
@entity3 began adding encryption tools to devices in 2011 and it was a standard feature of @entity61			0
however , the tool was optional and many users either did n’t know how to enable the feature , or were n’t aware it existed			0
any devices that upgrade to @entity4 next month will have this tool turned on by default			2
for starters , @entity24 has done away with the blue background it previously used on its phones , instead now preferring white backgrounds			2
this seems slightly odd as lighter backgrounds use more power and thus drain more battery than darker ones - something @entity4 is attempting to improve , reports @entity79			0
pulling down with two fingers on the screen now opens up a menu of shortcuts , and holding one will take you to that settings menu - such as the @entity87 screen			0
and as mentioned earlier , the lock screen now displays notifications such as messages and missed calls - but at the expense of widgets on previous versions of @entity2			1
@entity3 has also redesigned the look of the operating system , which it calls @entity97			1
this includes a new look for @entity100 and more			0
and another interesting new feature is heads - up notifications , which means that alerts no longer take up the whole screen			2
known as @entity4 - which may stand for @entity13 or even @entity14 - the software is the successor to @entity107 used on current phones like the @entity7 ( shown )			1
@entity3 is rumoured to be gearing up to release @entity2 l later this month so , for example , if you ’re playing a game and someone calls you , or your clock alarm goes off , an alert will appear at the top of the screen rather than covering the playing area			1
the clipboard has also been updated , and now keeps a history of saved screenshots and copied text			0
@entity124 support for cars has also been brought in as well , allowing users to mirror the screen of their device on their car ’s display			0
@entity30 add that the test version is still in its alpha stage , so it does n’t run entirely smoothly , and there are a number of glitches to iron out before it 's released .			0
