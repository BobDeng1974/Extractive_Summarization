@entity0 has been told that he can stay in @entity1 even if he loses the election while other parties try to piece together a coalition			1
he will remain prime minister until an alternative is found , and ministers who lose their seats could continue to serve in a caretaker government for weeks			1
sir @entity10 , the country 's top civil servant , insisted that mr @entity0 must remain in @entity12 until there can be a ' smooth transition ' to a new government			1
@entity0 will remain prime minister until an alternative is found , and ministers who lose their seats could continue to serve in a caretaker government for weeks in 2010 , @entity20 was accused of ' squatting ' in @entity1 while the @entity22 and @entity23 negotiated the details of their coalition pact			1
but sir @entity10 , the cabinet secretary , insisted that it was the right thing to do to ensure the wheels of government kept turning			1
five years ago the coalition deal was agreed in just five days , but with a hung parliament likely again , it is expected that any power - sharing agreement could take much longer , possibly even several weeks			0
sir @entity10 told the @entity33 : ' the reality is what @entity20 did last time i think was generally applauded , not in every single quarter			0
' but the idea that you would stay in @entity1 until it was pretty clear who would be better placed than you to form another government , that 's what he did , that 's what happened and we ended up with a very smooth transition			0
' i would certainly urge a future prime minister in the same position to adopt a similar approach			0
' sir @entity10 , the country 's top civil servant , insisted that mr @entity0 must remain in @entity12 until there can be a ' smooth transition ' to a new government polls suggest both @entity56 and the @entity22 will fall short of securing an overall majority at the general election on may 7			1
with the @entity60 on the rise in @entity62 , the @entity23 defending 57 seats and @entity64 predicting they will win more than 10 seats , it is possible that no two parties would be able to form a majority			0
a coalition deal between three or more parties would take much longer to agree , and could prove unstable			0
sir @entity10 added : ' i think it would be very unfair , particularly if it took slightly longer next time than just the five days it took last time , it would be very unfair if the incumbent prime minister was criticised for staying around in @entity1 when he was simply doing what most people would regard as the expectation placed upon him			2
' in 2010 , @entity20 was accused of ' squatting ' in @entity1 while the @entity22 and @entity23 negotiated the details of their coalition pact sir @entity10 said it would be a ' bad mistake to drag ' the queen into any decisions or negotiations that would need to be taken if no party has a clear majority after the election , even if there if two coalitions were formed of equal numbers , telling the committee it was a decision for politicians			2
asked if the ministers who have been kicked out by voters would be able to remain part of a caretaker government , he replied : ' yes , they can '			2
sir @entity10 told the committee he has talked to @entity0 about the role of the civil service during any coalition negotiations after may 7			1
' i have discussed it with the prime minister and he is agreed in principle that the civil service should play the same role in 2015 , if it is needed , as was played in 2010 but we have n't yet got into any detail , ' he said			0
@entity56 , the conservatives and the @entity23 have all introduced new processes since the last election to take factor in the possibility of a hung parliament .			0
