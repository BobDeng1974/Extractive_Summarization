by @entity0 published : 05:10 est , 27 may 2013 updated : 17:58 est , 27 may 2013 when radio legend @entity3 died in 2011 , his partner of five years grieved for him ... and then for their relationship			1
what his girlfriend @entity6 thought was an honest partnership was revealed to be a sham as the reality that he was still with his wife surfaced shortly after his passing			1
@entity15 , 53 , who composed tv theme tunes for have i got news for you and @entity20 earned the nickname @entity3 , died after suffering a massive heart attack following taking the party drug mephedrone			1
an affair to remember : when @entity28 ( pictured ) died , the extent of his double life was revealed the father - of - four from @entity30 , @entity31 , was found struggling for breath at his home by his wife , @entity34 in may 2011 and was pronounced dead when paramedics arrived			1
a statement on the family website after his death said : ' our hearts go out to all those who share our loss			0
' what nobody was aware of , though , was that @entity3 had been living a double life , betraying the two women closest to him			1
as far as @entity48 at the @entity47 radio show presenter @entity6 was concerned , he was separated and they were an official , public celebrity couple together			2
but then she found out he had n't left his wife and had been living a double life throughout their relationship			1
the couple met at @entity58 and bonded over a mutual love of animals and the arts , and , after much convincing , @entity6 felt assured that while @entity3 lived in the family home he and his wife were living separate lives			1
@entity64 and @entity6 at @entity65 where 300 turned out to celebrate @entity3 's life the couple even got two dogs together , nicknamed their ' furkids '			1
@entity6 admits this brought out maternal feelings she never thought she had			2
@entity3 had convinced @entity6 he and his ' estranged ' wife were not together and only crossed paths when he was visiting his children and grandchildren			2
but @entity3 had been staying with wife @entity34 with whom he was still very much together all along - and in fact @entity6 had been the other woman			1
for @entity6 , being labelled as the other woman immediately devalued her as his partner and - most devastatingly - devalued her allowance to grieve			2
their relationship was effectively erased from his past			0
talking to @entity83 , @entity6 said : ' there 's an aspect [ to grieving ] i 'd never thought about until i lost my own soulmate - that there 's some sort of scale of mourning and loss , and that one person 's grief has more importance than another 's			0
' i 'd been a mistress for five years - even though i did n't know it - so when my beloved @entity3 died , my grief was of less value than that of his late wife , ' and so she felt she was not allowed to express her sadness like any loving partner should			1
after his passing when the family home was emptied by relatives and @entity6 was not contacted once , @entity3 's real situation became clear			0
' i discovered @entity3 had left his locker at work open			0
inside i found an envelope filled with hundreds of photos ... every one he 'd taken of us and put up in the flat , ' she says of discovering yet another relic of his betrayal			0
while @entity6 did n't attend his official funeral out of respect for his family , she did join @entity64 and 300 others on the steps of @entity65 next to @entity121 to celebrate @entity3 's life			2
@entity6 still has unanswered questions			0
she said : ' now i have nothing but memories and a few treasured photos of the man who was my life for five years			0
i could have coped with being a mistress			0
i believed his " separate lives " story , but had i discovered the truth when he was still alive i would have shared him			0
