by @entity0 as @entity4 roared over the finish line at @entity6 on thursday night , the capture of a second @entity3 silver medal was not the only hurdle she had successfully cleared			1
as she raced off on her lap of honour , the @entity3 ’ poster - girl from @entity11 could also delight in having fulfilled the expectations of a nation with a taste for glory following eight days of unprecedented success			1
delight in the knowledge that her run had delivered @entity21 ’s record return on the track for a generation			2
but , perhaps more importantly , the 27 - year - old could tick off another box on her wedding plan			1
child is set to tie the knot with her fiance @entity29 in october next year , but the couple had put preparations for their nuptials on hold during training for @entity35			1
@entity36 : @entity21 's @entity4 wins 400m hurdles silver on home soil at the @entity3 in @entity35 amazed : child puts her hands over her mouth in shock as she claims a silver medal at @entity6 emotional : @entity6 rose to cheer home favourite child home in the 400m hurdles final on thursday embrace : child hugs her supporters after claiming silver medal in the 400m hurdles final in @entity35 one idea they had mooted was to name the tables at the wedding reception after athletics stadiums			1
now , after confirming her seat at the @entity3 ’ top table , child is ready to make @entity6 the centrepiece of her ceremony			1
‘ we ’re getting married in october next year			2
the only thing that we can confirm now is that we are going to do different stadiums as the table names , ’ the athlete beamed			2
‘ @entity35 was going to be one of them , but if the race did n’t go the way i wanted , i did n’t want to be reminded of it ! now @entity35 can be the head table ! ’ it was a night which is already being commemorated in the streets of @entity35			0
many are embracing @entity21 ’s triumphs by donning traffic cones beneath the @entity81 statue — the duke ’s own hat gleaming with gold once more			1
hundreds lined the streets of the @entity87 yesterday afternoon as their silver star showed off her prize atop the @entity90 — one little girl was overheard begging her mother : ' @entity93 be there ? ' streaming clear : child was comfortably ahead of the bronze medal position in the final of the 400m hurdles hurdling : child looks focused as she makes her way around the track during the 400m hurdles final one place she wo n’t be is back on the track tonight			1
the former - @entity106 teacher elected to sit out yesterday ’s 4x400metres relay heats , but her younger team - mates ’ fourth - place finish was n’t enough to give child one last @entity6 hurrah			1
‘ it ’s quite a young , new team , ’ she said , ahead of the race			1
‘ they asked me if i wanted to run the heat but i took a step back , and said it would be really nice for the four girls who have not raced at the championships yet to go out and run			0
‘ @entity119 and i are the other members of the team , so we ’ve already been out there and seen that crowd			0
it ’s great for all @entity21 athletes to appreciate that crowd			0
’ although the relay girls will not be appearing on the podium , @entity110 is tipping the rest of @entity131 ’s athletes to add to their best medal haul on the track since their five in @entity134 in 1990			2
‘ it ’s brilliant , because we ’ve only won two medals at each of five @entity139 , ’ she said			0
‘ it ’s great that we ’ve got that monkey off our backs and gone one extra			0
‘ hopefully it does n’t stop with me , hopefully there ’s more medals to come in the next couple of days as well			0
the whole of @entity131 has upped its game and it just shows you what you can do when there ’s a home games with that whole support behind you ’ hugs : child looks on in disbelief having claimed a @entity3 silver medal in the 400m hurdles final patriotic : child walks around the @entity6 track holding a @entity21 @entity162 in her hand after the final after the whirlwind of @entity35 , what next ? one thing ’s for sure , the face of the @entity3 is unlikely to experience the same level of expectation she felt here when she competes on the world stage			1
‘ it ’s really good for me because i ’m probably not going to race on a bigger stage , ’ @entity4 explained			0
‘ i know the @entity139 are not valued the same as the @entity176 , but for me , a home games is about the most pressure i ’m going to have on me at a championships			2
‘ i ’m just happy that i dealt with it in the right way			0
it means that when i go to @entity183 , when i go to the @entity184 , i ’ll be in a better position that what i ’ve been in before			0
i am confident that i will be able to conduct myself well like i ’ve done here			0
‘ i ’ve got about a week until the @entity187 , where i am ranked @entity188			0
hopefully , i can try and get another medal there , but it really depends on how i recover from this			2
‘ i ’ve never really done back - to - back championships before , but hopefully i can come back and do something there as well			0
’ having drunk deep in the euphoria of @entity35 2014 , some might expect child to use the momentum to target an elusive @entity176 medal in two year ’s time			1
having finally shed weeks and months of pressure , she is n’t in a hurry to pile to it all back on			2
‘ i do n’t like to set myself targets because it limits you , ’ child smiled			1
‘ i think i will just see what happens			0
’ adored : child walks around @entity6 and claps the hands of her @entity21 fans after the final			1
