by @entity0 published : 19:49 est , 14 march 2012 updated : 01:42 est , 15 march 2012 a boy who disappeared as a baby had been found eight years later and is set to be returned to his family			2
eight - month - old @entity4 was being cared for by his godmother , @entity5 , at the time of his disappearance in 2004			1
this week @entity8 , 26 , has been arrested on suspicion of kidnapping the boy , now aged eight , and @entity4 has been taken in to the care of @entity10			1
his discovery came as a surprise , since the case was officially abandoned in 2006			1
found : @entity4 , left , went missing in 2004 while being babysat by his godmother @entity5 , right his mother @entity14 has spoken of her joy at @entity4 's re-appearance			1
she told @entity17 : ' right now , i 'm just really anxious to see him , but i know there is a lot of legal stuff i have to do			2
' i want to hold him in my arms and let him know who i am			2
i hope he can feel the same thing i feel for him			2
' ms @entity14 , who has five other children , had fallen on hard times in november 2004 when she asked her close friend @entity8 to look after @entity4 overnight at her apartment in @entity32			1
when she went to pick him up in the morning , they had both gone , and @entity8 's mother claimed they had fled @entity37			0
police investigated the case but were unable to track @entity8 down , and two years later the case was closed			1
however , ms @entity14 says she was never told that authorities were no longer investigating , and found it difficult to get information on the status of the case			2
relief : @entity47 is delighted at the prospect of being reunited with her long - lost son a police spokesman said the case had disappeared from their databases and they did not even know the child 's name			1
' it was very difficult because we were essentially searching for a ghost , ' he said			1
a fresh breakthrough finally came last august , when officials received a complaint about @entity8 , according to @entity64			0
it was reported that she had hit an eight - year - old boy in her care - but child welfare officials were unable to meet with the boy			0
she also apparently gave contradictory answers to officials ' questions , and changed her story about whether or not the child was her own son			0
this prompted the authorities to turn the case over to police , who opened a criminal investigation			1
@entity8 was arrested in @entity82 , 165 miles from @entity32 , earlier this week but was reportedly unco - operative and refused to reveal @entity4 's whereabouts			1
however , yesterday her sister called police and said that the boy was with her , later turning him over to authorities			2
@entity4 is said to be in good health , and will be re-united with his family after his mother takes a dna test proving that he is her son			1
he is believed never to have attended school , and to have been called names like ' dirty ' by @entity8			0
ms @entity14 told @entity95 that her friendship with the alleged kidnapper had made the ordeal even tougher			0
' i knew this family , ' she said			0
' it was n't like , " hey stranger			0
" no , i knew this family			0
i spent time with them			0
we had thanksgivings and @entity106			0
' although the family will seek counselling to ease @entity4 's re-entry into the life from which he was separated as a baby , ms @entity14 is optimistic that he will settle in			1
' we love him very much and we never gave up			0
that 's one thing i would never give up			0

@entity4 was abducted in 2004 when he was eight months old
his godmother @entity5 has been arrested on suspicion of the crime
