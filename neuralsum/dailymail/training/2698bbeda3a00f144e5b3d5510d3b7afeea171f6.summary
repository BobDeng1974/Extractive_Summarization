the @entity1 administration released an outline of its fiscal 2014 budget today promising that the president 's budget ' reduces the deficit and puts the @entity7 on a sound fiscal course			2
' ' every new initiative in the plan is fully paid for , so they do not add a single dime to the deficit , ' the @entity9 pledges			2
an initial walk through the budget proposals released overnight to reporters , however , suggests that republicans in @entity18 will need some convincing			0
the budget will hit congressional offices less than 24 hours after the government 's top watchdog agency declared that nearly $ 100 billion was wasted last year in duplicative and overlapping programs stretching into every corner of the @entity27 bureaucracy			0
' seeing things differently : house speaker @entity36 wo n't like what president @entity1 has to say about the federal budget on wednesday the star attraction of tuesday 's @entity41 hearing on the subject was the tale of three separate government agencies that spend money inspecting catfish , and the annual waste of $ 14 million that goes along with it			1
@entity9 @entity17 in the oversight committee hearing room were not amused			0
and @entity50 budget hawks wo n't be smiling when they read a prominent declaration in the @entity9 's outline that has already been shown to be an exaggeration			2
the budget , it says , ' would achieve $ 1.8 trillion in additional deficit reduction over the next 10 years , bringing total deficit reduction to $ 4.3 trillion			1
this represents more than enough deficit reduction to replace the cuts required by the @entity61 [ on ] sequestration			2
' the implication , one which the @entity9 has made more deliberately in the past , is that @entity1 has already squeezed $ 2.5 trillion out of the government 's next ten deficit statements			1
@entity1 himself said during a press conference on january 14 that he had signed bills into law that contained ' a total of about $ 2.5 trillion in deficit reduction over the past two years			1
' @entity74 , a program of the @entity77 's @entity76 , reported in february that @entity1 's total sum included about $ 600 billion , however , in new taxes - not spending reductions			2
it also included $ 500 billion in reductions of the amount the federal government planned to pay in future interest on its debts			0
only about $ 1.4 trillion consisted of actual spending cuts - or at least what @entity27 wonks call spending cuts			2
president @entity91 's 2004 fiscal year federal budget was a funding request to @entity18 that totaled $ 2.3 trillion			2
this year the government in @entity27 is on pace to spend $ 3.8 trillion , or more than 25 per cent of the value of the entire country 's @entity96 @entity1 on wednesday defended his budget , saying , ' when it comes to deficit reduction , i 've already met @entity17 more than halfway			1
' ' the numbers work			0
there ’s not a lot of smoke and mirrors in here , ' he said in announcing the budget plan from the @entity110			0
' our economy is poised for progress , as long as @entity27 does n’t get in the way , ' he added , calling the budget a ' fiscally responsible blueprint for middle - class jobs and growth			1
' federal budgets are configured along what 's called a ' baseline , ' providing a predetermined level of year - on - year increases that @entity18 has set on auto - pilot , and with which the @entity9 generally considers it unwise to interfere			1
the $ 1.4 trillion in cuts were merely reductions in those planned rates of spending increases			2
the @entity129 quoted house speaker @entity36 's press secretary , @entity130 , who dismissed in an email the idea that the @entity9 's budget will actually trim spending			1
' so where are the net spending cuts ? i guess they do n’t exist , ' @entity130 wrote			0
' the president 's budget will – at best – be flat on spending - or potentially even be a net spending increase [ and ] any deficit reduction will come exclusively from tax hikes			1
' senate minority leader @entity145 practically begged the @entity9 on tuesday to get serious			0
' mr. president , if you are ready to embrace bold reform — to take the steps that are needed to make our entitlement programs permanently solvent and grow the economy — then @entity17 are ready to work with you , ' @entity146 said			0
' the time has come to summon the political courage to move beyond the status quo , to put the tax hikes and the poll - tested gimmicks aside , and to do what must be done			1
' not bosom buddies : senate minority leader @entity145 ( @entity162 ) and majority leader @entity163 ( r ) will have very different takes on @entity1 's budget			0
@entity163 , a @entity165 , controls the @entity167 floor			0
@entity146 , the @entity167 's leading @entity50 , will organize the opposition estimates like the one included in the @entity9 's budget preview are prepared by the @entity171 , which has habitually included projected savings from the @entity174 health care law in its reports			1
the $ 1.8 trillion in new savings promised by the @entity1 @entity9 in tuesday 's embargoed outline include ' $ 400 billion in health savings that build on the health reform law			1
' but @entity181 secretary @entity180 conceded on march 26 that many @entity183 ' health care premiums will increase under the new law , an indication that participation rates may not be at the level the administration wants to see			0
' these folks will be moving into a really fully insured product for the first time , ' the @entity189 quoted @entity180 saying , ' and so there may be a higher cost associated with getting into that market			0
' she admitted tuesday for the first time that the administration also greatly underestimated the complexity of the 2,700 - page law and its accompanying 17,000 pages of regulatory instructions			0
that 's an indication that future @entity174 reports may feature spending overruns - not savings - as the viability of health care exchanges , the administration 's silver - bullet marketplaces that are supposed to drive costs down , are challenged by dozens of state governments that do n't want to participate			1
@entity181 secretary @entity180 , once @entity174 's biggest cheerleader , may be its newest skeptic			2
she said tuesday that the administration was n't prepared for how complex the law 's implementation would become another $ 580 billion of the newly promised $ 1.8 trillion in savings comes from tax increases on upper - income earners , a feature that will make the budget contentious , if not ' dead on arrival , ' in the @entity223			1
the @entity9 characterized it as ' additional revenue relative to the end - of - year tax deal , from tax reform that closes tax loopholes and reduces tax benefits for those who need them least			2
' @entity17 , though , may see the prominence of that mention - it comes first on the @entity9 's list - as a thumbed nose , or a veiled threat of more tax increase demands to come			1
the larger problem for the @entity9 is that @entity1 's promise of $ 580 billion in new tax revenues over ten years is n't nearly large enough to cover the spending bloat that @entity27 insiders continue to acknowledge as a crippling force			1
the public debt now stands at roughly $ 17 trillion , up $ 6 trillion from the debt when @entity1 took office in 2009			0
even if the federal government takes ten years to rack up its next $ 6 trillion in accumulated deficits , the new taxes would contain less than 10 percent of the damage			0
the budget 's most controversial feature may be the adoption of what economists call the ' @entity257 ' measure of inflation , and what the administration referred to as ' using a chained measure of inflation for cost - of - living adjustments			1
' the chained @entity264 signals a shift in how the federal government will calculate everything from @entity269 payouts and congressional pensions to college students ' @entity271 and veterans ' benefits			0
anything tied to cost - of - living increases would be subject to a new formula			1
@entity9 press secretary @entity278 has conceded that indexing cost - of - living increases to what economists call the " @entity264 " would create a new tax burden for middle - class @entity183 the @entity9 's budget blueprint suggests that these programs would see $ 230 billion in costs savings over 10 years			1
the @entity287 puts the number at $ 216 billion			0
the @entity287 also notes , however - and the @entity9 omits - that a switch to the chained @entity264 will also raise more than $ 124 billion in new tax revenues			1
the money will come pouring in because the consumer price index also controls income tax brackets , tax filers ' standard deductions , nontaxable contribution limits for 401 ( k ) retirement plans , and more			2
so millions of individual @entity183 will see themselves moved involuntarily to higher tax brackets , and middle - class taxpayers in particular will lose some of the tax credits and deductions that they count on			1
@entity9 press secretary @entity278 conceded as much during an april 5 briefing , when @entity306 news chief @entity9 correspondent @entity304 asked if it would ' raise taxes on middle - income @entity183			1
' ' i 'm not disputing that , ' @entity278 said , adding that ' it is not the president 's ideal policy			0
' it will , however , be part of his budget			0
this crucial excerpt from the president 's 6 - page budget outline , distributed to reporters tuesday under a strict embargo order , shows how the @entity1 administration proposes to create new cost savings over the next ten years @entity325 activists have taken issue with the chained @entity264 in recent weeks , turning up by the hundred in front of the @entity9 to protest what they predict will be @entity269 and @entity331 cuts related to the government 's new cost - of - living math. the prospect of a middle - class tax hike will mobilize conservatives			1
the resulting discord may give @entity1 enough cover to proceed with some other elements of his budget , including $ 50 billion in new stimulus spending on roads , transit systems and other public works projects			0
also expected is a tax increase on tobacco that would fund a new program of universally available preschool			0
the @entity348 reported tuesday morning that the budget will include $ 235 million in new mental health spending , aimed at helping schools prevent the next @entity352 , @entity354 - style gun massacre			0
and @entity9 leak to @entity355 tuesday night indicates at least one potential victory lap for which the administration is already preparing			2
those extra catfish inspectors ? they 'll be gone , an unnamed official told the news network .			0

@entity9 promises $ 1.8 trillion in deficit reduction , although similar previous claims have been *debunked*
new method of measuring cost - of - living increases will lower benefit payouts and push middle - class earners into higher tax brackets
speaker @entity36 's *spokesperson* : ' any deficit reduction will come exclusively from tax hikes '
administration 's formula depends on cost savings from @entity174 , which may be more costly to implement than *previously* thought
