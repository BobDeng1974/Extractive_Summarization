by @entity0 , @entity1 editor published : 15:49 est , 18 september 2013 updated : 03:51 est , 19 september 2013 passengers hit by flight delays caused by bad weather may now be able to claim compensation of up to £ 510 per person following a landmark court case			1
the decision is expected to open the door to compensation claims dating back six years that are estimated to be worth tens of millions of pounds			0
usually airlines reject compensation claims for delays caused by ‘ extraordinary circumstances ’ outside their control			2
a court has ordered @entity19 pay compensation to passenger @entity20 whose @entity21 to @entity23 flight was delayed because of bad weather earlier in the day although this allowed them to deny payments to passengers on flights hit by bad weather , it also meant no compensation for passengers on subsequent flights that suffer delays as a knock - on effect			1
however , a court in @entity36 has ruled that those on these later flights are entitled to compensation			0
the case centred on a claim brought by customers of @entity19 , however the outcome will apply to all other @entity45 airlines and can be backdated by six years			2
under the court ’s ruling , an airline will still be able to deny compensation to passengers on flights delayed by bad weather at the designated take - off time			1
but if the weather clears up , those affected later because planes are not in the right place at the right time will be able to make a claim			1
the compensation regime , which applies across the @entity59 , means travellers can make a claim if a flight has been delayed for at least three hours and the airline has no legitimate excuse			1
the figure varies depending on the length of the journey , rising from £ 210 per person on short - haul flights to a maximum of £ 510			0
@entity19 denied compensation to passenger @entity20 , 31 , who booked a flight from @entity21 to @entity23 in the summer of 2012 which landed three hours and 12 minutes later than scheduled			1
usually airlines reject compensation claims for delays caused by ' extraordinary circumstances ' outside their control , such as heavy snowfall			2
pictured is @entity81 under snow in 2010 under the ruling , an airline can still deny compensation to passengers on flights delayed by bad weather at the designated take - off time miss @entity20 , who is from @entity89 but was living in @entity90 , made a claim herself , but @entity19 turned her away citing high winds and bad weather			1
however , she knew there had been no bad weather in either @entity21 or @entity23 and so pursued the case			1
it later transpired that her plane had been held up earlier in the day by high winds on another route			0
the judge sitting at the county court in @entity101 ruled that this did not give @entity19 the right to deny compensation and awarded miss @entity20 £ 210			1
her solicitors said the decision makes clear that airlines should have enough planes and staff to cope in these circumstances			0
@entity112 , the managing partner of @entity114 solicitors , said : ‘ it ’s a victory for passenger rights			2
despite the fact that @entity19 made what should be a simple process very complicated for their customers , justice ultimately prevailed			0
‘ the law is clear and airlines continue to exhibit a flagrant disregard for the regulations			0
the very fact that passengers have to resort to using a solicitor to recover their compensation shows the lack of respect the airlines have towards their customers			0
‘ we receive hundreds of cases every week where passengers have not got anywhere with the airlines			0
’ @entity19 said it will take steps to minimise the impact of bad weather on passengers			1
a spokesman said : ‘ delays of this type are extremely rare and @entity19 does everything possible to provide information and care for all customers in line with our obligations			2
we are reviewing the cases to understand whether further measures can be put in place to minimise the impact of adverse weather on our flying schedule			0

@entity158 ordered @entity19 to pay compensation to passenger @entity20
her @entity21 to @entity23 flight delayed because of earlier bad weather
ruling has been hailed as a ' victory for passenger rights '
ruling means airline can still deny compensation if bad weather delays flight at designated take - off time
but if weather clears up , passengers could claim if there are knock - on delays
