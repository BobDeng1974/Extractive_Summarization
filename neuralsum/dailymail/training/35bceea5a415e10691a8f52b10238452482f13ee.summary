during a @entity2 shareholder meeting on monday , a conservative activist accused the aircraft company 's ceo of buying then - secretary of state @entity6 's ' commercial advocacy ' in @entity7 by making a $ 900,000 donation to the @entity9			1
the money was earmarked for rebuilding schools in @entity12 in the wake of a devastating 2010 earthquake			1
but the contribution came just months after mrs. @entity6 traveled to @entity16 where she made what she called a ' shameless pitch ' to ask a newly formed state - owned airline ' to buy @entity2 aircraft			1
' it 's not clear whether there was a quid - pro - quo promise of the donation in exchange for mrs. @entity6 's cheerleading			1
@entity27 promised during the october 13 , 2009 visit to @entity29 that the @entity30 ' would welcome an application for financing from @entity33 [ the airline ] to support its purchase of @entity36 , and i hope that on a future visit i 'll see a lot of new @entity2 planes when i land in @entity16			1
' @entity2 ultimately won a $ 3.7 billion @entity7 contract			1
then - secretary of state @entity6 has spoken at corporate events for @entity2 , often arguing in favor of @entity7 and @entity45 purchases from the jet aircraft manufacturer -- which , it turns out , gave nearly $ 1 million to the @entity9 @entity27 visited @entity2 's @entity16 design center in oct. 2009 , making her ' shameless pitch ' for a state - owned airline to buy $ 3.7 billion worth of jets from the @entity52 company a month later , @entity27 proudly announced that @entity2 would donate $ 2 million toward the construction of the @entity52 pavilion at the 2010 @entity55 in @entity56 , @entity45			1
the company had originally offered $ 1 million			0
subsequently , the @entity9 got its own @entity2 windfall			2
the @entity58 reported monday night that @entity59 with the right - leaning @entity60 challenged @entity2 chairman and ceo w. @entity61 about the apparent ' conflict of interest , ' and wondered aloud whether the company made itself vulnerable to prosecution for fraud			1
' there is at least one lobbyist in jail right this minute for giving public employees travel and meals worth far , far less than $ 900,000 , ' @entity59 said			2
' he claims he did n't intend bribery ; that what he did was " business as usual			0
" but he 's in jail now nonetheless			0
... it seems reckless and unnecessary , even if it was not illegal			0
' @entity61 responded that he was ' confident ' mrs. @entity6 ' would have advocated for @entity77 's tractors or @entity79 's turbines with equal fervor ... with or without these few donations , ' and that he was ' highly confident that we followed the letter and the spirit of the law			2
' ' commercial advocacy by people that lead our country is highly appreciated by those of us toiling in the vineyards , ' he said			0
@entity2 did not immediately respond to a request for comment on tuesday			0
a political strategist in the state of @entity97 , where @entity2 is headquartered , had harsh words for both sides of the political slap-fest			2
' @entity61 sounded defensive , ' he said , ' but @entity59 was obnoxious and it came off like one of those @entity104 stunts where they show up and ask @entity105 to go vegetarian			0
' ' what was he expecting ? probably half of the @entity108 either makes these kinds of donations , or wishes they could figure out how to make it pay off			0
' ka - ching : @entity2 cashed in with a $ 3.7 billion contract to build 737 - 800 series aircraft like this @entity117 jet for the new @entity7 state - owned airline @entity59 ( @entity120 ) , with the @entity60 , upbraided @entity2 chairman and ceo w. @entity61 ( r ) for exposing the company to conflict - of - interest accusations ' that said , ' the strategist , concluded , ' @entity2 will get a black eye out of this , and so will @entity6			1
it seems like the longer she waits to decide whether or not to run , the more baggage there will be clustered around her feet			0
' the @entity60 , which lodged the in - meeting object , defended its actions			0
' mr. @entity61 's response is inadequate and should concern shareholders , ' the group 's chairwoman @entity134 said in a statement			0
' he ducked the kernel of our question , which is why @entity2 would make a donation to the @entity9 at a time of such a conflict of interest			1
even if the company 's intentions were pure , such a move can raise legal questions			0
' she pointed out that the @entity2 donation to mrs. @entity6 's family foundation came shortly after the @entity152 decided the ' honest services fraud ' case that kept former @entity156 executive @entity155 in prison â€“ but reduced his sentence by 10 years			1
' honest services fraud was headlining the newspapers at the very time @entity2 apparently was considering a major gift to a foundation run by the husband of the sitting secretary of state , ' @entity134 said .			2

while secretary of state , mrs. @entity6 asked @entity7 's state - owned airline @entity169 to buy @entity2 planes
@entity2 won the *multibillion* - *dollar* contract , and then made a $ 900,000 donation to a @entity9 program rebuilding schools in @entity12
a conservative activist challenged @entity2 's ceo during a shareholder meeting , saying the move could open the company to prosecution
the apparent conflict - of - interest is a black eye for mrs. @entity6 as she prepares to enter the 2016 *presidential* race
