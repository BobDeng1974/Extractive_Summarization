@entity0 wore that haunted look - even more so than usual			2
every picture of the @entity3 on the @entity5 touchline as his @entity7 side were humbled by a vulnerable but voracious @entity8 was a snapshot of inner turmoil and despair			1
he was riled and restless , pacing up and down like an innocent prisoner thrown into a cell			0
the arms were locked and folded , a stance that said ' none of you are doing what i told you			0
' @entity0 wore a horrified expression during @entity7 's surprise home defeat to @entity8 the @entity3 spent much of saturday 's game stood on the touchline with his arms folded occasionally , he tried to make a frantic point or gesture as his team squandered their chances @entity0 cut an aloof figure even on the crowded bench as @entity7 missed chance after chance occasionally , his arms would lash out , his fingers jabbing out but the point lost in the cold november air			1
and when @entity36 doubled @entity8 's lead with five minutes remaining , sealing a most unlikely victory , @entity0 clawed at his forehead , his face a mask of horror			1
this was not how it was meant to be			0
@entity0 had waited a hell of a long time to beat @entity8 and this was their best chance in years			1
@entity50 's side were a wounded animal , drained of strength by a nightmare injury list and bruised by bad results that had dented their old confidence			0
but the beast still had its claws and @entity0 's agonising wait goes on			1
to be precise , it is now 1,302 days since @entity7 last beat @entity8			2
that last success was on may 1 , 2011 - eight meetings ago - when @entity63 scored the decisive goal and @entity7 beat sir @entity66 's team			1
even that was inconsequential - @entity8 still wrapped up the title a week later and @entity7 finished fourth , something they 've made a habit of doing since			1
@entity71 and @entity72 react as they prepare to restart after @entity36 's second goal @entity75 is left grounded after an unfortunate own goal gave united the lead after 56 minutes @entity36 's late second wrapped up an unlikely victory for injury - ravaged @entity8 @entity8 boss @entity50 set up his team to be tenacious and dangerous on the break , to good effect and there 's a very good reason why they keep coming fourth			1
it is 1,122 days since they last defeated @entity88 and 838 since they beat @entity89 in the league			2
going back to the season after the @entity93 , @entity7 's record against @entity89 , @entity8 and @entity88 reads : played 63 @entity94 29 for 65 against 99			1
this means they have taken 68 points from a possible 189 against the three leading title contenders during the last decade			2
they simply do n't perform in the big games			0
taking @entity89 out of the equation , they have won just eight of their last 42 matches against @entity8 and @entity88			1
it is pertinent to mention that fantastic team of 2003 - 2004 because @entity0 still seems to be dining out on it			2
the decade since has been one of perpetual disappointment and 10 years is a tremendously long time in this game			0
he simply would n't still be in his post at most other clubs			0
@entity63 fires home the winner the last time @entity7 beat @entity8 back in may 2011 @entity116 and @entity117 trudge off after @entity7 's loss at @entity119 last season @entity7 's 8 - 2 loss at @entity8 in august 2011 was the most humiliating of their poor results against them beating the likes of @entity124 and @entity125 is all well and good but @entity7 - and @entity0 - have failed in the important , season - defining contests for far too long			1
with 17 points from their opening 12 matches , this is @entity7 's worst ever start in the @entity131 and it is remarkable the @entity7 faithful are n't in open mutiny			1
with @entity136 , long mooted as @entity0 's successor , admitting for the first time this week that he will listen to offers from @entity140 , change must surely be afoot			1
while @entity0 retains plenty of loyalists , there is a groundswell of opinion , especially amongst the @entity146 , that he can take them no further than fourth and fresh ideas and fresh energy is required			2
ideas , or the lack of them , certainly came into it against @entity8			0
@entity0 and @entity153 square up on the touchline during @entity88 's 2 - 0 win earlier this season @entity88 's @entity156 celebrates scoring the second of their six goals against @entity7 last season @entity160 puts @entity89 ahead at the @entity5 earlier in the season @entity7 were humbled 6 - 3 at the @entity163 last season as they failed to compete with @entity89 as @entity0 said afterwards : ' it was a game that we dominated for 80 per cent of the time and it 's a long time since we have dominated games against @entity8 like we did today			1
' true , but why then did they lose ? @entity7 were naive in underestimating a well below - strength opposition and horrendously profligate in front of goal			2
they enjoyed 61 per cent of the ball and created 23 chances , something unheard of against @entity8 teams of old			0
yet they scored just once , in the fifth minute of injury time when the contest was over			0
it was painfully evident that @entity0 did n't know where to position @entity180 , who had a point to prove against his former club , switching him from out wide to in the middle and then back out wide and then back to the middle - all during the first - half			2
it was the kind of slapstick that @entity189 and @entity190 , the stars of @entity188 sat in the stands , would have been proud of			0
@entity192 boss @entity136 has been linked with a move to @entity7 @entity189 and @entity190 , stars of the film @entity188 , are interviewed at the @entity5 @entity180 's effectiveness was curbed by continually being switched from the middle to a wide position @entity63 and @entity199 should have been tormenting an inexperienced back - line of @entity201 and @entity202 but seemed to fade on the big occasion			1
@entity116 was more effective going forward but could easily have seen red for his sticking his head into @entity206 's chin			0
@entity0 will pray his latest injury is n't serious			0
that it took a wasteful @entity7 95 minutes to breach @entity8 's back line said it all			1
@entity0 looked anguished at the final whistle , what should have been a comfortable win ending in a defeat and he knew he had no excuses			0
that 's something that could be applied to his tenure as a whole			0
he 's benefited from a patient hierarchy and plenty of cash , especially of late , and yet @entity7 continue to tread water			2
the excuses have dried up			0
the clock is ticking .			0

@entity0 's record against leading clubs is very poor
@entity7 have won just 17 of 63 matches against @entity8 , @entity89 and @entity88 over the last decade
they were surprisingly beaten 2 - 1 by @entity8 at the @entity5 on saturday
*gunners* are enduring their worst ever start to a @entity131 season
many fans are of the opinion @entity0 's time is coming to an end
@entity192 's @entity136 is favourite to take over
