a customer who altered a credit card contract without the provider noticing is now suing the bank - for breaching his own terms and conditions			1
@entity7 @entity6 , 42 , was n't happy with the credit card terms being offered by @entity9 so he scanned the document into his computer and made a few changes			1
his more favourable terms included unlimited credit , zero per cent interest and no bank fees or fines			1
he also added a clause that he could fine the bank three million ruples - around £ 588 - every time the company failed to comply with the rules and a further six million ruples - £ 117 - if they tried to terminate the contract			2
mr @entity6 , from @entity25 , @entity7 , then sent the amended contract back to @entity27 which did n't pick up on the alterations and returned him the signed paperwork along with a credit card			1
getting a better offer : @entity6 , 42 , decided to rewrite the terms of a credit card contract and is now suing @entity9 for breaching his terms and conditions after two years of using the account , the @entity7 company terminated mr @entity6 's credit card in 2010 because he was late on his minimum payments , @entity36 reported			1
the company then took him to court to try and reclaim 45,000 rubles - around £ 881 - in unpaid fees and charges			0
but as mr @entity6 's contract with @entity27 stated he did not have to pay the bank any fines or account fees , a @entity7 court ruled this week that he only needed to repay the outstanding balance on the card - just 19,000 ( approximately £ 371 )			1
the judge ruled : ' they signed the documents without looking			0
they said what usually their borrowers say in court : " we have not read it "			0
' all in the small print : mr @entity6 changed the contract terms to give himself 0 % interest , unlimited credit and exemption from fines and bank fees			1
he is now suing @entity27 for not honouring the contract they signed after failing to read his altered small print and after his victory in court , mr @entity6 is suing the bank for 24million rubles - approximately £ 470,000 - for not honouring the amended contract they signed			1
his lawyer @entity73 told @entity74 : ' @entity75 confirmed its agreement to the client 's terms and sent him a credit card and a copy of the approved application form			2
' the opened credit line was unlimited			0
he could afford to buy an island somewhere in @entity84 , and the bank would have to pay for it by law			0
' @entity27 has launched a counter claim against mr @entity6 , accusing him of fraud			2
@entity90 , founder of the bank , tweeted : ' our lawyers think he is going to get not 24m , but really 4 years in prison for fraud			0
now it 's a matter of principle for @ tcsbanktwitter			0
' the court will review mr @entity100 's case next month			0
allegation : founder of @entity9 @entity90 , pictured , has accused mr @entity6 of fraud			2

@entity6 , 42 , made his own alterations to a credit card contract
he gave himself 0 % interest , unlimited credit and exemption from fines
mr @entity6 sent the amended contract back to @entity9 which sent him a credit card without noticing the changes
the company tried to *sue* mr @entity6 two years later for late payments
but a court ruled mr @entity6 only had to pay the balance owed but not the interest or late fees as per the terms in his contract
mr @entity6 is now suing the bank for breaching the terms of the contract
