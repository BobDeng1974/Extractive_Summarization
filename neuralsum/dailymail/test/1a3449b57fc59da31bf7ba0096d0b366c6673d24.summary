the only one that does n't is the @entity32 model ( pictured above ) the glass is made from synthetic sapphire , which is created by applying heat and pressure to aluminium oxide powder , before being processed to remove impurities			1
here , it withstands being scratched by sandpaper synthetic sapphire is a hard , transparent material made of crystallising aluminium oxide , produced at high temperatures and pressures			1
as the material is heated , it forms disks that can be sliced using diamond - coated saws			2
these round disks are ground into shape , and polished , to become glass			2
the resulting glass is thin , super-strong and scratch resistant			0
@entity1 already uses sapphire crystal in the @entity54 fingerprint scanner on the @entity55 and 6 , as well as to protect the phones ’ camera			0
the @entity58 and @entity59 both have sapphire glass screens , while the @entity32 version has a strengthened @entity63 glass screen , which is thought to be more shatterproof			1
if the price of manufacturing the glass drops , it could potentially replace @entity67 currently used in most high - end smartphones			0

the tiny round disks created are ground into shape , and polished , to become glass			0
@entity79 glass is said to be twice as tough as normal glass and almost as hard as a diamond			0
the regular version , which costs from $ 549 ( £ 479 ) and the edition watch , from $ 12,000 ( £ 8,000 ) both have sapphire glass screens , while the cheaper ' @entity32 ' version , costing from $ 349 ( £ 299 ) has a strengthened @entity63 glass screen , which @entity88 describes as ‘ more shatterproof and impact resistant than sapphire glass '			1
to test the durability of the screen , it was rubbed against a stone wall and then with a coin , before being ‘ scratched ’ by a key			0
the video capturing the attempts at destruction , shows no scratches were achieved to the screen			0
it also withstood being rubbed with abrasive sandpaper at some force and hit by a hammer – albeit not very hard			1
the video showing the attempts at destruction , shows no scratches were achieved to the screen , even when a power drill was switched on and dragged across it ( pictured ) but most impressive , was the screen ’s ability to withstand an electric drill being dragged across its surface , without leaving a mark			0
the test led @entity88 to claim : ‘ sapphire glass is pretty strong and virtually impossible to scratch ’			1
rumours abounded that the @entity120 would get a sapphire screen , but it did n’t , possibly because the material is expensive to make when compared with standard of tough @entity67			1
