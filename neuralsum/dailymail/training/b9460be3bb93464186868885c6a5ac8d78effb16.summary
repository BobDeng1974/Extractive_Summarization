@entity0 joined @entity1 on loan a few weeks ago looking for redemption and revival			1
so far all he has found is glory , scoring both his side ’s goals here to help them move back to the giddy heights of third place — just a week after his debut ended with a first @entity1 win at @entity14 for 27 years			1
this victory was @entity1 ’s third away from home in a week , following that success at @entity19 then a midweek @entity20 win at @entity21 , as they continue to defy expectations			1
it also meant a fourth straight match from four without a win in the temporary reign of @entity19 ’s caretaker manager @entity27			2
@entity0 scored twice as @entity1 won 2 - 1 away at @entity19 in their @entity29 encounter on saturday evening @entity0 ( left ) scored the matchwinning goal in the second half - as his strike took a deflection of @entity19 defender @entity34 ( centre ) @entity0 ( left ) leaps up in the air in sheer delight as he restores @entity1 's lead on 62 minutes at @entity39 @entity0 ( second left ) is mobbed by his @entity1 team - mates after netting his second goal of the match against the @entity43 @entity19 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity44 5.5 ; @entity34 4.5 , @entity45 5 , @entity46 6 ( @entity47 80 ) , @entity48 6 ; @entity49 6 ( @entity50 68 , 6 ) , @entity51 6.5 ; @entity52 6 , @entity53 6.5 , @entity54 6 ( @entity55 68 , 5.5 ) ; @entity56 6 subs not used : @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity47 , @entity60 , @entity61			1

home fans were dismayed not just by the result but that a late shout for a penalty was denied by referee @entity85 after a shot from @entity50 was stopped by @entity100 ’s @entity99 hand			0
‘ when you arms are by your side , maybe it ’s not a penalty , ’ said @entity27			0
‘ when your arm is l - shaped and it hits your hand , it ’s a penalty			0
they [ @entity1 ] got the breaks at the right time			2
’ @entity0 is a 27 - year - old @entity111 winger who played , aged 23 , for the @entity112 in the 2010 world cup final but who did not continue to blossom			1
he is now on loan from @entity116 and looking to make a fresh start after periods of fitful form and off - field controversy			0
a speeding offence in 2013 in @entity122 was the most serious of his ‘ bad boy ’ transgressions but he was also criticised for inflammatory tweets last year when he posted ‘ ready for war ’ in the build - up to a @entity116 versus @entity128 match			0
he evidently feels a huge debt of gratitude to @entity1 manager @entity83 — to whom he dashed after scoring his first goal , tightly hugging his new boss before giving him an energetic thump on the arm			1
@entity83 said : ‘ he needs to know his coach has confidence in him			0
and he needs to play in his best position like today			0
he was fast , strong , sharp			0
’ asked if he could ‘ tame ’ @entity0 and help him finally flourish , @entity83 said : ‘ yes , i hope			2
if he keeps his concentration on football			2
he ’s doing well , he ’s showing a lot of discipline			0
’ @entity83 said he was especially pleased with today ’s win given three away games in a row — and key absentees			0
‘ it was a long , difficult week , ’ he said			0
‘ three games away but if you win you gain confidence , spirit			0
‘ it was great to beat @entity19 but , as a manager , the win today is better because it ’s the third [ away ] game and we were without key players			2
’ @entity0 ( left ) gave @entity1 the lead on 14 minutes - his first goal in @entity162 football since joining the @entity1 on loan this month @entity0 ( far right ) slips down the inside left of @entity19 's channel before firing a low shot past his @entity111 compatriot @entity44 ( centre ) the @entity112 international ( below ) watches from the floor as his shot heads towards goal @entity44 ( left ) is left a mere spectator as @entity0 's fizzing shot goes underneath him in the @entity19 goal @entity0 ( left ) ran straight to @entity1 boss @entity83 to share in the moment of his first goal for the club @entity0 's new team - mates are quick to join in the celebrations of their team - mates goal at @entity39 @entity83 was forced into three changes from the starters who began at @entity19 having lost an influential trio to injury in @entity187 ( abductor ) , @entity189 and @entity190 ( both hamstring )			1
they were respectively replaced by home - grown midfielder @entity70 , 19 , midfielder @entity193 returning to the starting line - up and summer signing @entity68 of @entity195			0
while the deputies ultimately helped to land another fine result , this was a fourth match in charge without a win for @entity27 , a @entity19 - born lifelong fan of the club , who turned 50 on friday amid continuing uncertainly about who will be permanent manager			2
he believes the club needs an end to the uncertainty around the post			0
‘ absolutely , ’ he said			0
‘ i hope it ends in the next two weeks			0
’ @entity19 soon brought themselves level on 29 minutes through @entity54 ( far right ) @entity54 's ( right ) goal came fortuitously as @entity68 ' ( centre left ) clearance hits the winger before going into into the net @entity54 ( right ) watches on as his crucial deflection flies towards the @entity1 goal to level the scores @entity1 have progressed from uncertainty over whether a transformed post-summer team would be competitive this season to the only question being how long they can sustain a remarkable run in the top four			1
@entity227 to that is whether or not they have the strength in depth to keep it going			0
certainly this result was a positive sign			0
@entity19 had most of the possession and three chances inside the first 12 minutes			1
but @entity1 took the lead when a long ball was cushioned down on the chest of @entity76 to @entity237 , who played in @entity0 and he finished low across @entity44			1
the @entity19 goalkeeper could have done better but it was a quick fluid move and the hosts were caught off guard			2
@entity19 were back level just before the half hour via a fluke			1
@entity68 ran in to make a clearance from a through ball , when @entity65 might have taken it , but succeeded only in smacking the ball into the oncoming @entity54 , off whom it rebounded into the @entity1 net			1
it was @entity54 ’s first goal since december 2013			2
@entity19 were in the ascendancy in the second half until @entity83 made a double substitution on the hour , taking off @entity256 and @entity193 and replacing them with @entity257 and @entity71			1
two minutes after that , @entity1 were back in front			2
@entity71 headed a ball from midfield which @entity0 chased down , before running between @entity45 and @entity34 — who then unwittingly deflected in @entity0 ’s shot			1
the 28 - year - old ( left ) celebrates his strike in a customary fashion to @entity19 legend @entity267 the former @entity269 man ( left ) then points to his wrist in celebration of his equaliser on saturday evening @entity0 ( left ) was given a standing ovation by the travelling @entity1 supporters when he was substituted in the second half			1

@entity0 gave @entity1 the lead on 14 minutes with his first goal in @entity162 football
@entity19 equalised midway through the first half through a fortuitous @entity54 goal
@entity0 restored the *visitors* lead just after the hour mark with a deflected strike off @entity34 's leg
@entity1 striker @entity76 nearly extended the lead but saw his header hit the crossbar on *77* minutes
@entity1 now have *42* points after 22 games , while @entity19 are 11th with 27 points
