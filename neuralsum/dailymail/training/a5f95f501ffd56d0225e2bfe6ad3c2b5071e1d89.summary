the world 's only known albino gorilla looked the way he did because of inbreeding , a new study has claimed			1
a vial of frozen blood taken from @entity9 the gorilla - who lived at @entity12 for 40 years until his death in 2003 - discovered he inherited the gene from his parents			1
after tracing this gene , @entity17 scientists discovered his parents were closely related - sharing 12 per cent of their dna - which suggests they were uncle and niece			1
@entity9 was born with albinism - a genetic mutation that causes a loss of colour pigments in skin and hair			1
he lived for 40 years before dying of skin cancer in 2003			2
@entity17 scientists have discovered that his albino gene was inherited from this parents , who shared 12 per cent of dna suggesting they were uncle and niece @entity9 's celebrity status was enhanced when he featured on the @entity35 album @entity36 in 2001 @entity9 was famous for being the only known albino gorilla in the world			1
a western lowland gorilla , he lived at the zoo until his death from skin cancer in 2003			1
he was born in the wild with albinism - a genetic mutation that caused him to lack colour pigments in his skin and hair - but was captured by villagers in @entity49 in 1966			1
his iconic colouring also put him on the cover of @entity35 's 2001 album , @entity36			0
before he died , a vial of blood was taken and frozen to preserve it and the genome was sequenced in 2012			1
as reported in the journal @entity58 , the researchers , led by @entity60 at the university of @entity62 , in @entity17 , were then able to take this sequencing and compare it to non-albino gorilla genomes to find the cause of his genetic mutation			2
the scientists isolated @entity9 's albinism to a single gene called @entity71			2
@entity9 inherited this mutation directly from his parents and when the researchers delved further into the dna of his mother and father they discovered stretches of @entity9 's dna from both parents were identical			1
they were able to determine that his mother and father shared 12 per cent of their dna and concluded that this likely made them uncle and niece			0
albinism is a birth defect that causes humans and animals to be born without colour pigments in their skin , hair and eyes			1
@entity9 was born in the wild but was captured by villagers in @entity49 in 1966			0
he then spent the rest of his life in @entity12 , until his death in 2003 albinism comes from the @entity105 word albus which means for ' white '			2
it is also known as achromia			0
albinism is a is a birth defect that causes humans and animals to be born without colour pigments in their skin , hair and eyes			1
it is caused by a lack of tyrosinase in their genes - an enzyme involved in the production of melanin			0
melanin is what causes skin colour and an increase in melanin is what causes skin to tan			0
a human or animal with complete absence of melanin is called an albino , while someone with only a small amount of melanin is called an albinoid			0
lack of skin pigmentation makes people and animals more susceptible to sunburn and skin cancers			0
snowflake the albino gorilla died of skin cancer in 2003			1
it is caused by a lack of tyrosinase - an enzyme involved in the production of melanin , which is what causes skin colour and an increase in melanin is what causes skin to tan			2
a human or animal with complete absence of melanin is called an albino , while someone with only a small amount of melanin is called an albinoid			0
lack of skin pigmentation makes people and animals more susceptible to sunburn and skin cancers , which is what killed @entity9 a decade ago			0
the findings are the first evidence of interbreeding in western lowland gorillas			0
however @entity170 told @entity171 that some gorilla subspecies with small populations will mate with each other to preserve the species , or due to a lack of options			0
the study concludes : ' we envision that the analysis of whole genome data of endangered species will be a standard in future conservation and management studies and will make available relevant information that has been missed in previous studies			0
' @entity17 scientists were able to isolate the cause of @entity9 's albinism using genome sequencing			1
as shown in the left - hand chart , the @entity71 was the prominent gene that @entity9 had which the non-albino gorillas @entity194 and @entity196 did n't			2
the right - hand chart shows where these genes overlapped in each gorilla			0

snowflake the albino gorilla inherited the gene that caused him to be born without colour pigments in his skin and hair
@entity17 scientists sequenced this genome and discovered that his parents were closely related to each other - likely uncle and niece
the researchers analysed *samples* from a vial of frozen blood taken from @entity9 before he died in 2003
his albinism is thought to have led to his death from skin cancer
