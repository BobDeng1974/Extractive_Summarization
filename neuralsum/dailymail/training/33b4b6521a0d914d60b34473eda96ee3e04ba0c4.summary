by @entity0 @entity2 's biggest colony of leafcutter ants has self - destructed after chewing through a power cable in its tank			1
more than a million of the tropical insects - who can carry 20 times their weight in their jaws - had been living at @entity10 near @entity11 , @entity12			1
they were dominated by a giant queen ant , the size of a small mouse , who was protected by an inner circle of soldier ants			1
disaster : @entity2 's biggest colony of leafcutter ants has self - destructed after chewing through a power cable in its tank			1
above , a worker ant at @entity10 near @entity11 , @entity24 , where the incident happened but in recent weeks , some of the ants had started nibbling on a power lead in their glass cabinet , which was linked to a water tank regulating their temperature			1
they finally bit through the lead and sent an electric current shooting through the colony - killing the queen and her soldier guards			1
most of the worker ants escaped the shock as they were in a separate part of the enclosure cutting leaves			0
but carnage erupted when they returned to find the queen and her inner circle dead			0
without a queen to protect , fighting broke out and the leaderless ants started dying in huge numbers as they killed each other or starved to death			1
wildlife park : more than a million of the tropical insects had been living at @entity10 ( pictured ) at the time at work : most of the worker ants escaped the shock as they were in a separate part of the tank			1
but carnage erupted when they returned to find the queen and her ' soldiers ' dead			0
above , a leafcutter ant at the wildlife park and within two months , every single member of the colony at the wildlife park was dead			2
@entity10 spokeswoman @entity68 said there was nothing staff could have done to help the ants after their queen was killed			1
' it was a freak accident			0
the ants are quite adventurous and i guess some of them took a fancy to the wire , ' she said			0
' the electric shock killed the queen , who was the size of a small mouse			2
once that happened , everything changed			0
' the ants started wandering around aimlessly because they had no queen to protect			2
they sort of lost their purpose in life			0
it was horrible to watch them all dying			0
cutting leaves : without a queen to protect , fighting broke out and the leaderless ants started dying as they killed each other or starved to death			2
within two months , every single member of the colony was dead ' afterwards we dug into the tank to see if we could find her body but she was nâ€™t there			0
we think the ants probably ate her after she died			0
' we are all really sad about it because they were characters and although they could be a real nuisance they were part of @entity10			0
' ms @entity68 added that the power lead had been inside the tank for four years and was a commonly - used method of controlling its temperature			2
the park has now hired an ant specialist to find a replacement queen in the rainforest in @entity123 in a bid to start building a new leafcutter ant colony .			1
