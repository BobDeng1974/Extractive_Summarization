by @entity0 on the first day of my summer holiday i was standing outside a bar , drinking with friends			1
everyone was laughing and joking , looking forward to a brilliant week in @entity6			1
and i knew what was going to happen			1
a fluttering in my stomach triggered a quickening heartbeat			1
i started overheating and sweating			1
then a wave of anxiety swept through me , and i felt like i was drowning in white noise			1
as the attack reached its climax , i was overwhelmed by an urge to lie down			1
@entity0 had fainting episodes and was undiagnosed for 30 years only to find out he had a faulty heartbeat as ever , it was terrifying			1
but there was nothing i could do			1
the next thing i knew , i was waking up on the floor , surrounded by people panicking that i 'd been unconscious for nearly 30 seconds			1
i sat up and reassured them there was nothing to worry about - this happened all the time			1
but i was rushed by ambulance to hospital , where they ran all kinds of tests to check i had n't damaged my head as it hit the ground			1
i was fine - though too exhausted to care			1
i remained worn out for a few days and was left with such acute anxiety about another attack that my holiday was ruined			1
since the age of seven , i 'd fainted on countless occasions			1
and over three decades , coping with the condition - whatever it was - had become part of my life			1
there were periods when i 'd faint a few times a year , but others when it would happen a few times a day			1
and although there were some triggers i 'd learned to look out for - being tired , dehydrated , stressed , claustrophobic or too hot - an attack could occur at random			1
by the time i was working as the culture editor of @entity55 , i was so terrified of it happening when i was on camera that i took beta - blockers to manage my anxiety			1
they helped and i was fortunate not to have an attack on air			1
but i had no idea what was wrong			1
his condition is highly dangerous and he has now had fitted pacemaker then after that holiday in @entity6 , i was so fed - up with how my undiagnosed condition was affecting my life , i went to my gp and told him i needed an answer			1
not that i had n't already been offered several			2
a succession of specialists - @entity74 and private - had told me my attacks were down to adolescence , iron deficiency , slow heart rate , low blood pressure or even epilepsy			2
others said my problem was purely psychological - an extreme form of panic attacks , which made me feel it was something i should be ashamed of			2
i spent thousands on hypnotherapy , cognitive behavioural therapy and psychotherapy - but none made any difference			2
by my mid- 30s , i 'd become dependent on beta - blockers and was taking the maximum dosage of anti-epilepsy drugs			2
i was so out of it i had no idea how often my attacks happened			2
my memory was decimated , my sex drive disappeared and my sparkle diminished			2
but one thing i was sure of - the problem was getting worse			2
and 30 years of living in fear of it had reduced me to a nervous wreck			2
every area of my life had been contaminated : going to the hairdresser , eating out , trips to the cinema and theatre - not to mention first dates and job interviews			2
you name the situation , i 've fainted in it			2
and the more i worked myself up in expectation of an attack , the more likely it was to happen			2
when the epilepsy diagnosis was overturned , since the drugs did n't work , i saw no alternative but to believe all those specialists who 'd told me it was self - induced			2
when i went back to the @entity71 after that holiday in 2012 , i was at breaking point			2
at the first stirrings of an attack , i 'd started wishing i would n't wake up afterwards			2
after so long without a satisfactory answer , i expected to be fobbed off			2
but i was referred to the @entity129 in @entity130 for a ' tilt table test '			0
i lay on my back and was strapped to a table that was tilted forwards , suspending me head - first at 60 degrees			0
electrodes were placed all over me and i was injected with a drug that made me lose consciousness for 20 seconds			0
for someone who 'd spent his life in fear of such attacks it was the closest thing i could imagine to torture			0
once it was over , as usual i was exhausted			0
the worst thing was , as i had n't known what to expect and had travelled to the hospital alone , i had to be accompanied home by a nurse			0
i had reached my nadir			0
but the test finally gave me the answer			1
and my problem was definitely physical , not psychological			0
i have autonomically mediated syncope with asystole			1
most doctors have n't even heard of it			0
it 's difficult to say how many adults are affected , as symptoms can be similar to epilepsy , which explains why misdiagnosis is so common			0
but recent research by the @entity166 on @entity167 shows that up to 30 per cent of adults diagnosed with epilepsy actually suffer from some form of syncope - where they faint or black out			1
this represents around 125,000 people in the @entity175			0
autonomically mediated syncope is a problem with the ' automatic ' nervous system , which allows different organs to communicate with each other			1
the pathways from my brain to my heart are defective , instructing my heart to shut down			0
this is commonly known as ' flat - lining ' , the near - death experience made into the film @entity188 , starring @entity189			0
in my case , my heart rate races , drops sharply , cuts out completely for about 20 seconds , then restarts			0
i lose consciousness because it interrupts the circulation of oxygenated blood to the @entity195 , the brain has a mechanism to restart the heart , so there 's no chance of it cutting out permanently - and even the most frequent attacks leave no permanent damage			0
the real risk is that you badly injure yourself as you fall			0
@entity206 has autonomically mediated syncope with asystole			1
most doctors have n't even heard of it i was referred to dr @entity211 , a consultant cardiologist			0
she told me she 'd met countless people like me , often after years of misdiagnosis			0
there was even a support group - stars ( @entity216 )			0
i was tearful with relief			0
soon afterwards , i was admitted to hospital to have a pacemaker fitted			0
since then , whenever my heart rate has dropped , my pacemaker has kicked in to stop my heart from cutting out			0
so far , it has n't let me down and i have n't fainted for nearly a year			0
i 've been able to come off all medication , which has restored my energy and my memory			0
i finally feel like i 've started living.but my story does n't end there			1
a month after the operation , i returned to dr @entity211 for a check - up			0
i was told there was bad news - my pacemaker had kicked in 817 times in the first month , that 's 817 times when previously i would have fainted			0
mine was the worst case of autonomically mediated syncope she had ever seen			1
i did n't see the news as bad			0
for me it justified how worked up i 'd been			0
i was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and referred to a psychologist , who explained that after decades of living in my own metaphorical war zone , my body was in a constant state of high alert			1
i had to readjust to living without fear			0
i 've now made that adjustment - and decided to give up my stressful job at @entity55 to devote myself to my ultimate ambition , writing novels			1
the first , published this month , is a romantic comedy about a @entity253 actress who falls in love with a paparazzi photographer			0
most people can spot the double meaning , but only those who know what i 've been through can spot the third			0
@entity0 's novel @entity257 is published on april 24 by @entity262 at Â£ 7.99 .			0
