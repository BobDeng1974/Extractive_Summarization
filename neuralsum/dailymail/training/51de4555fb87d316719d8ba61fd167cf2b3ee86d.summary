what started out as a passionate hobby for @entity8 a year ago has been so successful that he has plans to eventually throw in his tech job to concentrate on taking the stunning images using a drone and a @entity14 on a full time basis			1
' as a day job , i would like to go more into the production side of using the drone and do it more commercially which would be nice , ' he said			0
' this is just something that i found and thought it would be good to see things differently			0
check equipment and batteries before sending up the drone 2			0

' then i 'll wait five seconds before bringing it back to look at them and see if i 've got the right shot and if not - i 'll go back up again			0
' the first person view screen that @entity8 uses when he sends up the drone helps with his accuracy of the photos he is looking to capture			1
' more often than not i 'll get the shot the first time rather than just wait there and my wife has helped me out with lighting and that type of thing , ' he said			2
