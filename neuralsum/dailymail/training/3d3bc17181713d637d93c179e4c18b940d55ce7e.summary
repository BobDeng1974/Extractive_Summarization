by @entity0 @entity1 : 17:47 est , 23 december 2013 @entity2 : 22:03 est , 23 december 2013 there are lots of things @entity6 does n’t want for @entity7 this year			1
no doctors , no nurses , no tubes to be hooked up to , and definitely no hospitals			0
and as her mother , watching her lively three - year - old exploring under the christmas tree , is delighted to say , @entity6 ’s wish is coming true			0
in fact , this is the first @entity7 her little girl will really be able to enjoy the magic of the season , free of the health problems that nearly cost her life			2
@entity24 : three - year - old @entity25 and her mother @entity26 will be celebrating @entity7 at home this year after @entity6 spent the last one in hospital because of a life - threatening heart condition @entity6 has been fighting for her life ever since she was diagnosed with a rare heart condition when she was just six months old			1
placed at the top of the transplant list and kept alive by an artificial heart , doctors told her parents , @entity36 , 28 , and @entity37 , 34 , to expect the worst			1
at their lowest ebb , the couple even started to make funeral arrangements			0
even when @entity6 started to recover without having a transplant after her heart healed itself she then caught a nasty chest infection and she was once again forced to rely on an artificial heart			1
luckily four months later @entity6 underwent a successful heart transplant and began making a full recovery			1
now her mother has described her relief at having her daughter home in time for her fourth @entity7 with an all clear			1
@entity6 was diagnosed with a rare condition aged just six months meaning her heart was enlarged close to death : doctors did n't think she would make it to her first birthday and her parents even started making funeral arrangements as her health failed her the family from @entity60 , say they can not wait to spend the day with her now there is no longer a need for @entity6 to be in kept isolation as she was last year			1
miss @entity25 said : ‘ we ’re so excited for @entity7 this year			1
we are going to spend the day with all of our family , which we could n’t do last year because @entity6 was so ill she was n’t allowed to come into contact with other people			0
‘ when she was ill we went from being a normal family to being in pieces			0
‘ then we thought she had recovered and she ended up in hospital again , we just could n’t believe she had gone back to square one - well worse even			2
alone : last year @entity6 was so ill she had to be kept in hospital isolation as human contact could have killed her desperate : during her last illness @entity6 had to have operation virtually every day due to internal bleeding artificial heart : machine kept @entity6 alive as surgeons worried she might not live long enough for a transplant ‘ we did n’t expect her to make it through - she was so ill. but now she has recovered we are just so relieved			1
’ @entity6 was born weighing a healthy 8lb 8oz in december 2010			0
but at six months she developed a persistent cough which was diagnosed as a chest infection			2
when her breathing got worse , a consultant changed suggested she was suffering from asthma , but it was only by chance that @entity6 was x-rayed by a trainee doctor who found that her heart was seriously enlarged			2
@entity6 was close to death , with her heart functioning at just four per cent , and she was hooked up to an artificial organ to keep her alive			2
as the family waited nervously for a transplant heart to become available , astonishingly @entity6 ’s heart appeared to heal itself - a process only seen in 20 cases worldwide			1
fighter : however @entity6 pulled through and will be spending @entity7 at home with family this year thankful : @entity26 says that without the kindness of a stranger donating their heart @entity6 would n't be here but the happiness was short - lived when the youngster fell ill again just months later			1
@entity6 spent four months waiting for a transplant and underwent an operation almost daily while waiting , due to internal bleeding			2
her parents were told three times their daughter was not going to make it so they began to make funeral plans			0
but the tot pulled through yet again , and now , despite the trauma , @entity6 appears to be just like any other three year old			0
miss @entity25 said : ‘ @entity6 has been through so much , she has had about 20 operations and about half have been quite major			0
‘ before @entity6 got the heart transplant the surgeons told us she was in real trouble			1
the night before her transplant was horrendous			0
i was planning her funeral in my head some nights			0
‘ it ’s a massive relief to know our baby girl is home once and for all and is back to being her cheeky little self			0
‘ despite the fact she missed out on quite a lot whilst she was in hospital she is just like every other three year old			0
