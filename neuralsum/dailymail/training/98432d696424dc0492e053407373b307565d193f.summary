by @entity0 published : 06:20 est , 11 march 2013 updated : 07:08 est , 11 march 2013 this raccoon was definitely not in the mood for its close - up when it was caught on camera while trapped inside a tree			1
the animal was trying to shelter from the heavy snow when it climbed through a hole but clearly forgot its vital statistics and became wedged			0
but the cheeky raccoon was not going to give up without a fight and stuck its tongue out at the photographer while it waited to be rescued			2
not happy : the raccoon stuck his tongue out as he was pictured trapped in the tree at @entity18 get me out of here ! the raccoon became stuck trying to shelter from the snow during the cold snap it had been in search of a hollow tree to hide from the snow at @entity18 in @entity27 when it became lodged			1
unluckily for the raccoon , @entity27 photographer @entity28 was on hand to capture its embarrassment for posterity			1
ms @entity28 , 45 , snapped the hilarious moment during a visit to the zoo and just happened upon the raccoon 's struggle			1
she said : ' it was a bitterly cold day and you could see the raccoon using all its strength to try and squeeze into the space			0
' it took a really long time to get inside but as soon as it did its face quickly turned to a look of frustration because it realised it was too big to wriggle out			0
' it did n't stop it from poking its tongue out at me though when it saw me trying to take its picture			0
' ms @entity28 , from @entity55 , regularly visits local zoos in the hope of getting the perfect image			2
she said : ' my passion is animal photography which first began with getting shots of cats and this led on to me always being on the lookout for getting pictures of all different types of animals in zoos			0
