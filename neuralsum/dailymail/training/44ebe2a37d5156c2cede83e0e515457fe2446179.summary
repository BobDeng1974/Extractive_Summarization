by @entity0 in @entity1 house speaker @entity2 and former secretary of state @entity3 today threw their weight behind president @entity7 's campaign to win support for military strikes against @entity10 ahead of a vote in @entity12 next week			1
‘ i 'm going to support the president 's call for action , and i believe my colleagues should support the president 's call for action , ’ said @entity2 , an @entity14 @entity13			1
‘ the use of these weapons has to be responded to , and only the @entity24 has the capability and the capacity to stop @entity27 and to warn others around the world that this type of behavior is not to be tolerated			2
’ mrs. @entity3 issued a statement late in the day , after a hearing concluded in the @entity34 , which heard testimony from @entity36 , her successor at @entity37			0
' @entity3 supports the president ’s effort to enlist the @entity12 in pursuing a strong and targeted response to the @entity27 regime ’s horrific use of chemical weapons , ' a @entity3 aide told @entity45			1
@entity46 , the number 2 @entity13 , echoed @entity2 hours earlier			0
he said : ' understanding that there are differing opinions on both sides of the aisle , it is up to president @entity7 to make the case to @entity12 and to the @entity24 people that this is the right course of action , and i hope he is successful in that endeavor			1
that vote will come a full two weeks after the administration conceded that a ‘ red line ’ @entity7 identified more than a year ago – involving @entity10 ’s use of chemical weapons – had been crossed			1
with support from the @entity95 evaporating and @entity106 saying it will wait to act until the @entity24 determines @entity10 's fate , the @entity7 administration is no longer calling for @entity27 's ousting - in public at least			1
‘ i think @entity27 must go – and i believe he will go , ’ @entity7 said on march 20 during a joint press conference in @entity110 with @entity112 prime minister @entity111			2
but in recent days his administration has been far less enthusiastic about throwing @entity27 out of @entity114			0
speaking in the @entity115 on saturday , @entity7 said only that he was ‘ confident we can hold the @entity27 regime accountable for their use of chemical weapons , deter this kind of behavior , and degrade their capacity to carry it out			1
’ the strength of those military strikes , and the length of any resulting armed conflict , is on clearly @entity7 ’s mind as he battles to convince a skeptical @entity128 and public who have little appetite for another drawn out conflict			1
‘ the key point that i want to emphasize to the @entity24 people , ’ the president said tuesday , is that ‘ the military plan that has been developed by the joint chiefs and that i believe is appropriate is proportional			0
it does not involve boots on the ground			0
this is not @entity141 and this is not @entity142			0
’ ready to go : an @entity143 prepares to launch from the flight deck of the aircraft carrier @entity146 in the @entity147 today			0
the @entity148 was due to leave the region but has been ordered to stay limited ? the president has said that any military action in @entity10 will be ' limited ' and not ' involve boots on the ground ' gen. @entity154 , a former army vice chief of staff , indicated tuesday that @entity7 ’s ambitions may be broader			1
speaking after talks with senators including @entity75 @entity158 of @entity159 , who emerged monday in support of @entity7 ’s plan after a personal @entity64 briefing , @entity154 told @entity163 ’s today program that ‘ the president has decided to deter the use of chemical weapons but also to degrade military capacity of the @entity27 regime			1
‘ at the same time he has upgraded the capacity of the opposing forces , ’ he added			0
‘ and it ’s the opposing forces that hopefully would be able eventually to topple the @entity27 regime			2
’ @entity174 , the @entity64 minority leader , was at the meeting today at the @entity64 and used her five - year - old grandson as a case for pushing towards war after the meeting			1
she said she told him : ' he said , ' i think no war			0
' i said , ' well , i generally agree with that but you know , they have killed hundreds of children , they 've killed hundreds of children there			0
' and he said , five years old , ' were these children in the @entity24 ? ' and i said , ' no , but they 're children wherever they are			0
' she added : ' @entity191 drew a line decades ago that i think if we ignore , we do so to the peril of many other people who can suffer			0
‘ we ’re going to be asking for hearings and a prompt vote , ’ the president said tuesday			0
‘ and i ’m very appreciative that everybody here has already begun to schedule hearings and intends to take a vote as soon as all of @entity12 comes back early next week			2
’ three different national polls conducted in the past week indicate that @entity24 may not have the stomach for another round of military intervention in the @entity208 , even if it 's limited and does n't involve ground forces.and the level of support for president @entity7 's plan has decreased with each successive poll , first by six percentage points , and then by another @entity215 a @entity216 survey , just 29 per cent of adults asked between august 29 and september 1 said they would favor military air strikes against @entity10 ' in response to reports that the @entity10 government used chemical weapons			1
' a near - majority of 48 per cent said they would oppose such @entity224 48 per cent number was the lowest among the three polls			0
a @entity229 / @entity228 poll conducted during the same period found that 59 per cent of @entity24 oppose ' the @entity24 launching missile strikes against the @entity10 government			2
' just 36 per cent said they were in favor of the @entity233 when @entity234 polled the question of whether the @entity24 should ' take military action ' against @entity10 , 50 per cent said it should not			1
that poll registered 42 per cent support for military strikes , but it 's the earliest of the three public opinion surveys			2
innocents : according to @entity24 estimates , of the 1,429 killed in the attack , 426 were children calculations : @entity7 has enlisted the support of @entity159 @entity75 @entity158 , left , as part of the campaing to corral support led in recent days by secretary of state @entity36 , right secretary of state @entity36 , secretary of defense @entity250 and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff gen. @entity252 are scheduled to make the president ’s case tuesday afternoon before the @entity34			1
a top - secret and more candid briefing will follow wednesday morning , before a noon hearing in the @entity64 featuring @entity36 and @entity258			2
meanwhile , @entity106 president @entity259 today said he would to wait for the @entity12 decision on military action in @entity10 before deciding on any action @entity106 might take			1
no doubt playing on the fears of lawmakers , @entity10 strongman @entity27 warned that the @entity208 is a ' powderkeg and fire is approaching today ' in an interview with @entity106 newspaper @entity269 published overnight			1
proof : @entity10 president @entity27 yesterday challenged the @entity24 and @entity106 to prove he used chemical weapons			1
( pictured with his @entity95 - born wife @entity272 ) into the darkness : many members of @entity12 fear that strikes on @entity12 may suck the @entity24 into an open - ended conflict like @entity141 , @entity142 or @entity277 ' you ca n’t only talk about what the @entity10 response will be , but what could happen after a first strike			1
and no one knows what would happen ' , he said			0
' everyone will lose control of the situation when the powder keg explodes			0
chaos and extremism will be widespread			0
the risk of a regional war exists			0
' the dictator also challenged the @entity24 and @entity106 to produce proof that chemical weapons were used to kill 1,429 - including 426 children - on the outskirts of @entity114			0
political handicappers agree that with the support of @entity158 and @entity303 of @entity304 , two powerful republicans , the @entity300 will easily pass a resolution authorizing @entity7 to strike against @entity27			2
@entity2 ’s support may push a resolution across the finish line in the @entity64 , although passage is by no means certain			2
the president ’s backers will have to overcome opposition from liberal doves and libertarian - leaning isolationists – many of whom are eager for payback over the president ’s @entity320 health insurance overhaul – in order to prevail .			2

vote will come a full two weeks after @entity7 's *initial* call for action when 1,426 @entity10 were killed in gas attack
house speaker @entity2 today gave his backing to military action after a meeting at the @entity64
@entity3 told a @entity1 newspaper she ' supports the president ’s effort to enlist the @entity12 ' for *approving* military action
@entity174 used an encounter with her five - year - old grandson to *bolster* the case for war
president 's *message* has been that any strikes will be ' limited and *narrow* '
but former army general says - after speaking to senators - the *ultimate* aim is to topple @entity10 dictator @entity27
