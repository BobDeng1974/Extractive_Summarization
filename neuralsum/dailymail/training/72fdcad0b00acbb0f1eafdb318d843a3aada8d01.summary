cheering , smiling and , ultimately , grimacing , @entity0 was the @entity1 's loudest supporter today as her filly estimate attempted to retain the @entity4 title she won last year			1
but unfortunately for the @entity0 , her efforts were in vain with the horse narrowly missing out to @entity10 contender @entity8 in the most prestigious race on @entity12			0
consolation for the @entity1 came in the form of a family day out , with princess @entity16 , @entity17 and the princess royal joining the monarch and the @entity0 in the @entity20			1
right : princess @entity17 waves to the crowds looking lovely : the princess royal was chic in a bright pink hat and navy blue jacket , while princess @entity16 opted for a bright orange hat by @entity50 while the @entity1 might not have managed a win on the racecourse , she took home the prizes in the style stakes with her brightest ensemble of the week so far - a turquoise @entity58 coat and matching @entity61 hat			1
the @entity0 , by contrast , went for dark glamour in a black calf - length dress and a matching hat , using pearl earrings to take the sombre edge off the look			0
meanwhile , princess @entity16 joined the @entity1 and plumped for brights courtesy of a cream coat and a tangerine @entity50 hat , while princess @entity17 plumped for pale and interesting in a beige trench coat and a matching pillbox hat by @entity76 milliner , @entity75			2
glamorous though the @entity79 princesses were , all eyes were on the princess royal who joined them in the carriage and looked marvellous in a fuchsia titfer and a navy blue coat delicately patterned with flowers			2
despite her losses on the field , the @entity1 did at least have prince @entity35 on hand to entertain her and he did - jinking across the @entity89 , twirling an umbrella in his hand , and regaling his family with tales			1
commiserations : the @entity1 is reflected in the @entity4 as she prepares to present it to the owner of @entity8 after her horse estimate came second beautiful : princess @entity17 was pretty in a hat by @entity76 milliner @entity75 while princess @entity16 opted for a glamorous tangerine hat by @entity50 glamorous : a smiling @entity0 was glamorous in a dramatic all - black ensemble as she joined prince @entity35 and the @entity1 in the @entity89 looking good : prince @entity34 was dapper in morning dress , while @entity103 looked lovely in navy and pink , and princess @entity16 in a tangering ensemble wonderful : princess @entity103 was elegant in a bright pink hat enlivened with marabou feathers and beading , a matching pink shift dress , and a pared down navy jacket day out : the princess royal , who has been at @entity30 every day , was joined by her nieces @entity16 and @entity17 for the ride down the racecourse joker : prince @entity35 's antics kept his grandparents and uncle prince @entity34 entertained as they drove along the course - and he carried on in the @entity89 also on hand for the fun was @entity122 who laughed along with prince @entity35 as they cheered on @entity124 in the @entity125 before bursting into laughter as he dropped the trophy during the subsequent presentation			1
and while she might not have won , the @entity1 , who later presented leading @entity8 's owners with the @entity4 , does at least have happy memories of last year 's race - and wrote glowingly of her experiences in last year 's event in the official foreword to the @entity30 programme , ' i would like to thank those of you who were here for the wonderful welcome the filly received after performing so well , and also those who were kind enough to send messages afterwards , ' she wrote			2
' to win at @entity30 is challenging and i know how much work goes into preparing every one of the horses racing			0
all those involved deserve great credit as well as our gratitude			0
' and the @entity1 certainly does know a considerable amount about readying racehorses for action , thanks to a career as a breeder and owner that spans more than 60 years			0
since inheriting a handful of animals on her father 's death in 1952 , her horses have since triumphed in more than 1600 races , including all five @entity164 classics apart from the @entity165 , although did manage a second place finish with @entity167 in 1953 and came third in 2011 with @entity168			0
while the @entity165 has so far eluded her , the @entity1 has bred some of the finest horses ever to race in the @entity164 , among them @entity172 who managed to win both the @entity174 and @entity175 in 1977 , @entity176 , who triumphed in the @entity174 in 1957 and @entity177 who took the @entity179 in 1958			0
enjoying himself : prince @entity35 makes a lady guest laugh ( left ) and right , twirls his umbrella with a cheeky grin on his face as he strolls through the @entity89 all smiles : prince @entity35 , dapper in morning dress jazzed up with a cornflower blue tie , laughed and joked with his uncle , prince @entity34 winning ways : @entity8 ( far right with a blaze ) streaks past @entity23 ( centre , sheepskin noseband ) to take the @entity4 on @entity37 at @entity30 winning ways : @entity124 leaps from @entity194 after the pair triumphed in the @entity125 watched by @entity35 and the @entity1 enjoying themselves : ladies stop to chat as they enjoy their day out at @entity30 , with one lady looking particularly elegant in a pink lace dress and matching titfer exciting stuff : colourfully dressed racegoers sit in the @entity202 as they wait for the racing action to begin , starting with the @entity125 smart : a lady dressed in an all - crimson ensemble topped with a black hat , left , and right , a dapper gentleman in morning dress and his equally well - dressed companion green and pleasant land : racegoers stroll towards the course along a pretty tree - lined avenue festooned with @entity217 flag bunting on @entity37 wonderful : the sun shone on @entity219 's @entity30 as excited guests arrived for @entity12 and the chance to see @entity23 compete in the @entity4			1

@entity1 , who was elegant in turquoise , was accompanied by the @entity31 and prince @entity34
behind them rode @entity226 and @entity17 , the princess royal and her son @entity122
prince @entity35 , on *typically* jokey form , set about entertaining the ladies as they watched the races
unfortunately for the @entity1 , her filly estimate could only manage second place in the @entity4
colourfully dressed racegoers lined the *grandstand* and filled the *paddock* , with *outlandish* hats *dominating*
