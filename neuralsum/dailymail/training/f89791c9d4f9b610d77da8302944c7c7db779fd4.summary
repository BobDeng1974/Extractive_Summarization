praising children with phrases such as ‘ well done darling ’ may damage their confidence , a leading psychologist has warned			1
@entity5 claims that comments such as ‘ you ’re so clever ’ or ‘ you ’re such an artist ’ could also hinder their future performance at school			1
he says that such ‘ empty praise ’ causes children to be unhappy as they feel they can not live up to the false expectations			1
more harm than good : praising your children can damage their confidence according to a leading psychoanalyst instead he advises parents and teachers to bestow compliments less frequently and use phrases that congratulate children for ‘ trying really hard ’			2
mr @entity5 – who has practised as a psychoanalyst , a type of psychologist , for 25 years – said : ‘ empty praise is as bad as thoughtless criticism – it expresses indifference to the child ’s feelings and thoughts			1
‘ admiring our children may temporarily lift our sense of self - esteem but it is n’t doing much for a child ’s sense of self			2
’ he also cites research showing that children who were heavily praised were likely to perform worse at school			1
psychologists from @entity43 asked 128 pupils aged ten and 11 to solve a number of maths problems afterwards , some were told : ‘ you did really well – you ’re so clever			0
’ but the researchers told the other group , ‘ you did really well – you must have tried really hard			0
’ both groups of children were then given more difficult questions and those who had been told they were clever did not do as well as the others			2
in fact , the researchers found they even tried to lie about their results when asked about the experiment			0
mr @entity5 has written a book about human behaviour , @entity63 , which includes a chapter entitled how praise can cause @entity66			1
he says that when collecting his daughter from a nursery near their home in @entity71 , he heard an assistant tell her : ‘ you ’ve drawn the most beautiful tree			0
’ later , after she had done another drawing , the same assistant said : ‘ wow , you really are an artist			0
’ in his book , mr @entity5 writes : ‘ my heart sank			1
' how could i explain to the nursery assistant that i would prefer it if she did n’t praise my daughter ? ’ he added : ‘ if you go to the local nursery you ’ll hear this kind of stuff sometimes mixed in with teaching : ‘ ‘ oh , your drawing looks so like a @entity91 , darling ’ ’ [ the @entity93 painter and sculptor ]			2
‘ and so you get this mix of praise and teaching			2
i find it , to be blunt , aggressive			0
' because it ’s saying : i do n’t want to engage with you as a person ; i want to just praise you			0
’ mr @entity5 believes that many adults were heavily criticised when they were young and are now anxious to show they are different			1
but instead of overpraising children , he said parents should try to build their confidence gently			0
‘ just listen to what your child wants to tell you , about what they ’re interested in and what they ’re passionate about , ’ he added .			0
