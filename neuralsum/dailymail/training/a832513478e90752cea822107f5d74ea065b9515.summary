a concert pianist had demanded that a review of a 2010 concert he gave be removed from internet search results under the @entity5 ' right to be forgotten ' law			1
@entity7 , a performer from @entity8 , said that a ' defamatory ' review of his performance in @entity11 should not appear alongside @entity13 searches for his name because it is ' opinionated ' and ' mean - spirited '			1
@entity7 wrote to the @entity15 , which published the review by classical music writer @entity17 , to have the article removed from search results			1
complaint : @entity7 , a @entity8 concert pianist , demanded that the @entity15 remove a review of a concert he gave four years ago from search results he called the review : ' @entity25 , mean - spirited , opinionated , one - sided , offensive [ and ] simply irrelevant for the arts ' - despite the fact that the original piece is in many places complimentary			1
in the original article , @entity17 said that his performance was lackluster given his huge talents , and prone to ' grandiloquence '			0
she wrote : ' it 's not that @entity35 is n't sensitive - or profoundly gifted ... the sheer technical ability was , at first , a delight			0
' soon , though , all of the finesse started to seem like an end in itself ... there were fine moments , but they stubbornly refused to add up to anything more than a self - conscious display of @entity45			0
' @entity7 insisted that his request was ' nothing to do with censorship ' , but a response to the fact that newspaper reviews are ' too far from the truth '			1
' defamed ' : @entity7 - who denies he is trying to censor his history - said the review was ' mean - spirited ' and ' opinionated ' he was attempting to invoke a @entity56 law which regulates search engines and lets @entity56 citizens request to have links removed from search results if the information is deemed ' inadequate , irrelevant or â€¦ excessive			1
' however , the request was misplaced as search engines themselves , not publishers , enact the law			0
the @entity15 said the request was a ' troubling ' example of the rules in action			2
the request was the first the @entity15 has ever received , according to the publisher			0
@entity7 insisted his request ' has nothing to do with censorship ' , but complained that he thinks reviews are usually ' too far from the truth '			2
search engines - chiefly @entity13 - fought the ruling in the @entity5 courts , but was forced to comply and has removed links to outlets including the @entity81 , the @entity82 and the @entity83			2
since then thousands of articles have been removed from hundreds of publishers , which received a notification that their pages will no longer appear on @entity5 versions of search engine sites			0
in some cases the complaints have been made not be the primary subject of an article but by those mentioned in passing , or even people who have left comments underneath stories which they want hidden .			0
