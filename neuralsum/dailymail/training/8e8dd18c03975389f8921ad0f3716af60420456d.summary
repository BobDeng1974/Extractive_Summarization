the three - year - old boy who recently heard for the first time in his life has already started making sounds and loves nothing more than listening to music , it was revealed today			0
@entity7 made headlines across the world this week when a video showing his reaction after he heard his father 's voice for the first time was released			1
this came after he received a breakthrough auditory brain stem implant when a normal cochlear implant failed			1
his parents @entity19 and @entity20 said today that in the few weeks since the device was implanted , @entity7 has started making sounds for the first time in his life			1
' he needs to experience as much sounds as possible to get used to them and associate them with an object , ' adding that the three - year - old loves listening to all types of music			0
@entity19 spoke of her joy at watching her son experience sound for the first time			0
what 's all that noise ? 3 - year - old @entity7 hears for the first time @entity7 's face ' lit up ' the first time he could hear his father ' it was a huge sense of relief for me , just overwhelming			2
seeing it work was the culmination of a long journey			0
' @entity20 added : ' it was validation of the plan that @entity36 set out for our lives and for @entity7 's life			2
we got an overwhelming sense that @entity36 was with us			0
@entity7 's parents tried everything to help their deaf three - year - old son hear throughout his short life before they turned to the untested method that had never been used on a child in the @entity82 before			1
after the chip was implanted in his brain , @entity7 - who was adopted by the clamps as a newborn after he was placed in foster care - could hear for the first time in his life			1
medical breakthrough : clamp was the first child in the @entity82 to receive an auditory brain stem implant surgery : to implant the device that now allows him to hear , @entity7 had to undergo brain surgery ' we do n't know exactly what it 's like for him , ' @entity92 told @entity100			1

after the cochlear implant failed , the @entity110 decided to participate in a research trial at @entity113 in @entity114 , @entity115 , where doctors were researching the use of the implant on children			2
auditory brain stem implants have been used on adults in the @entity82 since 1979			1
but researchers have never before tested the device on children - although , it is approved for use on children in @entity126			0
the procedure requires doctors to implant a microchip into a patient 's brain			2
the microchip then helps him recognize and process sound			0
the technology is similar to that of a cochlear implant - using electrical stimulation - the brain stem implant uses electrical impulses to stimulate the brain , rather than the cochlea			1
to date , roughly 1,000 people have undergone the procedure , with varying degrees of success - most recipients of the implant only have an awareness of sound			1
it 's described as being able to hear the beat , but not the melody			0
