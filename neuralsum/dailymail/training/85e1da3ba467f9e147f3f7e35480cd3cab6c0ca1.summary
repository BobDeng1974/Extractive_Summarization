' no one in the restaurant where the incident occurred contacted police but the investigation is ongoing			0
because this is a possible sexual battery case , we are not in a position to release more information at this time			0

however @entity233 , a criminal law professor at the @entity235 @entity234 , points out that this is a far from a straightforward case			0
he told @entity217 : ' technically a prosecutor does not need a victim to prosecute a crime , as long as there is other evidence sufficient to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt			0
' but although it is possible to obtain a conviction in a case like this without a victim , it will be difficult to do so			0
a jury may not take the case very seriously if there is no victim willing to testify			0
' in this case , as reprehensible as the conduct may appear to some , others may see it as merely a crude college prank which does not rise to the level of criminal behavior			0
' that perspective will only be reinforced if the victim does not care enough about the case to come forward			0
given this challenge , a prosecutor â€™s office may be reluctant to commit their scarce resources to prosecuting such a case			0
