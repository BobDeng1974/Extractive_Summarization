as the tallest building in @entity2 , it demands a grand opening ceremony to match its imposing presence			1
and if last night 's dress rehearsal is an indication , the @entity5 will dazzle the skies above @entity9 when it officially opens its doors tomorrow night			1
the run - through featured a light show using lasers and searchlight beams that crossed over its neighbouring city skyscrapers			1
the @entity5 is fully clad in glass , so the sun 's rays on a cloudless day give it the appearance of a shining beacon			1
it has 95 floors and is tipped with a gleaming spire			0
@entity37 will include a hotel , restaurant , viewing platform , flats and offices			0
work on the landmark began in february 2009 and an estimated £ 450million has been spent on its construction			0
the building offers uninterrupted 360 - degree views of the capital , on a clear day stretching for 40 miles in every direction			0
dazzling : the run - through featured a light show using lasers and searchlight beams that crossed over the @entity5 's @entity55 skyscrapers visitors will be able to enjoy the view from an observatory that will be 72 floors up			1
billed as a ‘ vertical city ’ , it will comprise offices up to floor 28 , then three floors of restaurants ; a five - star 19 - storey hotel of 200 rooms ; ten apartments over 12 floors – each seven times larger than a semi-detached house and likely to fetch tens of millions of pounds each ; and , finally , the observatory and spire			0
designed by @entity74 @entity73 to resemble an iceberg emerging from the @entity76 , the @entity5 has not been without controversy			2
@entity78 has expressed fears about the ‘ major and detrimental ’ impact on views of @entity82 , the @entity83 and the @entity84			0
finishing touches : work on the landmark began in february 2009 and an estimated £ 450million has been spent on its construction unmissable : sunlight reflects off the almost - completed @entity5 at the end of may as construction continued on the building almost finished : the @entity5 , pictured as it nears completion five weeks ago , is fully clad in glass - so when the sun shines on a cloudless day , it gives it the appearance of a shining beacon			2
