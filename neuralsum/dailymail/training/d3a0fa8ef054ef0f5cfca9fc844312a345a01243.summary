@entity2 told reporters outside the @entity10 it was a ' special day ' , adding that she felt positive the inquiry would begin on schedule next january			2
earlier in the hearing , the inquiry 's chair sir @entity14 praised the widow for her patience in the face of ' highly regrettable ' delays			1
her husband , who fled to @entity21 in 2000 , was poisoned with radioactive polonium - 210 while drinking tea with two @entity25 men , one a former @entity27 officer , at the @entity28 in @entity30 ’s @entity29 in 2006			1
he told the hearing that alleged @entity25 state responsibility in the 43 - year - old ’s death was of ' central importance to my investigation '			1
sir @entity14 explained that @entity21 ’s responsibility for protecting the former @entity27 officer would not be investigated as there was no evidence to suggest any failings on the state ’s part			1

progress : she added that she was ' confident ' the inquiry will open on schedule next january success : the public inquiry , which formally opened in @entity30 today , was announced when ms @entity2 challenged opposition from the government and the home secretary in the @entity73 submission : ms @entity75 did admit that some parts of the inquiry will remain secret and she may never know the content of some of the evidence he said : ' because of the sensitivity of @entity71 ’s evidence it is inevitable that at least some of my final report will also have to remain secret but i make it clear now that i intend to make public my final conclusions on the issue of @entity25 state responsibility together with as much as possible of my reasoning in that regard			1
' the government had previously resisted launching a public inquiry , and instead said it would ' wait and see ' what a judge - led inquest found			2
but ms @entity2 challenged this and the @entity73 ruled that the home secretary must reconsider the decision			0
an inquiry will allow investigators to probe whether the @entity25 state was behind the former @entity27 officer ’s murder			2

' she added : ' everybody around the world will know the truth			0
' asked if she thought last week ’s announcement was due to the strained political situation with @entity25 , she said the ' political situation ' may have contributed to it , but she did not think there had been any ' political involvement ' in the process			0
she added that she had always been aware parts of the inquiry would have to be in secret , and admitted she may never know the content of some of the evidence submitted to the inquiry			0
