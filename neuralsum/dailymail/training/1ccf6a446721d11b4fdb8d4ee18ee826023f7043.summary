click here to see which famous faces turned out to watch the game @entity3 led the way with 22 points from the bench as the @entity7 thrashed the @entity8 95 - 79 in front of a sold - out crowd of over 18,500 at the @entity11			1
the 27 - year - old guard was one of five @entity7 players in double figures as they cruised past the @entity8 on thursday night in @entity15			1
@entity16 also had 20 points , while @entity18 ( 16 ) , @entity19 ( 14 ) and @entity20 ( 11 ) also reached double figures in another impressive team performance by @entity24 ’s side			1
the defeat for the @entity8 was their 16th in a row and 26th in their last 27 matches			2
it was also a third straight loss against the @entity7 this season			1
‘ we have to work harder than what we are and put more time and effort in to get the results that we want			0
‘ we have played against this team four times including pre-season and they ’re just better than us			2
’ thursday night ’s game was the fifth regular - season contest to be staged at the arena in south @entity15 since 2011 , and one of the most one - sided			1
two years is a very long time in basketball			0
in january 2013 , the @entity8 came to @entity15 and brushed aside a @entity60 side 102 - 87 on their way to finishing second behind the @entity62 in the @entity63			1
this team is not even a shadow of that side , and they return home with their league - worst record at a dire 5 - 36 with their next win seemingly a world away			2
even the return of @entity40 - their superstar player – from injury could n’t keep things close against a young , dynamic @entity7 side that moved to 21 - 19 for the season and remained well and truly on course for a play - off spot in the @entity63			1
@entity15 fans will at least be happy that @entity40 was on the court after making the long trip over having missed the previous six games with a knee injury			2
@entity40 played 27 minutes and scored 25 points , but they were all in vain for the @entity87 gold medallist			0
it was a superstar ’s performance from @entity40 in a losing effort in front of some football superstars , including @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96			1
but @entity40 ’s efforts were nowhere near enough for this struggling @entity8 team on thursday at the @entity11			1
@entity99 legend @entity93 looks less than impressed with @entity100 ahead of the game the stage is set by cheerleaders at the @entity11 for the fifth regular season @entity32 game to be staged in @entity15 since 2011 @entity7 so - called ' @entity105 ' @entity18 ( right ) holds off @entity106 of the @entity8 @entity8 ' star @entity40 ( centre ) was back in action after missing the last six games in a recent injury lay - off @entity112 ( top ) of the @entity8 shoots against @entity7 @entity114 as the @entity8 make a brief comeback @entity40 ( left ) of the @entity8 looks to pass while @entity7 @entity16 heads for the basket for the @entity8 , the damage was done early , very early , and there was no way back			1
just three minutes into the game , an alley - oop pass from @entity16 to ‘ @entity105 freek ’ @entity123 had the @entity7 off to a 12 - 0 head start , and with just give minutes played , @entity8 head coach @entity125 had already burned two timeouts with his team 14 - 0 behind			1
‘ it is just a recurring act , ’ @entity40 said			0
‘ the same things are happening over and over again			0
i was n’t expecting to be 14 points down but it happened and we are the only people who can control that			0
‘ we have dug ourselves in a deep hole right now , so the only thing we can do is keep trying to get better			0
’ @entity112 finally got the @entity8 on the board midway through the first quarter and it sparked a 7 - 0 run that got @entity8 back within touching distance			2
but a 12 - 0 run towards the end of the period propelled the @entity7 into what seemed like an already unassailable 31 - 13 lead at the end of the first quarter			2
already , at that stage , it was just a matter of how many the @entity7 would win by			2

to have any chance of getting back into the game , @entity8 needed to start the second half fast and eat away at @entity7 ’s big lead			1
but it was the @entity7 who kept their foot firmly on the accelerator , scoring the first six points of the third quarter , by the end of which their lead had stretched to 82 - 56			1
coach @entity125 decided enough was enough for @entity40 on his return for injury			0
after playing 27 minutes in three periods , his night was done with the @entity8 ’ chances of victory gone			2
‘ he had n’t played for a couple weeks and with the knee situation we were trying to be as smart as possible there , ’ @entity125 said about pulling @entity40			0
‘ with the game where it was i thought it was a good time to give him a rest			0
’ @entity40 added : ‘ i feel my body responded very well			0
i had a chance to get some rest and the two - week programme we implemented at the beginning of the year really paid off			0
’ ‘ it was regular rotation at the end of the third quarter and then it was a coach decision but overall i felt pretty good			0

it was a third straight win for @entity7 head coach @entity24 at the @entity11 having been a @entity8 player in 2013 , and coach of the @entity220 in 2014 for their victories in @entity15			1
‘ i love the international atmosphere , ’ @entity24 said			0
