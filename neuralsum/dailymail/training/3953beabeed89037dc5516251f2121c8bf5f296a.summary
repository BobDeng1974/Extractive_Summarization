a 17 - year - old cancer patient has said she understands ' death is the outcome ' but that it is ' my life and my body ' after being told she must undergo chemotherapy treatment by a court			1
the court said @entity9 , from @entity10 , was not legally mature enough to decide whether she should have the life - saving care			1
doctors said the chemotherapy would give her an 85 per cent chance of survival , but without it there was a near - certainty of death within two years			1
a state @entity20 has ruled that 17 - year - old cancer patient @entity9 must have chemotherapy the teen says she understands ' death is the outcome ' of refusing treatment , but that it should be her decision several other states recognize the ' mature minor doctrine ' , but the court said she did not understand the severity of her condition			1
she will have to wait until she turns 18 in september before she can make her own medical decisions			2
@entity9 , who has @entity33 , is currently confined in a room at @entity35 in @entity36 , where she is being forced to undergo chemotherapy			1
this is despite the teen saying she should be able to decide whether she undergoes the treatment or not and understands that ' death is the outcome ' believing in the ' quality of my life , not the quantity '			1
writing for the @entity47 , she said : ' this experience has been a continuous nightmare			0
i want the right to make my medical decisions			2
' it 's disgusting that i 'm fighting for a right that i and anyone in my situation should already have			2
' this is my life and my body , not @entity59 's and not the state 's			1
i am a human â€” i should be able to decide if i do or do n't want chemotherapy			2
whether i live 17 years or 100 years should not be anyone 's choice but mine			2
' she added : ' i believe there 's a natural way or at least an alternative to chemo out there that i am willing to look for and explore			2
not that it would cure the cancer but it may help it			0
' her mother , @entity72 ( right ) , stands outside the @entity74 in @entity36 , with @entity75 , 51 , a @entity10 woman who said she has survived brain cancer without chemotherapy ms @entity9 said : ' she has always - even years ago - said that if she was diagnosed with cancer , she would not put poison into her body ' @entity9 is currently at the @entity81 ( pictured ) undergoing treatment @entity33 is cancer of the white blood cells called b lymphocytes that circulate around the lymphatic system , which is a network of vessels and glands spread throughout the body			1
the lymphatic system is part of your immune system			0
@entity96 fluid called lymph flows through the lymphatic vessels and contains infection - fighting white blood cells known as lymphocytes			2
lymphoma causes the lymphocytes to multiply in an abnormal way and collect in certain parts of the lymphatic system , such as the lymph nodes or glands			0
these lymphocytes lose their infection - fighting properties , making you more vulnerable to infection			0
the most common symptom of @entity33 is a painless swelling in a lymph node , usually in the neck , armpit or groin			0
it usually affects young adults aged between 15 and 35 and adults over the age of 50			0
the cause is unknown but risk factors include medical conditiona that weakens your immune system , taking immunosuppressant medication and being previously exposed to the @entity128 ( which causes glandular fever )			0
it is n't thought a family member having the disease increases the chances of developing it			0
the only way to confirm a diagnosis of @entity33 is by carrying out a biopsy			0
almost all young people with @entity33 will be fully cured			0
for older people over the age of 50 , the cure rate is around 75 per cent to 80 per cent			0
treatment depends on the extent of the cancer and will usually involve a combination of radiotherapy , chemotherapy and drugs including steroids			2
@entity35 recommended she receive chemotherapy after she was diagnosed with @entity33 's lymphoma last september			1
but when the adolescent refused , with her mother 's support , the state 's @entity152 ( @entity59 ) intervened			1
@entity9 was allowed to go home to undergo treatment in november but was so distressed she ran away for a week			1
she was then taken in to custody by the @entity59			0
she was then returned to @entity35 and ordered to start chemo			1
with the support of her mother , @entity72 , of @entity164 , she refused any more when she returned			0
she said she wanted to seek alternative treatments that did not involve putting the ' poison ' of chemotherapy in to her body			2
after the hospital reported ms @entity9 , the @entity59 took temporary custody of the teen and her mother was ordered to cooperate with medical care			1
her treatment resumed on december 17 , with surgery to install in her chest a port used to administer the drugs , with chemotherapy resuming the next day			1
describing the treatment , @entity9 wrote in the @entity47 : ' after a week , they decided to force chemotherapy on me			1
i should have had the right to say no , but i did n't			0
' i was strapped to a bed by my wrists and ankles and sedated			1
i woke up in the recovery room with a port surgically placed in my chest			0
i was outraged and felt completely violated			0
my phone was taken away , the hospital phone was removed from my room and even the scissors i used for art were taken			0
i have been locked in this hospital for a month , missing time from work , not being able to pay my bills			0
i could n't celebrate @entity198 and @entity199 's with my friends and family			0
' at the @entity20 hearing , child welfare agency officials defended their treatment of @entity9 , saying they have a responsibility to protect her			1
' this is a curable illness , and we will continue to ensure that @entity9 receives the treatment she needs to become a healthy and happy adult , ' they said			1
her mother and lawyer say they are considering their next step but expect to return to the trial court to more fully explore the mature minor argument .			1
