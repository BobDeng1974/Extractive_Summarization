before the match , @entity0 denied his position was bombproof and it required a spectacular missile from @entity4 to stop yet more flak being aimed in the direction of the @entity8 manager			1
@entity4 ’s overhead strike — as good as you ’ll see in any league all season — arrived early and , despite a high quota of chances at both ends , was enough to see the @entity17 club maintain their six - point distance from @entity20 leaders @entity21			1
defeat last monday night had brought @entity0 ’s position into question and , had @entity24 displayed the same assurance in front of goal as @entity28 , the fortitude of the @entity8 boss ’s tenure may indeed have been put to the test			1
@entity4 's stunning overhead kick was enough to secure a @entity8 win at the @entity34 @entity4 ( left ) celebrates his goal with @entity8 team - mate @entity36 @entity8 ' @entity4 pumps the air after his match - winning goal against @entity24 in the championship @entity24 : @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 ( @entity44 27 ) , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity42 , @entity48 ( @entity49 86 ) , @entity50 ( @entity51 74 ) , @entity52 , @entity53 subs not used : @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 booked : @entity50 63 , @entity44 67 @entity8 : @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 ( @entity62 45 ) , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 ( @entity66 73 ) , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity4 , @entity36 , @entity69 ( @entity70 65 ) subs not used : @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 goal : @entity4 8 booked : @entity64 7 , @entity4 60 , referee : @entity78 attendance : 5,924 equally , the mysterious boardroom machinations at @entity17 might prove a continued source of security for the manager			1
last week ’s headline news saw @entity85 increase his holding to 8.9 per cent but the @entity88 owner made his investment outwith the recent open share offer , thus denying the club working capital — and quite possibly the cash reserves that would be required to fulfil severance obligations , should they be required			0
for now , @entity0 continues to plod on and , if @entity8 lack the momentum that keeps @entity21 rolling on at the top , they just about recovered their balance to edge out a @entity24 team that left the field with their share of regret at missed chances			1
@entity8 ’ starting line - up featured five changes ; those who survived monday ’s 3 - 1 defeat could consider themselves fortunate			2
@entity111 was the one obligatory change , courtesy of a retrospective two - match ban offered by the @entity115 after he hit out at @entity28 defender @entity117			1
a bandaged @entity24 captain @entity46 challenges @entity8 ' @entity69 @entity8 manager @entity0 looks on during the @entity20 match at the @entity34 @entity62 , @entity72 , @entity119 and @entity74 were all dropped with @entity4 , @entity60 , @entity120 , @entity36 and @entity111 ’s replacement @entity61 given the chance to impress			1
one theory attached to @entity8 ’ ascent through the divisions is that it has occurred without the need for any real tactical masterplan from @entity0 and his staff			2
it ’s certainly true that you can not coach the sort of natural ability utilised by @entity4			2
a heart complaint limited the exciting midfielder ’s involvement during the team ’s @entity137 campaign but this was a strike to set everyone ’s pulses racing			0
@entity8 goalscorer @entity4 battles with @entity24 's @entity143 @entity24 's @entity144 is checked by the referee after receiving a heavy blow to the face credit in the first instance to @entity120 , who pressed @entity24 midfielder @entity42 deep into his own territory where he conceded possession			1
as the home team attempted to clear their lines and restore a high defensive line from the throw , @entity68 returned the ball high towards the back post			0
everyone else had raced out but @entity4 , having checked he was onside at the point of delivery , remained in situ and adjusted his feet for the most acrobatic of finishes — an overhead volley that would have graced any occasion			1
had @entity24 displayed even half of @entity4 ’s conviction they might have taken something from the match			1
@entity50 had squandered a chance to draw first blood when he lost composure with a clear sight on goal and scooped his shot high			0
former @entity21 player @entity178 was also weak with a first - time effort although he could n’t have been warmed up , having been forced into action as a replacement for @entity144 after the tall defender had been stretchered off after taking a @entity67 shot full in the face			0
having started as the better team , the home side were penned in towards half - time and @entity43 ’s block was not the only last - gasp intervention — skipper @entity46 twice denied @entity69 and @entity189 stretched to thwart @entity65 in the act of shooting			2
@entity69 ( left ) battles with @entity24 's @entity189 during the match @entity8 manager @entity0 ( second right ) and assistant @entity195 ( right ) applaud the goal the case of @entity69 gets curiouser by the week			1
having scored 22 goals for @entity202 side @entity200 last season , he was expected to blitz the @entity20 but has laboured and remains goalless after eight starts			1
one moment just after the break summed up his season to date			0
as @entity60 drove towards the byeline the striker made his trademark move to the penalty spot and prepared for the cut - back			0
when it duly arrived , he missed the ball completely with his once deadly right boot			0
eventually , @entity0 ’s patience gave way and so did @entity69 , for @entity70			2
@entity8 still had enough chances to wrap up the game before enduring a nervy close			0
@entity63 had a shot pushed over by @entity41 and @entity36 blasted over after being provided with an open goal chance by @entity64			0
by the end it was @entity24 asking the more serious questions			2
@entity52 came close with a low drive but it was @entity189 who caused panic among the @entity8 support			0
first he drove a long - range effort into the side - netting and then climbed to head an effort that required @entity68 to knock off the line			2
@entity24 protested furiously that the ball had crossed the line			0
@entity0 simply breathed a sigh of relief .			0

rangers were well - beaten by @entity28 on monday and @entity0 's side came into the game under considerable pressure from fans
the @entity17 outfit were much improved for this game , and a single goal from @entity4 was enough to secure three points
@entity4 's goal was a stunning overhead kick in the eighth minute
rangers remain second in the @entity20 , while @entity24 are struggling in eighth
