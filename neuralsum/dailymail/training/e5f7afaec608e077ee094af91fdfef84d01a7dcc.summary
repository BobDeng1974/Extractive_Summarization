a doctor has recorded the moment he delivered a baby inside an intact amniotic sac			1
obstetrician dr @entity4 published the photo of the newborn on his @entity8 page after delivering the baby via caesarean section in @entity10 , north of @entity11			1
because the sac had not been punctured , dr @entity4 said the baby did not even realise it had been born and behaved as if it was still inside the mother 's womb			1
a glimpse into the womb : this astonishing photograph , taken by obstetrician dr @entity4 , shows the baby who was delivered inside an intact amniotic sac			1
until the sac is punctured the baby will behave as if it is still inside its mother the amniotic sac is a bag of fluid inside the womb where the unborn baby develops and grows			1
it is also referred to as the ‘ membranes ’ , because the sac is made of two membranes called the amnion and the chorion			2
the sac is filled with clear , pale fluid , in which the unborn baby floats and moves			1
the fluid helps to cushion the baby from bumps and injury , as well as providing them with fluids that they can breathe and swallow			1
the fluid also maintains a constant temperature for the baby			2
the amniotic sac starts to form and fill with fluid within days of a woman conceiving			1
amniotic fluid is mainly water but from about week 10 onwards , the baby passes small amounts of urine into the fluid			2
an amniotic sac develops just days after a woman conceives ( pictured 40 days into pregnancy )			1
it is filled with fluid which cushions the baby from bumps and nourishes it the amount of amniotic fluid increases gradually during pregnancy until about week 38 , when it reduces slightly until the baby is born			2
@entity62 's daughter @entity61 was born inside the amniotic sac in 2011 typically the amniotic sac breaks on its own during birth , which is commonly referred to as a mother 's ‘ water breaking ’			1
dr tsigris that the chance of the amniotic sac remaining completely intact after birth was ‘ ultra rare ’ and he was left ‘ breathless ’ by the sight of the newborn born on march 12 , according to a report by @entity74			1
the doctor said there was no risk to the baby as it was still feeding off the placenta and would begin to breathe as soon as the sac was broken			1
the photo has since been shared more than 8000 times			0
actress @entity62 has spoken out about her daughter @entity61 who was born inside the amniotic sac in 2011			1
she said at the time : ‘ the doctor had never seen anything like it before			0
he grabbed the nurse and said : “ look at this ! ”			0
' i was in the middle of pushing and he told me to hold on a minute and not to push			0
' he was wearing basketball shorts and a t - shirt and said : ‘ oh i have to get my scrubs on for this ! ’ the sac burst on its own after she came out			2
' in fact @entity62 ’s experience inspired @entity61 ’s name			1
she explained : ‘ when i was in recovery we still had n’t chosen her name			0
[ her father @entity106 ] picked her up and said she came into the world in her ‘ safe haven ’ and [ her name ] clicked right then for both of us			0
’ being born ' with the caul ' occurs when a child is delivered with a portion of amniotic membrane on their face			2
' @entity118 ' literally means ' helmeted head ' or ' veil '			0
a baby with the caul is called the ' caulbearer '			2
being born with the caul in medieval times was interpreted as a sign of good luck and that the child was destined for greatness			0
saving the caul was considered an important tradition of childbirth			0
the midwife would rub a sheet of paper across the baby 's head and face , pressing the material of the caul onto the paper			0
it would then be presented to the mother , to be kept as an heirloom			0
other traditions have linked the caul to fertility and some say it protects a person from the forces of evil , such as witches and sorcerers			0
being born ' en caul ' is the term used when the child is born within an intact amniotic sac , which occurred in the story above			1
it is also known as a ' veiled birth '			0
most en caul births occur in premature babies			0
some legends suggest that being born en caul means you will never drown			0
statistics relating to such births are sparse , but deliveries involving any form of caul are thought to occur in roughly one in 80,000 births .			0

@entity167 obstetrician dr @entity4 posted the image on @entity8
usually the sac breaks during birth , a process known as ' waters breaking '
dr @entity4 said that the ' ultra rare ' *phenomenon* took his breath away
the baby was not in danger because it would not need to breathe for itself until the amniotic sac was broken , the placenta removed and the cord cut
actress @entity62 gave birth in same way and the experience inspired name of her daughter @entity61 , now 2
