by @entity1 reporter published : 16:55 est , 7 january 2013 updated : 16:58 est , 7 january 2013 hundreds of president @entity3 supporters were today left frustrated and disappointed after a computer glitch denied them any chance of attending the inaugural ball that was open to the public			1
tickets for the black tie event at @entity10 on january 21 were scheduled to go on sale on monday morning			0
then a technical mistake by distributor @entity13 meant that all available entries were snapped up on sunday night , before they were even meant to be on sale			1
guilty conscience : @entity13 emailed some customers to say that they had ' inadvertently ' put ball tickets on sale a day early @entity13 emailed everyone who had registered an interest on sunday , telling them that at some point on monday they would receive a unique link			1
this would allow them to enter the ' first - come , first served ' contest to buy a maximum of two tickets at $ 60 each			0
on sunday night , however , @entity13 mistakenly sent out the link to the purchase page and began selling tickets			1
@entity13 later sent a follow - up email confessing to the problem			1
' during testing of our email system tonight , you may have inadvertently received an invitation to purchase tickets for 2013 @entity42 events , including the @entity43 or the @entity44 , ' read the message			2
what you could have won : president @entity3 and the @entity48 dance at an inaugural ball in 2009 ' public tickets to these events were originally scheduled to go on sale tomorrow morning - you received the email tonight in error , and @entity13 takes responsibility for this mistake			1
' the note continued : ' a significant number of public tickets were purchased this evening , despite the early email			1
@entity13 will be in touch with any additional information			2
' then came the crunch : ' all tickets are first - come , first - served including those sold tonight			0
there is no guarantee that you will be able to purchase a ticket at any time			0
' customers that tried to login at this point were shown a count of zero tickets on the system			2
and those who tried to buy tickets in the morning were told that they were no longer available			0
some registered customers got all the emails , some received a mixture , while others got nothing at all			0
many were left frustrated by the episode , feeling cheated that they had n't had a fair chance of purchasing tickets			0
feeling cheated ? the message users got when they signed in on the day tickets were supposed to be put on sale june @entity91 , a retired assistant @entity92 attorney , told the @entity93 : ' i stayed up four hours doing this			2
' she added that @entity13 and the @entity42 should void the all sales and start again to ensure a fair process			2
the request to start again was echoed many times on the @entity101 , where hundreds of users vented their frustration			0
many people were angry with the circumstances and a perceived lack of official recognition			0
other users expressed annoyance with @entity13 and doubts that the company should ever have been trusted with the ball tickets in the first place			1
more suspicious customers felt sure that the chance to attend the ball had been fixed , to only allow access to chosen and well - connected members of the public			1
historic occasion : president @entity121 and @entity122 leave the @entity123 to attend a series of five balls in 1961			0

@entity13 computer glitch ' inadvertently ' begins to sell tickets for the public inaugural ball a day too early
*potential* customers vent frustration at ' *unfair* *treatment* '
