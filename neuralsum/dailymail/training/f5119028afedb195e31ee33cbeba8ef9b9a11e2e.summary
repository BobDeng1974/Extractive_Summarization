by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 goes into the most important club game of his career this afternoon hoping that he can find his cape and be ready to fly on another grand occasion			1
the @entity8 wing arrived at @entity9 last summer with a reluctant superhero ’s aura , acquired on the strength of his stirring deeds for the @entity14 in @entity15			1
in his first season for the @entity18 , the 22 - year - old has moved heaven and earth to live up to his reputation and while his club are delighted with his endeavours , he has found it hard to fulfil his billing on a weekly basis			1
d - day : @entity9 's @entity2 prepares to take on @entity28 in the @entity30 final on saturday superman : @entity2 will be relied upon when @entity9 face @entity28 in the @entity30 final great expectations : @entity2 earned his reputation for his heroics on @entity14 tour of @entity36 ‘ coming here , it ’s like @entity31 — my @entity41 is the fact that i ca n’t get myself going every time , ’ he said ahead of saturday ’s @entity30 final against @entity28 at @entity38			1
‘ the season is so long and it ’s been tough just trying to stay in one piece			2
‘ off the back of the @entity14 , i have come with a bit of expectation on my head			1
i sometimes feel like i have n’t done as much as i was hoping and i ’ve been marked out of some games			2
‘ i ’m my own worst critic but at the same time it ’s not been too bad considering it ’s been after a @entity14 tour , it ’s such a long season and i ’ve moved to a new place			1
i ’ve got to give myself a bit of leeway			2
’ @entity2 may self - analyse with a harsh eye but he is a fundamentally positive character so critical reflection soon gives way to satisfaction about his move from @entity66 to the @entity67			1
last week , @entity9 won the @entity68 and now they are one win away from the league title , so their high - profile signing has enjoyed being part of a team success even sooner than he had dared to imagine			1
the environment he has found himself in is similar to the one he left behind in @entity8			1
‘ @entity75 is king here , ’ he said			2
it ’s quite like @entity8 because everyone gets involved but it ’s a bigger goldfish bowl			1
it ’s more of a pond ! everyone has been super-kind			2
walking round the supermarket , i ’ll be choosing my bananas and people will come up and say “ good luck on saturday , we ’ll be there ”			2
’ food and drink references occur frequently as @entity2 considers his existence in @entity93 rugby			1
asked if he has now come to terms with public attention at such a young age , he added : ‘ it ’s chips and rice — half and half			0
i ’m more aware of it now since coming back from the @entity14 tour			1
silverware : @entity2 ( holding trophy ) celebrates wining the @entity104 with @entity9 ‘ it ’s part of the job but i sometimes find it difficult dealing with that — the other half of rugby			1
i still find it strange when people want to hear my opinion because i just think i talk rubbish most of the time — i have n’t got too much wisdom ! ’ he came into the @entity30 with a notion of what the game would be like			1
as a @entity120 with an outsider ’s perspective of @entity93 rugby , @entity2 expected an endless routine of arm - wrestle contests and limited openings out wide			1
since then he has changed his mind — to an extent			0
‘ i would say it is 75 per cent the same as i thought it would be , ’ he said			0
‘ it is very physical			0
they love to maul it			0
they love a forwards game			0
but i ’m quite lucky that at @entity9 we do play quite an open game			1
other clubs like @entity140 , @entity28 , @entity141 also play some beautiful rugby			1
‘ it is not just stick - it - up - the - jumper rugby all the time so my perception was wrong in a way			2
you ’ve got what i call the boring bits — scrums , lineouts and mauling			0
you need that sometimes , especially if you have a dominant pack			0
but you also need the va - va - voom ! ’ entert the dragon : @entity9 takes rugby as seriously as in his homeland wales , says @entity2 that ’s where @entity159 comes in			1
he has provided vivid flashes of that game - breaking quality , such as when he carved @entity164 open at @entity165 early in the campaign , to set up the try of the season for @entity169			2
he has savoured a handful of games when he has gone through his full repertoire but also the major team landmarks such as beating @entity174 in the semi-final at a fervent @entity176			0
‘ that whole experience will stay with me forever , ’ he said			0
’ along the way , there have been times when the cape has slipped off his weary shoulders — when the @entity41 of weekly demand has dragged him down			0
‘ now and again i ’ve thought , “ i could do with a week off ” , ’ he said			0
‘ this season has been really hard but i ’ve really enjoyed it , too			2
‘ i am looking forward to some time off			0
i love my job but it is good to get away from it occasionally			0
i worked out the other day that by the time this season is over i ’ll have been going for two years and a couple of months without a substantial break , so this summer will be great			2
‘ people keep asking me if i ’m going away but i ’m not			0
the only thing i ’ve booked is to go to @entity196 to see @entity197 ( girlfriend cyclist @entity198 ) racing in the @entity199			0
apart from that it will just be nice to go home , sit down and have a cup of tea with my mum , go for a ride on my bike and play a bit of golf			0
i need the break , mentally more than anything			0
’ long season : @entity2 admits there are times when he has wanted to take a week off before that welcome respite @entity159 has three more monumental occasions ahead of him			1
he expects a titanic tussle with @entity28 and does n’t dare hope that their @entity217 final defeat against @entity218 last week will have broken their spirit			1
‘ @entity28 will be wounded but they will dust themselves off and go again , ’ he said			2
‘ they have been the dominant team in the @entity30 this season and they ’ve got a great chance to win silverware this weekend , but so do we			1
’ when the domestic duties are over he will join @entity8 for two tests in @entity36			1
it looms as a gruelling assignment for a side missing the likes of captain @entity231 and @entity232 , but @entity159 believes the tourists have enough quality in their ranks to mount a compelling challenge			0
‘ there was talk they were going to rest some boys but you ca n’t go to @entity36 with semi-skimmed milk , ’ he said , in metaphor mode again			2
‘ we have to throw everything at them			0
people wo n’t expect much of us but no - one expected much of us going to the last @entity248 and we came out strong			0
we ’ve still got a hell of a squad			0
we ’re taking as much firepower as possible			0

@entity18 @entity2 admits feeling the *weight* of expectation
