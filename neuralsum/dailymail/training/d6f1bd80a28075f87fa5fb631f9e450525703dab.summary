graduate @entity0 , 36 , says she was told to take her degree off her cv as it might help her get a job after years of hard work , @entity0 was proud to put her degree on her cv			1
so she was understandably devastated when , she claims , a job centre adviser told her to take it off – because it made her ‘ overqualified ’ for some roles			1
miss @entity0 , 36 , graduated from the @entity9 in july last year , and has since been unable to find a job despite applying for more than 200 positions			1
she says she was reduced to tears after one of the government ’s welfare - to - work advisers ‘ bullied ’ her into changing her cv , claiming she needed to make it more basic			2
the adviser , who she sees as a condition of claiming @entity21 , ‘ threatened to sanction ’ her if she did not remove her 2:2 @entity17 in social and community care work within three days			1
miss @entity0 claims the employment adviser , who she describes as in his mid- 50s , told her that he used to be an employer and he would not have taken her on because she was too qualified			1
‘ they ’ve told me i have to dumb down my cv but i ’ve studied hard for this , ’ she said			2
‘ i ’d take any job to be able to stop signing on			0
he bullied me into changing something i was really proud of and threatened that my benefits could be taken away if i did not do as he told me			0
’ she added : ‘ by removing my degree , i would leave a five - year gap on my cv [ she studied part of her degree part - time ] , which i thought would cause me more problems			1
’ the former care assistant , from @entity40 , would like to find a job in support work , for example as a probation officer or social worker			2
but she has also been applying for jobs at supermarkets and high street shops			0
miss @entity0 , pictured job - hunting at home in @entity40 , has applied for more than 200 posts since she graduated the graduate was advised about her cv in her local job centre , thought to be this one in @entity40 's @entity55 she also volunteers at a fair trade shop to gain retail experience and helps out at @entity58 , a charity that gives women counselling and support			1

her long - term partner , 39 - year - old @entity66 , later telephoned the @entity68 job centre			1
mr @entity66 , who works in the building trade , said the manager insisted it was not the centre ’s policy to advise job - seekers to remove qualifications			2
but @entity68 said that the career aspirations of its customers are not always ‘ realistic ’ in the current labour market			0
in a statement , it said : ‘ if customers are struggling to gain employment in their chosen field , we would help them look at other realistic opportunities			0
' this can mean re-looking at the make - up of a cv and the labour market it ’s aimed at			0
’ it insisted , however , that this would only be a suggestion , adding : ‘ qualifications and degrees are achievements to be very proud of and we would never request their removal from a cv but would recommend that a cv is focused clearly towards the vacancy or industry sector that a candidate is applying for			0
’ @entity99 ’s @entity98 , mp for @entity100 , said : ‘ it is very worrying that unemployed graduates in @entity40 are being advised to remove qualifications in an attempt to secure any type of employment			0
