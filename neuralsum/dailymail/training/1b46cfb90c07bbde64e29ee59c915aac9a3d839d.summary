@entity0 questioned @entity2 ’s ambition as he reacted to @entity4 ’s revelations that he is about to be sacked			1
@entity0 is set to go after the club ’s final @entity6 clash against @entity8 , but he hit back by querying whether @entity2 were still the club to match his ambition as a manager			1
the 59 - year - old said : ‘ i have more ambition than @entity2 ever have			1
i have more ambition than them , or the same ambition as them			2
i want to get into the new stadium			2
i want to win a cup			1
if i do n’t have ambition i do n’t do this job			2
‘ if i do n’t have drive , or motivation , i do n’t do this job			0
i have seen it all before and you use your experience to try to achieve that ambition			0
can @entity2 match my ambition ? eventually , yes			2
it is whether everyone is patient enough to wait to get there			0
that is the problem today : a lack of patience across the board			0
’ @entity0 said he had spoken to joint owner @entity44 on thursday about arranging a meeting to discuss next season ’s plans and was given ‘ no indication his position was under threat ’			1
he defended his record in keeping the club in the top flight for a second consecutive season and said @entity2 played ‘ terrific football ’			1
but , when asked whether he was still the man to lead the @entity2 into their new home at the @entity58 , @entity0 admitted the realistic answer was ‘ no ’			1
@entity60 in hands : @entity0 is on the verge of being sacked by @entity2 at the end of the season he said : ‘ as the average life of a manager is 13 months you would have to say “ no ” , being realistic			1
‘ we ’ve had more ( managerial ) changes in the @entity6 than ever before and one never knows when it ’s going to happen to you			2
you have to do the best with the resources you ’ve got			0
this club was in the championship when i came here and i have delivered what i have been asked to deliver			0
i did what @entity79 did at @entity81 , but six or seven weeks ago			0
so if i had done it now instead of then would everyone be singing my praises ? probably yes			0
’ @entity2 can finish no higher than 12th , but @entity0 pledged his team would ‘ try to spoil @entity8 ’s party ’ by pulling off an unlikely win at the @entity87 that could deny @entity89 ’s side the @entity6 title			1
head over heels : @entity2 are 12th in the @entity6 and set to finish in mid-table @entity2 have suffered a 12 - 1 aggregate scoreline against @entity8 in three league and @entity96 matches this season , but @entity0 insisted a fully fit @entity2 team are still capable of causing an upset			1
he added it is striker @entity102 ’s last chance to impress @entity104 boss @entity103 , who names his @entity107 squad on monday			0
@entity0 said : ‘ every player can go and give his best because we know we ’re safe in the @entity6 , so let ’s go and spoil @entity8 ’s party			1
‘ @entity102 is full of energy			0
he has not had a long arduous season like some players have had			2
he is ready to go			0
a big performance against @entity8 could maybe tip @entity103 ’s mind — who knows ? ’			0
