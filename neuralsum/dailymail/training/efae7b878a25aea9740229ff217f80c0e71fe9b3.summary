here , @entity9 's @entity0 rates the two teams and gives his verdict on which @entity2 players deserve to start next week 's second test in @entity14			1
@entity2 @entity15 - 7not his stellar best , often double tackled , but strong and feisty			1
verdict : must start in @entity14 strength : @entity15 was n't at his best , but was a constant source of power for @entity2 @entity21 - 7 tidy all - round game but rightly yellow carded late in second half			1
verdict : did enough to stay in @entity25 - 8 looks fit , fresh and hungry			1
big threat to @entity3 defence			1

verdict : @entity35 if fit too strong : @entity25 ( centre ) is stopped by the @entity3 defence during the test match @entity39 - 6 @entity41 ’s egg			1
some good moments , must adapt to @entity43			2
verdict : move @entity25 to the wing @entity45 - 7 composed , kicked his goals and justified @entity48 ’s confidence			1
verdict : @entity49 to start if fit in the mix : both @entity31 and @entity45 were in impressive form at @entity8 @entity52 - 6 busy against top opponent			2
second fumble nearly cost @entity2 dear			1
verdict : @entity56 returns if fit substitutes - 7 not a massive factor but @entity59 got on the front foot and kicked his penalty with aplomb			2
@entity63 - 7 solid evening ’s work and that short fuse seemed well under control			2
verdict : good to go again battle : @entity63 ( centre ) is tackled by @entity70 ( left ) and @entity71 during @entity2 's defeat @entity73 - 7 a standout effort			1
good in the tight and line - out , extra option in loose			0

verdict : @entity94 to come back @entity95 - 7 finished strongly for @entity96 and maintained that form here			0
verdict : @entity99 is first choice @entity101 ( capt ) - 8 one of his best performances - and against @entity71 as well			1
verdict : will lead from front again @entity105 - 7 very fine effort , carried very well and gave @entity2 go - forward			1
verdict : ... but @entity109 returns leader : @entity2 skipper @entity101 ( centre ) put in one of his best performances @entity3 @entity114 - 6 one slashing run in attack but unusually error - prone for such a quality player			1
@entity118 - 7 made up for earlier handling errors with that brilliant try - scoring pass at the death			0
@entity5 - 8 the old head knew exactly what was required in the 79th minute to score his try			0
experienced : @entity5 scored the crucial 79th minute try for @entity3 @entity126 - 6 not at his best by any means			1
should have been yellow - carded for shirt - tugging early on			0
@entity130 - 6 quiet night , few chances to shine , which is a testament to @entity2 ’s pressure game			1
@entity133 - 7 not without error but a very accomplished stand - in for the resting @entity136			0
@entity137 - 8 livewire , clever kicker , speedy delivery			0
@entity3 ’s best player on the night			2
@entity141 man : @entity137 of the @entity3 was one of the best players on the pitch at @entity8 @entity144 - 6 veteran @entity146 - winning prop but @entity2 had the better of the front - row exchanges			1
@entity149 - 6 has bulked up but still struggling at scrum time			0
@entity3 scrum improved when he departed			2
@entity153 - 6 had his hands full in the tight and not seen in the loose as much as usual			0
missing : @entity149 ( centre ) struggled to impose himself when it came to scrum time @entity158 - 7 made that long second - half break and considerable line - out force			0
@entity162 - 7 unsung workhorse as ever but tough going against an aggressive @entity2 pack			2
stopped : @entity2 managed @entity71 well and kept the @entity3 captain relatively quiet @entity70 - 6 came second - best to @entity2 at the tackle area			1
could drop out if @entity168 returns			0
@entity71 ( capt ) - 7 quiet by his immense standards			0
@entity2 power at breakdown helped negate him			2
@entity174 - 7 not a natural no 8			0
