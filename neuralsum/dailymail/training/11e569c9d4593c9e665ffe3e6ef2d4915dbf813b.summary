these rare photographs show the hard labour of @entity3 miners digging for tin deep below the earth in extremely dangerous conditions			1
the images , taken in the darkness of four separate mines in @entity10 , were captured with the help of very early flash technology , which allowed photographer @entity13 to bring the underground world to life			1
published in 1893 , mr @entity13 's photographs show the miners clambering through the warren of tunnels , held up by precarious wooden beams , as they dug out tin and copper and to fuel industrial @entity23			1
toil : a bare - chested miner can be seen pushed a cart through @entity28 's @entity27 in @entity10 , as fellow miners operate the machinery illuminated : photographer @entity13 used rudimentary flash technology to light up the underground scenes precarious : miners climb rickety ladders in the image to the left , while , right , a man prepared to load a mine cart with ore the workers toiled in very harsh conditions - often for little pay - all the while breathing in filthy air under the ground			1
accidents were common - indeed at @entity47 , one of the mines pictured , seven men were crushed after timber supports gave way around the same time the photographs were published			1
some frames show the miners hard at work , drilling bore holes into the rock and setting up heavy machinery - while another shows them at rest , eating traditional @entity10 pasties			2
mr @entity13 was commissioned to take the photographs by local mine owners , who wanted to showcase the technology used in their underground enterprise			1
the illustrated guide which he produced - ' @entity67 and @entity33 : underground scenes by @entity69 - was later used as a teaching aid			2
at least four separate mines were featured in his book - @entity47 , a copper and tin mine in @entity75 ; @entity76 in @entity77 ; @entity79 tin mine in @entity80 , and @entity28 's @entity81 in @entity76			1
hard at it : in this frame the miners can be seen boring into the rock			0
the tin and copper from @entity10 mines sold for millions across the nation cramped : mines would often have to scrambled between the beams in claustrophobic conditions at ease : in this more relaxed picture the miners are seen at rest , as many of them eat @entity10 pasties digging for victory : here workers in @entity99 start work on a bore hole headed towards the surface in order to illuminate his photographs mr @entity13 rigged up a system of lamps filled with highly flammable magnesium powder			1
he then instructed teams of miners to light the powder , creating a bright flash which allowed him to capture the scene			2
the process was difficult , time - consuming and often did n't work - of the 100 images only 24 were deemed printable , and mr @entity13 wrote of how a whole day 's work would often turn out to be useless			1
in a text describing his efforts , he wrote : ' it is a rather disheartening experience to find the results of a whole days work with an energetic band of helpers are not " printable " , but such experience was mine on more than one occasion			0
' the work , however is so full of interest , and its performance so productive of welcome enlightenment on many critical points , that i have no intention of allowing it to remain where it is			0
i hope that at no distant date , the present attempt may be followed by another and more successful one			0
' technology : @entity138 was commissioned to take the series of photographs to showcase the mines ' advances widespread : at its peak , the mining industry employed as many as 25 per cent of @entity10 's working men heritage : mr @entity13 was commissioned to photograph the mines by their owners , and compiled the results in ' @entity67 and @entity33 : underground scenes by @entity69 , right locations : @entity151 took his photographs in several mines , including @entity76 , left , and @entity79 , right			1
they are pictured above as they are today a copy of the book is for sale in an upcoming auction , and is expected to fetch £ 2,250			1
it goes under the hammer at this year 's @entity162 , on may 23 and 24			0
bookseller @entity163 said : ' mr @entity13 was attempting to showcase the mining technology of his age , but in doing so he devised some pretty groundbreaking methods of his own			1
' using explosive materials in the open air would be challenging enough back in 1893 , but to do it in the pitch dark confines of an underground mine shaft seems unthinkable			2
' evidently our late @entity3 counterparts did not share our modern day obsession with health and safety			0
' @entity10 's rich veins of tin and copper have made it a centre of the mining industry since pre-historic times			0
@entity10 mining interests are suggested as one reason for the @entity188 , and medieval documents attest to the productivity of the early mines			2
but it was with the advent of the industrial revolution when mining in @entity10 really came into its own , prompted by demand for the valuable metals in industrial production			0
at its peak , mining in @entity10 employed as many as 25 per cent of the county 's working men			0
plans : @entity203 was @entity205 's last functioning tin mine , but closed in 1998			0
it has been suggested that rising prices could lead to the mine re-opening , but this is yet to happen although the conditions underground were unforgiving , the work paid better than the alternatives of fishing or farming			2
billions of pounds worth of metal was dragged up from the earth during the industry 's late 1800s peak , though the @entity10 industry experienced periodic slumps as prices rose and fell due to competition and new technology			0
by the latter half of the 19th century many mines in the area had been forced to close thanks to intense competition from mines elsewhere in the world			0
according to @entity231 , as many as half a million miners left @entity10 between 1815 and 1915 , often setting up their own mines in other countries such as @entity234 , @entity235 and the the @entity236 the industry continued in @entity10 - albeit at a much lower capacity - until the late 1990s			1
south crofty mine - the last working tin mine in @entity205 - remained open until 1998			0
plans have been suggested to re-open the mine in light of increased global tin prices , but have yet to materialise .			0

photographs taken by @entity13 use early flash techniques to capture life underground
mr @entity13 was commissioned by mine owners to capture the once - *thriving* industry
but the frank photographs show the precarious *constructions* of the mines - which were prone to collapse
the *collection* of photographs will go on sale at auction this *weekend* and could fetch £ 2,000
