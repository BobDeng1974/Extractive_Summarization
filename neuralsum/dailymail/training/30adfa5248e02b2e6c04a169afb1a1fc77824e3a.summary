the wind turbine built with £ 48,000 of taxpayers ' money has been producing so little electricity it will take more than 400 years to repay the bill a wind turbine built with £ 48,000 of taxpayers ’ money has been producing so little electricity it will take more than 400 years to repay the bill , it emerged yesterday			1
despite being in a windy , coastal town , the 60ft structure was built in a sheltered valley and managed to generate only an average of £ 5 worth of electricity a month			1
now critics have branded the scheme ‘ an obscenely expensive vanity project ’			0
the turbine was erected at the @entity21 offices of the @entity24 - controlled @entity23 government in 2009 with the aim of reducing its carbon footprint			1
but after years of scepticism – and in response to a freedom of information application – the assembly finally admitted yesterday that the turbine had generated just @entity32 of electricity a month			1
officials blamed mechanical problems , which meant the turbine had been able to work at only quarter capacity until the start of this year			2
it is now operating at 68 per cent of capacity , but the electricity it generates still works out at less than £ 9 a month			2
at that rate it will take around 450 years for the cost of buying and installing the turbine to be recouped			1
the company which supplied it , @entity45 , denied mechanical problems were to blame and said it had warned the @entity23 government in advance that the site was too sheltered			2
experts agreed that in a more - exposed spot in a coastal town buffeted by weather from @entity56 , a turbine ought to be capable of generating 20 times as much power			1
‘ the problem is quite simple – it ’s been put in the wrong place , ’ turbine installer @entity58 said			2
turbines need unobstructed access to wind from all directions			0
‘ unfortunately the @entity23 government ’s one is located in a valley two miles from the sea and has quite a short tower			0
‘ it ’s next to tall buildings – so even if there ’s a strong wind it will be displaced by the time it reaches the turbine			1
’ @entity78 , political director of the @entity79 , said : ‘ it would seem that the turbine ’s installation was nothing more than an obscenely expensive vanity project			0
’ and he pointed out : ‘ if this project had been started when @entity87 was on the throne , it would only be reaching break - even point now , 60 years into the reign of @entity91 waste of money : this taxpayer - funded 60ft wind turbine has been producing just £ 5 of electricity a month - because it was put up in an area of @entity21 where there is very little wind last night the @entity23 government said the turbine was part of its ‘ ambitious ’ green programme which also featured a biomass heating system and solar panels at its @entity21 offices			1
‘ as a result , we have seen a 17 per cent reduction in @entity110 emissions over the past two years and are well on course to meet the overarching target of a 30 per cent reduction by 2020			0
’ n a couple has won a legal ruling that ten wind turbines be removed because they spoil the view from their home in @entity119			0
in a judgment with widespread implications for the rest of the @entity123 , a court in @entity124 agreed the 360ft - high structures ruined @entity126 and @entity128 ’s quality of life			0
the @entity129 , part of energy giant @entity131 , was fined £ 31,500 and told to remove the turbines within four months or face daily penalties of £ 450 .			0

60ft turbine built in area where there is no wind in @entity21
taxpayer - funded turbine built in a sheltered valley , away from windy coast
turbine produces so little electricity it will take 400 years to repay the bill
