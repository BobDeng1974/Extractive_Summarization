by @entity0 another difficult foreign assignment			2
another remarkable performance and result from @entity5 ’s indefatigable @entity4			1
the @entity7 holders did n’t quite match their victories in @entity9 and @entity10 of a year ago but this was still an outcome to be treasured for all concerned			2
looking every inch seasoned @entity17 campaigners , the men from @entity14 sucked up just about everything a lively @entity20 side could throw at them before daring to grab the away goal that gives them reason to believe in a week ’s time			1
get in : @entity25 ( centre ) watches as his effort beats the @entity20 defence and keeper @entity30 : @entity25 celebrates the vital away goal as @entity4 put in a superb display in @entity20 response : @entity35 's scrappy goal meant that @entity36 could only return level for the second leg @entity25 , the scorer against @entity39 a year ago and the man who finished the job in the @entity42 against @entity43 , added another memorable strike to his growing collection with a goal shortly after the interval that temporarily winded the @entity48			1
truthfully , it would have been harsh on the home side had they lost on the night but the scrappy manner of @entity35 ’s equaliser will rankle with the @entity54 as they make their way home this morning			1
but it ’s unquestionably advantage @entity4 now			1
and , provided they display the same nous and discipline they oozed here , there is no reason to believe a third successive @entity17 adventure will end here			2
the 17,000 capacity @entity65 — a larger , sun - kissed version of @entity69 — made for a scenic setting for @entity36 ’ first competitive outing since their @entity7 triumph			2
important : @entity35 celebrates his leveller , which was probably no less than the home side deserved @entity20 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity75 ; @entity77 , @entity78 , ( @entity79 60 ) @entity76 , @entity80 ( @entity81 67 ) ; @entity82 , @entity35 ; @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , ( @entity86 60 ) ; @entity87			1
subs not used : @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 : @entity93 ( 4 - 5 - 1 ) : @entity94 ; @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity5 , @entity97 ; @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 , ( @entity101 67 ) @entity102 , @entity103 ( @entity104 89 ) ; @entity25			1
subs not used : @entity106 , may , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 : @entity5 , @entity98 , @entity110 : @entity111 ( @entity112 )			0
mercifully for the @entity54 , the oppressive heat of the afternoon had relented somewhat come kick - off and the sight of the surface largely enveloped in shade was welcome			0
@entity20 might not be as big a name as the @entity36 defeated a year ago , but a fourth - place finish in their league last season underscored the scale of the task			1
@entity5 opted not to risk talismanic striker @entity124 on account of a thigh injury meaning @entity25 was handed the sole striker role ahead of a compact five - man midfield			1
the @entity36 boss had identified the diminutive @entity80 as the man his side had to watch and the winger soon showed why — forcing an early stop from goalkeeper @entity94 after floating away from @entity95 then having a low strike blocked by the defender ’s outstretched leg			0
that aside , the @entity14 men looked comparatively comfortable in the early exchanges			0
backing : plenty of @entity4 fans made the trip to @entity48 to see their team get a good draw battling hard : @entity4 were disciplined throughout and played like @entity17 veterans @entity5 was frustrated that his side did n’t make their height superiority count at two dangerous set plays and gradually the @entity48 awoke from their slumbers			1
@entity4 passed up several opportunities to clear their lines and were relieved to see @entity87 flash a shot over the top after an almighty goalmouth scramble			1
@entity84 then eliminated @entity36 ’ defender @entity153 with a beautifully - crafted diagonal and only @entity94 ’ fingertips prevented @entity80 ’s volley rocketing into the net			0
as the home side cranked up the pressure , @entity35 fizzed a 20 - yarder off the crossbar with @entity94 this time looking every inch a beaten man			1
saints briefly bought themselves some respite with a cleverly worked free - kick			0
@entity98 looked to have overcooked his cross to the far post but @entity96 had timed his run to perfection			0
clearly taken by surprise , keeper @entity75 threw out his right hand to prevent the skipper ’s hooked volley beating him at his near post			0
up for the fight : @entity98 battles with @entity20 's @entity80 in the @entity65 the sound of the half - time whistle was still music to the ears of the @entity7 holders			1
another gem of a cross by @entity80 picked out @entity87 and only @entity97 ’ s intelligent positioning on the line maintained parity			0
saints were well disciplined , although @entity186 could have no gripe when he picked up the only booking of the first half after taking out @entity84 following a clumsy touch on the halfway line			0
the travelling party would have spent the interval praying for the same blank score come time up , so they were in clover when @entity25 edged them in front three minutes after the break			2
it stemmed from @entity98 ’s deep in - swinging corner which caught @entity20 defender @entity83 off guard			2
@entity25 ’s initial attempt to guide the ball home was blocked by the defender but he kept his cool , and arrowed the ball into the far corner of the net			2
the blue section of the stadium exploded with joy			0
it might even have better before the hour - mark			0
@entity96 ’s header looked in all the way until @entity83 swept it to safety from under his bar			0
something to defend : @entity103 holds off a @entity20 player - @entity4 will have to do the same next week all @entity5 on the night : @entity36 boss @entity5 applauds the travelling fans on a good night for his side with the game stretched , the base of the post denied @entity225 ’s header after the defender had bounded forward to connect with @entity84 ’s centre			1
@entity98 and @entity97 ’s bookings were indicative of @entity36 ’ increasing anxiety and on 68 minutes they could hold back the tide no more			0
an untidy sequence of play ended with @entity35 being fed with his back to goal on the penalty spot			1
with @entity96 for company , he bobbed and weaved to create half - a - yard and produced an incisive finish on the turn to square the game			0
substitute @entity86 rippled the side - netting with the aid of a @entity5 deflection then made a rickets of an @entity81 cross with the goal at his mercy			2
but the @entity54 were not to be denied a result that promises so much for the return in @entity14 .			0

@entity25 gives @entity4 the lead
@entity35 equalises for @entity20
@entity4 's away goal puts them in strong position
