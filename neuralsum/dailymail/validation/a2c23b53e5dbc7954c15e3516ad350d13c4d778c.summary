the @entity2 four - hour waiting target will be missed for the whole of 2014/15 , the @entity0 today said			1
repeated failure to achieve the target of 95 per cent of patients waiting four hours or less at @entity2 departments in @entity8 means it is no longer possible for the @entity10 to meet the standard for the year			1
the latest figures , for the week ending march 8 , show the gold standard was missed for the 23rd week running			1
it comes as a report warns even top performing hospitals are showing signs of buckling under the immense pressures faced by the @entity10			1
' warning signs are flashing ' across hospitals with experts advising the government there is ' no quick fix ' to the troubles plaguing the health service			1
the @entity0 today said the four - hour @entity2 waiting time will be missed for the whole of 2014/15 after the latest weekly figures showed the target was not achieved for the 23rd consecutive week today @entity8 revealed 92 per cent of patients spent four hours or less from arrival to being sent home or admitted elsewhere in the hospital			1
it marks a four - week high , but still falls short of the 95 per cent target			2
it came in spite of higher numbers of patients attending emergency departments , with 434,800 patients visiting @entity2 - up by more than 8,000 from the previous week and a four - week high			1
a round - up of the winter 's figures show unprecedented demand on @entity2 , with two weeks in december having the two highest attendance figures ever recorded for a winter period			2
emergency departments across @entity8 dealt with more than seven million attendances from november to february - an increase of 190,000 on the same period last winter			0
and demand in november and december was particularly high , with attendances up by 6.2 per cent over the two months			0
the highest peak was seen before @entity52 in the week ending december 21 , when there were 446,000 attendances - up 9.3 per cent on the same week last winter			2
a @entity0 spokeswoman said : ' we know the @entity10 is busier than ever before and despite missing the @entity2 standard for the year , over nine out of ten patients are being seen , treated and discharged within four hours			1
' we 've given a record £ 700 million this winter for almost 800 more doctors , 4,700 more nurses and 6,400 more beds and are backing the @entity10 long term plan which focuses on joining up care and doing more to prevent illness , and have provided an extra £ 2 billion in funding next year to build a service fit for the future			0
' meanwhile a new report by the @entity69 suggests the problems facing the @entity10 go far deeper into hospitals than just the front door at @entity2			1
they warn a ' deteriorating access to services is starting to affect patients attending even the best - performing hospitals '			0
meanwhile those at the bottom end of the performance pile have seen a ' marked deterioration '			0
the think tank has warned that not only are patients waiting longer to be seen in @entity2 , access to key services across the hospital is being affected by ' systemic ' declines in performance			2
patients arriving at @entity2 have often had to wait longer than the four - hour target , according to the @entity69 's analysis of how all 156 hospitals trusts in @entity8 have performed against six national targets over the course of the @entity96 government			1
it comes as a report warns even top performing hospitals are showing signs of buckling under the immense pressures faced by the @entity10			1
it found the problems facing the @entity10 go far deeper into hospitals than just the front door at @entity2 , affecting access to planned treatments but the report highlights the problems with today 's nhs go further than @entity2			2
it found the majority of hospitals breached a target on at least one of the six measures - most notably the @entity2 waiting time , the 18 - week target for a hospital bed , and the six - week target for scans and other diagnostic tests			1
co-author @entity119 , said : ' the vast majority of patients are still receiving care within the target times , but our analysis shows that deteriorating access to services is starting to affect patients attending even the best - performing hospitals			1
' we 've known that hospitals have been struggling to meet the four - hour @entity2 target for a while			1
' but the fact that we are starting to see problems in other areas , like access to planned treatment , is a real concern			0
95 per cent – the national target specifying the proportion of patients that should spend four hours or less in @entity2 before being sent home or admitted elsewhere in the hospital			1
92 per cent – average performance against the four - hour target by major @entity2 departments in 2014			1
three hours 43 minutes – the average time spent in @entity2 by a patient who is admitted to hospital after leaving @entity2			2
two hours 17 minutes – the average time spent in @entity2 by a patient who is sent home after leaving @entity2			2
more than one hour , four minutes – how much longer on average a patient over the age of 75 spends in @entity2 compared with those aged under 75			0
' as this study makes clear , warning lights are now starting to flash across the wider hospital system			0
' the @entity69 's analysis also questions the assumption that access to care deteriorates as hospitals are asked to treat more patients			2
while extra activity in @entity2 , outpatient treatments and cancer care is matched with poorer performance against access targets , the @entity10 has absorbed an additional 240,000 diagnostic tests and an additional 45,000 urgent cancer referrals in the past year with little impact on performance against the associated targets			2
criteria monitored by the trust also included the 18 - week target for an outpatient appointment , the two - week target for urgent cancer referral , and the 31 - day target for cancer treatment			0
co-author @entity182 warned there is no ' quick fix ' to the problems			0
he said : ' while looking at a narrow set of targets can only tell us so much about the quality of care , this analysis does suggest that some of the recent reductions in performance are systemic			0
' the response to declining performance must be dictated by a deeper understanding of its causes , and political leaders should be aware of their system - wide nature			0
' there are no quick fixes for growing waiting times and we need to be prepared to see further breaches of targets in the future			0
' the report states that longer waiting times could simply be the result of hospitals having to carry out more procedures			0
@entity69 analysis shows that increases in hospital activity are not always associated with a decrease in waiting time performance			2
the report adds : ' failure to meet , for example , the four - hour @entity2 target appears to have very little bearing on performance against other measures			1
' this again suggests that these problems may be systemic and that applying extra pressure at hospital level is not the best approach to reversing the recent performance drop			0
' a @entity0 spokeswoman said : ' we know the @entity10 is busier than ever and despite missing the @entity2 target for the year , over nine out of 10 patients are being seen , treated and discharged within four hours			1
a @entity0 spokesman said : ' the @entity10 is busier than ever , as innovative treatments and medicines mean people are living longer with complex conditions like heart disease or diabetes			0
' we 've increased the @entity10 budget by £ 16 billion over this @entity242 but ultimately we want to reduce pressure on services through our plans to increase access to primary care and look after people better in the community			0
' responding to the latest @entity2 figures , @entity250 , director of operations and delivery for @entity8 , said : ' this winter @entity10 staff in @entity8 pulled out all the stops and , compared with last year , provided care for an incredible 190,000 more people coming to @entity2 and 51,000 more being admitted to hospital as an emergency			1
' these record numbers - up by between six and nine per cent some weeks - mean that although the @entity10 wo n't have met the @entity2 average 95 per cent target for the full year , staff continued even during this busiest winter ever to treat more than nine in ten people within four hours			1
' and most patients were , in fact , treated in under an hour			0
this is not only the best performance in the @entity268 but probably of any major country internationally			0
' these winter pressures underline the importance of the wider work under way as part of the @entity275 and @entity276 which will deliver care in a more integrated way , better helping people get the right treatment , at the right time and in the right place			0

repeated failure to meet four - hour target means it can not be achieved for the year 2014/15 , the @entity0 said today
aim is for 95 **%** of patients to wait four hours or less from arrival at @entity2 to being sent home or to another ward in the hospital for care
latest weekly figures shows standard missed for 23rd consecutive week
week ending march 8 saw 92 **%** of patients seen within the target time
comes as report warns even top hospitals are struggling amid pressures
