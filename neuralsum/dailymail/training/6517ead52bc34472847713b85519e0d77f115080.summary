by @entity0 published : 00:41 est , 2 march 2013 updated : 04:21 est , 2 march 2013 it was revealed today that the doctor who stabbed her seven - year - old daughter 31 times before killing herself had a major confrontation with her relatives in the weeks preceding her suicide			1
@entity8 , 45 , told a friend that her relatives were ' all dead to me now ' after a massive falling out			1
@entity8 was discovered lying dead in the master bedroom of her @entity12 , @entity13 home when the father of her daughter came to pick the girl up			1
the daughter , @entity17 , was found lying nearby but in spite of her significant injuries , she was ' alert and responsive ' when emergency crews arrived on scene			1
tragic : dr @entity8 ( left ) is thought to have stabbed her 7 - year - old daughter @entity22 ( right ) 31 times before killing herself in their home a number of details surrounding the life of dr @entity28 are mysteriously missing as investigators try to explain how she could have brought herself to harm her daughter and then kill herself			1
it is unclear whether dr @entity8 and her daughter 's father , dr @entity32 had ever married , but they were not together at the time of her death			1
dr @entity17 was the one to call police on thursday as he arrived at the home to pick up the girl			2
dr @entity17 , 68 , did not live with @entity8 and their daughter , but co-owned the home			1
though she remains in critical condition , he seemed hopeful on thursday night , telling @entity46 : ' be happy that she 's going to be fine			2
thank @entity47 she 's alive			2
she 's going to be ok			0
' dr @entity17 was brought in for questioning by @entity49 police , but was later released			0
they do not believe he played any role in the tragedy , the @entity50 reported			0
police now think that the best understanding of the true version of events will come from the little girl as soon as she is strong enough to talk to investigators			0
discovery : they were found by the girl 's father , who co-owned the house with @entity8 police said @entity8 left behind no note explaining why she attacked her daughter or took her own life			1
she used a knife or other sharp object to kill herself , officers said			0
if she tried to kill @entity22 and herself , it was a misguided — probably frantic — attempt to spare them both future suffering , ' her college friend @entity72 told local paper @entity50			0
ms @entity72 spoke to dr @entity8 two weeks before her death and said that her friend was going through some family trouble , though she did not know the cause			1
' she would call me crying and say , " family is the most important thing to me , and i do n’t feel like i have a family anymore			0
" these are her exact words — ‘ my heart bleeds for this little girl ( @entity22 ) because she does n’t have a family , ' she told the paper			0
@entity8 went on to dramatically liken the split in her family to genocide			2
tragic : @entity8 's body is carried away by coroners but her daughter survived and is in critical condition investigation : she left no note explaining why she attacked her daughter or took her life , police said that was not the only split going on in her life either , as she recently closed one of her three medical practices			1
@entity8 was a podiatrist with practices in @entity107 and @entity108 , @entity109 , but the doctor who sold her the @entity107 practice spoke to her about six months ago and was told that she was shuttering the location			2
' i asked her if there was anything i could do to help			0
she said no , that she was fine			0
she wanted to join a group practice , ' dr @entity116 told @entity46			0
she co-owned the house in @entity12 where she lived with her daughter and bought it with the girl 's father in 2010 for $ 810,000			1
the lawyer who represented them in the sale said that he thought that they were together as a couple , but @entity17 's grown son from a different relationship refutes that theory			0
' it ’s a touchy situation because he had a child with her ( @entity8 ) but was n't married to her , ' @entity130 , 29 , told @entity50			2
scene : her body was found next to her daughter at their home in @entity12 , @entity109 on thursday ' the child was very important to him , so he always tried to maintain a healthy relationship			1
' the elder mr @entity32 had reportedly been married to a different woman for several decades , though the status of that relationship is also unclear			0
though dr @entity17 and dr @entity8 apparently tried to be civil for the health of their daughter , her friend ms @entity72 painted a picture of a turbulent relationship			1
' a lot of times , when i would speak with her , they were in a fight and he was nowhere to be found			2
at times , he just would n’t take her calls or respond to her , and that would make her extremely anxious and desperate , ' she said .			0
