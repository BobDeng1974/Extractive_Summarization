vulnerable : @entity1 with his seven - year - old daughter , @entity2 , who admires one direction visitors to our house can be left in no doubt as to which pop stars my daughter @entity2 admires			1
drinks are taken from a @entity13 cup , their fresh - faces beaming out at us at breakfast , lunch and dinner			2
the band ’s latest album , @entity20 , is on permanent loop , their movie @entity23 is watched every single weekend , while posters of @entity25 , 20 , @entity26 , 21 , and 22 - year - old @entity27 gaze down from her bedroom wall			1
louis is her favourite , she tells me on a daily basis			0
she believes he can do no wrong			0
last week , when my wife calmly suggested the @entity37 was a better singer than @entity30 , @entity39 broke out			1
tears were shed and in the fallout , i found myself under attack for claiming , months earlier , that @entity43 were more successful than @entity13			0
facts , you see , are incidental			0
because my daughter is n’t a headstrong 15 - year - old , but a seven - year - old			1
to a seven , eight or nine - year - old , heroes are invincible , to be admired unquestioningly			1
just as schoolboys will copy the exploits of their football idols , so will @entity13 ’s impressionable fans ape their every move			1
which is why it is so dispiriting that two of the stars — @entity30 and @entity26 — were filmed smoking pot and bragging about drug - taking			1
the video provided proof , if any were needed , that @entity13 are now a million miles from the sanitised image peddled to their target audience of tweenagers			2
the world ’s most successful boy band are most popular not with young women their own age , but with little girls like my daughter			1
like many parents of @entity13 fans , i ’ve spent the day hiding the newspaper and changing the tv channel when news about the band comes on			1
it is a short - term strategy			2
when this week ’s half - term is over , she will go back to school , and no titbit of @entity13 gossip eludes the fans in the playground			1
so i will have to find a way of explaining to a seven - year - old why taking drugs is bad			1
where to begin , when she does n’t even know what drugs are ? this is n’t the first time i ’ve had reservations about just how suitable her idols are for their tweenage fans			2
they seem to have changed radically since their launch on the 2010 series of @entity103			0
' dispiriting ' : a video has emerged showing @entity30 and @entity26 ( above ) smoking pot and bragging about drug - taking gone are the clean - cut hairstyles and fresh - faces , replaced by tattoos , celebrity girlfriends , all - night partying and half - naked pictures on social networking sites such as @entity114			1
surprising ? no , not really			0
but for parents like me , a genuine problem			0
it ’s @entity2 ’s eighth birthday next week , and a few months ago she began lobbying for her present — tickets to @entity13 ’s @entity122 concert , on the eve of her birthday			2
more than 70,000 fans will be hanging on their heart - throbs ’ every word and gesture , and while plenty of girls @entity2 ’s age will be in the audience , as far as my wife and i are concerned , she is far too young to attend			1
this decision prompted hours of sobbing followed by weeks of whining , but today i feel utterly vindicated — not to mention furious at the young men who have let my little girl down			1
heart - throbs : @entity30 ( left ) and @entity26 are pictured performing at the @entity139 in @entity140 last night influential : @entity13 's impressionable fans will ape their every move , says @entity1			1
above , @entity30 and @entity26 because , while i ’m sure men will prove themselves unworthy of my daughter in future , i did n’t know it would happen so soon			1
how could they show her and their other young fans so little respect ? do they care so little about the impressionable kids who will now turn to their parents to ask why @entity26 was smoking something called ‘ @entity156 ’ ? it seems they do n’t care at all			1
because , as well as the cannabis smoking , the footage shows a sarcastic exchange between @entity162 ( or ‘ @entity163 ’ , as their dedicated young fans refer to the duo ) about how they need a more mature image			1
@entity13 ’s last book , according to @entity30 , was ‘ so girly and not cool ’			2
their voices dripping with scorn , their contempt for such childish content is palpable			0
concern : @entity1 is pictured with his wife @entity173 , daughter @entity2 and four - year - old son , @entity174 these are the same books which i spent £ 17 a pop on for @entity179 ’s last birthday and @entity180 presents , contributing to @entity30 ’s personal £ 14 million fortune			1
@entity30 and @entity26 say they want to grow up , yet their band is sold to the public via @entity13 lunchboxes , stickers and dolls			1
how many fashionable teenagers do they expect to wear one direction pyjamas and onesies ? the money brought in by these ventures borders on the obscene and they would be taking us for fools if they denied the ‘ tween ’ market is at the heart of it			2
today , i wish i could send every @entity198 , poster and bit of plastic tat back			0
i find myself utterly furious at the downright stupidity of these spoiled fools			0
what they fail to understand is that with their privilege comes a debt — and a responsibility — to their fans			0
this dope smoking act was never part of the bargain			0
when @entity13 were launched by @entity216 they were squeaky clean			0
early promotional shots are almost unrecognisable alongside the tattooed , brooding figures we see today			0
like those tattoos , the change has crept upon us slowly			0
@entity25 and @entity26 have hooked up with pop star girlfriends ( the latter being caught cheating on his with a barmaid )			2
@entity225 risked his life to pose for a photograph standing on the roof of a skyscraper ( he apologised , grudgingly , but @entity2 thought it was a hoot )			2
' all about money ' : @entity13 open the @entity234 leg of their world tour , where we are , in @entity140 last night then last year @entity30 and @entity26 were spotted smoking a suspicious looking roll - up cigarette on a yacht			1
this latest footage is no storm in a teacup			0
it strikes at the very heart of the band ’s existence			0
for one direction are all about money , as you would expect of any ‘ artist ’ launched by @entity216			0
he is dealing with the fallout personally , in the knowledge he stands to miss out on a fortune if his protégées do n’t weather the storm			0
their current tour is a gruelling 88 - date extravaganza which will see them take in @entity260 and @entity261 and much of @entity262 , something which would put pressure on even the most energetic young performer			2
once merchandising is taken into consideration , the tour is forecast to gross $ 1 billion , making it the biggest in history			0
worry : @entity1 and his wife decided to ban their daughter from going to @entity13 's @entity122 concert there was a time , not so long ago , when i saw @entity13 as a harmless distraction for my daughter and her friends			1
they were cheeky without being too risqué , while their movie was as funny and as inoffensive as @entity43 in @entity281			0
i even liked some of their songs			0
today the mask slipped , and all i can do is count my blessings that i banned @entity2 from going to that @entity122 concert .			2
