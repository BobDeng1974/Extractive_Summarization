more than 700 people were handed penalties for using @entity7 , in @entity8 , in the two weeks after the cctv camera was set up			1
but drivers believe the warning signs are ' woeful ' and have complained that they are constantly blocked by other vehicles			1
lucrative : @entity13 has raked in £ 600,000 in just two weeks by fining motorists who have been using the bus gates at @entity7 warnings : furious motorists say the signs are confusing and are often blocked by other vehicles council bosses have defended the system , insisting that the camera and the accompanying signs are adequate			1
furious architect @entity24 was given a fine after he was caught going through the bus gate			1
after submitting a freedom of information request to @entity13 , he discovered that he was not alone			0
he said : ' the signposting for the bus gate is woefully inadequate			0
i have no problems with bus lanes and improving traffic flows but the problem here is the bus gate is so badly signposted			0
' the sign in @entity38 @entity37 can often by obscured by traffic or a parked van , so motorists have no way of knowing they are about to break the rules			2
angry : architect @entity24 uncovered the vast number of penalties through a @entity26 after he was slapped with a £ 60 fine ' if the council really wanted to curb private cars going into @entity49 they would signpost it fully			1
' mr @entity24 lodged a freedom of information request with the city council asking how many cars contravened the bus gate from the day it went into operation on monday june 30 until wednesday july 16			1
on one of the days the camera was not in operation but , on the remaining 15 days , it caught a total of 10,096 motorists			2
the lowest number of breaches was on the first day of the new scheme , when 477 were nabbed , and the highest on friday , july 4 , when 802 went through the bus gate			0
blocked : he says the signs surrounding the gates are often obscured by other cars or lorries each motorist will be hit with a £ 60 fine , reduced to £ 30 if paid within 14 days			1
@entity72 , of the @entity73 , said the city council had failed to get information about the bus gate over to drivers			2
he added : ' clearly there is a complete failure of signpost information when so many people are getting caught			0
' a city council spokesman insisted the new traffic restriction is well signposted			2
he said : ' the majority of drivers do n’t receive fines as they do n’t choose to drive through a well publicised and very visible bus gate			2
signs : the council has defended the criticism and insists that the signs around the bus gate are adequate ' the number of offences has dropped by 65.7 per cent since the bus lane enforcement began and we expect further reductions			1
' seven permanent signs advising the bus gate is operational have been in place since the beginning of june and are clearly visible on @entity103 , @entity38 @entity37 , @entity104 and at @entity7			1
' in addition , there were two temporary signs on @entity108 and @entity38 @entity37 in the run up to the bus gate coming into play			0
' councils are using spy cameras to catch more and more drivers drivers are milked of more than £ 135million a year by spy cameras in bus lanes and box junctions , figures have revealed			2
a record 1.32million fines were issued for minor offences in 2011/12 , 16 per cent up on the year before			0
local authorities are using an increasing amount of technology to snare motorists - and are collecting a huge number of penalties in the process			0

they collared an average of 72 motorists a day for bus lane infringements over 12 weeks in spring			0
however more than £ 1.8m was paid back to motorists after they were fined for driving over a bridge in @entity139			1
almost 60,000 motorists were issued with penalty notices for using the @entity142 after controversial traffic restrictions were introduced			0
@entity144 was also forced to hand back more than £ 1m to motorists fined for illegally using its new bus lanes - because the signposts were not adequately marked			1
in terms of parking fines , cctv cameras mounted on cars - that have generated around £ 300million in the last five years will be made illegal			2
some 75 councils currently have permission to use ‘ approved devices ’ rather than traffic wardens to enforce parking restrictions , under @entity158 ’s 2004 @entity157			0
in these areas , a third of all parking fines are now thought to be issued via @entity164 rather than parking wardens .			0

10,000 drivers were fined for using @entity7 in @entity8
motorists claim that the warnings are hidden by other cars and confusing
architect @entity24 , who was fined £ 60 , *claims* the signs are ' woeful '
but council bosses have insisted the signs and camera are adequate
