forget @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 , the top seven would be seriously challenged by ' @entity4 ' should this manager have had a full season in charge at one club			0
that is after @entity10 , managed by @entity11 , beat @entity12 2 - 1 at @entity13 on monday night , the @entity16 manager 's ninth win in @entity17 since leaving his role at @entity19 at the end of december			1
his former club have since plummeted in the @entity22 while @entity10 now find themselves threatening the top half , and combining his records at both clubs this season would see ' @entity4 ' sit in eighth place , just five points behind @entity29			1
@entity11 could be a candidate for manager of the year with his record at @entity19 and @entity10 the @entity22 table with @entity4 in - as well as a team complied from pre / post @entity4 results @entity19 fans were calling for @entity4 's head for many years , seen as owner @entity39 's puppet , and were sitting in 10th place when the 53 - year - old returned ' home ' to @entity10			1
the @entity10 were in the relegation zone along with @entity44 and @entity45 , struggling to pick up points following @entity48 's sacking			0
but while @entity49 has picked up just nine points in his 12 games in charge at @entity53 , @entity4 's @entity10 now have 39 points and are comfortably above the drop zone			1
a team compiled with @entity19 and @entity10 's stats pre / post @entity4 would be sitting in 19th ( albeit with 22 @entity22 clubs now technically involved )			2
a top - half finish is now the aim for @entity4 and his men , as @entity63 supporters still fear relegation following a 1 - 0 derby defeat to @entity66 on @entity67			0
@entity4 celebrates with his @entity19 team and @entity69 after his goal against @entity71 in november @entity19 fans hold a banner calling the removal of @entity4 in a @entity22 game at @entity1 in september @entity49 's @entity63 side are not safe from relegation yet after a 1 - 0 defeat at the hands of @entity66 it all started with a 4 - 0 win at @entity81 in the @entity82 and now @entity10 have won four in five , most recently beating the champions			1
his stock will continue to rise with this table , which would put him just six points adrift of @entity88 in fifth			0
@entity4 has recently insisted he would perform at a top club , better than monday 's counterpart @entity91 at least , while he is definitely a contender for @entity93 award			0
and nobody would have predicted that in 2014			0
@entity96 celebrates after netting the opening goal during @entity10 's victory over @entity12			2

@entity10 beat @entity12 2 - 1 at @entity13 on monday
@entity17 side are 11th in @entity22 table and look to be safe
@entity11 left @entity19 in 10th place when he departed in december
@entity49 's side have only picked up nine points since
' @entity4 ' would be eighth in the table five points behind @entity29
