graffiti : historic graves in the @entity15 have been defaced with the message ' no @entity5 ' around a dozen gravestones near the statue were also defaced with the anti-religious scrawls			1
in addition , the lodge at the entrance to the @entity32 had swastikas scrawled into its wooden doors			2
@entity36 has sent a team of workers to clean up the mess - and is now being urged to take further steps to secure the cemetery			2
local resident @entity42 said : ' i think it is disgusting			2
there are people buried in there , so it is absolutely disrespectful for people to be vandalising or spray painting on the gravestones			2
' it is such a nice place for the public to visit			0
we need to get the message out that it is not ok for people to act like this			0
i think there should be more patrols looking out for this sort of thing			0
' well - known : the statue of religious reformer @entity19 was one of the memorial targeted fury : locals and tourists have called for greater action by the city council to safeguard the graves student @entity74 said he was worried that tourists would be more likely to remember the vandalism than the historic charms of the cemetery itself			1
' it 's mindless vandalism , ' he said			0
' i do n't think there 's any point of it			0
it 's one of the things that people will remember			0

' we think it 's a beautiful place			0
it spoils it a bit and we 're sad to see it but it 's how things are these days			0
' sick : this is not the first time the historic cemetery has been hit by malicious vandalism picturesque : the beautiful site was ruined by the actions of the unknown vandals around 50,000 people have been laid to rest at the 37 - acre @entity15 , which is behind @entity112 , and 3,500 tombs have been built there			1
