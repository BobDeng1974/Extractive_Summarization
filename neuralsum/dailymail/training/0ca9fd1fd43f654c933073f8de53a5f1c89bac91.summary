by @entity0 a long - time @entity2 clergyman has admitted to sexually abusing nearly a dozen boys since the 1960s but says he never viewed his actions as a crime			1
former priest @entity6 testified recently in court during a lawsuit against the archdiocese of @entity10 and @entity11 that he first admitted to abusing children in 1964 , but that no action was taken and he remained in the parish			1
he also told prosecutors that he saw his actions as a sin and never realized how serious his transgressions were until multiple lawsuits starting being filed against the church			0
the comments were made during testimony for one of those suits			0
' i looked at it more as a sin than … a crime , ' said the disgraced ex-priest			0
admitted pedophile : former priest @entity6 , who is at the center of a lawsuit against the @entity10 - @entity11 archdiocese , has admitted to sexually abusing several boys @entity6 ’s testimony in the latest lawsuit to reach courts , from a boy alleging abuse in the 1970s , is damning			1
the former high school basketball coach is accused of abusing 37 boys , but previously admitted to only 10 instances			1
the pedophile was removed from the priesthood in 2009 – 45 years after his first admission of guilt			2
he conceded when asked in his most recent court appearance about how many boys he abused that he was n’t sure			2
‘ i do n’t know			0
i ’d have to study that out			0
’ he said according to an affidavit cited by the @entity51			0
he has also conceded to not even remembering the names of some of his victims			0
@entity6 began his time in the @entity56 at the @entity57 in 1961			1
he was soon met with allegations of abuse from some of the boys he was coaching on a high school basketball team			1
‘ i had abused a boy there , and he reported it to another priest , ’ @entity6 recalled			1
he admitted to the abuse but was allowed to remain in his position without any warnings to parents or school officials , according to the paper where some of the abuse happened : the @entity74 church where @entity6 says some of the boys were abused @entity6 also admitted abusing at least two other boys only 14 - years - old during the same school year , ‘ probably in the gym or school ’ a couple of times			1
‘ i was coaching again and they [ his victims ] were on the team , ’ he said			0
the only action taken was to transfer him to the bigger @entity87 of @entity10 and @entity11			2
he admits to abusing two brothers in a number of places including a car , hotel , ymca and even a sauna			0
the church sent him to a therapist instead of reporting him to the police			0
‘ where it was leading me or if it helped , i do n’t know that , ’ he admitted			0
when asked if anyone had ever told him what he was doing was a crime , he replied : ‘ i do n’t remember that , no. ’ several other allegations came in the decades that followed , and @entity6 says the last boy he was abused was in the early 1980s – but court records proved he abused at least one boy until 1987			1
the admitted abuser stayed in his position as a priest until 2009 , when he left after being asked to do so voluntarily			2
@entity6 's pension , health and dental insurance remain in place			2
he faces no jail time because the state of @entity2 's statute of limitations on child sex crimes gives victims only seven years from the time of the crime to press criminal charges , victims also only had until the age of 24 to file a civil suit until a new child sex liability law was passed last year by the state legislature .			1

former priest @entity6 has admitted to abusing several young boys since 1961
he says he confessed to the abuse but no action was taken
allegations involving dozens of boys came in the following decades
@entity6 remained in the @entity56 until 2009
he faces no jail time because the crimes are well past the state 's @entity142 for child sex allegations
