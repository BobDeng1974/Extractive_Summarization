by @entity0 for any parent , having to accept your child needs psychiatric drugs must be agonising			2
but when @entity7 's 13 - year - old daughter @entity6 suffered a breakdown after a vicious campaign of school bullying , it seemed the only option - as instructed by @entity13 psychiatrists			1
however @entity7 , a secretary from @entity14 , @entity15 , was horrified by the physical and mental damage the antipsychotic medication wreaked on her daughter			1
@entity6 's ordeal began when she simply fell out with a clique of girls - the situation steadily worsened and she faced constant online bullying as well as being physically attacked in class			1
gangs started to follow her home , and the family house and car were damaged			2
neither the police nor school seemed able to do anything			2
strain : @entity34 , age 10 ( left ) before her ordeals began , and age 13 ( right ) , several months after she was diagnosed with schizophrenia and started taking antipsychotics under this terrible strain , @entity6 began to break down			1
after months of sleeplessness and extreme anxiety , she said she 'd begun to hear voices in her head			2
her mother sought medical help			2
instead of being offered counselling and social support , @entity6 was diagnosed by a psychiatrist as having ' first - rank schizophrenia ' , which means she had signs of the condition			1
@entity7 was initially sceptical , but was so anxious to get help she reluctantly agreed to @entity6 being given medication - this was @entity56 , an antipsychotic that changes the way chemicals in the brain work			2
' the results were shocking , ' recalls @entity7			2
' after only a matter of weeks , her slim body ballooned , her legs were like tree trunks , her eyes became dead - looking , her hair was lank and she felt constantly tired			2
' although her ' schizophrenic ' symptoms were relieved , she was bullied even more			2
worried , @entity7 researched the drug			1
' the official information said it had never been trialled on children			1
@entity6 wanted to come off it , so i agreed			0
' worryingly , @entity6 seemed to relapse , suffering from hallucinations again			0
' but in fact , she was suffering withdrawal symptoms from the drug , ' says @entity7 , and after weeks of agony , the symptoms began to subside			1
the solution to her problems was to move school			0
@entity7 , now a single mother , scrimped and saved to send @entity6 to a theatre school - ' it was the making of her , ' she says			0
' my daughter has wanted to be an actress since she was four			0
it gave her an interest - and an interest is a way of distracting a child from trauma			0
' @entity6 is 22 now and is , says her mother , ' happy and on @entity97 '			0
she 's starting her career on the stage , having graduated with a university degree in theatre arts			1
' the truth is that my daughter never had “ first - rank schizophrenia ” - she was being bullied and was under terrible stress			0
' dismissive : @entity7 has become a vociferous critic of the psychiatric community 's readiness to label children as mentally ill and give them potentially damaging drugs @entity7 is full of scorn for the psychiatric community 's readiness to label children as mentally ill then give them powerful and potentially damaging drugs			1
she 's become a vociferous critic on the subject , appearing at conferences and pressure groups around @entity119			1
she is particularly dismissive of the way psychiatrists often make their diagnosis using the profession 's ' bible ' , the @entity120 ( @entity121 ) , just published in its fifth version			1
the manual is written by an influential committee of @entity131 psychiatrists and lists official diagnoses and symptoms - its clinical definitions are used by professionals the world over as a guide for labelling psychiatric illnesses , and giving drug treatment			1
one of the major criticisms is that the number of new psychiatric diagnoses added to it is rising exponentially			0
in 1952 , the manual was 130 pages long			0
the fifth edition has 992 pages			0
and this latest edition has controversially added new diagnoses such as ' @entity150 ' , which essentially makes children 's temper tantrums a mental illness			1
critics believe the manuals are ' disease mongering ' - inventing labels for conditions that do n't really exist , but are normal , albeit difficult , facets of human nature			0
' if you look at the @entity121 there is a diagnosis for everyone			1
but there is no scientific proof to back many of them , ' says @entity7 , adding , only half in jest : ' no doubt they would have a diagnosis for me , as i have challenged the psychiatrists about their care			1
' one might expect such scepticism from a mother with a bad experience of the psychiatric profession			0
but the fact is that spiralling numbers of @entity119 children are being diagnosed with ' mental health problems ' that may often be merely behavioural			1
disturbingly , this trend is affecting children at ever younger ages			1
recent @entity119 figures show that 650,000 children between the ages of eight and 13 are on the drug @entity191 for the behavioural problem , @entity193 ( @entity193 ) - up from just 9,000 two decades ago			1
and now one of the world 's leading psychiatrists has blown the lid off this burgeoning problem			1
dr @entity199 chaired the taskforce that wrote the previous version of the @entity121 , in 1994			0
at the time , he was described by the @entity202 as ' the most powerful psychiatrist in @entity131 '			0
but now he admits his version of the manual helped open the floodgates for an epidemic of over-diagnosis of children 's mental illness and mass over-medication , with potentially devastating side - effects			1
' in the past 20 years , diagnosis rates of @entity193 have tripled , while autistic disorder and childhood bipolar disorder have each increased by a remarkable 40-fold , ' says dr @entity218 , an emeritus professor at @entity219 in @entity220			1
' this is not because our kids have suddenly become sicker , it 's just that diagnoses are applied to them more loosely			1
' he fears the latest edition will make the problem even worse			0
the result has been a bonanza for the pharmaceutical industry			0
for example over the past 20 years , the worldwide value of the market for @entity193 drugs alone has grown from £ 11 million to £ 11 billion a year			1
and the long - term effects of these drugs on children remains a perilous unknown , because rigorous safety checks were not performed on children before the medicines were launched			1
' it is a mass public health experiment that has been done without anyone 's informed consent , ' says dr @entity218			1
' we have no idea about the long - term effects			0
' we do know that in the short term antipsychotic drugs cause tremendous weight gain			0
a child weighing 110lb will put on 12lb in only 12 weeks			0
this is bound to be a factor for diabetes and heart disease			0
there is also controversy over whether the long - term use of brain - stimulating drugs causes children to grow up likely to become adult drug abusers			1
' the fear is that @entity191 - type medications are so similar to amphetamine or cocaine they create addictive yearnings in young brains that may lead to later drug abuse			2
there are also concerns that @entity193 medication damages young brains in similar ways to cocaine which , ironically , may make them into impulsive and antisocial adults			1
' whatever the long - term effect of these stimulant medications , we do know that they are being over-used massively because of over-diagnosis , ' says dr @entity218			0
' and being wrongly told you have a mental problem at a young age can have a crippling effect for life			2
' he is particularly worried by the new addition to @entity121 of @entity150			0
' the idea of turning temper tantrums into a mental disorder is terrible , ' he says			2
@entity295 , ' the criteria for diagnosing it were pretty much conjured out of thin air '			0
growth : over the past 20 years , the worldwide value of the market for @entity193 drugs alone has grown from £ 11 million to £ 11 billion a year tellingly , in @entity303 , where they shun the @entity121 , the proportion of kids diagnosed and medicated for @entity193 is less than half a per cent			1
in @entity119 it 's around 4 per cent			2
the @entity306 is keen to play down the influence of the manual , however			0
' @entity13 psychiatrists in their daily practice tend to use another set of psychiatric - illness classifications - the @entity313 , which is published by the @entity314 , ' says a spokeswoman			0
' the @entity306 recognises there are some valid criticisms of the @entity121 approach			0
all diagnostic classifications in medicine have been , and always will be , evolving and ready to be improved in response to new scientific evidence			0
' in the meantime there is more medication on the way			0
in february the @entity119 drug regulator granted a licence for a new class of @entity193 drug , @entity331 , approved for children six and older who have n't responded to @entity191 - type medication , despite a list of known side - effects , such as anxiety , weight loss , stunted growth and heart problems			1
as dr @entity218 knows only too well , it is very easy to add new diagnoses and drugs for children			2
but it is very difficult indeed to reverse this pharmaceutical tide			0
as his interview with @entity348 drew to a close , he gave a deep sigh and warned : ' we are turning childhood into a disease			0
' saving @entity354 : an insider 's @entity356 , @entity121 , @entity357 , and the @entity358 , by dr @entity199 is published by @entity359 .			2

spiraling numbers of children are being diagnosed with mental health issues
and the trend is affecting children at ever younger ages
over the last 20 years , diagnosis rates of @entity193 have tripled
the @entity193 drug market 's value has grown from £ *11million* to £ *11billion* a year
