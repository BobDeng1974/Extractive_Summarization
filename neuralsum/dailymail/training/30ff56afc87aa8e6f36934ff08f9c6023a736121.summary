not so one phd student who has taken healthy eating to a whole new level			2
@entity10 has admitted he eats tens of thousands of insects in a bid to ward off heart disease			1
he is pictured with a locust pizza - one of his staple dishes the 24 - year - old has gorged on more than 10,000 crickets , 5,000 locusts and 1,000 waxworms			1
a typical day for mr @entity10 consists of freeze - dried locust oatmeal for breakfast , a cricket sandwich for lunch and a plate of waxworm tacos for dinner			1
mr @entity10 believes eating insects is the most effective way of preventing high cholesterol and , therefore , heart disease			1
and the diet is particularly poignant as he has a strong and tragic family history of heart disease			1
to raise awareness about the health benefits of insect eating , mr @entity10 gives talks around the world and even hosts bug tasting events to encourage others to sample the tiny critters			1
mr @entity10 , from @entity48 , explains that it was a chain of medical scares among his relatives that prompted him to totally transform his diet			1
crunchy crickets : mr @entity10 started researching low cholesterol diets when he discovered that he had a very strong family history of heart disease			1
he discovered that insects are very low in cholesterol tasty grub : on a typical day mr @entity10 eats freeze - dried locust oatmeal for breakfast , a cricket sandwich for lunch and a plate of waxworm tacos ( pictured ) for dinner he said : ‘ it all started when my uncle died of a heart attack at the young age of 45			1
then a few months later , another one of my uncles suffered a heart attack , needing triple bypass surgery			2
‘ when my aunt suffered a stroke not long after , my family realised that this was no coincidence and that something much worse was going on			2
‘ we all had our cholesterol levels tested and my mum and each of her seven siblings were diagnosed with dangerously high levels of cholesterol			2
‘ their diagnosis really jolted me			0
i was still young and i knew that i had to act now to avoid suffering the same fate as the rest of my family			2
‘ everything i ’ve read points to the fact that eating bugs is the surest way of avoiding heart disease			1
it is the healthiest lifestyle out there			0
’ mr @entity10 - who is completing his doctoral research in @entity101 at the @entity102 - first ate insects on a fieldtrip to @entity105 in 2009			1
a maggoty meal : mr @entity10 has gorged on more than 10,000 crickets , 5,000 locusts and 1,000 waxworms ‘ a native tribe brought some three - inch - long , barbecued beetle larvae for us to try			1
it was just like an incredible explosion of taste in my mouth , i had never eaten anything like it , ’ he said			2
but it was only in 2011 that @entity10 started doing more research into insect eating - or ‘ entomophagy ’			1
he said : ‘ heart disease is caused by high cholesterol and the only source of cholesterol is saturated fats			1
studies show that insects have significantly less saturated fats than other edible animal meat that ’s out there			2
‘ even if you do n’t eat meat , the typical vegetarian option you ’d get in a pub is laden with saturated fats			0
but in bugs , it ’s negligible			0
last summer the @entity138 suggested that eating bugs could be the solution to worldwide food shortages			1
it said insects are a good source of protein and contain a range of minerals			2
some beetles , ants , crickets and grasshoppers come close to lean red meat in terms of protein per gram			2
they can be rich in copper , iron , magnesium , manganese , phosphorous , selenium and zinc			0
they are also a source of fibre and are lower in cholesterol than beef or pork			2
crickets are also a course of calcium			2
‘ not only that , insects have twice as much protein than beef and far more omega - 3 fatty acids than in fish			2
in fact , research has shown that 100g of locusts for example has more nutrients than other meat			1
’ these findings led mr @entity10 to start incorporating bugs into his diet - combining insect protein with the normal meat dishes he ate			1
he said : ‘ the first recipe i ever created with bugs was by blending beef mince with locusts in a food processor and making burgers out of them			2
‘ it took a lot of improvisation but the final product was delicious			0
the locusts gave the burgers a really nutty aroma			2
‘ i started experimenting more with the recipe and a few attempts later , i was able to make the burgers entirely out of locusts			1
soon after , i decided to entirely cut other meats from my diet			0
’ mr @entity10 began experimenting in the kitchen , rustling up dishes like locust pizza , waxworm tagine and cricket - filled nut roast			1
for desert , he would bake mealworm cakes and puddings			0
he said : ‘ the trick to cooking bugs is seeing them as you would any other meat - it ’s about looking at a cricket as if it ’s a chicken fillet or a king prawn			0
‘ you can whack some locusts in sweet chilli sauce for a stir - fry or stick some waxworms in pasta sauce to make a bug - @entity228			1
’ since embarking on the insect eating lifestyle , mr @entity10 claims he has never felt better			1
tummy bug : mr @entity10 said : ' heart disease is caused by high cholesterol and the only source of cholesterol is saturated fats			1
studies show that insects have significantly less saturated fats than other animal meat ' he said : ‘ i ’m the picture of health now			0
before , my weight used to fluctuate			0
but as a result of eating bugs which are such a lean meat , i ’ve maintained a healthy weight of 10st 10lbs			0
‘ my energy levels have vastly improved too and i believe that ’s down to how insects - like grasshoppers for example - have 10 times more iron than other meats			0
‘ i ’m only in my twenties and was lucky to not be diagnosed with high cholesterol like the rest of my family			1
a diet rich in bugs is the ultimate preventive measure			0
’ mr @entity10 admits that in spite of his endorsement of their health benefits , some of his family and friends are repulsed by his bug chomping ways : ‘ a few of my mates think it ’s really weird and will never accept it			1
bug - eyed : mr @entity10 said : ' the trick to cooking bugs is seeing them as you would any other meat - it 's about looking at a cricket as if it 's a chicken fillet or a king prawn ' ‘ my mum meanwhile has made it clear that she will never eat an insect			1
it does n’t matter what i do - i could never convince her to try it			0
‘ it ’s a shame			0
people have this idea that insects are dirty but they are not at all			0
the livestock we eat are pumped with hormones and drugs			0
‘ but insects effectively only feed on leaves and you can breed them in a very hygienic warehouse			0
they are the cleanest and freshest form of meat			0
’ one person that mr @entity10 has managed to convert , however , is his girlfriend of six months , @entity306 , 21			1
he said : ‘ when i first told @entity306 that i ate bugs , she was intrigued			0
then after a night - out , i cooked her some locusts in tomato sauce and she loved it ! ‘ now we often eat insects together			1
for a romantic date , i might make her something special like a roasted butternut squash infused with some locust heads			0
’ a hive of activity : mr @entity10 no longer eats any meat or fish other than insects			1
he is pictured making waxworm tacos for his dinner opening up a can of worms : mr @entity325 ( pictured making sweet chilli locusts ) says some of his friends have struggled to get their heads around his new diet			1
but , his girlfriend is happy to join him for an insect burger mr @entity10 orders his insects from a live breeder in @entity334 and admits their costly retail price in the @entity337 is a downside to the lifestyle			1
he said : ‘ apart from me , the only other living things who really eat insects in @entity337 are people ’s pet reptiles and birds			0
so i ’ve got to pay premium rates for these bugs - a bag of locusts will set you back around £ 9			0
‘ my dream is to eventually have my own insect - growing sanctuary , where i can breed my own crickets , locusts , dung beetles and mealworms to eat			2
’ although mr @entity10 initially began consuming bugs for their health benefits , he admits that now his appetite for insects is insatiable			1
he said : ‘ i get cravings for them - i have to make sure that my freezer is always stocked up with crickets and worms			0
lovely locusts : mr @entity10 says he has never felt better than since he started eating insects ‘ i just love the taste of insects , they ’re very pleasant			1
but it ’s their texture which i like the most - that subtle crunch and the squish when you bite through it			0
‘ my favourite species to eat are locusts			0
they have an inherently sweet flavour and their heads are really nutty			0
’ as well as enjoying the taste of bugs , mr @entity10 also believes that they are a sustainable way of feeding our rapidly expanding global population			2
he said : ‘ the amount of water , grain and resources that you need to rear livestock is ridiculous			0
‘ the wastage is far less with bugs			0
if people ate less cow , sheep , pig and chicken and ate more insects instead , everything would balance			0
for instance , there would be more grain for people who are starving			0

@entity10 has eaten 10,000 crickets , 5,000 locusts , 1,000 waxworms
he started eating insects after discovering a strong family history of heart disease and carrying out research which suggested insects cut cholesterol
he eats locust oatmeal for breakfast , a cricket sandwich for lunch and waxworm tacos for dinner and he says he has never felt better
