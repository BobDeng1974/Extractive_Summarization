exclusive access to a swimming pool and no queues for flumes seems like a treat restricted to the rich and famous			0
but two friends made it a reality when they hid in the changing rooms of @entity9 in @entity10 so they could swim and ride on as many flumes as they wanted after dark			1
the pair had the run of the @entity10 leisure centre during the evening , using the flumes , a children 's slide , clambering over an ornamental crocodile and even skinny dipping			1
@entity21 , 26 , and @entity22 , 27 , filmed themselves riding the flumes and swimming after the lights had gone out			1
mr @entity21 , a media student at @entity37 said : ' i had planned it for about a month or two and then one day i just said to @entity40 we should do it on that night because we were bored			2
' we hid in the changing rooms for about 40 minutes before we came out			1
' the cleaner was cleaning the changing rooms so we quickly went in one they had already cleaned and just sat there			1
the pair filmed themselves getting exclusive use of the flumes and jumping into the swimming pool naked @entity22 ( left ) and @entity21 filmed their escapade in the leisure centre before posting the video online ' we had to hide our clothes because we could n't use the lockers and just waited for the lights to go off and the security to leave			1
' he said after the cleaners left at about 9pm the pair went into the pool , staying there about two hours			2
' it was quite hot in there because the air con had been turned off so when we were jumping in the pool it was nice and cool , ' he added			0
' we had such a laugh in there and stayed till about 11pm , the flumes were switched off but because of the water it was still slippery so we could still use them a bit			2
' i have n't had a call from the centre or the police yet , and i do n't think i would do it again at that pool because the security will be really tight now			0
' i might consider doing it at another pool further away though , you never know			0
' @entity21 posted the video on his @entity88 page and said it has already been shared multiple times the pair used flumes after they had been turned off , saying remaining moisture meant they were still slippery the friends have been criticised by security bosses who said they could have created a dangerous situation mr @entity21 posted an edited video on @entity88 , called @entity9 after hours night edition			1
' the one minute and 26 second clip features pictures of the pair hanging off rides and ends with the caption ' i 'm never growing up			0
' at the end the pair bid their viewers farewell and said the escapade had been ' emotional			0
' the video has already been shared by dozens of his friends			0
@entity113 ( @entity114 ) in @entity115 , @entity10 , has condemned the stunt			2
@entity117 said : ' there was a breach of @entity114 's security measures on sunday evening with two persons hiding themselves on purpose within the building at @entity9			2
@entity21 decided to stay in the leisure centre after dark because he was bored and had been planning it @entity22 is pictured riding one of the flumes at the leisure centre after he hid until cleaners left at 9pm the friends filmed themselves climbing over an ornamental crocodile as well as on the centre 's flumes ' this resulted in them being in the building at a time when it was locked			1

' @entity114 are in liaison with @entity146 on this matter with the most appropriate action being taken in due course			0
