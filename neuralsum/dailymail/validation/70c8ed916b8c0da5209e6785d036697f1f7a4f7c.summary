@entity0 took only 79 seconds to open his account for @entity2 , but there are two other players who took even less time to find the back of the net on their debuts			2
the @entity10 striker continued his sensational scoring form this season by netting the final goal in @entity2 's 4 - 0 @entity15 qualifier defeat of @entity16 shortly after coming on at @entity17 on friday night			1
however , the 21 - year - old 's strike was precisely a minute slower than legendary @entity10 manager @entity20 while @entity21 also scored in less than half the time on his debut for the @entity2			1
@entity0 wheels away after taking just 79 seconds to score his first international goal the @entity10 striker headed in at the far post from a @entity26 cross shortly after coming at @entity17 @entity2 debutant 's fastest goals : @entity20 19secs @entity21 30 @entity0 79 @entity20 scored after only 19 seconds against @entity29 in 1951			1
he remains the only player to have scored for @entity2 with his first touch in international football and subsequently never play at that level again			0
@entity21 , who was also the first @entity34 to play for the national team , was on target after 30 seconds against @entity37 in 1919			0
@entity21 would go on to win only one more cap , scoring against @entity39 in 1920			0
@entity0 had scored just one @entity41 goal when @entity43 's men last took to the field more than four months ago , but his rise has been so rapid that the striker 's introduction at @entity17 was met by a standing ovation on friday			2
@entity20 ( left ) and @entity21 ( right ) both scored faster goals than @entity0 on their @entity2 debuts @entity0 celebrates as @entity2 cruise to a 4 - 0 victory over lowly @entity52 on friday night @entity53 to read how the @entity10 striker fared on his @entity2 bow @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity26 netted the others , but the headlines belonged to just one man after this one - sided @entity15 qualifier			1
asked if he knew how long he had taken to open his account , @entity0 said : ' maybe a minute ? eighty seconds ? hey , it 's not too bad ! ' it 's the start i dreamed of , it 's a little bit of a blur at the minute			2
' it 's the best moment by far , to represent your country at senior level is the top			0
hopefully i can keep doing it and it 's the first of many			0
