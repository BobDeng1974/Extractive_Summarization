@entity1 is hiring thousands of cheap @entity3 workers to staff its warehouse , it has been claimed a major @entity8 retailer is hiring thousands of cheap @entity3 workers to staff its warehouse in an area where more than 200,000 are on the dole , it has been claimed			1
a former member of staff at @entity1 has revealed how ' busloads ' of @entity15 workers started arriving at the company 's warehouse in @entity18 in @entity19 earlier this month			1
it comes as it was revealed more than 218,000 are out of work in the @entity23 and @entity19 area with unemployment higher than average			1
an agency based in @entity27 has claimed next , run by conservative peer @entity28 , has already taken on 7,000 staff from @entity15			1
former worker @entity31 , 63 , a retired cleaner , is reported as saying : ' they would suddenly turn up in busloads , seven coaches at a time			0
' they were bringing them in every day by minibus from places like @entity41 and @entity42			2
they were happy on the money because they got so little working back home in @entity15			1
' they were on the minimum wage			0
' the eastern @entity3 work force was reported to be arriving to fill ' minimum wage ' jobs weeks before the posts were advertised in the @entity8			1
@entity1 has said it is currently using about 250 @entity15 staff but that it takes on about 500 a year and that it advertises in @entity15 first because it is more time consuming to take on workers from abroad			1
it advertised the jobs in @entity8 on november 19 and says 100 jobs are still up for grabs at @entity18			1
a spokesman told @entity60 today : ' we simply ca n't recruit enough people locally			1
' @entity15 jobs agency @entity63 was said to be fielding a hundred calls a day looking for employment at @entity1			1
the firm 's operations director @entity66 told the @entity68 that 350 people were going to work at @entity1 but that it had already sent 7,000			1
@entity15 workers started arriving at the company 's warehouse in @entity18 in @entity19 earlier this month , it has been claimed			1
the plant is pictured from above he said wages on offer were up to four times the amount @entity15 workers would earn for the same role in their homeland			1
buses started arriving at the warehouse earlier this month with @entity83 arranging trips from @entity27 at £ 100 a head , the @entity68 reports			1
its workers are offered places to stay for a weekly rent of up to £ 65 a week , the newspaper says			2
it comes just weeks after it was revealed that food manufacturer @entity91 was reportedly looking to recruit staff from @entity93 for a new £ 35 million factory due to open in @entity95 - as few people living in the area have applied for jobs			1
a @entity1 spokesman today told @entity60 that it needed to boost its recruitment on a temporary basis twice a year - for the @entity103 period and for late spring sales			1
an agency based in @entity27 has claimed next , run by conservative peer @entity28 ( pictured ) , has already taken on 7,000 staff from @entity15 he said : ' the local area can not support that level of demand for these short spikes			1
' he added that @entity15 and @entity8 workers get paid the same , which was minimum wage and which is topped up with a bonus scheme and that recruitment started earlier in @entity15 as the process for hiring foreign workers took longer			1
when asked what measures were taken to secure @entity8 workers , he said all available jobs were posted on the firm 's own website			1
' the bottom line is there are still 100 jobs available which have to be filled			1
' @entity1 does recruit from @entity15 and has for years - it can not fill its vacancies otherwise , ' the spokesman said			1
he added that @entity63 ' estimation of 7,000 staff having been sent over may well have been over the period of a number of years			2
nobody was available for comment when @entity60 contacted @entity63 this morning			0
@entity134 has signalled he is ready to lead @entity8 out of the @entity135 if other @entity135 states set their faces against tough new proposals to cut immigration			0
in a much - anticipated speech setting out plans to bar @entity135 migrants from claiming welfare for the first four years after arriving in the @entity8 and deport those who do not find jobs within six months , mr @entity134 warned that he will ' rule nothing out ' if other @entity3 states turn a deaf ear to @entity8 concerns			2
the prime minister insisted that he still hopes to be able to recommend an @entity152 vote in the referendum on @entity135 membership he has promised for 2017 , and said he was ' confident ' of success in the renegotiation of the terms of that membership he plans if conservatives win next year 's general election			1
@entity134 ( pictured ) has signalled he is ready to lead @entity8 out of the @entity135 if other @entity135 states set their faces against tough new proposals to cut immigration but he left no doubt that he has not ruled out recommending @entity8 exit if other @entity135 nations refuse to compromise on the principle of free movement and accept reforms that he said were ' radical ' but ' reasonable and fair '			0
welfare changes to cut migration from within the @entity135 ' significantly ' will be an ' absolute requirement ' in the renegotiation , he said			0
under his plans , @entity135 jobseekers without an offer of employment will not be allowed to claim the new @entity180 when they arrive in the @entity8 and will be required to leave if they do not find work within six months			2
migrants will be able to claim tax credits and child benefit and to apply for social housing only after four years in the country , and will receive no child benefit or child tax credit for offspring living abroad ' if you elect me as prime minister in may , i will negotiate to reform the @entity135 , and @entity8 's relationship with it , ' said mr @entity134			2
' this issue of free movement will be a key part of that negotiation			0
' if i succeed , i will , as i have said , campaign to keep this country in a reformed @entity135			0
' if our concerns fall on deaf ears and we can not put our relationship with the @entity135 on a better footing , then of course i rule nothing out			0
' but i am confident that , with goodwill and understanding , we can and will succeed			0
' @entity134 took a swipe at the @entity209 , under @entity210 ( pictured ) warning voters to ' distrust those who sell the snake oil of simple solutions ' speaking in @entity214 a day after official statistics showed net migration rising to 260,000 over the past year - 16,000 higher than when the coalition government came to office - mr @entity134 conceded that his policies had ' not been enough ' to meet the @entity220 target of cutting overall numbers to the tens of thousands by 2015			1
but he insisted that his reforms had made ' a real difference ' , cutting numbers of migrants from outside the @entity135 by as much as 50,000			0
he promised to ' go further ' if he wins next year 's election , by revoking the licences of colleges whose students overstay visas , extending ' deport first , appeal later ' rules and requiring landlords to check tenants ' immigration status			2
' the ambition remains the right one			0
but it 's clear : it 's going to take more time , more work and more difficult long - term decisions to get there , ' said mr @entity134			2
in a clear swipe at the @entity8 @entity244 , which has built support by highlighting public concerns over immigration , the prime minister warned voters to ' distrust those who sell the snake oil of simple solutions '			0
denouncing as ' appalling ' any suggestion of repatriating legal migrants , mr @entity134 said @entity8 was great ' because of immigration , not in spite of it ' , and insisted he was proud of the @entity8 's openness to incomers and its creation of ' a successful multi-racial democracy '			2
the isolationism of those who want to ' pull up the drawbridge ' and shut off immigration altogether is ' actually deeply unpatriotic ' , he said			0
' for the sake of @entity8 jobs , @entity8 livelihoods and @entity8 opportunities we must fight this dangerous and misguided view that our nation can withdraw from the world and somehow all will be well , ' said mr @entity134			2
but he also warned against the ' dangerous ' idea that immigration is not a problem and that it is racist to voice anxiety about it			0
' we should be clear , ' said the prime minister			0
' it is not wrong to express concern about the scale of people coming into the country			2
' people have understandably become frustrated			0
it boils down to one word : control			0
people want @entity290 to have control over the numbers of people coming here and the circumstances in which they come , both from around the world and from within the @entity135			0
' they want control over who has the right to receive benefits and what is expected of them in return			0
they want to know that foreign criminals can be excluded - or if already here , removed			0
and they want us to manage carefully the pressures on our schools , our hospitals and our housing			0
' if we are to maintain this successful open meritocratic democracy we treasure , we have to maintain faith in @entity290 's ability to control the rate at which people come to this country			2
' and yet in recent years , it has become clear that successive governments have lacked control			0
' mr @entity134 's speech in the @entity327 factory in @entity328 was briefly interrupted by an alarm bell , which he joked must have been triggered by a direct link to the @entity331 in @entity332			0
