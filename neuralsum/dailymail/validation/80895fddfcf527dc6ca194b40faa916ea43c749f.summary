the owner of a property near @entity2 where @entity3 daubed his ‘ @entity5 ’ artwork has claimed that the mural had made his life a misery after being given listed status			1
@entity10 could have expected a windfall after the work was sprayed onto the side of his end - of - terrace property close to @entity16 's surveillance centre in @entity17 , @entity18			1

mr @entity10 said : ‘ if @entity17 want it , they can have it			1
just buy the building off me , i just want to get on with my life			2
cut me free , you can have the @entity49			0
’ @entity5 features three 1950s - style agents , wearing brown trench coats and trilby hats , using devices to tap into conversations at a telephone box on the side of the £ 300,000 property			2
it appeared last april before soaring in value when @entity3 confirmed it was one of his pieces			0
the wall was boarded up but a bidding war ensued as locals tried to raise an estimated £ 1million to secure it for the town			0
a businessman claimed to have raised enough , but his bid fell through			0
protection : scaffolding was put up over the artwork after it was vandalised			2
after the stencil was granted @entity21 - listed status , mr @entity10 , 45 , has been unable to remove and sell it covering : it was feared the chunk of wall could be removed and sold , but last month @entity77 voted to incorporate the mural into the building ’s existing @entity21 - listed status it was feared the chunk of wall could be removed and sold , but last month @entity77 voted to incorporate the mural into the building ’s existing @entity21 - listed status			1
this means mr @entity10 - whose home is thought to have tripled in value since the mural was painted - now can not carry out urgent repairs to strengthen and re-render the walls			1
he said : ‘ if this had been any other artist , it [ the listed status ] would have been laughed out of the chambers			1
i have no idea where i go from here			0
' mr @entity10 said he could fight the decision , but that would mean him spending his own money to launch a case at the @entity99			1
he said the council ‘ agreed in principle ’ to protect the mural when he first approached them for help			0

mr @entity10 said he has had ' substantial offers from people who collect this kind of artwork ' ‘ they just said “ you ca n’t put that on there ” and i was threatened with a fine			1
' he added : ' i think it deserves to stay in @entity17 , but obviously it is difficult to re-render a house that has that artwork on it			1
‘ it ’s sat empty now , and it ca n’t stay that way forever			0
at the end of the day , we can sit and let gravity take an effect and the decision will be made for us			0

' there ’s not a " pretty strong certainty " that i own it - it is certain that i do			0
i take a bit of umbrage with people getting involved with my business when it ’s nothing to do with them			0
‘ i ’ve had substantial offers from people who collect this kind of artwork - and if it was about money for me i ’d have sold it by now			2
’ after listed status was granted last month , the council 's case officer @entity184 said : ' it will be afforded a greater level of protection than it has currently			1
' but it does n't mean we wo n't be faced with future applications to consider other changes to it			0
it [ planning consent ] does n't automatically mean it 's going to be retained in situ			2
