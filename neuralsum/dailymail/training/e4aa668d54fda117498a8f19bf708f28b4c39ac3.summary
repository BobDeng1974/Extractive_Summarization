mr @entity35 added : ‘ if @entity22 had come back and said no pay increase , which it 's done for the last few years , nobody minds and everybody accepts it			2
‘ but do n't change the rules if you do n't quite like the result			0
‘ it 's not up to leaders to start dictating , like it 's not up to me to dictate to other @entity25			2
‘ we 're on slightly more money than other backbenchers and therefore we should n't be saying that you should n't have a pay rise			0
i do n't think that 's fair			0
‘ let the mps decide or leave it as it is - with what we agreed with the press and the public that it 's independent of @entity91 and that 's where i think it should remain			0
