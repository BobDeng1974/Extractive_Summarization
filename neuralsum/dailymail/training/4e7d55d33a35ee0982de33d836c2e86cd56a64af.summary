@entity0 and @entity1 had spent thousands of dollars to turn a spacious house in @entity3 , into their dream home where they were hoping to raise their children and retire one day			1
but what the @entity8 did not know was that their new house was a former meth den that was now slowly poisoning their entire family , including their pet dog			2
@entity1 and @entity14 used all their savings last year to take out a mortgage on a $ 144,000 two - story house with a porch and an acre of land			1
so in may 2013 the @entity8 proceeded with an extensive makeover			0
but as soon as they moved in , everyone in the house started getting sick , including the couple 's two young daughters and infant son			1
' they were sick every week , ' @entity14 told @entity46			1
' they would wake up			0
have digestive issues and then by noon , one o’clock start to feel better			0
' the mystery malady seemed to be affecting the entire household , and even the family dog eventually had to be euthanized after falling ill with cancer			0
for the @entity8 , one early tell - tale sign was a strange metallic smell that permeated the house and was especially strong in the kitchen			0
sickened : the @entity8 ' three children ( pictured ) , and even the family dog , suffered from vomiting , nausea , difficulty breathing and headaches			2
the pet eventually fell ill with cancer and had to be put down from dream home to house of horrors : a test showed that the first floor , including the baby room , had meth levels 18 times higher than what is considered safe driven out : after learning the awful truth , the family moved out of the remodeled house and into an apartment then in february a neighbor finally shed light on what was happening inside their home : the previous owner had allegedly cooked and used methamphetamine inside			1
mrs @entity14 immediately purchased a meth test kit for $ 50 , and the results confirmed their worst fears			1
the first floor of their house , including the baby room , had meth levels 18 times higher than what is considered safe under the law , and the upstairs bedrooms were three times the legal limit			1
. the @entity8 moved out of their dream home at once and settled in an apartment after discarding most of their belonging for fear of contamination , ‘ it feels like a death happened , to be honest , ’ @entity14 said			2
‘ that ’s how it feels to my husband and i. ’ the process of manufacturing meth involves highly toxic chemicals , which give off noxious fumes that contaminate everything in sight , including carpets and paint on the walls			0
prolonged exposure to methamphetamine particles can cause vomiting , difficulty breathing and headaches			0
@entity1 , a retired @entity118 , said that he , his wife and their three children were constantly out of breath and thought they were having asthma attacks on a nearly daily basis			2
‘ i feel like i put them in harm 's way more so than i ever could have just staying where we were			0
i regret moving so bad , ' the mother of three told @entity131			0
legal action : the @entity8 have filed a lawsuit against their real estate agent , @entity134 ( pictured center ) , claiming that she had to know the truth about the house since it was her own son , @entity138 ( pictured far left ) , who used to own it in order to resell the one - time drug den , the @entity8 have been forced to hire a professional cleaning company to decontaminate the entire house to the tune of $ 10,000 , which they had to pay out of pocket because their insurance company refused to cover the clean - up cost citing ' pollution exclusions ' in their policy			1
the family have now filed a lawsuit against the real estate agent who sold them the property , along with the real estate company , @entity156 , and the former owner , claiming breach of contract			1
according to the @entity8 , realtor @entity134 had to know the seedy history of the house since the person who had lived there before them was her son , @entity162			1
a lawyer for the realtor has vehemently denied any knowledge of meth use or contamination of the property in a statement to @entity46			0
the @entity8 are not alone			0
since 2007 , more than 3,400 dwellings have been identified as meth labs in @entity3 - the highest number in the nation .			2
