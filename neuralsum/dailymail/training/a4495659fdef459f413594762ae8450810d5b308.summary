@entity0 could effectively be thrown out of football over the next few years if they fail to pay an anticipated huge fine for breaking @entity3 financial fair play rules			1
that startling prospect was raised on tuesday by the @entity3 ’s chief executive , @entity6 , as he outlined ‘ nuclear option ’ possibilities of what could happen if @entity0 refuse to pay			1
‘ theoretically , that is the position , ’ @entity6 said			2
‘ i would hope there would be resolution long before that option even had to be considered			2
if they overspend but do n’t go up , they face transfer embargoes			0
if they overspend and do go up - as @entity0 overspent and went up last season - then they face huge fines			2
the tariff system of fines is hugely complex but in the simplest terms , @entity0 face a fine of £ 1 for every £ 1 over £ 18 million that they lost in the 2013 - 14 season			1
@entity0 ’s losses for 2013 - 14 are not yet known			2
they lost £ 65.4m in 2012 - 13 and it is anticipated the figure will be around £ 60m in 2013 - 14 , which could mean a fine of around £ 40m			0
they must let the @entity3 know the exact figure by 1 december			0
@entity0 ’s owner @entity51 has said he will contest any fine , and perhaps even take legal action to try to avoid paying it			1
promotion : @entity57 's goal at @entity58 put @entity0 into the @entity18 last may big money : @entity60 signed for @entity0 from @entity61 on the final day of the transfer window appeal : @entity51 says he will contest any fine that the @entity3 try and make @entity0 pay @entity6 , speaking to @entity64 today at the @entity66 conference in @entity67 , said he expects clubs to pay , and that sanctions up to and including not being allowed to play in the @entity3 would be applicable for non-payment			1
@entity0 would not need to worry about this as long as they stayed in the @entity18			1
but as and when they were relegated at any stage in the future , whether that is next may , or next year or in a few years , they would face effective expulsion from league football because the @entity3 would not let them in			0
‘ theoretically , that is the position , ’ @entity6 said			0
‘ i would hope there would be resolution long before that option even had to be considered			0
the one thing for certain is that most clubs [ in the @entity18 ] will become a @entity3 club again			1
game - changer : promotion meant that the @entity3 could not impose a transfer embargo cost of success : @entity88 led @entity0 back to the @entity18 but broke financial fair play rules ‘ now @entity0 will of course be hoping it does not happen for some considerable number of seasons			1
but the chances they will need to return to the @entity3 fold at some point in the future			0
certainly , three of the current 20 clubs that are in the @entity18 will be in the @entity3 next season			1
’ @entity6 hopes that any clubs needing to pay their fines will do so , @entity0 included			1
he also hopes that if they initially refuse , then football arbitration will be possible ahead of harsher action			0
‘ football has a number of processes to try to keep its debates out of court and inside a tribunal system or arbitration system under the @entity112 ’s guise , ’ @entity6 said			0
‘ ultimately , i believe the @entity112 would have a part to play in terms of determining the outcome between a club and a league in which they are not currently playing			0
’ originally the @entity3 wanted to take any fines levied on rule - breaking clubs and share them between clubs who stayed within the rules			2
the @entity18 objected to that so now any fines will be given to charity .			0

@entity0 broke rules in order to win promotion from *championship* last season
@entity3 could prevent club from playing in their leagues if @entity0 fail to pay a fine of up to £ *40million*
@entity0 would be safe while they stay in the top *flight* , but relegation from the @entity18 would see them *banned*
@entity3 chief executive @entity6 says he hopes there can be a different resolution but admits ' nuclear option ' is possible
owner @entity51 has *pledged* to fight any potential fine
