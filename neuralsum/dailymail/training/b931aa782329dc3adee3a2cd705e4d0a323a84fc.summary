by @entity0 published : 19:30 est , 16 november 2013 updated : 09:11 est , 17 november 2013 action : prince @entity2 has written in the @entity3 today about his initiative to stop a ' lost generation ' of young people prince @entity2 is to mark his 65th birthday with a radical attempt to force the three main party leaders to help him stop a ‘ lost generation ’ of young people drifting into crime and unemployment			1
in a highly unusual move , the @entity2 will be joined this week by @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 to try to recruit a ‘ community army ’ of nearly two million young people			1
the prince regards this as the most important event surrounding his landmark birthday			0
announcing the initiative in today ’s @entity3 , the @entity2 writes that youngsters will be encouraged to take part in a range of activities – from helping the elderly and disabled to joining the scouts or guides and clearing up the countryside			1
in return they may be rewarded with better chances of finding work or getting a promotion			2
the prince wants concrete recognition for those who have served the community , including that they be put to the front in competition for jobs			2
well - placed sources say his @entity45 ( @entity46 ) campaign is the product of years of frustration that policies for the young are changed each time one political party replaces another in government			1
the @entity46 project , which will cost £ 4 million over seven years , is designed to put an end to that through securing the backing of all three leaders of the main parties			1
the costs will be shared between private business , donors and the taxpayer			0
the scheme is also a sign of the @entity2 ’s determination to show he is ready to be an active , engaged monarch when he succeeds the @entity66			2
he has previously been accused of ‘ meddling ’ in political affairs and pressuring ministers to back his causes			0
but by getting the support of all three leaders for @entity46 , he aims to show he is a unifying political force			0
he also hosts the @entity73 in @entity74 this weekend , indicating his intention to play a high - profile role in both domestic and foreign affairs			0
the @entity2 said he hopes @entity46 will reduce the danger that young people join street gangs , and revive the tradition where it was a ‘ rite of passage of youth ’ to be active on behalf of the community			1
to make the scheme work he will call for : celebrations : @entity2 , pictured with his birthday cake , recently turned 65 while on tour in @entity89 the @entity2 says he was moved to act by tragedies such as the brutal killing of 16 - year - old @entity92 in 2008			2
@entity92 bled to death in the arms of his brother @entity95 after @entity92 , then 19 , hurled a @entity97 dish at him in a bakery			0
the dish shattered , severing the arteries in his neck			0
writing in @entity3 , the @entity2 says : ‘ sitting listening to families whose children have been murdered through street violence , i found it impossible to ignore their pleas for help in finding solutions to a problem which has blighted too many lives			2
‘ i often reflect on the bravery and courage of @entity112 and @entity113 [ @entity92 ’s parents ]			0
they are convinced – as i have been for the past 40 years – that part of the solution is in providing more structured activities for young people			1
’ he argues that tragedies such as the murder of @entity92 are ‘ the extreme result of too many young people no longer guided through a rite of passage ’ – a chance to be involved in the community			1
it was the @entity128 , and others like them , who persuaded him to try to find a lasting remedy			0
‘ that is why i am joining the leaders of @entity133 , including @entity15 , @entity17 and @entity16 , together with 50 young people , at @entity135 to launch a pledge campaign ( on @entity137 ) , # iwill , through @entity139			1
family : prince @entity2 meets with @entity112 and @entity113 during a visit to the @entity142 after the death of their son @entity92 ‘ this long - term campaign , supported by all sectors of society and involving faith and political leaders , education , business , trade unions and the voluntary sector , has a unifying vision			1
’ that vision is to increase the number of people aged ten to 20 who take part in community or volunteering activities , raising it from the current estimated 29 per cent to 50 per cent			1
that would mean an extra 1.7 million young recruits			0
he has studied similar schemes in parts of the @entity166 , such as @entity167 , where the figure is already around 50 per cent , and in @entity169 , where it is nearly 60 per cent			0
the @entity2 also wants more older people to step forward to organise activities as , for example , @entity174 and guide leaders			1
he writes : ‘ i have long believed we are failing to do enough to unlock their talent and unleash their energies to help tackle all sorts of challenges in our society			0
they are the solution to so much and yet , too frequently , are seen as the problem			0
‘ all over our country are thousands of lonely old people who need company , younger children who need alternatives to hanging about on the street corner , crucial environmental work that needs doing and local causes that need espousing			2
’ ‘ we must enlist thousands more adults to help support and motivate younger people in their social action and to encourage those who have already been involved to engage and lead others			2
’ ‘ the @entity204 recently reported that employers needed young people who were optimistic , determined and emotionally intelligent – and research shows that young people who take on challenging volunteering activities increase all those character traits and virtues			1
’ the prince sees @entity213 as just as important a venture as his highly praised @entity216 scheme , which has helped 160,000 disadvantaged young people gain job skills			1
information on how to get involved in the community will be available on the @entity46 website .			0
