@entity0 insists @entity2 's title hopes are still alive , despite their disappointing defeat to @entity4			1
@entity2 will fall eight points behind @entity7 leaders @entity8 next week if they follow up their loss to @entity4 with another reverse at @entity11			1
@entity13 's men rarely looked like a team capable of winning the title on sunday , but @entity0 thinks it would be foolish to write his team 's chances off just yet			1
@entity2 defender @entity0 appeals to referee @entity19 after he concedes a penalty in fact , the skipper thinks the result could actually help @entity2 's chances of winning the league as he thinks the players will be even more determined to beat @entity8 in what is already being billed as a ' title decider '			1
' in theory it should be better for us now because we will definitely be more fired up for that ( match ) , ' the @entity2 captain said			2
' we have always been great in games like this so i 'm actually looking forward to it			0
' @entity2 moved level with @entity8 over the @entity40 period but draws against @entity41 and @entity42 have proved costly for @entity13 's side			1
@entity44 was caught by @entity0 with the contact sending the left back crashing to the ground inside the box when asked how damaging the @entity4 defeat could be for @entity2 , @entity0 said : ' you are disappointed with any result that 's not a win , but we 've been in situations like this before and it wo n't affect the way we look at the @entity7 , it wo n't affect the way we look at the @entity60 or the @entity61			1
' we will just make sure we are better the next game			0
we are always liable to kick off a massive run and that 's the kind of club that we are			0
' maybe this run has stopped , but the next one should be coming soon hopefully			0
' @entity66 leads the celebrations after the @entity68 kept his cool to fire home from the penalty spot @entity0 did not put in the kind of display expected of him on his return from a month - long hamstring injury lay - off			1
the @entity76 earned a booking for taking down @entity78 and was lucky to stay on the pitch after a second foul on @entity81 which went unnoticed			0
the former @entity83 defender also gave away the penalty that handed @entity4 the lead , although replays showed there was minimal contact between the centre - back and @entity44			1
there was no doubting his hunger to impress , though , and that bodes well for @entity2 as they look to retain the title in the coming four months			2
@entity0 earned a booking for taking down @entity78 during a difficult evening for the home side ' people who know me see i work like an animal when i am out , ' the 28 - year - old said			1
' i want to be back stronger and i 've come back at the right time as well			0
' @entity0 refused to criticise @entity19 's decision to give a penalty against him for the slightest of touches on @entity104			2
' i 've said my bit on the pitch and i do n't want to go further , ' the @entity76 said			0
we pick ourselves up now			0
that spirit is there , more than ever , in this team			0
' @entity0 hopes new signing @entity113 will have a big impact when he joins the squad after the @entity117			1
@entity0 hopes new signing @entity113 ( above ) will have a big impact when he joins the squad ' i rate him , ' said @entity0 , who flew to @entity121 with his team - mates for a five - day warm - weather training camp after the match			1
' if we are serious about the league and the @entity61 then you need good players like him			2
you ca n't get enough of them			0
' if you look at all the big teams around us , they have the same kind of strike force			0
the teams we are competing with have the same tools and it 's as simple as that			0
' i quite enjoyed facing him ( @entity113 ) in matches , but i will face him in training more now			2

@entity2 went down 2 - 0 to @entity4 at the @entity147 on sunday
