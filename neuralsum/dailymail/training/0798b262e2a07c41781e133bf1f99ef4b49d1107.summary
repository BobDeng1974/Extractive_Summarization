add a 40mph spin and even the bravest thrillseeker may think twice			0
this a ride on the @entity9 , the world ’s tallest chair carousel , opening in @entity12 this weekend			1
standing at a neck - bending 397ft tall , it offers panoramic views of the @entity19 capital - for those brave enough to keep their eyes open			2
riding high : @entity9 , the world 's tallest chair swing carousel is nearly 400ft high and will take you on a 44mph ride - if you dare ! riders squeal in delight as the 12 swings hit the top speed of 44mph at @entity19 ’s oldest theme park @entity29 , located at the heart of the city			1
the amusement park already boasts 30 rides on the 15 - acre site and attracts 1.2million visitors per year – quite a feat in a city with an urban population of just over 1.35million			1
@entity9 has already been given the seal of approval by @entity19 ’s first ( and only ) astronaut , @entity41 , who was its first passenger at the opening ceremony			1
anti gravity : once the swing gets going , brave riders spin through the air at nearly 44mpg @entity47 out - screamed : a @entity49 fan and her friend shout in delight as they enjoy one of the first spins on @entity9 the seats can take two riders each and hang on 8ft chains which are sent in a dizzying spin , high above the rooftops			0
for those who still find this a mundane ride , the panoramic view of @entity12 may be worth a ticket alone			0
if worst comes to worst , the double seats offer a shot at getting close to the locals - last year @entity68 named @entity12 as the city where you find the sexiest men , as well as the second most beautiful women , in the world sky high : when you are 400ft up in @entity9 , the world is , quite literally , at your feet - or at least @entity12 is			2

@entity9 sets a record at 397ft and a top speed of 44mph
opened at @entity19 's oldest amusement park in *central* @entity12
first passenger was @entity19 astronaut @entity41
