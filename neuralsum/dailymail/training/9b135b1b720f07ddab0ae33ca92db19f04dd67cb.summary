a seven - year - old called 999 when her heavily pregnant mother started having life - threatening convulsions - and then had to direct an ambulance driver to the maternity wing			1
mum - of - three @entity5 , 30 , was at 35 weeks when she collapsed and suffered a pre-eclampsic fit at home with daughters @entity8 , seven , and @entity10 , five			1
instead of panicking , cool - headed @entity11 ran into the house , grabbed the phone and called an ambulance - telling the operator that her mother was asleep and would n't wake up			1
she then had to direct the ambulance driver to the maternity unit at @entity21 she carefully followed instructions until the ambulance service arrived and rushed her mother to nearby @entity21 - where she gave birth just three hours later			1
but once they arrived in the hospital grounds , the ambulance driver could n't find the maternity wing , as he was used to going straight to the emergency room			1
so @entity8 , who had been to the department with her mother for scans , stepped up again and directed him to the right building on august 30 last year			1
' @entity11 was giving him directions , telling him ' that way ' and ' round there ' , because she 'd been to appointments with me before , ' said mrs @entity5			1
ambulances outside the @entity21 @entity41 department			1
mrs @entity5 said her daughter @entity8 had to direct the ambulance driver to the maternity unity a map showing the layout of @entity21			1
@entity8 directed the ambulance to the maternity wing after they too her mother to the emergency room ' she really saved the day - my little hero			1
' pre-eclampsia can cause fits and other complications , as well as low birth weight and premature birth for the baby			1
pre-eclampsia is a condition that can develop in pregnant women			1
women with pre-eclampsia have high blood pressure and protein in their urine			2
severe pre-eclampsia can be life - threatening for both mother and baby			1
in the baby it can cause growth problems and a premature birth			2
symptoms include : the severe convulsions , caused by high blood pressure , can be life - threatening for both mother and baby			1
the only cure for pre-eclampsia is for the baby to be born			2
mrs @entity5 gave birth to her third baby girl later that day - and to say thank you for saving her and the baby 's life , she allowed @entity8 and @entity10 to name her - which they did , calling her @entity89			1
she had been watching @entity11 and @entity10 - now aged eight and seven - dressing up as princesses and putting on shows during the hot afternoon last year			2
' i went inside to get them a drink , and that 's the last thing i can remember			0
' putting together what i 've been told , i collapsed onto the grass as i walked back outside with the drinks			2
' @entity8 said she tried to wake me up , but i would n't wake , so she ran inside and grabbed the phone and called 999			1
' ever since my girls were little , i 've always made sure they know what to do in an emergency , what their address is , i made up little songs to sing with @entity11 about our phone number so she could remember it easily			0
' i do n't know why , i think because i work with children , i was always aware that they needed to know what to do in an emergency			0
' so @entity8 rang the operator and told her mummy was asleep and would n't wake up			1
' they explained to @entity11 how to put me into the recovery position , so @entity8 and @entity115 put me onto my left side , raised my head			2
' dr @entity118 , deputy medical director at @entity119 , said : ' @entity5 's children are to be commended for staying calm ' at one point , the operator asked @entity8 to check her mum 's mouth for food or vomit , asking : ' is there anything in her mouth ? ' and she replied : ' just her teeth '			1
the ambulance took around ten or 15 minutes to arrive , and mrs @entity5 woke up as the paramedics walked into the garden			1
' @entity11 and @entity10 were n't upset the whole time they were on the phone , but as soon as i came round , they got upset , ' she said			0
' i think they were just relieved , and i kept asking them if they were ok			0
' it 's a really scary thought that for that period of time , they were just fending for themselves with noone to look after them			0
' mrs @entity5 was told she would need an emergency caeserian to deliver @entity89			2
she arrived safely at 8.15pm - just three hours after @entity8 made the 999 phone call and spent a week in the neo-natal unit while her breathing difficulties were resolved			1
' @entity11 and @entity10 got to meet @entity89 before i did - because i was being treated in a separate ward so could n't see @entity89 for a few days , ' said mrs @entity5			1
' i told them they could name her , because they saved her life - so they called her @entity89 , after @entity89			1
' dr @entity118 , deputy medical director at @entity119 , said : ' @entity5 's children are to be commended for staying calm and doing all the right things when faced with this daunting situation			2
' they carried out the right actions to get help for their @entity163 , did n't panic and did everything asked of them by our telephone adviser in the @entity169 so that immediate care could be provided for @entity5 until the ambulance crew arrived on scene			1
