once - pristine lakes in @entity2 , @entity3 , are now coated by a jello - like layer of slime caused by decades of industrial activity , a new study reveals			1
the scum coating now present on vast bodies of water in the province is due to the rapid growth of a new type of plankton which secretes the unpleasant goo , according to a team of researchers			1
years of industrial activity has eaten away at nutrients around the lakes , killing off species that used to live there and allowing the @entity23 plankton to thrive			1
' @entity24 ' : a researcher holds up a scoop of the jello - like scum produced by a type of plankton which has multiplied rapidly thanks to industrial processes after - effects : a decline in calcium , caused by effects like acid rain , killed off competitors and allowed the scum - producing @entity23 to expand researchers - who pictured themselves scooping gelatinous handfuls of the scum out of the lakes - said they found calcium levels in the earth by the lakes had plummeted in recent decades			1
chemical waste from factories - spread by weather phenomena like acid rain - can eat away at minerals usually present in soil , causing profound changes to the animals and plants that live nearby			1
according to the researchers - a mixture of government scientists and academics from the universities of @entity58 and ottawa - populations of the plankton which produce the substance has doubled since the 1980s			0
it has corresponded with a decline in the calcium levels in surrounding soil , which began with the rise of industry in the 1850s , but picked up significantly in the @entity70			1
their findings were published this month in a journal by the @entity74 , which said the effect could take thousands of years to reverse			2
once - pristine : the jello - like layer is covering lakes in @entity3			1
pictured is a body of water in @entity81 the lakes used to be full of a different species of plankton - called @entity84 - which had lived there for centuries and thrived on the calcium which made its way into the water from surrounding soil			1
the tiny animal needed the calcium to build a thick exo - skeleton that stopped it from getting eaten by midges - but when the deposits started to run out they struggled to survive			0
while populations declined , the @entity23 - which does n't need as much calcium - began to thrive instead			0
their defensive mechanism is to surround themselves with a jello - like scum , which is now spreading over the lake			0
invader : the @entity105 gibberum is producing the ' jelly ' substance as a defense against predators as well as contributing to the ' jellification ' effect , falling calcium levels could have a knock - on effect on public health , as these nutrients can make their way up the food chain into humans			2
the water could also become less safe to use			0
dr @entity120 , a @entity58 plant scientist , said : ' as calcium declines , the increasing concentrations of jelly in the middle of these lakes will reduce energy and nutrient transport right across the food chain , and will likely impede the withdrawal of lake water for residential , municipal and industrial uses			2
' ' in @entity2 , 20 % of government - monitored drinking water systems now come from landscapes containing lakes with depleted calcium concentrations that favour , and this is only set to increase			0
' environment laws have stopped many of the processes which led to the removal of calcium , but the slow - moving effects are still being felt , and could prove difficult to shift			0
@entity120 said : ' pollution control may have stopped acid deposits in the landscape , but it ’s only now that we are discovering the damage was n’t entirely reversed '			0
' it may take thousands of years to return to historic lake water calcium concentrations solely from natural weathering of surrounding watersheds ' .			2

jelly layer in @entity3 lakes expanded in recent years , study found
caused by rapid growth of plankton which secretes the gunk as defense
the species has been thriving in past decades due to rise of industry
factories chemicals *destroy* minerals in soil , causing *ecological* change
*experts* say it could be thousands of years until the *situation* is reversed
