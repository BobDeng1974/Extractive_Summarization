for a generation of women , @entity0 was synonymous with sex , shopping and , above all else , shoes			1
her walk - in wardrobe may have been crammed with designer clothes and handbags , but her skyscraper manolos , louboutins and @entity11 were the real stars of @entity13			2
so it ’s no surprise that @entity16 has designed her own shoe range inspired by her character ’s collection			1
but are they anywhere near as stylish — and are they as agonising to walk in as @entity0 ’s towering shoes looked ? @entity23 puts them to the test ... will @entity27 's ( right ) feet survive the shoes of @entity0 ( left ) ? floral and feminine : @entity16 teaming a floral dress with monochrome shoes on the set of @entity13 the @entity33 , £ 225the look : @entity35 and a very sensible three - and - a - quarter inch heel height			1
the toe has a classy criss - cross effect and the delicate strap fastens with a gold buckle			2
best for : everyday wear			2
so comfortable and lightweight , i barely feel like i ’m wearing anything — it ’s like floating on @entity46 for : rainy days — but apart from that , a winner all round			1
@entity16 shows it can be done ! comfort rating : 5			1
a wardrobe must - have — though the price is a little steep for me			2
high and mighty : @entity16 looks gorgeous with short hair and these fun wedge heels the @entity59 , £ 146the look : red suede espadrilles that make me feel like i ’m wearing fancy dress			1
stylish , chic , sexy			2
these shoes are none of those things			2
even for wedges , these are painfully uncomfortable.worst for : comfort and style			1
they ’re very narrow on the toe			2
not as painful as some , but for such relatively low heels at only three inches , they are awful			2
@entity79 : @entity0 , the character played by @entity16 in @entity13 had a ridiculous amount of shoes - so many she needed a whole wardrobe to house them ! the @entity85 , £ 217the look : very sexy black patent shoes , with a chic tapered @entity88 for : making short legs look lengthy			1
the slanted angle of the strap elongates the leg			0
worst for : all - day wear			0
the super-shiny leather is a little bit stiff , and they ’re easy enough to walk in at three - and - a - half inches — but i would n’t travel for miles in them			0
great height , but that leather gives me blisters just by looking at it			0
pretty in purple : actress @entity16 during filming of ' @entity105 ' , managing to walk in difficult shoes the @entity0 , £ 212the look : a pointy nude t - bar sandal with a sky - high heel			1
best for : a night with minimal movement			0
walking is nigh on @entity112 for : anything that involves standing up too long			0
murderously painful — but since when did that stop @entity0 from stepping out in something so chic ? not so hot : @entity13 character @entity0 ( right ) is outshone by fellow character @entity118 ( left ) in the shoe department in this picture the @entity121 , £ 235the look : clog sandals with four - inch heels and a wooden platform sole			1
best for : walking , thanks to the platform heel			0
perfect for a casual weekend or for someone who wants to add height without reaching for the plasters			0
they ’re just not glamorous enough for @entity0 wannabes			1
but quite boring with it			0
ultra-feminine : @entity16 's pink shoes pick up hints of pink in her coat the @entity141 , £ 270the look : ultra-feminine , with a silk rose detail			1
while they ’re only three - and - a - half inches high , they feel teeteringly uncomfortable , even by @entity0 ’s standards			1
i put this down to the thin sole			0
oh , for a comfy platform sole ! best for : looking at			0
i ca n’t even wear them sitting @entity155 for : getting blisters			0
the sharp toe means they pinch and rub like crazy			0
@entity160 - hide feet only need apply			0
colour pop : @entity16 as @entity0 shows that a fantastic pair of shoes can make any outfit glam @entity165 , £ 209the look : as red as @entity169 ’s ruby slippers in @entity170 , these are super-sexy heels			1
i ’m amazed by how comfortable they are , hugging my foot like a @entity174 they might be three - and - a - half inches high , but the slightly sturdier heel makes them easier to balance in than other shoes in the range			1
best for : any occasion — as long as you can handle the attention ! worst for : nothing			0
they ’re a complete @entity187 rating : 5			0
the @entity16 collection is available from @entity189 ( international shipping and import duties apply ) .			1

@entity16 has designed shoe range inspired by @entity0 ’s *enormous* shoe collection
@entity196 tests them for style and comfort
