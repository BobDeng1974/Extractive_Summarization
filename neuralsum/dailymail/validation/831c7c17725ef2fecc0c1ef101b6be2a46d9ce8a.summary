@entity20 , 24 , of @entity44 , @entity1 met with one final @entity73 in may 2010 before she disappeared for good
police searched for over a year for the sex worker 's body and in doing so *uncovered* a mass grave for some 10 other slain prostitutes 3 miles away
@entity60 's mother and some *experts* believe her death came at the hands of @entity8 's *elusive* @entity150 killer
however , police *disagree* and saw @entity60 died after fleeing the home of her last customer and possibly drowning in a nearby marsh
