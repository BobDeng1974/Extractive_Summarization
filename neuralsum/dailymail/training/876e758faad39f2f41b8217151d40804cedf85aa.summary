by @entity0 published : 23:36 est , 1 may 2013 updated : 02:59 est , 2 may 2013 secondary schools should prepare children for adulthood by focusing on pornography , sex abuse and homosexuality , the schools watchdog has said			1
too much time is being spent on the ‘ mechanics ’ of reproduction and not on ‘ controversial issues ’ , according to @entity12			1
children are being left at risk of exploitation and inappropriate behaviour because they are learning about contraception , pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases but not ‘ sexual content and the influence of pornography ’			2
secondary schools should do more to prepare children for adult life by focusing on pornography , sex abuse and homosexuality , according to @entity12 ( file picture ) two - fifths of schools are failing to provide pupils with the information they need in personal , social , health and economic education classes , inspectors said in a report			1
the comments follow an announcement last week by the @entity38 , which represents dozens of charities including the @entity40 , that @entity42 lessons should be used to tell children ‘ not all pornography is bad ’			0
@entity12 ’s report said : ‘ in secondary schools ... too much emphasis was placed on “ the mechanics ” of reproduction and too little on relationships , sexuality , the influence of pornography on students ’ understanding of healthy sexual relationships , dealing with emotions and staying safe			1
’ it continued : ‘ the failure to include discussion of pornography is concerning as research shows that children as young as nine are increasingly accessing pornographic internet sites			0
’ @entity64 , it added , complained lessons steered clear of controversial topics such as sexual abuse , pornography and homosexuality			0
primary schools were also criticised for placing ‘ too much emphasis on friendships and relationships , leaving pupils ill - prepared for physical and emotional changes during puberty			1
’ education minister @entity76 confirmed in march that @entity42 would not become compulsory secondary schools emphasised the ' mechanics ' of reproduction too much , the report said fifty schools were inspected and 178 young people questioned for the report , which said @entity42 classes required improvement or were inadequate in 40 per cent of schools			1
‘ lack of high - quality , age - appropriate sex and relationships education ... is a concern as it may leave children and young people vulnerable to inappropriate sexual behaviours and sexual exploitation , ’ it added			2
‘ this is because they have not been taught the appropriate language or developed the confidence to describe unwanted behaviours or know where to go for help			0
’ education minister @entity76 confirmed in march that @entity42 would not become a compulsory subject , saying schools and teachers should decide what subjects were covered in lessons			2
@entity107 , of the @entity108 , yesterday accused @entity12 of assuming ‘ sex education holds the answer to the sexual exploitation of young people ’			2
he said : ‘ sex education that provides children with a menu of sexual options , tells them that there are no moral absolutes in the area of sexual expression , and presents contraceptive use as the mark of sexual responsibility is part of the problem , not the solution			0
‘ as for @entity12 ’s advocacy of classroom discussions about pornography from an early age ... it would introduce the concept of pornography to many children who had not encountered it before and arouse in some a curiosity to search out more pornographic material for themselves			1
‘ most parents would far rather the government introduce an opt - in system to limit the risk of their children accessing sexual images online in the first place than add pornography to the school curriculum			0
’ the @entity147 , formerly the @entity148 , said sex education classes should be compulsory but called on parents to play a more active role in informing their children			0
a @entity153 spokeswoman said : ‘ our curriculum reforms have given teachers the freedom to tailor their teaching so it meets the needs of their pupils			0

@entity12 said too much time is spent on subject of reproduction
wants to see more time devoted to relationships and sexuality
primary schools also criticised for not preparing children for puberty
