’ however , thanks to a lot of physiotherapy , ms @entity1 was able to regain her independence one movement at a time			2
within three weeks she was able to move both her arms a few centimetres , and six weeks after she was paralysed she stood up for a few seconds with the help of three nurses			2
she said : ‘ people were saying , “ bend your legs , straighten your back , tuck you tummy in , ” but it was so strange as i just had no idea how to do it			2
‘ the first time i was able to move for five seconds i remember just yelling and everyone started applauding			0
