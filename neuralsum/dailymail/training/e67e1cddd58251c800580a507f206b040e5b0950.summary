when a beautiful fashion designer embarked on a crazy year of one - night stands , the last person she expected to meet was the man of her dreams			1
devastated by the end of a ten - year romance , @entity6 @entity5 , 37 , picked up men in bars , turned into a bunny boiler when an ill - fated fling with her boss went wrong and had sex with a fireman who could n't string a sentence together outside the bedroom			1
then she got drunk at a cousin 's wedding , broke every rule in the dating - for - keeps book and embarked on what she assumed would be nothing more than a dirty weekend			1
breaking every rule in the book : @entity5 , 37 , from @entity6 , charts every embarrassing detail of her year of one - night - stands in her new memoir , on my knees it turned out she 'd met her future husband			1
and today @entity5 - who looks like @entity34 minus the tattoos - still ca n't quite believe she hooked mr @entity36 by doing everything wrong			1
' i 'm a total believer in one - night stands , ' she says , waving her hilarious memoir @entity39 about as she tells the stories she documented during her year of living dangerously			1
' girls today are given all sorts of ridiculous advice on dating			1
you are n't supposed to sleep with someone until you 've had five dates or whatever			1
it 's outdated and contrived			1
' i say sleep with anyone you want , when you want			1
now i 'm not advocating that you go off with a serial killer - you should always text a friend and take photos on your phone of the guy 's address - but you should be able to have fun			2
' not that @entity5 's one - night stands were always fun – in fact some were down right sickening			1
illegally squatting in her dead grandmother 's flat , many of her encounters happened on a pink sofa that her gran had covered in plastic covers to keep clean			2
' i 'm a total believer in one - night stands			2
girls today are given all sorts of ridiculous advice on dating			1
it 's outdated and contrived ' but it was n't so much the squelching sounds from the sofa that grossed her out			1
it was usually the men			2
' there was a bite - your - arm - off ugly @entity83 – the hairiest man i have ever encountered , ' she says , describing her horror at the fat man she drunkenly dragged home from one bar			2
' @entity91 was covered in coarse , pubic - like hair			2
he looked like a fat horse			2
if that was n't bad enough , he also smelled like a barnyard animal , ' she says			2
when @entity5 pushed him away , he took off his underpants and started pleasuring himself			1
@entity5 ran off to the bathroom in disgust			1
when she returned , @entity91 had passed out naked on the floor and was snoring loudly			2
' i kicked him awake and threw him out			2
i thought that encounter was my lowest point			2
' but then i decided to really self - destruct – by sleeping with my best male friend @entity105 , a man who was also technically my boss			2
' he owned an advertising agency with offices in @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112			2
he convinced me to do some freelance consulting			2
' true love : @entity5 reveals how she met her now - husband , @entity116 , when she got drunk at a cousin 's wedding and embarked on what she assumed would be nothing more than a dirty weekend they started having sex shortly after @entity5 's long - time romance ended – and everything instantly went wrong			1
' he just wanted to have a good time			2
@entity128 , being in a dark depression , was looking for someone to save me			2
' @entity5 says she turned from fun friend - with - benefits to a needy screaming harridan			1
@entity105 made it clear that the last thing he wanted to be was to be @entity5 's boyfriend			1
but she ignored every warning sign and threw herself into what was a non-existent romance			0
' i was pathetic , ' she says , explaining how she went ' psycho ' for no logical reason when he told her friends were joining them for dinner			0
' after reading my book , my mother told me she felt like she needed to wear a burkha to leave the house ' most women would find it hard to admit that sort of behaviour to even their best female friends			1
the fact that @entity5 has charted every cough and spit in her new memoir is surprising			1
' after reading my book , my mother told me she felt like she needed to wear a burkha to leave the house , ' she says			0
' my uncle read the sex stuff and he screeched , " on your grandmother 's couch , have you no shame ? " ' one of the oddest bits of the book is a strangely un-erotic encounter with elderly @entity169 author @entity168 , who fed her cherries as he peered down at her chest			0
' my mother had read every single one of his novels , which is probably why i had n't			0
it was only after the encounter that i picked up his books and kicked myself for not trying to sleep with him , ' she says			1
but she had no qualms about bedding a trainee fireman , who had a broken ankle			0
' he was a kid , maybe 24 , with a gold chain and a slick body covered in tattoos , ' says @entity5			1
' we actually slept together a few times but he was n't the brightest bulb in the pack			0
' the sex was good – despite the broken ankle – but we did n't have a lot to say outside the bedroom			0
telling all : @entity5 has charted every cringeworthy detail of her one - night - stands in her new memoir ' i had a fling with a @entity198 guy – and i was dumb struck because i just wanted to listen to his accent			1
' he was such a smooth - talker and really courted me			0
it was hard to take him seriously though , when he gave me compliments , because i was so wrapped up in his voice			0
' @entity5 had given up on finding the perfect man when she flew to @entity207 for a cousin 's wedding			1
' i was n't expecting to meet my future husband there , ' she says			0
' @entity116 apparently spotted me sitting on the floor drunk with food smeared all over my face			0
' i was so out of it i did n't even notice him			0
but the following day he came to my aunt and uncle 's home and it was like boom , an - out - of - body experience			0
he was the most beautiful man i had ever seen			0
' but the course of true love hardly ran smoothly			0
they went to a bar with friends and she was so frustrated that @entity116 did n't seem interested that she carted another man outside and snogged him for 30 minutes			0
this man in his gold chain and wife beater shirt seemed hot in a cheesy sort of way but outside under the street lights i sobered up and realized how ridiculous it was , ' she says			0
' i could try and make this sound better than it actually was but if i 'm really going to be honest , i had just made out with a character out of a @entity242 skit			0
' upon realizing this dreadful error and having no interest in repeating my ordeal with the masturbating @entity83 , i got the hell out of there			0
' @entity116 , an internet marketing executive , had disappeared but re-appeared at her cousin 's home the next day and invited her to dinner at his apartment			0
@entity5 says she expected sex and was stunned when he dished up a home - cooked ten - course meal			1
but when she finally got him into bed , she says their love making blew her mind			0
' i still thought of it as a one - night stand yet i broke all my own rules - i slept the night there with him , rather than disappearing			0
then the next day and the next day … ' ' i still thought of it as a one - night stand yet i broke all my own rules - i slept the night there with him , rather than disappearing			0
then the next day and the next day … ' three years ago , they tied the knot and now the couple have just welcomed their first child - a baby boy named @entity271			0
@entity5 admits that she never expected to meet her future husband while doing her best to sleep with him			1
' i had no expectations when i met @entity116 , so i just acted like myself , ' she says			0
' everything you ever read about the rules of a first date – do n't get drunk , do n't sleep with someone immediately – went out of the window			1
' @entity5 became an accidental feminist clothes designer during president @entity282 's @entity281 years when she walked into a @entity284 boutique wearing a t - shirt she 'd designed saying ' the only bush i trust is my own			1
' the shop owner asked her to print more and her business body as @entity289 took off			0
t - shirts bearing the words ' marriage is so gay ' and ' does date rape mean i also get dinner ? ' became massive hits			0
today she 's the creative designer of an online boutique called @entity297 and to promote her memoir she 'd had bags made up carrying the words : ' can a book be better than a blow job ? ' it is a question she 's not sure she can answer but she has certainly given two fingers to all the dating advocates who advise being cautious when it comes to casual sex			1
' i found my future husband during a drunken one - night stand			0
and if i can do it , so can anyone else , ' she adds defiantly			0
