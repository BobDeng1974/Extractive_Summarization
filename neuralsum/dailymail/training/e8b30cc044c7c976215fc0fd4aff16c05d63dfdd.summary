by @entity0 use - by and sell - by dates have been heavily criticised for being inaccurate , especially when it comes to meat - resulting in tonnes of food being thrown away unnecessarily			0
to solve this problem of wastage , a more accurate method has been devised by a student from @entity9 that uses food labels filled with gelatine			1
the @entity14 label is smooth to the touch to begin with , but as the food inside the packaging decays , the label becomes bumpy			1
it contains gelatine set over a plastic sheet and as the food begins to decay , so does the gelatine			1
when the gelatine decays it revels a bumpy layer			2
the smoother the gelatine , the safer the food is to eat this means all anyone , including blind people , can quickly identify when food is safe to eat , and when it should be thrown away			1
the @entity14 label is filled with gelatine , set over a bumpy plastic sheet ( pictured ) the @entity14 label is filled with gelatine , set over a bumpy plastic sheet			1
because jelly is solid when it sets , the bumps can not be felt at first , but as the gelatine decays , it becomes a liquid			1
this means that the bumps underneath the plastic sheet can be felt , letting users know it has expired			1
@entity47 is protein , so it decays at the same rate as protein - based foods			0
the label simply copies what the food in the package is doing , so the expiry information is said to be far more accurate than a printed date			2
designer @entity59 is currently in discussions with retailers and technology development companies to sell the label , and has a patent pending for the design			0
@entity14 was invented for the @entity22 by @entity68 student @entity20 from @entity9 's @entity69			1
‘ using gelatine to model the decay process of food , @entity14 is able to tell you exactly the condition your food is in , simply by running your finger over the label , ’ explained @entity70			1
‘ if it ’s smooth , then you ’re good to go , but if you start to feels bumps as the gelatine breaks down , be cautious			2
’ earlier this month , the @entity84 food report stated 40 per cent of all the food produced in the @entity86 is never eaten , and in @entity88 , residents throw away 100 million tonnes of food every year			0
part of the issue was blamed on bad shopping habits and throwing away food even when it ’s safe to eat			2

this means all users , including blind people , can quickly identify when food is safe to eat , and when it should be thrown away ‘ i wanted to create a solution for enabling visually impaired consumers to gain expiry information about their food , as currently the only indication is a printed date , ’ continued @entity70			2
‘ from the start , i knew that the solution must appeal to sighted people also , because the sad reality is that new solutions only get implemented by companies if the benefits are useful to the majority			0
‘ this is why i worked to create a cheap solution that could be applied to existing food packages and also provides information that even sighted people have n't had access to before : information about the actual condition of food			2
’ the label design went through more than 20 iterations , each of which were tested for user perception and technical performance			0

@entity47 is solid when it sets , meaning the bumps can not be felt at first , but as the gelatine decays , it becomes a liquid			1
this means that the bumps underneath the plastic sheet can be felt , letting users know it has expired the technology is similar to patches unveiled earlier this year			1
these patches ( pictured ) contain gel that starts out red but changes colour over time , as its ingredients react with each other			0
the rate of the colour change corresponds with the speed of growth of the food poisoning bug e coli at different temperatures @entity70 is currently in discussions with retailers and technology development companies to sell the label , and has a patent pending for the design			0
her design recently won the @entity189 , awarded by made in @entity190 and sponsored by @entity191			0
@entity70 was previously winner of the @entity193 scholarship at @entity69			0
the national winners of the @entity195 will be announced on 18 september			0
it is open to any university - level student of product design , industrial design or engineering studying across @entity88 , @entity201 , @entity202 , @entity203 , @entity204 , @entity205 and the @entity86			0
other finalists include a plant - powered radio and a rotating bed called @entity209 .			0

the @entity14 label was designed by @entity9 student @entity20
it contains a layer of gelatine over a bumpy plastic sheet
when the gelatine is solid , the bumps ca n't be felt when touched
but as the food begins to decay , so does the gelatine and it becomes a liquid
this means the bumpy surface beneath the label is revealed
the smoother the gelatine in the label , the safer the food is to eat
