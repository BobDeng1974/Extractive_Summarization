everyone loves a brand new pair of jeans but wearing them in can be a pain - literally			1
now a @entity6 denim brand has come up with an innovative solution			1
' @entity9 ' denim brand @entity8 , which is based in @entity10 in west @entity6 , employs 50 ' denim breakers ' who wear each pair of jeans for six months before they are sold			1
the first batch of pre-worn jeans , all of which have been thoroughly washed , are to be auctioned off today but more will follow should the venture prove a success			1
the environmentally - friendly distressing method is the brainchild of @entity34 , who , with his wife @entity35 , founded the company in 2011			2
' the idea is that they [ the breakers ] wear them in for us and then we sell them on , ' explained mr @entity34 , in an interview with the @entity45 newspaper			0
' we ’ve just about got them all back			0
we ’re washing them – well , a guy who has been washing jeans for 30 years is – and we ’ll auction them off			2
' the idea is that you break the denim in for the customer			2
it ’s an experiment but so far , so good			0
' looking good : the six - month wearing - in process results in soft , fashionably distressed denim eco-friendly : @entity25 's denim is all raw which means it is n't washed during the manufacturing process fashionable : distressed denim is currently in vogue but making it can be disastrous for the environment @entity25 is one of a growing number of companies specialising in ' raw ' denim which , unlike the regular version , is not washed during the manufacturing process			1
this reduces the amount of potentially poisonous dye running off into local rivers - something that has proved an environmental disaster in @entity76 and @entity77 where the majority of high street jeans are made			1
making the problem worse is the vogue for fashionably ' distressed ' denim which is usually created via a combination of chemicals and machinery			1
mr @entity34 's method , as well as providing jobs for 50 locals , dispenses with all that			0
' good raw jeans , when you get them , are like wearing cardboard , ' says denim breaker @entity93 , 24			2
' luckily , they wash them first [ before they are sold ]			0
if you wear something every day , it will smell			0
by wearing them i ’m adding value to them			0
' eco-friendly distressed denim does , however , come at a price			2
basic men 's jeans start at £ 130 for a plain organic cotton pair , while those made from tough selvage cost £ 230			1
women 's jeans , which are currently only available in skinny fit , cost £ 124.99			1
despite the expense , mr @entity34 , whose factory replaced the old @entity117 denim workshop which used to be one of the main employers in @entity10 , says that his method of making jeans is much better for everyone			1
' in the old factory , they used to wash denim in the river , ' he explains			0
' the waters ran blue which , of course , was n’t good , for the wild salmon and seals especially			0
' 80 per cent of the environmental impact of jeans come from washing and ironing			0

@entity25 is a @entity6 denim brand based in @entity10 in west @entity6
eco-friendly jeans are worn for six months before being sold
jeans made from selvage are ' like cardboard ' when first made
once worn in , they are soft , comfortable and fashionably distressed
