by @entity0 and @entity1 the sun has been shining on the muddy fields of @entity4 as festival revellers enjoyed a final day of music and debauchery at @entity8			1
country queen @entity9 wore the crown during the famous ' sunday afternoon legend 's slot ' as she took to the pyramid stage at 4pm			1
but behind the scenes at @entity8 , it is a slightly different story , where volunteers are wading through mountains of rubbish bags fit to burst , already up to their necks in the clean - up in a bid to protect the fields from yet more damage			1
transformed into a mudbath by day one , the plains took a battering last night as crowds descended from their camp sites for @entity50 's explosive set			2
it followed performances from @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56			0
after last night 's heavy metal , the next act to grace the venue were dancers from the @entity61 this morning , ahead of @entity9 's set on the @entity8 at 4pm , commonly known as the ' sunday afternoon legend 's slot '			1
excitement had been building ahead of the @entity67 's performance , with a flash mob or ' @entity9 mob ' as it has been called , planned for the morning along with a @entity70			1
the rubbish is deep but spirits are high : excitement was brewing on @entity4 in @entity40 this morning ahead of @entity9 's set on the @entity8 @entity76 task : the six - week clean - up will require the help of thousands as the @entity80 family , who run the farm , aim to separate all recyclable goods from waste many fans were paying homage to the star today with specially - made t - shirts and fancy dress outfits			1
speaking ahead of her set , the @entity67 singer said : ‘ i 'm just a country girl and now i feel like a rock star			2
' @entity9 was speaking as she was presented with an award backstage at the festival in recognition of her having sold 100 million records worldwide			1
@entity9 said she planned to play some of her more upbeat tracks from her extensive back catalogue			1
‘ i ca n't do a bunch of sad songs because everyone is drunk and high , ’ she added			0
@entity9 said was ‘ excited ’ about playing the festival and could not believe she had never appeared before			1
as promised , @entity9 appeared in white , dressed in a skintight jumpsuit and huge heels , saying previously that the colour went well with the brown mud			1
woops ! @entity107 , 21 , who travelled over from @entity108 in @entity109 for the event , took a tumble in the mud , falling flat on her face @entity115 - style celebrations : that is going to be an effort to clean later as the sun is starting to dry the mud - but @entity107 seems more than content continuing like this @entity121 : the once - green fields have been battered by torrential rain and the trampling of 175,000 revellers , transforming it into a mud bath swamped : festival - goers are today hoping for sunnier skies and less rain after days of relentless wind and showers that have swamped the grounds binned : thankfully the sun is out as these mud - caked umbrellas are completely destroyed			1
this poor reveller seems to be heading home just as the weather perks up murky : three girls walk across what was once a luscious green field			0
forecasters said the dry weeks before the rain made the mud situation even worse as the crowd cheered , she told them : ‘ thank you so much			2
it is such an honour and such a thrill to be here at @entity8			2
‘ i 've been waiting a lifetime for this and of course we want all of you to have the best time			0
‘ i know you 're here to see a whole load of artists at the festival and we 're just glad that you came to see me			0
’ the 68 - year - old star has been the most talked about act of the festival , following other artists including @entity166 , @entity167 and @entity168			0
@entity170 will headline the stage later while other acts sure to make sure @entity8 goes out with a bang include the @entity174 , @entity175 and @entity176			2
legend : country singer @entity9 took to the @entity8 in a white sequined number for the so - called sunday afternoon legend slot @entity9 mob : bounding around the stage , she belted out hits including @entity67 and 9 - 5 as people in the crowds wearing @entity9 wigs performed a flash mob queen of glam : @entity9 entertained the crowd with her greatest hits , including @entity67 and 9 to 5 @entity192 : the crowd packed themselves to watch the 68 - year - old , one of the most talked about acts of the @entity8 having a @entity9 good time ! two fans dressed up as @entity9 ahead of the concert at the @entity8 on sunday afternoon cheeky : the 68 - year - old @entity67 singer said she would not be singing her sad songs such as @entity204 , ' because everyone is drunk and high ' @entity207 choice : ahead of her performance @entity9 said she had chosen the white outfit as it would go well with the brown mud after two days of stop - start showers , many festival - goers will be hoping for a drier finale as previously promised			1
temperatures are set to reach @entity216 , with cloudy skies but only a very slim chance of rain			0
incredibly , the bookies are already looking ahead to next year 's festival and make it long odds - on at 1/3 tickets sell out faster than they ever have before			0
and looking ahead to potential headliners it 's @entity228 ( 5/1 ) who lead the way to take to the @entity8 , @entity225 is also fancied at 8/1 or it 's a 10/1 shot @entity232 gets the bug for performing again following her temporary residency at @entity235 this year			1
@entity240 could headline for the third time at odds of 10/1 or @entity239 could finally take to the stage at 12/1			0
however , the good news is that @entity38 is unlikely to be filled with @entity244 fans next year with their beloved one direction chalked up as 100/1 outsiders			0
ready for the stage : dancers of the @entity61 prepare backstage prior to performing the @entity8 on sunday unusual : kicking off the final day , the @entity61 made its @entity8 debut with @entity250 by @entity251 , warming the @entity8 for @entity9 worn and torn : untouched pastures at the top of this aerial shot show just how much the fields , dotted with a swarm of multi-coloured tents , have been tarnished @entity258 of @entity259 said : ' the rain might have tried to dampen spirits this year but it certainly wo n't stop festival goers from purchasing tickets in record time for 2015			1
' she added : ' it 's quickly becoming a case of when and not if @entity228 headline			0
@entity80 likes to push the boundaries and we reckon @entity225 and @entity270 will be rocking up to @entity4 next year			2
' the festivities were tinged with drama last night as it emerged woman has been airlifted to hospital from the site after suffering spinal injuries			0
the reveller , who has not been named , was taken to @entity279 , in @entity280 , at around 5pm			0
it is unknown how she came about her injuries but @entity283 and @entity284 confirmed the woman needed off - site attention			0
it is not thought a 999 call was made and instead the festival 's medical services were the first to treat her before calling for help from the @entity284 , on saturday			0
colour popping : @entity56 ( left ) and @entity294 ( right ) have both gone for colourful tie dye for the final day when @entity9 will perform class act : lady @entity297 ( left ) added a touch of glamour to her muddy boots with a fur shawl , while @entity302 kept it casual in a t - shirt and denim shorts stylish stars : @entity307 and @entity308 both wore ankle - height hunter wellies as they strolled over the drying mud			2
