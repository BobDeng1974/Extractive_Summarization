job done ! it was n’t a classic performance but six tries and a 30 - point winning margin is what i was hoping for and @entity7 just about delivered against an @entity9 team that ‘ turned up ’ and made life difficult at times			1
certainly compared with their scrappy 18 - 11 win over @entity9 two seasons ago this was an improvement @entity15 now to move on very quickly because @entity7 will need to find another level of precision altogether if they are to beat @entity18 in @entity19 , which looks like being the pivotal game in this year ’s @entity21			1
the good was there for all to see from @entity7			1
@entity24 is on fire , has the confidence to try things from long range and was very good value for his two tries and rightly takes man - of - the - match honours			1
@entity7 head coach @entity32 congratulates @entity24 ( left ) on his man of the match display @entity24 scored two tries as @entity7 run riot in the second half against @entity9 to win 47 - 17 @entity24 ( right ) is congratulated after scoring his second try of the game in a man of the match performance @entity24 : the @entity43 man is in form , so much so that he took the reorganising of the @entity7 back line in his stride , whereas a year ago that might have fazed him			1
his first try for @entity7 was a big moment , settling the side ’s nerves at a key time			1
ok , @entity9 ’s tackling was n’t fantastic but @entity24 can be a hard man to lay a hand on when he is in this mood			1
his second try underlined his understanding with @entity59 , who put him into space at speed			0
after that it was just a sprint for home			0
@entity65 built on his excellent performance in @entity67 and not only continues to look good in attack but made some very good tackles in the second half			0
these two are nailed on now in this developing @entity7 back line			2
@entity59 ticked over nicely but it was also well worthwhile giving @entity73 some game time			0
big - match player that he is , @entity73 took less than a minute to ghost in for a try and looked almost apologetic after he touched down as if he did n’t want to gatecrash the party and upset anybody			2
he should n’t worry on that score			0
he worked hard for that try			0
he saw something was on down the left , found @entity87 may early with the pass and then showed good pace and anticipation to track may along the touchline and take up the perfect position for the return pass			0
it was a deceptively difficult and classy try and he will feel much more part of things after that			0
i suspect @entity98 will also have enjoyed his rumble over for a try as well and he definitely made an impact when coming on			0
@entity65 ( centre ) has another fine game for @entity7 on the wing as they beat @entity9 @entity73 came off the bench in the second half and made an immediate impact by scoring a try there were some passages of play i did n’t enjoy quite so much , though			1
@entity7 are developing a bad habit of getting out of the blocks slowly and their approach was altogether too sloppy in the first five minutes			2
they passed the ball along the line without any intent instead of hoofing down the pitch and they coughed up a turnover at their first line - out which put @entity9 on the attack and led eventually to the @entity121 ’ early try			1
their rearrangement after @entity124 ’s injury confused me a little , although it did seem to settle down in the second half			0
the obvious thing to do was bring on @entity73 at full back or move @entity65 to full back and ask @entity73 or @entity128 to play on the wing			0
instead , what seemed to happen is that @entity65 moved to full back , @entity128 went to 12 , @entity130 went to 13 and @entity24 found himself on the wing			2
what @entity7 effectively ended up doing was making four changes when they could have rejigged after the injury with just one or two			2
@entity7 's @entity124 ( left ) was knocked out after a crushing collision with @entity137 @entity124 ( left ) is smashed to the ground following the collision as the @entity7 full back was left unconscious medics tend to @entity124 ( centre ) after the collision and there was a long break in play @entity124 left the field on a stretcher and was given oxygen but he was up and about for the second - half			1

@entity7 *thrashed* @entity9 47 - 17 in *saturday* 's @entity21 encounter
@entity24 scored two tries in the hosts ' *victory* at @entity157
@entity7 travel to @entity18 in their next *fixture* on march 1
