when @entity1 was diagnosed with leukaemia , she hoped that the best of medical science would be used to cure it			1
what she could never have anticipated was that her life would be saved by an 18 - year - old boy from a remote @entity10 village			0
@entity1 ’s only chance of survival was a stem cell transplant — previously known as a bone marrow transplant			1
‘ what @entity15 has done is amazing — it really is a gift of life			0
if i had n’t had the transplant , it was unlikely i ’d have lived beyond three months , ' said @entity1 of her donor @entity23 this would give her a new , stronger immune system to destroy the cancerous cells in her blood			1
no one in her family matched her tissue type , so doctors searched the worldwide donor register — and found @entity23 , a student from @entity33 , near the @entity35 border			1
he had recently registered as a stem cell donor , and was the perfect match			1
thanks to @entity15 , @entity1 has made a full recovery			1
the two began writing to each other a year after the transplant and recently met for the first time when @entity15 flew from @entity10 to see @entity1			1
‘ what @entity15 has done is amazing — it really is a gift of life , ’ says @entity1 , who broke down in tears when he walked into the room			1
‘ if i had n’t had the transplant , it was unlikely i ’d have lived beyond three months			2
’ @entity1 ’s husband @entity54 , her son @entity52 and daughter - in - law @entity53 were all there to show their enormous gratitude			1
‘ what ’s remarkable is for a young guy like this to have the social awareness to do something like that , ’ says @entity54			2
for @entity15 the reward is seeing @entity1 in good health			1
‘ she looks so well and so happy , ’ he says			2
‘ it ’s a good feeling			0
’ the story behind his decision to donate is extraordinary			2
in 2011 , a man in his village was diagnosed with leukaemia and needed a stem cell transplant			1
‘ half the village — about 300 people — got checked to see if they were a match and one was found , ’ says @entity15 , now 21 and studying engineering			1
‘ i registered and though i was n’t a match , three months later i got a letter saying there was another person who needed my cells			0
‘ i was told it was a lady from @entity88			0
i was happy to help , ’ he says			2
@entity1 , 74 , was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia ( @entity90 ) — aggressive cancer of the white blood cells — in july 2011 after a blood test showed up abnormalities			1
about 2,600 people in @entity96 are diagnosed with this form of leukaemia each year			2
it ’s most common in the over 60s			0
‘ she looks so well and so happy			0
it ’s a good feeling , ' said @entity15 ‘ the diagnosis was a huge shock , ’ says @entity1 , who lives in @entity103 and has two children , @entity105 and @entity52 , and three grandchildren			1
‘ i wanted to know if i was going to die and my doctor said : “ do not go and @entity110 this			0
” to this day i have never looked			0
’ she adds : ‘ initially , i did cry , but soon i thought : “ i ’ve got to get a grip on this			2
” i never asked about my prognosis			0
i had complete confidence in the wonderful doctors and nurses			2
' it ’s only since the transplant that i ’ve realised how close to death i was			2
’ @entity1 began two courses of chemotherapy , each involving a five - week hospital stay			1
her doctor explained that while they could control her cancer with chemotherapy , the only cure was the transplant			2
stem cells are ‘ master ’ cells that can develop into a variety of different cells — those in the bone marrow turn into blood cells			1
these play a crucial role in the immune system , and in leukaemia , all these cells become abnormal , says dr @entity145 , consultant haematologist at the @entity146 and the @entity147 , who treated @entity1			1
‘ chemotherapy can reduce the cancer , but it ca n’t destroy it completely			0
in a stem cell transplant , cells travel to the centre of the bones and start making new blood cells able to fight the cancer that ’s left over from the chemo			1
’ essentially , the patient ’s blood and immune system is replaced by the donor ’s			1
during @entity1 ’s second course of chemotherapy , she was told a donor had been found			1
‘ i was just told it was a young @entity10 boy of 18 and that was a bit of a strange thought , ’ says @entity1 , who works for her husband , a motivational speaker and performance coach in business and sport			1
about 2,000 people in @entity96 need a stem cell transplant for leukaemia and lymphoma — cancers of the blood — and other blood disorders , such as sickle cell anaemia			1
often , it is their last hope of survival			2
patients can receive a stem cell transplant only from someone who matches their tissue type or else the body rejects it , says dr @entity145			1
‘ there are 22 million volunteers in the world and , for every patient , there are usually just one or two donors who match and sometimes none , ’ he says			0
around a million @entity96 are registered as stem cell donors , but there ’s a desperate need for more			1
only 60 per cent of patients in need of a transplant find the best possible match , according to the charity @entity203			0
there is a particular shortage of young , male donors and those of ethnic minority			0
' it ’s only since the transplant that i ’ve realised how close to death i was , ’ said @entity1 it ’s possible to perform a stem cell transplant using a donor who is a less - than - perfect match , but the risks of rejection are higher			1
stem cells used to be collected via a needle into the bone marrow , an operation involving a general anaesthetic , which caused considerable pain for days afterwards			0
now they can be taken from the blood without an anaesthetic			0
before donating his cells @entity15 had to inject himself in the stomach twice a day for three days with a drug that stimulates stem cells to come out from the bone marrow and into the blood			0
‘ it did n’t hurt , but it ’s uncomfortable when you feel the stem cells coming out — like a pressure in my chest and back , ’ he says			1
he then travelled to a hospital in @entity243 to have cells harvested during a three - hour procedure			0
blood was removed via a tube into his arm and into a machine , which removed the stem cells before the blood was returned to a tube in his other arm			0
about ten to 15 litres of blood were removed , then returned			0
@entity15 says it was painless , and while some donors feel very tired afterwards , he felt fine			0
his cells were flown straight to @entity103 — the transplant must be done within 48 hours as the cells have a lifespan of only 72 hours			0
@entity1 was prepared with high - dose chemotherapy to wipe out her immune system so her body would accept the new cells			1
though her donor was a perfect match , the transplant still carried a 20 per cent risk of her dying , due to infection or rejection of the cells			1
the transplant on november 25 , 2011 was just like a blood trans - fusion , says @entity1			1
‘ i did have terrible pain in my back for about a week after , which i was told was my body fighting the new stem cells			0
’ it takes three weeks for the donor immune system to start working , and with her own immune system in decline , @entity1 was kept in hospital			1
' she was discharged on christmas eve , feeling ‘ very weak ’			0
gradually , her new immune system started to fight the leukaemia			0
by the summer , @entity1 ’s strength had returned and she now feels extremely well			2
it ’s not until after five years that you can say someone is ‘ cured ’ — but at three years , @entity1 is ‘ in a very good position ’ , says dr @entity145			1
she still takes antiviral and antibiotic drugs as a precaution			0
a year after the transplant , she received a letter through the @entity147 from @entity15 , though their names could n’t be revealed to each other until two years had passed ( to avoid distress for the donor and recipient )			2
‘ it was a very sweet letter , ’ she says			0
‘ he just said : “ i ’m really glad to help you			0
” ’ they exchanged @entity309 cards and then decided to meet			0
‘ i ’d wanted to know where my stem cells had gone , ’ says @entity15			2
‘ i wanted to know if it worked			0
’ he says the decision to donate was a simple one			0
‘ if you have the chance to help someone , you should do it , ’ he says			2
