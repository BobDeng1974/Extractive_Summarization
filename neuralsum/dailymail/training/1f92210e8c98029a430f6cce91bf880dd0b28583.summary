' i 'm fighting fit for the upcoming campaign			0
i did n't weigh myself at the start of january or at the end but i am wearing suits that i have n't squeezed into for years			0
' mr @entity0 is famous for enjoying a pint of beer in front of the cameras but was overheard saying he ' would n't mind a @entity65 ' as he arrived at the venue			2
the unlikely health regime did not stop mr @entity0 from tucking into a tub of @entity5 - branded popcorn as he appeared at the cinema			1
mr @entity0 used his speech to rule out entering a coalition with either @entity17 or the @entity18 after the election with the polls showing that no party is likely to get an overall majority in may , mr @entity0 ruled out entering a formal coalition government with either @entity17 or the @entity18			1
he said the three main parties do not ' believe in @entity79 ' and predicted @entity5 would win ' significantly more ' than two or three seats			2
the only firm ' red line ' commitment he made during the speech was that the party would not compromise on its call for an @entity88 referendum			0
mr @entity0 added : ' we will not enter a coalition , no matter how tempting ministerial cars may be			1
' we will only do a deal with anyone on the condition that there is an in / out referendum on the @entity88			0

@entity5 branding for the event covered popcorn boxes , posters , balloons and even a smart car mr @entity0 claimed his party was digging in to ' the ethnic community vote ' , adding that there would be ' lots of @entity5 candidates ' from minorities in the general election campaign @entity47 is a key target seat for @entity5 , with mr @entity0 predicting his party will win ' significantly more ' than two or three seats natonwide mr @entity0 also claimed his party was digging in to ' the ethnic community vote ' , adding that there would be ' lots of @entity5 candidates ' from minorities in the general election campaign			1
he told the crowd : ' we have crossed the class barrier in @entity79 politics			0
that is a remarkable achievement for @entity5 and we pick up support from across every social spectrum			2
' and we are also beginning now to dig quite deep into some of the ethnic community vote in this country as well , because people that have come to this country legally , that have made this country their home , that have integrated within our society , they want the @entity5 agenda as much as anybody else			2
' and what you will see during this election campaign are lots of @entity5 candidates from the ethnic minorities			1
it is something the commentariat in @entity147 probably wo n't understand but i think all of us in this room do			0
' mr @entity0 drank a cup of tea at the @entity152 during a campaign stop on @entity28 in @entity8 mr @entity0 , who is running to be an mp in @entity155 , said the party 's policies - aside from taking the @entity79 out of the @entity88 - included taking those on the minimum wage out of tax , scrapping tuition fees for science and engineering students , stopping @entity163 and injecting £ 3bn more a year into the @entity164			1
he added he would ' fight ' for a right of recall for mps and axe taxes such as the so - called ' bedroom tax ' and @entity17 's mooted mansion tax			1
but last night he claimed the party 's supporters were more interested in its general approach than its detailed policies			0
he said : ' we will have a fully - costed manifesto , with policies across a range of issues			0
but i actually think people are looking for the right type of people – they are sick of the college kids of the political class who are in hock to the big corporates			0
we are different – we are unashamed to be patriotic			0
' it 's about a state of mind , an attitude			0
we are on the side of the small guy , we are on the side of patriotic people , we believe in a @entity79 that is free and independent with a proper border control policy , and people know that			0
' @entity17 frontbencher @entity198 said : ' no single speech is going to hide @entity5 and @entity0 's long - held beliefs on increasing @entity164 privatisation and further tax breaks for those at the top			1
' the truth is @entity5 are a party of @entity207 people , @entity207 policies and @entity207 money : they are more @entity207 than the @entity18			1
