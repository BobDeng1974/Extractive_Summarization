stores have been accused of using copycat products , hiding away ingredients and inflating packs to fool shoppers			1
a study by consumer champions has identified ten packaging tricks which risk misleading customers about the health , quality and quantity of what they are getting			1
which ? surveyed hundreds of products and asked more than 7,800 of its members to point the finger at companies that are misleading shoppers			2
a which ? survey found that @entity23 's @entity22 juice was made from 87 percent apple it found examples of fruit juice cartons where the main ingredient was omitted from the pack name and relegated to small print			1
for example , @entity32 juice is actually 87per cent cheaper apple juice , while the firm ’s @entity35 is 96per cent a mix of apple and orange			1
many companies put nutrition information on the front of packs which is designed to tell shoppers ‘ at a glance ’ how healthy they are in relation to other similar products			2
however , a number use unrealistically small portion sizes as the basis of these nutrition claims , which makes the products appear healthier			2
for example , @entity53 offers a small individual ‘ @entity57 ’ cheese and tomato pizza that weighs just 165g , which would normally be eaten whole			2
however , the firm gives fat , salt , sugar and calorie information for just half the pizza			1
similarly , the nutrition information on the front of a @entity68 ’s extra thin pizza is given based on someone eating just one quarter of it when most people would eat at least half			2
which ? found that some packs of sausages and bacon given nutrition information based on eating just one sausage or rasher , when most people would eat two or three			2
the editor of which ? magazine , @entity84 , said : ‘ we ’ve found packaging tactics across the supermarkets that run the risk of misleading customers			2
supermarkets and manufacturers need to play fair to avoid confusing consumers			2
@entity23 's @entity35 juice is made from 96 per cent apple and orange juice ‘ we ’re campaigning for simple food pricing to make it easy for consumers to compare products and find the best deal			1
’ as we approach @entity101 , many people will be buying gift packs as presents			2
however , which ? found a @entity106 pack containing a deodorant and shower gel for £ 6.50 which could be bought separately for £ 5			2
researchers also found a @entity111 gift set for £ 4.50 containing products that could be bought for £ 4.40			2
a number of supermarkets have created own - label products that bear an uncanny resemblance to big brands , which manufacturers have spent millions of pounds to create and promote			0
the budget chains @entity120 and @entity121 appear particularly keen to borrow from famous brands			0
some 39per cent of people surveyed by which ? thought @entity121 ’s @entity125 were actually @entity127 ’s @entity126			1
@entity121 ’s @entity128 of tomato soup can looks very much like the @entity131 version			0
@entity120 ’s @entity132 also look similar to the popular ‘ @entity134 ’ brand			0
earlier this year , @entity120 was forced to remove its ‘ @entity143 ’ from sale following complaints and legal action from the @entity138 , who said they were a copy of its packs			0
which ? also found that companies use deliberately inflated packs to give a false impression			0
for example , it found boxes of @entity152 fingers were only two thirds full , while packs of @entity157 the @entity155 biscuits were only 60per cent full			1
some products contain ingredients that shoppers , particularly vegetarians , would not expect			0
for example , drinks like @entity162 and @entity163 orange squash with no added sugar contain fish gelatine			1
one of the biggest problems faced by shoppers is comparing the price of packaged fruit and veg versus the same products sold loose			1
in theory , those sold loose should be cheaper , but this is not always the case			1
which ? found bananas sold loose worked out at just 68p a kilo , while those sold in plastic bags were at least £ 1 a kilo			1
other problems include products sold as ‘ @entity184 ’ when this is not necessarily the case , ‘ light ’ products that are not as healthy as they may appear and product descriptions on cooked meat which are not clear example : @entity32 & @entity192 is actually 87 % apple juice , 9 % mango puree ; 4 % passion fruit juice			1
@entity196 & @entity35 is mainly apple and orange with only 2 % lemon and 2 % lime			1
response : @entity23 said drinks are named according to the main flavour , rather than the main ingredient			1
small portion size used to skew nutrition figures			0
example : @entity209 ‘ essential ’ pizza bases front of pack nutrition figures on only half the product			0
@entity68 ’s pizza uses only one quarter of pizza for its figures			0
response : @entity53 said the portion size represents a typical meal which would include other elements			0
@entity68 ’s is changing labels to give figures for half a pizza @entity53 's ‘ essential ’ pizza bases front of pack nutrition figures on only half the product copycat brands			1
example : @entity121 ’s @entity125 mimic @entity127 ’s product ; @entity120 ’s @entity132 are similar to ‘ @entity228 ’s ’			0
response : @entity120 says generic colours help shoppers find what they want			0
@entity121 says it ensures own - label are clearly differentiated			0
poor value gift sets example : @entity106 gift set costing £ 6.50 contained a deodorant and shower gel that would normally cost £ 5			0
response : manufacturer , @entity240 said retailers set the prices			0
excess packaging example : @entity247 114g box is two - thirds full ; @entity157 the @entity248 is only 60 % full response : @entity157 ’s blamed ‘ settling ’ in the bag			0
@entity152 ’s said it is reducing packaging			0
@entity247 114g box is only two - thirds full but the company said it is reducing the size of packaging off - putting names hidden in the small print example : @entity157 ’s @entity258 chicken breast slices are actually ‘ cooked , reformed chicken with less than 15 % added water , and starch ’ ; @entity121 ’s @entity263 honey roast ham slices are ‘ cooked and honey roasted reformed ham slices with added water ’			1
response : the product details are clear on the pack			0
@entity184 example : @entity272 chocolate bars carry @entity184 logo , however not all the cocoa it uses comes from a @entity184 farmer			0
response : @entity277 say it is not always possible to keep @entity184 and @entity279 cocoa separate			0
@entity184 farmers get a price premium of $ 200 dollars per tonne			0
fruit and @entity283 example : produce sold in packaging is not always clearly labelled to help shoppers make a price comparison with items sold loose			1
response : supermarkets say they include information in terms of price per kilo on the shelves of packaged and loose produce			1
surprise ingredients example : @entity299 and @entity163 orange squash with no added sugar contain small amounts of fish gelatine not listed in the ingredients			1
response : both brands are owned by @entity307 which said it avoids the use of ingredients of animal origin in its drinks , but in some cases this is not possible			0
@entity314 may appear healthy , however it actually contains 45g of fat per 100g light example : @entity314 may appear healthy , however it contains 45g of fat per 100g ; @entity127 ’s @entity318 contain 4.5g of sugar per 100g than standards ones ; @entity322 ’s @entity321 contains 21.9g of sugar and 21.9g of fat per 100g			1
response : @entity240 said the @entity314 label complies with the rules ; @entity127 ’s said the removal of fat from the digestives , required an increase in the carbohydrate and sugar ; the @entity322 brand said the fat level was 50 % less than the original product .			1

@entity23 's @entity32 juice is 87per cent apple juice
the company 's @entity35 is a 96per cent mix of apple and orange
@entity163 and @entity299 may have no added sugar but do use fish gelatin
which ? discovered that loose fruit is more *expensive* than *pre-bagged*
