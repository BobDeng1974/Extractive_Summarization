by @entity0 and @entity1 cooking on gas : @entity4 chief executive @entity3 is to receive £ 4.1million pay for his efforts last year while customers ' bills are set to soar the owners of @entity10 last night threatened to increase energy bills by £ 130 – on the same day that they approved multi-million pound pay packages for the firm ’s bosses			1
the energy giant ’s parent company , @entity4 , yesterday said rising costs could push the average household ‘ dual - fuel tariff ’ to a record high of around £ 1,400			1
despite a shareholders ’ revolt at yesterday ’s annual meeting , the company still agreed to hand out lavish packages to its executive board			1
some 16 per cent of shareholders refused to back the deal , which will see chief executive @entity3 receive pay and perks of £ 4.1million for last year ’s work			1
he was also awarded shares worth an additional £ 5.05million which he could be entitled to receive in 2014 depending on the company ’s performance			2
his perks include a £ 684 discount on his annual energy bill – more than half the amount paid by the average family			1
the company last year put up rates by 18 per cent for gas and 16 per cent for electricity for its 15million customers			0
yesterday ’s annual meeting was the latest where shareholders hit back against vast executive packages , in what has been dubbed the ‘ @entity50 ’			1
earlier this week insurance giant @entity51 saw its chief executive @entity53 resign after shareholders opposed his £ 5.2million pay			1
double standards : the energy giant 's parent company , @entity4 , yesterday said rising costs could push the average household ' dual - fuel tariff ' to a record high of around £ 1,400 his exit followed those of @entity67 ’s @entity66 and drugs giant @entity65 ’s @entity68			1
last night , @entity4 said wholesale energy prices for next winter have increased and the trend for tariffs ‘ remains upwards			2
’ it said green taxes will also put up prices			0
the firm said : ‘ @entity76 wholesale gas costs are around 15 per cent higher for next winter than last , and non-commodity costs ... are expected to add a further £ 50 to the cost of supplying the average household this year			1
’ it means that the group will no longer be able to keep rates at current levels – currently £ 1,232 for the average dual - fuel bill			2
analysts suggest this would drive up the annual bill by £ 130 to £ 1,362			1
last night consumer groups questioned whether the increases were fair			0
@entity91 of @entity92 , the official customer body , said : ‘ consumers will need clear evidence that price rises are warranted if they are to stomach further increases to their bills			0
‘ the perception is that suppliers are quick to pass on high price rises and slow to pass on small price cuts			0
' much greater transparency on costs , pricing and profits is needed for customers to know whether they ’re getting a fair deal			0
' wholesale prices go up and down but customers need to know this is accurately reflected in their bill			0
’ departing : earlier this week @entity51 's chief executive @entity53 resigned after shareholders refused his £ 5.2m pay demands			1
his exit comes in the wake of a string of others including @entity67 's @entity66 @entity120 , of energy price comparison site @entity121 , described the threat of higher prices as ‘ deeply worrying ’			0
he said : ‘ any further increases will see even more people seriously struggling to afford their bills			0
we would urge all suppliers to hold fire for as long as possible and to ensure that if they do move it is only in response to a sustained upward trend			0
‘ it ’s also important that they recognise the impact it will have on their customers			0
’ yesterday shareholders called on mr @entity3 and @entity76 gas managing director @entity142 , to quit			0
one investor said they should use their perks to pay the company ’s £ 2.5million fine , imposed on @entity76 gas by energy regulator @entity148 for failing customers			1
profits at @entity4 last year were just under £ 2.5billion , with @entity152 analysts predicting the figure will surge 20 per cent this year to reach £ 2.9billion			2
pointing the finger : labour energy spokesman @entity155 said those struggling to make ends meet will be astonished that @entity4 is now threatening another round of price hikes @entity10 profits are expected to rise from £ 522million in 2011 to £ 592million this year			2
@entity161 , of @entity162 , said : ‘ wholesale gas increases of 15 per cent typically translate to bill increases of 10 per cent , so we could expect the average bill to rise by around £ 80 a year			2
‘ on top of this , @entity10 has also said that other costs have increased by £ 50 per household			2
in total , this would translate to a £ 130 a year or 19 per cent gas price rise			0
‘ this would take the average gas and electricity bill to over £ 1,400 a year , the highest in history and beating the previous record years of 2011 and 2008			1
’ labour energy spokesman @entity155 said : ‘ hard - pressed families and pensioners struggling to make ends meet thanks to the recession made in @entity183 will be astonished that @entity4 , who made billions in profits and paid out millions in bonuses last year , are now threatening another round of price hikes			0
