it was all about the principle			0
‘ if they had not given me the money back , i would have booked my mother ’s ashes on to the flight and strapped her in the seat that i had booked for her			0
‘ she had a valid passport so i do n’t think there was any way they could have refused to take her ashes			0
‘ i would also have put the ashes in the wheelchair that i had reserved for her at the airport , and i would have filmed everything and posted the video on @entity200			0
‘ you expect to get a rough ride with these cheap airlines , but you do n’t expect to get tied to a contract which is so far bent in the airline ’s favour that you ca n’t conceivably win			0
