to this day , the 1973 film @entity0 ignites feelings of sheer terror in anyone brave enough to watch it			2
the only comfort afterwards is that at least it 's only fictional			2
but @entity8 scholars argue that the horrifying events truly did take place , when a young boy was demonically possessed in 1949			1
packed into a university library - at the school which was attended by the real ' possessed ' child - scholars and experts debated whether there was truth in the parody , just in time for @entity19			1
scroll down for @entity20 the real exorcism : rev. @entity22 , director of the @entity23 , tells a packed audience about the real demon - purging practice that took place at @entity28 's former hsopital @entity8 scholars have joined a whole new generation of horror buffs in @entity28 to recount the supernatural incident			1
@entity28 hosted the panel discussion yesterday on the exorcism , which involved the treatment of an unidentified suburban @entity35 , boy			1
university junior @entity36 has never seen ' the @entity0 ' film , considered one of the finest examples of unadulterated cinematic terror			2
he 's only vaguely familiar with the month - long 1949 demon - purging ritual at his school on which the film and @entity45 's 1971 novel were based			1
' i 'd like to believe it 's the real thing , ' said @entity36 , a theology and sociology student from @entity50			0
' but you just ca n't know			0
that 's part of why we 're here			0
it 's the pursuit of truth			0
and it 's such a great story			1
' terrifying : the @entity8 scholars argue that the story of a demonic - child in 1949 inspired the 1973 film @entity0 , pictured iconic : the demon - purging ritual performed on the 12 - year - old girl in the film was also carried out over a month - long period on a 13 - year - old boy at the @entity68 school 's former hospital about 500 people crammed into @entity70 , with some spilling into the aisles , leaning against pillars or sitting on desks			1
the university scholars and guest speaker @entity75 , author of a 1993 account of the events at the school 's former @entity78 , emphasized that definitive proof that the boy known only as ' @entity82 ' was possessed by malevolent spirits is unattainable			1
maybe he instead suffered from mental illness or sexual abuse - or fabricated the entire experience			1
assisted : the exorcism was carried out on the child by father @entity89 , who was assisted by rev. @entity90 , pictured			1
@entity92 expressed his skepticism about potential paranormal events before his death like most of religion 's basic tenets , it ultimately comes down to faith			0
' if the devil can convince us he does not exist , then half the battle is won , ' said the rev. @entity104 , vice president for mission and ministry at the 195 - year - old catholic school			1
he opened the discussion with a prayer from the church 's exorcism handbook , imploring @entity112 to ' fill your servants with courage to fight that reprobate dragon			1
' some of the non-students in the audience spoke of personal connections to an episode that has enthralled generations of @entity28 residents			2
one man described living near the suburban @entity28 home where the 13 - year - old boy arrived in the winter of 1949 ( his @entity128 mother was a @entity28 native who married a @entity129 )			2
another said she was a distant cousin of father @entity89 , who led the exorcism ritual after consulting with the archbishop of @entity28 , but remained publicly silent about his experiences - though he did tell @entity75 it was ' the real thing '			1
@entity89 was assisted by the rev. @entity136 , who unlike his colleague spoke openly with @entity75 and expressed his skepticism about potential paranormal events before his death a decade ago			0
' he talked more about the boy , and how much he suffered , and less about the rite , ' @entity75 said			0
' here was a scared , confused boy caught up in something he did n't understand			0
' he told me , " i simply do n't know , " and that is where i leave it , ' the author added			2
' i just do n't know			0
' @entity75 zealously protects the anonymity of ' @entity82 , ' despite others ' efforts to track him down to this day			0
it is unlikely the young boy 's head was spinning 360 degrees , as actress @entity156 's did in the 1973 film attendees to the panel debate appeared to be left divided on whether they believed demonic - possession truly happened or not			1
@entity161 , a scene from the 1973 film @entity164 , a 59 - year - old accountant who left work early to attend the campus event , said he also is unsure whether ' @entity0 ' was a work of fiction or instead a riveting real - life account of barely comprehensible forces			2
he does know this : he can not forget the movie that he saw with a buddy four decades ago			0
they drove 100 miles ( 160 kilometers ) from their home in @entity176 , @entity177 , to the nearest theater showing it across the state line in @entity180			0
' i saw the movie when i was 19 years old and it scared me to death , ' @entity164 said			0
' i think it 's the scariest movie ever made			0

@entity186 hospital spent a month trying to purge the demon from a child
@entity8 scholars told the story of the month - long exorcism that saved him
a packed audience was divided on whether to believe he was possessed
