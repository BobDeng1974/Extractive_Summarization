@entity0 says it will replace the hi - tech synthetic oil used in seven - speed dual - clutch gearboxes with traditional mineral oil			1

as a result , @entity0 issued a global voluntary recall for all cars fitted with the seven - speed drives			1
in addition , 30,000 @entity64 are being recalled in the @entity3 because of a problem with fuses which cause headlights to cut out ( file picture ) drivers in @entity71 have campaigned vociferously for some months over the problem after motorists lost power			1

on the gearbox fault , a @entity0 spokesman at the car giant ’s headquarters in @entity102 , @entity98 said : ' it has been discovered that , with vehicles with a 7 - speed dual - clutch gearbox ( @entity107 ) , electric malfunctions could occur in the gearbox power supply if synthetic gearbox oil is used			1
‘ this applies in particular if the vehicle is subject to a hot and humid climate , coupled with a high proportion of stop and go driving			0
’ he added : ‘ studies have established that using mineral oil will rectify this problem			2
' to continue to ensure customer satisfaction among @entity121 [ dual - clutch gearboxes ] , @entity0 has decided to launch global voluntary campaign and to request all customers with a 7 - speed dual - clutch gearbox ( @entity107 ) filled with synthetic oil to visit a workshop for an oil exchange			1
