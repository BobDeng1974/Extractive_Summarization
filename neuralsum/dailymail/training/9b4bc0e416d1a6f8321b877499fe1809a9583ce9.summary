by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 21:03 est , 1 march 2013 updated : 21:07 est , 1 march 2013 she is @entity3 ’s first and only woman prime minister , and the longest - serving for 150 years			0
and now , to celebrate her unique place in @entity3 history , a statue of @entity5 could be erected in her home town of @entity9 , after @entity11 councillors changed their minds and backed the proposal			1
until now , the @entity15 market town town had been split over plans for a statue of @entity5 with some fearing it could be a target for vandals and protesters			1
@entity5 stands next to the £ 150,000 white marble statue of her in 2002			2
shortly after , it was famously decapitated by a protester			0
now restored , it has been offered to the @entity25 more than two decades after her fall from power , it had been suggested that @entity25 could house a repaired white marble statue			2
@entity9 museum said that any decision would be taken with the views of local residents in mind but that proposal is off the table			1
but @entity5 seems to have found an unlikely ally , with @entity11 councillors proposing a separate commemorative work to attract tourists , the @entity38 reported			1
@entity42 , has called on the @entity44 majority to support an exhibit and statue or bust of @entity5			2
the statue of @entity5 at the @entity49 she told the @entity38 : ' despite our personal strength of feeling about her , we feel the controversy and outside interest around @entity5 provides an opportunity to attract international tourists to our town			1
' the 8ft £ 150,000 artwork originally proposed was made by sculptor @entity60 and commissioned by the @entity61 and was decapitated by a protester within weeks of going on display at a gallery in the @entity65 in 2002			0
it has spent much of the period since its repair in storage at the @entity70			0
@entity71 previously suggested that displaying a monument to @entity5 could be ‘ asking for trouble ’			0
she said some of @entity5 ’s policies remain controversial and the statue might be open to more attacks if it was erected in her home town			1
‘ placing it anywhere in a public place in @entity9 , it could be open to a similar event occurring , ’ miss @entity42 said			1
@entity5 , who won three general elections and was prime minister between 1979 and 1990 , was born and went to school in @entity9			1
but at the former grocery shop and post office where @entity5 grew up , there is nothing more than a small plaque			0
the shop is now a holistic centre , and her childhood bedroom is used for massage therapy			0
despite calls from successive mayors for a statue of @entity5 , her legacy seems to be so divisive that such proposals have never got beyond the planning stage			2
@entity9 lies within @entity44 - controlled @entity101			2
the @entity60 statue was unveiled by the former prime minister in 2002 , but attacked with a metal pole at @entity49 by theatre producer @entity105 two months later			0
at the former grocery shop and post office where @entity5 grew up , there is nothing more than a small plaque to mark its connection with the future @entity5 the former @entity3 prime minister at 10 @entity113 with @entity114 in 2010			0
a @entity11 councillor suggested that displaying a monument to @entity5 in a prominent place could be ' asking for trouble ' the grocer 's daughter , who went on to be pm from 1979 until 1990 , was born in @entity9 and went to @entity121			1
she is seen above visiting the school in 1982 the volunteer - run @entity9 museum , which already boasts a @entity125 puppet of @entity5 and one of her trademark blue suits , said a decision had not yet been made about the offer ( file picture ) @entity131 , manager of @entity25 , said : ‘ it does need to go somewhere , but how the town responds to the life of @entity5 has to be a town decision			1
’ @entity9 already has a statue and shopping centre dedicated to a famous son , sir @entity138 , and many think it is time for @entity5 , now 87 , to be honoured			1
‘ if you were walking through the town you would never know she had anything to do it , ’ said poultry manager @entity141 , 39			0
‘ tourists come from all over the world because it is where she is from			0
’ teaching assistant @entity149 , 33 , added : ‘ a lot of things she did were n’t popular with @entity11 voters but she was our first woman prime minister and for that she should be recognised			2
who knows when the next one will come along ? ’ a bronze statue of @entity5 , unveiled in 2007 , stands in the @entity156 ’ lobby at the @entity61 .			0
