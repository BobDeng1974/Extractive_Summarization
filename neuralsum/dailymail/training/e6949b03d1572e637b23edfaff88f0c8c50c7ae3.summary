an arachnophobe has kept her windows shut for three years because the tree outside her home is infested with spiders			1
@entity6 , 34 , is so terrified of the creatures that she has asked @entity9 to cut the tree down			1
she said her chronic fear of arachnids brings her out in goosebumps			1
even when i see a little house spider i have to get my son to kill it for me			0
i 've got goosebumps just thinking about it			0
' but as for these spiders - they 've been multiplying in the tree over a long summer and there are thousands of them			1
they have got these huge cocoons under the gutters and on my windows there are massive webs			0
' there are even spider cocoons in my windows			0
they were nesting in a little panel at the top			0
i 'm so desperate to keep them out i 've put a line of chestnuts on every windowsill in the house			0
i know it 's an old wives tale , but i 've got to do something			2
' i do n't want to move out because i 've got beautiful neighbours			0
this place feels like home to me			2
' @entity14 , 34 , is so terrified of the creatures that she has asked @entity9 to cut the tree down she said : ' there are even spider cocoons in my windows			1
they were nesting in a little panel at the top ' ms @entity14 said the tree has also stopped light entering her eight - year - old son 's bedroom and has blocked her phone signal at her home in of @entity62 in @entity63			1
ms @entity14 said she is so distressed by the army of eight - legged creatures that since she moved in three years ago she has only opened the windows on the other side of the house which are well away from the reach of the spiders in the tree			1
she claims @entity72 council have not responded to her requests to cut it down			2
' after i posted a note online , someone came and hacked off some of the branches so it is a bit better now , but no one ever calls me about it			0
' she is so distressed by the army of eight - legged creatures that since she moved in three years ago she has only opened the windows on the other side of the house which are well away from the reach of the spiders ms @entity14 said she has suffered from arachnophobia for as long as she can remember			1
' the only thing i can do is pay the guy who cleans the windows a little bit extra to clear away the webs and cocoons , ' she said			0
@entity63 councillor @entity96 said : ' we do n't have a letter from ms @entity14 on record , but now that we are aware of this we will see what we can do			0
however it is unlikely that the council would cut down the tree as it is their policy not to cut down healthy trees			1
' as it happens we have been trying to get some other trees pruned for about five years on @entity62 , and so we will be adding her concerns to a letter we are addressing to the council 's parks department			2
' @entity72 council has been asked to comment .			2
