officers with a finger on the trigger of the @entity4 's most powerful nuclear missiles are complaining of a wide array of morale - sapping pressures , according to internal emails			1
the complaints shed fresh light on dissatisfactions affecting the critical arm of the @entity4 , an undercurrent that has captured the attention of the service 's leaders			1
key themes among the complaints include working under ' poor leadership ' and being stuck in ' dead - end careers ' in nuclear weapons , one email said			1
crews from the @entity23 at @entity24 in @entity25 ( pictured ) made the complaints in an unpublished study the sentiments were expressed privately by members of the @entity23 at @entity24 , @entity25 , in an unpublished study for the @entity4			1
the complaints also said there was a need for more experienced missile officers , a less arduous work schedule and ' leaders who will listen			0
' taken together , the complaints suggest sagging morale in arguably the most sensitive segment of the @entity41 military			1
the 91st at @entity24 operates 150 intercontinental ballistic missiles — one - third of the entire @entity46 force			1
the missiles stand in underground silos on constant alert for launch within minutes of a presidential order			0
in the nuclear missile business , morale is not a trivial matter			0
mental state is treated as a vital sign - like physical health , criminal record and technical know - how - that must be monitored to indicate whether an individual is fit to be trusted with weapons of such destructive power			0
the question of morale at @entity24 coincides with trouble inside the ranks of the 91st			1
the @entity68 reported on may 8 that 17 launch crew members - representing about 10 per cent of the launch crew force - had been taken off duty for remedial training following a poor showing in a key portion of an inspection			1
the story was based on an april 12 internal @entity4 email that said the 91st suffered from ' rot ' within its ranks , including tolerance of weapons safety rules violations			2
@entity4 leaders told @entity83 the problem was less about poor performance than about poor attitude			1

crews at the base operate 150 missiles - one third of the entire force last week the @entity4 said two additional launch officers at @entity24 had been sidelined , for a total of 19			1
an @entity4 spokesman , lt. col. @entity96 , said that 10 of the 19 had completed the two - month process of regaining certification			1
most of the rest are expected to do so by the end of this month			0
the @entity68 obtained a second internal @entity4 email describing morale issues at @entity24 , which were hinted at broadly in the first email			1
both notes were written by lt. col. @entity106 , deputy commander of the unit in charge of the 91st 's three missile squadrons at @entity24			2
the second @entity106 email , dated march 21 , said complaints were registered in a confidential study initiated by the @entity4 's most senior officer , gen. @entity114 , who was considering ' solutions to our problems			1
' the study was done between december 2012 and february 2013 by the @entity119 , a federally funded think tank that @entity121 enlisted to study workforce issues inside the three missile wings , including the one at @entity24			2
the email briefly summarized complaints at @entity24 ; it did not refer to what people at the other two missile wings — at @entity128 , @entity129 , and @entity130 , @entity131 — told the researchers			2
the @entity4 confirmed to the @entity68 that @entity106 and his immediate superior , col. @entity134 , are leaving their posts , but @entity96 , spokesman for the @entity136 , said both are being moved in a ' normal rotation			0
' in a telephone interview about the @entity119 study and the @entity106 emails , maj. gen. @entity142 , who as commander of the 20th @entity4 is responsible for all three missile wings , acknowledged a degree of discontent at @entity24 but said more study is required before he and @entity121 can pinpoint all the dimensions of the issue			1
asked about the complaints about weak leadership , @entity142 said on may 31 , ' i certainly take it to heart			0
' @entity142 , who was briefed on @entity119 's findings on march 20 , said that despite the various complaints , morale at @entity24 is ' not bad			1
' he said that on a recent visit to the 91st he found missile crews optimistic and upbeat			0
members from @entity24 ( pictured a @entity163 from the base ) complained the job is a ' dead end career ' ' they are not unhappy , ' he said			1
@entity142 said some complaints are rooted in a lack of communication from higher headquarters about plans for modernizing the nuclear force even as the @entity4 faces tighter budgets			2
@entity142 said he could not provide a copy of @entity119 's findings because they have not yet been presented to @entity121			0
the study was based on interviews with missile launch officers as well as enlisted airmen who support that work			0
in the earlier email obtained by the @entity68 , @entity106 said there was ' such rot ' within the force that launch officers tolerated weapons safety rule violations , possible violations of missile launch codes and other failings deemed unacceptable			0
the @entity68 story based on that email triggered strong responses from some in @entity83 , including sen. @entity194 , @entity195 , who wondered aloud what lay behind the turmoil inside the missile force			0
part of the answer , in the view of many experts , is the shrinking role and size of the @entity41 nuclear force and , consequently , a reduced sense of purpose among launch crews who do 24 - hour shifts in control centers buried deep below ground			2
the @entity41 has 450 deployed icbms , down from about 1,000 at the end of the @entity215 , and current projections call for only 420 within five years			2
some have argued for eliminating the missiles altogether			0
many experts say the seemingly low morale is due to the shrinking role and size of the @entity41 nuclear force ( pictured a @entity223 at @entity224 ) @entity225 , a nuclear weapons expert at the @entity227 , said that @entity46 launch crew officers have told him over a period of years that morale has been on the decline			2
' you ca n't take away the fact that the mission they sit and wait for [ to launch a nuclear attack ] is very unlikely to ever happen , ' @entity225 said			0
' that affects career choices and morale because they talk to their other @entity4 buddies who come home after flying @entity242 over @entity243 or @entity244 and it 's very exciting to be in that part of the @entity4 [ while the icbm launch crews ] sit in a hole in the @entity248 and wait for nothing			2
' a @entity251 advisory panel report two years ago cited multiple aspects of a morale problem within the nuclear force			0
it said the @entity4 's traditional emphasis on fighter and bomber operations leaves nuclear officers feeling marginalized , all the more because their work is out of public view and veiled in secrecy			0
' they perceive a lack of knowledge of and respect for their mission from within the larger @entity4 , ' the panel reported			0
@entity268 , a military affairs expert formerly with the @entity270 , said the @entity4 faces a difficult task in attracting and keeping high - quality officers to fill the missile launch crew positions			1
' they can of course assign new second lieutenants involuntarily , as any service does , but that would n't exactly create high @entity278 in a component of the @entity4 that just seems less and less relevant — and , importantly , is virtually unknown to the @entity41 public , ' @entity268 said in an email exchange .			1
