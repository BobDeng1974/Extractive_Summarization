@entity0 is feeling ' really comfortable ' over his future no matter which way the dice may fall at @entity4			1
a decision from the team as to whether @entity0 or @entity7 will partner the returning @entity8 next year is likely to be announced on friday			1
it follows a board meeting on thursday involving @entity12 ceo @entity11 and two other primary shareholders in @entity15 co-owner @entity14 and @entity16 , ceo of @entity17 , @entity19 's sovereign wealth fund			1
it is understood @entity7 will get the nod , with @entity0 switching to sportscars and a crack at the @entity36 where good friends and two other former @entity39 drivers in @entity40 and @entity41 currently ply their trade			1
@entity41 even became a world champion in his own right last month when he and @entity46 team - mate @entity45 , another @entity47 driver , claimed the @entity36 crown			1
such a move would represent a good step for @entity0 , even though he would love an additional year at @entity4 working alongside @entity8			1
the 34 - year - old @entity51 appeared in good spirits as he entertained the crowds in @entity54 on thursday @entity8 pays tribute to his @entity25 team in @entity57 after ending his stay with the @entity60 outfit ' it 's a weird time , ' said @entity0 speaking at a @entity64 ' responsible drinking ' event in @entity24			1
' it 's the end of the season , we have n't got a race for many months , and i have had time to reflect on many things			2
' the great thing is i 've had my family and my mates round , so there have been a lot of people to talk to about it , to discuss			0
' it 's been an important week , but a really good week			0
i 'm now really comfortable , and whatever happens i will have a great year next year			0
' new challenges are exciting , whether it 's in @entity39 with @entity4 alongside an exciting team - mate , or whether it 's elsewhere			1
' so i 'm good , but i just want to get it done			0
i want to hear the decision - as we all do - so we can all move on in whatever direction			0
' @entity0 speaks to the assembled media about his future @entity0 can understand @entity4 pursuing a big name such as @entity8 in light of @entity94 's arrival as power - unit supplier after a seven - year absence from @entity39 , and their desire for a marquee name			1
but he feels it a pity @entity4 could not keep faith with himself and @entity7 given the rapport he has developed with the young @entity102			2
@entity0 added : ' i 've spent some time with @entity7 over the past couple of days , and it 's been really nice doing that			1
' this situation has been difficult for both of us , but we 've shown over the last couple of days that we work so well together			0
' it 's such a shame we wo n't be working together in the future in terms of being team - mates			2
' but we 're both very grown up about the situation and we 'll both deal with it whichever way it goes			0
' @entity0 does have irons in the fire , and whilst nothing is signed as he awaits @entity11 ' decision , he is looking forward to the future			0
' there are options , but nothing set in stone yet , ' added @entity0			2
' what i can say is i 'll definitely be racing next year , and in a series i 'll be very excited to race in , so there 's no worry of me not racing next year			2
' if it 's a new challenge it will be exciting , if it 's in @entity39 it will be very exciting as well because that will be a new challenge with @entity94			0
' video driving for @entity25 ' a unique experience ' - @entity135			0

@entity0 keen to hear whether he will be racing for @entity4 in 2015
@entity139 team had board meeting on thursday to discuss whether @entity0 or @entity7 will partner @entity8 next season
