by @entity0 published : 10:09 est , 26 june 2013 updated : 10:12 est , 26 june 2013 @entity2 's first purpose - built campsite for new age travellers is facing the axe after only a handful agreed to move in because residents were told to pay council tax			1
officials were due to spend £ 1.2million of public money transforming an existing illegal camp into fifteen state - of - the - art eco plots			1
they promised communal allotments , a children 's play area , a site manager and environmentally friendly features such as composting bins			1
but the plans have stalled after one tenth of the itinerants currently there do not want to stay because they will not want to fork out for council tax			2
changes : a £ 1.2m plan to transform this illegal travellers site at @entity28 near @entity29 has been scrapped because residents have refused to pay council tax the council had secured a massive £ 1.2million grant from the @entity33 ( @entity33 ) to pay for the camp , described as the first of its type in the country			1
it has left @entity40 in @entity41 facing a £ 40,000 - a - year management bill for an mostly empty site - or handing back the grant to the government			1
but if the council take the grant , build the site but then no - one moves in - the authority may be forced to pay back the £ 1.2million			1
and they say the only way to make that back would be to increase council tax on local residents by 0.7 per cent a year			2
a council spokesman said : ' the @entity33 have advised the council that should the site cease to operate they are entitled to require repayment in full of the £ 1.12m grant			2
' assurances have been sought from the @entity33 that they would not do so but these have not been given			0
' should the site cease to operate , the land value is likely to be a very small fraction of the grant value , leaving the council at risk of having to repay most if not all of the £ 1.12m back to the agency			2
' cash : the local council had secured a grant for the site but if the transformation is shelved they may have to pay back the cash the woodland setting has been used illegally for twelve years at @entity28 , a nationally recognised wildlife haven off the @entity73 near @entity29 in @entity41			1
it became home to caravans , old buses , huts and shelters housing up to 100 travellers causing tensions with the local community			0
following a ten year debate to find a solution @entity85 won a massive grant to upgrade facilities and make the camp legal			0
it expected existing travellers to jump at the chance to stay - with the only condition being they would have to pay rates to contribute to the £ 40,000 annual running cost			2
in return , travellers were asked to sign a lease agreement , pay service charges and council tax			1
it is thought there are around 100 people there - made up of 15 families and single dwellers			0
the council hoped the families , who have children at local schools , would apply to stay at the new - look camp			0
but only 11 people have applied to remain - and nearly all made up of single travellers and not families			0
closed off : the woodland at @entity28 has been used illegally by travellers for twelve years paused : the site was due to have 15 state - of - the - art eco plots with communal allotments , a children 's play area , a site manager and environmentally friendly features such as composting bins @entity126 , the firm lined up to run the camp , has now said it does not wish to take on an under - used site , populated by mostly single people			1
the @entity33 has given the authority until july 12 to decide if it wants the grant after which the funds will be re-allocated			0
@entity134 , executive spokesman for housing and planning at the council , added : ' the situation has changed , specifically around the amount of formal expressions of interest and subsequent financial risks to @entity143 and that requires further careful consideration			0
' ever since the community first pitched up near pretty @entity149 village in august 2001 it has officially been ' tolerated ' by @entity150 , the overall authority for the area			0
a report for the executive recommends the project should only proceed provided ' satisfactory financial safeguards and indemnities ' are obtained to address the ' financial implications of failure ' .			0

plans *included* 15 eco plots with attached allotments and composting bins
but travellers are said to be upset that they must pay council tax
cash grant received to transform illegal site near @entity29 , @entity41
