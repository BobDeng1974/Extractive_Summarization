a cat that was run down by a car and written off for dead apparently clawed its way out of the grave and made its way home to be fed. @entity7 , a pet found on the street in a pool of blood more than a week ago , was pronounced dead by vets in @entity13 , @entity14			1
but five days later he was outside owner @entity16 's house again expecting dinner - albeit with a gruesome wound which makes him look the part for a member of the living dead			1
though he still needs surgery before it can be certain he 'll pull through , @entity7 's brush with death saw him escape a muddy grave			0
it is unclear how he escaped , but @entity16 is convinced that the battered feline who made his way to his neighbor 's garden - then on home in the hope of a meal - is his revived pet			0
@entity7 's eye will never work again - even if the surgery goes right - but his survival instincts are clearly on top form			2
rescuers at the @entity52 , where he is being treated , believed he may have come to underground , escaped and then hid for a few days before gathering the courage to head home			0
surgery : @entity7 , who is now being cared for by @entity13 's @entity56 , needs to be operated on if he is to ultimately survive the ordeal			2

@entity7 found in a pool of blood more than a week ago and pronounced dead
despite being *buried* , he showed up at owner 's house in @entity13 , @entity14
rescuers think he came to underground , clawed his way out then hid
took five days for his *miraculous* *return* - and now needs surgery to survive
