children who look unhappy in childhood school photographs are five times more likely to get divorced than those who smile most , a scientist claims			2
people who stayed married in later life tended to smile more widely and warmly in their school photographs , while future divorcées were more likely to smile weakly , if at all in their photos			2
a @entity10 psychologist came up with his conclusions when exploring whether school photos reveal who individuals are in a moment in time , or if they can predict their future			1
it 's all in the smile , according to one psychologist : people who stayed married in later life tended to smile more widely and warmly in their school photographs , while future divorcées were more likely to smile weakly , if at all in their photos @entity21 , an associate professor of psychology at @entity23 , @entity24 , measured individuals ’ emotional displays based on photographs in hundreds of school yearbooks to see if he could predict who would get divorced			1
in an article for @entity31 , he said he found that people who smiled least genuinely were five times more likely to get divorced at some point in their lives than those with happy photographs			2
to work out who was smiling strongly , he looked at whether the individual in the photo contracted the muscle that pulls up the lip corners as well as the orbicularis oculi , which is the muscle that makes someone ’s eyes ‘ smile ’ too			0
professor @entity21 said that future divorcées tended not to smile , or if they did , did not contract their orbicularis oculi - indicating a smile that was not genuine			0
together with his team , the psychologist , who is the author of a new book called the tell : the little clues that reveal big truths about who we are , examined the childhood and adolescent yearbook photos of people over the age of 55 in a small town in mid-west @entity10 as part of their research in 2009 , which was published the journal @entity66 , they also looked at photographs of participants at birthdays and graduations and concluded that the photos predicted divorce as accurately as the yearbook photos did			1
@entity21 , an associate professor of psychology at @entity23 , @entity24 , measured individuals ' emotional displays based on photographs in hundreds of school yearbooks to see if he could predict who would get divorced according to a study by psychologists @entity82 and @entity83 in 2001 , college yearbook photographs can also predict whether someone will enjoy a life with less sadness , anxiety and despair 30 years after the graduate			1

individual cases will certainly vary			0
