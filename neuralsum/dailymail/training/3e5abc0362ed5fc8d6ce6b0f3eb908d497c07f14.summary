i was told to say that there was a blackout and everyone should return to their cabins and that things would be returning to normal as quickly as possible			0
' but people were agitated and worried - they wanted to get onto the lifeboats but the order did n't come			2
when the passengers got to the muster stations i was told to try and calm them down , to reassure them			0
' more than 4,000 passengers and crew - including 35 @entity49 - were onboard the @entity2 when it struck an underwater reef off the coast of the @entity53 island of @entity54 just hours after setting sail on a seven - day @entity57 cruise in january last year			1
mrs @entity9 broke down in tears as she told the hearing in the @entity53 town of @entity61 : ' i made announcements in @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity53			1
i called my boss and he said the crew were frightening the passengers with what they were saying			0

i had to tell everyone that there was an electrical problem and everything was going to return to normal			0
' eventually the order to abandon ship came from the second officer - i made a human chain with others to get onto a lifeboat and there must have been around 150 people in it			1
' when i looked back the ship had capsized			1
everyone on the lifeboat was so scared and so was i. i prayed to @entity103 for help asking him to help us and to help me so that i knew what to tell the passengers			0
' @entity27 , who was dubbed captain @entity108 after the incident , is accused of multiple manslaughter , causing a shipwreck and abandoning the @entity2 while passengers and crew were still onboard			1
previously the court has heard how he ended up in a lifeboat ahead of others and at the time of the disaster a tape recording emerged of him being ordered to get back onto the ship by lifeguard officials , but he refused			1

later @entity137 , cabin services director , told the court : ' i did not tell my assistant to tell passengers to return to their cabins			0
' i said that as it was dangerous to remain at the muster stations i suggested it was better people grouped in the lounges and that they should get warm clothing and any medication needed			0
' salvage operators in @entity151 lifted the @entity2 cruise ship upright from its watery grave off the island of @entity54 in september , in the biggest ever project of its kind			0

' mr @entity137 went on : ' he said that we should also tell everyone to " keep calm "			0
' during a break in proceedings , @entity27 's lawyer @entity166 also denied that the order to tell passengers to return to their cabins had come from his client and he said : ' maybe it came from another member of the crew			2
' we hope only that among the victims are people who returned to their cabins as a result of this order which i stress again did not come from the captain			2
' @entity27 has insisted that his actions in fact saved lives and by turning the vessel around and bringing the ship virtually to the entrance of @entity54 harbour he in fact ' saved thousands of lives '			1
the trial is not expected to finish until later next year and prosecutors are looking for a 20 year jail sentence against @entity27			1
a cadet officer told the trial previously that the captain did not ' slip into a lifeboat ' as he claimed - but leaped onto one while stricken passengers and crew were still on board			1
@entity200 said : ' i jumped onto the roof [ of a lifeboat ] but @entity27 was already there , he had jumped just before me			2

we picked up passengers who were in the water as we headed to the shore			0
' while the rescue was ongoing and @entity27 was in the lifeboat , in a widely reported telephone call that was leaked to the media , coastguard chief @entity212 can be heard ordering him : ' get back on board , for f * * * 's sake			1
' @entity27 refused to do so and instead he made his way to a hotel on the island , where he waited for officials to arrive			2
he was later taken away to the mainland where he was arrested and ultimately charged			0
prosecutors say @entity27 deliberately altered the course of the @entity14 so that he could carry out the sail - by salute of @entity54 to impress passengers and islanders , passing fatally close to the reef			1
