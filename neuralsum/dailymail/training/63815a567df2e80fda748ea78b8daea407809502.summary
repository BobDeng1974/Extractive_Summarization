sacked : @entity0 , who has 32 years ' service with the @entity2 , lost his job for playing @entity4 has got his hat on the @entity2 was accused of ‘ appalling ’ double standards last night after forcing a veteran dj to quit after he innocently played an old version of @entity4 has got his hat on which featured the ‘ n ’ word			1
@entity0 was ordered by bosses to ‘ fall on your sword ’ – even though @entity12 presenter @entity11 kept his job when he appeared to mumble exactly the same racist term			1
mr @entity0 lost his job after playing a 1932 version of the song , performed by @entity18 , on his sunday night golden oldies show on @entity20			1
unknown to mr @entity0 , a popular presenter who has spent 32 years with the @entity2 , the secondverse features the line : ‘ he ’s been tanning n * * * * * * out in @entity25 , now he ’s coming back to do the same to you			1
’ the @entity2 took action after just one listener complained to say he was ‘ horrified ’ by what he heard			1
but last night @entity30 faced a storm of protest over its treatment of the 68 - year - old host , who had immediately offered to apologise on air when he realised his ‘ genuine error ’			1
friends and colleagues rallied to his support , while fans used @entity42 to express their incredulity			0
@entity44 , mr @entity0 ’s former boss at @entity20 , said : ‘ to end @entity0 ’s career in this way when @entity11 was given a rap on the knuckles is absolutely appalling			1
it is an outrageous way to treat a loyal and distinguished employee			0
you could n’t wish to meet a nicer man			0
’ and another former @entity20 station manager , @entity54 , added : ‘ it is a tragic end to a 32 - year career with the @entity2			1
i think what they did to @entity0 was disgraceful			2
he is a lovely man and has long been known to his colleagues as the @entity60			0
’ mr @entity0 played a 1932 version of the son , performed by @entity63 , on a sunday night golden oldies show rejecting mr @entity0 ’s offer to apologise , @entity2 executives instead tried to silence him saying : ‘ we prefer that you do n’t mention anything about last week ’s broadcast			1
’ then they asked if they could announce that he wanted to leave to ‘ pursue other interests ’			0
but unwilling to cover up the incident , mr @entity0 refused , and was pointedly ignored when he repeated his desire to apologise to his listeners			1
finally , @entity74 , @entity20 ’s acting editor , wrote to him saying : ‘ i agree you have acted properly throughout and we are grateful for both your apology and your appreciation of the seriousness of the situation			2
' but regrettably , i think we will have to accept your offer to fall on your sword to resolve this situation			2
’ support : mr @entity0 tweets the news of his sacking , and fans back him in their own words in contrast , mr @entity11 , who has a history of making offensive remarks on air , was let off without even a suspension			1
yesterday it emerged that mr @entity11 was saved from disciplinary action by the intervention of director - general @entity98			2
yesterday lunchtime – after being contacted by @entity99 – the @entity2 appeared to undergo an abrupt change of heart over mr @entity0			1
it said in a statement that the situation ‘ could have been handled better ’ adding : ‘ we have offered @entity0 the opportunity to continue presenting his singers and swingers show , and we would be happy to have him back on air			1
’ contrast : mr @entity11 , pictured above using the ' n ' word in an unused scene in @entity12 , was not sacked at this stage , though , mr @entity0 had not been offered his job back			1
‘ it ’s news to me , ’ he said during an interview at his @entity116 home			0
it was to be another two hours before he was called by the @entity2 with their offer			2
the lyrics to @entity4 has got his hat on have been changed several times since @entity124 ( below ) and @entity125 wrote the original in 1932			1
it was composed for the musical @entity129 and first recorded by the @entity130 , with vocals by @entity132			0
the second verse went : ‘ he ’s been tanning n * * * * * s out in @entity25 , now he ’s coming back to do the same for you			0
’ @entity135 , who was jailed in 2001 for sexually abusing teenagers in the 1980s , covered the song in 1971			0
he changed the lyric to : ‘ he ’s been tanning negroes in @entity25			0
’ more recent versions have changed it to : ‘ he ’s been roastin ’ peanuts out in @entity25 ’ or just ‘ shining brightly out in @entity25 ’			0
but he said he was going to turn them down as the stress caused by the row had aggravated his dystonic tremor condition , a permanent shake			0
‘ these events have taken their toll on my disability and i have to put my health first , ’ he said : ‘ i will say thank you but respectfully decline			0
’ ironically , the row was triggered by mr @entity0 being sensitive to the possibility that a requested song might cause offence			1
a woman from @entity158 wanted him to play @entity159 – which featured in an @entity161 beer advert in the 1980s			0
but mr @entity0 was concerned that it mentioned the @entity163 and , after speaking to his producer , decided to play @entity4 has got his hat on instead			1
‘ i thought i ’d avoid the earlier request and play it safe , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s so ironic that i ’ve ended up in a bigger trap of my own making			0
‘ when i was told about it on @entity171 , i thought , “ @entity172 ”			0
my heart was in my mouth			0
' i must have played the song half a dozen times over the years and i ’ve never heard the ‘ n ’ word			1
i said to the person who told me about the song that political correctness will be the death of me			0
‘ twenty - four hours later , all hell broke loose			2
i do n’t have issues with my colleagues but i do have issues with a repressive system that encourages wholly disproportionate reactions to innocent errors of judgment			2
' it is quite topical at the moment with @entity11 although i did n’t actually say the word			2
would it be different if i was @entity11 ? i do n’t know			0
‘ it was a genuine error on my part , the first in 32 years			1
but given today ’s unforgiving obsession with political correctness i have been compelled to pay a heavy price			0
’ the @entity2 said last night : ‘ at a local level , we got it wrong and we have offered mr @entity0 his job back			1
’ uncensored : @entity204 in concert many hit songs – often by rap artists – contain the ‘ n ’ word , but @entity2 producers usually use edits which censor the word			1
however , the @entity2 website is full of videos of artists using the term at live shows			2
@entity204 and @entity217 performed @entity218 [ the offensive word spelled with an ‘ a ’ rather than ‘ er ’ ] at @entity220 in @entity221 , @entity222 , in 2012 which aired live on @entity2			1
the online video features the stars using the n - word repeatedly without censorship			1
and last year , @entity2 6 music was criticised for editing the line ‘ one less white n * * * * * ’ from @entity230 ’s @entity229			2
@entity2 editorial guidelines say : ‘ strong language [ should be ] used only where it is editorially justified			2
’ after more than 32 years of programme - making , i have hung up my headphones for the last time			1
why ? because i made a silly mistake			2
[ and ] where political correctness is concerned there is no room for excuses or forgiveness			0
that said : let me stress here , i have no quarrel with anyone at the @entity2 in the @entity247 and @entity248			2
however , i do have issues with a repressive system that encourages wholly disproportionate reactions to innocent errors of judgment			0
on april 27 , i featured an 82 - year - old recording [ which ] includes one of today ’s ‘ forbidden ’ @entity257 language expressions … the ‘ n ’ word ! you ’ve got to listen very carefully to hear it but , yes , it is there on the recording			2
' an honour ' : mr @entity0 explained his ' silly mistake ' to his listeners online after he was stopped from doing so on air i was alerted to my error by @entity2 management who had , in turn , received a complaint from a listener , who , suffice it to say was ‘ horrified ’ by what he heard , and added , ‘ i hope that someone in authority will deal with mr @entity277 appropriately			1
’ ( he referred to me as @entity277 throughout )			0
i know of no other complaint			0
nevertheless , i admitted my mistake ; apologised to my managers , and offered to apologise to the listeners			1
alternatively , i offered to fall on my sword			1
a series of emails ensued			0
in the end , the @entity2 wrote to say , ‘ regrettably … we will have to accept your offer to fall on your sword			1
’ sadly , many thousands of @entity2 listeners have now been deprived of a programme they came to look forward to			2
this regrettable episode provides proof of the damaging effect political correctness in all its pernicious forms is having on @entity298 society			0
sorry folks , but i made a stupid mistake and i was left with no other option			0
it has been an honour to entertain you .			0
