the heartbreaking story of a baby boy who was found abandoned in a @entity3 drain has sparked renewed calls for baby safe havens to be introduced in @entity7			1
since the shocking incident emerged a woman has now been charged with attempted murder			0
she has been accused of leaving her son in a 2.4 metre - deep drain in @entity13 in @entity3 ’s west when he was just one day old			1
campaigners believe that this is another example of the need for ‘ baby hatches ’ that allow parents to safely place unwanted babies			1
@entity21 for @entity23 @entity22 , who has been pushing for their introduction in @entity7 for seven years , told @entity26 : ‘ i ’ve seen , read and cried over too many babies since 2007 , no more			1
a baby hatch is a place where people can bring babies , usually newborn ones , and leave them there anonymously to be found and cared for ‘ i do n’t know the details of this woman but for a lot of younger women , who hide their pregnancy and then deliver in a toilet , they need a lot of help and assistance			2
i think society owes them that , ’ she argued			0
so is rolling out a nationwide baby hatch scheme the best way to save abandoned children ? in @entity35 , @entity64 and @entity65 parents who do not want their child or can not care for them because of poverty or their own illnesses - such as post-natal depression - are able to leave them in a safe padded hatch			2
after two to three minutes an alarm is sounded to notify staff that a child has been dropped off , also giving the parents enough time to walk away anonymously and without fear of prosecution			1
@entity74 has gone so far as allowing a mother to leave her baby in hospital for adoption after giving birth without having to register as the mother			2
the storm drain , were a baby was found this weekend , was just large enough for the baby to fit through @entity84 , a law professor at the @entity85 at @entity86 , told @entity26 that while baby hatches are worth trialling in @entity7 they should not be ‘ a substitute for proper anti-natal and post-natal care and appropriate child protection measures generally ’			1
she pointed out that @entity7 has its own unique legal system – one that currently criminalises mothers who can not care for their children – and the country should run its own trials before introducing baby hatches nationwide			1
* 2013 baby left outside ambulance station in @entity102 , @entity103 * 2013 baby , nicknamed @entity105 , left outside a family 's home in @entity108 , @entity103 * 2011 baby @entity109 found dead in a @entity111 park , @entity23			1
* 2007 baby @entity112 left outside @entity114 hospital , @entity115 * 2007 baby @entity116 left on the doorstep of a @entity3 church she warned that the hatches would only potentially be beneficial if they did not cut funding from other services for mothers who are struggling			1
‘ there is a hypothetical pot of money and if it does n’t go to counselling it could jeopardise other lives			0
‘ but if baby hatches could be in addition to other services it is worth trialling			1
not nationally yet , that ’s overkill , but i would like to see a jurisdiction go ahead with it			0
‘ they would need an advertising campaign and social media so mothers knew it was available			0
then they could evaluate how much it was used			0
’ ms @entity84 said in essence she is in support of change : ‘ in case after case , women are quite overtly calling out for help … one women called parent helplines and said she ca n’t cope and “ i ca n’t be alone with my child ” , then she killed her baby and was convicted of murder			2
the @entity153 says there are baby boxes across @entity156 but @entity35 has the most with 99 across the country the hatch features padded walls and a blanket in the @entity35 centre ‘ that ’s a failure of the system in my opinion , she was ill and she needed help			0
’ ' we really need to be aware of the fact that the ones we see are the tip of the iceberg			0
we do n’t know what the other cases are , ’ she added			0
senator @entity22 goes even further in her belief that @entity7 needs to change the way it treats struggling parents and unwanted babies			1
she first heard about baby hatches in 2007 when her youngest daughter was pregnant			1
‘ she said “ mum you have to do something ” , she was watching a @entity182 show about abandoned babies			0
’ since then , senator @entity22 has visited hospitals in @entity35 and @entity188 and been moved by stories about abandoned babies left in plastic bags and in bushes in @entity7			1
@entity194 and his daughter @entity193 , 18 , identified the baby down the drain and contacted police workmen lift the 200kg concrete cover to the drain where the baby boy was dumped authorities are investigating the lead that the newborn boy was dropped from the height of 2.4m ‘ in @entity208 they have on average one baby a month that is relinquished and they have a specially appointed judge who adopts them out to loving families , ’ she explained			2
‘ there was the @entity217 baby left at a bus station in @entity115 who passers - by noticed but thought was a kitten , they did n’t realise it was a little boy			1
he lay in a morgue for two years before he could be buried , ’ she said of the baby she can not forget			0
‘ they are never going to take their first step , go to school , ride a bike … these women who are obviously desperate need another option			2
’ some fears about baby hatches are that they could encourage women to abandon their children but senator @entity22 said there is ‘ no evidence that there has been an increase ’ in the countries that currently use them			1
so far no @entity7 government has supported the hatches because they believe they are already doing enough for parents			1
people walk past next to a baby hatch named ' baby safety island ' at the @entity250 , in @entity252 municipality in @entity65 , a parent typically opens a door and places their infant in a small room , rings a bell and leaves before welfare services collect the child a mother weeps after leaving her child at the @entity263 baby hatch , one of 25 such hatch facilities in mainland @entity65 , spanning 10 provinces and major cities senator @entity22 argued that the scheme would be low cost if they attached the baby hatches to hospitals where the facilities to care for babies already exist			1
‘ you could have the legislation changed so these baby shoots can be in our hospitals , so there would be not any major costs just a case of changing laws so there are no prosecutions			0
‘ but we should n’t put a dollar figure on a baby ’s life			0
‘ we need to do more … we are a wealthy country and the extra money on baby hatches would be small			1
we need to reach out to these young girls and stop them giving birth in toilets			0
’ what both women agreed on is the fact mothers do n’t abandon their babies unless they are ‘ desperate ’			2
@entity299 , national president of the @entity301 and @entity302 at the @entity303 said that this most recent case of abandonment was a highly unusual case			0
in @entity65 , abandonment has been encouraged by the one - child policy and a traditional bias for sons , who support elderly parents and continue the family name , leading to the abandonment of girls ' parents abandoning their child is extremely rare in any situation			0
there would be less than ten cases of outright abandonment across @entity7 each year , but even among these this is highly unusual , ' ms @entity299 said			2
' babies are generally left on church doorsteps or at hospitals , in high - traffic areas where the parents know someone will find them and take care of them , ' she said			2
' typically , parents will abandon their baby because of a complete inability to take care of their child , and very often they are looking for someone else to care for child but do n't want to be investigated			2
' ' but this is quite a different scenario , and it 's clear they wanted the baby hidden			0
there must be some element of shame , where their families were n't aware they were pregnant , ' ms @entity299 said			0
' it has the hallmarks of mental illness or a serious drug addiction , and i ca n't think of another case like this			0

15 countries around the world provide baby hatches
they allow parents to give their baby up without fear of prosecution
fresh calls for them to be introduced in @entity7 come after a baby was left in a drain in western @entity3
@entity21 for @entity23 @entity22 says : ' these women who are obviously desperate need another option '
