when it became clear that @entity4 's second autobiography had reached the shelves early , two former @entity1 players got in touch to make enquiries			1
' what has he said about me ? ' was the rather anxious tone			2
as his first book told us 12 years earlier , when @entity4 cuts you , he cuts deep			1
@entity17 assistant manager @entity4 is all set to release his second autobiography this week the former @entity1 captain ( restrained by @entity20 and @entity21 ) wrote of problems with goalkeeper @entity23 @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 all go at @entity4 during a @entity28 in 2000 @entity4 ( right , alongside @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 ) opens up about difficulties he endured while at @entity34 this , however , is a different book to the first , a book with more layers , a book that reveals much more of @entity4 than perhaps we would ever have expected			1
the headline chapters are there in newsprint and we should n't be surprised			2
over the last decade or so , the 43 - year - old has lived a rich sporting life and the former @entity1 captain was always unlikely to leave scores unsettled			1
but beneath the froth and the cherry - picked anecdotes , @entity4 presents us with a remarkably complex self - portrait of a man for whom the closure of a playing career left him troubled , physically vulnerable and , most interestingly of all , scared			1
offered the chance to play for @entity54 in the wake of his exit from @entity1 in november 2005 , @entity4 actually took a call from @entity58 while he sat on the toilet but here the comedy ends			1
' i did n't go , ' @entity4 writes			1
' it was fear that decided me			2
' as usual , i was looking at what may go wrong			0
' hindsight is a f * * ker of a word			1
' keane with a @entity72 kit on - complete with baseball bat - and ( right ) sharing a joke with former @entity1 goalkeeper @entity75 sir @entity76 claps the @entity34 crowd after beating @entity4 's @entity78 in the @entity79 in september 2007 regrets apologising to @entity76 does not regret his tackle on @entity82 told @entity76 ' we need f * * * * * * more ' would n't have missed a drugs test like @entity86 @entity87 @entity23 class of 92 @entity54 regret @entity76 wanted me to wear no 7 turned down @entity91 this summer re-opens feud with @entity76 profited from @entity94 takeover ' @entity96 ' @entity95 suffered a heart attack @entity4 crosses line to dangerous territory on that mutv interview knew @entity101 would be one of the best @entity4 - proudly wearing the captain 's armband - in the driving rain at @entity105 against @entity106 in february 2004 keane all smiles with @entity108 shooting a tv commercial in @entity110 if his first book – memorable as it was – served to reinforce @entity4 's deliberately constructed image of driven , cold - eyed , one - track hard man , this one questions those stereotypes quite starkly			1
as he writes himself : ' my mid-life crisis has been going on for years '			0
some life decisions are taken on whims			0
for example , he accepted his first pundits gig with @entity122 after something he read in his horoscope			0
ultimately , though , tv work left him feeling ' like a failure ' , as did a brief foray on to the celebrity circuit after his sacking from @entity130			0
' playing football with f * * * * * g @entity131 , that was never my masterplan , ' he says			1
' i did n't like what i was becoming			0
' clearly , @entity4 's departure from @entity34 – and his manner of it – has stayed with him			1
he has tried to cut his emotional ties with the club but he has failed			0
similarly with his former manager sir @entity76			1
@entity4 is withering in his assessment of @entity76 , at times unstintingly so			1
he hints at selfishness and double standards in @entity34 's great patriarch			1
equally , though , the search for approval and recognition in a mentor goes on			0
after @entity4 's @entity78 team were drubbed 4 - 0 at home by @entity1 in 2007 , @entity76 offers him a player on loan			1
' it was the one time he showed me – i suppose – affection , ' @entity4 reflects			1
' he caught me off guard			0
i thought : " he actually cares , a bit "			0
' here , @entity4 points clearly to his own insecurity , vulnerability even			1
it is a theme of the book			0
the image of one of the great footballers of our time aimlessly kicking a ball against the inside of his garage door in @entity171 as he waited for the phone to ring @entity173 is a sombre one			0
meanwhile the one of @entity4 lying on his hotel bed in searing agony from his hip problem after refusing to admit he was n't ready to train on his first day at @entity91 points to a peculiar willingness to please			2
' i did n't want to let anyone down , ' he says			0
equally the admission that he never personalised his office at @entity78 is telling			0
at his rented flat in @entity184 he did n't have a tv and ate baked beans and pot noodles			0
' if things go badly i want to be able to clear it out quickly , ' he writes of his office in the north - east			2
ready for a quick getaway			0
' @entity4 ( centre ) pictured lining up for his local school in @entity194 as a young midfielder before being picked up by @entity196 there are two sides to @entity4 ( photographed in 1994 ) , who admitted in his book that he enjoyed working in tv punditry because of the company kept a fired - up @entity4 confronts @entity204 defender @entity203 during @entity207 's 2 - 1 @entity206 final defeat at @entity208 in 1991 @entity76 had a relationship that deteriorated with the @entity210 international while @entity1 continued to win major trophies @entity4 ( organising a wall to include @entity214 , @entity215 , @entity216 , @entity32 and @entity217 ) was disparaging towards his team - mates at @entity1 @entity4 writes about a range of topic in his @entity221 the first autobiography painted @entity4 as a loner who deliberately did n't have the mobile phone numbers of his @entity1 team - mates			1
this time , he emerges as fundamentally more sociable – albeit in his own way – and as a man who worried – and cared – much more about what team - mates and rivals thought of him than he ever let on			2
certainly , the presentation of @entity4 the worrier – worrying about retirement , his public image , his friends – is new			2
' over the years i have played different roles , ' he admits			0
' sometimes i do n't know what role i 'm supposed to be playing			0
' at @entity78 , it appears that he reconciled that dilemma , at least in part			0
for a time , he was successful			0
the essence of @entity4 remained – deliberately asking staff to set up a tactics boards at half - time so he could kick them over in ' rage ' – but subtleties emerged , too			1
ground staff were invited to eat with the players rather than in their old hut at the far end of the training ground , he used mental tricks to remember names of cleaning staff while he gave his own @entity258 medal in 2007 to a reserve goalkeeper who had n't qualified for one of his own			1
there are clear shades of @entity76 , here , of course			2
his shadow hangs over huge swathes of the book , whether @entity4 realises it or not			2
equally , there are pockets of ' old @entity4 ' too			2
his admission that he was briefly ' glad ' to hear one of his own players had suffered a heart attack while on loan at @entity275 – ' it would deflect from our own woeful performance that night ' – was something he may regret revisiting in print while his return to the @entity282 incident of lore feels gratuitous			0
there are , however , moments of splendid self - deprecation here			2
@entity4 tells how his first team - talk as manager of @entity78 focussed on a goalkeeper ' playing ' for the opposition who he had n't realised had been sold two weeks earlier			1
the first single he ever bought was @entity293 by @entity294 – maybe he should have left that bit out			0
certainly if @entity4 's first book – indeed his whole career – seemed designed to cultivated an image then this sequel has confronted , questioned and perhaps even dismantled it			1
it is this - the book 's great honesty - that makes it so worthwhile			2
' i have always been a bit wary and i hate that about myself , ' he admits			0
' when i was a player i shut doors on myself , now i do n't have to			0
