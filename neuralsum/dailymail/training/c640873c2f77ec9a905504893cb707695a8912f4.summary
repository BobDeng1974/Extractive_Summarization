by @entity0 published : 13:14 est , 15 september 2012 updated : 11:29 est , 26 september 2012 questions are being asked about the preparedness of the @entity4 @entity3 in @entity5 , after it was revealed that there were four attacks on diplomatic targets in the @entity11 city in the months leading up to the killing of the @entity4 ambassador on wednesday			1
despite president @entity15 's administration claiming that there was no ' actionable intelligence ' before the attack , on june 6th an ied was thrown at the perimeter of the @entity4 @entity3 in @entity5 and on august 5th , just over a month before the deadly assault an @entity23 building in the city was hit by rocket propelled grenades			1
' this ( the @entity4 consulate ) was a place that was targeted months before with an @entity29 ( improvised explosive device ) , ' said rep. @entity30 , chairman of the @entity32 intelligence committee who has been briefed on the attack and investigation			1
a protester holding his rifle during the assault on the @entity4 @entity3 in @entity5 , @entity11 on 11th september he told @entity39 , ' it 's clearly a target that they wanted to hit and they wanted to cause casualties			1
... it 's just too many coincidences here '			0
in addition , on june 11th the @entity49 ambassador 's motorcade was attacked by grenades , leaving two security personnel injured and on june 18th , armed gunmen attacked the @entity55 consulate and burned its flag			2
and on friday the chairman and a ranking member of the @entity62 homeland security comittee , @entity57 and @entity58 , issued a letter to the @entity65 inspector general requesting an investigation into the posture of the @entity4 consulate before the attack			1
the letter references the attack on the @entity49 ambassador in june			2
' does the risk assessment process consider the capacity or lack thereof of the host country to provide security ? ' says the letter			0
' did the @entity11 government request or suggest that security could be improved at the @entity5 facility prior to september 12th , 2010 ? ' four @entity4 citizens died in the attack on the consulate in @entity5 including the @entity4 ambassador @entity82 however , a spokesman for the @entity84 , repeated the claim that @entity4 officials in @entity11 were in the dark about the assault			1
' actionable intelligence would have meant that we either saw or heard something , through intelligence collection , that told us that a specific act was being planned or was imminent , ' said the spokesman			0
' as i have said , we are not aware of any actionable intelligence related to the attack in @entity5			2
' the @entity84 and the @entity98 did not comment when asked if the president was briefed on the four prior attacks before the deadly @entity5 attack			1
this comes as the @entity4 has announced it is sending more spies , @entity104 and drones to @entity11 , trying to speed the search for those who killed the @entity4 ambassador and three other @entity4 , but the investigation is complicated by a chaotic security picture in the post-revolutionary country and limited @entity4 and @entity11 intelligence resources			1
the @entity112 has fewer people available to send , stretched thin from tracking conflicts across the @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117			1
much of the team dispatched to @entity11 during the revolution had been sent onward to the @entity122 border , @entity4 officials say			2
destruction : a man walks in the rubble of the consulate after the attack that claimed four @entity4 and the @entity11 have barely re-established full control of their country , much less rebuilt their intelligence service , less than a year after the overthrow of dictator @entity132			1
the @entity4 has already deployed an @entity134 investigation team , trying to track @entity136 sympathizers thought to be responsible for turning a demonstration over an @entity139 video into a violent , coordinated militant attack on the @entity4 @entity3 in @entity5			1
ambassador @entity82 and three other embassy employees were killed after a barrage of small arms , rocket - propelled grenades and mortars tore into the consulate buildings in @entity5 on tuesday , the 11th anniversary of 9/11 , setting the buildings on fire			2
president @entity15 said in a @entity152 statement the morning after the attack that those responsible would be brought to justice			0
that may not be swift			0
building a clearer picture of what happened will take more time and possibly more people , @entity4 officials said friday , speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the ongoing investigation publicly			2
in a statement posted saturday on @entity168 militant websites , @entity136 's branch in @entity165 praised the killings and called for more attacks to expel @entity4 embassies from @entity168 nations , suggesting the terrorist organization is trying to co-opt the angry protests over a film produced in the @entity4 denigrating the @entity176			2
losses : @entity4 ambassador to @entity11 @entity82 , left , and former @entity179 , right , were killed during tuesday night 's attack gone : diplomat @entity181 , left , and @entity182 , right , were also killed in the melee intelligence officials are reviewing telephone and radio intercepts , computer traffic , satellite images and other clues from the days before the attacks — the kinds of material routinely gathered in a conflict zone where @entity136 affiliates are known to operate — and @entity11 law enforcement has made some arrests			1
but investigators have found no evidence pointing conclusively to a particular group or to indicate the attack was planned , @entity32 spokesman @entity197 said , adding , ' this is obviously under investigation			0
' early indications suggest the attack was carried out not by the main @entity136 terror group but ' @entity136 sympathizers , ' said a @entity4 intelligence official , speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the investigation publicly			2
one of the leading suspects is the @entity11 - based @entity168 militant group @entity213 , led by former @entity215 detainee @entity214			0
the group denied responsibility in a video friday but did acknowledge its fighters were in the area during what it called a ' popular protest ' at the consulate , according to @entity225 of the @entity226 , a private analysis firm that monitors @entity229 media for the @entity4 intelligence community			2
following the attacks on the @entity4 consulate the @entity112 and the military are increasing their presence in the region the @entity4 had been watching threat assessments from @entity11 for months but none offered warnings of the @entity5 attack , according to another intelligence official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about @entity4 intelligence matters			1
sen. @entity58 , @entity243 , questioned whether the consulate had taken sufficient security measures , given an attempt to attack the consulate in @entity5 a few months ago			1
@entity197 said that given the 9/11 anniversary , security had been heightened			0
' it was , unfortunately , not enough , ' he said			0
that paucity of resources also applies to the intelligence officers available to monitor @entity11 on the ground			0
with ongoing counterterrorism operations in @entity258 , @entity259 and @entity165 , as well as the civil war in @entity122 , the @entity112 's clandestine and paramilitary officer corps is simply running out of trained officers to send , @entity4 officials say , speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the deployment of intelligence personnel publicly			1
the clandestine service is roughly 5,000 officers strong , and the paramilitary corps sent to war zones is only in the hundreds , the officials said			0
@entity4 @entity104 carry the caskets during the transfer of remains ceremony yesterday marking the return to the @entity4 of the remains of the four @entity4 killed in an attack this week in @entity5 , @entity11 most of the @entity112 's clandestine and paramilitary team that had worked with @entity11 rebels to bring about the fall of @entity132 is now arrayed at the @entity122 border , working with rebels there to try to hasten the fall of @entity122 president @entity287 , the officials said			1
the @entity112 normally hires extra people to make up for such shortfalls , often retired special operators with the requisite security clearance , military training and language ability			2
but the government mandate to slash contractor use has meant cutting contracts , according to two former officials familiar with the agency 's current hiring practices			0
to fill in the gaps in spies on the ground , the @entity4 intelligence community has kept up surveillance over @entity11 with unmanned and largely unarmed predator and @entity308 drones , increasing the area they cover and the frequency of their flights since the attack on the consulate , as well as sending more surveillance equipment to the region , one official said			1
the bodies of @entity4 @entity181 , @entity317 , @entity182 and @entity82 were taken from a military transport plane as a military band played the victims of the attack in the @entity4 consulate in @entity11 are returned to @entity4 soil at @entity323 in @entity324 yesterday but intelligence gathered from the air still needs corroboration from sources on the ground , as well as someone to act on the intelligence to go after the targets			1
the @entity11 government , which @entity4 officials say is eager to help , has limited tools at its disposal			0
the post-revolution government has been slow to rebuild both its intelligence capability and its security services , fearful of empowering the very institutions they had to fight to overthrow @entity132			0
they have made a start , but they lack a sophisticated cadre of trained spies and a large network of informants			0
' the @entity11 in just about every endeavor are just learning to walk , let alone run , ' said @entity351 , a former senior @entity112 official and author of the book ' @entity354 and @entity4 @entity355			1
' ' there is confusion and competing elements within the new provisional government which complicates the task of creating new institutions , including the intelligence service , ' he said			0
@entity4 president @entity15 and secretary of state @entity365 return to their seats after speaking at the repatriation ceremony yesterday ' there are still some aspects of the intelligence services that still work , ' says @entity373 of the @entity374 think tank , including eavesdropping on cellphone calls and spying on computer traffic using equipment from the @entity132 era			0
@entity373 spent months with members of @entity11 's transitional government as they tried to rebuild the nation 's services and infrastructure			0
but the @entity11 have not yet even taken full command their own security services almost a year after @entity132 's fall , @entity373 said			0
that 's given the tens of thousands of militiamen who helped overthrow @entity132 the time they needed to organize and seek new targets , especially @entity395 ones , he said .			0

the @entity4 @entity3 in @entity5 was attacked on june 6th when an ied was thrown over the perimeter
following the june attack there were three other attacks on *western* diplomatic targets in @entity5 before the deadly assault on the @entity4 consulate
in response the @entity112 is sending unmanned drones to @entity116
