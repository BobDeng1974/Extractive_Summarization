by @entity0 published : 04:55 est , 3 february 2013 updated : 03:18 est , 4 february 2013 the young victim of an acid attack says she wanted to die when she first saw her disfigured face			1
@entity4 , 20 , was returning home from work at a @entity8 ’s secret store when she was attacked by a woman wearing a @entity11 niqab , which leaves only the eyes uncovered			1
she spent a month in a burns unit and , despite fears she had been blinded , has recovered sight in her left eye and partial vision in her right			1
last night she said : ‘ the first time i looked i was shocked			2
i did n’t want to live after i saw my face			1
shocked : @entity4 , 20 , said that she no longer wanted to live after she saw how her face had been burned in the acid attack attacked : miss @entity4 was walking home from her job at a @entity8 's @entity26 lingerie store when acid was hurled in her face brave : miss @entity4 has spoken out about her injuries to help police catch the veiled attacker ‘ my head was ten times the size , my face was black , my eyes were swollen and my eyes were cutting out			1
‘ i thought i was going to go blind			2
’ miss @entity4 was attacked after getting off a bus close to her home in @entity39 , @entity40 , shortly after midnight on 30 december			1
‘ i got off at the bus stop of my house and was about to cross the road , i felt a presence behind me so i decided to look back , ’ she told the @entity41			1
‘ i saw what seemed to be a lady wearing what i think is a hijab , which was mostly black			2
‘ i remember being startled and shocked , thinking i do n’t remember her getting off the bus with me , i did n’t hear footsteps behind me			2
the person was just staring back at me			2
' @entity4 , 20 , said : ' @entity54 has given me a life for a reason and that 's what keeps me going ' miss @entity4 said she then felt something being thrown at her : ‘ before i could feel it burning , i just knew it was acid , i thought ok someone is out to ... kill me			1
mystery : police have been unable to identify miss @entity4 's attacker because they were wearing a niqab ( file picture ) ‘ i have no clue why someone would do this to me			1
i still ask myself the same question every day , why me ? what have i done ? i did n’t understand			2
' that person failed , whatever their aim was , they failed			2
@entity54 has given me a life for a reason and that ’s what keeps me going			2
’ last night the mother of @entity84 ’s boyfriend @entity82 said she believes the attacker was specifically targeting her			2
@entity91 said : ‘ i do n’t think someone was hanging around , i think that someone was really targeting her			0
they were going for her			0
i ’m thinking it was somebody she knows or somebody who knows her that she does n’t know			0
‘ people think it ’s random , but i do n’t think it ’s random			0
people do n’t go about carrying acid in the middle of the night			0
‘ for them to have got it and then waited for a woman who is vulnerable , i think it is somebody who knows her rather than a random person			1
’ mrs @entity91 said @entity84 has not had difficulties in previous relationships or been in trouble in the past and is puzzled by the motive			0
she said : ‘ i do n’t know			0
she ’s quiet , she ’s a quiet girl			0
she goes to work and is home			1
‘ she is the sole carer for her mum so does n’t really go out a lot			0
she ’s home most of the time			1
’ mrs @entity91 added that @entity84 had raised concerns about returning home from her late shifts with her bosses			1
she said @entity84 was wearing her normal work clothes , but there was nothing to identify her as a @entity8 ’s @entity26 employee			0
she said : ‘ she ’s been complaining to her workplace about the late shifts			0
they do n’t dress proactively , they just dress casually			0
she was n’t carrying a @entity8 ’s secret bag			0
’ the @entity126 has said officers are keeping an open mind as to the motive			0
@entity4 was probably attacked with sulphuric acid , which can strip away outer layers of the skin within seconds and cause blindness if it enters the eyes			1
in 2008 , model @entity136 suffered horrific burns to her face and neck when she was attacked with the chemical			1
it burned through four layers of her skin , damaged her throat and left her blind in one eye			0
the attack was orchestrated by a jealous ex-boyfriend , @entity149 , who has since been jailed for life			0
the 29 - year - old model has had a series of skin grafts and operations to reconstruct her face			0
surgeons took tissue from her legs and buttocks and combined it with artificial skin to encourage healing			0
miss @entity4 will probably undergo similar treatment			1
devastating : ms @entity4 had just finished a shift at @entity165 shopping centre and was just minutes from home when the attack occurred			1

@entity4 , 20 , said she no longer wanted to live after seeing burns
she was walking home when she saw veiled woman and felt something thrown at her
@entity176 worker felt someone was ' out to kill her '
