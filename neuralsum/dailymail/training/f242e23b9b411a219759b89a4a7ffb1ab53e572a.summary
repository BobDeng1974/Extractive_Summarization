three women referred to in court had relationships with @entity2 who spent spent seven years living as a long - haired climber called @entity47			1

two other women had sexual relationships with a colleague of @entity2 's who claimed he was a truck driver called @entity64			1
@entity64 had taken part in ' deeply personal aspects of their lives ' , including attending the funeral of one woman 's father , the court heard			2

the tribunal is the only judicial body with the power to investigate the security services and was set up to consider public complaints about unreasonable surveillance			0
those appearing before it have fewer rights than in an ordinary court as there is no obligation to take oral evidence and the vast majority of hearings are held behind closed doors			1
it has upheld fewer than one in a 100 complaints since it was created in 2000 and complainants are allocated an advocate rather than choosing a lawyer			0
the tribunal is not required to give reasons for its judgments and there is no automatic right of appeal			0
the @entity16 argues that because the operations were authorised under the @entity141 ( @entity141 ) the claims should not be heard in an ordinary court			2

' @entity149 - @entity148 told mr. justice @entity150 : ' this case is not about denying remedy for any legitimate grievance			2
it is about the right forum for determining these claims			0

@entity256 , of @entity257 , said : ‘ these women are suing for a gross invasion of privacy and the @entity16 ’s response is to try and hive it off into a secret court			0
’ police say undercover officers were ‘ never authorised ’ to conduct sexual relationships , although a review has been set up to examine cases dating back to the 1980s			0
but senior officers admit they can not formally ban intimate contact because it would quickly become a ‘ litmus test ’ for people looking to identify police			0
