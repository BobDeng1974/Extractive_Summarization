divers have uncovered a preserved ' ghost ship ' in 2,000 feet of water nearly 20 miles off the coast of @entity4 in @entity5			0
sitting upright , its solitary mast still standing and the ship 's wheel still in place , the hulk of the former cable ship @entity8 , later the @entity9 , was found on the seabed			1
experts were stunned to find the ship was surprisingly intact for a vessel that was sunk with a torpedo			1
researchers from the @entity25 ( @entity26 ) and @entity28 's @entity27 today revealed the ship was found by a robotic submersible			0
' it is always a thrill when you are closing in on a large sonar target with the @entity36 submersible and you do n't know what big piece of history is going to come looming out of the dark , ' said @entity40 , the submersible pilot			0
' one of our first views of the @entity9 was the classic helms wheel on the fantail			2
' the ship was surprisingly intact for a vessel that was sunk with a torpedo			2
' the upper deck structures from the bow to the stern were well - preserved and showed no sign of torpedo damage			2
' ' from her interisland service to her role in @entity56 communications and then @entity57 , @entity8 today is like a museum exhibit resting in the darkness , reminding us of these specific elements of @entity56 history , ' said @entity63			1
' seeing the ship come into view , we were all amazed at its level of preservation - and by the fact that everything was more or less in place			0
launched in @entity72 , @entity73 in early 1923 for the @entity74 , @entity8 was a vital part of a global network of submarine cable that carried telecommunications around the world			1
when the cable reached @entity5 for the first time in 1901 , it was a major step in establishing not only a key link in the network , but also in connecting the islands to the rest of the world with near - instant communication			1
@entity8 arrived in @entity5 and started work in july of that year			2
repairing cable and carrying supplies , @entity8 served the remote stations at @entity93 and @entity94 from 1923 until 1941			1
the famous battle of @entity93 , off the atoll 's shores in 1942 saw it take on a new role as a warship			0
@entity8 , now chartered by the @entity101 , entered service as @entity9 ( ix - 71 ) to service cable and submarine nets in the @entity56 until it returned to @entity106 at the end of the war			1
no longer needed by the @entity101 or the @entity109 , the former @entity9 was sunk as a target by submarine torpedo fire on february 7 , 1946			1
the exact location was not recorded , and the final resting place of the ship had remained a mystery			1
' the identification of the wreck was easy , not only because of its unique form , but also because the @entity101 's identification number of @entity120 was still painted on the bow , ' said @entity122 , director of the @entity123			0
detailed analysis of sonar surveys of the sea floor off @entity4 by @entity127 and @entity40 of @entity128 has found a number of significant , previously uncharted wrecks that remained unidentified until encountered by @entity128 's @entity36 submersibles			0
these have included the @entity134 midget submarine sunk in the opening hour of the attack on @entity106 , and the massive aircraft carrier submarines @entity138 and @entity139			1
the ships copntrol system was found nearby			0
the @entity9 wreck is now considered an historic site			2
the @entity9 wreck is considered an historic site			0
' we plan to nominate the wreck to the @entity145 , ' noted @entity122			0
' this unique @entity147 ship , vital in its role in keeping global telecommunications open in the first part of the 20th century , is also linked to historically significant @entity151 , now part of @entity153 in the @entity154			1
wrecks such as this remind us of special places in the ocean , like the monument , that connect all of us to them as refuges , sanctuaries and museums beneath the sea			0
' there are no plans for a return to the site or any recovery ; the wreck owned by the @entity171 and is protected as @entity172 .			0
