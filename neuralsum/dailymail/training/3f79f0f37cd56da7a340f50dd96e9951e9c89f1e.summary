so at the end of the breeding season i set about feeding a particular pair near me			2
' i started off feeding them mice then chicks every night and they eventually became so accustomed to me that they would follow me down the valley when they saw me coming			0
' barn owls are naturally quite wary of people so it surprised me but they became quite used to me , especially the male			0
the male owl , pictured tucking into one of mr @entity6 's meals , even landed on his head as they made their way to the area to have their picture taken in the @entity30 valleys barn owls had a dismal breeding season last year and mr @entity6 wanted to do what he could to help them out ' i watched them over a period of months and gradually knew what they would do and how i could best capture them in action but it does look as if they are posing for the pictures			1
