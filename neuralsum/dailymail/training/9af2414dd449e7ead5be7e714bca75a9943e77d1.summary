foreigners will be banned from entering @entity1 unless they have health insurance , under @entity4 plans announced today			1
@entity4 leader @entity5 set out a raft of new policies on improving the nation 's health , including more dementia funding , scrapping hospital parking charges and hiring more nurses , midwives and gps			1
but the party 's health spokesman has faced questions about whether mr @entity5 's reputation for smoking and posing drinking beer in pubs is the best advertisement for a healthy lifestyle			1
in doing so , however , it will inevitably open itself up to greater scrutiny by the media and by its political rivals			0
a flagship policy will be forcing migrants , students and visitors to show they have approved medical insurance before they are allowed into @entity1 as part of the crackdown on ' health tourism '			1
the party 's health spokesman @entity48 will claim the move will stop up to £ 2billion being lost every year because of foreigners using the @entity27 to get treatment or prescriptions			1
in a speech unveiling the party 's plans for the health service today , the @entity54 will warn ' it 's the @entity27 itself that needs emergency care and nursing back to health '			2
under the plans , foreigners will only be entitled to free healthcare after they have contributed through taxation for five years			0
it would apply to anyone wanting to come to @entity1 if it is outside the the @entity32			1
mr @entity5 has previously suggested a move towards an insurance based health system , but miss @entity48 said yesterday there will be ' absolutely not a whiff of privatisation ' in the proposals			2
today the @entity4 leader hit out at @entity79 claims that the party backed privatisation			1
he said : ' @entity4 is committed to an @entity27 that is free at the point of access and paid for out of taxation , full stop			2
' but just because we believe in the @entity27 it does n't mean we ca n't be critical of certain aspects of it			0
certainly what we have seen over the last few years is a huge increase in money but not always a compensating increase in productivity			0
' @entity4 leader @entity5 set out his party 's health policies , but questions have been raised about his own unhealthy habits like drinking and smoking the party said it will use £ 200million of the saving to end hospital car parking charges in @entity105			1
explaining the proposals to make health insurance mandatory for foreigners , miss @entity48 told @entity110 on @entity111 : ' i think as @entity1 when we go abroad , if we travel abroad as a visitor or worker , i think @entity1 as a matter of course purchase life insurance or medical insurance or baggage insurance , i think it 's something that we do quite naturally , we do n't even think about it			1
' what we are saying is , what is the problem in asking people to do exactly the same when they come here ? so if you are a migrant worker or a visitor or a student , you should have medical insurance , that is absolutely fundamental			0
' i think the easiest way to do that , it should be a condition of entry into the country through the visa process			0
' @entity4 will also pledge to provide an extra 20,000 nurses , 3,000 midwives and 8,000 gps through an annual £ 3billion funding boost for the @entity27 it says will be paid for with savings made by leaving the @entity32			1
the focus on health pits @entity4 against @entity79 , which has vowed to make the @entity27 a central feature of its election campaign			2
but mr @entity5 's image as a smoker and drinker appears at odds with the idea of putting him in charge of the nation 's health			2
challenged about her leader 's unhealthy habits , miss @entity48 admitted that the party had to focus on ' prevention ' of drink and smoking - related illnesses			1
she told @entity111 : ' well @entity5 obviously went all of january without one drink entirely … but seriously , absolutely , we have to look at prevention			0
' i think that 70 per cent of things that are treated on the @entity27 are preventative			0
we have to look at how we put out a really good positive message , however does that mean that i believe in a nanny state where we order people not to drink ? ' you know , people , we are adults , we must make our own choices and i think that 's very important but absolutely , we have to look at that kind of thing , prevention			0
obesity as well is obviously a big one that we 're going to have to look at			0
' @entity4 health spokesman @entity48 said mr @entity5 had managed to give up drinking for january , but conceded that the party 's policy had to focus on preventable illnesses miss @entity48 , a former actress , added that she has a ' unique view ' on the @entity27 , because she has never worked in healthcare			1
she said : ' i think that actually gives me a unique view because i am looking at it from the same as everybody else , the users ' point of view and what the people want			0
' mr @entity5 used his speech to set out @entity4 's plans to invest an additional £ 3billion in front - line @entity27 services			1
among the measures to be unveiled is a commitment to invest £ 650million in dementia research over the lifetime of the parliament - more than double the amount pledged by @entity202 at the weekend			0
under the party 's plans , the @entity204 watchdog would be abolished and responsibility for hospital inspections passed to local health boards which would be encouraged to take evidence from whistle - blowers and patients with grievances			1
hospital managers would have to be licensed in the same way as doctors and nurses in a move which the party says is designed to ' negate the drift ' of disgraced hospital managers who are fired from one job only to take up another elsewhere in the @entity27			2
tuition fees for medical students would be scrapped on what the party says would be a means - tested basis , and less highly qualified state enrolled nurses ( @entity231 ) reintroduced in a drive to encourage more ' home - grown medical talent '			0
the party also says that merging health and social care would be a priority , with funding for social care for the elderly raised to £ 1 billion a year			2
labour frontbencher @entity242 said : ' @entity4 has a long - standing record of support for increased @entity27 privatisation and @entity27 charging			0
' @entity5 has made clear that he personally believes in increased @entity27 privatisation , so a single speech can not hide their real agenda			0

foreigners would need health insurance before being allowed into @entity1

claims leaving the @entity32 would pay for more nurses , midwives and @entity265
