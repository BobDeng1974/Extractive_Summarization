he was only 15 when the @entity1 broke out and ten days later he was aboard the cruiser @entity3 , heading for the coast of @entity5			1
but when the small naval squadron commanded by rear - admiral sir @entity10 met a far bigger @entity12 force at the @entity13 in 1914 , young naval cadet @entity7 's early taste of action would be his last			1
ablaze at night and crippled by enemy shells , the @entity14 was caught in the spotlight of the @entity12 cruiser @entity18 , which was hoping she would strike her colours and surrender			1
a young @entity7 who was just 15 when he went to war aboard the @entity3 , his posthumously awarded @entity22 ( right ) was lost for decades before turning up at an auction last year but instead the stricken vessel , with the @entity26 teenager on board , turned towards the enemy – who then fired into the @entity3 until she capsized , taking all 735 souls on board to a watery grave			1
@entity7 's heartbroken parents @entity33 and @entity34 received a brutally succinct telegram from the @entity36 – ' regret that loss @entity14 with all on board must now be presumed ' – and their son 's posthumous @entity22			2
but the precious medal passed out of the family 's hands and for decades they believed it to be lost – until suddenly it turned up at an auction last year			1
it was purchased for a three - figure sum by @entity50 - based @entity49 medals collector @entity48 , who understood it had been given up by the family			2
but now it will be coming home after he agreed to sell it for what he paid at auction			0
@entity7 's niece @entity58 , 77 , had heard about the sale and contacted auctioneer @entity61 , offering to buy it back			2
she said : ' it was an emotional moment when i first saw the medal and saw @entity7 's name inscribed around the edge			1
all my family are thrilled about this			0
' the doomed @entity3 , a @entity71 - built cruiser which was sunk at the @entity13 by @entity12 vesel @entity18 which fired on it until it capsized the medal will now be taken by @entity7 's family to a december 8 memorial service in @entity50 , marking the centenary of the @entity79 defeat at the @entity13 and the @entity49 's subsequent victory at the @entity81			1
the @entity13 took place on 1 november 1914 off the coast of central @entity5			0
a @entity49 squadron , led by rear - admiral sir @entity10 , were defeated by @entity86 forces			0
two @entity49 armoured cruisers were destroyed and 1,570 men killed in the battle			0
only three men were injured on enemy forces			0
it was @entity79 's first naval defeat since the @entity94 in 1812 and shock at home to the defeat led to the sending of more ships			2
these ships later destroyed the @entity12 naval forces at the @entity81			2
the medal will then return to @entity26 where it will remain in the care of @entity7 's great - nephew @entity101			1
mr @entity48 , a company director , said : ' i was drawn to this medal because @entity7 was so young			1
he was one of the youngest people to be killed during the @entity1			0
' it is a highly emotive medal			0
i was very surprised to hear from the family			0
' i have been collecting for a long time and this has never happened to me before			0
but as far as i was concerned , there was no doubt that , if the family wanted it back , it should be returned to them			0
' a few day 's after the death of former @entity117 pupil @entity7 , his father received a letter from a @entity119 , from @entity26 , who had also lost a son in the war			1
it prompted mr @entity7 to reply : ' it was most kind of you to write such a nice letter of sympathy to us about our little sailor ... since the sad news came to us , we have had a letter six weeks old from the boy and it has cheered us up a little because he was so happy and getting on so well			2
