by @entity0 published : 04:06 est , 3 may 2013 updated : 04:11 est , 3 may 2013 bungling workmen painted yellow zig zag lines outside a former school without realising that it had closed and been demolished four years ago			1
the contractors seemingly did n't notice that they were painting ' school ' on the road next to an empty field in @entity9			1
the council closed @entity11 in 2008 because there were too few children , and it was demolished a year later			1
blunder : @entity15 painted yellow zig - zag lines on the road outside this empty field four years after the school was demolished in @entity9 roadworkers were instructed to paint the lines by the local authority and they diligently did the job without realising anything was wrong			1
it is believed the contractors were given an out of date list of sites that needed painting - and simply did away and did what they were told			0
they are thought to have painted a number of other lines around the town which were n't needed			2
@entity36 , spokeswoman at @entity37 , which carried out the work , said : ' the road markings have been painted by mistake			2
they will be removed when our workers are next in the area			2
' one local resident said : ' we wondered what was going on when the workmen turned up			0
we could n't believe it when we came home later on and saw the markings had been redone			0
mistake : the council will now send workman back to remove the freshly - painted yellow warning lines ' that road can be busy but i do n't think there is much chance of any pupils crossing it to get to the school anytime soon			1
it 's a bit of a joke really			0
' the site has been earmarked for an extra care housing scheme for older people , scheduled to open in 2015			0
councillor @entity66 said : ' i was made aware of the road markings and i reported it to the council 's highways department as soon as i found out			0
' highways officers admitted it was their error , not the contractors , and have told me they will sort it out			0
' empty field : @entity11 , in @entity9 , was demolished around a year after it closed in 2008 because of low pupil numbers			1

school in @entity9 was *shutdown* in 2008 and demolished a year later
but that did n't stop workman drawing lines on the road anyway
@entity85 say they will be removed at the next opportunity
