by @entity0 young women aged between 18 and 24 are going broke twice as fast as young men , it was revealed yesterday			2
and experts say many women are building up debts they can not repay to pursue a celebrity lifestyle			2
they are buying designer clothes and other expensive goods as they try to emulate the rich and famous			0
new figures from the @entity12 show how among the under 35s , women are more likely to go bust than men reality tv star @entity17 last year filed for bankruptcy for a second time in five years while @entity20 was also declared bankrupt last year the scale of the financial problems facing women emerged yesterday in official figures on personal insolvency			1
they highlight an extraordinary social change in @entity28 from a time when an insolvent woman in her 20s was a rarity to today ’s debt explosion			2
aggressive advertising campaigns by payday loan companies which encourage women to spend on luxuries also came in for criticism			0
the @entity12 ’s figures show that last year 7.8 women aged 18 to 24 became insolvent for every 10,000 adults compared with a rate of 4.0 for men			1
more women than men were also going bust in the 25 - 34 age group , although the difference was not so stark			1
the personal insolvency rate for women was 32.8 per 10,000 adults last year , while for men it was 25.6			1
the figures , for @entity53 and @entity54 , show that around 14,730 women aged 18 and 34 were overwhelmed by their debts last year , compared with around 10,950 men			1
the gender gap is most striking in the @entity59 , where almost 14 in 10,000 women aged under - 25 are insolvent , compared to 5.5 for men high profile young women who have been unable to pay their debts include former @entity64 actress @entity20 , declared bankrupt last year , and the singer @entity17 , who last year filed for bankruptcy for the second time in five years			1
the figures also show that when all age groups are taken into account women are for the first time just as likely as men to become insolvent			1
for every 10,000 adults 22.6 men became insolvent last year			1
for women , the figure was virtually identical at 22.2			0
in 2009 , the insolvency rate for men was 35.5 per 10,000 adults , whereas for women it was 26.0			1
yesterday experts predicted women will ‘ beat ’ men of all ages within a few years , a dubious landmark for those whose grandmothers were not even allowed to take out a mortgage in their own right			2
@entity86 , a council member for the insolvency professionals ’ trade body @entity88 , said the larger numbers of young women going insolvent compared with men is in part likely to be a hangover from the pre-credit crunch era when people were making their incomes stretch further by taking out credit			1
‘ i think it is the differences in spending patterns nowadays for that age group , ’ she said			0
‘ lifestyles have changed a great deal in the last 20 years			0
’ she also suggested that celebrity culture may be having some influence on spending habits , with people trying to imitate a lifestyle few can actually afford			0
@entity110 struggle : coastal areas suffer from higher insolvency rates , the new research suggests experts say changing lifestyle patterns and a hangover from the financial crisis mean young women are more willing - and able - to take on debts the 10 local authorities with the highest personal insolvency rates across @entity53 and @entity54 in 2013 , with the rate per 10,000 adults : 1			1
@entity131 , 39.3 @entity132 , chief executive of the @entity133 , said : ‘ the credit landscape is changing rapidly , with marketers becoming a lot more targeted and using mobile , social media and online advertising to promote borrowing and spending			2
payday and other short - term lenders are working hard to look more responsible			0
’ he said the rise in female insolvency is ‘ the inevitable outcome of the expansion of credit marketing ’ , adding : ‘ taking out credit is now perceived as a right , with the responsibilities pushed to one side			2
’ personal insolvencies are made up of bankruptcies , debt relief orders and individual voluntary arrangements , where money is shared out between creditors			0
many go for @entity159 , which were established in 1986 as an alternative for individuals wishing to avoid bankruptcy			0
they are a formal repayment proposal presented to a debtor ’s creditors via an insolvency practitioner and are seen by many as an option that does not attract the same stigma as a bankruptcy hearing			0
the increase in female insolvency has also been fuelled by the introduction of debt relief orders in 2009			0
they are only an option for people who have debts of less than £ 15,000 , who have almost no assets , who can not pay their debts and who have no prospect of their situation improving .			0

experts blame changing lifestyles and a hangover from the credit crunch
