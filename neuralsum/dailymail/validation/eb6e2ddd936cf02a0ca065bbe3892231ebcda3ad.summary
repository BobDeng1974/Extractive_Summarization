a video has been released which appears to show @entity1 being knocked out cold by former @entity3 team - mate @entity2			1
the @entity5 captain and the @entity7 defender pulled on gloves during a night - in at @entity1 's @entity10 mansion last month - but @entity2 's wife @entity11 dismissed the incident as a joke			1
with only a small space in which to work in @entity1 's lounge , the pair trade light blows for just under a minute before @entity2 sends @entity1 reeling			1
the @entity19 striker lies motionless under a chair for several seconds before the video , obtained by @entity22 , cuts out			1
@entity1 , a big boxing fan , posted this picture on his @entity24 with professional boxer @entity25 @entity2 's wife @entity11 moved to defuse the furore by claiming the video had been a joke ' @entity1 had everybody worried when he hit the floor like that , ' a source told the newspaper			1
' he made such a thud when he went down and he was just on his back with his eyes closed , not moving			0
' people were scared he had really banged his head and done some lasting damage			0
' everyone realised it was a stupid thing to do , but they just got carried away			0
' @entity2 's wife @entity11 later hit back at the furore caused by the release of the video			1
she tweeted : ' seen the sun , 2 mates havin a laugh video does n't show @entity1 jumping straight up and laughing with @entity49			2
' the video is believed to have been filmed on february 22 , the day after @entity3 lost 2 - 1 at @entity51			1
@entity1 is wearing a pair of white @entity54 gloves while @entity2 pulls on a pink pair			1
they appear to be sparring gloves rather than the smaller , less padded sets worn in professional fights			0
neither man has a headguard on and while @entity2 is wearing shoes , @entity1 is in his socks			1
after touching gloves , they circle each other before @entity2 throws a left hand			2
@entity1 paws back without connecting			2
@entity2 is the more aggressive throughout , and tries to go for @entity1 's body , pushing him back			1
the pair separate but again @entity2 comes on strongly , landing a right uppercut			2
@entity1 tries to respond but misses wildly before his former team - mate bides his time and throws the shot that sends @entity1 backwards , narrowly avoiding a chair as he hits the deck			0
the incident could leave @entity1 with some uncomfortable questions to answer from @entity3 chiefs over his choice of extra-curricular activities			1
given he skipper 's @entity3 , the forward is a regular for @entity85 's men			2
and the @entity3 manager is unlikely to be impressed with @entity1 for partaking in such dangerous activities prior to matches and training			1
@entity1 returned to action six days later , scoring a double against @entity92			0

' when asked by one @entity114 user whether he would consider fighting @entity1 for charity , @entity105 replied : ' when he wakes up maybe '			1
@entity1 comes from a big boxing background and is often photographed at ringside during high - profile bouts			2
speaking seven years ago , @entity1 said his boxing training as a youngster helped his football career			2
' i think my boxing training was beneficial in my development as a footballer , especially breaking through to the @entity135 at such a young age , ' he said			0
' i needed that extra bit of strength that the boxing training had given me			0
it made it easier to play than it might have been and it 's helped me with the way my game is now			0
' all through my life - from the ages of six , seven and eight - when big fights were on television , i used to stay up with my dad to watch them			0
