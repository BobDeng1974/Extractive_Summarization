by @entity0 published : 13:55 est , 9 october 2013 updated : 14:46 est , 9 october 2013 a southern @entity2 boy returned home this week from the hospital after a terrifying ordeal with a flesh - eating bacteria that doctors feared would kill him			1
@entity9 , an eighth - grader at @entity10 near @entity11 , was playing tag at school on september 18 when he cut his knee			1
what initially appeared to be ' no big deal ' became far worse			0
@entity9 's leg began to swell , and ct scans showed the infection had spread to his abdomen and chest , the @entity17 reported			1
@entity9 contracted the same flesh - eating bacteria that caused @entity24 to have her limbs amputated doctors in @entity2 quickly flew him to @entity27 in @entity28 , where he was diagnosed with necrotizing fasciitis			1
the boy , who is a runner , could have lost his leg , but doctors did n't amputate because they did n't expect him to live , his mother @entity30 said			1
@entity9 defied their expectations and is projected to make a complete recovery after arriving home in @entity36 on monday			1
he 'll be taking antibiotics every day , and he 'll get his stitches out from his surgery in two or three weeks			0
doctors in @entity2 quickly flew @entity9 to @entity27 in @entity28 for treatment necrotizing fasciitis , more commonly known as ' flesh - eating disease ' , is a rare but extremely vicious bacterial infection			1
' @entity44 ' refers to something that causes body tissue to die , and the infection can destroy skin , muscles and fat			2
the disease develops when the bacteria enters the body , often through a minor cut or scrape			2
as the bacteria multiply , they release toxins that kill tissue and cut off blood flow to the area			2
because it is so virulent , the bacteria spreads rapidly throughout the body			0
symptoms include small , red lumps or bumps on the skin , rapidly - spreading bruising , sweating , chills , fever and nausea			0
organ failure and shock are also common complications			0
sufferers must be treated immediately to prevent death , and are usually given powerful antibiotics and surgery to remove dead tissue			0
amputation can become necessary if the disease spreads through an arm or leg			0
but about a quarter of victims will lose their lives to the disease			0
' whatever they say , we are going to do it and be thankful , ' @entity30 said			0
necrotizing fasciitis is a bacterial infection most commonly carried by a cough or sneeze from someone carrying the group a strep bacteria - the same one that causes common strep throat - which can then be transmitted to an open wound by touch			1
typically , people who are most at risk have weakened immune systems			0
that 's one of the confounding details about @entity9 's case , he was in seemingly perfect health , an active cross-country runner for his school			1
@entity11 dermatologist @entity110 did not see or treat @entity9 but is familiar with necrotizing fasciitis , having seen the condition personally twice in his career			1
he said @entity9 's parents made the right move , to seek help quickly			2
doctors were also to be commended , @entity110 added			0
' the disease is easy to misdiagnose			0
it may start with a red spot on the skin , ' @entity110 said			0
' the infection goes deeper beneath the skin and can move relatively quickly and get serious fast			0
' @entity9 had the same infection that fellow flesh - eating bacteria survivor @entity24 almost lost her life to			1
@entity127 received huge media attention for her recovery after suffering life - changing injuries which led to her limbs being amputated			1
@entity24 was injured on may 1 last year when she traveled down a homemade zipline that snapped , sending her into a lake on the @entity135 near @entity136			2
a cut on her left leg from rocks in the water became infected with necrotizing fasciitis			1
@entity24 , left , with her parents , @entity143 and @entity144 , outside @entity145 in @entity146 , @entity147 , in june 2012 , after her amputations			2

@entity9 contracted the bacteria after cutting his knee at school in @entity2
necrotizing fasciitis is the same bacteria that infected @entity24 - who had her limbs amputated because of it
doctors did n't amputate his leg because they *thought* he *'d* die
@entity9 returned home on monday and will make a full recovery
