despite being an @entity2 gold medalist , tv presenter and fitness fan , i do n’t want to always look like i ’ve just jumped off the cross trainer ( even if i have )			1
tracksuits are far from flattering and , as a busy mother - of - three , i still want to look presentable as i dash from workouts to the school run , a meeting , or the supermarket			1
for years , i carried bulky bags full of training kit but , nowadays , i like to travel light , so i always keep an eye out for functional , transitional sportswear that looks stylish at both a ‘ body pump ’ class and the school gates			1
luckily , we ’re seeing something of a sportswear explosion on the @entity24			1
fuelled by the popularity of yoga and @entity28 , gym kits are having a major makeover			2
never before has workout gear looked so unlike the scratchy tracksuits i wore as a young athlete in the early nineties			1
luxury website @entity35 launched net - a - sporter this year , selling designer tank tops , leotards and even tennis skirts			1
and since sportswear makes up 27 per cent of the £ 26 billion @entity42 fashion industry , jogging bottoms have never been hotter			1
but the trick is to buy items that do n’t look like @entity47 kit , so they can be worn to the gym and out for dinner			1
to prove how easily it can be done , i put some of the most versatile sportswear available through its paces			1
once i did , i was less impressed			2
too baggy for workouts but not tapered enough to make them flattering , they hover in @entity63			2
i personally would n’t buy them			1
2/5 floral luxe trousers , £ 95 , sweatybetty.com sleeveless jacket , £ 49.99 , zara.com @entity68 shirt , £ 35 , debenhams.com @entity70 suede court shoe , £ 69 , houseoffraser.co.uk @entity71 gap does a brilliant , affordable sports range called @entity74 that i buy loads from and mix with everyday staples like jeans			1
i ’d live in this jumper			0
it ’s made from light fabric , so you can pull it on after a gym session without overheating			0
it ’s not branded so it would work for formal events , glammed up with heels and smart trousers			0
5/5 ribbed gym sweater , £ 29.95 , gap.co.uk red trousers , £ 49 , jaeger.co.uk leopard print court shoes , £ 130 , and clutch bag , £ 85 , duoboots.com @entity95 there ’s not much room to hide in this leotard			0
i preferred to pin the low v - neck , but for the ladies who dare , i say go for it , though you could wear a vest underneath for modesty			1
you have to be quite self - assured to wear something this skintight			1
shoulder ruching adds structure and the shape is elegant and glamorous			0
no one would have a clue it ’s sportswear — it ’s certainly more for parties than @entity28			1
3/5 ballet bodysuit , £ 55 , @entity116 floral pencil skirt , £ 45 , marksand @entity118 @entity120 sandals , £ 110 , ninewest.co.uk yoga bottoms i tend to do high - intensity workouts where i push myself and sweat a lot			2
these might be problematic as the fabric is far from breathable — i ’d have to stick to gentler yoga			0
having said that , i love the shape			0
they are form - fitting , but not tight , and well - tapered , so show off my ankles			2
the fabric ’s sheen elevates them from traditional jogging bottoms and , worn with a sparkly jacket , they look like tuxedo - style trousers			2
i ’d wear these to a formal event			0
3.5/5 joggers , £ 28 , @entity116 @entity141 by @entity143 sequin jacket , £ 199 , @entity144 silk top , £ 29.50 , marks @entity146 shoes , £ 24.99 , newlook.com @entity148 i love this pattern , it ’s vampy , fits like a dream and i could wear it with jeans or running leggings			0
the high , wide back means you can wear a bra without the straps showing			0
as an athlete sponsored by @entity159 , i was often sent lovely things — and @entity161 for @entity159 is a match made in heaven			0
4/5 @entity161 for @entity159 top , £ 40 , harrods.com leather skirt , £ 189 , reiss.com shoe boots , £ 38 , next.co.uk @entity167 at first i was sceptical			0
the baggy crotch and three - quarter length gave a strange shape and the colours looked too psychedelic to carry off anywhere but a dance studio			2
teamed with a tailored blazer and plain white top the trousers were transformed			0
modern , elegant and fun			0
3.5/5 trousers , £ 65 , sweatybetty.com @entity179 , £ 35 , marksandspencer.com @entity180 , £ 79.99 , zara.com courts , £ 70 , @entity144			0
