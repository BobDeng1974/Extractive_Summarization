by @entity0 for @entity1 once , to be 21 was to stand on the threshold of adulthood			1
in the words of the music hall song 21 today , you got the key of the door and the chance to do just what you liked			1
these days , for many , it barely has even symbolic significance			1
but to television producer @entity14 it ’s a hugely important landmark – because the generation of children whose lives she started to document at the turn of the millennium – when they were seven – are now 21			1
tonight , in the documentary @entity19 : @entity21 ( tonight and tomorrow at 10.35pm @entity22 ) , she revisits her proteges to discover how their lives have changed now that they ’re no longer teenagers			1
all change : @entity28 is now working as a sports trainer despite battling with cerebral palsy and the decency , humour and sheer determination she uncovers among today ’s young people will be an inspiration , and perhaps a surprise , to many viewers			1
she returns to catch up with youngsters such as @entity28 , who despite his cerebral palsy is working as a sports trainer , and jazz singer @entity43 , a committed @entity44 who intends to remain a virgin until she marries			1
‘ it ’s a wonderful thing to be involved in , ’ says @entity14 , ‘ a huge privilege , and a huge commitment in a way that nothing else ever could be			1
’ she started work on the series in the late 90s after working as a researcher with veteran documentary maker @entity55			1
his seminal programmes , returning every seven years to chart the lives of a group of 1960s schoolchildren , have now been running for half a century : in 2012 , the latest installment , @entity62 , was broadcast			1
@entity63 plans : committed @entity64 has ambitions to become an opera singer now she is 21 tres bien : @entity67 is now studying in @entity68 and has a boyfriend who she sees every five weeks @entity14 was inspired to do the same for the 21st century , despite @entity55 ’s warning : ‘ it will become a much bigger part of your life than you could ever have imagined			1
’ she ’s only now beginning to understand how true that is			1
‘ i feel a responsibility akin to being thir parent , ’ she says , ‘ even though we do n’t experience day - to - day life with each other			1
they feel like my extended family			1
’ the 14 youngsters were picked from across the social spectrum			1
some , like @entity87 and @entity88 , come from wealthy families – both went to leading public schools and are now studying abroad			2
brimming with confidence , @entity87 announces , ‘ for the next ten to 15 years i ’ll be going crazy to accomplish my goals			2
’ she has a boyfriend , but he ’s in @entity95 and she ’s at university in @entity68 : they see each other about once every five weeks , and that ’s how she likes it			1
@entity101 , a criminology student in @entity102 , takes a very different attitude to her life			2
touching scenes with her boyfriend @entity106 , including the moment when he helps her to cut her 21st birthday cake , show they are very much in love			2
@entity101 was left with limited mobility by a virus when she was two years old			2
her disability has helped to make her confident and upfront with others			2
‘ if i ’m open about my condition , people are more willing to help , ’ she told me cheerfully this week			2
‘ if i ’m not embarrassed , nobody else is			2
’ for an older generation , the intrusion of a camera crew and two days of intense personal questions from the filmmakers might seem an unwelcome invasion of privacy			2
but these youngsters have grown up with their lives online , using @entity129 and @entity130			2
‘ nowadays everything is quite intrusive , ’ @entity101 points out			2
‘ it does n’t bother me , i ’m a very open person			0
but before you talk on camera , it ’s important to decide what you want to keep personal and what you do n’t mind other people knowing			0
’ in love : @entity140 is studying criminology in @entity102 and is deeply in love with her boyfriend @entity106 struggling with identity : @entity144 is trying to reconcile his religion with his love of pop music such as @entity148 that ’s more difficult for participants such as @entity144 in @entity153 , whose family are observant @entity154			1
there ’s a lot he wants to say , but he does n’t want to offend his loved ones			0
though he ’s still religious , he does n’t want to attend mosque several times a day			0
he prefers to be with his friends , studying law and listening to music – he confesses that he ’s a @entity148 fan , though his mother thinks pop music is a temptation devised by the devil			0
@entity144 is coping bravely as he tries to shed the restrictions of his culture			0
‘ i felt i was a bit like a puppet as a kid , ’ he says frankly			0
@entity172 is dealing with a different kind of culture shock			0
at 14 she lived in a @entity177 village and had visited a city just once – ‘ i did n’t like @entity179 , it was too big ! ’ but now she ’s on the other side of the world , teaching @entity182 to @entity184 teens in @entity186 province , and when she walks down the street people stop and stare – many have never seen a @entity190 woman before			1
for @entity172 , one catalyst of this massive change was the break - up of her parents ’ marriage			1
she has n’t heard from her father for two years			0
‘ i do n’t think he cares , ’ she says sadly			0
tribulations : @entity199 has had to deal with her parents ' divorce and has n't heard from her dad in years footballer : @entity204 had signed for @entity205 but left after injuries			0
he is now looking for a new club professional footballer @entity204 is very close to his parents , and relies on them for support and encouragement in his career			0
as a teenager he was a promising talent at @entity205 , but he ’s suffered injury setbacks and is currently on the hunt for a new club			0
@entity204 has an unusual perspective on the tv series – he ’s looking forward to the @entity220 edition , when he hopes to be able to sit down with his children and grandchildren so they can see what his life has been like			1
‘ it ’s a massive project and i ’m delighted to be a part of it – it ’s priceless , ’ he told me this week			0
he too shares the sense that they ’re part of an extended family – though it came as a shock to @entity14 when he introduced her to a friend as ‘ my second mum ’			0
‘ i ’d never thought of it in those terms , ’ she says , ‘ although i am the same age as his dad			0
’ social media means that , although the 14 participants are now living as far apart as @entity244 and @entity184 , they ’re all able to maintain contact			1
they met in @entity95 earlier this month for a premiere screening of the programme			0
‘ @entity28 ’s mum and mine hit it off , and now they ’re going to do a charity run together , ’ @entity204 says			0
‘ one of the other guys is into the same music as me , so we ’re going to meet up			0
this show is a real blessing in my life			0
’ ‘ it ’s weird to see how much we ’ve grown up and changed , ’ laughs @entity101			0
‘ but it ’s really nice to share this thing together , and to have our lives documented			0
i ’ll definitely want to continue with it in the future			0
’ 21 @entity267 is on @entity22 at 10.35pm on september 1 and 2			1
