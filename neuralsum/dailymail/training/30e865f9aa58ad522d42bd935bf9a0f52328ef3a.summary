it opened to great fanfare promising spectacular views across @entity3 , but the first guests of the @entity5 in @entity6 got rather more than they bargained for			1
a design fault appeared to give the ultimate ' peeping tom ' view into other rooms , with guests complaining about unwanted sights and the @entity5 hastily erecting some modesty blinds			1
so perhaps it is unsurprising that the luxury hotel on @entity6 's 34th to 52nd floors has been voted the worst hotel opening of 2014 by expert reviewers at @entity19			1
the global members organisation put together its ultimate list of the best and worst hotel openings of 2014 , with @entity3 accommodation taking the top spot in both lists			1
while the @entity5 at @entity6 was voted worst , with the capital 's boutique hotel @entity29 taking third place , the independent @entity27 hotel in @entity3 's @entity28 was praised for its @entity34 - inspired rooms and perfect service and took first place for the best hotel opening of the year			1
@entity39 's @entity38 was also praised by the organisation , taking 10th place in the best hotel openings list and praised for creating ' a stand out country house hotel experience , enhanced by warm and caring staff , who are mostly locals			1
' so , who else got it right this year and who got it wrong ? here we give you the best and worst new luxury hotels of 2014 ...			1
. the worst of the lot : a design fault at @entity5 means guests can look into neighbouring rooms @entity58 : the @entity27 in @entity3 opened in september and was deemed ' perfect ' by @entity19 's experts the best 1			1
@entity27 , @entity3 opened by @entity61 and @entity62 , famed for their dining empire including @entity3 's @entity65 , the @entity27 was their long - awaited foray into the hotel world			1
@entity19 said it was no surprise that the hotel opening was pushed back several times , so that everything would be perfect			1
and experts concluded that ' perfect it is '			1
they said : ' in fact it feels like it has been there forever , and the @entity34 inspired rooms and suites are warm and welcoming			2
@entity80 is outstanding and deservedly one of the hottest reservations in town			2
the hotel came first in the list of best new luxury hotel openings of 2014 @entity88 , @entity89 : hotel 's opening was pushed back to ensure everything was perfect 2			1
portrait , @entity94 this luxury boutique hotel has unbeatable views of the @entity97			1
and @entity19 loved the huge rooms and suites			2
couture shoemakers @entity101 own it – and the family have poured heart , soul and money into what is a wonderful property			2
portrait in @entity94 : this luxury boutique hotel has unbeatable views of the @entity112 @entity39 's @entity38 hotel was praised for its country atmosphere and charming local staff , putting it in 10th place third place : @entity119 had a lengthy refurbishment but is an iconic property in a superb location 1			1

@entity141 , @entity125 ok , so this is not really a new hotel as such – but the lengthy and well - executed refurbishment has revealed a property that is new in many regards			1
this iconic property still offers a superb location and some of the largest rooms and suites in the city			1
the experts love the lighter , cleaner lines of the décor			2
@entity126 , @entity127 as @entity126 continue their prolific global expansion , it would be easy for the brand ( and @entity19 ) to become a little blasé			0
but they rarely put a foot wrong			0
here , they have created a wonderful , warm and luxurious hotel in a stunning location			2
it ’s a shame that they could n’t get the spa ( set to be one of the best in @entity127 ) ready in time for the opening – an oversight , which marks them down in our books			0
@entity172 , @entity129 a little isolated , compared to most of the top resorts , and on a tiny piece of atoll real estate , just 800 metres by 200 metres , thereby delivering a real @entity129 experience			0
wonderful island chic accommodations , a great spa and plentiful in / on water activities make this our new favourite @entity129 destination			0
fourth : four seasons in @entity127 ' rarely put a foot a wrong ' and have created a ' warm and luxurious hotel ' fifth : @entity128 in @entity129 has ' chic accommodations ' and a ' great spa ' as well as water activities 1			2

@entity5 , @entity3 what views ! we 're not talking about the amazing @entity3 skyline stretched out below you from your room – but , rather , those direct views into neighbouring rooms			1
and when you can see them , you know they can see you too ... this disastrous design fault has already been well documented by the global media , but we have witnessed it first hand on two occasions and it is very disconcerting			0
the hotel ’s solution has been to fit blinds , but then you are in just another hotel room , which completely erodes the whole purpose of staying here , in one the tallest building in @entity227 , as room décor and size is only on par with the average @entity3 star hotel			1
@entity232 , @entity190 @entity189 @entity233 failed to impress us , but after three days at @entity235 we would have returned to the @entity233 location in a heartbeat			1
there is so much wrong here – including poor location , poor management and many of the hotel ’s dining and entertainment options failing to draw the crowds , meaning shutdowns ( or limited opening hours )			2
second worst : @entity189 was deemed to have a ' poor location , poor management ' and fails to ' draw the crowds ' many of @entity189 's dining and entertainment options failed to ' draw the crowds ' meaning limited opening hours 3			1
@entity191 , @entity3 we are long - standing fans of the wonderful hotels created by @entity259			1
but this one sadly falls well short of their usual high standards			0
it has a feel of a pop up and appears unfinished and lacking in warmth and character			0
the overall exterior look is very corporate and jars with the unique character of @entity269			0
in time it could blossom – and if anyone can achieve this it is the @entity273 duo			0
they have their work cut out on this occasion			0
@entity192 , @entity125 there is much to like about this property , but after three visits we have one important issue , which seems to have gone unaddressed ( so far ) – and that is noise levels			2
traffic and construction noise , from insufficient glazing , is a major design flaw at this 24 - hour location – with huge implications			0
fourth worst : despite having much to like , experts thought @entity192 was noisy from ' insufficient glazing ' 5			1
@entity291 , @entity194 the me brand disappoints yet again			0
we have real issues here with poor management , service and food			0
and we are also surprised at how such a major financial investment could be followed by such low standards .			0
