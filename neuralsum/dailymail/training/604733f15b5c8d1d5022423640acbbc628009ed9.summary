by @entity0 published : 08:39 est , 19 january 2014 updated : 12:06 est , 19 january 2014 the children of families involved with @entity6 's controversial @entity5 documentary are being bullied at school for featuring on the show			1
boys and girls from families who live on @entity5 , @entity11 , have now been victimised at school , as well as being exposed to national scrutiny , according to a community activist			1
@entity15 , part of the @entity17 , said that even adults have been pulling up outside the playground to shout abuse at children as they play outside			1
viewers were shocked at scenes in which residents confessed to fiddling their benefits , a serial theif was followed around on a shoplifting spree and an alcoholic tried to make some easy cash by gathering up free magazines and trying to sell them as copies of the @entity48			2
mr @entity15 said that the problem was worst at the @entity50 , which is on @entity5 , but that it applied to schools around the area			1
he told @entity53 : ' people are driving down the street hurling abuse			2
' there is stigmatisation of the children at the local school			1
and indeed other children at other schools have been bullied - at secondary schools too			2
' no matter how sympathetic teaching staff will be , children are now going to school with that stigma attached to him			1
they will be the true victims of all of this			0
ignored : at a youth group meeting children said @entity5 taught them to shun people from @entity5 challenge : residents of @entity5 had a challenge ahead of them to compete in the @entity76 in @entity78 competition ' we host a youth forum and discussed it yesterday			1
some children , as young as 12 , were saying the impression they got from the programme was not to talk to people from that street			2
' ' a team of us has been on the ground assisting the families - we seem to be the only ones that give a damn about them			0
we can clearly see they are people that have been taken advantage of			0
the whole area has been stigmatised - as if to say if you live on that street you 're a drunk that likes to use drugs and scrounge - which is totally wrong			0
' the people i have met are very decent people , who with a little bit of help could improve their lives quite significantly			0
but the people of @entity5 have hit back at the show , saying it was billed to them as a celebration of the impoverished street 's ' community spirit '			1
troubled : the programme has prompted a storm of complaints they have also alleged that that film crews cherry - picked scenes to get the most shocking footage , and even offered bribes of alcohol , cigarettes and fast food to encourage filming			2
@entity124 , which made the programme for @entity6 , has denied that residents were misled or bribed			0
critics of the programme have also complained that it misrepresents the realities of living on benefits			0
in response to the record number of complaints made to @entity6 and broadcasting watchdog @entity136 , the channel has organised a live tv debate in which residents can participate			0
but mr @entity15 said that the stigma , including playground bullying , of appearing on @entity5 has scared them off			1
he told the @entity142 ' not many of them are keen to take part in the live debate			0
' ' the ten residents i am in contact with have said they wo n't take part			0
