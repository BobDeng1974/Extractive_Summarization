by @entity0 , former @entity1 chief superintendent published : 20:17 est , 24 march 2014 updated : 02:40 est , 25 march 2014 public trust in the police is one of the essential ingredients of a well - ordered society			1
as a former senior officer myself , i can only regret how badly the police 's reputation for integrity has been tarnished in recent years			1
now another shattering blow has come with the revelations by this paper about an undercover three - year investigation into serious criminal behaviour and corruption by a group of trusted detectives in the @entity1			1
it appears that much of the evidence of this behaviour — such as files , videos and photographs — may have been deliberately shredded by @entity27 in 2003 in an attempt to thwart the anti-corruption investigation			1
the refusal to risk tarnishing the reputation of the @entity1 has led to a deeply troubling culture of cover - ups			1
@entity40 was killed with an axe in the car park of a @entity44 pub in 1987			2
no - one has been brought to justice for his murder what makes these findings all the more shocking is the possibility that this web of dishonesty could have undermined @entity27 's inquiries into two high - profile murder cases : that of the black teenager @entity38 and of the private eye @entity40 , who was killed with an axe in the car park of a @entity44 pub in 1987			1
at the time of his murder , which still remains unsolved 27 years later , @entity40 was carrying out his own investigation into alleged corruption within @entity44 detective squads			1
previous official inquiries into the disastrously botched handling of the @entity38 murder case have already exposed an insidious police culture of deceit , malpractice , racial prejudice and incompetence			2
now the home secretary has ordered another inquiry , this one into serious allegations that the @entity1 sent in undercover officers to spy secretly on the @entity38 family in the aftermath of @entity38 's death in 1993			1
this new outrage follows other major recent scandals which have shown the police at their worst			1
abuses one was the notorious @entity83 incident in which officers on duty in @entity86 allegedly conspired to destroy the career of cabinet minister @entity88 by making false accusations against him			2
apart from the corruption itself , one of the features common to all these appalling incidents is the apparent impulse to cover up the wrong - doing , to close ranks , to frustrate and mislead investigators			2
metropolitan police commissioner @entity99 will be quizzed by the @entity100 time after time , the instinct of the police is not to face up to the challenge of abuses in their midst , but to pretend that they do not exist			1
log books are distorted ; statements manufactured			2
in many of these cases — @entity83 is just one example — the cover - up and all that goes with it turn out to be worse than the original crime			0
one of the more depressing aspects of these recent scandals is that they are so reminiscent of the dark days of the @entity118 , when many police forces were riddled with abuses			1
we had been promised that such misconduct had been consigned to the dustbin of history , that a new era of scrupulously honest policing had arrived			0
but the @entity128 's stories about the shredding of ' lorry loads ' of documents and the taking of bribes could have come straight from the police force of 40 years ago , when i was a young officer			1
then , just as today , the vast majority of my colleagues were honourable , decent people who had joined the force to fight crime and protect the public			0
corruption , though undoubtedly practised by a few bad apples , was not endemic			0
nevertheless , there was a powerful ' canteen culture ' which meant that wrong - doers were often protected , particularly within certain elements of the @entity147 ( @entity147 ) and some specialist regional squads			0
they looked after their own , hostile to any outsiders or to scrutiny of their methods			0
detective inspectors were treated like gods by their men , which fed their sense of invincibility and their belief that they were a law unto themselves			0
in this climate , a small but significant minority were willing to bend the law , sometimes to get results , sometimes for their own selfish ends			0
a few even became allies of criminals			0
they ' fitted up ' innocent men so that the guilty would go free or ensured that charges were dropped			0
in return for cash , they gave criminal gangs warnings of imminent raids or arrests			0
they were willing to lie on oath , siphon off their share of money for informants and even share in the proceeds of drug deals and robberies			0
heroic it was this culture that sir @entity189 was determined to smash when he took over as @entity190 in 1972 , having already won a reputation as a radical reformer when serving as chief constable of @entity194			1
sir @entity189 was a man i admired tremendously because of his natural authority , his straight talking and his determination			2
when he said he was going to root out corruption , he meant it			0
one of his most acerbic pronouncements , which reflected the prevalence of dishonesty in the early @entity118 , was : ' a good police force is one which catches more crooks than it employs			2
' sir @entity189 was determined to smash when he took over as @entity190 in 1972 as a result of his heroic efforts to reform the @entity1 , more than 500 officers were dismissed or forced to resign			1
jail sentences were given to two chiefs : commander @entity214 of the @entity215 and detective chief superintendent @entity216 , head of the @entity217			0
sir @entity189 's actions may have caused dismay to the corrupt cliques , but his resolute campaign was welcomed by officers like me who were fed up with the way the abusers were destroying the @entity1 's image			1
sadly , sir @entity189 resigned in 1977 following a row with the @entity229 , his work still unfinished			2
none of his successors have matched him for resolution and guts			0
that was all too graphically demonstrated when another investigation into @entity1 corruption was held between 1978 and 1982 in the wake of sir @entity189 's reforms			1
called @entity240 , it was conducted by detectives from @entity242 and @entity243			0
these men complained bitterly that their investigation had been wilfully obstructed by both the metropolitan commissioner sir @entity246 and by the @entity247 sir @entity248			2
it was the same story in the mid-nineties , when i was a chief superintendent			0
throughout this period , the commissioner sir @entity252 trumpeted his commitment to another anti-corruption drive within his force , but i sensed it was all just empty words			1
so i decided to challenge him			0
' how many senior officers have actually been dismissed for corruption ? ' i asked			0
since sir @entity189 's courageous fight , real leadership has been sorely lacking at the top of the @entity1			1
that is why corrupt coppers have been able to get away with it for far too long			0
since my retirement from the force , i have experienced the police 's behaviour from the other side			1
acting as a security consultant and adviser , i was involved in a case where the police wanted a central @entity44 nightclub to lose its licence because of allegations of disorderly behaviour			2
attack in court , i was one of the witnesses for the nightclub			0
i made a list of recommendations on how the club could be better run			0
what amazed me was how the police , opposing my stance , were willing to undermine my record , attack my credibility as an expert , and even wrongly question my former rank to ensure that they won their argument			2
if the police were willing to do this to me , who had once been in charge of protecting the @entity302 and the @entity303 , what might they be willing to do to an ordinary member of the public ? sir @entity189 almost succeeded in cleaning up the @entity309 stables of the force 40 years ago			1
will the present - day commissioner sir @entity99 be up to the job ? if the news reports of recent days are anything to go by , the task remains herculean .			1

police 's reputation for integrity has been tarnished in recent years
successive @entity1 commissioners have *launched* anti-corruption drives
but refusal to risk tarnishing its reputation has been deeply troubling
will sir @entity99 be up to the job ?
