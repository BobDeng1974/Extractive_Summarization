astronomers have discovered a black hole that is consuming gas from a nearby star 10 times faster than previously thought possible			1
the black hole , known as @entity5 , lies on the outskirts of the galaxy @entity7 about 12 million light years from @entity8			1
researchers say it is ingesting a weight equivalent to 100 billion billion hot dogs every minute			1

the discovery was published today in the journal @entity35			0
@entity36 for @entity38 astronomer dr @entity22 , who is based at @entity41 's @entity40 node , said that as gas falls towards a black hole it gets very hot and bright			2
he said scientists first noticed @entity19 because it was a lot more luminous than other black holes , but it was initially assumed that it was simply bigger			0
' it was generally believed the maximum speed at which a black hole could swallow gas and produce light was tightly determined by its size , ' dr @entity22 said			2
' so it made sense to assume that @entity5 was bigger than the ordinary , less bright black holes we see in our own galaxy , the @entity57			0

' there 's not really a strict limit like we thought , black holes can actually consume more gas and produce more light , ' dr @entity22 said			0

dr @entity22 said @entity5 rotates around a supergiant ' donor ' star 20 times heavier than our own @entity28 he said the scientists saw that one side of the donor star was always brighter than the other because it was illuminated by x-rays coming from near the black hole , so the star appeared brighter or fainter as it went around @entity88			1
' this allowed us to measure the time it takes for the black hole and the donor star to rotate around each other , which is 64 days , and to model the velocity of the two objects and the shape of the orbit , ' dr @entity22 said			0
' from this , we worked out that the black hole must be less than 15 times the mass of our @entity28 ' dr @entity22 compared @entity19 to small @entity105 eating champion @entity103			1
' as hotdog - eating legend @entity103 famously showed us , size does not always matter in the world of competitive eating and even small black holes can sometimes eat gas at an exceptional rate , ' he said			2
dr @entity22 said @entity19 is a member of a select group of black holes known as ultraluminous x-ray sources			0
' these are the champions of competitive gas eating in the @entity118 , capable of swallowing their donor star in less than a million years , which is a very short time on cosmic scales , ' he said .			0

black hole known as @entity5 lies 12 million light years from @entity8
consuming gas from a nearby star 10 times faster than previously thought possible
researchers liken galaxy to competitive eater @entity103 - and say it is ingesting a weight equivalent to 100 billion billion hot dogs every minute
