the mother of a teenager with type 1 diabetes has revealed how she ’s sometimes too scared to go to sleep in case she misses checking her daughter ’s blood sugar levels in the night – something that could be fatal			1
@entity7 , 15 , from @entity8 in @entity9 , was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in 2006			1
the disease caused her immune system to eat her own pancreas , which left her body unable to produce insulin , a hormone that helps the body use food for energy			1
there is no cure for the disease and @entity7 could die in minutes if she ’s not given the right quantity of insulin at the right time			1
the disease caused her immune system to eat her own pancreas her mother , @entity27 , and father rotate getting up and midnight , 3am and 6am to check @entity7 ’s blood sugar levels and their daily struggle to keep her alive has been turned into a film – called @entity41			1
on the film , first shown by @entity43 , @entity27 says : ‘ do i fear sleep ? yeah , if i ’m on duty i do			0
’ @entity7 is also helped by a diabetic alert dog , @entity47 , who can sense when her glucose levels are too low and give her a nudge to get them checked			2
since being diagnosed with @entity52 , @entity7 has endured 34,000 blood tests			1
5,552 shots and 1,660 medical tubing injections , according to her fundraising page			1
it ’s been set up to fund artificial pancreases for @entity7 and other @entity52 sufferers			2
the page emphasizes how the disease can affect anyone , regardless of health and lifestyle			0
@entity7 is helped by a diabetic alert dog , @entity47 , who can sense when her glucose levels are too low it says : ‘ this disease strikes without warning regardless of diet or lifestyle , and can occur in anyone			1
there is nothing in the market to prevent @entity52 , and – at present – nothing that can get rid of it			0
‘ too much exercise , wrong measurements of food or insulin can be fatal			0
blood glucose must be monitored on average 8 - 12 times a day by pricking the finger for blood			0
treatment kits are carried around the clock			0
yet even all this can not fully prevent organ failure , or a host of the disease ’s more serious effects , such as blindness , nerve damage , heart attacks , strokes , and pregnancy complications			0
’ despite her condition @entity7 tries to be philosophical and upbeat about life			0
she says : ‘ it ’s just scary			0
one day i could here , and one day i could just not			0
so i guess i kind of appreciate the little things more			0
’ dr @entity101 , from @entity102 in @entity103 , is optimistic that we will one day be able to manage type 1 diabetes far more easily			1
he told @entity106 : ' type 1 diabetes is a terrible disease that seems to strike at random and without warning			1
but for those that suffer it , it means a sudden and complete failure of the pancreas to produce insulin and causes a rise in blood glucose			1
' there is , sadly , nothing that we can do to prevent it from happening			0
once present , insulin injections are the only treatment			2
i 'm sure one day we 'll look back at daily insulin injections and think of them as a throw back to the old days			2
we need to keep searching for a much simpler , safer , less intrusive way of controlling blood levels of glucose and insulin and helping people with @entity52 diabetes live normal , productive lives much more easily			2
