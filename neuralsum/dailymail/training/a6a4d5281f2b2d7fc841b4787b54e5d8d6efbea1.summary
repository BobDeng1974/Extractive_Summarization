a scan is pictured @entity3 is known as an autoimmune condition			0
this is where something goes wrong with the immune system - the body ’s defence against infection - and it mistakenly attacks healthy body tissue – in this case , the myelin covering of nerves			0
this can cause multiple sections of the brain and spinal column to become damaged and hardened , which can disrupt the nerve signals passing through these areas			0
exactly what causes the immune system to act in this way is unclear , but most experts think a combination of genetic and environmental factors are involved			0
this new study finds that epsilon toxin could be one of the triggers			2
source : @entity57 @entity3 is characterised by blood brain permeability and demyelination - a process in which the insulating myelin sheaths of neurons are damaged			2
microbiologist @entity62 of @entity63 , @entity64 , said : ‘ we provide evidence that supports epsilon toxin ’s ability to cause permeability and show that epsilon toxin kills the brain ’s myelin producing cells , oligodendrocytes - the same cells that die in @entity3 lesions			1
’ she presented the new research at the @entity78 and @entity79 in the @entity15 ‘ we also show that epsilon toxin targets other cells types associated with @entity3 inflammation such as the retinal vascular and meningeal cells , ’ ( cells of the membranes that envelop the central nervous system ) , she said			1
‘ epsilon toxin may be responsible for triggering @entity3 ’ epsilon toxin is produced by certain strains of @entity91 , which is a spore - forming bacterium that is one of the most common causes of foodborne illness			1
epsilon toxin is produced by certain strains of @entity91 ( pictured ) which is a spore - forming bacterium that is one of the most common causes of foodborne illness previous studies have suggested that @entity91 , and in particular , epsilon toxin , may play a role in triggering ms. late last year dr @entity102 and her colleagues discovered @entity105 perfringens type b - a strain that is not known to infect humans and produces the epsilon toxin - in a 21 - year - old woman who was experiencing a flare - up of her @entity3 to further test their hypothesis @entity102 and her team studied the behaviour of the toxin in mice focusing on which cells it targeted			1
they discovered that the toxin did target the brain cells associated with @entity3 pathology , but that was not all they found			0
dr @entity102 said : ‘ originally , we only thought that epsilon toxin would target the brain endothelium cells and oligodendrocytes ; we just happened to notice that it also bound to and killed meningeal cells ( of neurons )			2
’ ‘ this was exciting because it provides a possible explanation for meningeal inflammation and subpial cortical lesions exclusively observed in @entity3 patients , but not fully understood			0
’ they also tested samples of local foods for the presence of @entity91 and the toxin gene			0
of the 37 food samples , 13.5 per cent were positive for bacteria and almost three per cent were positive for the epsilon toxin gene			2
dr @entity102 said the findings are important scientists now know that the epsilon toxin is a trigger of ms. development of a neutralising antibody or vaccine directed against the epsilon toxin might stop the progression of the disease or prevent it from even developing , she added .			1
