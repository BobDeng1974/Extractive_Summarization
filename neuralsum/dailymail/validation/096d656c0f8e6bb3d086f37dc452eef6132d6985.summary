a former @entity1 cop who retired after 25 years service to start an ammunition manufacturing and wholesale business has now developed vending machines that dispense ' pretty much everything ' when it comes to bullets			1
but while @entity12 , of @entity13 , says that gun clubs from all over are ' chomping at the bit ' for their pay - as - you - go dispensaries , complaints about the machines and their safety seem just as widespread			1
@entity12 has installed two at his local gun club , the @entity18 and @entity19 , which , like many , refuses to sell ' non-jacketed ' rounds of ammunition , making the machines popular among members			1
controversial : an ammunition salesman and former cop has installed two vending machines that dispense ammunition at his local gun club in @entity13 , @entity1 ' it 's not like someone walking off the street can get in and buy ammunition ' : former cop @entity12 says the machines are perfectly legal and that he created them for the convenience of gun club members only the machines are kept behind locked doors that require a digital key fob - which all members have - to open			1

' it 's not like someone walking off the street can get in and buy ammunition , ' he told @entity61			0

not candy : this vending machine - operated by @entity12 , a candidate for @entity90 - which distributes firearms ammunition is raising some eyebrows a spokesman for the @entity95 - which regulates the sale of ammunition - confirmed to the newspaper the machines could provide bullets to minors			1
' i do n't want to speculate as to what is or is not happening in this particular situation , but a licensee can not sell ammunition to anyone under the age of 18 , and importantly you can not sell handgun ammunition to individuals under the age of 21 , ' @entity102 special agent @entity101 told the paper			1
@entity12 said he had the idea years ago , and spent time modifying the machines so they could accept larger bills and credit cards , with the price of bullets much higher than that of candy			2
