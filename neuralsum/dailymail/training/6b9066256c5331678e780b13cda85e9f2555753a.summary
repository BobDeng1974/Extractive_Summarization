@entity1 business today throws its weight behind an in - out referendum on @entity4 and warns ‘ the status quo is not an option ’			1
a survey of nearly 4,000 company bosses in the @entity1 shows more than three - quarters back giving the public a say on membership of the @entity11			1
it also reveals that @entity1 business is becoming more eurosceptic with growing support for quitting the @entity11 altogether or withdrawing and securing new trade agreements			1
however , the majority - or 61.4 per cent of those asked in the @entity18 poll - wants @entity1 to remain in the @entity11 with powers transferred from @entity20 to @entity21			2
many captains of @entity1 industry want a public vote on whethere the @entity1 should leave @entity4 ‘ the status quo is not an option , ’ says @entity18 director general @entity25 in the report			0
‘ ministers must pursue reform and renegotiation as a priority			0
‘ these results show that @entity1 businesses remain determined to see a recalibrated relationship between the @entity1 and the rest of the @entity11 , with more powers exercised from @entity21 rather than @entity20			2
’ @entity38 has promised to renegotiate the terms of @entity1 ’s membership of the @entity11 and hold an in - out referendum in 2017 if the @entity42 win the 2015 general election			1
it would be the first vote on the @entity1 ’s relationship with @entity4 since 1975 but it is vehemently opposed by @entity47 and the @entity48			0
the @entity18 report shows that 53.6 per cent of firms believe a full withdrawal from the @entity11 would be bad for business			1
the prospect of a referendum has also sparked outrage among @entity56 who claim that @entity1 would be isolated economically and politically if it left the @entity11			1
but 800 business leaders have now signed up to @entity58 , a campaign group in favour of renegotiating the terms of @entity1 membership of the @entity11			1
@entity61 , chief executive of the group , said : ‘ it is fantastic to see further evidence that business people in @entity1 want to have their say on the @entity11			2
‘ it would be wrong of anyone to characterise @entity1 business as being content with the current relationship with @entity20 , which is why it is so important that the process of renegotiating a fundamental change in @entity1 ’s membership begins today			2
’ the @entity18 report shows that 53.6 per cent of firms believe a full withdrawal from the @entity11 would be bad for business			1
but this is down from 60 per cent three months ago while the proportion who believes quitting the @entity11 would be good for business has risen from 18 per cent to 19.5 per cent			2
over one - third of companies , or 35.6 per cent , favour withdrawal followed by new trade agreements to ensure exports are not hit			0
this is up from 33 per cent three months ago while opposition to such a move has fallen from 42 per cent to 36.7 per cent			0
but the majority - or more than six in 10 company bosses - want @entity1 to remain in the @entity11 with powers transferred back from @entity20 to @entity21			0
and although 43 per cent of business back the prime minister ’s plan to hold a referendum in 2017 after negotiations have run their course , 34 per cent want a vote far sooner			0
‘ businesses reject both the @entity100 dream of further integration and the @entity103 dream of a complete exit from the @entity11 provided a satisfactory renegotiation is achieved , ’ says mr @entity25			0
but he warns that the split over when the referendum should take place ‘ shows that there is an impatience amongst a significant number of companies for greater clarity on the @entity1 ’s position ’ .			0

business leaders say they want a referendum on @entity11 membership
but more than half say a full withdrawal would be bad for business
