@entity6 was fit , incidentally			2
she loved to dance , and though she did n't go as far as some of her peers in regards to dieting , she did use diet pills and diuretics			0

' @entity6 's second marriage was to someone she describes as an ' extremely lovely conscious man			1
' their relationship remains strong and @entity6 's career is on the upswing			1
yet still she could n't quieten the constant self - berating inner - dialogue she had regarding her body			2

emotionally loaded : @entity6 describes the dancing she performed as the photographer snapped away as both ' celebratory ' and a course of ' grieving ' @entity6 had a particular breakthrough when @entity27 - who @entity6 said expertly ' midwifed ' the process ' - placed bricks on her back to help her feel the weight of her body image issues pressing down on her			1

' process : when @entity6 reviewed the black - and - white portraits , she says that 80per cent of her embraced what she saw , but the remaining 20per cent of her noticed ' the softness ' of her stomach it 's been more than six months since @entity6 had the photos taken , and she describes the experience as enduringly ' healing			1
' ' i have a much more positive attitude about my body , and have grown more comfortable with the skin i am in , ' she tells us			0
' i find myself feeling grateful for this body that allows me to be in this world , so i may offer my work and talents , experience life and love , savor food that nourishes me , touch and be touched			2
