@entity1 's stars are being worked harder in training than ever before by new manager @entity3 , club insiders have revealed ... and here is the evidence			2
such is @entity8 's ferocious desire to fast track the players he inherited from @entity10 on to the levels he desires that @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 are being driven relentlessly by the @entity17 coach on a daily basis			1
and the @entity1 squad were pictured being put through their paces on thursday , in scenes reminiscent of a pre-season training camp			1
@entity3 keeps a watch on @entity13 and @entity24 as they 're put through their paces @entity13 and his strike partner @entity14 are pictured lifting weights at @entity1 's @entity29 @entity30 leads his team - mate through a set of leg exercises designed to improve their core fitness @entity35 , who arrived from @entity36 on deadline day , lifts weights at @entity1 's training headquarters @entity13 , @entity30 and new signing @entity35 were among those lifting weights and taking part in numerous training drills ahead of their home clash against @entity46 on sunday			1
chief among @entity8 's methods as he tries to bring about fundamental change at @entity50 are incessant passing drills that see the @entity1 players put through endless repetitive routines aimed at honing and developing new instincts			1
@entity8 has spoken of how he wishes his players to think differently and react differently when they are in possession			0
by putting them through these endless drills , he hopes they will use the ball better and will eventually make better decisions without even seeming to think			0
the new @entity1 manager has also shown himself to be a lover of double training sessions			1
@entity8 asked his squad to train twice - a - day regularly on pre-season tour of @entity67 as he sought to change his players ' thoughts and instincts quickly			0
that practice has continued to an extent , though , now that the @entity74 season has started and it 's not unusual for players to train late in the morning , rest in the sleep unit that was installed last year at @entity29 and then train again in the afternoon			2
' it can seem relentless but the players understand why @entity81 is doing it , ' said a club source earlier this week			0
@entity84 and @entity30 appear to show the strain of the new training sessions at @entity29 @entity8 chats with @entity1 vice-captain @entity84 ahead of their weekend clash against @entity46 @entity3 was spotted leaving the @entity89 in @entity90 on tuesday morning @entity8 seemed to be looking for the right space as he prepared to leave the @entity89 @entity1 's players have also been playing full - paced 11 v 11 games in training prior to games @entity30 ( right , with @entity35 ) has praised the methods of @entity8 @entity1 's players have often been sleeping at @entity29 between double training sessions ' the passing drills are incredible			1
it 's just " pass , pass , pass " until the manager and his coaches think the players are beginning to do it almost naturally and instinctively			0
' @entity30 – who played under @entity3 for two years for the @entity17 national team – said on wednesday that some of the @entity1 manager 's sessions are ' incredible ' , with players having to be focused during ' every single minute '			1
it is also understood that another of @entity8 's policies is to play full - sided 11 v 11 games for 45 minutes two days before a game			2
this game is required to be of the intensity of a @entity74 game and is aimed at preparing the players mentally and physically for the competitive game that is due to follow 48 hours later			0
@entity13 ( left , with coach @entity121 ) and his @entity1 team - mates are said to be pleased with training @entity124 ( left ) and @entity35 are two new signings adapting to @entity3 's training methods it is not unusual for managers to play full - sided games in training as it allows the weekend 's anticipated first team the opportunity to get used to each other and grow familiarity			2
however , they are usually played at half or three - quarter pace and full - on contact is minimal as managers are generally paranoid about injuries			0
what has struck the @entity1 players about @entity8 's 45 minute games , though , has been the intensity			2
to play these games at full pace is rare but @entity8 insists on it so that his players are ' match ready ' when the actual competitive fixture comes around two days later			0
during his time in @entity150 – and indeed during the @entity151 – @entity8 has shown himself to be surprisingly open about injuries and fitness issues			0
most managers like to hide problems from the public so as to keep the opposition guessing and will sometimes exaggerate minor knocks to fool rivals in to thinking star players are n't available			0
@entity8 does n't do this but the former @entity163 and @entity164 coach is obsessively secretive about his team shapes and training drills to the extent that he will only allow players and staff absolutely vital to the session anywhere near the @entity29 pitches when the first team are working			1
other @entity173 staff are asked to stay away so that @entity8 can go about his business in private before players are handed individual dvds and dossiers of their training performances to watch later with @entity1 's performance staff and even at home in their spare time			1
@entity13 drives into training despite the fact he is suspended for the clash with old club @entity46 @entity14 looks focused as he prepares to continue his goalscoring run @entity1 's £ 60m signing @entity186 shows off his shiny studs as he motors in @entity188 ( left ) is another who will be playing against his old club and he drives in with his brother @entity192 made his debut for @entity1 against @entity194 last saturday @entity192 ( left ) is one of several young players @entity3 has promoted to @entity1 's first team like our @entity1 facebook page .			1

new @entity1 boss has *implemented* a strict new training regime
only players and essential staff allowed on @entity173 pitches when the first team are training due to @entity8 's desire for complete secrecy
@entity13 , @entity30 and the rest of the @entity1 squad were pictured lifting weights on thursday ahead of their @entity50 meeting with @entity46
@entity8 's hopes repetitive drills will improve players when on the ball
players sometimes sleep at @entity29 between double training sessions
sources say players have responded well to @entity8 's methods
@entity17 also *pledges* to continue *fielding* young players in first team
