@entity0 today moved to reject claims his government was complicit in the torture of terrorist suspects by @entity6 agents			1
the former prime minister , facing growing calls to appear before mps over what he knew about @entity12 ' enhanced interrogation techniques when he was in @entity13 , said he had ' always been opposed to the use of torture '			1
it came as the clamour for a judge - led inquiry into @entity22 's role in torture grew - with former home secretary @entity24 and shadow minister @entity25 joining calls for the former prime minister to be quizzed on @entity22 's role in the barbaric treatment of prisoners by the @entity12			1
her intervention means the @entity43 front bench is on the verge of supporting an inquiry that could be hugely embarrassing for both mr @entity0 and @entity46 – the brother of the party 's current leader			2
but a spokesman for mr @entity0 's office said : ' for the avoidance of doubt , @entity0 has always been opposed to the use of torture , has always said so publicly and privately , has never condoned its use and - as is shown by internal government documentation already made public - thinks it is totally unacceptable			1
' he believes the fight against radical @entity60 is a fight about values , and acting contrary to those values - as in the use of torture - is therefore not just wrong but counter-productive			0
' it came after mps said former foreign secretary @entity31 – who has been interviewed as a ' witness ' by detectives investigating the rendition of two @entity70 dissidents – must also be held to account			1
last night , former @entity72 attorney general @entity71 backed the calls for a judge - led inquiry once the police investigations are over , saying it was needed to provide ' finality '			2
and former shadow home secretary @entity79 told @entity80 a judge must take charge			0
he said : ' one must understand the sheer weight of pressure that comes from the @entity85 to try and stop this sort of stuff coming out , so i think this needs to be a judicial inquiry			1
' at @entity91 , the weekend was dominated by the continued fallout from last week 's @entity94 report , which detailed how detainees had been subjected to torture such as waterboarding			0
mr @entity97 continues to cling to the position that an inquiry by @entity101 's @entity100 is the best way of finding out the level of @entity22 's involvement			2
in a publicity blitz , @entity100 chairman sir @entity105 yesterday said he had asked the @entity94 committee to reveal the redactions , requested by @entity22 security officials , which led to all mention of @entity111 and @entity112 being removed from the 499 - page report			1
sir @entity105 told the @entity115 's @entity114 this morning that he would seek to question former ministers over @entity22 's role or complicity in torture shadow home secretary @entity25 said her ' instinct ' was to call for a full judicial inquiry into @entity22 torture home secretary @entity124 has insisted she did not request any redactions to an @entity12 report that exposed brutal @entity6 interrogation methods in a bid to cover up any @entity22 involvement			1
mrs may did concede that officials had requested that no evidence was included in the @entity94 's report that would damage national security			0
but she told the @entity135 she could not speak for previous governments			0
her appearance before the @entity100 comes as the government faces mounting cross-party calls for a new judicial inquiry into @entity22 's possible role in the shocking treatment of detainees in the years after the september 11 attacks			1
committee chair @entity145 said he would be asking @entity12 senator @entity146 , who chairs the @entity12 committee that published the @entity6 torture report , and a @entity149 , to give evidence next year			1
the home secretary said she had not read the full 6,000 - page report and had only seen the 500 - page summary made publicly available ' i have certainly not asked for any redactions to take place in the report , ' she said			2
' the only time i met senator @entity146 was in september of this year and i 've not seen the draft report , i 've not asked for any redactions in that report			0
' he also said his committee would ask any former or serving minister with a contribution to make to give evidence – putting the spotlight firmly on mr @entity0 , mr @entity31 and mr @entity46			1
sir @entity105 added : ' if they refuse to do so , that in itself would imply they have something to hide			1
if there is evidence they knew or were involved then of course they would be priority figures for our investigation			0
' if people deserve to be embarrassed it 's our job to embarrass them			0
we have a statutory obligation to carry out this task without fear or favour			0
' however , he admitted that he had no way of compelling the @entity12 to hand over an uncensored copy of the report			2
he also conceded he could not say he was ' confident ' of success			0
home secretary @entity124 will be grilled today by the @entity135 on the extent of her contact with the @entity94 committee and whether she personally lobbied for any redactions			2
@entity100 member @entity200 said it was right to seek details of redacted material but questioned why it should come from the @entity12			2
he said the priority should be to seek answers directly from the government and intelligence agencies			0
the @entity43 mp added : ' it could take months and what we are asking for already exists in @entity213			0
' miss @entity25 said she doubted the @entity100 ' have the capacity and the scope ' to carry out an inquiry , adding that her ' instinct ' was that a judge - led process would still be required to ensure confidence			0
she told the @entity115 that mr @entity0 and other former ministers had ' always said that they would co-operate with all investigations and have said that they would be very keen to do so '			2
miss @entity25 added that it was important to get to the truth to make sure there was no ' shadow of innuendo or allegations cast over the vital work that the [ security ] agencies rightly do to keep us all safe every day of the week '			0
former home secretary mr @entity24 said mr @entity31 and mr @entity0 should go before the committee			1
asked on the @entity114 show if they should give evidence , he said : ' yes , absolutely , yes			0
' former deputy prime minister @entity237 also called for a judicial inquiry			1
he wrote in his @entity240 column : ' we must have a transparent system that reflects our values of fair play and justice , not one that turns a blind eye and deaf ear to claims of the abduction and torture of innocent people			0
' former prime minister @entity0 met the former @entity70 leader @entity252 at his desert base outside @entity254 south of @entity255 in 2007 a parliamentary committee has called on the @entity12 government to hand over any evidence of @entity22 complicity in torture			1
last week a @entity12 @entity94 report exposed the ' brutal ' treatment of @entity264 terror suspects in the wake of 9/11			2
@entity13 has admitted that some material was removed from the report at the @entity22 's request , for national security reasons			2
but it said no redactions related to @entity22 involvement in the mistreatment of prisoners			0
the @entity275 is conducting an inquiry into the treatment of detainees by @entity22 intelligence agencies in the decade following 9/11			2
sir @entity105 , who heads the intelligence committee , told the @entity115 's @entity114 it would request to see redacted material in the @entity94 's public report if it referenced the @entity22			1
he said that if @entity22 intelligence officials were present when people were being tortured then they were complicit in that torture			0
' that would be quite against all the standards of this country , it would be something that ought to be brought into the public domain , ' sir @entity105 added			1
@entity72 defence secretary @entity294 called for mr @entity31 and mr @entity0 to reveal what they knew about the @entity6 's torture and rendition programme when they were in office			1
he said : ' obviously it 's for them , it 's for former ministers to account for the relationship then			0
i hope they will co-operate with any parliamentary inquiry			0
' civil liberties groups and campaigning mps accuse @entity22 of repeatedly turning a blind eye to torture during mr @entity0 's ' war on terror ' – when he worked hand in glove with the @entity316 administration			1
there are allegations that @entity22 agents were present when torture took place and that the @entity22 helped with rendition flights			0
yesterday , one of the two psychologists who were paid to run the interrogation programme by the @entity6 insisted @entity22 agents were at torture sites			1
dr @entity328 , who devised the brutal ' enhanced interrogation ' programmes , said : ' i 'd see their special operations people at the sites i would visit			1
' @entity334 dem business secretary @entity333 said the @entity100 and police investigations into the @entity70 renditions should be allowed to ' run their course '			0
he added : ' if at the end of it , it does n't appear that the truth is emerging , that people imagine there is some kind of cover - up , then of course a judge - led inquiry is the right way to proceed			0
' @entity352 of human rights group @entity351 said : ' until our government sets up a transparent , judicial inquiry , cover - up and official impunity will persist			1

former @entity359 and foreign secretary face @entity362 grilling over torture
@entity0 today claimed he had ' always been opposed to the use of torture '
comes after @entity12 report revealed scale of ' enhanced interrogation ' by @entity6
but the report redacted all evidence of @entity22 complicity with the @entity6
it has led to calls for a full judicial inquiry into what the government knew
a parliamentary committee has *launched* a probe of @entity22 complicity
its chairman sir @entity105 said he would call former ministers
