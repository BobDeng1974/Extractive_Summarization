a crisis - hit hospital flew a doctor in from @entity2 at the cost of £ 5,000 for a single weekend because its @entity5 department was left without cover			1
the consultant made a round trip of more than 8,000 miles to step in after the trust failed to find a local doctor			2
for 48 hours , the jet - lagged doctor covered two consultants ’ jobs at @entity15			1
he worked a 12 - hour shift before being on call for a further 12 hours of saturday , sleeping for just six hours while another consultant from intensive care was on hand to help			1
he repeated the same shift pattern the next day			1
@entity22 , which runs @entity15 , paid £ 5,000 to fly in a doctor from @entity2 to cover a shift it will add to fears that emergency departments are reaching breaking point , due to population pressures , the collapse of @entity26 out - of - hours care and the ageing population			1
conservative health spokesman @entity33 said : ‘ this shows just how chaotic the @entity37 government ’s long - term planning has been for @entity39 staffing			2
‘ they ’ve been warned for years about shortages across all areas , and these warnings have been ignored			0
‘ now health boards have been left in this preposterous situation where they have to hire short - term solutions from the other side of the globe			0
’ across the @entity51 there are thousands of unfilled nursing posts , but @entity15 faces particular trouble recruiting due to the high cost of living , with house prices approaching @entity57 heights due to the oil industry			0
@entity22 has refused to name the consultant who has been commuting from @entity2 to work in @entity15 since the start of august			1
he normally works on a fortnight - on , fortnight - off basis , but a consultant fell ill last weekend , resulting in bosses paying to fly him in			0

but @entity22 pays locums more than that			0
the doctor , whose identity has not been revealed , has been commuting from @entity2 since august , working on a fortnight - on , fortnight - off basis dr @entity74 , of @entity75 , said : ‘ this just seems ridiculous			1
‘ @entity15 should be a great place to stay and work and it is difficult to understand why we do not have the staff to cover for holidays , study leave , retirement and sickness			2
‘ if there is a need for a locum , it is strange that @entity2 is the nearest place to provide one to keep the @entity39 service going			1
‘ no matter how well qualified and experienced a locum is , working in a strange place will always have challenges for them compared to working as a permanent member of staff			0
’ an @entity39 spokesman said : ‘ on this particular occasion , to cover short notice sick leave , we asked this doctor to provide cover over the weekend			2
the doctor is one of our long - term locums and works regularly in the department in @entity15			2
