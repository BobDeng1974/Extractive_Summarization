never mind the @entity1 connotations			1
for now , the bigger picture can remain out of focus , in the background			2
friday night it is all about @entity6 versus @entity7 ; an annual tribal confrontation that needs no wider significance			1
the 2015 edition of the @entity11 explodes into life under lights and the night sky in @entity15 , with a cross-border grudge match that deserves to be viewed as the be-all and end - all for both competing nations			1
when the arch rivals collide at the @entity21 , there will be no thought of tomorrow or the championship title , let alone events to follow later this year			0
@entity25 and @entity26 pose next to the @entity11 trophy ahead of the opening game wales are the favourites for the clash against @entity7 on friday night at the @entity21 the players will forget about the @entity1 , and even the rest of the tournament , in the historic fixture how the @entity6 and @entity7 packs compare few fixtures stir the blood as much as this one , which is why the result ’s ramifications for pool a of the @entity1 — where the next encounter will take place in september — is a topic now on hold until the post-match dust has settled			1
all that will count amid the maelstrom of a typically fervent atmosphere in the @entity51 capital is the here - and - now business of supremacy on the scoreboard			2
any other considerations amount to so much hot air			0
both teams have been determined to address this game in isolation and they are absolutely right to do so , knowing that success here will play a part in addressing the bigger picture anyway			2
there is vast respect for the traditions of this historic sporting duel within both camps			0
‘ it does n’t get any better as a set - up to the championship , ’ said @entity7 head coach @entity69 , as his men prepared to engage in what they hope will become a ghost - busting exercise			1
‘ it ’s an iconic rugby stadium , it ’s an iconic fixture , the history behind the two countries in rugby is huge			0
’ on behalf of @entity6 , an @entity81 voice struck a similar note , with @entity83 adding : ‘ we have always said we are judged on the @entity11			1
the big competitions are the @entity11 and the @entity1			1
the @entity11 is very special and the oldest competition in the world			1
’ this is a fitting place and contest to launch the latest instalment of @entity92 rugby ’s blue - riband event			2
in time , both @entity6 and @entity7 are hell - bent on usurping @entity93 as champions , but they will be painfully aware that this fixture has a make - or - break feel to it			1
for @entity69 ’s regime and for many of the players in white on friday night , there is a subplot of far more immediate significance than the @entity1			1
this match represents a shot at redemption in the arena where captain @entity109 were subjected to a record 30 - 3 defeat in 2013			1
all involved in that debacle — which saw @entity113 hopes blasted to oblivion — are desperate to make amends and that is a powerful motivating force in the visitors ’ favour			0
@entity122 captain @entity121 is one of those who was on duty two years ago and , recalling the bleak episode , the flanker said : ‘ i was very frustrated that we did n’t win and get the @entity113			1
the nature of the way we were beaten was disappointing as well			0
‘ i call it getting caught in the tumble - dryer where you just keep going round and round and there ’s no sign of getting out of there			2
there ’s no purple patch — everything is a mistake compounded by a mistake			0
that ’s a sign of a good team inflicting that on another one			0
‘ we ’re in a completely different place this time			0
we ’re a lot more experienced			0
a couple of years on , the guys have played at that level a lot more			2
they ’ve gone behind to some big southern - hemisphere teams and clawed it back , and other scenarios which can only help keep your head calm			1
’ @entity69 insists @entity7 are in a ' completely different place ' from where they were two years ago the roof will be open at the @entity21 when @entity6 host @entity7 in the @entity11 ominously for @entity7 , defence coach @entity83 believes @entity6 are far better equipped for the battle however , the ominous news for @entity7 is that @entity83 believes @entity6 are far better equipped for the battle than they were a year ago , when they were well beaten at @entity160			1
‘ we are in a better place than we were this time last year when there was a lot going on , ’ he said			0
‘ i just feel we are more focused this year			0
we are also healthy , which is a massive factor			0
’ certainly , a glance through the line - ups explains just why @entity6 are considered clear favourites			1
they are more or less at full strength , many of their leading players are fresh and they will have a roll - call of predatory @entity174 roaming the relaid turf			2
two years ago , @entity177 ’s men dashed @entity81 dreams with an onslaught founded in part on their superiority at the breakdown , based on the back - row alliance of two specialist opensides , captain @entity25 and @entity185			1
this time , the latter is in reserve , with @entity188 back at blindside , but @entity121 knows that he , @entity26 and their @entity7 team - mates again face an arduous task in that pivotal area of combat			1
‘ as a team we have to be spot on at the breakdown , ’ he said			0
‘ we ’re all aware of the threat posed by @entity188 ’s ability to tackle low and @entity25 coming over the ball			0
that ’s going to be a very hot area for us			0
the team that gets the upper hand there will go well			0
’ dejected @entity7 players look on following their 30 - 3 defeat to @entity6 in 2013 @entity6 claimed the title after thrashing @entity7 at the @entity21 @entity208 is surrounded and then tackled by @entity209 during the match @entity7 are weakened by injuries , but remain strong , especially up front			1
@entity83 was right to note : ‘ @entity7 are the envy of the world when it comes to tight - five forwards			1
’ the intrigue will be to see whether a side with ample clout in the pack opt to adopt an arm - wrestle approach or stay true to the attacking instincts of their playmaker , @entity224 , and seek to cut loose at times			1
if so , the onus will be on recalled @entity229 centre @entity227 to provide the spark in wider channels			0
@entity51 experience is a valuable asset and @entity234 has been so alert to the issue that he has summoned @entity121 and @entity237 to start , plus @entity238 and 36 - year - old @entity239 to take places on the bench , to provide some @entity81 nous and know - how			2
composure in the cauldron will be a crucial factor , not least for the goal - kickers			2
@entity248 will need to be at the peak of his powers to match the relentlessly clinical @entity252			0
@entity253 , the visitors ’ hooker , is another who will have to keep his head , to avoid providing the @entity51 hot - shot with ammunition and spending any more time in sin - bins or disciplinary hearings			2
even if @entity7 are clear - headed and precise , it may not be enough			1
wales are favourites for a reason			1
they have the edge in big - match pedigree , and they will have the @entity15 cacophony at their backs			2
a home win is the most likely outcome			0
what that would mean in the long run , only time will tell			0
@entity224 will need to be at the peak of his powers to match the relentlessly clinical @entity252 @entity6 captain @entity25 ( right ) enters the @entity21 with coach @entity177			0

wales take on @entity7 in the @entity11 opener on friday night
few fixtures stir the blood as much as this one , it *'s* the be-all and end - all
the two teams wo *n't* meet again until the @entity1 in september
@entity69 says his side are *comfortable* with *underdogs* *tag*
wales are the favourites after beating @entity7 30 - 3 two years ago
