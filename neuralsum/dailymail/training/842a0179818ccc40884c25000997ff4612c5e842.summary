a sudden cold snap , after the humid summer , has caused millions of ladybirds to invade homes seeking warmth			1
experts had warned of an influx of a foreign species - harlequin ladybirds - which are said to pose a major threat to native ' @entity10 ' ladybirds			1
but some homes nationwide have been overwhelmed with ladybirds of all species seeking sanctuary from the cold			1
retired cleaner @entity18 , 70 , said : ' there are currently about 110 of them			1
i hope that this is it as i am running out of room for them now			2
' it 's a weird situation			1
my grandson put pictures on the internet and it is amazing how much people seem to know			1
' there used to be about 20 or 30 coming in until this year , and now i 'm wondering how many more there will be			0
' they do n't do me any harm			0
they just come in and wander around for a bit , before huddling up and going to sleep			1
' they tend to stay all winter , starting to leave in february but they are all gone by march			0
creepers : clusters of ladybirds can be seen above the door and the windows in ms @entity18 's kitchen @entity18 looks at the insects and says she ' had n't seen any all summer and now they have all appeared ' ' if it is going to be this cold , i do n't think any more will make it to the house , they are probably dying by now			1
' the funny thing is , i had n't seen any all summer in my garden and now they have all appeared			0
' ladybird expert @entity60 , of the @entity61 , said : ' the cold conditions at this time of year mean ladybirds huddle together in leaf litter or other sheltered places like houses , sheds , garages , or other outbuildings			2
' @entity70 , from @entity71 , @entity72 , is also under siege from the colourful insects			2
every time i open a window to try to get some of them out , another load come in			0
i 've never seen anything quite like it			0
' professor @entity82 , and insect biologist at @entity84 , said : ' it 's hard for us to know if there are more			1
however , anecdotally people are noticing a lot more this year			0
' the conditions that have proceeded now have been good for them			0
the more insects about the better for them			2
baby , it 's cold outside : the ladybirds have invaded ms @entity18 's home in an attempt to seek warmth ' this time of the year is when they start heading inside			1
while the cold is a factor , they are also effected by daylight			0
' they come together to keep their moisture together , nestled in a corner , away from the warm parts of the house			0
' they are not a hazard or health concern , unless you decide to eat a significant number of them			1
' if you do n't like them , you can put them back outside			0
it is early enough in the year that they will find somewhere else			0
' @entity122 ladybirds , introduced from @entity123 in 1988 , are regarded as the most invasive ladybird species on earth			1
it is larger and more aggressive than its native cousins			2
a survey group has even been set up to keep track of its spread			0
most harlequins are also carriers of the sexually transmitted disease @entity136 fungal disease that can spread to other ladybirds			2

among them is the herbivorous @entity152 , @entity154 argus , and the small brown ladybird , @entity156 , of which both are recent additions to the flying insect in @entity142			1
