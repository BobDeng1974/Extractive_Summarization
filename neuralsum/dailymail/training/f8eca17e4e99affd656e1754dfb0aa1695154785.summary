@entity0 has not slept for nearly 30 hours because he is too excited about playing at @entity1			1
his @entity3 drawl ca n’t contain the buzz at being in @entity5 and even after a long flight from the @entity7 his face is fresh and lights up every time he mentions this major championship - especially when he talks about winning it			1
@entity0 does n’t turn 21 until the end of the month but there is a real chance he could lift the @entity15 this week			1
he nearly pulled off one of the greatest wins in history at the masters , leading by two strokes in the final round before a @entity22 masterclass prevented @entity0 from breaking @entity24 ’s record as the youngest ever @entity26 champion			1
video : scroll down for @entity0 : the @entity28 was amazing for @entity7 in the zone : @entity30 @entity0 is thoroughly looking forward to @entity1 ... and feels he can win it no fear : the 20 - year - old has already shown he has all the shots in the book @entity0 announced himself to the world a year ago by becoming the first teenager to win on the @entity38 since 1931			1
he ’s already cracked into the world ’s top 10 and is all but certain to play in the @entity41 at @entity42			2
in short , @entity0 is a superstar in the making			1
if he wins at @entity5 this week , his status in @entity7 will soar into the stratosphere			1
‘ i would n’t be part of it if i did n’t think i was going to win - there would n’t be much point , right ? , ’ he says with a natural and easy grin when asked about his chances			2
despite his origins in @entity30 , @entity0 loves life by the @entity55 seaside			1
‘ it ’s better than i could have even imagined			2
it ’s such a cool town			0
the golf is incredible , ’ he gushes			0
if the present career does n’t work out , a job with @entity60 is surely his			0
but given that he has already earned $ 3.8million on the course this year , he probably does n’t need to take it			2
@entity0 has had experience of links golf from the @entity66 to his full debut at @entity68 last year			1
‘ this is what it ’s all about , this is really cool , ’ he says , grinning again			0
@entity0 thinks he has the key links shots in his armoury too			1
‘ i grew up playing in the winds of @entity30 and learnt how to flight my ball and keep it low , so that ’s a shot i ’m comfortable playing even with a driver			0
’ but @entity0 ’s ambitions stretch beyond even winning this @entity1			1
he is setting his sights on rewriting the history books			0
‘ i would love to break @entity84 ’s record of major championships and if i capture one soon then i think i ’m on the best path of anybody , ’ he says			1
hang on a second – is @entity92 ’s record of 18 major titles really a target for him ? confidence : @entity0 believes he will win this weekend ... and also has @entity92 ' 18 - majors record in his sights future in the game : @entity0 takes part in practice on a glorious day at @entity5 on wednesday ‘ yeah , ’ he responds			1
‘ i believe that each and every time i enter a tournament i have the chance to win			2
i ’m fighting as hard as i can to win			0
maybe i can win 20 ( majors ) , who knows			2
that ’s quite a stretch , everybody ’s going to laugh			0
but hopefully i ’ll enter another couple of hundred			0
’ that little @entity30 exclamation is another reason why it ’s impossible not to like @entity0			1
his bold claims contain no arrogance or bluster - he even insists there is nothing special about his golf			2
‘ there ’s nothing in my game that stands out as ridiculously good			0
i do n’t hit the ball extremely far			0
i do n’t overpower golf courses			0
my iron play is n’t the best there is			0
’ he is just a charming , engaging @entity7 kid			0
but he also happens to possess a competitive fire that could burn through wrought iron			0
@entity0 admits he was so emotional during his @entity130 debut that his hands ‘ were shaking from the moment i arrived until the end of the week			1
’ yet under the most pressure he has ever felt , @entity0 basked in the fierce duel on golf ’s grandest stage			1
learning curve : @entity0 basked under the pressure at the masters , but was ultimately beaten by @entity22 ‘ i controlled my emotions better than i could have imagined , ’ he says			1
‘ that gave me the opportunity to settle in and play my game , use the adrenaline , feed off the crowd			0
’ but how is it possible for a 20 - year - old to stay so cool ? ‘ i do n’t think of my age , ’ he insists			1
’ i do n’t think it as disadvantage or an advantage			0
i was just battling against @entity22			1
we could be doing that on his golf course on saturday afternoon but this happened to be the masters			2
’ @entity0 was ‘ stung ’ by the defeat but he has had a taste of the big time and wants more , starting this week			1
‘ winning multiple majors in a couple of years may be difficult , but i also did n’t think i ’d be here a couple of years ago			2
you never know what may happen			0
the only things i can control is doing right things off the course and working my butt off			0
‘ it ’s all about grabbing those trophies and eventually leaving a legacy i ’m proud of			0
’ watch out , @entity84			0
there are now two golfers coming for your record			2
@entity0 is an @entity178 athlete			2

@entity0 says he is aiming to break major record
@entity92 won 18 major titles , including three at @entity1
20 - year - old believes he has every chance of winning at @entity5 this week
just came short at the masters to @entity22
