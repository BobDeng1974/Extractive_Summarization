i do n't want people to come in			2
we started our project this way , and i 'd like to go until the end			0
' if other teams do it in january , good for them			1
it will not be something i will use , saying : ' these guys spend Â£ 30million more '			0
@entity0 has said that @entity4 will not buy or sell any players in the january transfer window there had been rumours that @entity25 could leave the club but that now appears unlikely ' they can spend what they want and what they can			1
hopefully everything goes okay and we have no emergency needs for january			1
' the @entity4 boss said something very similar last year only to have a busy month when the january transfer window opened with @entity38 and @entity39 leaving the club and @entity42 and @entity43 signing			1
the difference , however , is that his team are clear at the top of the @entity6 and unbeaten in 19 games as they travel to @entity48			1
when the market opens at the end of december , the onus will be on others to improve to catch the leaders			0
@entity0 's @entity4 side are six points clear at the top of the @entity6 table @entity0 said he was happy with his summer signings and did n't want to change his squad at all ' it will take some other clubs winning every match , ' said @entity0 when asked what it will take to lose the title from this position , six points clear after 12 games			1
' not every match , but win - win - win - win - win - win - win			0
with my team , i do n't believe in bad periods			0
' i believe in defeat			0
i believe there are many difficult matches ahead , with so many points to lose			1
but i do n't believe in bad moments			0
the team is a good team , a solid team			0
the players know what they want and how to reach it			2
there was an evolution in these young people , a clear evolution			2
i do n't think the group , as a group , can be complacent			0
that 's the only risk we do n't have because it 's not the profile of this group			0
