cheese made from sheep 's milk is being falsely sold as goat 's cheese in @entity6 supermarkets , according to an investigation			1
consumer watchdog which ? tested 76 samples of goats ' cheese and found that nine contained cheese from sheep milk			1
it said it became suspicious about the large amount of goats ' cheese on sale , despite a @entity19 shortage of goats ' milk and became worried goats ' cheese manufacturers could be substituting goats ' milk for other milks			2
which ? joined forces with professor @entity29 , a food safety expert at @entity31 , @entity32 , and author of the government 's independent review into the food supply network , to investigate the content of goats ' cheese			2
a new study has revealed cheese made from sheep milk is being sold in supermarkets as goat 's cheese			1
file image used they bought 76 samples of goat 's cheese from supermarkets , delis and markets from eight locations around the @entity6 and tested them to see what they really were			1
in total , nine samples were adulterated : three contained more than 80 per cent sheep 's cheese , another three contained more than 50 per cent sheep 's cheese and the final three around five per cent sheep 's cheese			1

i had actually expected to detect some adulteration with cow 's protein but what we found was substantial amounts of sheep protein in six cases			2
' when i looked into why sheep products had been used , the answer seemed to be that there is plenty of this around and the taste to most of us will be very similar and thus ' undetectable ' by the consumer			2
' in four of the six cases the goat 's cheese product was heavily contaminated with sheep protein originating from outside the @entity6			1
my message is not that all things foreign are bad , but that when supply chains are long and lack local knowledge and long term relationships there must be more opportunities for cheating and thus more checks are needed			0
this is not the first time which ? has uncovered food fraud this year			0
in may they tested lamb kebab takeaways and found that 24 out of 60 contained other meats , either chicken or beef or a mixture of both			2
and six of these contained no lamb at all			0
both chicken and beef are cheaper than lamb , so a substitution cuts costs for manufacturers and caterers			0
