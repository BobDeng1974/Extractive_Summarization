by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 14:21 est , 18 november 2012 updated : 17:33 est , 18 november 2012 the family of a nine - year - old girl who was raped and murdered in 1970 is fighting to keep the man suspected of killing her in prison - despite all evidence in the case being destroyed decades ago			1
the murder of @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 , was never solved and no one has ever been charged			1
however , @entity15 , a convicted sex offender who lived down the street of @entity11 , has confessed to her murder twice			1
he later recanted both statements and now claims he never killed the girl			2
he is currently serving the last few months of a ten - year prison sentence for sexually assaulting four children under the age of 10 between 1995 and 2002			2
cold case : @entity11 was raped and murdered at age nine in 1970			1
@entity15 , 73 , has been in prison for the last decade and has confessed to the killing -- but later recanted on monday , prosecutors will argue that a childhood neighbor and convicted sex offender - who they say confessed to the killing but has since recanted - should go to trial in the death of @entity11			1
with physical evidence in the case lost or destroyed , prosecutors say the will argue under the state 's sex offender law that @entity15 , now 73 , is sexually violent and must remain in custody indefinitely			1
a trial could finally spell the end in a lifelong journey for @entity11 's sister , @entity43 , who has been wracked with guilt about the death of her sister more than four decades ago			1
only 4 years old at the time , @entity47 knew little about the crime			2
the subject remained off - limits for the next four decades for many in a family that hoped to forget the hurt			2
but @entity47 could n't forget , and after years seeking help to solve her sister 's killing , she 's preparing to face the man police believe is responsible			2
@entity47 says that when she was a child , her sisters would scold her for talking about @entity11 , warning , ' you do n't want to make mom cry , do you ? ' most of the siblings do n't discuss it even now			1
at 15 she found the courage to go to the library and read news coverage about her sister 's death			2
every detail discovered since has helped			2
unsolved : @entity43 , right , has spent her life helping to track down the man who strangled her sister , center ' i did n't feel like so lonely , i did n't feel so empty , i did n't feel like i had a million holes anymore , ' said @entity47 , now a mother of three who lives in suburban @entity12			2
' i just started feeling like it 's easier , it 's easier , it 's easier now			2
i can talk about her now			0
i can speak her name			0
' @entity47 clearly remembers the afternoon of february 26 , 1970			1
her big sister @entity11 was reading to her from a favorite book about animals as they sat on the couch			1
her mother wanted @entity11 to go to the bakery for bread , but @entity101 purposely delayed the trip , begging for one more story			1
' i remember seeing out the window , it was getting dark and thinking " @entity106 wo n't make her go if it gets dark			0
she 'll send ( my brother ) or somebody else			0
she ca n't go , " ' @entity47 recalls			0
' we were afraid of the boogeyman and stuff back then			0
the boogeyman will get her if she goes out after dark			0
' @entity11 walked out at 5.15pm			1
a witness later saw her get into a green car			0
less than two hours later , a man discovered her bruised and bloodied body under a car in his garage about a mile away			0
newspaper reports at the time said police had people of interest , but no leads panned out			0
so investigators in 2008 began interviewing @entity15 in prison - where he was serving a 10 - year sentence for sexually assaulting four children under the age of 10 between 1995 and 2002			1
horror : @entity11 was just blocks from home when she was raped and murdered in 1970 @entity15 first told police he sexually assaulted @entity11 after she got into his car that night , according to court documents			1
she began to squirm and slapped him			0
he became angry , afraid she would tell on him			0
he strangled her and dumped her in a garage			2
it all took about 10 minutes , he said			0
in another account outlined in court documents , @entity15 said he molested @entity11 for years , picked her up and had sex with her			1
after she screamed , he put his hand over her mouth and strangled her			1
@entity15 , who is now being in held a supervised facility , has since recanted both statements			1
@entity146 said @entity15 knew specifics of @entity11 's injuries that had n't been released			1
@entity15 's attorney , @entity149 , did n't return a phone call seeking comment before monday 's hearing			1
before her mother died in 2009 , @entity47 finally asked why she needed @entity154 to go to the bakery			0
her mother said she wanted to make @entity157 toast for dinner			0
that filled a big hole			0
this year , @entity47 met the man who discovered his sister 's body - another big hole filled			0
she said she had blamed herself when she was younger for delaying her sister 's trip until after dark , but no more			0
@entity47 chokes up when talking about her gratitude for the cold case detectives who pursued the case			0
' i want to invent or create a word and i ca n't come up with anything yet that is the equivalent to how i feel , ' she said .			0
