by @entity0 published : 08:48 est , 14 november 2012 updated : 09:27 est , 14 november 2012 the @entity1 would maintain @entity3 's £ 3billion rebate and make further cuts in overall spending in its next seven - year @entity1 budget , according to its latest draft compromise drawn up ahead of a vital summit later this month.the proposals , made by @entity11 president @entity10 , could help appease @entity3 and other austerity - minded governments keen to limit their contributions to the union 's finances , as the bloc tries to reach a deal ahead of a budget meeting on november 22 and 23.but further cuts - proposed by @entity3 , @entity21 and others - to farm subsidies and development funds for poorer countries are likely to face opposition from @entity27 and former communist @entity29 states			1
@entity10 : the @entity1 president 's proposals could help to appease the @entity32 by offering the chance for it to retain £ 3billion the @entity1 pays a refund of £ 3billion back to the @entity32 on its contribution to the @entity1 budget			1
' the existing correction mechanism for the @entity32 will continue to apply , ' said a draft proposal sent to capitals late last night			0
linked rebates for @entity41 , the @entity42 and @entity21 would also remain , but @entity43 would lose its refund			0
the draft outlines further cuts of about 27 billion euros from a proposal drafted by the @entity49 @entity1 presidency at the end of last @entity49 plan already reduced the roughly 1 trillion euro ( $ 1.3 trillion ) budget proposed for 2014 - 2020 by more than 50 billion euros , meaning the overall reduction from the @entity55 's original plan now lies at about 80 billion @entity56 is unlikely to be deep enough to satisfy countries like @entity3 , @entity21 , and the @entity42 , who are pushing for cuts of between 100 - 200 billion euros to the @entity55 blueprint			0
the @entity62 's demands for a 6.8 per cent increase in spending - despite the economic crisis - saw budget talks dramatically stall yesterday			1
prime minister @entity65 has signalled his refusal to approve the 9billion euro ( £ 7.2billion ) increase , insisting the @entity1 should live within its means like families at home			2
austerity - minded : @entity65 has warned that the @entity1 can not continue to increase spending the deepest cuts in the latest proposal fall on @entity1 cohesion funds used for building motorways , bridges and other infrastructure projects in less developed regions , which have been reduced by about 17 billion euros.farm spending , which had been left largely untouched in the @entity49 compromise , is reduced by nearly 15 billion euros in the @entity10 proposal , including a cut of 8 billion euros in direct @entity84 has long threatened to oppose any plan that reduces payments to farmers , which currently account for about 40 percent of all @entity1 @entity3 , @entity21 and others would like the @entity1 to reduce spending on farm subsidies to free up funds for research , energy projects and other measures to boost economic growth			1
' the revised proposal means some small steps in the right direction but it 's not enough , ' @entity21 's @entity1 minister @entity95 said in a statement on the proposals			0
' we need a clear model for reducing agriculture subsidies			0
' the proposal from @entity10 also suggests that two - thirds of receipts from a new financial transaction tax planned by about a dozen @entity1 countries should be paid directly to the bloc 's budget , in return for an equivalent cut in those countries ' national contributions.but the idea is unlikely to win the support of the countries involved .			2

@entity10 to appease @entity117 ahead of critical meeting by offering @entity32 chance to keep £ 3billion
talks to *secure* a deal on the @entity1 budget for 2013 ahead of next week 's summit stalled yesterday as governments refused demands for extra money
the @entity62 wants to increase spending even as countries adopt *domestic* austerity measures to tackle the economic crisis
@entity65 has warned that the @entity1 must start ' living within its means '
