ministers were under growing pressure last night to toughen up measures to protect the public from ebola			1
they have already promised to review airport screening after @entity7 nurse @entity6 was allowed home despite complaining of a fever – and having her temperature checked seven times at @entity12			1
other colleagues who returned at the same time described the system at the airport as ‘ shambolic ’ and said they had to queue in cramped rooms where the virus could be passed on to others			2
@entity7 nurse @entity6 was allowed home despite complaining of a fever – and having her temperature checked seven times at @entity12 ms @entity6 ( seen centre , back ) with a group of doctors and nurses in november , as they left @entity12 for @entity26 , @entity27 experts have called for healthcare workers returning from @entity30 to be kept away from public places for at least three weeks – the time it can take for the virus to develop and for symptoms to appear			1
at the moment , they can travel home on crowded buses and trains and continue using them during the 21 - day incubation period			1
in @entity43 states such as @entity44 and @entity45 , volunteers returning from @entity30 are effectively quarantined in their own homes and must avoid public places including football matches for at least three weeks			1
@entity50 mp @entity49 , who chairs the @entity51 , said : ‘ it ’s time to review and assess the arrangements			0
‘ the government was right to bring in screening , but there are various degrees of screening			0
‘ we need to know how many people have been put in place at our borders and how many are trained – immigration officers are not equipped to deal with this			0
the government needs to be clear about who they are , what training they have received and what equipment they have at their disposal			0
‘ the home secretary needs to confirm that no immigration officers are involved in this process			1
’ dr @entity74 , of @entity75 , said quarantining might be too strict but as a compromise , returning health workers could be told to avoid public places			1
she added : ‘ the government feels pressure to act			0
‘ but in the @entity83 ebola has not until now been an issue , while in the @entity43 there was a sense of mass hysteria			0
‘ but there is a middle way we could adopt where people coming back from countries affected by ebola are told to avoid busy public places for the three - week incubation period			1
’ special care : after being put on a cocooned bed ms @entity6 was loaded on to the jet , which took off this morning and landed at @entity100 near @entity12 officials are also under pressure to change temperature tests			1
these are currently the most accurate and quickest way to diagnose the illness , because a sudden fever is one of the earliest symptoms			2
blood tests do not work because ebola can only be detected once a patient already has symptoms , such as a fever or vomiting			2
at the moment , any healthcare worker who is @entity116 ( @entity117 ) or above – compared with the normal body temperature of @entity119 ( @entity120 ) – is sent to hospital for tests			2
but one option would be to bring this down to a more precise figure such as 37.2 or @entity126			0
another would be to ensure workers remain in a secure area for at least 24 hours while they undergo repeated checks on their temperature miss @entity6 , 39 , had her temperature tested at @entity12 but then complained she had a fever while still at the airport and it was then checked a further six times over an hour but was still deemed normal			1
treatment : the nurse has been transferred to the specialist high - level isolation wing of @entity140 's @entity139 yet just 12 hours later it had rocketed and she was in an isolation unit			0
had she been made to stay at the airport this would have been picked up			0
dame @entity147 , the chief medical officer , said : ‘ clearly queuing and things like that are unacceptable and we will review			0
but we will let people who are well travel because they will not infect the public			2
’ speaking of @entity153 , she added : ‘ she was well			0
her temperature was within the acceptable range			2
she would not be transmitting the virus , therefore she was cleared as fit to fly			0
’ a @entity161 spokesman said : ‘ this person was tested as part of the screening process at @entity12 and , as with all health workers , she was advised to contact @entity166 if she had any concerns			1
‘ she did this , while still at @entity12 , and went through a further six temperature checks			1
naturally , we will be reviewing what happened and the screening protocols , and if anything needs to be changed it will be			0
’ here are some of the options that ministers wanting to bring in tougher measures to protect the public may consider : blood test this is used to confirm ebola in a patient who has symptoms			1
but scientists say it would not pick up the virus unless someone has symptoms , so would therefore be pointless			0
@entity190 currently , the process for returning healthcare workers lasts just ten minutes and involves one temperature reading and a questionnaire asking them whether they feel unwell			2
officials could make volunteers stay at the airport for 24 hours where their symptoms and temperature would be regularly monitored before they were allowed to leave			1
quarantine volunteers are allowed to use public transport and carry out daily activities – even though they may develop ebola up to 21 days after treating infected patients			1
in certain @entity43 states such as @entity210 and @entity44 , they are placed in quarantine throughout this period – either in a unit next to a hospital or in their own homes			0
some have said they felt stigmatised and treated inhumanely when they were only trying to help			0
the concern is that such strict measures would deter healthcare workers from volunteering .			2
