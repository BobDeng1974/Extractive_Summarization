by @entity0 published : 12:53 est , 7 august 2012 updated : 02:27 est , 8 august 2012 a children 's play centre has barred fathers from attending with their children and is now facing an investigation by equality watchdogs			1
@entity7 is believed to be the first such play centre in the country to introduce a ‘ women only ’ policy – which also bans boys over the age of nine			1
bosses at the centre , which opened less than a fortnight ago , claim the policy was instigated for ‘ cultural reasons ’ and was in the interests of the ‘ predominantly @entity22 ’ local community			1
the @entity25 centre 's website describes how @entity7 is the ' @entity27 's first ladies and children 's only soft play centre ' even so , yesterday @entity30 in the @entity25 suburb of @entity32 were among those who condemned the restrictions , which were advertised on a poster outside the centre			1
it reads : ‘ ladies and children only			0
no boys over nine allowed			0
’ councillor @entity41 , a @entity30 father - of - four , said it was a ‘ worrying situation ’			0
he added : ‘ there ’s something wrong when a dad ca n’t take his kids to a play centre			1
’ @entity51 , a @entity30 mother - of - one , said while @entity30 women may feel ‘ more able to relax ’ in a setting where they do n’t ‘ feel they have to cover up ’ , she thought it ‘ quite shocking in this day and age that men are n’t allowed in ’			1
another resident , who only gave her name as @entity59 , said : ‘ i have four boys , luckily all under the age of nine , but if one of them was older , i would n’t be able to take any of them			0
' it ’s not fair to leave one of them out			0
’ the children 's play group has sparked a row after it banned fathers from attending with their youngsters according to the 2001 census , @entity30 make up 54 per cent of the 30,000 population of @entity25 – more than double the number of @entity75			2
the @entity76 yesterday said that under the @entity78 , single sex rules should be ‘ the exception not the norm ’			0
the manager of @entity7 , who would not give her name , said : ‘ it ’s a predominantly @entity22 community here and we ’re catering for that			1
' it ’s not that men are an issue , ladies are more comfortable around women			2
ladies have not questioned [ the ban ]			0
they ’ve been asking for it			0
’ women and children only : no father have been allowed in the centre , according to their claims ( picture posed by models ) @entity103 , of @entity105 - based law firm @entity104 and a specialist in discrimination law , said : ‘ under the @entity78 it can be lawful to limit your services to one gender or religious group , but you must be able to “ objectively justify ” what you have done			2
‘ to my mind it would be difficult for the centre to show it has met this test when it could have offered women - only sessions or days of the week instead			2
’ an @entity76 spokesman said : ‘ the @entity78 does allow for some services to be just for women or men - only , but this is the exception not the norm and must pass a strict test to be justifiable			2
‘ we will look into why @entity7 is a women - only service			0
’ if the commission ’s lawyer considered the play centre ’s policy to be discriminatory , it would ask @entity7 to change it , the spokesman added .			1
