making whisky requires three ingredients - water , yeast and a grain , primarily barley			1
but 90 per cent of the output consists of waste by - products whisky - making can be a wasteful business			1
more than 1.6 billion litres of pot ale , and half a million metric tonnes of ‘ draff ’ are produced as by - products each year - and the majority is thrown away			1
now a firm in @entity14 wants to put this waste to good use to power our cars , feed our animals and even make plastics			1
@entity22 - based @entity21 was formed in 2011			1
it has spent the past three years refining its recycling process based on a century - old fermentation technique , and is now taking the next step toward a commercial plant , according to the @entity28			0
making whisky requires three ingredients - water , yeast and a grain , primarily barley			1
but only 10 per cent of the output is alcohol that can be sold			2
the main waste products include a residual solid called draff , and a yeast - based liquid known as pot ale			1
pot all is the copper - containing liquid created by the stills , and draff is made up of used barley grains			1
this waste is spread on agricultural lands , turned into low - grade animal feed or discarded into the sea			2
rather than inefficiently re-using these materials or letting them go to waste , @entity21 has taken an old industrial process developed to turn molasses and other sugars into chemicals , and fine - tuned it to convert draff and pot ale into acetone , biobutanol and ethanol			1
the latter two can be used as fuel			0
the company is scaling up its process with the help of the @entity65 @entity64 , private funds , and @entity67			0
and if all goes to plan , a commercial facility could be next			0
the company is initially focused on developing biobutanol - a next generation biofuel that has almost the same energy value as petrol and gasoline			1
the main waste products include a residual solid called draff , and a yeast - based liquid known as pot ale			1
@entity21 has taken an industrial process developed to turn molasses and other sugars into chemicals , and fine - tuned it to convert these products ( pictured ) into acetone , biobutanol and ethanol following the successful fermentation of the draff and pot ale ( distillery pictured ) to create biobutanol , the solid residue left is separated to produce animal feed			1
@entity21 said the feed has a high protein and is ‘ ideal for the cattle and dairy cow feed markets ' these types of fuels also produce 25 per cent more energy per unit volume than bioethanol , a fuel created from agricultural feed			2

following the successful fermentation of the draff and pot ale to create biobutanol , the solid residue left is separated to produce animal feed			1
the process also produces acetone , a widely - used chemical and solvent			2
about half of world ’s acetone is used to make acrylic plastics such as @entity128			2
it is also the starting point for other plastics such as epoxy resins and polycarbonates			0
it is easier to store , is less corrosive , and safer to handle than bioethanol , and works in unmodified engines with petrol			0
it can also be blended with diesel and biodiesel			2
biobutanol was legally recognised as a biofuel in the 2009 amendment to the @entity144			0
this is the @entity65 implementation of the @entity147 @entity146 , which dictates that 5 per cent of the @entity65 ’s transport fuel comes from a renewable source by 2013 , and 10 per cent by 2020			0

the @entity65 depends on imports of acetone , from the @entity147 and , in particular @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 and @entity167			0
in 2008 , 164,000 tonnes were imported at a cost of almost £ 100 million			0

the technology was developed by the @entity179 at @entity180 by professor @entity181 and his team			0
the research was completed in 2010 .			0

@entity195 waste products include a solid called draff , and liquid known as pot ale
@entity21 turns these *leftovers* into acetone and biobutanol
biobutanol is a more efficient *alternative* to other biofuels and can be blended with petrol and diesel
while acetone is a chemical *predominantly* used to make plastics
