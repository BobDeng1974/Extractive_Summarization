by @entity0 published : 19:01 est , 27 september 2012 updated : 07:09 est , 28 september 2012 how best after the ‘ plebs ’ crisis for ministers to demonstrate solidarity with hard - pressed @entity4 ? the answer , according to @entity6 and two @entity8 colleagues , is apparently to down tools early and go to the opera			2
the chancellor , along with education secretary @entity13 and culture minister @entity14 , took prime seats for a near - six - hour performance at the @entity17 on wednesday afternoon			1
despite the economic crisis , they all managed to knock off early to attend the 4pm start for the second instalment of @entity23 ’s @entity22			1
chancellor @entity6 ( left ) along with culture minister @entity14 ( centre ) and education secretary @entity13 ( right ) enjoyed prime seats for a performance at the @entity17 on wednesday afternoon it is sung entirely in @entity28 and lasted five hours and 50 minutes			1
yesterday , the ministerial trio risked being dubbed the ‘ three tenors of @entity34 ’ for placing their opera treat ahead of all other priorities			2
and nor could they claim to be doing their bit for the economy after it emerged they paid nothing for their seats			2
each was a freebie , gifted by the @entity17 which sent out lavish invitations to @entity44 for the sought - after performance			1
while ordinary punters had to shell out up to £ 250 for tickets - most of which sold out within an hour - the minsters were given some of the best seats in the house			0
@entity54 chief whip @entity53 has been accused of branding police officers ' plebs ' the chancellor - who famously vowed to the 2009 @entity54 conference : ‘ we ’re all in this together ’ - and his comrades were spotted in the sumptuous box of the @entity17 ’s chief executive , @entity62			1
they would have been offered complimentary fine wines and other refreshments to sustain them during the afternoon and evening			0
while his two @entity8 colleagues took front row seats in the box , mr @entity6 seemed less keen to be spotted , taking a seat behind them			0
mr @entity62 , a former senior executive at the @entity70 , invited the ministers because they had a ‘ particular interest ’ in the rare @entity23 performance , said a @entity17 spokesman			1
he said : ‘ it was an invitation from the chief executive to sit in his box			0
‘ we invite not just members of @entity80 but people from different walks of life to tell them about what we do here			0
’ the government is still reeling from another elitism crisis after chief whip @entity53 was accused of swearing at policemen in @entity89 and calling them ‘ plebs ’			0
@entity91 and mr @entity6 , who were both members of the infamous @entity94 dining club at @entity95 , have long struggled to shake off the impression they are out of touch with ordinary working @entity4			0
outspoken @entity54 mp @entity99 recently branded them both ‘ arrogant posh boys ’			0
yesterday mr @entity14 added to the impression of being a ‘ minister for fun ’ by complaining he was not allowed to have a computer games console in his office			1
in an interview with the independent newspaper , he blamed the ‘ powers that be ’ for refusing his request as inappropriate			0
‘ i was encouraged not to , in case it looked frivolous , ’ said			0
‘ but i think i will renew my campaign			0
i have a television so why ca n’t i have a games console ? ’ mr @entity14 , 44 , who says he plays the popular @entity116 game on his @entity117 and @entity118 on his @entity119 , maintains that he needs the console because the gaming industry is an important sector of the @entity4 economy			1
last night , neither the @entity124 nor the @entity125 responded to requests for comment on mr @entity6 and mr @entity13 ’s trip to the opera			1
@entity91 and mr @entity6 , who were both members of the infamous @entity94 dining club at @entity95 , have long struggled to shake off the impression they are out of touch with ordinary working @entity4 mr @entity14 ’s spokesman said : ‘ the performance ran for 5hrs 50mins including intervals , hence the earlier - than - normal start			1
’ he said that as culture minister , mr @entity14 was ‘ expected ’ to support the publicly - funded @entity17 by attending performances ‘ from time to time , as his diary allows ’			1
‘ he greatly enjoyed the production which he believes will , in time , be judged an artistic triumph and become a big earner for the company , ’ said the spokesman			2
he added : ‘ i would n’t take the comments about having a games console in his office too seriously			0
he is minister responsible for the @entity4 video games industry , which is one of our really big economic success stories in recent times , so it ’s not too surprising that he would like to be able to show off the best amongst them to visitors to his office , but having a console is not his highest priority at the moment and he would most certainly not expect public money to be spent providing one			2

the chancellor , education secretary @entity13 and culture minister @entity14 , enjoyed trip to the @entity17
all three knocked off work early to attend the 4pm start for the second instalment of @entity23 ’s @entity22
