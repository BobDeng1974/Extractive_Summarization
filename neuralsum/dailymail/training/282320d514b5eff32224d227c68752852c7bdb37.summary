' well dear readers the @entity32 has decided to call it a day ; @entity13 has simply exhausted me emotionally and physically			1
the prospect of further rapid deterioration was both terrifying and not one i wanted to entertain			0
the @entity32 decided to end her life in a manner and at a time of my choosing ; i am very clear that , whilst the law might say otherwise , i am not committing suicide			2
it has been just over eight years since the @entity32 was given the unwelcome gift of a chronic incurable degenerative disease ; one that would destroy my life slowly at first and then in leaps and bounds			2
in just over 10 years this @entity32 went from being a higher rate tax payer responsible for running a public body - ( as an aside i believe i was the youngest woman to do this at the age of 30 ) - to a position last year where i did n’t earn enough to pay tax			1
the loss of my independence both financially and physically has been extremely difficult for me			0
without the financial support of my immediate family i would have had to seek the support of the @entity88			2
whilst of course i was entitled to resort to this i found the prospect humiliating			0
pride is a terrible thing , a real burden at times of need			0
the @entity32 fortunately peaked early on life and so i do n’t leave with rafts of regrets or things i wish i ’d done			2
happy with my lot is perhaps an exaggeration but had the @entity32 persisted my ability to do things would have been daily reduced ; my potential it seems has been fulfilled			0
the values by which the @entity32 has conducted her life are clarity , integrity and wisdom with curiosity and creativity added in for @entity229			2
these principles have served the @entity32 well as i am leaving this mortal coil with a clear conscience albeit with a limited bank balance ! integrity is not a road paved with gold ! ! so live life as though it could be snatched away from you in a heartbeat , take managed risks avoiding recklessness and treat your fellow travellers with tenderness and care			1
hold your tongue at times when you risk blurting out judgemental potentially hurtful comments ; we seldom know the full back story			0
good bye and good luck ladies ( and fellow male travellers too )			0
