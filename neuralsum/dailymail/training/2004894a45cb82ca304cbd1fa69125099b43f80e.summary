by @entity0 soap bad boy : actor @entity2 has played @entity3 in @entity4 since 2000			1
he realised his lifestyle had to change after he was hospitalised due to @entity7 's disease when actor @entity2 first developed stomach cramps and intermittent diarrhoea his gp blamed @entity11 and prescribed drugs to tackle the painful gut spasms			1
for five years @entity2 , best known as bad boy @entity3 in @entity4 , dutifully took the drugs , although they did n’t seem to have much effect			1
then @entity2 moved from his home in @entity17 to @entity18 and his symptoms worsened abruptly			1
he started also suffering from episodes of vomiting - within just a couple of months , he lost over three stone , plummeting to under nine stone , terribly thin for his 6ft frame			0
‘ i was weak and i looked terrible , ’ recalls @entity2 , ‘ i remember looking in the mirror and thinking grimly that even if i survived , this was not a good look for someone trying to carve out an acting career			1
’ his new gp referred him for tests at @entity32 – there a consultant broke the news that @entity2 had crohn ’s disease , an auto - immune condition which causes the gastrointestinal tract to become inflamed , triggering symptoms including stomach pain , diarrhoea , vomiting , abcesses and even arthritis			1
it was a shocking diagnosis – not least because when he was nine , @entity2 ’s mother had died following a long battle with the very same disease			1
‘ i was absolutely terrified , ‘ admits @entity2			1
‘ i was very close to my mum , and her death left a big gap in my life			0
now all i could think of was that i was going to die too			0
’ an estimated 120,000 @entity52 suffer from @entity7 ’s			1
it ’s thought to occur when the immune system mistakes bacteria normally found in healthy intestines for invading substances			0
it sends white cells to attack the ‘ rogue ’ bacteria – these white cells also cause inflammation which damages the surrounding tissue			0
although @entity7 ’s can involve any area of the digestive tract from the mouth to the anus , it most commonly affects the small intestine and / or colon			1
unfortunately it ’s not unusual for @entity7 ’s disease to go undiagnosed for some time , explains @entity73 , director of information and support at the charity @entity7			1
‘ crohn ’s disease and @entity77 , which both come under the umbrella term of @entity79 ( @entity79 , ) share a few characteristics with the much more common @entity11 ( @entity11 ) such as diarrhoea , ' she said			2
‘ however , anyone whose bowel symptoms are accompanied by unexplained weight loss , or who is experiencing rectal bleeding should be referred to a hospital for further investigation			0
a simple blood test can flag up indicators of @entity7 ’ s such as anaemia , or inflammatory markers			1
a family history of irritable bowel disease is also significant , as there is a known hereditary element			2
’ as soon as @entity2 was diagnosed , his father - also called @entity2 - made a point of explaining that his mother ’s death was actually caused by complications following an operation for her @entity7 ’s rather than the disease itself			1
@entity2 is a heated scene from @entity4 : he goes running three times a week and eats healthily to manage his relapsing and remitting condition indeed @entity2 ’s consultant reassured him that his condition was treatable – in many cases , patients manage with steroids , which prevent the destructive inflammation			1
however @entity2 needed surgery immediately to remove the diseased part of his bowel			1
the bowel is 6m long , and so can still function normally with a small section removed however @entity2 was warned that depending on what surgeons found and how much of the tract was affected , he might need a colostomy bag , perhaps @entity125 , then 25 , was stunned			1
‘ having a colostomy bag at any age is a big deal , but at that age , it ’s almost impossible to contemplate , ’ he says			0
he also felt nervous about telling his partner @entity131 , who also now stars in @entity4 as @entity132			0
‘ we ’d met two years previously , at drama college			0
i knew i wanted to spend the rest of my life with her			0
but naturally , i was scared that the idea of a colostomy would put her off			0
’ however , @entity131 , who ’d previously worked as a nurse , was unfazed			0
‘ she was brilliant , ’ remembers @entity2			2
‘ she just hugged me and said whatever happened , we ’d cope with it , together			0
’ after surgery lasting several hours , @entity2 came round to discover that surgeons had successfully removed the scarred part of his bowel - and there was no colostomy bag			2
‘ i was so relieved i could have cried , ’ he says			0
@entity2 was in hospital for 12 days , and given steroids and an anti inflammatory drug			2
he spent the next few months regaining his strength , and for the next few years , lived a normal life , with only very mild stomach cramping and occasional brief bouts of diarrhoea - going back to the hospital for regular checkups			0
@entity2 felt so well that he allowed himself to think that his condition had somehow disappeared			1
however , @entity7 ’s is what ’s known as a ‘ relapsing and remitting ’ disease , meaning that symptoms can die down for long periods of time and then flare up again			1
and in 2002 , six years after @entity2 ’s operation , things took a sudden and dramatic turn for the worse			1
‘ @entity131 was appearing in a play at the @entity169 , and i ’d taken my dad and step mum to see it			0
i ’d been feeling off colour for a couple of days , and during the interval , as i went to get some drinks , i suddenly felt dizzy and collapsed			0
’ @entity2 was rushed to hospital with severe haemorrhaging from his back passage			1
the bleeding stemmed from the original operation site in his bowel , although doctors could n’t say why it had happened			0
after more treatment with steroids , he again recovered well - but @entity2 describes that episode as something of an epiphany			2
‘ i realised that @entity7 ’s would always be with me			1
and that i owed it to myself , as well as to @entity131 and everyone who loved me , to start really taking care of myself			0
i knew that smoking and drinking alcohol – both of which i ’d been doing - are both inflammatory , and can exacerbate the symptoms of @entity194			2
’ @entity2 with his wife , actress @entity131 , who he says has been a huge support with @entity131 ’s support , @entity2 stopped smoking , cut right down on his alcohol intake and tried to eat as healthily as possible , completely avoiding convenience and processed foods			1
but despite this , he was hospitalised again , a few months later , with a blocked bowel			0
a five day stay in hospital and some medication sorted this out ; then doctors suggested putting @entity2 on a drug called @entity211 , which helps keep symptoms at bay by suppressing the immune system			2
but he and @entity131 were concerned by the possible side effects which range from a cough and fatigue to shortness of breath and muscle pain			0
they were also starting to think about having a family , and worried that the drug might impact on @entity2 ’s fertility - although there ’s currently no evidence that this is the case			2
‘ we decided to look into other ways of managing my @entity7 ’s , ’ says @entity2			1
with the help of a nutritionist , @entity2 discovered that going on a wheat , dairy sugar and alcohol free diet for short periods at a time helps his symptoms and energy levels - he avoids coffee and monosodium glutamate , which he says aggravate his condition			1
he is no longer on any medication but takes aloe vera juice ( said to ease digestion ) , pro-biotics ( to restore the good bacteria in the gut ) and a herbal supplement called @entity249 , derived from the @entity251 potato plant ( said to support the immune system )			0
@entity2 , who has been working on @entity4 since 2000 , does n’t have much free time , but makes sure he goes running three times a week			2
‘ it ’s a great stress reliever , ’ he says			0
‘ which is great , because stress is known to make @entity7 ’s symptoms worse			2
’ in august 2003 , @entity2 and @entity131 married , and are now the proud parents of @entity260 , five , and @entity261 , three			2
the family live in @entity263			0
‘ i know @entity7 ’s has a hereditary link , and of course i ’ve thought about the possibility of my children having it ’ , says @entity2			1
‘ but i prefer not to dwell on it , and rather think positive			0
’ ‘ it took me a while to accept that i had a lifelong condition , and the same illness my mum had , ’ says @entity2			1
‘ but i know that @entity275 would n’t have wanted me to dwell on it , rather to be strong and get on with my life			0
now i feel that i manage it well			0
‘ i ’d say to anyone newly diagnosed with @entity7 ’s : educate yourself about the condition , and understand that although it ’s not curable , it is treatable			1
and then find what works for you			0
’ @entity7 ’s and @entity284 , telephone 0845 1303344 for further information on @entity249 go to @entity287			2
