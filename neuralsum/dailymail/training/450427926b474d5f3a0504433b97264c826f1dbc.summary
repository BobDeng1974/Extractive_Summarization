by @entity0 it 's not easy finding a campsite with a river view , but the owner of this caravan may have taken things a bit far			2
the vehicle reversed straight over a grassy bank and into the water behind a motorway service station			2
the stranded caravan was spotted today near the @entity13 in @entity14 by photographer @entity15 - who said its owner may have been stopping for a cup of coffee			1
carry on reversing : this caravan 's owner may have been a bit too keen to get a river view behind a service station on the @entity13 in @entity14			1
photographer @entity15 said : ' people park up for a flask of coffee ' picnic gone wrong ? the caravan was left dangling precariously with one corner in the @entity31 river the 44 - year - old saw the vehicle in the @entity30 next to a tiny , single - track lane between @entity36 services on the @entity13 and the village of @entity38			1
' you get people who park up to have a flask of coffee and just look at the water , ' he said			1
' it looks like someone 's been passing and got a bit too close to the edge			0
' it could 've been stolen or fly - tipped but i do n't know why someone would go to all the effort to get it into the river			0
' mr @entity15 , from nearby @entity54 , added : ' i 'm surprised they managed it because it 's been very dry since the floods			2
the bank should n't have been too slippery for them			0
shall i leave it here ? the caravan was abandoned hanging partly into the river and with the door left open ' there are a lot of farm vehicles that go along there so it may also have crashed by backing up and trying to let something past			0
' @entity70 has been told about the caravan and was preparing to remove it , he added .			0
