by @entity0 the @entity2 foreign affairs ministry has said that allegations of rape and child abduction made against two of its diplomats were made by their wives in a bid to help their asylum applications			1
two unnamed foreign diplomats working at @entity2 's @entity12 in @entity13 , west @entity14 , were respectively accused of rape and child abduction in an annual statement released this week by the @entity17			1
the allegations - which the @entity2 @entity12 has labelled as ' sketchy ' - were among 14 ' serious and significant ' offences alleged to have been committed this year by diplomatic staff based at embassies in @entity22			1
two diplomats based in @entity2 's embassy in @entity14 have respectively been accused of rape and child abduction , but their home country claims the allegations were made by their wives in a bid to stay in the @entity22 the @entity17 revealed it had asked @entity2 for the officials ' diplomatic immunity - which stops embassy staff being prosecuted by their host nation - to be lifted			1
but the @entity2 foreign affairs ministry has now said that allegations were only made against the diplomats by their spouses when matrimonial relations ' became tense '			1
spokesman @entity38 said that , in the alleged rape case , the woman had made the allegation when she wanted to settle permanently in @entity22 but her husband refused			1
according to the @entity44 , in a weekly press briefing she said : ' matrimonial relations between the couple became tense as she wanted to settle in the @entity22 permanently while her husband was not inclined			1
on his refusal , she levelled these charges			0
' according to ms @entity38 , that same woman also alleged her husband had abducted their children			2
but ms @entity38 said those claims arose when the woman was unable to look after her older children - due to giving birth to another child prematurely - and they were returned to family members without her permission			2
ms @entity38 claimed a similar set of circumstances for the alleged child abduction case			2
she added : ' so , in both cases [ the ] allegations seem to be motivated by desire to seek asylum			0
' in a statement , the @entity12 said : ' the cases have their roots in the long standing family disputes where a member of the family had complained against the spouse			0
' the @entity12 for @entity2 is contesting the veracity of these allegations with the @entity17 while taking full cognizance of its obligations under the @entity79			2
' the allegations emerged after the @entity17 , pictured , released its annual list of diplomats who had been accused of ' serious and significant ' criminal offences earlier this week , foreign officer minister @entity84 revealed the @entity22 had asked for immunity to be lifted in five of the 14 ' serious ' cases			1
the @entity17 defines serious offences as those which would carry a sentence of more than 12 months if a conviction was secured			0
under the @entity79 , diplomatic staff are expected to obey the laws of their host nation but are also granted immunity from prosecution			2
this can only be waived by their own country			0
but if a country refuses to lift that immunity , the host nation can not stop the accused from leaving			1
the @entity17 did not say whether its requests for immunity to be lifted in the @entity2 cases had been successful			2

in at least one of the 14 cases , investigations by @entity122 are still ongoing			0
in a written statement to mps , @entity84 said : ' some 21,500 people are entitled to diplomatic immunity in the @entity22 and the majority of diplomats abide by @entity22 law			1
' the number of alleged serious crimes committed by members of the diplomatic community in the @entity22 is proportionately low			1
' under the @entity79 1961 , those entitled to immunity are expected to obey the law			0
the @entity17 does not tolerate foreign diplomats breaking the law			0
' we take all allegations of illegal activity seriously			0
when instances of alleged criminal conduct are brought to our attention by the police , we ask the relevant foreign government to waive diplomatic immunity where appropriate			1
' for the most serious offences , and when a relevant waiver has not been granted , we seek the immediate withdrawal of the diplomat			0
' amongst the other allegations was one count of driving a vehicle reported as lost or stolen and without insurance , against a @entity157 official			0
