when @entity4 , now 64 , was sent to live in @entity5 aged two , the @entity1 nuns who put her on the boat thought they were sending her to a better life			1
tragically , nothing could have been further from the truth for not only was her adoptive father @entity10 violent , he was a predatory paedophile as well			1
now ms @entity4 has questioned why nothing was done to help her - and why checks that would have revealed @entity10 's desire for children , were not done			1
tragedy : @entity4 was handed to a paedophile by nuns who ran the baby home where she was born innocent : @entity4 pictured as a little girl around the time of her adoption by a couple in @entity26 one of an estimated 60,000 children forcibly given up for adoption by nuns running the @entity33 's mother and baby homes in the 1950s and 60s , ms @entity4 was a toddler when she was torn from her mother @entity35 's arms and sent to start a new life			1
' my mother was a fallen woman , ' says ms @entity4 , who now lives in @entity40			1
' i really do not remember a lot [ about the actual moment ]			2
' but even though you 're so young , you still have feelings			2
you remember being ripped away even if you do n't remember the physicalities of it			2
' to the outside world , her new family appeared perfect for a lonely child taken from her mother and transported more than 5,000 miles away to @entity26			1
@entity4 's new father , @entity51 , was a prosperous businessman and well - respected in the local community , while her mother was a kind and decent woman			1
' she was indeed a nice person , ' adds ms @entity4			1
her father , however , was a different story entirely			2
' when i first got there , i would often be ill , ' she says of her early years with the family			2
' i would have all kinds of allergies and break out because i was allergic to the food			0
' but worse was to come			0
' my memories [ of childhood ] are terrible , ' ms @entity4 says , sadly			1
' i was physically punished for not being able to eat			0
' if i did what a little child does and wet the bed , then i was literally put in the toilet			0
then the sexual abuse started and it just progressed			1
' i had to be kept in my little routine as it were , so i tried to break away			0
it was very serious paedophile thinking			2
' with the @entity76 keeping up appearances in front of friends and neighbours , the bewildered little girl found herself alone and with no one to turn to			0
scandal : @entity33 's historic adoption scandal was compounded by the recent discovery of a mass grave at @entity86 @entity87 : more than 2000 children were sent to families in @entity5 by nuns during the 1950s and 60s ' i could not perceive of any way of doing something and i had to protect myself			1
because if i had said something and it had come to light , then i probably would not have lived another day			0
' and that is not an exaggeration			0
he had the world fooled			0
' the abuse lasted throughout her childhood with @entity4 fleeing her abusive family as soon as she was old enough			1
but the impact of her traumatic childhood - and the battle to find her real mother that came after - have left her scarred			2
worse still was living with the knowledge that nuns handling the adoption failed to speak to mr @entity10 beforehand and indeed make any sort of inquiries at all			1
in the event , only mrs @entity114 was investigated by adoption agencies , with her very niceness inadvertently resulting in @entity4 's nightmarish childhood			1
tragic : many of the so - called fallen women to give birth at the homes had their children taken without consent adoption : between 40,000 and 60,000 children were given up for adoption by nuns during the 50s and 60s ' i think if they did proper vetting , i would n't have been placed in that household , ' she says			2
' how do i feel now ? well , it 's been a lot to overcome			0
' i still have flashbacks sometimes and i still struggle with substance abuse occasionally			2
and i have been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder			1
' although ms @entity4 did eventually find her birth mother , it was n't until she was 52 that she was able to come to @entity143 to meet her			1
' well , that was quite a moment when we first met , ' she smiles			0
' i went up to her and i hugged her and she froze			0
so it came through to me that i needed to tread lightly			0
' tragically , her mother 's shame at being an unwed parent followed her to @entity143 and ms @entity4 says she was very reluctant to admit the truth to her @entity153 family			1
' it was very clear that i was to keep my mouth shut			0
that i was a secret			0
that i was a long lost cousin			0
i did play along even though it was hard			0
but some people did guess			0
' the pair had just 10 years together , with @entity4 's mother @entity35 dying in 2010			1
' it 's just unfortunate that she had to take so much shame to her grave , ' she adds			0
' it just is n't right			0
' @entity4 's story appears on this world : @entity33 's @entity167 , tonight at 9pm on @entity168			1

@entity4 , 64 , was two when she was adopted by a @entity5 couple
she was born to an *unmarried* mother in an @entity153 baby home run by nuns
nuns failed to vet parents and her father proved to be a paedophile
suffered years of sexual abuse and has post-traumatic stress disorder
eventually *reunited* with mother @entity35 , who has since died , aged 52
