by @entity1 reporter published : 10:21 est , 6 july 2013 updated : 10:21 est , 6 july 2013 anticipation of the return of @entity4 to supermarket shelves this month has been marred by the decision to freeze them as it could threaten the product ’s integrity			2
the freezing of the popular all - american pastries has been confirmed by the manufacturer company , @entity13 , which said in a statement to @entity15 that the decision was made due to requests from their retail customers			1
the statement said it will allow the retailers to ‘ date the product for freshness ’ while giving them ‘ flexibility in filling their shelves ’			2
frozen treat : some of the new @entity4 will be frozen and then defrosted before they reach the shelves back on shelves : the last twinkie was snapped up in 2012 , but they are back again on july 15 the plan is to bake the goodies at five plants and freeze them before shipping them through independent drivers to supermarket warehouses , according to sources			1
stores would defrost them and restock the shelves as needed			0
however , according to the @entity42 , some people fear the new freezing process could threaten the product ’s future popularity and integrity			0
a common urban legend claims that @entity4 - a sponge cake with white creamy filling - have an infinite shelf life , or can last unspoiled for a relatively long time , due to the chemicals used in their production			1
this urban legend is false , although @entity4 can last a relatively long time because they are made without dairy products and thus spoil more slowly than most bakery items			0
twinkies are in fact on the shelf for a short time , according to a company executive who told the @entity59 in 2000 that the @entity4 is on the shelf ' no more than 7 to 10 days '			0
@entity4 ' myth of having a long shelf life has been referenced in films and television shows such as @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , ghost rider : @entity68 , and @entity69			0
end of an era : @entity71 , ceo of @entity13 which makes @entity4 , filed for bankruptcy in early 2012 iconic : twinkies will be back on shelves this month as per popular demand but @entity13 denies the decision to freeze the cakes before they hit the shelves will have any impact			1
‘ any suggestion that @entity13 is changing the integrity of the iconic snack cakes consumers have loved is completely untrue , ’ said @entity13 spokeswoman , @entity79			2
‘ the new ownership is absolutely committed to baking top quality snack cakes and , in fact , is making major investments to ensure that @entity13 products are as good , if not even better , than before , ’ she said			2
@entity13 filed for bankruptcy in early 2012 , after an acrimonious fight with its unionised workers last year			0
it is now back up and running under new owners and a leaner structure under investment firm @entity95 who swooped in to buy twinkies and other @entity13 snacks in 2013			1
based on the outpouring of nostalgia sparked by its demise , @entity13 is expecting a blockbuster when it returns to shelves on july 15 with its twinkies and other sugary treats , such as @entity106 and @entity107			1
the twinkie was invented in @entity109 , in 1930 .			0

the sponge cake will be frozen and then defrosted before it hits shelves for those retailers who request it
twinkies will be back in shops on july 15
freezing the cake will give retailers ' flexibility ' says manufacturer , @entity13
