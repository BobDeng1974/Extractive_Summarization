from @entity2 pink salt to quinoa , it seems the trendiest groceries are no longer just for our kitchens but also for our bathrooms , as high - end beauty brands try to convince us that swanky superfoods can benefit us from the outside - in , as well the inside - out			1
but at such extortionate prices , could you make your own beauty products from these foods — and would they be any good ? using recipes from reputable websites , @entity15 gave it a go , and asked leading dermatologists dr @entity20 and dr @entity22 for their verdicts			1
now , fashionable brands such as @entity37 company @entity36 are using it in their body scrubs , with devotees claiming it stimulates circulation , reduces inflammation and can help with bloating			2
but could i get the same results for less than the £ 42 it would cost me to buy @entity36 ’s @entity48 ? recipe : for a himalayan pink salt scrub , mix two parts @entity28 ( around £ 4 for 500g from healthfood stores ) , one part almond oil ( around £ 5 for 200ml from healthfood stores ) , lemon zest and fresh thyme leaves			1
verdict : this scrub left my skin feeling fresh , stimulated and nicely moisturised			2
my friends will know what to expect for @entity61 ! dr @entity22 says : ‘ there is no scientific evidence that using pink salt topically can achieve any kind of “ detox ” for your skin			2
mixed with oil and used as a scrub , it will exfoliate — but i would n’t anticipate any benefits other than that			1
’ @entity75 @entity25 tries an orange moisturising face mask with quinoa which is hailed as a supergrain , buttechnically a seed hailed as a supergrain , quinoa is technically a seed			1
it comes in three forms — red , white and black — and is high in protein , a source of zinc , magnesium , manganese and iron , and free of gluten ( so it ’s good for coeliacs )			2
now , it has popped up in a moisturiser by @entity98 brand @entity96			2
their @entity99 costs £ 32 and claims to be packed with vitamins and minerals to hydrate your skin			2
i decided to try out a quinoa face mask			1
recipe : combine a handful of quinoa ( around £ 2 for 300g from supermarkets ) with the juice of an orange , three tablespoons of natural yoghurt and two tablespoons of honey			1
stir until blended and thick enough to apply to your face			0
leave for 15 minutes , then rinse with warm water			0
verdict : disaster ! use too much yoghurt and the stuff runs off your face , but use too little and the quinoa soaks up the yoghurt , leaving the consistency of concrete			1
by the time i ’d got the stuff to stick to my face , i had clumps of quinoa up my nose and a kitchen and bathroom that looked as though they ’d been pebble - dashed ! dr @entity20 says : ‘ while you might get minimal exfoliating effect from rubbing quinoa against your skin , i have not seen any data that shows your skin would receive significant benefit from applying quinoa in a homemade preparation			1
’ @entity145 full of healthy fats and potassium , avocado is n’t the newest of health foods , but it ’s a firm favourite			1
due to its high oleic acid content ( a fatty acid said to make hair thicker and shinier ) it ’s found in many conditioning hair products by brands such as @entity157 and @entity158 , as well as in @entity160 ’s @entity159 , £ 19			1
@entity162 beauty fans recommend avocado treatments for dry , brittle hair because of its high vitamin and oil content			1
recipe : for an avocado hair conditioner , mix one avocado ( around £ 1 ) , two tablespoons of honey and a tablespoon of avocado oil ( around £ 5 for 250ml ) in a blender until smooth			1
@entity174 hair and apply mixture			0
cover with a plastic cap and leave for 20 minutes			0
@entity145 hair conditioner was one of the more successful homemade recipes that @entity25 tried verdict : despite only using a small amount , my hair felt very nice and soft afterwards			0
given the amount i ’ve spent on conditioner over the years , i ’d definitely try this again			0
dr @entity22 says : ‘ @entity145 is a skin - friendly food , as it contains lots of mono - unsaturated fat , as well as vitamins , minerals and antioxidants			0
but whether these would penetrate skin when applied topically is a different question			0
‘ it may have some benefit in making the hair shaft smoother , but this will be a temporary benefit , as there is no scientific evidence it does anything for scalp health			0
’ @entity25 gives coconut deodorant a go @entity209 the world has gone coconut oil crazy , with cooks switching butter or extra virgin oil for the super-oil that is said to boost cholesterol and have antibacterial properties			1
fans say it can also be used as anything from mouthwash to moisturiser and one brand , @entity224 , has even created a coconut deodorant for £ 8.50			2
recipe : to make your own coconut oil deodorant , mix four tablespoons each of baking soda and arrowroot , then use a fork to mash in six teaspoons of coconut oil ( around £ 2 for 500ml at supermarkets and healthfood stores ) , which is solid at room temperature			1
a few drops of essential oil will add scent			2
mould into an empty deodorant stick , if you have one , or a shot glass works just as well			0
if the homemade stick gets floppy and difficult to work with , add a little more of the powdered ingredients			0
verdict : although this is a natural deodorant , it is not an antiperspirant ( to prevent wetness ) , so if sweating is an issue , this wo n’t suit			0
nevertheless , this worked better than i expected			0
i wore it out running , and found i did n’t smell afterwards			0
it also softened my underarm skin			0
dr @entity22 says : ‘ coconut oil does have anti-inflammatory properties when used on skin , so it can protect , soothe , hydrate and strengthen the skin ’s barrier function			1
