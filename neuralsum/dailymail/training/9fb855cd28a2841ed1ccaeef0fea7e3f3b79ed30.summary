both the @entity73 and no campaigns have tried to use the subject of family to win over voters			2
the pro-union better together campaign urged people to vote against breaking up the @entity84 if they love their family			0
their posters have carried slogans including : ‘ we love our kids , we ’re saying no thanks ’ , ‘ i love my family , i ’m saying no thanks ’ and ‘ i love @entity7 , i ’m saying no thanks ’			0

at yesterday ’s rally , former @entity7 rugby international @entity101 said the players had become involved in the campaign because of mr @entity8 ’s suggestion that patriotic @entity7 would vote @entity73			1

’ @entity7 rugby legends gathered at @entity12 today to pledge their support of the @entity160 campaign mr @entity145 , 52 , said he had no wish ever to go into politics			1
good grief , no. he had organised this event with @entity165 ( 70 caps ) and @entity167 ( 61 caps in a blue and occasionally blood - spattered jersey as fullback )			1
they did it by themselves and told the @entity175 strategists they could make what they wanted of it			0
this was the voice of the rugby clubhouse speaking , plain as that – though the @entity3 is having to maintain an impartial stance			2
‘ we could do with fewer politicians , ’ said @entity14 , who played on the ( right ) wing for @entity7 in the early 1980s			1
alluding to the @entity2 ’s leader and his deputy , mr @entity14 added : ‘ the trouble with @entity8 and @entity9 is they do n’t have kids so they do n’t understand parents ’ fears about the next generation			1

if you walk down @entity199 wearing a no badge , things can get pretty aggressive			0
’ it is hard to imagine any ‘ aye ’ types in @entity199 wanting to get itchy with 17 - stone , 6ft 6in @entity205 , who at the age of 44 still has the @entity208 jaw and corrugated nose of a man who has witnessed a few haymakers at the bottom of a ruck			2

@entity205 said walking down the street in @entity199 wearing a no badge could be difficult			0
somehow its hard to imagine the @entity229 types wanting to get itchy wit 6ft 6in @entity205 , pictured handing off an opponent @entity233 asserted gravely that he was a ‘ passionate @entity238 ’ and had answered the call to do this photocall in ‘ the blink of an eye ’ because he felt so strongly about the @entity3			0
an older chap introduced himself as @entity240 , who played no 8 for @entity7 in the early 1960s			0
‘ i was three inches taller in those days , ’ he said			0
the lads agreed happily that they had punched plenty of @entity122 in their time , but after a game they would all have friendly beers with the boys in white			0
your sketchwriter fulfilled a boyhood dream and met @entity37 , @entity7 ’s star player in the 1970s			0
now a 62 - year - old property developer , he was still instantly recognisable as the fullback with the golden boot			2
‘ i genuinely believe in this cause , ’ he said , eyes blazing			0
‘ i hope peace and harmony break out because it would be tragic for the wounds of this referendum to fester			0
’ later , @entity260 walked a couple of hundred yards down @entity13 ’s @entity261 , popping into shopfronts to talk to employees			0
there was no trouble , though one frail , well - spoken socialist lady told him she was ‘ very disappointed in him ’			2
octogenarian @entity268 ( she did not wish to vouchsafe her surname ) told me she had already done a postal vote – for yes – but might have changed her mind if she had met @entity274 earlier			0
‘ he ’s too late , ’ she said			0
at which point we all did an about - turn and trooped back in the other direction because a spin doctor had spotted that mr @entity260 was about to walk past an @entity282 sex shop			2
if he had put his head in there to talk to the staff , his eyes might have popped out on sticks .			0
