like many professional athletes , @entity0 has decided to move into the hospitality industry with a huge new restaurant set to be opened this year			1
but it appears to have already hit a speed bump , with project developer @entity6 revealing it can not be named ' @entity0 ' because @entity8 owns the rights to the golfer 's full name			1
he made the claims when asked in an interview about the @entity16 project 's clunky name - the @entity0 @entity17 : sports and @entity19			1
@entity0 is unable to name his restaurant after himself because @entity8 owns the rights to his name , the project developer has claimed in an interview with @entity25 , he said he was told that ' @entity8 has the rights to the name @entity0 ' , adding that even gaining permission to use @entity0 ' name in a press release was ' over the top '			1
however , @entity0 ' manager @entity31 has contradicted the claims , saying @entity8 does not own the rights to his client 's name			1
he said : ' i ca n't imagine how this could have been communicated this way			0
it is wholly inaccurate and categorically false ' , golfchannel.com reported			0
' @entity0 owns his own name and always had			0
' a @entity8 spokesperson supported this , denying the corporation owned the rights to the name @entity0			1
developer @entity45 and @entity47 previously said the property is expected to be a 5,900 - square - foot restaurant , likely to open in early 2015			2
woods said he envisions ' a place where people can meet friends , watch sports on tv and enjoy a great meal			0
' i wanted to build it locally where i live and where it could help support the community			0
' the restaurant will be located in a new shopping center development called @entity65 , which is set to open in full in october			2
the $ 150million development will feature an amphitheater , marina , restaurants and shops and @entity0 says he 's had his eyes on the property for two years			0
mr @entity6 said : ' i could n’t be more excited to have @entity0 ’s new establishment operating within @entity75 , ' the @entity73 reported			2
' it ’s gratifying to see the final stages met with support from local , national and international organizations such as mr @entity0			0
' the amphitheater inside @entity65 , the @entity16 development which is set to house @entity0 ' new restaurant			2

restaurant developer claims they were unable to use golfer 's full name
@entity6 said it was *due* to @entity8 owning rights to @entity0 ' name
the *sprawling* 5,900sq ft restaurant is set to open in april or may this year
however , @entity0 ' manager and @entity8 have denied the developer 's claims
