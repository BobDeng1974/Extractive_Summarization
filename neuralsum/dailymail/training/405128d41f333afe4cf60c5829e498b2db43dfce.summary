a group of women sitting outside @entity2 look shocked			1
they ’re turning around to see who is screaming at the top of their voice , disturbing their quiet lunch			1
i would look around , too , but i ’m incapable of turning — or stopping for that matter			1
i also know exactly who is disturbing the peace — it ’s me , hurtling through the shopping centre , gathering speed , narrowly missing pensioners and office - workers on their break			1
in truth , i ’m probably barely hitting 10mph , but that ’s how it feels on this hare - brained contraption called the @entity23 — a kind of electric unicycle			1
this new must - have has been flying off the shelves at @entity27 , has sold out at various outlets online and is , apparently , going to transform the way we travel			1
with nothing to hold on to , mastering the @entity23 is far from easy			1
yet the promotional videos show people whizzing through their office reception area or flying along city streets on their wheel , holding a coffee			1
they ’ve sold 300,000 of the @entity58 - made machines since the launch last year			1
walking , it seems , is so last century			2
unfortunately , i do n’t have a good track record of being in charge of wheels			1
when i tried riding a bike for the first time in years , i went flying off after hitting a pothole			2
i am such a nervous driver that , despite having passed my test 20 years ago , i still wo n’t go on the motorway			2
yet here i am on a wheel , with no brakes , no steering column and no safety belt			2
what could possibly go wrong ? setting off can be difficult for the new user my adventure began at the company ’s base in @entity81 , @entity35 , where the team showed me the ropes			1
the makers say you can get the basics in a couple of hours , and be proficient in a day or two			1
you turn it on via a button on the wheel			2
the idea is that you stand your feet on two pedals either side of the wheel and simply lean forward to move , back to stop and left and right to turn			2
sounds simple — but it is n’t			2
just getting on is impossible			2
it ’s so unstable , i need to lean on @entity99 , one of the @entity23 team			1
the instructions suggest leaning against a wall at the beginning , but i find a handsome @entity105 man always works better			2
and when i say lean , i mean cling on for dear life			2
even though the pedals are only three inches off the ground , i am terrified			2
i feel as wobbly as you ’d expect from a novice on a unicycle			2
@entity112 seems impossible and for half an hour i do more squealing than a teenage girl at a @entity115 concert			0
after mastering standing on the @entity23 , the next ‘ step ’ is to start moving for a respectable distance			1
a tiny tilt forward and it starts to move			0
the more you press the faster it goes			0
i feel like i ’m four years old when @entity123 took the stabilisers off my bike — i ’m trundling along but i just want to get off			0
@entity99 and his friend hold on to me , on either side , as they try to move down the path			0
i keep shrieking and they keep telling me to ‘ relax ’			0
i feel so scared that i keep jumping off			0
the trick , apparently , is to stand straight and look in the direction you ’re going in — but i keep looking at my feet , which makes me wobble			0
finally , after 20 minutes , the boys lighten their grip and , bit by bit , i find that i ’m doing it on my own			0
it feels thrilling , fast , and dare i say it fun			0
i get confident enough to up the speed — the faster you go the more steady you feel , like a bike			0
the cold air is rushing through my hair and actually , i love it			0
but after a few minutes , it is possible to safely navigate on the high - tech device which is imported from @entity58 there is only one problem : stopping			1
you ’re supposed to be able to slow down enough that you simply step off and grab hold of the wheel before it falls but going slowly means wobbling , so i panic and jump off instead			0
as for turning , the theory is you simply lean in whatever direction you want to go , but every time i try , i panic and jump off			0
@entity99 tells me it can take a few days to get the hang of that , so for now the @entity23 and i will be going in a straight line only			1
@entity99 boasts he regularly goes shopping on his @entity23 and even navigates the @entity167 on it			1
inspired by his claims , i decide to give the @entity23 a go on a busy pedestrianised street			1
there are people , and benches , and broken glass , and i am on edge			0
there are shop windows to bang into , signs to knock over , children to injure			0
fortunately , those in my path are all taking one look at me and stepping far away			0
and you do get looks on this thing			0
a bloke munching on a sausage roll says : ‘ you ’re not gon na lose any weight on that , are you ? ’ @entity188			0
i ’d turn and mow him down , but i do n’t know how			0
i ’m like a beginner on a ski slope : i can not move out of your way , so you ’ve got to move out of mine			0
the @entity23 will travel up to 24 miles on one charge			1
and although at 13kg ( 28lb ) , it feels like carrying a very heavy brick , it ’s about the same weight as a fold - up bike			1
the makers say people are buying them for dog walking , shop runs and days out			1
their youngest user is ten and their eldest is 70			1
seventy ! meanwhile , the gadget is getting rave reviews online and i can see why			0
it ’s fun , fast and will get you places quicker than your feet can			0
but @entity208 , for one , will be keeping my feet on solid ground			0
from £ 429 , theairwheel.com			1

the @entity23 costs £ 429 and can travel for 24 miles on a single charge
the device weighs approximately 13 kgs - similar to a fold - up bicycle
the company behind the device claim a user can be proficient in two days
