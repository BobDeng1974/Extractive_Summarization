next year ’s @entity0 may mark the end of @entity4 ’s @entity3 career after unconfirmed reports in @entity6 suggested that the hooker is poised to join @entity8 next season			1
the 28 - year - old is the most - capped player in the national squad at present , having made 58 @entity13 appearances since his debut against the @entity15 at @entity16 six years ago			1
he has been @entity17 captain since 2009 and during that period the @entity18 have won the @entity20 title , finished as runners - up , reached a @entity22 and won both the @entity23 and @entity24			0
@entity4 is tackled by @entity25 and @entity26 ( right ) at @entity16 last saturday @entity3 21 - 24 @entity27 highlights @entity4 ’s career has been punctuated by disciplinary issues , but his club have supported him , not least when he incurred an 11 - week ban which ruled him out of last year ’s @entity33 tour after being sent off and found guilty of swearing at referee @entity34 in the 2013 @entity35			2
in return , he has been an inspirational talisman for @entity17 and a cult hero at @entity38			0
however , his contract is up at the end of this season and reports across the @entity43 has visited @entity8 to view the facilities and will join the club on a three - year deal after the @entity0			1
there has been no official confirmation from @entity8 or @entity4 ’s advisers , but if he does make that overseas move , it will bring an end to his @entity13 career			2
@entity3 hooker @entity4 , who was born in @entity54 , has been skipper of @entity18 since 2009 @entity4 tackles @entity55 ( left ) during @entity3 's clash with @entity57 at @entity16 in march 2013 the @entity58 and @entity3 management are continuing to enforce a policy of not selecting players based abroad and just last week , national coach @entity62 reiterated his commitment to that stance – aimed at stopping an exodus of @entity67 talent to wealthy @entity6 clubs			1
@entity4 would be 33 by the time of the @entity70 , so he may have concluded that next year ’s home tournament would be a fitting finale at international level			1
for @entity17 , the loss of their skipper would be a major blow as they seek to consolidate their status as @entity67 champions and @entity81 challengers			0
@entity4 may not be the only @entity82 on his way out at the end of the season			2
further @entity6 reports claim that @entity88 no 8 @entity87 has agreed to join @entity89 , while @entity91 centre @entity90 has been linked with a move to @entity93			2
@entity4 ( centre ) packs down for a session on the scrum machine with @entity97 ( left ) and @entity98 for @entity3 , it would be a significant setback to no longer have the services of a pack stalwart , especially as the stocks of test - class options at hooker are not vast			1
@entity106 of @entity107 has been stalked by injuries since making his breakthrough into the national ranks , as has @entity112 ’s @entity111			0
@entity114 no 2 @entity113 is the next man in line at present , while @entity117 ’ @entity116 was in the squad for the summer tour of @entity54			0
but looking ahead to the @entity123 period , @entity120 of @entity121 is seen as the rising force in that position			0
if @entity126 is to lose @entity4 soon , he will hope to see the rookie chief making strong strides towards international honours .			0
