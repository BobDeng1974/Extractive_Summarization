by @entity0 a part - time model who had a £ 4,800 breast enlargement at taxpayers ' expense has said she now wants the implants removed , and is expecting the @entity6 to foot the bill once more			1
@entity8 , 23 , has said rather than improving her life her breast enhancement surgery has left her feeling self - conscious and has led to bullying , so she wants them removed			1
the aspiring model hit the headlines earlier this year when she had her breasts increased from a @entity16 to @entity17 on the @entity6 as she said she was being bullied for her smaller cleavage			1
pictured left , @entity8 before the enhancement and , right , after despite appearing in numerous publications to show off her new bustier look , the mother - of - two is now claiming that her new curves are preventing her from finding work			2
speaking to closer magazine @entity8 , from @entity32 , says : ‘ they ’re so big i find them embarrassing and i do n’t feel i can do any modelling because they ’ve attracted so much negative attention			1
. i ’m thinking about having a reduction on the @entity6			2
‘ i ’m looking into charities that could help , but i think it ’s down to the @entity6 because they made them so big , ’ she argues			1
not totally oblivious to the plight of many who wait months on @entity6 waiting lists due to lack of budgets , @entity8 says of her use of taxpayer money : ’ i feel awful when i hear about people in need who are refused treatment , but i do n’t decide who the @entity6 helps			1
’ ' there ’s a queue and we ’re all in it together			0
if it was my child that was ill i ’d move heaven and earth , like any parent , but i do n’t make the rules			0
' the case caused outrage last month after it was revealed the @entity6 had funded @entity8 's operation while just a few miles away two - year - old @entity66 , who suffers from cerebral palsy , had been turned down for funding for an operation which could allow him to walk			1
at the time his mother @entity71 said : ' @entity66 has splints on his legs , a flexi - stand as he has n’t got any balance , and uses a walking frame to get around			0
@entity8 has previously flaunted her new breasts and even used this outfit to offer a tribute to the @entity6 for paying for her implants @entity8 's two hour operation was performed after a seven month wait , and took her from a @entity16 to a @entity17 cup ' he wants to be jumping in muddy puddles like @entity86			1
he wants to be kicking a football and he ca n’t jump on a trampoline			0
i ’d love to see him walking unaided for his first day at primary school			0
' i ’m a single parent and i do n’t have that kind of money			0
even if they look again at the decision , there ’s going to be a big backlog of children like @entity66 waiting to have this done			0
' the full interview is available in this weeks closer after the story appeared in the @entity101 a deluge of support from readers contributed to the £ 24,000 raised in just one day on a fundraising web page set up for @entity66			0
following the operation , hoping her new bust line would help her dream career as a glamour model , @entity8 went to the media with her story , but found herself at the receiving end of abuse			1
she claims she was taunted trough social media and even shouted at down the street with people demanding their money back			0
‘ i do n’t want to spend my life known as the girl with the massive @entity6 boobs , so having smaller implants is the only option , ’ she says			2
@entity8 was granted the initial breast surgery as she had a congenial medical condition which meant she had no breast tissue			1
the part - time retail assistant was bullied from the age of 16 for her flat chest and said her breast did n’t even grow during her two pregnancies			2
placed on a waiting list in 2012 , @entity8 had the two - hour operation seven months later at @entity133 in @entity32			2
she said : ' people do n't understand that i deserved the surgery			0
' i was born without breast tissue			1
i 'm as worthy as anyone else			0
and i thought working as a model would be a good way of paying back into the system through tax			0
' however , she now hopes to re-join a waiting list for surgery to have the implants removed			1
unsurprisingly her story has caused upset , particularly as a drive to cut an additional £ 20 billion from the @entity6 budget has recently been announced			2
chief executive of the tax payers alliance @entity152 says : ‘ it is ridiculous that taxpayers paid for this surgery in the first place			0
