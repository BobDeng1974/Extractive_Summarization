a pair of young female lovers writhing in pleasure as they embrace			0
a married , older couple entwined in each others arms			0
a courtesan , her neck exposed , the flash of crimson at her collar hinting at pleasures to come			0
this is @entity12 or ' spring pictures ' , an astonishingly explicit genre of @entity16 art that is the subject of a new exhibition at the @entity18			1
but though it sounds like pornography at first hearing , the reality of shunga is far from crude modern depictions of sex			2
erotic : a pair of lovers embrace in a scene from @entity30 's @entity29 , circa 1788 most of the images , although explicit , are loving - even tender - and show the pleasure being shared out between men and women in equal measure			0
nevertheless , it certainly does n't pull any punches			0
so frank are the 170 artworks on display , the museum has insisted on a no unaccompanied under - 16 's rule			2
there are young people and old , gay and straight couplings , clothed and unclothed , and images that hint at sex , while others offer a ringside seat			0
many focus on middle - class married couples with their stories delicately inked in alongside as well as exhortations to go faster or slow down from the ladies pictured			0
courtesan : a ' sexual dalliance ' with a geisha portrayed by @entity59 circa 1711 - 1716 lovers : two women embrace in one of the erotic shunga scenes that will go on display at the @entity18 particularly stunning is @entity67 's @entity66 no maki ( @entity69 for the sleeve ) , where the finely drawn scene offers an intimate glimpse into the bedroom of an ageing couple , her hair elaborately drawn up with gold pins , his receding rapidly			1
but not everything is so familiar			0
@entity80 's @entity79 , shows a dreaming woman wrapped in the erotic embrace of an octopus			1
and while most shunga do focus on ordinary @entity16 people , the odd @entity85 or @entity86 adventurer sometimes creeps in			1
although most of the works on display at the @entity18 date from between 1600 and 1900 , shunga 's roots go back much further and to @entity94			1
mature : an older couple star in @entity67 's @entity96 no maki ( @entity69 for the sleeve ) , circa 1785 sexuality : @entity30 explores female pleasure in @entity101 no so ( left ) and a young woman enjoying a daydream among the first artists to create what would become known as shunga was @entity108 erotic painter , @entity107 , whose paintings , created between 730 to 800 ad , depicted courtiers in various states of undress and with unusually large genitalia			1
in @entity16 itself , the earliest works can be traced to the contemporary @entity117 period , although it did n't become widely popular until much later			1
by 1600 , shunga was being produced by the @entity120 ( ‘ pictures of the floating world ’ ) , which included some of the greatest @entity16 masters including @entity125 , @entity30 and @entity80			1
despite widespread acceptance , shunga was banned by the @entity16 government in 1722 , although censorship barely dented in its popularity			1
@entity12 finally fell out of favour in the late 19th and early 20th century , when the advent of erotic photography left it unable to compete			2
now , with porn and boob - heavy lad 's mags everywhere you look , shunga appears an oddly gentle way of portraying sex and love - octopuses notwithstanding			0
shunga : sex and pleasure in @entity145 runs from 3rd october until 5th january 2014 at the @entity18			2
see britishmuseum.org for more information .			0
