by @entity0 , political correspondent published : 19:03 est , 8 october 2013 updated : 04:42 est , 9 october 2013 warning : pensions minister @entity1 said encouraging early retirement to give youngsters jobs is counter-productive routinely pensioning off older workers to make way for unemployed youngsters would hurt the economy , a minister claimed yesterday			1
employees in their sixties tended to be more experienced , more productive and took less time off sick than younger staff , said pensions minister @entity1			1
ushering them into retirement early would be a mistake because jobless youngsters can not simply ‘ slot in ’ to their vacant posts			0
‘ this is not the battle of generations , ’ he said during a debate in @entity21 yesterday			0
the @entity25 was answering a question from @entity28 mp @entity27 , who said that keeping people working for longer meant youngsters could not get a job			1
but mr @entity1 said youngsters with no work experience were no substitute for mature employees who still had plenty to offer @entity38 ’s workforce			1
‘ older workers on average are very productive , ’ he said			1
‘ if you pension off older workers early , the economy as a whole suffers			1
’ he added : ‘ often older workers are more experienced and highly productive			1
they take less time off sick			0
’ previous efforts to reduce youth unemployment by retiring workers early have had no major impact , claimed mr @entity1			1
early in 1977 , the @entity51 government introduced a ‘ work release scheme ’ to encourage those aged 59 to retire			0
the measure was then extended to men over 60 in 1983 by a @entity57 government with the aim of taking tens of thousands off the dole queue , but the move made no difference to the figures , said mr @entity1			1
‘ all it did was stick lots of men in their early 60s on benefit , ’ he said			0
‘ it did nothing for youth unemployment			0
’ mr @entity1 said studies showed there is ‘ no evidence that the younger workforce benefits if you pension off older workers ’			1
he cited a study by the respected @entity77 , which showed that there was ‘ no evidence of long - term crowding - out of younger individuals ’ by the over- 50s			0
experienced : mr @entity1 cited a study which said older workers were better at complicated tasks surveys by charities show that older workers often face discrimination by employers who fear they will be slower and take more time off to recover from illness			1
but a study for the charity @entity91 by the @entity92 revealed that older workers showed ‘ little sign of a decline in overall productivity because older workers compensated with skills and experience ’			1
the report concluded that ‘ while bottom line speed may deteriorate , overall efficacy offsets any impact to productivity ’			0
‘ younger people might be typically faster at carrying out repetitive tasks [ but ] , in comparison older people are often faster at carrying out complex tasks that allow them to draw on their contextual knowledge and years of work experience , ’ the research concluded			2
a separate study of @entity113 workers at a @entity115 car plant found that older workers were more productive and less prone to errors than their younger counterparts			2
car maker @entity118 also set up a production line staffed only by older employees and found productivity went up 7 per cent in the first year			2
the study also found that older people took fewer short - term absences			2
but when they were absent on sick leave , it was for longer			0
similarly , older people were found to have fewer but more serious accidents at work			0
researchers discovered that mature staff were motivated and as willing to work as flexibly as younger workers			2
@entity133 , a former adviser to the @entity134 , said : ‘ keeping people in the workforce for as long as possible is good for the economy			0
‘ once an older person loses their job , it can be nearly impossible for them to find a new one			0
‘ yet all the evidence shows that older people are more productive , more loyal and have more useful experience in the workforce than younger people			0
’ she said ministers should do more to encourage older workers to stay on – at least in part - time roles – and even to retrain if necessary .			2

@entity25 @entity1 *defended* the role of more experienced staff
he said there would be no advantage to forcing older workers out to make room for the young
