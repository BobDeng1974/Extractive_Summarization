@entity0 has broken his silence on the racism row involving @entity3 and his brother @entity4 , branding the former @entity6 captain the ‘ biggest idiot ’ and accusing both @entity3 and @entity7 of ‘ betrayal ’			1
in an explosive new autobiography , @entity0 reflects on the drama that was sparked by events at @entity13 on october 23 , 2011 , when @entity3 branded his younger brother a ‘ f * * * ing black c * * * ’			1
while @entity3 was acquitted in a criminal trial , an independent @entity18 tribunal found the @entity21 skipper guilty of racially abusing @entity22 and punished him with a four - match ban and a fine of £ 220,000			1
@entity0 ( left ) branded former @entity6 team - mate @entity3 ( right ) ' the biggest idiot ' in his new book the @entity18 ruled that @entity22 ( left ) was called a ' f * * * * * * black c * * * ' by @entity3 ( centre ) in october 2011 they started together 50 times for @entity6 , they were great friends and @entity0 was among the guests for @entity7 ’s stag party			1
but when @entity7 agreed to give evidence that supported @entity3 at his race trial , @entity0 accused him of ‘ betrayal ’			1
in a furious text exchange - an abridged version is repeated below - @entity0 told @entity7 that their friendship would be over			1
@entity0 later called @entity7 a ‘ fake ’ on @entity40			2
he had previously retweeted a comment that @entity7 was a ‘ choc - ice ’			2
the term usually implies someone is being black on the outside and white on the inside , although @entity0 denied this and was cleared of a racist comment			0
he was , however , found guilty of improper conduct by the @entity18 , who said : ‘ the commission found that the breach included a reference to ethnic origin , colour or race			0
’ @entity0 : ‘ either tell the court exactly what happened , or do n’t go at all			0
’ @entity7 : ‘ i ’ve got no choice			0
i ’ve been told i ’ve got to go			0
’ @entity0 : ‘ know this , we ( my family ) will never talk to you again			2
’ @entity7 : ‘ you think i want to come off my holidays and go through this s * * * ? it ’s what i ’ve been told to do			2
’ @entity0 : ‘ all right , do it			0
’ as @entity0 reveals in his book , # 2sides , being serialised in @entity73 , the whole episode took a huge toll on his family			1
they were racially abused and received death threats in the form of bullets sent through the post , while his mother had to endure having the windows at her home smashed and became so ill because of the stress she had to be admitted to hospital			0
@entity0 writes of a controversy that ‘ damaged football and race relations in @entity91 ’ and for the most part he blames a player he stood alongside in central defence ‘ 30 or 40 ’ times for @entity6			2
in the same memoirs , @entity0 reveals he would have agreed to continue to play alongside @entity3 in the @entity6 team had manager @entity96 taken the time to ask him			1
@entity0 said @entity3 was ‘ the biggest idiot ’ who ‘ could have saved everyone a lot of pain by admitting immediately that he has used the words in the heat of the moment ’			1
after choosing not to appeal against the @entity18 punishment , @entity3 did issue a public apology for the language he used			2
what he has never done , @entity0 claims , is have the decency to apologise to @entity22 or his family			2
@entity0 , @entity7 and @entity3 were all teammates for @entity6 for a number of years @entity3 ( right ) could have resolved the issue by ringing the @entity0 family after the incident , says @entity117 had @entity3 apologised at the time and insisted he was ‘ no racist ’ , @entity0 says he and his brother would have let the matter rest			1
‘ i ’d have told him : “ i think you ’re a p * * * k for saying it , but you ’ve actually come and manned up ”			0
’ but he now says he will no longer speak to someone he once considered a friend , insisting : ‘ i find it impossible to forgive or forget the pain he put my family through			0
‘ he just sat there and watched as my brother went through all that because of his stupidity			0
he tried to run away from what he had done			0
’ @entity0 remains resentful of the way the situation was handled by @entity96 when he succeeded @entity138 as @entity6 manager shortly before the 2012 euros			1
but his book underlines how fractured a once superb @entity6 defence became because of the @entity3 race storm			2
@entity96 should have taken @entity0 to @entity143 and @entity144 – certainly ahead of @entity145 , who was called up as a replacement for the injured @entity148 – but the friction between @entity0 , @entity3 and @entity7 could have become a problem			1
@entity3 quit @entity6 after @entity18 ’s charge , despite being cleared in @entity152 of racial abuse @entity22 ( right ) leaves @entity154 after the @entity3 racism case in july 2012 at the time @entity96 insisted @entity0 was omitted from the squad for ‘ footballing reasons ’ , but the promotion of @entity145 – a @entity160 player who had made just 10 @entity162 appearances – brought fresh focus on that particular statement			1
@entity0 questioned the @entity6 manager with a tweet , stating : ‘ what reasons ? ? ? ? ? ? ! ! ! ’ @entity0 reflects now with some frustration on @entity96 ’s failure to engage with him over @entity3 , suggesting the actions of a colleague brought an abrupt and premature end to an international career that should have reached 100 rather than 81 caps			1
‘ my @entity6 career was wrecked , ’ said @entity0			2
had @entity96 asked him about @entity3 , @entity0 would have told him he was still ‘ happy to play for @entity6 alongside him ’			1
he said he would have acted professionally , recognising @entity3 as a player who could help his team - mates win			2
and he would have been right			0
at @entity178 , @entity3 was outstanding			0
@entity0 wishes he had been able to reach 100 caps for @entity6 rather than the 81 he achieved @entity0 says @entity180 ( pictured ) had asked him he would have played with @entity3 for @entity6 ‘ but no one ever asked ( if he would still play with @entity183 ) , ’ complained @entity0 in his book			1
‘ i found that pretty extraordinary because i ’d let it be known			0
@entity96 should have at least asked			0
but that conversation never took place ! ’ @entity0 feels he ‘ should have had 100 caps ’			0
as it was , his last @entity6 appearance was against @entity190 in june 2011			2
he officially retired from international football in may 2013			0
it appears to be with some sadness that the @entity3 race row destroyed his friendship with @entity7			1
but @entity0 was distressed to discover that @entity7 planned to give evidence on @entity3 ’s behalf in the criminal trial at @entity198 in july 2012			1
it sparked an extraordinary exchange between the two players , with @entity0 accusing @entity7 of an act of ‘ betrayal ’			2
the two , @entity0 recalls , had been friends since childhood and he was staggered to discover from @entity4 that @entity7 planned to appear in court for his club - mate @entity3			1
@entity7 and @entity0 fell out during the court case between @entity3 and @entity22 @entity0 ( pictured ) has revealed how the @entity3 race row affected his family in his book , # 2sides while he acknowledges the pressure @entity7 must have been under , @entity0 feels the then @entity21 full - back should have asked @entity3 to leave him ‘ out of it ’ because of the impact it could have on his relationship with @entity117 and @entity4			1
he also said he would have accepted @entity7 ’s verdict had he contacted him to say @entity3 was innocent			2
as it was , he did not hear from @entity7 either			0
so he telephoned him and to his astonishment @entity7 rebuked him for making the call			0
‘ i said , “ @entity221 , what are you doing ? my little brother ’s going through hell			0
i ’m out of order ringing you ? what world are you living in ” ? ’ @entity3 was acquitted but the @entity18 , as @entity0 points out , were extremely critical of @entity7 in their 63 - page judgement report , stating that his evidence had ‘ evolved ’ over time to assist @entity3			1
@entity0 ’s last contact with @entity7 came via a text exchange just before @entity3 ’s trial			1
he implored @entity7 to ‘ tell the exact truth ’ or not to go at all			0
@entity7 meekly replied that he had no choice but to go			0
@entity0 warned @entity7 that his appearance in court for @entity3 would mark the end of their friendship			1
@entity7 arrives to attend the trial of his team - mate @entity3 at @entity154 court @entity7 ( second right ) was asked to defend @entity3 ( centre ) in court during the criminal investigation in court @entity7 agreed he was a reluctant witness , admitting he was a ‘ close friend ’ while acknowledging he has known the @entity0 family ‘ for a long time ’			1
but in his role as a defence witness he also argued : ‘ i think we should n’t be sitting here			0
’ in the new book , @entity0 is also critical of @entity21 for the approach they took			1
in fairness to the current @entity162 leaders , they took disciplinary action against their captain on conclusion of the @entity18 hearing			0
that , however , did not satisfy @entity0			0
‘ at the time @entity21 seemed to have no thought beyond wanting to keep their captain in action , ’ said @entity0 , who no doubt noted that the @entity18 judgement also criticised the conduct of @entity21 club secretary @entity266			1
the independent @entity18 commission said it had ‘ very real concerns about mr @entity266 ’s recollections ’			0
@entity0 feels @entity21 fans failed to realise it was not his brother who reported @entity3 to the police but a member of the public			1
he also felt it important to stress that it was @entity21 ’s lawyers who summoned @entity22 to court			0
further to that , he remains frustrated by the @entity18 ’s decision to delay their own disciplinary hearing until after @entity3 ’s criminal trial			2
‘ they passed the buck for almost a year , ’ he said			0

@entity0 's family went through torrid ordeal after @entity21 captain used racially - *aggravated* language against his brother @entity4 in october 2011
@entity310 defender reveals he would have continued to play for @entity6 alongside @entity3 if @entity6 boss @entity96 had given him a call
@entity3 did not receive any criminal charge but *suspended* by @entity18
