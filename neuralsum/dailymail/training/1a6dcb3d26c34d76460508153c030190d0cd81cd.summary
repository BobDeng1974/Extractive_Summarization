by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity3 team principal @entity2 launched an astonishing tirade against the @entity6 media on friday as he attempted to defend @entity8 's forthcoming inclusion on the calendar			1
@entity2 , along with his counterparts in @entity12 's @entity11 , @entity14 's @entity13 , @entity15 from @entity16 , @entity18 's @entity17 and @entity19 from @entity19 , faced several tricky questions during the @entity23 team principals ' press conference			1
when the focus switched towards why @entity6 ventures into areas that are suspect given the human rights record of certain countries , including @entity8 , @entity2 turned on his inquisitor , and the @entity6 press in general			1
attack : @entity2 ( centre ) launched an astonishing tirade against @entity6 media on friday ' this is becoming a very depressing press conference where we 're focused on the negativities , ' said an exasperated @entity2			1
' look , there is a calendar that comes out in october and november and we all have a choice whether we enter the world championship or not			2
' all the people sitting here are racers and they are here because they are passionate about the sport and want to compete			0
' when we sign up for that championship we put our faith and trust in the promoter and the @entity23 , and we will attend those races unless they deem it unnecessary for us to be there			0
' all of you , or the vast majority , will be at those races , and why ? because you are either passionate about the sport or because you earn a living out of covering the sport			0
on track : @entity61 in action during saturday morning 's final practice session ahead of qualifying ' it is wrong to make @entity6 a political subject			1
we are a sport , we should be talking about the drivers in these conferences , about the spectacular racing between our drivers and his driver ( pointing to @entity11 ) at the last grand prix ( in @entity76 )			0
' we should be talking about what a great race it was for @entity61 to come through the grid			0
' yet all we do is focus on the negatives , and it has to be said , it gets pretty boring for us to sit up here and fend off these questions			2
' how about asking some questions about what 's going to happen in the race on sunday , about what 's going to happen in qualifying tomorrow			0
' if you 've got these ( other ) questions then please point them at @entity96 ( @entity95 ) @entity94 ( @entity23 president ) or @entity96 ( @entity99 ) @entity98 rather than the teams			0
' @entity8 joins the calendar in 2016 and has been given the name of @entity6 of @entity103 as @entity6 further expands its reach into the eastern part of the continent given @entity107 debuts later this year			1
with @entity109 due to return next season after what will be a 23 - year absence , the team principals were in agreement the new races were a positive for the sport .			2

@entity3 team principal lost his cool when asked about the inclusion of @entity8 on the @entity6 calendar
he took swipe at ' boring ' and ' depressing ' media in heated rant
added that it is ' wrong to make @entity6 a political subject '
