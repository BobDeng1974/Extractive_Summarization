@entity1 took pole position for the @entity4 @entity3 with a lap so quick and so emphatic that it set the @entity7 alight			1
after inflicting the misery of @entity9 on his @entity11 team - mate @entity10 a fortnight ago , @entity1 finished 0.079sec ahead here			1
there was no possible deception in this performance			0
the simpler , faster configuration of this circuit next to the @entity18 rowing lake was meant to be more to @entity10 ’s liking than @entity9 ’s tight streets ( though he is hardly sluggish there either )			1
he set the fastest times in the first two sessions of qualifying , but then @entity1 struck			1
@entity10 pushed hard but simply had not got the pace he needed			1
in contrast to @entity9 , @entity10 was cordial afterwards			1
he was hardly smiling , quite reasonably , but put his arm around @entity1 in the pictures afterwards			2
@entity1 said : ‘ i know it is a track where @entity10 is traditionally very quick and i am happy it has worked out			1
all weekend i have progressed well			0
‘ i have been looking at data , working with my engineers , seeing where i can do better			0
having won the last race brought me some momentum			0
’ out in front : @entity1 secured pole position for the @entity4 @entity3 in @entity30 @entity50 : @entity10 was 0.079 slower than his @entity52 team - mate and will start in second place clenched fist : @entity1 punches the air @entity10 said : ‘ @entity1 did a fantastic job today			1
sometimes sessions do n’t work out			0
i think it will be a close battle tomorrow			0
@entity60 will be very difficult seeing as @entity1 is in the same car as mine and is so close in pace			2
’ nobody was likely to challenge @entity11 for pole , though @entity65 held the fastest time during the second session before @entity10 and @entity1 blitzed their way to the front			1
@entity71 ’s world champion @entity70 finally came third – an upturn in his fortunes			1
@entity74 of @entity76 ninth , ahead of his team - mate @entity77 in 12th			1
further down the grid , @entity78 caused a red flag to be waved when he crashed his @entity81 towards the end of the first session			0
the @entity84 was not even on a fast lap at the time			0
@entity10 , though he says it will be hard to overtake , has great history at this track			2
he won here in 2010 and 2012 , building on his success in 2007 , his first ever @entity92 victory			0
it was a markedly different @entity10 back then			2
he was 22 , his father held his umbrella on the grid , he earned a ‘ mere ’ £ 500,000 , lived in @entity97 and barely counted a rapper among his friends			0
but even in those intoxicating days of his nascent career , there were early signs of the controversy that has stalked his career intermittently since			0
close behind : @entity70 will lead the chasing pack as he starts from third place flying high : @entity107 qualified fourth ahead of his @entity110 team - mate @entity65 then , as now , the preceding race in @entity9 was contentious			1
@entity10 had stated that he was not a ‘ @entity114 ’ , implying that @entity76 gave his team - mate @entity112 the better strategy			1
he put that aside to take pole here and held his nerve through four safety car phases , including the one prompted by his karting friend @entity119 ’s somersaulting accident , to win			0
it will take a similar clearness of thought to prevail here again today			0
@entity30 is one of @entity92 ’s minor jewels , conforming to the aphorism that all the sport ’s best venues start with an ‘ m ’			2
@entity130 , @entity9 , @entity131 are the others			0
@entity30 has won its accolade by providing gripping races and turning its central streets into a carnival city for the weekend			2
trailing : @entity137 's @entity112 could only manage a disappointing seventh place @entity140 pack : @entity76 driver @entity74 finished in ninth place in @entity30 so we should celebrate that the city has agreed a 10 - year extension to host the race			1
the estimated £ 100million they will pay @entity147 for the privilege is less than most venues , a sign of its value to the sport			0
organisers will spend £ 20million on improving the paddock , which wears a faded 1970s look			0
speaking of the @entity157 , if @entity10 manages to overhaul @entity1 on sunday he will equal the 27 career wins of sir @entity160			1
the @entity161 reached his total in 99 races ; @entity10 will have done so in 136			2
@entity74 is not writing off his former team - mate			1
‘ this are two tracks where @entity10 is pretty much unbeatable – @entity167 and here , ’ he said			2
@entity1 is warned , but on saturday night he was right to be smiling broadly .			0
