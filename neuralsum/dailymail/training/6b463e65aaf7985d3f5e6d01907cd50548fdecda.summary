by @entity0 published : 05:32 est , 5 november 2013 updated : 10:26 est , 5 november 2013 a husband has saved his bride ’s life by giving her one of his kidneys - after she discovered she needed a transplant on the eve of their wedding			1
@entity9 , from @entity10 , faced years of gruelling dialysis , as her life hung in the balance while she waited for a kidney donor			1
but her husband , @entity15 , 31 , offered to donate his own kidney , and the pair underwent the lifesaving surgery together			1
@entity9 was told she needed a kidney transplant the day before her wedding to @entity15			1
when no deceased donor could be found , mr @entity21 offered his wife one of his kidneys mrs @entity9 said : ‘ i do n’t know how i ’ll ever repay @entity15 for what he ’s done for me			1
‘ he ’s the most generous person i know and i could not have asked for a better gift			0
‘ he ’s changed , and saved , my life - he ’s one in a million			0
’ mrs @entity9 was diagnosed with a kidney condition known as reflux nephropathy when she was a child			1
the condition means the tubes from her kidneys to her bladder are positioned wrongly so they allow urine to flow back up from the bladder to the kidneys			1
after receiving her first kidney transplant at the age of 17 the music teacher had hoped she could put her health problems behind her			1
but on the day before her wedding in 2011 , she was told that her donated kidney was beginning to fail			1
mrs @entity9 said : ‘ i had a hospital appointment the day before i married @entity15 and i was more or less told that i would need a new kidney			1
mrs @entity9 received a new kidney from her husband last month and the couple are now recovering at home			1
mrs @entity9 said : ' i ca n't begin to describe what an incredible thing @entity15 has done for me ' ‘ i knew the donated kidney would n’t last forever but it was still such a shock			1
‘ i was preparing for the best day of my life and to receive such horrible news was devastating			0
’ after the wedding , mrs @entity9 began to deteriorate quickly , and soon the newlywed was put onto dialysis whilst she waited for a donor			1
she said : ‘ going on dialysis was very difficult - i was a young woman , newly married , but i had to spend every night hooked up to a machine , it was horrible			2
‘ while i was on dialysis we ’d been given some information about organ donation , and it mentioned living donors - @entity15 offered himself up straight away			1
’ although the waiting time for a deceased donor was three to four years , the wait for a living donor was just six months			2
mr @entity21 said : ‘ as soon as i realised i could give @entity9 my kidney , i volunteered			2
‘ i did n’t give it a second thought - she ’s my wife , and if i was able to help her , then i was going to do it			0
mrs @entity9 has reflux nephropathy which means the tubes to her bladder are positioned wrongly - they allow urine to flow back from her bladder to her kidneys ‘ they tested @entity9 ’s closest family members first , as they prefer a genetic match , but her mum was n’t a match , her younger sister is too young , and her older brother is all the way in @entity90			1
‘ her @entity91 was a match , but as i ’m younger and fitter , we all decided it would be better for me to go ahead with the donation			0
’ while mr @entity21 was more than prepared to give his wife his kidney , mrs @entity9 was more worried			2
she said : ‘ i was reluctant to let him at first			0
‘ i love my husband very much but i worried about the future and what would happen if we ever split up			0
‘ i did n’t want to put him through unnecessary surgery either			2
‘ it took me a while to come to terms with it			0
’ reflux nephropathy is a kidney disease in which urine passes back up from the bladder towards the kidneys instead of leaving the body			1
nearly all cases of the disease result from an abnormality that develops before birth			0
the abnormality means one or both of the drainage tubes from the kidneys to the bladder enter the bladder at the wrong angle			2
as a result , when the bladder contracts to pass urine outwards , the tubes are not pinched off meaning some urine goes back up towards the kidneys			1
the most common symptom of reflux nephropathy is frequent urine infections			1
about one in 100 children have some degree of reflux of urine but in nine out of 10 cases it causes no problems and disappears on its own during childhood			2
however , in rare cases , the condition can cause kidney damage which can eventually lead to kidney failure and the need for dialysis or transplant			1
source : @entity149 mr @entity21 , a solicitor , was at work when he received a call from the transplant coordinator to tell him they could do the transplant three days later , in october this year			0
he said : ‘ i had just been chatting to my boss at work about the transplant when i got the call			0
‘ i was telling him that the odds of having the operation soon were pretty low - but then i took a call and was told it was going to happen in the next few days			2
‘ i could n’t believe it			0
’ mrs @entity9 added : ‘ after we got the call it was all a bit of a blur			2
‘ we went straight into hospital and @entity15 had two days worth of tests to make sure he was healthy enough to go ahead			2
‘ then the day came for the surgery			0
he went down three hours before me , which was pretty scary			0
‘ that ’s when the enormity of it all dawned on me really - i was very tearful but i knew he was in good hands			0
‘ then i went into the anaesthetist ’s room - there was just enough time for them to tell me that @entity15 ’s surgery had gone well and there was a healthy kidney for me , before i was out of it			1
‘ the next thing i knew , i was wheeled back up to the ward and @entity15 was waiting for me			2
’ three days after the surgery mr @entity21 left hospital , closely followed by his wife just two days later			0
the pair are now recovering well at home			0
he said : ‘ this operation has changed our lives			0
‘ before , @entity9 was ill all the time , and she was always tired and unwell			0
‘ now it ’s like she ’s got a new lease of life			0
‘ she ’s my wife and i love her very much - to know that she ’s healthy now and i ’ll have her with me for a long time to come , is just amazing			0
’ mrs @entity9 said : ‘ i ca n’t begin to describe what an incredible thing @entity15 has done for me			1
‘ he ’s given me my life back - and my parents think he ’s the best son in law ever ! ’			0
