by @entity0 scientists found eating a one ounce serving of nuts two or more times a week lowered the risk of a tumour by 35 per cent eating a handful of nuts just twice a week could slash the risk of developing one of the most lethal forms of cancer			1
new research shows snacking on one ounce of nuts two or more time a week can reduce the chances of pancreatic cancer by more than a third			1
the study , carried out at @entity19 in @entity20 , @entity21 , did not differentiate between different types of edible nuts - suggesting having them as a regular snack is more important than eating one type over another			2
the findings , published online in the @entity29 , offer some hope in the prevention of a disease which has a high mortality rate			0
every year , around 8,000 people in the @entity35 are diagnosed with cancer of the pancreas , a pear - shaped organ about six inches long that lies deep inside the body between the stomach and the spine			1
its job is to produce enzymes that help to break down food and release insulin to control blood sugar levels			0
the cause remains largely unknown , although smokers may have a slightly higher risk , as do those who have suffered chronic pancreatitis - a persistent infection often brought on by gall stones , or frequent binge drinking			0
some studies suggest having diabetes is also a risk factor			0
many sufferers only discover a problem when they experience considerable and unexpected weight loss , caused by the cancer eating away at their digestive system			2
the study did not differentiate between different types of edible nuts - suggesting having them as a regular snack is more important than eating one type over another it is widely regarded as one of the most lethal of all tumours , killing around 97 per cent of its victims within five years			2
many only live a matter of months			0
although previous studies have suggested nuts may have anti-cancer properties when eaten as part of a healthy diet , the evidence remains inconclusive			0
the @entity19 team wanted to investigate whether eating them had any effect specifically on the incidence of pancreatic cancer			1
scientists at @entity90 ( pictured ) found one ounce of nuts two or more time a week can reduce the chances of pancreatic cancer by more than a third they used data from the @entity96 , a long - running investigation into all aspects of health among thousands of female nurses in the @entity21			1
the researchers took a sample of more than 75,000 women and studied the incidence of pancreatic cancer			1
they then looked at nut consumption among the cancer victims , compared to healthy volunteers who did not have the disease			0
the results showed that eating a one ounce serving of nuts two or more times a week lowered the risk of a tumour by 35 per cent compared to women who rarely or never ate them			1
even when researchers allowed for other factors that might have increased the risks - such as whether they were overweight or had a history of diabetes - they found nuts still had a significant benefit			0
in a report on their findings the researchers said : ' frequent nut consumption is inversely associated with the risk of pancreatic cancer , independent of other potential risk factors for the disease			2
