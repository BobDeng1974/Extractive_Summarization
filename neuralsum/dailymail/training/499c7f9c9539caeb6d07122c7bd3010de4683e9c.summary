a group of @entity2 hunters says it has identified 76 men and four women - many of whom may still be alive - who ran mobile death squads killing thousands of @entity7 during the 1930s and 40s			1
the @entity9 claims to have identified dozens of former members of the @entity2 death squads , and says it is now pushing the @entity13 government for a formal investigation			1
the centre 's top @entity2 hunter , @entity15 , said that his research is so solid that he last month sent the @entity13 justice and interior ministries a list of 76 men and four women he has identified as having served in the so - called @entity23 , adding that he is demanding those still living face charges			1
victims : the @entity23 are known to have rounded up and shot @entity7 in the opening salvo of the @entity28 before the @entity2 concentration camp system was properly established the @entity23 - made up of primarily @entity31 and police personnel - followed @entity2 's troops as they battled their way eastward in the early years of the war			1
they are known to have rounded up and shot @entity7 in the opening salvo of the @entity28 before the @entity2 concentration camp system was properly established			1
according to the @entity35 , the @entity23 had killed more than a million @entity7 , as well as tens of thousands of other people , by the spring of 1943			1
' in the death camps the actual act of murder was carried out by a very small number of people - the people who put the gas into the gas chambers			0
but the actual act of murder in the @entity23 was carried out individually , ' @entity15 said			1
find : the @entity9 's top @entity2 hunter , @entity15 ( pictured ) , said he is now pushing the @entity13 government for a formal investigation ' almost every person in the @entity23 was a murderer , a hands - on murderer , ' he added			1
@entity15 said he narrowed down the list of possible suspects by choosing the youngest from a list of some 1,100 with dates of birth known to his organization			2
it is estimated that there had been about 3,000 members of the death squads			0
all 80 of those on his list would now be elderly if still alive , born between 1920 and 1924 , @entity15 said			2
' @entity64 is running out , ' he said in a telephone interview from @entity66			0
' something has to be done			0
' because of @entity2 's strict privacy laws , the @entity9 has been unable to confirm exactly where the suspects live			2
but @entity15 said that task , and determining whether the individuals are still alive , should be relatively easy for police or prosecutors			2
he added that his office is willing to assist in any way in coming up with evidence or other details			0
' the hope is that as many as possible will be alive , but there 's no guarantee obviously , ' he said			0
' but every person alive today is a victory of sorts			0
' the @entity23 - made up of primarily @entity31 and police personnel - followed @entity2 's troops as they battled their way eastward in the early years of the war			2
pictured , @entity31 leader @entity89 inspects @entity2 's @entity90 had no immediate comment but the @entity92 said it had passed the details of the letter to the special federal prosecutors ' office that investigates @entity2 - era crimes			0
the head of that office , @entity98 , told the @entity100 he has n't yet received the new information			0
a handful of @entity23 members were tried and convicted after the war but most have gone unpunished			1
@entity98 has said , however , they could now be prosecuted under new @entity13 legal theory that service in a @entity2 unit whose sole purpose was murder is enough to convict someone of accessory to murder - even without evidence of participation in a specific crime as had previously been required .			0
