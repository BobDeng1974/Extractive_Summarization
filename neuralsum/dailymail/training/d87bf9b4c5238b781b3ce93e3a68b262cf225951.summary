it is a classic @entity1 fight			0
food giant @entity2 has launched a lawsuit against @entity5 firm @entity4 , claiming it is misleading consumers by selling its plant based product , called @entity9 , as mayonnaise			1
@entity4 boss @entity11 told @entity12 the action is ' bullying ' , and believes it could help the firm by drawing publicity to its product			1
@entity4 sells a range of its egless product , called @entity9 , in supermarkets across the @entity21 , and is carried by @entity22 and @entity23 among others			1
@entity4 , based in @entity5 , analyzed thousands of plants to a mix that can replicate mayonnaise			1
its best - known product , @entity9 , is a mayonnaise that uses a type of @entity32 yellow pea as a substitute for eggs			2
the firm also makes a range of flavoured mayonnaise products , and cookie dough , and its products are available at @entity22 , @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity23			2
' this is just bullying , but it could be a very positive thing for us , ' he said			2
' this is just antiquated horse and buggy mindsets , this just is n't applicable - it 's silly			0
the complaint accuses @entity52 creek of false advertising			0
' this is a civil action for false advertising and unfair competition under federal and state law , ' the suit , filed in @entity55 , says			2
' @entity4 sells a sandwich spread named @entity9 in direct competition with @entity2 's @entity61 and @entity63 's brands of mayonnaise			1
' despite its name , @entity9 does not contain just mayonnaise			2
' in fact , it is not mayonnaise at all			0
' rather , it is a plant - based vegan alternative to real mayonnaise			0
' a @entity71 told @entity12 : ' we are a strong supporter of innovation both within and outside our company			0
' our concern here is not about innovation , it is about misleading labelling as it is simply not accurate to label the @entity4 product as ' @entity9 ' or to reinforce the link with images of ingredients , in this case eggs , that are not even used			1
' contrastingly , our @entity88 's brand is made from real eggs that are cage free and deliver great taste from natural sources			1
' we simply wish to defend both consumers from being misled and also our brand			0
' fans of @entity4 have flocked to an online petition created by chef and travel presenter @entity98 , which has attracted over 10,000 signatures			1
' when a 60 billion dollar company flexes its muscles to prevent a good - for - the - world startup company from succeeding , there are only two words for that : corporate bullying , ' he said			0
@entity11 's idea was to find a mix of easy - to - grow plants that , when mixed together in the right way , replicate the taste , nutritional values and cooking properties of an egg			1
@entity4 ceo @entity11 , seen here with @entity119 , said the lawsuit was ' bullying ' this , he believes will allow the firm to produce its substitute for mass market foods - and to allow developing worlds to grow their own versions with added nutrients			1
according to the filing , @entity9 has already harmed sales of ' real ' mayonnaise			0
' @entity4 's literally - false name and its unsubstantiated superiority claims have already caused consumer deception and serious , irreparable harm to @entity2 and to the product category the industry has taken great care to define in a way consistent			1
' @entity11 says he hopes the issue will draw people to the debate over sustainability , and comes as @entity2 embarks on a @entity21 ad campaign to brand itself as a sustainable firm			1
' i 'd be surprised if the ceo knows about it - and that he wo n't contact someone when he hears , ' said @entity11			0
' from a legal perspective , this is why we use mayo - we got lots of legal advice so we feel we are on the right side of this			2
' ' just like @entity156 and airbnb , we are dealing with these issues			0
we think how we feed people is even more important			0
' this whole system needs to be reinvented			0

@entity4 sold in supermarkets across the @entity21
