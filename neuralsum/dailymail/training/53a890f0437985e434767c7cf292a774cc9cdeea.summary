by @entity0 published : 13:22 est , 27 february 2013 updated : 17:44 est , 27 february 2013 at the age of just 20 , @entity1 is a multiple world record holder , double paralympic gold medallist and an mbe thanks to her talent for wheelchair racing			1
but while no - one can doubt her sporting prowess , @entity9 , who has cerebral palsy , said she often meets people who assume she 's stupid because she 's in a wheelchair			1
' some people pat you on head or treat like dog and can be patronising , ' she told the @entity18			1
' but just because your legs do n't work , it does n't mean your brain does n't work			0
golden girl : @entity9 won the @entity23 and 200m at the @entity25 2012 @entity24 ' i can laugh that kind of thing off but for others it can be degrading and upsetting , we just want to be seen as another member of society			1
disabled people can be just as intellectual and clever as anyone else			0
' @entity9 , from @entity36 , said there has been great strides in improving people 's perceptions of those with disabilities thanks to the @entity24			1
she said : ' after @entity42 had attention for two weeks and then everyone forgot about us for four years			0
but after @entity25 everything is still going on six months down the line			2
it 's like we 're being given a chance now			0
you still get one or two people that are like , " look at her she 's a wheelchair , what can she do " but most people are positive			1
' changed her life : the charity @entity61 gave @entity9 her first sports wheelchair when she was 15 @entity9 is supporting the children 's charity @entity61 's manifesto ' @entity66 ? ' that aims to build on this positive platform and continue raising awareness of those with disabilities			1
the manifesto contains the hopes and opinions of young disabled people gathered in the months following the 2012 paralympics , with their recommendations for embedding the @entity78 ’ ethos and inclusivity into everyday services			2
@entity9 personally delivered the report to @entity83 today for the government to consider			2
@entity61 gave @entity9 her first sports wheelchair at the age of 15 which she said completely transformed her life - not only because it set her on a path to become a world champion but because it gave her more day - to - day freedom			1
' the @entity90 are brilliant at providing wheelchairs but it 's not always a good fit , ' she explained			0
' @entity61 provide chairs that fit perfectly giving people the chance to get out and be independent			1
' for me , getting a sports wheelchair gave me independence so i could go out with my friends more and i could play sports like wheelchair basketball			1
' it opened a lot of doors so i could go out and not have to rely on someone else pushing me and not find things like getting up kerbs so difficult			0
' making a difference : @entity9 and friends visited @entity83 today to deliver the charity 's manifesto calling for a brighter future for disabled people sports wheelchairs have cambered wheels , sleeker tyres and are sturdier than the average day wheelchair - but also more expensive			1
there are an estimated 70,000 disabled children and young people in the @entity121 waiting for a wheelchair that fits their young lives and it 's these youngsters that @entity61 are trying to help			1
@entity9 admits her life would have been completely different had she not received her wheelchair from the charity			1
' wheelchairs , particular sports ones , cost so much and that 's the barrier stopping a lot of children being more independent or playing sport , ' she said			0
@entity9 played wheelchair basketball before taking up wheelchair racing			2
she 's had a short but successful career so far winning the @entity139 100m and 200m titles in the @entity142 category in 2011 and then repeating this feat in front of a home crowd at the @entity24			2
she 's now training to defend her world titles in @entity147 this year and looking forward to @entity148			0
@entity9 is delighted that her achievements , and those of @entity42 such as @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity153 are now inspiring young people to get into sport , in the same way she was inspired by @entity157 in her youth			2
but a @entity61 poll found that ' enthusiasm to get active is tempered by a lack of opportunity			0
more than two thirds of parents surveyed said their children ’s schools do n’t play any of the @entity168 sports			0
' meeting her majesty : the athlete shows the @entity172 her gold medals on a visit to @entity175 the charity 's report adds : ' while children may want to take up @entity179 , wheelchair basketball , archery , wheelchair tennis and other @entity168 sports , opportunities to do so at school are limited			1
our young people suggested mainstream schools and local clubs should work together to share facilities and equipment			0
' the charity manifesto adds that while it 's fantastic children now have so many sporting role models , they also want disabled people to be more visible in other areas such as in media roles like tv presenting , in fashion , the arts and politics			2
legacy : the manifesto aims to build on the success of the @entity25 2012 @entity24 while some progress has been made in wheelchair access on public transport , they would also like more to be done in this area			1
@entity9 explains : ' we should be able to get on a train like everyone but if you 're in a wheelchair you have to phone ahead before your journey to make sure there are ramps			2
i 've had loads of problems over the years on public transport			0
i start to feel like a pain asking for ramps all the time and sometimes i get forgotten and miss my stop as i 'm left on the carriage			0
' buses often only have one space for wheelchairs so if i 'm going out with a friend who is also in a wheelchair we have to get different buses			0
' @entity61 chief executive @entity237 said the charity hopes improvements can continue to be made in the coming years			1
' the @entity24 shone a spotlight on the talent , skill and ambition of disabled people			2
however it will be a hugely missed opportunity if we do n’t capitalise on the legacy of the @entity78 - and not just to create more access to sport , but to offer greater opportunity for young disabled people across all areas of society , ' she said			0
' the young wheelchair users we speak to tell us they face invisible and visible barriers every day			0
it ’s essential to keep on challenging these and make an enduring difference			0

gold medallist told @entity18 she 's often patronised because she 's in a wheelchair
but she said there have been big improvements in perceptions of people with disabilities since @entity25 2012 @entity24
she 's now helping charity @entity61 build on this to improve the lives of those with disabilities
@entity9 said getting her first sports wheelchair from the charity when she was 15 ' changed my life '
