these extraordinary images may appear to show colourful boiled sweets or even glass beads - but in fact , they show specially bred ears of corn			0
@entity7 corn was developed by a @entity9 farmer who noticed that every so often , a cob showed signs of unusual colouring shining through			1
now the unique strain is available for purchase online , and is in hot demand from gardeners keen to add a touch of colour to their vegetable patch			2
as the years went on , he managed to produce corn displaying dozens of different colours on a single cob			0
shortly before he died , mr @entity40 passed on his seed collection and breeding know - how to his friend @entity49 and asked him to safeguard the @entity7 tradition			1
in 2010 , mr @entity49 decided he had to find a permanent home for the collection , and gave the seeds to @entity54 , owner of a small seed comany in @entity56			0
blue : one strain produces corn with deep blue kernels as well as some which are almost white contrast : the different varieties of @entity7 can appear starkly divergent from one another popular : @entity63 , which sells the corn , frequently sells out thanks to the high demand on the branch : despite its rainbow colours , @entity7 is grown in the same way as other types of corn ' i was blown away , ' mr @entity54 said of the first time he grew @entity7 corn			1
' no one had ever seen corn like this before			0
' the seedsman is now head of @entity63 , a non-profit organisation which seeks to preserve the agricultural heritage of the @entity9			0
the organisation sells @entity7 seeds through its website for $ 7.95 ( Â£ 4.90 ) per packet , although they are so highly sought - after that they are frequently sold out			1
the corn can be used to make flour or popcorn , although it is not recommended to eat it straight off the cob			0
attractive : from some angles , the corn looks just like a colourful children 's toy appetising : @entity7 should not be eaten off the cob , but can be turned into flour or popcorn tradition : buyers are encouraged to keep the seeds in order to stop the corn strain dying out @entity103 - red : this is one of the most striking - looking plants produced by the seeds most customers apparently use @entity7 as an innovative gift which can be displayed as an ornament around the house			1
additionally , @entity63 encourages buyers to save their favourite strands of the corn to replant in order to continue the @entity7 tradition			2
mr @entity54 said : ' as @entity40 has taught us , all it takes is one person to create a more colourful , diverse and abundant world - one seed at a time			2
' @entity122 shoots : this slender plant will eventually grow up to produce ears of multi-coloured corn all wrapped up : the corn is surrounded by green leaves before breaking out of its shell @entity130 : @entity40 spent years developing @entity7 corn and passed the secret on before he died			1

@entity7 corn developed by @entity40 was passed on after his death
now the seeds are available online and have attracted huge demand
