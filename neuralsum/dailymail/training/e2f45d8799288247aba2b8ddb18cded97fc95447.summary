by @entity0 , @entity1 published : 16:01 est , 4 may 2013 updated : 09:40 est , 5 may 2013 in the unlikely event – as they say in safety briefings – that the entire flight crew of the new £ 250million double - decker @entity7 superjumbo were to be struck down by a dodgy prawn , then i ’m your man			1
when that call goes up ‘ can anyone here fly this plane ? ’ , i am fairly confident after spending a couple of hours in @entity17 ’ £ 10million scarily lifelike simulator at their @entity20 base that i might just have a fighting chance of a decent stab at it			1
and believe me , this looks , feels and performs just like the real deal – so much so that if you ’re not a good flier and prone to airsickness , you may even feel a bit queasy at some of the more energetic manoeuvres			1
before entering service in october			1
@entity17 ’s inaugural flight and regular service will be the ‘ red carpet ’ @entity51 route to @entity52 – or ‘ lax ’ to use the aviation jargon , which @entity56 screen star @entity55 launched earlier this year			1
so what better place for my first try out			2
i have been in the cockpit of an @entity7 before – most notably for an hour or so with an @entity7 test pilot team over the @entity62 desert on an early @entity7 ‘ proving flight ’ between @entity64 and @entity65			1
but never before at the controls			2
and i am truly an untrained amateur			2
so here ’s the scene			2
i am sitting with safety straps on in a straight backed supportive pilot ’s seat inside the vast cockpit of this leviathan of the skies with – in the real world anyway – nearly 500 passengers behind me			2
actress @entity55 launched @entity17 ' ' @entity77 ' to @entity52 earlier this year the @entity7 flight simulator is designed to mimic the movements of the plane in flight the @entity7 is a double - decker plane with room for 469 passengers i am looking out through the wraparound cockpit window at the freakily lifelike but entirely computer - generated runway and control tower of @entity52			1
immediately in front , behind and above me is a vast array of illuminated buttons , lights , switches and controls			2
it makes the flight deck of the @entity96 look like a piece of cake			2
to my left is arguably the most important piece of kit on this fly - by - wire plane – the joystick			1
it ’s not child ’s play			2
but i ’d wager many children who irritate their parents by spending hours on their computer games with a force - feedback joystick would be better placed than many adults when it comes to being prepared for what happens next			2
we ’re set up for take - off , so @entity35 instructs me push forward on the power			2
we rumble along the runway picking up speed as i wait to hit the magic 130knots			2
as @entity35 reads out ‘ 135 ’ i ease back on the joystick and the rumble retreats as we gently but powerfully take to the skies			2
as we ascend for a minute or so and then level out the noise of the engines recedes and i take in the scene below			2
a lovely day , great views of @entity52 and the coast			1
i take a lazy arc around the @entity128 , then down to @entity129 to wave at the ‘ @entity132 ’ branch of my @entity0 clan relatives			1
a light touch is needed to keep the plane from flapping all over the place from over-corrections			1
you ’re a chauffeur not a jet fighter pilot			0
experience of driving supercars and their speed - sensitive steering may help , however , to reduce the risk of the plane ‘ boating ’ back and forth			1
what goes up must come down so landing was next			0
' your life will be safe in my hands ' : the @entity150 's @entity0 is confident his simulator experience means he could man a plane in an emergency @entity35 helpfully provided all the settings			1
i had to guide it in keeping to the glide path , keeping it straight , and keeping it high – or low – enough			0
eyes on the landing lights			0
half red and half white is the ideal			0
a bit too far to the left and a tilt on the tiller			0
as you get closer the ground rushes up : three , two , one , a little clunk – hardly an angel ’s footsteps – but we ’re down			0
relief and joy all round			0
for my next flight it was a night - time take off from @entity182 ’s @entity181 and an evening ’s birds ’ eye cruise around the skyscrapers of @entity186 – slightly disconcerting initially given the memories of the 9 - 11 tragedy			0
but once into my stride a loop past the @entity193 , the @entity189 and the @entity190 was fun			0
this time though the landing was n’t			0
with an evil glint @entity35 programmed in some turbulence and a bit of cross-wind , just to test my mettle			0
i even had a couple of minutes white - out fog and cloud to try it on instruments only			0
as i vectored in and battled with the wind , my respect for real plots grew enormously			0
the plane did land back in the @entity209 , but let ’s just say ‘ touchdown ’ does n’t really cover it and i would not like to have been a passenger			1
@entity216 in mind this is not a static activity			0
this cockpit is inside a giant pod – a bit like the shuttle craft on @entity222 - held up on powerful hydraulics which react exactly to programed to conditions and to your flying			0
get it wrong and it bucks like a bronco			0
during the session we also simulated what in aviation is benignly termed a ‘ loss of separation ’ – or to you and me ‘ a near miss '			0
bad enough the sight of another plane shooting across your vision			1
the automated ‘ @entity245 ’ collision avoidance system kicks in telling you ‘ descend , descend , descend			0
’ actually it is so clever that the rival planes communicate electronically so that each is instructed to take opposing avoiding action that keeps them apart			0
the simulator is the latest of 16 which @entity17 uses to train its pilots on all @entity256 and @entity7 planes in its fleet			1
this is the only @entity7 simulator and is not yet open to the public			1
but the others are available for private and corporate hire in a variety of packages at rates from £ 399 for an hour or £ 1,197 for three hours at @entity265			0
curiously that ’s about the same cost as a real long - haul return flight to the @entity269			0
@entity0 took the simulated @entity7 on flights from @entity52 and @entity182 's @entity181 airports @entity17 is already taking superjumbo bookings for @entity7 flights from @entity20 to @entity52 from october 15 starting at £ 499 return in economy and £ 1,900 in @entity17 business			1
there are 469 seats in total of which 14 are first class ‘ upstairs ’			0
actress @entity55 said : ' it ’s very exciting that @entity7 will be flying to @entity52			1
i think the red carpet route will be very popular			0
’ @entity17 chief executive @entity284 said : ' the @entity7 is a great aircraft that has been developed with huge amounts of @entity56 engineering ingenuity			1
@entity20 and @entity288 are two world - leading cities and we are proud to be the first airline to connect them with the @entity7			1
’ flights to @entity64 begin in mid november from £ 599 return in economy			1
it takes 18 months and £ 100,000 to train a commercial airline pilot from scratch , that ’s once he or she passes the strict entry criteria , including no colour blindness			1
to make captain will take up to 12 years , and on some long - haul flights between 15 and 20			1
so back to my dodgy prawn in the cockpit scenario			0
what , i asked my tutor @entity35 , in the worst case ‘ unlikely event ’ is the one button on this vast cockpit dashboard that i should press if i really needed to get out of trouble ? he pointed to a small yellow illuminated button at the centre			0
it ’ll even land the plane for you , ’ he said			1
see , i told you you ’d be safe in my hands			0
each @entity7 costs £ 250million , while the simulator alone is worth £ 10million			1

@entity150 's @entity0 takes the helm of @entity17 's @entity7 simulator
@entity17 start flights with the plane to @entity52 in october
