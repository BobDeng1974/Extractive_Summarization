by @entity0 published : 03:53 est , 21 june 2012 updated : 10:07 est , 21 june 2012 this may be smoke without a fire - or it could be we are about to get an announcement which will fundamentally change our knowledge of the universe			1
the physics world has been set alight with a wildfire rumour that @entity11 will announce they have discovered the @entity12 - that elusive ' @entity14 ' particle which is believed to give all other particles their mass. even @entity17 went crazy for the elusive particle , with @entity19 at the top of the @entity21 lists on wednesday			1
the particle accelerator : it is within these tubes that physicists are hunting for the ' @entity14 ' particle physics blogger @entity26 , who writes for @entity27 , started the discussions , saying that @entity11 had replicated last year 's study which seemed to spot the particle			1
this year 's result saw the same spiking as the tests last year , indicating last year 's result were not a mistake or aberration			1
@entity26 write : ' to oversimplify the situation , last year both experiments were seeing roughly a 3 sigma excess in gamma - gamma around 125 gev			1
' while @entity26 says this is oversimplifying matters , this may still be a but too much for anyone without an advanced desgree in particle physics			2
the even simpler form is that in 2011 , @entity11 was hoping to see spikes in their two experiments , which would offer evidence to support the hypothetical particle			1
and these spikes did occur			0
@entity26 continues : ' this was enough to convince many people that it was highly likely that this was the @entity12			1
however , that size excess is not completely convincing , it is not unheard of for there to be statistical flukes of such size			0
' the 2012 data that is being analysed ... is of a similar size to the 2011 data			0
' if 2011 was a fluke , you expect to see nothing much around 125 gev in the 2012 data			0
' if the 2011 signal really was the @entity12 you expect the signal to strengthen			2
what i â€™m hearing from both experiments is that they are seeing an excess in the new data , strengthening the significance of the signal			2
' an aerial view of the @entity81 - @entity80 border , indicating the route of the @entity83 inside : the giant project is the most enormous piece of scientific apparatus ever constructed , and is buried 100m beneath the ground most analysts say that any such announcement can not be made until every figure has been checked and cross-checked			0
when the @entity93 reported on the rumours , @entity11 spokesman @entity92 replied : ' please do not believe the blogs			2
' the @entity97 's @entity96 added : ' as a member of the @entity100 , i know precisely what we have			0
' but my loyalty remains with my collaboration , especially the people who are working right now to carry out the analysis and verify the results , as well as to the people at the top who have to chart strategy and make difficult decisions			0
' a little splash in a blog is not worth the bother it would cause all these people			0

results for experiments to find - or rule out - the @entity12 expected on july 4
blogs and rumours *suggest* a *positive* result
particle will complete @entity126 's theory of the universe
