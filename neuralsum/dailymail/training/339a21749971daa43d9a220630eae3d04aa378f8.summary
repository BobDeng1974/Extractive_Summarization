by @entity0 published : 02:01 est , 26 march 2012 updated : 18:44 est , 26 march 2012 this is the moment when a father thought he was seeing his son die as a hot air balloon burst into flames after hitting 132,000 - volt power cables			1
watching from another balloon , @entity7 feared the worst as 18 - year - old @entity9 drifted into the overhead lines			1
as he landed in a nearby field , mr @entity7 , 42 , heard bolts of electricity blasting through the canopy of his son ’s craft			1
hit : this is the dramatic moment the balloon crashed into the cables and was set alight , caught on camera by bystander @entity21 at about 6pm on sunday drama : three teenagers were left suspended 15 metres above the ground as they waited for the overhead cables to be turned off then the small basket under the balloon containing @entity9 and his two companions was set ablaze by showers of sparks			1
convinced that @entity9 had been killed , mr @entity7 sprinted back to the scene			2
he added : ‘ i had landed a couple of fields along when i heard the bang			2
i thought @entity9 was dead			2
the basket was on fire and he was stuck in the cables			2
’ as the passengers , @entity39 and a girl aged 16 who has not been named , cowered in the bottom of the 9ft - square basket , @entity9 doused the flames with a fire extinguisher			1
@entity9 was unhurt , mr @entity39 suffered a burned shoulder and the teenager ’s hair was singed			1
terrifying accident : pilot @entity50 , 18 , suffered burns when he and two teenage passengers crashed into an electricity pylon , absorbing 132,000 volts then , after their brush with death , the passengers – who had not been in a hot air balloon before – and their pilot played i - spy as they dangled 45ft off the ground for five hours waiting for the power to be switched off so they could be brought down by rescue teams			1
mr @entity39 , 52 , said they had to ‘ curl up like hedgehogs ’ as they smashed into the wires , adding : ‘ it was like being inside a firework			2
there were a lot of sparks			2
‘ this sort of thing kills people – we were very lucky to walk away from the scene			2
‘ as we dropped below the wires we were waiting for contact , thinking it would cause a spark			0
when the wires twanged on the basket we did think , “ this will hurt ”			0
‘ the experience definitely used up one of my nine lives			0
’ @entity9 and his father were in two of six balloons that had taken off together from a field at @entity89 , @entity90 , on sunday afternoon			0
they had travelled about ten miles when a gust blew @entity9 into pylons near @entity94 , @entity95 , just before 6pm			1
@entity9 , from @entity96 , @entity95 , said : ‘ i did panic after hitting the wires			1
‘ there was quite a bang when we hit the power lines , and then i saw there was a fire in the basket			0
‘ it is all a bit of a blur really , but it was scary			0
‘ you go through all these things in your training but it still does n’t come into play until it actually happens			0
’ and he added : ‘ it wo n’t put me off flying balloons			0
i ’ve been doing it since i was a baby			0
’ rescue : emergency services had to wait until 11pm for the power to be turned off so they could get to the hot air balloon mr @entity39 , himself an amateur aeroplane pilot , said the waistcoat he had been wearing was ‘ full of holes on the back ’ from where he was hit by ‘ little gobbets of fire ’			1
he added that the trio passed the time with games as they waited for rescue			1
the marketing data manager said : ‘ we played i - spy			0
but after we had “ g ” for “ grass ” and “ p ” for “ pylon ” we did n’t have many more ideas			1
‘ the wind picked up and the basket was moving to and fro , but there was nothing we could do			0
we did get very cold , but you just cope			0
’ when they were rescued at 11pm , each of them was harnessed to a fireman who abseiled down the pylon			1
hanging : the three passengers had to put out a fire started on impact with the pylon danger : pilot @entity50 and two others were forced to cower in the basket for five hours while waiting for the electricity to be turned off the incident is being investigated by the @entity158			1
however , mr @entity7 believes a sudden change in wind direction caused the ‘ freak accident ’			0
he said the £ 25,000 @entity163 - 77 balloon had been destroyed in the accident , but added : ‘ i ’m just so glad @entity9 ’s all right			0
it could have been so much worse			0
’ despite his ordeal , mr @entity39 is determined to have another flight , joking : ‘ i will be going up in a balloon again as i want to experience a normal landing			0
’ deflated : the balloon 's limp outline is shown silhouetted against the @entity95 sky as it drapes over the power cables blocked : police diverted traffic away from the scene as the trio were trapped above ground for five hours			1

@entity180 blew the trio into a @entity95 pylon carrying 132,000 volts
pilot @entity50 , 18 , and his two passengers suffered minor burns
they were left hanging between 6pm and 11pm last night
