when the two teams walk out of the @entity3 tunnel on sunday afternoon there will be one amongst them wearing a @entity6 kit under his @entity8 garbs			1
ten - year - old @entity10 , a @entity6 fan , was handed a late @entity12 present by his father , @entity14 striker @entity13 , when he was told he had got him a place as a home mascot in their @entity18 third - round tie			1
the fixture is one of the biggest in @entity14 's history and @entity13 admits , at 35 - years - old , that it will be the greatest in his long career as a forward			1
' @entity10 said he wants to wear his @entity6 kit under his @entity14 kit , ' @entity13 explained			1
' he was buzzing about the draw			0
' i only told him on tuesday he was going to get to be a mascot as well			2
so it 's even better he 's going to get to shake hands with all the players			0
he just ca n't wait for the game			2
' @entity10 's favourite player is @entity30 and though @entity13 draws the line at asking for the @entity55 striker 's shirt at half - time , he added : ' he 's asked me if i can try and get something off him			1
i 'll do my best			0
@entity10 might be asking it before the game in the tunnel when he 's lining up			1
it will be a good day for him			0
' @entity13 's wife and two younger daughters will be at @entity14 's home for the game , although his parents , @entity67 and @entity68 , are unable to attend			1
they famously missed the moment their son scored the fastest hat - trick in @entity73 history , his first match after @entity10 was born a decade ago			1
@entity13 , playing for @entity75 at the time , came from the bench in the 84th minute in a match against @entity79 at @entity80 in february 2004 , scored with his first touch and netted twice more within 140 seconds			1
but his parents had left the ground early to catch a ferry back to their home in the @entity86			0
@entity13 is famous for scoring the fastest hat - trick in @entity73 history in 2004 @entity13 ( right ) celebrates with @entity14 team - mates after scoring against @entity89 in last year 's 3rd round ' they were listening to the radio on the way back , ' @entity13 said			1
' they heard a cheer on the way out and put the radio on and heard it was mine and were annoyed			0
then listened in the car on the way to the ferry and heard i scored another two			0
they were obviously pleased , but they 'd left to get the earlier ferry			0
they still shake their heads about it			0
' his father is too unwell to travel to the match , but they will be watching back home on television , eager not to miss this one			0
@entity13 spent a large part of his career at @entity75 , on their books as a teenager before enjoying a decade on the south coast between 1997 and 2007			1
while there , he heard stories about @entity75 's famous victory against @entity6 , under manager @entity123 , to knock them out of the cup in 1984			1
@entity13 was only five at the time			2
yet @entity14 have an even richer history of giant killing , knocking out 17 professional sides when they were a non-league club			2
' it is something the manager @entity130 has spoken to us about in the previous two rounds , ' @entity13 added			2
' he said that this was almost what @entity14 was known for			0
' people know about @entity14 as they did so well in the @entity18 as a non-league team and they are one of the teams that has knocked the most league teams out			0
this club has a real history in the @entity18			0
' victory for the @entity143 team against this @entity6 side , worth hundreds of millions of pounds , will be perhaps mark their greatest moment of all			2
everyone in a @entity14 shirt will be celebrating wildly , apart from a young boy with his @entity6 kit on underneath .			2
