missing : terror suspect @entity1 who was under close police surveillance has gone missing , it emerged this evening @entity3 last night launched a nationwide manhunt after an @entity6 - linked terror suspect went on the run			1
@entity8 - born @entity1 , 28 , was being held under security measures because of the threat he poses to the public			1
he has not been seen since @entity12			0
counter-terrorism detectives made the unusual decision to appeal for help to trace the extremist after he went missing			2
home secretary @entity17 had earlier asked the @entity18 to lift a ban on identifying him over fears he may try to meet other terror suspects or flee the country			2
the police appeal came as a second terror suspect and former associate of @entity28 appeared in court accused of breaching a similar order			1
both men were being held under @entity34 and @entity35 ( @entity33 ) notices , which were introduced in january 2012			1
@entity1 ’s disappearance is a blow to the government ’s @entity33 programme , which critics have warned is a ‘ watered down ’ version of the previous control order regime			1
@entity1 is thought to be a member of a @entity45 - based network that supports the @entity47 terrorist group which controls much of @entity8 and is affiliated to @entity6			1
police were alerted on @entity12 that he had gone missing after he failed to return to his overnight accommodation			2
he was last seen in @entity50 , @entity51 , wearing a khaki robe , navy @entity54 plimsolls and a black @entity56 anorak			1
’ gone : the last sighting of @entity1 was in the @entity50 area of north @entity51 on @entity12 @entity1 had been forced to live in the @entity59 under a control order imposed in october 2009			1
when @entity61 were introduced last year he returned to @entity51 because the law no longer allowed ministers to relocate him			1
this was despite an earlier @entity18 ruling that it was ‘ too dangerous ’ to allow him to return to @entity51 ‘ even for a short period ’			1
the judge was told moving him from @entity51 would disrupt his extremist activities and stop him planning or carrying out terrorism			1
@entity1 is the first terrorist suspect to abscond while under a new monitoring regime called @entity71			1
these ‘ @entity61 ’ were introduced a year ago to replace the previous regime of control orders at the insistence of the @entity75 after a major @entity77 row			1
opponents of @entity61 say their introduction has weakened public protection			2
the shift to @entity61 cut the number of hours a terror suspect could be forced to obey a home curfew from 16 hours a day to ten			0
it also meant suspects could no longer be forced to change address and would be allowed restricted use of mobile phones and the internet			0
the changes mean the police and security services must wrestle with terror suspects spending an extra six hours a day on the streets			2
as a result of the new burden , ministers promised an extra £ 30million to spend on investigation and surveillance			0
unlike their predecessors , @entity61 must lapse after two years unless there is new evidence of continued terrorist activity			0
there are now ten terror suspects under @entity61 , including @entity1			1
in july it emerged that one suspected terrorist on a @entity109 was found five times near the @entity112 venue			0
he had been jailed after 15 breaches of his control order , including attempts to buy a computer and visiting an internet café			1
the former associate of @entity28 , known only as ‘ @entity119 ’ , received terrorist training in @entity8 and fought alongside rebel soldiers			0
‘ @entity119 ’ also helped procure weapons for terrorists and planned attacks in @entity8 and overseas			0
he appeared amid high security at @entity127 ’ court yesterday accused of six breaches of his @entity109			0
@entity1 travelled to @entity45 as a refugee aged 12			2
his wife continues to live in a @entity51 council flat			2
@entity18 documents detail how @entity1 , a married former train conductor and father of five , is closely linked to the @entity135			2
he was arrested in 2007 after returning from an @entity47 terrorist training camp he attended with @entity137 , a close friend			0
@entity1 was detained in @entity138 and found to be carrying three new mobile phones and over £ 3,000 cash			2
while being held he tried to destroy phone numbers by eating a piece of paper			0
the following year , police in @entity51 stopped @entity1 and found he was carrying £ 1,000 in cash			1
detectives believe the money was for terrorist associates			0
he was also accused of sending associates to @entity8 to join terrorist fighters by providing money , false passports and other documents			0
@entity137 , 27 , was killed in a @entity155 drone strike last which hit his car near @entity157			0
he had joined @entity159 fighters after being stripped of his @entity45 citizenship 12 months earlier and deported			0
a @entity3 spokesman said @entity1 does not represent a ‘ direct threat ’ to the public			1
however , he warned members of the public not to approach @entity166			0
@entity167 , the independent reviewer of terror legislation , said no security measure is ‘ foolproof ’			0
he said experts believe there may be 50 @entity45 fighters in @entity8 , adding : ‘ worst case , there could now be one more – an influential one			0
’ speaking about @entity61 , he said : ‘ the only sure way to prevent absconding is to lock people in a high - security prison			0
’ security minister @entity180 said : ‘ the home secretary today applied to the @entity18 for an order protecting anonymity to be lifted in order to assist with their investigation			2
we do not believe [ @entity1 ’s ] disappearance is linked to any terrorism planning in the @entity45			1

counter terrorism detectives today appealed to the public for help in tracing @entity1
he is believed to have absconded from a terror control order known as a @entity34 and @entity35 notice
the 28 - year - old was last seen in @entity50 , @entity51
police have urged anyone who sees @entity1 to ring *999* immediately
