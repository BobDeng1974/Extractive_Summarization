a woman of simple tastes : @entity2 pictured in 1977 @entity3 , jam sandwiches and chocolate cake are some of the @entity2 's favourite foods , according to her former personal chef			1
@entity8 , who worked at the @entity10 kitchens for fifteen years , has revealed that away from the spotlight the 86 - year - old @entity13 @entity12 is a woman of simple tastes			1
while she feasts on elaborate dishes at state banquets , when at home she enjoys uncomplicated cuisine			2
@entity8 said that she traditionally starts the day with a light breakfast followed by lunch , afternoon tea and dinner , topped off with a generous gin and @entity25 before bedtime			1
the 49 - year - old chef , who also cooked for @entity28 and @entity29 ’ @entity30 and @entity31 , said that cornflakes or @entity3 were popular requests at the breakfast table , with a helping of dried fruit or macadamia nuts			1
while @entity39 tea was the drink of choice			2
a typical lunch , served at 1pm , would be fish , such as a grilled @entity45 sole , placed on a bed of wilted spinach			0
' she loved grilled @entity45 sole			0
really simple , light and no sauce			2
clean and simple that was how she liked it , ' he told @entity56			1
then there would be afternoon tea of cakes , scones and sandwiches using de-crusted bread			0
honey sponge , ginger cake and the chocolate biscuit recipe that prince @entity30 chose to be served at his wedding reception were the top sweet treats and @entity8 would also rustle up his special @entity68			1
simple , but given the royal seal of approval : jam sandwiches and @entity3 are two of the @entity2 's top treats chefs prepare a state banquet at @entity75 , but her majesty does n't always go for the finest foods ' @entity2 loves chocolate , and the @entity68 was one of her favourites			1
it has three layers and i think the word perfection sums up her 60 - year reign			2
' but when she ate alone the @entity2 would prefer fruit over pudding			0
' chocolate is one of her favourites but when she dined alone she would just have a dish of fruit , an apple or a peach			0
' breakfast : cereal , dried fruit , macadamia nuts lunch : grilled @entity45 sole , wilted spinach , courgette afternoon tea : selection of cakes , scones and sandwiches dinner : venison from @entity107 , white peaches from @entity75 , gin and @entity25 at least two varieties of sandwich were offered , such as cucumber or egg mayonnaise , with the crusts cut off			0
‘ even if she ’s on her own , there ’s sandwiches with the crusts off , white and brown ; plain scones one day , fruit the next ; a whole ginger or chocolate cake or a honey and cream sponge and small cakes like chocolate éclairs			2
' she ’ll only have one or two sandwiches and maybe a sliver of cake			0
’ mr @entity8 also spent his day making jam pennies - miniature raspberry jam sandwiches cut into circles the size of an old @entity136 penny - during his time in the royal household			1
in the evening she would normally have a gin and @entity25 ; one part gin and two parts @entity25			0
the @entity2 's love of the drink is well - documented , and when the @entity146 documentary @entity145 showed a butler mixing one for her , demand for the product went through the roof			2
former @entity10 chef @entity8 then for dinner there would be game or fish such as pheasant from @entity157 or venison or salmon from @entity107			1
for pudding , fresh fruit , particularly the white peaches grown in greenhouses at @entity75			0
' game from any of the royal household were popular and peaches were her favourite			0
he started at @entity10 in 1982 , when he was 20 , the most junior of 20 cooks in the kitchens , although he had already risen to chef de partie saucier ( head sauce chef ) at the @entity173			1
his royal cv has taken him to @entity175 , where he is now private chef to mrs @entity177 , widow of a billionaire philanthropist in @entity179 , @entity180			0
but even now , he doubts the @entity2 has cooked a meal in her life			1
' at the end of the meal , the @entity2 will rinse the plates , that ’s her contribution			2
' when i worked for princess @entity28 , she ’d occasionally cook a little something when she had friends over , maybe pasta with a @entity190 that ’s something the @entity2 would never do			0
’ to celebrate the launch of @entity192 and the @entity193 , @entity8 has created the @entity194			1
