@entity1 boss @entity0 insists the start of the managerial merry - go - round has not put him under any more pressure			1
@entity5 visit the @entity6 in the @entity7 on saturday with @entity9 assistant @entity8 at the helm with @entity11 poised for a return to @entity13			2
the sacking of @entity15 at @entity16 was followed almost immediately by the dismissal of @entity18 at @entity19 and @entity0 would appear to be the one now most under threat with his side bottom of the @entity23 and four points from safety			1
@entity0 , pictured on the touchline against @entity27 , admits he could be sacked by the club 's owners @entity1 's @entity30 celebrates scoring his side 's equaliser against @entity27 on @entity33 a cup game is probably the last thing he wants having taken an important four points from their last two matches but knows his future will not be decided on whether @entity1 are successful in the knock - out competition			1
and the fact @entity5 are currently in a state of flux will not affect his planning for the game			2
' i probably wo n't change my approach at all , ' he said			2
' unfortunately before @entity47 there were none and now there are three of four ( managerial ) changes			0
' football has been blighted with too many changes - this season has been slightly different , but one goes and it seems to be a signal for changes			0
' i ca n't spend too much time analysing how that works out as i am sure @entity8 will be preparing his home town side very well			0
' all i can do is focus on our own situation			0
i will always do the job i feel is correct for us but it is inevitable as a manager you will lose your job			0
@entity68 fan @entity67 scored a stunning goal for @entity1 against @entity27 at @entity70 @entity0 will come up against @entity5 caretaker boss @entity8 in the @entity7 on saturday ' what i know about our owners is we have a very good personal and working relationship and their decision will always be based on what is right for the club			1
' i am in no position to argue any different to any other manager			1
they will do what is right			0
' clearly our priority is the @entity23			1
' @entity0 will make a number of changes for the cup match as he tries to lessen the effect of four matches over the festive period			1
while a win against @entity5 would provide an important confidence - booster the @entity91 boss believes his side have already shown they can compete against established @entity23 clubs			1
' it is fair to say we have made a number of changes through this period of games but there is no right or wrong way to do it , ' he said			2
' to play against @entity5 at home gives us the chance to build on some decent results but it is inevitable there will be changes			0
@entity1 fans celebrate in the background after @entity30 's impressive strike against @entity114 ' side ' but throughout the season i do n't think you 've heard me talk about disappointing performances			1
' it is never easy to sell the idea to people that the belief and commitment is there and we think we are good enough			0
' it is about results and we had a testing second half to 2014 and we have to see what we can do for the remainder of the season			0
' as a side coming up it is never easy to compete at the same level against established @entity23 clubs but all the sides who were promoted last season have shown ability over the last few weeks to get results			1
' we have to try to build on that			0
we are still not in a great position but we have to build on the positives we have had and not concentrate on what people are saying			2
' it is important to stay in touch but at the same time we have to make up ground			0
