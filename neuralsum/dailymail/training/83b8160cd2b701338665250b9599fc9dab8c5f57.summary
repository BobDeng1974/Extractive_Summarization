scientists say they have created an @entity2 drug so powerful that it could work as a vaccine			1
macaque monkeys given the drug were able to fend off high , repeated doses of the simian version of the disease			1
the protein - based drug has been ' astonishingly effective ' at blocking every major strain of @entity13 tested , marking a major step towards a cure for @entity16 , the researchers claim			1

pictured is an image of @entity13 particles infecting a human cell when @entity13 infects a cell , it targets the @entity30 lymphocyte , an integral part of the body 's immune system			1
@entity13 fuses with the cell and inserts its own genetic material -- in this case , single - stranded rna - and transforms the host cell into a @entity13 manufacturing site			2
the prototype drug , called @entity40 , is made up of two imitations of the receptors			0
these are the docking points where @entity13 latches on to @entity30 cells — the key defences of the immune cells			2
the mimics latch on to the virus , tricking it into prematurely launching the docking procedure			0
the virus can only execute the procedure once , rendering it unable to attach to @entity30 cells			2
the scientists likened the effect to closing the door to an intruder and tossing away the key			0
the technique works by using gene therapy to introduce a new section of @entity61 inside healthy cells			1
' we show a way to achieve long - lived , effective vaccine - like protection from @entity13 ' , said study leader @entity67 , a professor at the @entity68 in @entity69			1

the drug provides ' very , very strong protection , ' professor @entity67 said who wants to conduct human trials ' soon '			1
the team undertook a 40 - week experiment which showed that inoculated animals thrived even after being injected with four times the dose needed to infect macaques in a ' control ' group			1
further research , to be unveiled at a conference in @entity101 next week , found that the treated macaques ' continue to be protected from eight times and 16 times the infectious dose , more than a year after inoculation , ' professor @entity67 said			2
the search for a vaccine has been one of the most frustrating chapters of the @entity16 saga			0
traditional antibody - based candidate vaccines have failed to put up more than a partial shield , partly because of mutations in the stealthy virus			1
' this is an exciting new approach , but until the vaccine has been trialled in humans , there 's no way of knowing how effective it will be , ' said dr @entity122 , director of external affairs at @entity123 the new prototype formula , though , targets sites on the virus ' so - called @entity128 entry protein that are ' highly conserved ' - a scientific term meaning that these sites do not mutate very much			0
lab - dish tests have found that the drug also works on human hiv , which is very close to simian version of the virus			1
' of course , we still need to do further safety studies in both macaques and humans , ' before any trials can take place , professor @entity67 stressed			0

the team undertook a 40 - week experiment which showed that inoculated monkeys thrived even after being injected with four times the dose needed to infect macaques in a ' control ' group ' although this vaccine was found to be effective in monkeys , @entity13 is an incredibly complex virus , with many different facets that we are still learning about			1
' since 1981 , about 78 million people have been infected by the hiv virus which destroys immune cells and leaves the body exposed to tuberculosis , pneumonia and other opportunistic diseases			2
thirty - nine million have died , according to @entity164 estimates			0
antiretroviral drugs , invented in the mid- 1990s , can treat infection , but can not cure it or prevent it			0
treatment is lifelong and carries side - effects			0
for many health systems , the drugs bill is spiralling , becoming a major burden to budgets .			0

drug uses gene therapy to introduce new *dna* inside healthy cells
monkeys could fend off @entity13 despite being injected with 4 times the dose
lab - dish tests have found that @entity184 - @entity183 drug works well on human hiv
previous hiv vaccines failed to do this because virus mutates so *rapidly*
scientists in @entity69 say they are *hoping* to conduct human trial ' soon '
