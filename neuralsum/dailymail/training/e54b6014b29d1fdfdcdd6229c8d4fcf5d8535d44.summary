by @entity0 a video of two unsuspecting fast food employees who were the victims of a practical joke pulled by an @entity5 youtuber has gone viral			0
so far the clip - which lasts for almost four minutes - of @entity7 performing the prank call has attracted more than 160,000 views			1
it involves @entity7 putting two @entity12 employees on the phone to each other using the ' merge calls ' function on his mobile phone			1
a pizza chain employee named ' @entity29 ' greets him and prepares to take his pick - up order			0
@entity7 - whose friend is having trouble keeping his amused laughter at bay off - camera - orders two deep pan pepperoni pizzas , two thin ' n ' crispy @entity37 pizzas , two cheesy breads and a 1.25 - litre bottle of coke under the name of ' @entity42 '			0
at one point , it looks like @entity7 is about to break his facade and lose his composure , but he keeps it together and tells @entity29 to hold on - saying he has to ask his friend what dessert he wants to order			2
while @entity29 is on hold , @entity7 then dials the number of the @entity53 branch - also in @entity21 's south - of @entity12			1
@entity7 posted the video on @entity55 and so far it has had more than 160,000 views two employees - one from the @entity58 ( pictured ) and one from the @entity60 - were victims of the prank a ' @entity62 ' answers the phone and asks him : ' would you like pick - up or delivery ? ' @entity7 tells her to hold and proceeds to take @entity29 off hold , and asks him to read the order back - but not before @entity7 merges the calls so @entity62 thinks @entity29 is the one placing the order			1
what ensues is a lot of confusion on the part of both employees who do n't realise that neither is placing an order , but trying to take an order			0
this is where @entity7 and his friend really start to get a kick out of the prank - trying to stifle their laughter			2
in the footage , @entity7 and his friend can not contain their delight at the prank after the prank , @entity7 and his friend burst out laughing , and jump up and down with joy after about two minutes , the employees finally figure out what is going on			1
' so you have n't called me ? ' @entity62 said			0
@entity29 confirmed that he did n't and then added : ' sounds like someone is stuffing us around			0
' the video ends with the employees hanging up , and @entity7 and his friend finally being able to laugh out loud freely .			2

@entity21 's @entity7 has *uploaded* a four - minute video on @entity55
the video showing the prank has so far attracted more than *120,000* hits
@entity7 calls the @entity24 store and then the @entity53 store
he uses the ' merge calls ' function on his @entity27 to *orchestrate* the trick
this meant when one of them read back the order it sounded like they were placing an order
it took the employees about two minutes to figure out what was *happening*
