putting the first man on the moon may have seemed like a giant leap at the time , but it will soon seem like a tiny step if @entity7 's plans for space exploration come to pass			1
during last night ’s @entity11 programme , the renowned astrophysicist said we will have settlements on the moon ‘ within 50 years ’ , and believes there will be people living on @entity17 by 2100			1
and if we fail to colonise new planets , professor @entity7 believes the human race faces imminent extinction because there will be too many of us for the @entity22 to support			2
we must anticipate these threats and have a plan @entity30 ‘ if our species is to survive the next hundred years , let alone a thousand , it is imperative we voyage out into the blackness of space to colonise new worlds across the cosmos			0
’ ‘ if we follow this path , i have no doubt that this century will go down , in the history of humankind , as the true @entity45			0
’ last night , the @entity46 travelled over the @entity47 , before it passed over land above @entity49			1
the @entity46 then headed in a north - easterly direction , and crossed the @entity51			0
the sun had set and it was night by the time it approached @entity56 and @entity57 @entity58 posted this image of mission control in @entity61 during the live programme			0
@entity63 was one of the first people to use a robotic arm to capture a free - flying supply ship from the space station , and last night she served as the @entity68 ( capsule communicator ) to @entity70 ( right ) and @entity71 ( left ) the route of the @entity46 would make @entity74 green with envy - and perhaps with more than a little motion sickness			1
travelling at 17,500mph ( 28,100km/h ) , the @entity46 can go around the word 16 times per day - that ’s once every ninety minutes			1
last night , @entity79 made contact with the space station as it passed over @entity82 while @entity83 were enjoying a mid morning coffee			2
the @entity46 then proceeded down the west coast of the @entity86 and @entity87			0
in @entity88 , it saw mountains and jungle as it passes over the north of the @entity92 , and cut across the south of @entity94			0
this was followed by a long haul over the @entity47 , before it made landfall again around @entity98 then headed in a north - easterly direction , and crossed the @entity51			0
it was night when it approached @entity56 and @entity57			0
the last land spotted by the space station was part of @entity104 , after which the @entity46 rocketed over the @entity105 , to once more fly over the west coast of the @entity86 – by which time @entity83 were sitting down for lunch			2
professor @entity7 made the comments during @entity79 ’s @entity108 : lap of the @entity110 programme , during which astronauts from the @entity46 ( @entity46 ) were broadcast live from orbit			1
the @entity46 is the third brightest object in the night sky , after the sun and the moon , and can be seen as a tiny light on a clear night			2
the show provided a clearer view of just what goes on , onboard the @entity46 including what they get up to all day in their celestial home and office			1
in one scene , astronaut @entity70 revealed he has regular contact with home : ‘ i spend more time talking to my kids up here than i do down there , ’ he joked			0
and there were plenty of stunning sights of planet as the @entity46 made an entire lap of the @entity22 in just 90 minutes			1
however , images from @entity138 archives also revealed a darker side to @entity22			0
during one poignant moment , @entity86 astronaut @entity140 , recalled how he saw smoke rising from @entity144 's @entity143 while onboard the @entity46 the haunting photos and video , first revealed earlier this month by @entity147 , were shot by @entity140 as he looked down helplessly on @entity144 on september 11 , 2001			1
@entity149 astronaut major @entity148 is one of the stars of a two - and - a - half - hour pioneering live broadcast from the @entity46 and @entity152 in @entity61 on sunday on @entity79			1
video grab from the show is pictured during the show , @entity86 astronaut @entity140 , recalled how he saw smoke rising from @entity144 's @entity143 while onboard the @entity46 in 2001			1
this image from the @entity159 satellite shows smoke still rising at 11.30am on september 12 he said his first instinct was to grab a camera - and hours later he would discover a close friend , a pilot at the controls of one of the hijacked planes , was one of the dead			0
like all live tv , the programme had its technical challenges , with @entity138 losing signal from the @entity46 a number of times			2
helping to make sense of what we will be seeing is @entity149 ’s first ever astronaut , major @entity148 , 41 , a former army helicopter pilot who is due to visit the @entity46 for a 6 - month mission next year			1
understandably , @entity179 always keeps a look out for the space station when it passes above him			0
‘ i always get excited when i see the @entity46 , ’ he admitted , ‘ and i even have an app on my phone which gives me an alarm whenever it is getting close ! of course , it ’s a bit different when you ’re going up there yourself			2
’ @entity189 explains what life will be like for him when he does get there			0
the @entity46 ( @entity46 ) , pictured , is constantly hurtling through space at some 17,500mph ( 28,100km/h ) at an altitude of some 250 miles ( 402km ) ‘ the daily working routine is punishing , ’ he said			2
‘ much of the time , we will performing scientific experiments , and then clearing them up			0
’ as well as having to become proficient scientists , the astronauts also have to learn to dock manually visiting vehicles with the @entity46 , go on space walks , and , perhaps most challenging of all , deal with each other during @entity207 ’s six - month mission he will have very little downtime , but when he does , like many of the astronauts , he might head to a seven - window cupola from where the crew can gaze down on the planet they call home			1
‘ although the cupola is meant to be a place that is used for observing @entity22 and controlling robotic arms , ’ said @entity179 , ‘ i know that many use the cupola simply to take in the amazing view			0
’ this may look like a show from the opening credits of @entity224 , but it is in fact an image captured by astronauts onboard the @entity46 as they travelled over @entity229			1

the comments were made during last night ’s @entity11 programme
the show followed astronauts on the @entity46 as they made a lap around @entity22
during a poignant moment , astronaut @entity140 recalled how he saw smoke rising from @entity144 's @entity143 while onboard the @entity46
@entity148 , who will be the first official @entity149 astronaut in space in 2015 , also provided commentary on life in space
