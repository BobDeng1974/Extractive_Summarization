by @entity0 when it comes to race day , @entity1 likes to be organised			2
from what time she awakes , to when she will eat and warm up , no stone is left unturned			2
it ’s not a surprise then to hear that everything - right down to the colour she will dye her trademark technicolour hairstyle - has been planned ahead of her return to the sir @entity12			1
recent preparations have been made at the @entity15 base in @entity16 and an excursion to @entity18 for some outdoor velodrome racing with @entity20			1
going for gold : @entity1 is competing in five events at the @entity23 for @entity24 all bases covered : @entity26 will race both on the track and the road as she looks for glory in @entity31 after being prepared for the impending competition , however , the arena which bears the name of one of @entity36 ’s favourite sons and the most decorated @entity37 ever is reopening its doors - and the 20 - year - old from @entity41 admits that only when she reaches home and dons the @entity36 colours again will she start to realise how far she has come and what she is about to do			1
@entity26 is no longer the unknown running rings around the opposition on grass tracks at the @entity48 , she ’s a reigning @entity49 and @entity51 team pursuit champion who has more than justified her place with the elite @entity54 squad			1
this is a star in the making who , with five chances of striking gold at @entity59 - on the track she will contest the 3,000m individual pursuit , points race and scratch race , whilst she will also hit the streets to tackle the time trial and road race - stands every chance of becoming a national hero			1
an intriguing subplot reveals itself when asking her to assess her medal chances , however			0
as part of her everyday life , @entity26 trains with the rest of @entity15 in @entity16 and that was still the case as recently as last thursday when she was ‘ doing team pursuit training as a @entity15 squad , so that ’s in the background ’			1
familiar faces : @entity26 ( left ) will face @entity49 and @entity51 team pursuit gold medal team - mates @entity20 ( second right ) , who will represent @entity86 , and @entity87 ( second left ) who will represent @entity88 competition : @entity49 and @entity51 team - mates @entity91 ( left ) and @entity87 ( right ) will be @entity26 's rivals her team - mates , such as @entity96 double @entity95 champion @entity91 , and @entity88 flatmate @entity87 , will be the competition			1
‘ i ’ve got to feel good , ’ says @entity26 of the mission which lies ahead			1
‘ with the pursuit , it ’s kind of odd that i ’m training with some of the @entity96 girls and some of the @entity88 girls and we ’re all aware of the splits that everyone is doing			2
‘ i think we ’re kind of ranking each other in our heads - and it ’s close ! i do n’t know which way it ’s going to go and , with the @entity111 and the @entity112 , all we can work off is @entity113			0
it ’s going to be a tight cluster , with some close times			2
‘ because we are all going well , i think it would be a bit awkward and tense if there was a clear disparity between us and it was obvious that someone was getting well beaten , but that ’s not the case			0
‘ it ’s all good competition			2
nobody ’s thinking : “ oh , i ’m way ahead ” and nobody ’s getting angry , thinking : “ oh @entity127 , i ’m really not going well ”			0
it ’s healthy but when we split and we ’re all in our little pens , then i think you ’ll get a few people taking sneaky splits and seeing what other people are doing ! ’ closely - fought : @entity26 is experienced and expects there to be a lot of tough competition in @entity31 that ’s not to suggest @entity26 feels she has anything to fear			1
in fact , she has every intention of embracing any pressure which falls on her young shoulders			0
‘ i do n’t think anyone loves that horrible feeling you get in your stomach , but i see the use of it , ’ she continues			0
‘ i would n’t shy away from people talking about success because obviously i want to win			2
‘ whether that ’s realistic or not , it ’s the attitude you ’ve got to go to the start line with , so it would be fairly hypocritical if i turned round and tried to calm people and say : “ do n’t go saying i ’m going to get medals ”			0
‘ when i was younger , i used to do that with my mum			0
i would tell her to be quiet because she ’d lift you up so that you ’re on top of the world and tell you you ’re amazing and i did n’t deal well with it			0
i think , this time around , if people believe in me then that ’s good			0
patriotic : @entity26 is proud to represent @entity24 and will give her all for her nation in @entity31 ‘ i ’ve got my mum , my dad , my gran and my brother coming ( to the velodrome )			1
i took my dad to a @entity180 once and he got bored and left halfway through , so i ’ m hoping there wo n’t be a repeat ! ’ with such a packed schedule , which encompasses the entirety of the @entity23 , there will be little chance for @entity26 to take stock or dwell on any achievements			1
‘ it ’s not the @entity54 way , i do n’t have time for reflection , ’ she laughs			0
‘ i think we ’re always looking for the next goal and the next target			0
‘ i guess the ultimate reward would be the @entity95 , would n’t it , and the @entity198 will have that same feel to it			2
i think , after this big event , it will be a test of whether i can embrace some success afterwards			0
’ famous face : the track cycling at the @entity23 will take place in the sir @entity12			1

@entity26 will compete in five cycling events for @entity24 in @entity31
@entity26 , @entity91 and @entity87 are reigning world and @entity51 team pursuit champions for @entity15 but they will face each other at the @entity198
the @entity213 will contest the 3,000m individual pursuit , points race , scratch race , as well as the time trail and road race away from the track
sir @entity12 will host track cycling at @entity23
@entity26 expects a tight competition but thinks she can win medals
