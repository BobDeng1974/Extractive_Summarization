by @entity0 published : 13:32 est , 13 january 2014 updated : 14:07 est , 13 january 2014 two cowboy builders conned an elderly customer , charging him twelve times the going rate for botched home improvements			1
@entity7 , 56 , and 59 - year - old @entity8 charged the 76 - year - old man £ 29,800 for painting his house and fitting a window			1
the pair used their powers of persuasion to coax the man into parting with the money from his savings after an elaborate con spanning almost three years			2
@entity7 , left , and @entity8 , right , charged their 76 - year - old victim twelve times the going rate for three years of botched home improvements , including painting and erecting a small fence they pitched up at the man 's house every two to three months , to paint , fit a window or work on the porch			1
during one visit they charged the customer £ 10,000 to paint his fence			1
police were eventually called to inspect their poor workmanship after a tip off from neighbours			0
reputable builders later concluded the bill should have been just £ 2,500 - more than 1,000 per cent below @entity7 and @entity8 ’s asking price			1
at @entity46 the pair , both from @entity44 , each pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud and were each jailed for 12 months			1
@entity48 said the construction con began in june 2009 , when the two men knocked on the front door of the victim in @entity53 , near @entity54			2
they claimed to be builders and agreed a price with the pensioner to carry out work on his house including painting the outside of the house and fencing			0
but unbeknown to the old man he was being overcharged ' ridiculous amounts of money '			0
between july 31 , 2009 and march 21 , 2012 , both men were paid a total of £ 29,800 after they attended the house every two to three months , painting , fitting a window and working on a porch			2
the pair pleaded guilty at @entity46 to conspiracy to defraud and were jailed for 12 months each			1
they were found out when neighbours of their victim noticed he was paying ' ridiculous amounts ' for the work but the alarm was raised by the neighbours when they realised that in march 2012 the victim had raised two cheques for @entity7 and @entity8 , totalling £ 10,000 for work to erect a small fence at his address			1
when the work for the full building project was assessed , the true value of the ' improvements ' was valued at just over £ 2,500			2
both men were then arrested later and charged			0
det con @entity94 said after the case : ' both men preyed on a vulnerable member of our community , knowing that if they could talk their way into his good books , they would be able to con him out of money			0
' for over a period of just under three years , they claimed they were doing work on his house and charging him ridiculous amounts of money			0
' when the “ work ” was looked at by a professional , it was described as substandard at best			0
' thankfully , after an investigation , we were able to bring both men to justice and force them to face up to what they have done			0
