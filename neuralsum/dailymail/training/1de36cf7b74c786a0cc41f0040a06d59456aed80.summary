the staggering scale of @entity2 ’s foreign criminal population is exposed today			1
there are more than 700 murderers and 500 rapists among nearly 12,000 foreign offenders in this country , figures show			1
for the first time , the @entity9 has published a detailed breakdown of the offences and nationality of every criminal from around the world , who is currently on its books having been convicted of offences in this country			1
murderers and rapists alone make up more than one in ten of the total			2
the nationality breakdown shows @entity2 hosts a ‘ @entity36 ’ , with offenders from 177 different countries			1
it shows there are more @entity40 criminals here than any other nationality – a total of 1,026 – or around 2 per cent of the entire @entity40 population in the @entity2			1
second on the list is @entity45 , followed by @entity46 and @entity47			0
the top ten countries alone account for more than 5,500 criminals			2
the figures were uncovered by @entity52 ’s immigration spokesman @entity51 using a question tabled in @entity54			0
he told the @entity55 : ‘ foreign criminals have no place in @entity2 and there is no excuse for ministers not deporting them as early as possible			1
among the group of foreign criminals living in @entity2 there are more than 700 murderers , 500 rapists , 155 child rapists and 228 paedophiles ‘ yet under this government fewer are being removed and it ’s taking longer ; @entity52 has clear plans for making it easier to deport foreign criminals but @entity73 may still wo n’t get a grip and remove people who should n’t be here			1
’ but @entity77 mp @entity76 , a member of the @entity78 said : ‘ the hypocrisy from @entity52 is nauseating			0
it was the previous @entity52 government ’s ramshackle immigration arrangements that facilitated entry of many of these individuals in the first place			0
‘ and the @entity86 created an imbalance in favour of foreign criminals which we are having to correct			2
’ the full list , entitled the @entity93 , includes all 11,719 convicted foreign criminals the @entity9 is managing , whether they are in prison , in immigration detention or at large			1

more than 8,000 offences are listed simply as ‘ other ’			0
