@entity0 was at @entity1 preparing for a difficult trip to defend the @entity3 in @entity4 when the bombshell dropped			1
alerted to an ‘ important ’ @entity7 announcement at 11am , @entity0 was reading official papers – with the television on in the background – when to his horror he realised that @entity12 was defecting			1
such was his party ’s ignorance of the coming earthquake that only yesterday an invitation to party donors was circulated saying : ‘ you ’re invited to a drinks reception and discussion with @entity12 on tuesday september 23 at conservative campaign headquarters			1
despite the shock , @entity0 has only himself and his advisers to blame for not taking @entity7 – and @entity12 – more seriously			1
the @entity26 whips – who impose discipline – had washed their hands of @entity12 , who has rebelled against the government line 62 times since the election			1
now , he has paid them back in kind			0
i have learned that @entity12 has been in constant talks with @entity23 for more than a year , both face to face and regularly on the telephone			1
one of the masterminds behind yesterday 's brilliantly stage - managed political theatre was @entity51 , the former @entity7 treasurer since june , the conversations between the pair have become deadly serious , and were conducted in a private house owned by a wealthy @entity7 supporter			1
worryingly for the prime minister , @entity23 has also held lengthy discussions with a number of other disaffected @entity26 mps			1
another of the masterminds behind yesterday ’s brilliantly stage - managed political theatre was @entity51 , the former @entity7 treasurer			1
the mild - mannered @entity51 , who made a fortune through the spread betting firm @entity63 , gave a record £ 5million donation to the @entity66 shortly before the 2001 election because they were committed to keeping the pound			0
over the past year @entity51 , who lives in the @entity70 in @entity71 , has been quietly holding court with potential @entity26 defectors over lunches in @entity25 ’s @entity75			2
he ’s wined and dined nine mps			0
the lunches are usually in the luxury five - star @entity78 , which is owned by @entity80 – who is a @entity26 donor – or @entity82 , an @entity84 restaurant , which has been a landmark in @entity75 for more than 40 years			2
he entertained @entity12 twice at @entity85 ’s			2
@entity51 , who is 80 next year , was a lifelong @entity26 until he was expelled in 2009 after giving £ 100,000 to @entity7			1
he learnt of his suspension from a journalist , and was bad - mouthed by @entity26 sources as ‘ yesterday ’s man ’			1
another spectacular misjudgment from the party apparatus			0
‘ the nine @entity26 mps were happy to talk to @entity51 because they knew he understood their sense of divided loyalty to the party , ’ says one senior source			1
‘ @entity51 understood what they were going through because he had been on the same journey			0
@entity51 is quietly confident that more may follow @entity12			2
’ the optimism of @entity51 is in contrast to the black mood within @entity104 : put simply , the @entity100 ’s advisers have n’t a clue whether any more will follow			0
in the short term , they have one big problem – and it ’s not one that is easily surmounted , because it ’s the prime minister himself			0
there are at least 50 un-reconstructed @entity0 haters on the backbenches , including euro - sceptics like @entity115 , the mp for @entity116 , who is seen as a potential defector			2
mr @entity12 addresses a press conference in @entity25 after being introduced by the @entity7 leader @entity23 it ’s little secret that @entity123 , who had the whip withdrawn after she went into the jungle with @entity126 ’s i ’m a celebrity ... , has been linked to @entity7 , too			1
they both have safe seats which the @entity66 ca n’t afford to lose			0
dozens more backbenchers feel aggrieved they have been overlooked for promotion , or dismissed from government jobs , or simply ignored			0
‘ @entity0 rarely sets foot in the @entity135 tea room , ’ says one @entity26 mp			1
‘ on the occasions he graces us with his presence , he is flanked by his praetorian guard to protect him			0
the chickens are coming home to roost			0
’ as for 43 - year - old @entity12 , it ’s interesting to note that he has not been subjected to the personal attacks which would usually follow such a devastating betrayal			1
he is popular in the party , with few enemies			0
while many @entity26 mps expect the party to lose the coming by - election , the manner of his going offers them one small but important crumb of comfort			2
it is understood that mr @entity12 was among nine @entity66 wined and dined by millionaire @entity7 donor @entity51 at a series of discreet lunches in @entity75 @entity12 could simply have switched his allegiance and remained as an mp for the rest of this @entity158 at least			1
but he chose to do the decent thing and resign so he can fight for the seat under @entity7 ’s banner			2
his resignation means other @entity148 tempted to follow him will feel obliged to go down the same route			0
how many will be willing to risk losing their seat in a by - election ? perhaps @entity12 had the courage to jump ship because four years ago he romped home in @entity170 with a 12,500 majority			2
a gangly six - footer , he grew up in @entity172 , where his parents worked as doctors			0
his father , @entity175 , a surgeon , diagnosed the first case of @entity177 in @entity178 in the 1980s			0
@entity12 went to @entity179 in @entity172 , then the exclusive @entity180 in @entity181			2
he studied history at the @entity183 and @entity184 , @entity25 , and worked in television and investment banking before politics			0
he finally became mp for @entity188 in 2005 with a narrow majority , but was far more successful when the constituency was redrawn as @entity170 in 2010			0
mr @entity0 was ambushed by the defection of mr @entity12 who quit the party with a parting blast that questioned the prime minister 's policy on @entity197 no one should doubt that @entity12 has physical as well as political courage			1
in january , the hardliner on law and order lived up to his rhetoric when he chased a 29 - year - old shoplifter and pinned him against a wall until the police arrived			0
‘ i collared him literally , ’ he said			2
when the police led the man away in handcuffs , @entity12 tweeted : ‘ police response time pretty effective			1
now off to my advice surgery			0
’ the mp , who has been criticised for billing the taxpayer £ 655 in expenses for a super-sized ‘ love seat ’ , was initially overwhelmed by the heritage of @entity219 when he arrived , but the feeling did n’t last			2
‘ @entity158 is supine , spineless , dominated by spivery and spivs , it does n’t hold the government to account , ’ he said in an interview			1
‘ our primary function is to provide the cheerleader chorus for the frontbench			0
@entity158 is one giant conspiracy against the electorate			2
’ after rejecting the usual blandishments from the party leadership to stop rebelling , such as the hint of ministerial office , he said : ‘ i felt this incredible sense of liberation when i realised that i was n’t going to play the game			0
’ thoughtful and intellectual , his defection is all the harder to dismiss by the @entity241			0
@entity12 is one of a growing number of @entity26 mps and ministers who doubt the pm ’s ability to claw back powers from @entity247 ahead of a 2017 referendum on whether should @entity249 should stay in the @entity250			1
last summer , the @entity252 ’s review into the extent of @entity247 ’ influence – as part of @entity0 ’s supposed renegotiation – reported back that the relationship between @entity249 and the @entity250 was broadly fine			1
@entity12 ’s response was characteristically blunt : ‘ @entity260 elite says @entity250 membership is a good thing – shock			1
’ if the prime minister now wants to stop more defections , he will have to spell out for the first time that like @entity23 he , too , could lead @entity249 out of the @entity250 – and he will have to say it like he means it .			0

@entity12 resigned from the @entity26 and @entity158
he said @entity0 was ' not serious about changes country needed '
@entity7 once derided by @entity0 as ‘ fruitcakes , loonies and closet racists ’
