take a look at these two photos			2
can you see any difference between them ? a little , but not too much ? good , that is exactly how it should be			2
the pictures were taken a week apart — i think you ’ll agree that in the second one , i look a little sharper , fresher , more alive			2
nothing too revolutionary or extreme , though			2
in fact , most people have assumed i ’ve just had a really lovely , relaxing @entity15 break			2
which is precisely what i intended			2
it ’s said to be the most furtive , discreet and effective facelift of all			2
my surgeon , dr @entity38 , trained @entity23 , along with hundreds of other medics , in how to perform the @entity41 lift , in which fine threads with tiny cones along the length of them are sewn into the face , beneath the subcutaneous layer of fat , with a needle , then pulled tight , gently lifting sagging skin			1
as it takes just half - an - hour and there is no recovery time , the procedure , which is available at clinics the length and breadth of the country for around £ 1,200 , could be — and frequently is — performed during a lunch break , leaving colleagues none the wiser			1
after : @entity19 , 46 , ( pictured ) underwent the half hour procedure , which has no recovery time , and was thrilled with the results in fact , if you decided to greet inevitable comments like ‘ gosh , you look well ’ and ‘ you must tell me which foundation you use ’ with a knowing smile , no one need ever know you ’d succumbed to a secret moment of vanity			1
while i ’m all for gilding the lily ( i never leave home without a good smearing of make - up and regularly have my grey hair highlighted ) , i never imagined i would go so far as to have foreign bodies inserted in my face in my quest for eternal youth			1
but i became far more receptive to the idea a few months ago when , aged 46 , i was shown an alarmingly jowly profile photograph of myself , taken by my ten - year - old daughter @entity85			1
i ’d not seen myself in profile for some time and struggled with the harsh truth : my face , like the rest of me , was heading south			1
dr @entity90 ( left ) and dr @entity34 ( right ) performed the threadlift procedure on @entity19 at @entity23 winner 's clinic in @entity24 shortly afterwards , while washing up , i caught sight of my reflection in the kitchen window and recoiled in shock , actually believing i ’d seen a vision of my mother , who died six years ago aged 82			1
a more public low - point followed one evening when , on my way home from work , a woman in her 30s stood up to offer me her seat on the @entity107			1
not so long ago , that act of kindness would have propelled me on to a crash diet , convinced she thought i looked pregnant			2
but it was so much worse to have to face up to simply looking old			2
going under the scalpel was out of the question			0
apart from the huge expense and weeks of recovery , as the mother of three children — aged 13 , ten and six — i could n’t justify risking a general anaesthetic unless it was absolutely necessary			1
effects of the treatment are meant to last around 18 months , at which point the threads and cones biodegrade and are absorbed into the body so , the @entity127 , done using a local anaesthetic , sounded like the perfect solution			1
better still , the results promised to be subtle and discreet , so there was no danger of me looking like @entity133 — infamous as the @entity134 after extreme plastic surgery wrecked her face			0
while threadlifts have for years been the beauty treatment of choice for the rich and famous — @entity140 is understood to be among them — who want to rejuvenate without looking like they ’ve been through a wind tunnel , what ’s new about the @entity41 technique are its ‘ bi-directional cones ’			1
with the procedure ’s previous incarnation , the cones only pointed downwards , embedding themselves into the facial tissue to keep the thread in place , and at the same time causing inflammation beneath the skin to stimulate production of collagen , the protein that provides scaffolding for the face			1
the needle and thread are pushed upwards beneath the skin to the exit point near the hairline , the thread was pulled taut at both ends , so that the cones nudge the facial tissues northwards but these new threads ( developed in the @entity171 and introduced here last year ) are dotted with cones pointing up and down			0
as well as stimulating collagen production , the upward ones push into facial tissue , making skin tauter and giving more of a lift			0
effects are meant to last around 18 months , at which point the threads and cones — which contain polylactic acid , the biologically - compatible substance used in suture threads and orthopaedic pins — biodegrade and are absorbed into the body			1
and so i made an appointment with dr @entity38 at dr @entity23 ’s clinic , in @entity192 , @entity24			1
the ten local anaesthetic injections into each side of my face were , i was relieved to discover , the worst part of the whole procedure			0
red dots were drawn to indicate where the threads would go in and out of my face			0
then , as i lay on the bed , covered in sterile paper , i could vaguely feel the surgeon , assisted by dr @entity23 , injecting a needle — to which the 30cm thread and cones were attached — into the centre of my cheek			1
once both the threads have been place in one side of the face , the doctor turns to the other side to create the same lift in the second cheek - @entity19 is pictured here during the procedure it travelled 5mm from the top layer of skin ( the epidermis ) through the dermis , the subcutaneous tissue , the collagen and stopped just past the fibroblasts ( the skin cells that make connective tissues )			1
the needle and thread were pushed upwards beneath my skin to the exit point near my hairline , which was pricked with another needle to make a hole for the needle and thread to come through			0
the thread was pulled taut at both ends , so that the downward - pointing cones embedded into the subcutaneous fat and the upward cones nudged the facial tissues northwards			1
a second thread was inserted in the same way , further up my face , close to my cheekbones , and pulled upwards then downwards , until it was taut and embedded			0
as with many medical processes there was some blood visible at the end of the process and some had even run into @entity19 's hair with both of the threads in place on my right side , the doctor turned to creating the same lift on my left cheek			1
the whole process took just 30 minutes , though it felt far longer — despite my efforts not to dwell on what was happening			0
inevitably , there was some blood and , when the surgeon handed me a mirror , i was taken aback to see some had run into my hair			0
back home , the children could n’t see past the blood , and begged for the gory details			0
but my husband — a hardened doubter of cosmetic surgery — was astounded			0
@entity19 is pictured here after the procedure , her kids were keen to know the gory details , while her husband was astounded by the results he even compared my new face to a picture that hangs on our landing , in which i ’m holding @entity281 as a baby ten years ago			0
i could n’t have hoped for a lovelier comment			0
in the days afterwards , i was told to keep the incision points clean , dry and infection - free : showers were out , as was make - up			1
also banned were saunas , contact sport and dental surgery , while the tissue around the cones healed			0
i was also ordered to sleep on my back for five nights — the biggest problem of all			0
even without make - up , i could see i looked much better : like a fresher , less exhausted version of myself			1
and because the reflection staring back at me appeared less tired , i felt like i had more energy			0
@entity19 , pictured after the treatment , was thrilled with the results and can see that even without make - up she looks like a ' fresher , less exhausted version ' of herself the following saturday , i met up with my friend @entity305 , who i ’ve known since playgroup			1
i had n’t told her about my threadlift and her first reaction on seeing me was : ‘ wow , you look great ! sooo well			0
’ my sister , @entity310 , an advanced nurse practitioner who administers @entity311 and fillers , is also thinking about training to do threadlifts , after seeing my results on @entity316			2
‘ it ’s knocked a decade off you ! ’ she said			0
‘ yet your face still looks natural — just plumper and less lined			0
’ that plumping effect should be even more noticeable over the next few months as more collagen is produced , thanks to stimulation from the cones			0
but will i tell anyone what i ’ve had done next time they ask ? probably not			2
this is my little secret			0
