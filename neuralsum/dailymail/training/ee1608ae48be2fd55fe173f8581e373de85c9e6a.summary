by @entity0 published : 20:22 est , 14 november 2013 updated : 05:03 est , 15 november 2013 plans for a multi-million pound ‘ space port ’ in @entity4 were yesterday enthusiastically backed by the science minister @entity5			1
he hailed the ‘ very exciting ambition ’ to construct a mini @entity4 @entity8 as a launching base for space tourists and satellites into orbit within five years			1
possible locations are already being considered in the @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 , with the plan for around one mission blasting off a month			1
future : a space port similar to @entity8 in @entity20 could be built in @entity4 the portal , which would cost hundreds of millions of pounds , would be entirely privately funded but the government would be required to change existing regulations because of the dangers of space travel			1
mr @entity26 said he hoped it could provide a @entity29 hub for sir @entity30 to base his @entity32 space tourism programme which intends to take passengers on suborbital joyrides for around £ 200,000 a time			1
he said : ‘ the space portal is a very exciting ambition			1
‘ it ’s very important that @entity4 is a driving force for the growth area of low cost space travel			1
’ he said possible locations included a former @entity43 base in @entity16 or a site nearer to a commercial centre			1
@entity46 , chairman of the @entity47 said if built it would be near a coastal area			0
plans : the new port could provide a @entity29 hub for sir @entity30 to base his @entity32 space tourism programme he said : ‘ for a space portal you need to be beside a long body of open water where you ca n’t annoy anybody			1
‘ you do n’t want to be launching over land			1
it ’s much safer and better for people to running out to the sea			0
‘ what we are asking the government is not to fund the space portal but to set a regulatory regime that allows it to be delivered			2
’ ‘ if you ’ve got crafts going up into space they need to be coordinated with the @entity72 and everything else that ’s going on in our already crowded air space			2
‘ you definitely need to be prepared for a higher risk profile than you have in civil aviation			0
‘ when you go up into space things can sometimes go wrong			2
’ he added : ‘ it ’s important to understand that the space portal is not just for people going for jaunts into space			2
‘ it would enable us to put up a range of satellites which would make it easier for us to expand broadband coverage , for example			0
optimism : mr @entity26 said the proposals were a ' very exciting ambition ' ‘ these sort of things could be resolved by low cost access to space			2
’ ‘ there are groups of people debating the possible location			0
‘ the belief is there is a commercial opportunity			0
we believe 2018 is feasible			0
’ he spoke at the central @entity111 launch of the @entity4 @entity112 , which warned : ‘ access to space is a barrier to growth for @entity4 companies as well as a commercial opportunity			2
‘ the ability of @entity4 companies to secure timely launch slots is degreasing and launch costs are increasing ... ‘ the @entity4 must take action now if it wishes to host commercial space flight			0
’ the @entity124 , @entity72 and two government departments are currently researching plans for safe commercial plane operations in the @entity4 , and are due to report next summer			0
tycoon sir @entity30 revealed last month that his @entity32 division has already sold 700 tickets for people to travel into space			1
he said the venture was ‘ within a matter of months ’ of being able to launch			0
his rockets will be built like an airplane and should one day be able to travel to @entity139 in a couple of hours			0
only 500 people have ever been to space but sir @entity30 said he will put the same number up in the first year			1
celebrities including @entity145 and @entity146 are among those said to have signed up .			0

locations are also being considered in the @entity14 and @entity16
would be the launching base for space tourism programmes
plans enthusiastically backed by science minister @entity5
could become the home of @entity30 *'s* @entity32 programme
