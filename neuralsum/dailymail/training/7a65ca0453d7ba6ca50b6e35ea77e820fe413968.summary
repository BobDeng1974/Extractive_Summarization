by @entity0 for @entity1 thousands of migrants working in the @entity3 as cleaners , labourers or bar staff would have to pay tax for the first time , under @entity10 proposals			1
all those who work in the @entity3 currently receive the first £ 10,000 of their income tax - free , which has meant the lowest earners pay no tax at all			1
but under plans drawn up by @entity22 ’s department , migrant workers who are not full - time residents in this country would be stripped of this ‘ generous ’ allowance and pay 20 per cent tax on all of their income			1
the policy could save the exchequer £ 400million a year , and is expected to put some migrants off coming to the @entity3			2
there are up to 250,000 @entity35 migrants working temporarily in this country , and the rule would apply only to those who live here for less than six months a year			0
but some 175,000 @entity3 expatriates who have an income from homes they rent out in the @entity3 would also lose their tax - free allowance under the plans			1
it would also affect some 100,000 high - earning international professionals who spend part of the year working in @entity3 – but they would be able to claim a tax credit in their home country			2
tightening : @entity22 claims the measures will bring the @entity3 in line with @entity36 , @entity37 , the @entity38 and @entity39 , which only offer perks to residents the consultation says that there is a case for migrants on very low incomes to be allowed a tax - free sum , but that a threshold would be very difficult to implement and would create a ‘ cliff edge ’ beyond which tax would suddenly increase significantly			1
tax experts said the move would also create more administration for employers of temporary migrants as they are likely to have to place them on the payroll for the first time			0
the plans to deny the personal allowance to people who are non-resident for tax purposes were first revealed in the @entity85 in march , but more details of the options were released yesterday			0
it follows a series of comments from @entity91 about the need to clamp down on benefits for migrants			0
under plans announced last month , migrants will not be entitled to claim @entity97 until they have made six months of national insurance contributions – up from three months currently			0
at present , an @entity100 migrant in @entity3 temporarily working 40 hours a week at the minimum wage would earn £ 6,760 in six months , and keep it all under the personal tax allowance			2
withdrawing the personal allowance , and imposing tax at 20 per cent would cut those earnings by £ 1,352			0
a @entity10 spokesman said : ‘ the increases the government has made to the personal allowance support hardworking people by helping them to keep more of the money they earn and , as a result , is one of the most generous in the world			0
‘ at the same time , we believe that it is reasonable to consider whether non-residents who receive income from the @entity3 are paying a fair share of tax on that income , in this country			1
‘ the government is seeking views on whether it would be appropriate to restrict the personal allowance to those resident in the @entity3 , or people who have most of their economic connections in the @entity3 , as is the case in many other countries including most of the @entity100			2

all @entity3 workers currently receive first £ 10,000 of their income tax - free
@entity22 has proposed plans to strip migrants of the perk
claims it will bring the @entity3 in line with countries like @entity39 and @entity36
