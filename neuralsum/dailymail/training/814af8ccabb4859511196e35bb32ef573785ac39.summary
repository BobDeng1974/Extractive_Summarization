the fanatic is one of seven men released from @entity12 anti-terror control orders this month under rules meant to protect their human rights			1
he undertook terror training in @entity17 and was named as an alleged terrorist by an @entity20 supergrass whose evidence helped to foil a massive @entity5 bomb plot			1

ministers say identifying men who have been subject to @entity61 and @entity62 ( @entity63 ) would breach their human rights by compromising their privacy or safety			1
there is mounting alarm at extremists ’ use of anti-terror legislation to hide their identities			0
under @entity77 legislation , the blanket of secrecy is granted as a matter of course following a simple application by the men ’s lawyers			0
it is lifted only if they go on the run			0
mps called for the ban on naming the suspects to end			0
@entity89 , chairman of the @entity91 home affairs select committee , said : ‘ the lack of monitoring of those originally on @entity63 should be a real worry to the @entity5 public			2
’ @entity48 , who was born in @entity5 , was first put on a control order in 2009 for allegedly being involved in terrorist activity			1
he was switched to a @entity102 in 2012 when control orders were abolished			1
in 2011 , the @entity104 heard he was suspected of having explosives training between 2001 and 2004 and being in contact with a senior @entity3 leader in @entity17			2
@entity48 was also accused of helping to transfer funds to @entity17 for terrorist purposes and was part of a group in @entity26 that was ‘ involved in promoting terrorism ’			1
also linked to the group was a member of the terror cell arrested under @entity116 in 2004 – which foiled a huge plot to use fertiliser bombs to target @entity26 ’s @entity31 nightclub and @entity33 shopping centre in @entity122			1
the @entity31 nightclub was also targeted five men were jailed in 2007 , including @entity126 - based @entity125 , who was later revealed to have links to @entity128 , a ringleader in the 7/7 @entity26 bombings			1
a crucial witness in the @entity116 trial was @entity132 , an @entity20 who turned supergrass			2
following his arrest in 2004 , @entity132 conducted a series of @entity138 interviews in which he named other alleged extremists , including @entity48			2

until this month , eight fanatics were subject to @entity102 restrictions on their movements – which can include strict curfews			0
but under rules demanded by @entity152 , seven of the orders have either already lapsed or will do so by the end of the month			2
the newly - free men also include an extremist known as cd who attended a terror training camp in @entity160 with four of the attempted suicide bombers involved in the july 21 2005 attacks			2

but security minister @entity169 said : ‘ the police and security service believe t - pims have been effective in reducing the national security risk			0
