1 @entity0 @entity4 decided that the voice of his boss in his ear was not worth following			1
team orders ? no , thank you , i have a world championship to win			1
it was the @entity25 driver ’s defiance in the face of an instruction to let through @entity6 , his @entity5 team - mate and only rival for the title , that dominated talk here in the paddock long after @entity0 ’s win in a topsy - turvy @entity37 @entity36 of sliding and safety cars had parked up for the night			1
the order came three - quarters of the way into the race during the eight laps in which @entity6 , who was on a different strategy , was about a second behind @entity4			1
@entity6 , who was informed that the team had decided @entity4 should give way , twice asked why his team - mate had not done so			1
twice more @entity4 was asked to allow @entity6 in front			1
again and again he disobliged the pit @entity50 was an act of regrettable insubordination , one that took the gloss off a wonderful recovery drive that took @entity4 , whose car burst into flames in qualifying , from a pit - lane start to a third - place finish			1
he may even have denied them victory , through @entity6			2
that was the view of @entity5 director @entity77 , who said : ‘ if @entity4 had let @entity6 go , @entity6 could have won the race			1
’ instead he finished fourth			0
@entity4 sadly failed to emulate @entity6 ’s good behaviour towards him in two races last season when he respectively held position and gave way in the @entity85 and @entity86 grands prix			1
admittedly , there was less at stake then			0
given that team orders are permitted in the rules , they should be followed			2
otherwise , why have them ? that is the case against @entity4			2
and it is unarguable – to some degree			0
@entity4 , however , could cite mitigation			2
@entity6 was never exactly on his gearbox , and it would have taken a big gulp to hand over his place			2
spin : @entity4 left the track at @entity103 of the first lap at the @entity105 but was able to continue carrying on : @entity4 told his @entity5 colleagues that his front left wheel struck the wall but was able to return to the track coming through the field : @entity4 stormed on to the podium after starting from the pit lane as @entity4 argued afterwards , he was in ‘ the same race ’ as @entity6 , the man who led him by 14 points at the start of the afternoon but only 11 at the end			1
@entity4 added that he was ' very , very shocked ’ by the instruction , while @entity6 , who is an even - keeled non-controversialist , said he would not comment publicly on the situation until he had discussed the matter with the team			1
@entity4 was supported by the ever - loyal @entity122 , the executive chairman of @entity5 , who said : ‘ i feel it is a racer and i would have done exactly the same thing			1
he was just defending his position			0
‘ @entity6 was too far away			2
@entity128 ( @entity127 , the technical director who relayed the instruction to @entity130 via his race engineer @entity131 ) saw this and he stopped telling the engineers to slow @entity4 down			1
he told them just to race			0
’ leading the way : @entity6 , who started the race on pole , leads @entity1 's @entity10 into the first corner in wet conditions in @entity139 treacherous : the wet weather in @entity37 played havoc with the team 's strategies in the early stages of the race the team were doing their best to protect @entity130 – as they always do – and smooth over the searching questions the controversy prompted			1
can anyone control @entity4 ? seemingly not given that @entity77 said there would be ‘ no ramifications ’ for this act of disobedience			2
‘ i do n’t want to play the vicious general and demand that they obey the rules , ’ said @entity77 , somewhat benevolently			0
‘ @entity128 or i could have gone on the radio , but we did n’t			0
’ that means @entity4 can blithely do as he pleases			2
wreck : @entity161 driver @entity160 climbs out of his mangled car after crashing into the wall on the final corner setting the pace : @entity6 leads @entity11 and @entity10 into the second corner at the @entity105 inches : @entity3 's @entity2 gets close to the rear end of @entity10 's @entity1 it is at crisis moments such as these that the calming , experienced presence of @entity172 , the super strategist who left @entity5 last season , is missed			1
would @entity4 have defied him over the radio ? less chance			2
@entity77 said at the start of the season that he was confident the word of @entity127 and himself would be writ			0
it was embarrassingly exposed not to be so by this incident			0
@entity77 , admitting he was now in corporate mode , tried to defuse the situation , saying : ‘ that was such a difficult race with so many difficult decisions that needed to be made , quick decisions			0
we need to analyse how we ended up there and whether from here we need to discuss the racing between the two			0
‘ it is getting intense and it is clear that they are direct competitors for the world championship			0
we need to sit down and discuss it			0
delay : the safety car leads @entity2 and the rest of the field on lap 23 of the race faithful : fans get behind the @entity3 team in the grandstands at the circuit in @entity37 nice view : @entity206 hostesses take selfies against the backdrop of the @entity36 at the start of the season the team drew up a long list detailing how they and each driver would respond in any given situation , but that is no longer relevant given the developing dynamics of the championship : a deep internal duel among the drivers and a constructors ' championship practically won			1
‘ maybe that ( blueprint ) does n’t function anymore , ’ said @entity77			0
‘ we can not ask either driver to give up positions or jeopardise their own championship chances for the benefit of the team			1
’ away from this dispute , there was a fantastic race			0
not least by @entity4 , who scythed his way up the field			2
‘ once the green light came i was just in hunting mode , ’ he said			0
he made a particularly daring move stick , passing @entity12 ’s @entity13 on the outside of a left - handed turn			0
shunt : @entity239 ended up in the barriers after losing control of his @entity242 on the exit of @entity244 before the wet conditions dried out , the safety car was out twice , which helped @entity4 as the field concertinaed			0
congratulations to @entity0 , who put his @entity1 past @entity2 ’s @entity3 in the dying moments of the race			0
at this stage @entity6 was close on @entity4 ’s heels			1
he asked no quarter and he was given none			0
lap 1 : @entity4 passes @entity254 as they leave the pits , but he spins moments later at @entity103			1
he nudges the barrier but survives without any damage to his @entity5 and re-joins the @entity259 4 : @entity4 overtakes @entity239 and then the @entity15 of @entity254 to move up to @entity260 : he then passes pastor @entity261 , @entity262 and @entity263 on one lap to be @entity265 7 : it ’s @entity267 up next , and the @entity268 dispatches of the @entity270 driver with @entity271 8 : @entity4 then sails past the @entity3 of @entity9 on the pit straight for 13th having already overtaken @entity273 14 : four places gained for @entity4 after the safety car period sees the @entity268 move up to @entity276 : three laps later , and the charging @entity5 driver is up to @entity279 : @entity4 is now fifth after @entity0 and @entity280 34 : it ’s 2nd for @entity4 after a sumptuous move on @entity12 , @entity6 ’s pit - stop and @entity10 ’s wild @entity284 39 : @entity4 incredibly leads the race following @entity2 ’s pit @entity286 40 : the @entity268 then comes in for a change of tyres , but a sluggish pit stop sees him re-join in @entity290 : @entity4 ignores a team instruction to let @entity6 , on a different strategy to the @entity268 , @entity293 55 : @entity4 is back up to 2nd after @entity0 , @entity9 and @entity280 67 : @entity0 passes @entity4 with three laps remaining and he holds on to the final podium spot despite a late onslaught from title rival @entity6			1

@entity62 driver takes second win of the season ahead of @entity2 and @entity4
@entity4 ignored @entity5 orders to let team - mate and championship rival @entity6 pass on lap 51
@entity6 was over a second behind and @entity4 was ' very shocked ' at the instruction
the @entity268 started in the pit lane and spun on lap one but fought back to hold off @entity6
he is now 11 points behind @entity6 in standings with eight races left
@entity6 off the podium for first time this season , while @entity2 secured best result in 10 months
