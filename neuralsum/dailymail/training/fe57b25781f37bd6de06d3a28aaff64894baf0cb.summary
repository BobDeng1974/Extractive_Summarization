' from seven years old , from day one of the abuse , @entity2 told me that we loved each other and this was love , this was an expression of our love			2
and then he would follow it up with ' but if you ever tell anyone what we are doing both of our lives and careers would be over '			0
' ' this is not a case of repressed memory			0
i have never forgotten one moment of what @entity2 did to me , but i was psychologically and emotionally completely unable and unwilling to understand that it was sexual abuse			2

' i 'm a father and i became a father two and a half years ago to this beautiful baby boy and during the first 18 months of his life i collapsed into two nervous breakdowns , terrifying nervous breakdowns , ' he said			0

in a statement @entity165 said : ' this is a young man who has testified at least twice under oath over the past 20 years and said in numerous interviews that @entity2 never did anything inappropriate to him or with him			2
' now , nearly four years after @entity2 has passed , this sad and less - than - credible claim has been made			2
@entity0 said the ordeal of launching such a public case was too great for it to be about money			0
' the idea that i would make all of this up and put myself , my wife , my son , my entire family through this extremely stressful and painful experience all for money is incomprehensible , ' he said			0
' i 've lived in silence and denial for 22 years and i ca n't spend another moment in that ... i 'm never going to go away with this for the sake of money			2
i 'm never going to be silenced for money			0

' but he said he was never offered money to deny the abuse during the trial			0
' there was no money , there was no " you must lie			0
" @entity2 , when he would talk to me before these things were going on , and he would call me everyday ... it was complete manipulation and brainwashing			0
it was n't any sense of the truth on the phone , he would role play with me and train me for these scenarios			0

@entity0 , 30 , is *mounting* a civil lawsuit against the dead star 's estate claiming he suffered years of abuse
