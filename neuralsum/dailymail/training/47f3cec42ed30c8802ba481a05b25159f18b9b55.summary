most wanted : @entity2 bomb maker @entity0 , who is described by a @entity4 official as ' an evil genius ' the hunt is on to find @entity8 's ' evil genius ' - an explosives expert believed to be behind a terrifying plot to target trans - @entity12 flights using human bombs			1
@entity0 , who has survived numerous assassination attempts , is understood to have perfected a device which can be sewn into a human body making it almost impossible to detect by airport security scanners			1
the 32 - year - old is believed to have led a team of bomb makers based in @entity23 which has already produced several of the devices after linking up with extremists fighting in @entity26			1
the technology is already thought to have reached @entity29 jihadists in @entity26 and @entity30			2
it is now feared they will return to target flights leaving the @entity29			2
in response , security at airports across the world is being stepped up after @entity4 counter-terror chiefs received what they described as a ' credible ' terror threat			1
in april this year @entity0 survived a @entity4 special forces ambush in southern @entity23 , when a 4x4 he was believed to be travelling in was targetted in a drone strike and ground assault			1
security expert @entity44 yesterday described @entity0 as @entity8 's ‘ number one bomb maker			1
’ he said : ‘ security experts are worried that there has been more bomb training in some of the terror cells across the @entity50 ‘ the technology for bomb making is better than it was ten years ago			2
that makes it easier to share the information			2
‘ it could be using a chemical that the scanner does n't recognise , at a chemical level			2
‘ we 're talking about objects that are made from innocuous materials , chemicals that slip under the radar			2
‘ think of it as a way to confuse the technology in scanners			2
it could be the substances in a printer cartridge			1
‘ with all the warnings about @entity0 , it means airport security teams have to be a lot more vigilant			1
‘ as we know there 's a lot of linkage between @entity8 and this man			2
he 's a constant threat			2
he 's their number one bomb maker			2
‘ they have been after him for years			2
it 's believed he has been training other members of @entity8 to create devices			1
he operates across @entity23 and the @entity50			0
’ in response to the threat , security was being ramped up at airports across @entity29			0
passengers at @entity92 were being asked to switch on laptops and mobile phones to prove they were functioning properly			0
in addition , electronic equipment , clothing and shoes were being swabbed to test for traces of explosives and the number of sophisticated body scanners at @entity29 airports has been raised from ten to 21			0
at @entity105 , extra machines were sent to departure gates on transatlantic flights to allow staff to swab hand luggage at boarding as well as at security			0
electronic devices and footwear are being subjected to greater scrutiny			2
the measures are likely to lead to delays during the summer holidays when @entity92 alone has 200,000 passengers a day			0
@entity29 prime minister @entity118 insisted yesterday that safety comes first			0
he said : ' this is something we ’ve discussed with the @entity4 and what we have done is put in place some extra precautions and extra checks			1
‘ the safety of the travelling public must come first			0
we must not take any risks with that			0
i hope this wo n’t lead to unnecessary delays but it ’s very important that we always put safety first			0
’ airports last night insisted planes would not be delayed – but passengers may have to arrive at gates earlier to go through the new procedures			0
security has been stepped up across airports in @entity29 with new state - of - the - art scanning equipment being brought in and passengers being warned to expect delays @entity0 's sinister creations have also been used on two high - profile terror attempts in the @entity4 , including the underwear bomb carried by @entity145 @entity144 in his attempt to blow up a plane carrying 300 passengers over @entity4 on christmas day 2009 ' it has also been suggested that ‘ sky marshals ’ – undercover armed police – could be brought in on some routes			1
' deputy prime minister @entity153 warned that the new checks were unlikely to be ‘ a one - off , temporary thing ’			0
he said : ‘ this is the world we now live in			0
‘ i do n’t want people to think that this is some sort of blip for a week			0
' this is part of an evolving and constant review about whether the checks in our airports - and indeed other places of entry and exits from countries - keep up with what we know from intelligence and other sources about the nature of the threats we face			0
’ @entity0 's bombs are of particular concern as they contain no metal elements , meaning they are virtually undetectable and can evade airport security			1
incredibly he carried out one test using his willing younger brother , @entity180 , who had a bomb implanted in his body for an assassination attempt on a @entity2 prince			1
although the device went off as planned , @entity180 succeeded in killing only himself and not his target			1
@entity0 ’s sinister creations have also been used on two high - profile terror attempts in the @entity4 , including the underwear bomb carried by @entity145 @entity144 in his attempt to blow up a plane carrying 300 passengers over @entity4 on christmas day 2009			1
in 2010 , his devices were found in printer cartridges on a cargo plane bound for the @entity4			1
they were intercepted in the @entity29			0
in may 2012 , @entity4 officials said they believed @entity0 had built an improved version of the underwear bomb , which was given to a @entity2 - recruited double agent to blow up on a @entity4 - bound flight			1
after the discovery of the printer cartridge bomb , then @entity4 deputy national security adviser @entity202 said analysis of the devices showed they were made by the same person who was behind the underwear bomb			1
in may 2012 , @entity4 officials said they believed @entity0 had built an improved version of the underwear bomb ( pictured ) , which was given to a @entity2 - recruited double agent to blow up on a @entity4 - bound flight he said : ‘ he ’s a very dangerous individual – clearly somebody who has a fair amount of training and experience			1
we need to find him and bring him to justice as soon as we can			0
’ @entity4 congressman and former homeland security committee chairman @entity218 said @entity0 was an ‘ evil genius ’ , adding : ‘ he is constantly expanding , he is constantly adjusting			1
’ intelligence sources believe @entity0 , who is known as @entity223 , has been passing on his lethal bomb - making expertise from his base in @entity23 to @entity26 , with plans to attack transatlantic flights			1
he is also feared to be training @entity29 fanatics in @entity23 , where @entity230 and @entity231 believe extremists pose a real threat to the @entity29			0
all his bombs use a chemical fuse and a high - level industrial explosive known as @entity237 , or pentaerythritol tetranitrate			0
the same material was used in 2001 by @entity29 shoe bomber @entity240 when he tried to destroy a transatlantic flight			0
@entity242 , a @entity4 expert in defence and homeland security , said the authorities were worried about bombs implanted inside people or explosives made from non-metallic elements			1
but he said it was important to remember that previous attempts to blow up planes had failed			0
‘ these guys are serial failures , ’ he added			0
‘ it ’s not like they have a track record of unmitigated success			0
it ’s closer to the opposite			0
’ they surfaced in @entity23 in 2009 , where it emerged they had joined the newly - formed @entity265			0
in august of that year , @entity180 pretended to be an @entity267 militant who wanted to reform , and was given an audience with prince @entity269 , @entity2 ’s top counter-terrorism official			1
once stood next to the royal , he detonated the bomb , hidden inside part of his intestine			0
but the blast went straight downwards meaning @entity180 was torn in two and the prince escaped with minor injuries			1
@entity0 was named as one of @entity2 ’s most wanted terrorists in 2009 and in 2011 joined the @entity4 wanted list .			1

@entity0 was born into *respectable* *middle* class @entity2 family
he first tried out *chilling* *tactics* on willing younger brother , @entity180
in 2010 , his devices were found in printer cartridges on @entity4 bound plane
