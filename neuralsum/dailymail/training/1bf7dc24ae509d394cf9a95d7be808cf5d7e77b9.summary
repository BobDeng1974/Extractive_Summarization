@entity0 will have all their attacking talent for the second half of the season after @entity5 and @entity6 's agents confirmed they would not leave the club and photographic evidence emerged signalling @entity10 's imminent return			1
@entity10 has not played for the club since the 3 - 0 defeat of @entity12 in august but looks finally ready to return to a forward line that has wilted in his absence			1
team - mate @entity16 posted a photo of the former @entity19 striker online , and said : ' good to see this man back ! ' @entity16 posted a photo online with @entity10 , who is returning from a spell on the sidelines @entity10 's last game for @entity0 came in their 3 - 0 defeat of @entity12 in august 2014 without @entity26 , who was given a short break by manager @entity28 , @entity6 was preferred to his fellow countryman @entity5 in saturday 's victory at @entity31 but neither are likely to feature prominently in the remainder of the season			1
however , despite both being linked with moves back to @entity37 the agents of @entity5 and @entity6 insist that will not happen			1
' [ @entity5 ] has a contract with @entity0 and ca n't really be offered to other clubs , ' agent @entity39 told @entity42			1
' he chose to leave @entity37 and was aware of what he was leaving ; he has n't had the success he was hoping for , but he still needs time			2
' @entity45 have denied their interest in him , and i have had absolutely no contact with @entity49 ( @entity50 ) , so that 's the current situation now			2
' the @entity52 forward poses for a photo with @entity0 captain @entity54 @entity28 started @entity6 up front against @entity31 after sending @entity26 on holiday @entity6 's representative @entity57 has also denied his player will be leaving @entity59			1
' @entity6 will not return to @entity37 in january , ' he told @entity60			1
' he is happy with @entity0 , the club he is playing for			2

his injury list is easing with defender @entity70 set to return soon having not featured since the end of last season because of a knee injury			2
the 22 - year - old , who has been used on both the left and right side of defence by @entity28 , is out of contract in the summer and increased competition in those areas - @entity81 and @entity82 both arrived last summer - presents a challenge for him in the next couple of months			0
@entity5 came on as a second half substitute against @entity31 at the @entity86 @entity5 will not return to @entity37 in january , according to the forward 's agent ' when i saw that we signed two full - backs , i immediately thought ' i need to up my game now ' , ' he told the @entity93			1
' i know i need to consistently do well if i 'm to get in the team and then stay there			0
' i want to keep developing as a footballer , that 's why not being available has been so frustrating , but competition for places does n't bother me			0
i 'm always up for the fight			0
' i 've been out for what has felt like a really long time			0
i 've got in the team before and kept my place			0
now i need to do that again			0
