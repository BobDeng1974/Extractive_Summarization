' @entity14 want to fund the department but oppose @entity4 amendments stripping funding from @entity11 's 2012 and 2014 executive orders lifting a deportation threat for millions of illegal immigrants			1
the @entity2 legislation passed by the @entity4 put @entity35 @entity2 in a tough position because not only do they lack the votes to prevent @entity11 's fellow @entity14 from using procedural hurdles to block the bill but also some @entity2 senators have expressed misgivings about tying homeland security funding to the immigation issue			1
' @entity4 has acted to de-fund the department and to stop the president 's overreach when it comes to immigration and his executive orders , ' @entity0 said			2

' ' to now blame @entity14 when members of his own party , conservative leaders and others have all asked him to back off this game of chicken is disingenuous at best			0
' if @entity0 sticks to his guns ' as he did in 2013 , ' @entity34 predicted , ' he will be responsible for shutting down a large part of the government , the @entity1 people will perceive it that way , and his party and the country will suffer for it			1

' the speaker 's reliance on talking points and finger - pointing was a sad reflection of the fact that ( the ) @entity118 continues to hold the gavel as they insist on their futile anti-immigrant grandstanding			0

@entity14 insist on a ' clean ' funding bill with no immigration restrictions			0
