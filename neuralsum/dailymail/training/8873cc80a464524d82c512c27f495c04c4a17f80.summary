@entity0 are on the verge of announcing @entity3 ’s £ 32million move to the @entity4 after confirming that @entity5 has officially joined the @entity7 champions			1
the deals will coincide with @entity9 leaving @entity0 to join @entity10 after the @entity12 club agreed to pay £ 12m up front for the @entity14 and a further £ 800,000 in add - ons based on their progress in @entity18			1
manager @entity19 remained tight - lipped over @entity3 ’s arrival on friday , saying : ‘ when things are finished we can talk about that			1
for the moment , @entity3 is not our player			0
however , it is understood that protracted negotiations have reached a conclusion and the @entity54 will finally complete his move , seven months after @entity0 first tried to sign him in the january transfer window			0
@entity3 will team up with his former @entity29 teammate @entity31 at @entity0			2
the @entity58 midfielder said : ‘ i ’ve played with him for a long time , he ’s a great player and a friend as well			0
‘ he ’s very quick and strong , very competitive			0
he might bring a different element to the team that @entity0 does n’t have , with his characteristics			0
’ big fan : @entity3 's former @entity29 team - mate @entity31 , right , moved to @entity7 champions this summer new boy : @entity0 announced the signing of @entity5 ( left ) from @entity68 on friday impressed : the 21 - year - old featured during @entity0 's pre-season tour of the @entity70 and scored against @entity71 confirmation of @entity5 ’s signing has been equally long in coming			1
the @entity75 under - 21 midfielder joined @entity0 from @entity68 for £ 3m in june and played on the club ’s pre-season tour of @entity70 , but the deal was only confirmed on friday night			1
he will go straight into the squad for sunday ’s @entity81 clash with @entity82 at @entity83			0
‘ i ’m very excited about the future , ’ said @entity5 , who becomes the fifth @entity84 to join @entity0 after @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88			2
‘ i am looking forward to the experiences which this move will bring and to improving myself as a player			0
’ on the move ? @entity9 looks set to seal a £ 12million move to @entity10 after @entity0 signed @entity31 meanwhile , @entity9 flew to @entity12 on friday to discuss personal terms after @entity0 agreed a fee with @entity10			1
the @entity98 midfielder signed from @entity99 for £ 15.8m in august 2012 but struggled to win a regular first - team place and made just 31 @entity7 starts in two years			2
the signings of @entity31 and @entity102 – and imminent arrival of @entity3 – meant that @entity0 had to cut their quota of foreign players and were prepared to listen to offers for @entity9 and @entity107			1
when @entity107 broke a bone in his foot last month , it became clear that @entity9 was the odd man out .			0

move for @entity3 comes *hot* on the heels of @entity5 's arrival
deal will coincide with @entity0 's @entity9 leaving for @entity10
the @entity12 *giants* will pay £ 12m up front for the former @entity99 midfielder
