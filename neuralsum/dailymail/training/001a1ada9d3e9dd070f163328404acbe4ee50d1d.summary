it was lost over 100 years ago in what many consider the worst maritime disaster in @entity4 history			1
on feb. 22 , 1901 , in a dense morning fog , the @entity5 struck jagged rocks near the @entity8 and sank almost immediately , killing 128 of the 210 passengers and crew aboard the ship			1
the ship was never found - until now			1
the @entity14 sonar images of the @entity5 , which reveal it on the seabed for the first time since it sank without trace on feb. 22 , 1901 , in a dense morning fog			1
the ships parts are clearly visible , even though it is in 287 feet of water , positioned inside the main ship channel , and buried in mud			1
the @entity26 and partners today released three - dimensional sonar maps and images of the immigrant steamship			2
' we are undertaking this exploration of the @entity33 in part to learn more about its maritime heritage as well as to test recent advances in technology that will allow us to better protect and understand the rich stories found beneath the @entity33 's waters , ' said @entity41 , director of maritime heritage for @entity26 's @entity42			2
the images also revealed that the ship did not , as rumoured , contain treasure			1
@entity5 was rumored to be full of silver treasure , but @entity41 said accounts of a shipment of ' @entity50 silver ' were actually bars of tin			1
' today the wreck is broken and filled with mud , and it is a sealed grave in fast , dangerous waters in the main shipping lanes , ' he said			1

where it was found : the area is in the centre of the image , which also shows two other shipwrecks , @entity69 and @entity70			0
on february 22 , 1901 the @entity5 was enveloped in thick morning fog while moving through the narrow entrance of the @entity8			0
without warning the ship struck @entity60			2
at the time of the stranding , an ebbing tide pushed the steamer back from the bridge and off the rocks			0
the @entity5 built by @entity80 in 1878 at @entity69 , @entity81			0
regularly transported passengers and cargo between @entity84 and @entity4 , photo taken at @entity86 , @entity87 , 1894			1
it was also used as a military boat , right , when during the @entity91 , the @entity90 charted @entity93 steamships as troopships			0
the ship 's bulkheads were not watertight , so it rapidly flooded , sinking within 10 minutes			1
many of the passengers , most of them @entity50 and @entity87 emigrants , were asleep in their cabins and died below			2
of the 210 on board , 128 lives were lost , making this shipwreck the highest loss of life at the @entity8			1
the ship is considered by historians as the ' @entity109 ' fishermen in the area , hearing the ship 's distress calls , helped rescue 82 survivors , many plucked from makeshift rafts and floating wreckage			1

the dead included @entity50 and @entity87 immigrants as well as the @entity126 consul - general in @entity127 , who was returning to the @entity126 on leave with his wife and two children			0
the entire family died in the tragedy			0
@entity5 , launched in 1878 , joined the fleet of the @entity93 , carrying passengers and freight to and from @entity4 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity87 and @entity127 as @entity126 expanded into the @entity138 and @entity139 after the @entity140			1
most @entity126 whose ancestors came to the @entity126 from the @entity138 in the 19th and early 20th centuries to start a new life arrived on ships like @entity5			0

in november , @entity159 and @entity160 donated a research vessel and crew , along with a high - powered remotely operated vehicle , to help @entity26 pinpoint and map the @entity5 wreck site using sonar developed by @entity167			1
@entity169 - based salvagers found the wreck in the 1980s , but its exact location was unknown as the coordinates they provided did not coincide with any wreck charted by @entity26 through years of sonar work			2
during this expedition , @entity176 , @entity177 , worked with @entity41 and multibeam sonar expert @entity179 to locate the wreck site again			2
they located the site in 287 feet of water , positioned inside the main ship channel , and largely buried in mud			1
@entity176 and the @entity159 team captured the first detailed sonar and three - dimensional images of @entity188 resting in the dark , muddy waters outside the bridge			2
' the level of detail and clarity from the sonar survey is amazing , ' @entity176 said			0
' we now have a much better sense of both wrecks , and of how they not only sank , but what has happened to them since their loss			0
' the 3 - d model generated by the @entity205 ' sonar also gave researchers an entirely new perspective on the condition of the wreck site			0
what they found was a crumpled , scarcely recognizable iron hulk encased in more than a century worth of mud and sediment , lending support to the narrative that the ship sank quickly before many of its passengers could escape			1
@entity219 , research vessel @entity220 with @entity223 @entity222 ( @entity224 ) / @entity225 ( @entity225 ) equipped with @entity227 sonar , which was used to create the amazing images			0
the expedition team also remapped the @entity230 , a second nearby wreck that was rediscovered in may 2013 by @entity26 's @entity232			0
in stark contrast to the @entity188 , the @entity14 revealed in great detail the surprising level of preservation of the @entity69 's frame and propulsion machinery , telling a very different story about the circumstances of its sinking			1
to date @entity26 has plotted nine of nearly 200 ships including four never before found vessels			0
the @entity26 's @entity246 is engaged in a two - year study to discover and document shipwrecks in @entity249 and nearby @entity250 .			0

*accident* *dubbed* ' @entity109 ' and many consider it worst maritime disaster in @entity4 history

*3d* scans have revealed the wreck in 287 feet of water , positioned inside the main ship channel , and buried in mud
