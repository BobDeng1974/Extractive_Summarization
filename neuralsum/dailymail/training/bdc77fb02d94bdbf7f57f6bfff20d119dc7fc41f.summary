@entity1 units where nurses are looking after more than four patients at a time are unsafe , new guidance from the health watchdog states			2
@entity7 has issued recommended staffing levels for casualty departments over concerns many are dangerously overcrowded , particularly during very busy periods , such as bank holidays			1
recently there have been reports nurses have had to look after as many as 15 patients at a time			1
now the guidance states that there must be at least one nurse for every four patients in a cubicle bed at all times of the day and night			1
@entity1 units where nurses are looking after more than four patients have been deemed unsafe			2
pictured , an overflow ambulance treatment at the @entity26 , @entity27 and for life - threatening cases , such as cardiac arrests or road traffic accidents , there must be two dedicated nurses for each patient			1
the guidelines will be taken into account by the @entity37 watchdog during inspections , meaning hospitals face a bad rating if they fall short of the ratio			0
but mps and healthcare experts warned that many @entity45 units are ‘ nowhere near ’ this safe level			0
only last week an unprecedented 13 hospitals declared major incidents within a 36 - hour period and implemented plans reserved for rail crashes or terrorism			0
they included the @entity53 , where at one point there were two nurses attending to more than 30 patients			0
later today the @entity58 will publish its latest figures on @entity45 waiting times			0
the previous two weeks have been the worst on record			0
the new guidelines point out that at present , many casualty departments do not plan for particularly busy periods such as festivals , marathons or the first working day after a bank holiday			1
now they must ensure these days are adequately staffed , and , if necessary , nurses should be banned from taking holiday if there is a major event in the local area			0
managers are also urged to set up standby rotas whereby off - duty nurses can be drafted in if there is a surge of patients			2
professor @entity80 , director of clinical practice at @entity7 , said : ‘ as demand on @entity45 services continues to increase , we want to ensure that each and every @entity45 department across the country is clear on how to get nurse staffing right and is able to provide safe care to the millions of patients who walk through the door			1
’ @entity92 , pictured , declared a major incident after being overrun with patients in the @entity45 department but the @entity96 said that in reality , most casualty departments are a long way off @entity7 ’s new limits			1
chief executive dr @entity101 added : ‘ @entity7 have recognised that this is not just a winter crisis and that only long - term planning can tackle staffing issues			1
’ @entity7 said it did not yet have figures for how many @entity45 units do not have enough nurses			2
a @entity109 spokesman insisted that most @entity45 units did meet the requirement for at least one nurse for every four patients .			0
