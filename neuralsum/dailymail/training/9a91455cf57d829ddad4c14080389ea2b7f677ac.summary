a lack of exercise rather than diet is to blame for the obesity crisis , experts have warned			2
a new study in the @entity6 found activity levels have fallen dramatically in the last 20 years as average body mass index ( @entity9 ) increased and calorie intake remained the same			1
scientists said a drop in exercise and leisure time , especially among young women , may be responsible for rising obesity rates			1
it is recommended adults do 150 minutes of moderate exercise - brisk walking , cycling or gardening , for example - each week			1
a new study has revealed a lack of exercise is responsible for bulging waistlines and the obesity crisis , not calorie intake but studies have shown around two in three adults in the @entity32 fail to achieve the guidelines			1
fewer manual jobs , more cars and home entertainment technology mean most people get much less exercise now than their parents or grandparents did			2
two thirds of men and almost six in 10 women in the @entity32 are overweight or obese			0
in @entity46 just @entity44 and @entity45 have higher numbers of obese or overweight people			0
by analysing data from the @entity51 ( @entity51 ) researchers found the number of @entity6 women who reported no physical activity jumped from 19.1 per cent in 1994 to 51.7 per cent in 2010			2
for men , the number rose from 11.4 per cent to 43.5 per cent			0
during the period , average @entity9 has increased across the board , with the most dramatic rise found among young women between 18 and 39			1
professor @entity60 , of @entity61 , @entity62 , said : ' these changes have occurred in the context of substantial increases in the proportion of adults reporting no leisure time physical activity , but in the absence of any significant population level changes in average daily caloric intake			1
' at the population level , we found a significant association between the level of leisure time physical activity , but not daily caloric intake , and the increases in both @entity9 and waist circumference			1
' the research , carried out at the @entity81 , showed in 20 years @entity9 levels had risen as calorie intake remained the same the study , published in the @entity85 , looked at the escalation of obesity in terms of both exercise and caloric intake			1
while the researchers did not examine what types of foods were consumed , they did observe total daily calorie , fat , carbohydrate , and protein consumption have not changed significantly over the period , yet the obesity rate among participants continued to rise			2
researchers also tracked the rise in abdominal obesity , which is an independent indicator of mortality even among people with normal bmis			0
this is defined by a waist circumference of at least 34.65sin ( 88cm ) for women and 40.16ins ( 102cm ) for men			0
the average increased by 0.37 per cent and 0.27 per cent respectively , per year			0
just like the rise in average @entity118 , the group most affected by increased rates of abdominal obesity was women			0
prof @entity60 said : ' the prevalence of abdominal obesity has increased among normal weight women and overweight women and men			0
' it remains controversial whether overweight alone increases mortality risk , but the trends in abdominal obesity among the overweight are concerning in light of the risks associated with increased waist circumference independent of @entity9			2
' while increased calorie intake is often blamed for rising rates of obesity , no association between the two factors was identified in the study			1
in contrast , an association was found between the trends over time for lack of physical activity and high @entity9 numbers			1
prof @entity60 said : ' our findings do not support the popular notion the increase of obesity in the @entity6 can be attributed primarily to sustained increase over time in the average daily caloric intake of @entity6			2
' identifying the link between the drop in physical activity and increased bmis , as well as the groups particularly affected , can assist public health officials to develop targeted , effective interventions against the obesity epidemic			0
journal editor @entity159 said : ' if we as a country truly want to take control of our health and our health care costs , the @entity60 et al paper should be our clarion call			0
' from encouraging communities to provide safe places for physical activity to ensuring ample supply of healthy food to empowering @entity6 to take control of their health , we must launch a concerted comprehensive effort to control obesity			0

scientists found activity levels have fallen in 20 years as @entity9 has risen and calorie intake has remained the same
it is recommended adults do 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week
studies have shown around two in three fail to achieve recommended levels
