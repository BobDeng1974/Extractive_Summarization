new footage of a terrifying skydiving accident caused when two planes collided in mid-air shows the frantic split seconds as the jumpers scramble out of the plummeting wreckage			1
the video is a jumper 's eye - view from deep inside the @entity11 aircraft during the dramatic crash 12,000ft above @entity13 , @entity14 , last month			1
it captures the screams of panic as the skydivers realise their aircraft is about to slam into the plane below them			1
it shows those on the wing hurled on to the roof of the lower plane and momentarily pinned between the aircraft			1
one skydiver clings onto a bar holding while he is spun upside down			0
the skydivers are flung around like rag dolls by the violent impact which ripped one wing off and caused a fireball to erupt			2
queuing : the skydiver waits in line to jump from the plane 12,000ft above the ground too close for comfort : the tracking plane below edges closer as the skydivers prepare to jump : drama : as three skydivers edge out of the plane , the other aircraft rears into view fear : the jumpers scream as they realise they are on a collision course collision : the two planes slam into each other , throwing several of the skydivers clear of the wreckage squashed : several of the skydivers find themselves pressed between both planes impact : the skydivers are violently shaken as the planes collide those on the wing manage to jump clear of the burning wreckage , but the video shows several skydivers frantic efforts to scramble to the door and leap clear			1
while the plane spirals out of control , the disorientated jumpers find their way to the opening of the mangled aircraft			1
all nine skydivers miraculously survived their brush with death			1
@entity93 , who piloted the plane which exploded in a fireball was able to bailout and pull his emergency parachute			1
@entity98 , the pilot of the other aircraft , managed to fly his badly damaged plane back to the airport in one piece			1
@entity103 : the wings of the planes smash together as the skydivers desperately cling on @entity103 : one of the jumpers grabs hold of part of the wing as the plane spins violently out of control fireball : the stunned skydiver is still clutching the wing of the damaged plane as an explosion erupts disorientated : the new video shows one of the skydivers being flung around as he tries waits to clear debris before releasing shock : a skydiver is flung head over heels as he holds on to the wing of the plane which is plummeting out of the air relief : finally , the skydiver who was trapped at the back of the plane is able to leap from the open door and to safety @entity93 was at the controls of one of two single - engine planes that were flying over @entity13 , @entity14 , with a group of experienced skydivers who were making their last jump of the day , during an interview last month			1
but what was supposed to be a moment of perfectly - timed air acrobatics and exhilarating free - falls turned into a terrifying jump - for - your - life situation when @entity93 's @entity11 suddenly sandwiched on top of the other			1
explosion : skydivers watched on powerlessly as one of the two planes disintegrated after impact impact : this is the moment the two planes hit , sending divers who were preparing to jump flying out of the aircraft and causing the wing of the other to come off incredible : five of the skydivers involved in the @entity14 plane crash can be seen freefalling and the plane @entity93 was flying on flames and hurtling to the ground split apart : both wings of the lead plane became detached and @entity170 said he watched it crash to the ground in three pieces falling pieces : several people in the superior area reported seeing the plane falling to the ground but no one was injured by the debris quick thinking : the pilot of the tracking plane was able to land it safely , but the lead plane was not so lucky			1
it crashed to the ground in several piece			2
the pilot of that airplane escaped by parachute as well speaking about the moment he said : ' and all of a sudden i hear this loud bang			2
i did n't see anything ... i just heard a bang and the windshield immediately shattered			2
' the crash tore off the wing of the plane and the gas tank blew up underneath and caught fire , causing the plane to go into an ' uncontrolled descent '			1
' i was staring straight ahead			0
and the first thing i remember thinking is that i need to regain control of this airplane , ' the 23 - year - old told @entity208 in an exclusive @entity210 interview airing tonight at 8pm			1
' and i immediately pulled the yoke back to my chest and pulled it back as far as i possibly could			0
and there was no reaction from the airplane			0
' i began to pick up more and more airspeed			0
and i realize that i have no control of this aircraft			2
and probably thought it was in my best interest to not be in this aircraft			0
' bloody : after @entity93 landed safely on the ground , he took a ' selfie ' to document his injuries , his face covered in blood from where the windshield shattered in his face after the planes collided survivor : @entity93 was at the controls of one of two single - engine planes that were flying over @entity13 , @entity14 , and tells @entity208 for @entity236 's @entity210 about his death - defying leap fortunately he was wearing a parachute and though he had only done two tandem jumps before , he had to recall everything he learned as he jumped head first from the gap where the wing used to be			1
he got himself into the proper arched position for a free fall and withstood the temptation to open the chute immediately , waiting until he was at the recommended 4,000 to 5,000 feet , @entity236 reports			0
he landed hard somewhere near the runway and somersaulted to a stop			0
when he realized he was ok he decided to take a picture of himself to document his injuries			2
had he not , then the 23 - year - old would not have believed he had done what he did , he reveals on the @entity210 special			2
the photo shows his face covered in blood from the shards of glass that flew at him when the @entity11 's windshield shattered on impact			1
he also had serious cuts on his hands not seen in the picture that took 25 stitches to repair			2
@entity14 skydivers : when asked by @entity208 if they would get back into a plane again after their miraculous escape , all nine put up their hands with one women admitting she is more afraid of spiders @entity275 , left , remembers the pilot screaming at them to ' @entity278 ' , ordering them to jump			1
' that 's probably the worst , was hearing him scream , ' she said through tears			2
' it 's pretty raw			2
' when he saw the other pilot safely land his plane and then each skydiver parachute to the ground unhurt , he called it a miracle			1
one of the skydivers @entity292 told @entity208 on the today show this week that he tried to chase @entity93 's plane that was on fire as he was free - falling to see if the pilot was ok			1
when he saw him jump from the plane , he chased him to make sure he could open his chute			2
' @entity300 had parachutes on , so they were kind of on their own , so i chased the plane			0
i think @entity304 did too , he came down with me , ' he said			0
' we chased the airplane to see if the pilot got out			0
once i saw the pilot bail out , i made sure he was going to open the parachute because he was a student			0
' @entity310 , who became wedged in between the two planes and almost collided with the propeller said : ' it was unpleasant			0
i had no time to react ...			0
the sound behind me , i 'll never forget			0
' and that 's all i could do was try and stay forward and try not to move because i knew i was going to live where i was , or thought i could			0
' @entity98 , who managed to fly one of the planes to safety and land perfectly at @entity321 in @entity322 , joked that it was one of his better landings and said he has no idea how the crash occurred			1
' everything was as it should have been , ' he said			0
' we were just kind of lucky that we were at the point where we were out of the airplane , ' said 64 - year - old flight instructor @entity170 , who was in the lead plane			1
' if we 'd been back in the rear of the airplane when they collided it might have been a little bit different			0
' once out of the plane , the skydivers had to carefully maneuver their chutes to stay out of the path of raining debris			1
' we 're in free fall , so we 're falling about 120 miles miles an hour vertically down , ' mr @entity170 said			0
' but then we open our parachutes , and now all of a sudden they 're falling faster than we are ... fortunately , everybody kept it together so they just avoided ( the debris )			0
' miraculously , no one on the ground was injured by the falling wreckage - but plenty saw them crash to the ground			1
the @entity354 will investigate the crash			0
it 's still uncertain what will happen to the skydiving company , since they only owned the two planes			0
but it is the end of their season anyway			0
mr @entity170 says the crash yesterday happened during the fourth jump of his day , and that he 's done over 900 jumps in his lifetime			2
' i 'll remember this one more than most , ' he said .			0
