by @entity0 published : 18:09 est , 25 june 2013 updated : 18:09 est , 25 june 2013 carrying just four pounds too many can raise your risk of heart disease by a fifth carrying just four pounds too many can raise your risk of heart disease by a fifth , according to new research			1
a large scale study found being overweight really does cause @entity9 ’s biggest killer - as well as diabetes			1
alarmingly , an increase of only one unit of @entity13 ( body mass index ) , equivalent to 4 to 12lbs depending on height , made the participants 20 per cent more likely to develop heart failure			1
meanwhile , obesity also led to higher levels of insulin , higher blood pressure , higher cholesterol and inflammation and more cases of diabetes			1
professor @entity25 , of @entity26 , @entity27 , said : ‘ this knowledge is important , as it strengthens the evidence forceful societal measures need to be taken to counteract the epidemic of obesity and its consequences			2
’ his team used a new method to investigate the link between weight and cardiovascular disease because , despite previous evidence , it has not been clear whether too much fat was just a marker of another underlying cause			2
the study , published in the journal @entity45 , was an attempt to determine whether obesity as such is the actual cause or a signal of another lifestyle factor that triggers these diseases			0
dr @entity52 , also of @entity26 , said : ‘ we knew already obesity and cardiovascular disease often occur together			1
however , it has been hard to determine whether increased @entity13 as such is dangerous			1
‘ in this study we found individuals with gene variants that lead to increased body - mass index ( @entity13 ) also had an increased risk of heart failure and diabetes			1
the risk of developing diabetes was greater than was previously thought			0
’ the researchers analysed whether a mutation in the @entity67 gene , which regulates the appetite and increases an individual ’s @entity13 , was also linked to a series of cardiovascular diseases and metabolism			2
this risk variant is common in the population , and each copy increases @entity13 by an average of between 0.3 and 0.4 points			1
since an individual ’s genome is not affected by lifestyle and social factors , but rather is established at conception when the embryo randomly receives half of each parent ’s genome , the method is called ‘ mendelian randomization ’			0
to achieve reliable results a large group was required , so almost 200,000 individuals from @entity92 and @entity93 were recruited			0
professor @entity25 said : ‘ epidemiological studies look for associations in large populations , but it is usually difficult to reliably determine cause and effect - what we call causality			0
‘ by using this new genetic method , @entity105 randomization , in our research we can now confirm what many people have long believed , that increased @entity13 contributes to the development of heart failure			1
we also found that being overweight causes increases in liver enzymes			0
this can lead to liver disease			0
’ an increase of only one unit of @entity13 , equivalent to between 4 and 12lbs depending on a person 's height , makes a person 20 per cent more likely to develop heart failure @entity13 is calculated by taking your weight , in kilograms , and dividing it by your height squared , in metres , and is a way to compare the weights of groups of people of different heights			1
underweight is a @entity13 under 18.5 , normal is between 18.5 and 25 , between 25 and 30 is overweight and above 30 is obese			2
coronary heart disease causes about 82,000 deaths each year in the @entity9			1
an estimated 70,000 to 75,000 people with diabetes die in @entity136 every year , accounting for about 15 per cent of all deaths			0
@entity138 , spokesman for the @entity139 and chairman of the @entity141 , described the findings as ‘ very important ’			0
he said : ‘ what is really exciting is they have pinned down causality , which is essential when coming up with any pronouncement like this			0
‘ it is not a totally new method , it has been around for about fifteen years , but the database is so large you can now say “ hand on heart ” being overweight causes heart failure			0
this is the final evidence			0
‘ measuring @entity13 has been criticised as an inexact science , and has been rubbished , but if you monitored patients over a long period it could become extremely exact			2
‘ a bmi of 30 is obese , and if it then rises to 31 , 32 , 33 , and 34 which is morbidly obese , if your risk of heart failure is going up by 20 per cent each time then you could be a goner			2

an increase of just one @entity13 point can raise heart disease risk by a fifth
obesity also raises insulin levels , blood pressure , and cholesterol
heart disease kills 82,000 @entity9 each year and numbers are rising
