by @entity0 published : 04:17 est , 18 july 2013 updated : 06:51 est , 22 july 2013 thrill - seekers looking for a new way to get their adrenaline pumping may want to head to the @entity4 , @entity5 , where a new ride has trumped all other river swings			1
dangling over a crevice that disappears 1,300 feet below , this new ride then swings at 50 - miles - an - hour over the @entity9 , in @entity10 , @entity4			1
but whether or not customers will get a chance to enjoy the view is unlikely			2
mr @entity25 , 41 , admits that despite designing the new ride , he has only ever tried it out for himself on one occasion			1
' funnily enough , even though i came up with the whole idea for the ride , i have only ever ridden it once , ' he said			0
' we had a different swing on the site for several years , but we wanted something more extreme			1
' when it came time to replace it , the @entity37 seemed like the perfect fit			0
a tiny scaffold blip atop the 1,300ft cliff , puts the scale of the drop beneath the ride into perspective @entity47 for heights : propelled at 50mph while dangling high above the @entity9 , this ride is sure to get the adrenaline going , for those brave enough to try it ' it 's pneumatically powered and much faster , so it 's definitely a bigger adrenaline rush			1
' and the spot on the edge of @entity57 makes it even more exciting			2
' @entity25 explained why despite the apparent danger , thrill - seekers still flock to this one - of - a - kind contraption			1
' the reaction from the public is definitely mixed , ' he said			0
' people usually scream when they 're riding it , so first - timers hear that as they 're walking up to the ride			0
' then when they see the drop off down into the canyon , they 're either thrilled or terrified , and sometimes both			0
' it 's a lot of fun just to watch people ride it , see their faces and hear them scream and laugh			2
