by @entity0 last updated at 9:25 am on 28th february 2012 television presenter @entity1 has claimed a ‘ chemical cosh ’ of dementia drugs robbed her father of the final weeks of his life			1
the former @entity7 host described how her father @entity8 was given a vast cocktail of medicines which left him so heavily sedated he was ‘ totally out of it ’			1
his medication covered two sides of an @entity15 sheet of paper , she said			2
heartbroken : @entity1 , pictured with her father @entity8 in 2009 , claimed that dementia drugs robbed him of the final weeks of his life @entity19 ’s sufferer mr @entity18 died earlier this month			1
his rapid deterioration has led his daughter to question whether the drugs cost him years of his life			2
she said : ‘ i am so angry at the way my lovely , lovely dad was treated at the end			2
in his final weeks he was so coshed by drugs that his poor body could n’t cope			1
‘ they robbed him of his laughter , then his smile , which was all that he had got left , and i am absolutely furious about that			2
then they robbed him of his life			2
‘ that is what is keeping me awake at night now , it ’s the anger			2
without the powerful drugs they used to sedate him he could have had another few years			2
tragic : @entity1 , second from right , with her mother @entity39 who died in 2006 and father @entity8 who died in 2012 by @entity40 more than a quarter of elderly people with dementia are being given dangerous ‘ chemical cosh ’ drugs , researchers warn			1
doctors are prescribing anti-psychotics to patients for two or more years even though they are only meant to be taken for a maximum of three months – and then only as a last resort			0
antipsychotics are tranquillisers that are designed to treat hallucinations in patients with schizophrenia or other mental illnesses			0
but researchers from the @entity59 have found that in most cases they are just being given to sedate elderly patients to stop them from wandering off or becoming confused and anxious			0
campaigners say that too often they are being told by families and carers that such drugs are ‘ robbing loved ones of their dignity ’ , leaving them unable to walk or talk			0
the drugs were given the chemical cosh nickname because they are used to subdue patients , which makes it easier for hospital and care home staff to look after them			0
but researchers have warned that they double the risk of early death – leading to an estimated 1,800 premature deaths a year – and treble the risk of strokes			0
studies have also found they reduce brain volume and worsen the symptoms of dementia			1
typical antipsychotics given to patients include chlorpromazine , perphenazine , pimozide , clozapine ( sold as @entity92 or @entity93 ) , olanzapine ( sold as @entity95 ) and risperidone ( sold as @entity97 )			0
but only risperidone is licensed for dementia – and then only for up to six weeks			1
‘ maybe i ’m being selfish because he would n’t have wanted to continue to be dependent on others			0
but that was n’t a decision to be made by the medical system on his behalf ... without those drugs he could still have been healthy and happy , even with dementia			1
’ miss @entity1 , 51 , has endured watching both her parents succumb to @entity19 ’s and has told of her fears she may also develop the degenerative disease			1
her mother @entity39 was diagnosed in her late 50s and died in 2006 , just a few months before mr @entity18 also received the devastating diagnosis			1
he was in his late 60s			0
miss @entity1 , a @entity115 columnist , told the newspaper her father had managed a degree of independence despite the disease , and lived in a warden - assisted flat in @entity123 for three years			1
but last november he went missing for eight hours after he wandered off alone			0
social workers insisted he was sent to a specialist dementia care home			1
the placement lasted just 24 hours before managers complained that he had lashed out at a carer			0
he was moved to a psychiatric hospital , where he was immediately put on a mixture of drugs			0
miss @entity1 said : ‘ i visited him on december 23 and he was smiling and laughing and said “ she ’s mine ” when i walked in , which had been his way of greeting me for a while			1
‘ even though he no longer said my name , he recognised me			0
all the members of staff said how wonderful he was			0
’ but when she returned a few days later , she said she found her father slumped in a chair and heavily sedated			1
she requested a list of his medication and said it stretched to two sides of @entity15 paper			0
miss @entity1 recalled how she asked for the drugs to be reduced and told how her own research had shown two sedatives he was taking were addictive and could cause cognitive decline			1
in addition , she said that the anti-psychotic drug he was on was known to increase the risk of death in dementia sufferers and was advised as a last resort			1
@entity1 quit her role as @entity7 presenter after 12 years to spend more time with her family she described her shock on her next visit at her father ’s rapid deterioration , saying : ‘ he ’d put on weight from the drugs and his hair was white			1
“ @entity167 , ” i said , “ what have they done to you ? ” and i broke down in tears			0
‘ but there was no response , he was totally out of it			0
his body had been clobbered with drugs			0
‘ he was like someone out of @entity179			1
next time i went his eyes were glazed , his mouth was hanging open and his tongue was lolling			0
’ miss @entity1 said she alerted nurses to her father ’s laboured breathing and high temperature and , six days later , he was admitted to a general hospital with pneumonia			1
doctors warned his organs were failing			0
he died a few days later , aged 77			0
researchers have revealed that more than a quarter of elderly dementia sufferers are being subdued with ‘ chemical cosh ’ drugs			1
they warned earlier this month that some medications can double the risk of early death – leading to an estimated 1,800 premature deaths a year – and treble the risk of strokes			0
studies have also found they reduce brain volume and worsen the symptoms of dementia			2
the @entity208 has long called for an improvement in the care of dementia sufferers as part of our dignity for the @entity216 campaign			2
miss @entity1 , who has two sons , @entity218 , 12 , and @entity219 , nine , with her husband @entity220 , has become an ambassador for the @entity222			1
