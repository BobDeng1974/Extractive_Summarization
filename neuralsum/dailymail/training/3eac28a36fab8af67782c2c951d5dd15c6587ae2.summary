it was close to 17 years ago , within the distance of a well struck goal - kick from the banks of the @entity4 , that this all began			0
the date was september 6 , 1997 and @entity7 beat @entity8 3 - 2 at the @entity9			1
playing together competitively for the first time were @entity11 and @entity12 — the @entity13 of world football			1
no - one who was lucky enough to hear @entity16 ’ n @entity17 play for the first time , in the @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 back in july 1962 , would have guessed that they ’d still be filling stadia in summer 2014			0
and while their friendship — which has unified the @entity7 squad , helping erase factions and frictions — is a key pillar in @entity7 ’s historic trophy treble , there ’s something else about them			1
clearly these are two of the great footballers of @entity51 history			1
talented , technically intelligent — leaders			0
but they both possess a crucial need to keep on winning			2
maybe it ’s only the need for the megabucks which a well - run world tour can generate that keeps the @entity13 on the road			0
but i doubt that it ’s as simple as that			0
they , too , have a need to compete ( with each other ) , a need to show the world that they can still cut it			0
and that is at the heart of the challenge facing the @entity7 of @entity11 and @entity12 this summer			1
side - by - side : @entity12 and @entity11 are chasing back - to - back @entity9 wins when their critics talk of @entity7 being ‘ over the hill ’ or that this might be ‘ one tournament too many ’ it ’s really @entity12 they are talking about			1
others will be quoted — @entity82 , @entity81 , @entity11 , @entity83 — but @entity84 just won @entity85 and made it to the @entity87 final , @entity81 won the @entity88 and played a massive role in helping @entity90 become @entity51 champions , despite being banned for the final when a silly booking in the semi-final trip blotted what had been an outstanding performance in @entity97			1
@entity11 , too , had a hand in @entity90 ’s cup double			1
but @entity12 is the daddy of the group			1
not only 34 , but in the creative hot - house which has dug @entity7 out of so many dodgy situations while teams tried to shut them down or bully them out of games over the last three major tournaments			1
the way that he and @entity110 link up down the centre of the pitch has accounted for a host of sumptuous tournament goals — either one of them given an extra inch or two of space and they ’ll wriggle and fire off a salvo of passes and that ’s that			0
nevertheless , for some years ( beginning with @entity124 ’s @entity90 during the @entity126 wars of 2011 ) teams have decided to harass and try to test @entity12 ’s athleticism — his will to run			1
there ’s no denying that this all - time great of our sport is now struggling to put in a full offensive and defensive shift			2
if an opponent , with or without the ball , runs away from him , then it ’s less assured that @entity12 will be willing or able to track back and help avoid ‘ overload ’ on the defence			1
tempus fugit — time flies — but it always has			0
every great footballer has confronted this sudden draining of super powers			2
a magical journey : @entity11 hoists the @entity9 aloft four years ago as @entity7 capped their dominance of the global game it ’s how to cope , how to combat it , how to slow down time ’s rusting process which @entity149 back in @entity148 , @entity12 felt the scythe			1
if not of @entity151 himself then of the critics , mostly @entity154 it has to be said , who felt his influence had declined			0
the matches chafed for @entity12 , he was irked at being sniped at and still more narked that he felt he was n’t putting his mark on games			1
@entity11 ’s challenges have been many , but not identical			1
it ’s famous that his iron - clad individuality saw him stand up to , and clash with , @entity124 — to the extent that he was ( unfairly ) dropped			0
that was the tributary which led to a cascade ; his place with @entity7 might have been in jeopardy given @entity170 ’s decision to maintain @entity171 ( not even at this tournament ) as @entity90 ’s no 1			1
plenty to ponder : @entity11 and @entity124 did not see eye - to - eye some @entity90 fans demonised him as the @entity179 ring leader — he ’s thought about leaving the club			2
but guys like these two know how to deal with adversity			0
there they were , if you cared to look , sat side by side on a bench at the side of the training pitch in @entity190 in midweek			0
they sat for 15 minutes talking about this and that , mostly that , while the rest of the squad did their thing			0
two ‘ veteran ’ warriors			0
planning the assault to come			0
and this is the nub of the thing			0
around the world people are desperate to write about the end of an era — the football decrepitude which ‘ apparently ’ is about to engulf @entity7			2
while sporting obituaries are being written in advance of any actual fatality , @entity7 ’s ‘ vets ’ are obsessed by only one thing — not their legacy , not the € 700,000 bonus which allegedly they stand to win			2
instead they are obsessed with repeating the triumph , becoming the first country to retain this title since @entity217 did it in 1962			0
part of that has to do with their characters			0
@entity12 pondered international retirement two years ago in @entity223 , before winning the @entity224 , and told @entity225 so			1
the manager said to him : ‘ are you crazy ? are you in a depression ? ’ — and challenged @entity12 to have a tilt at winning the most famous trophy in the world in the country most associated with doing just that thing			1
@entity81 , @entity235 , @entity236 , @entity110 share that mentality , i know			0
earlier this year , @entity239 , @entity7 ’s former national coach , died			1
it was the old bear , @entity241 , who knew best how to harness the powers of @entity11 and @entity12			1
it was n’t him who set them off in @entity37 all those years ago but , when he inherited them , he knew that this was an axis of greatness			2
two men upon whom he could build a dream era — the captain - keeper and the champion - creator			0
on their will to win , their friendship , their ability to unify disparate talents , @entity241 constructed a football family — like - minded , similar dna , a spread of ages			2
old friends : @entity12 and @entity11 take some time out from training to ponder yet another successful @entity9 he had many phrases , and they are repeated			1
@entity83 admitted this week : ‘ not a day goes past in this squad where one of his sayings or an anecdote about him is n’t re-told			2
it ’s like he ’s still with us			0
’ one became a favourite of the players : ‘ @entity271 , ’ — whoever dominates the ball , dominates the game			0
more now than ever that will work for @entity7			2
this climate does n’t give a premium for those who run around chasing possession			2
step forward @entity12 , still capable of keeping and using the football with precision and consistency.but it ’s the other @entity239 phrase which i think might allow @entity7 to surprise their critics and early obituary writers			1
he told his troops : ‘ @entity288 ... ’ — win , win , win			0
he made them shed the nicey - nicey stuff , the ‘ we are not worthy ’ and he made them tremendously hard - nosed			0
he made this @entity7 group believe that winning was n’t something , it was everything			1
driving force : @entity12 ( right ) is the heartbeat of this @entity7 side even at the age of 34 what many forget is that the phrase had an extension			1
he used it , famously , in one of those press conferences which made him extra famous			0
thumping his closed fist on the desk in front of him he said that it was all about ‘ @entity314 ’ but then he added ‘ y volver a ganer , y ganar y ganar , ’ — win , win , win and then go back and win , win , win again			0
that ’s the spirit he encountered in @entity11 and @entity12 and , 17 years on , that ’s what they are here in @entity217 to do			1
write @entity7 off at your peril .			2

@entity12 and @entity11 first played competitively together in 1997 as @entity7 beat @entity8 in the @entity9
the pair forged a great friendship which helped to forge the *modern* @entity7 , double @entity51 champions and @entity9 *holders*
former coach @entity239 made this @entity7 group believe that winning was n’t something , it was everything
