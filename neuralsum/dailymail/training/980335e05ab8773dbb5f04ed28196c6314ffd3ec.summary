@entity5 , 20 , recoiled in horror after spotting the mollusc while eating her mashed potato at @entity9			1
the model and musician , who was recovering with new baby @entity13 , has vowed never to eat hospital food again			1
sick : the snail was found in ms @entity5 's dinner at @entity17 after she gave birth ' at first i did n't even notice it , ' she said			1
' but then i started eating and after one or two mouthfuls i saw it			0
' i stopped and said " that looks like a snail			0
" i looked closer and i started repeating " oh my god , what is that ? " and then @entity28 my fiance said " it 's definitely a snail			0
" ' it was still alive and i just felt totally sick			0
' ms @entity5 , who was already worried about the quality of hospital food before the incident on november 29 , admitted the experience has put her off hospital food for life			1
she said : ' when you 're going through all the emotions after giving birth and then you 're worried about your child if she 's not doing too well , it 's not a good experience to have when you just want to eat			2
' ms @entity5 , from @entity9 , @entity44 , contacted @entity45 , the chief executive of @entity46 , to complain about the event and she received an apology on tuesday			1
horror : @entity5 was shocked to discover a snail in her food at the maternity unit where she gave birth to daughter @entity13 mr @entity45 's letter said he was concerned to hear about the ' upsetting experience ' and an investigation revealed the snail had found its way onto the plate via a packet of frozen peas			1
he added : ' these peas have been returned to the supplier for them to conduct their own investigations and respond to @entity46			2
' on behalf of @entity46 , i offer my sincere apologies for the distress this incident must have caused you and would wish to assure you that this is an isolated incident			0
' but ms @entity5 has called for the hospital 's food standards to improve			1
she said : ' they said that i could take a tour of their kitchen to try and change my opinion of them but i do n't think it 's good enough			0
chief executive @entity45 wrote to ms @entity5 who found a snail in her hospital food apologising the snail made its way onto ms @entity5 's plate via frozen peas served at @entity17 ( pictured ) ' i think they need to look into it and make their standards better , not just the supplier that it went through , but also the @entity93 , the kitchen and then the people actually handing out the meals			1
' it goes through quite a lot of hands and so for it to go unnoticed is shocking			0
' i just want to prevent this happening to someone else because it 's not really something people should have to go through when they 're in hospital			0
' a spokesman for @entity46 added : ' this is a supply chain issue and we have taken the matter up with the company			0
' more than 3,000 meals a day are cooked for our hospitals , and all our kitchens are subject to regular environmental health inspections			0
' food is bought under a national contract and in this case the peas are cooked in bulk before being plated			2
' we were dismayed to learn of the presence of a foreign body in this meal and will share the outcome of the supplier 's investigation with ms @entity5			2
