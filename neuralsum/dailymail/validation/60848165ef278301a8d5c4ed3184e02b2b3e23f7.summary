fast food chain @entity0 has been slammed by the @entity2 for making ' misleading and erroneous ' advertising claims about their food being preservative and @entity6 free fast food chain @entity0 has been slammed by a lobby group for making ' misleading and erroneous ' advertising claims that its food is free of ' anything artificial '			1
the @entity2 , made up of over 10,000 @entity13 and @entity14 families , has lodged a complaint against the fast food giant with the @entity17 ( @entity17 ) , claiming that @entity0 's product range is filled with artificial additives and @entity6 despite the company 's claims of the contrary			1
dr @entity23 , the co-founder of the network who has a doctrine in food technology , told @entity28 that by simply studying the nutritional information provided for each product on @entity0 's website , he managed to identify over 12 items with @entity6 and seven synthetic antioxidants in various items			1
these include artificial additives that were identified as of concern for children by the @entity40 @entity39			2
' their advertisement clearly stated " you wo n't find anything artificial in any of the food made by us " ; that is misleading , ' dr @entity41 said			1
he said that other false claims made by @entity0 since september were ' 100 per cent @entity50 ' and ' our chicken nuggets … are preservative free '			2
' synthetic antioxidant 319 tert - @entity52 is in the canola oil used to cook the @entity54 and @entity55			0
while this is not technically a preservative it is added to preserve the oil , and the oil is not ' 100 per cent ' as claimed			0
the products contain ingredients that are artificial , ' dr @entity41 's complaint states			0
co-founder of the group and food technologist @entity23 took this screen shot of what he described as a ' misleading ' advertisement by the fast food giant however he claims the company has since changed the wording on their website dr @entity41 said that by simply studying the nutritional information provided for each product on @entity0 's website , he managed to identify over 12 items with @entity6 and seven synthetic antioxidants in various items ' preservative 220 sulphur dioxide is in the guilt - free tenders salad dressing			1
this additive requires a public warning on any ingredient label due to asthma concerns			0
their website currently claims incorrectly that there is no sulphite present			0
this product contains this ingredient which is artificial			0
' @entity0 's national marketing manager , @entity91 , told @entity28 that the company stood by their claims that ' there are no artificial colours , flavours or added @entity97 in any meals we prepare			2
' ' this has been verified by @entity101 , a global leader in food safety and quality , who acted as an independent auditor to ensure everything prepared by @entity0 was free of artificial colours , flavours or added @entity97 , ' ms @entity91 said			2
however dr @entity23 claims @entity0 has changed the wording in their advertisements - which stated ' there 's no.			1
. @entity6 in the meals we prepare ' - since the complaint was lodged with the @entity17 , saying : ' basically , they essentially pleaded guilty '			1
' in fact it 's hard to find any food product they have there that does n't contain @entity6 , ' dr @entity23 said			1
' by now they have changed it to say ' no added @entity6 ' … but any food chemist asked to analyse these foods would find @entity6 despite the lawyer 's trick			0
' in fact it 's hard to find any food product they have there that does n't contain @entity6 , ' dr @entity23 said ' it is our view that hydrolysed vegetable protein and yeast extract are artificial products in that protein is broken down , typically by boiling with hydrochloric acid , then neutralising the slurry with sodium hydroxide , resulting in high concentrations of the sodium cation and the glutamate anion			1
this is @entity6 by any chemical understanding			0
' @entity6 can be found in @entity149 roast chicken , chicken stuffing , chicken salt , gravy , chicken nuggets , combi salt , rosemary sprinkle , chip salt and most sauces , according to the @entity2 's complaint			2
' i 'd like them to stop making misleading and erroneous claims in their advertising and i 'd like them ideally remove more artificial substance form the food they 're selling , ' dr @entity41 said			1
@entity28 have contacted @entity0 for comment @entity0 has retaliated by arguing that they could accurately claim their meals were ' free of added @entity6 '			0
' we also note the comments today of professor @entity170 , a nutrition expert at the @entity171 , who confirmed we could accurately claim our meals are free of added @entity6 as glutamate , an amino acid , is found in all protein foods and our glutamate rises whenever we eat any protein , ' ms @entity91 said			0
' with regard to the suggestions that our canola oil is not 100 per cent @entity13 and our chicken nuggets are not preservative free , after reconfirming with our certifiers and suppliers in the past 24 hours we again reject these comments as inaccurate			0
' @entity0 has no record of any contact or complaint from the @entity2 , however we would be happy to sit down with their members to provide clarity around the issues they have raised and to correct some unfounded claims			2
