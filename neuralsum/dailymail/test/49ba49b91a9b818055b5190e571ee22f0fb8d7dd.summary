@entity0 spent two years in and out of mental institutions after a yellow fever vaccine when award - winning @entity3 foreign correspondent @entity0 walked into a clinic one afternoon to have a yellow fever vaccine , he was warned the possible side - effects could be dizzy spells and a headache			1
yet within 24 hours of having the jab , in april 2011 , @entity0 had been reduced to a sweating , shivering wreck , gripped by a fever so strong it took two weeks and a spell in hospital before his temperature was brought down			1
a shooting star , glimpsed from the balcony of his home , convinced @entity0 - who had no previous history of mental illness - that he was a modern - day @entity24			1
' i went completely bonkers , ' he says today			1
' the vaccine fried my brain			2
' @entity0 , 59 , who had the jab in preparation for an assignment in the @entity31 , believed his kindle could fly , that dead friends were contacting him and that he could stop traffic just by thinking about it			1
he spent the next two years in and out of mental institutions , unable to work - and even attempted suicide			1
fortunately , he has since made a full recovery			1
but @entity0 believes the yellow fever vaccine - available in @entity41 vaccination clinics , gp surgeries and even @entity43 - could have dangerous side - effects that affect more people than previously thought			1
since its invention in 1951 , more than 540 million doses of the vaccine have been given			2
anyone travelling to parts of @entity52 or @entity53 is advised to have it			0
yellow fever is a serious viral infection spread by mosquito bites			1
symptoms include fever , chills , loss of appetite and nausea			2
while many people recover after five or six days , 15 per cent enter a second , toxic phase , with recurring fever , abdominal pain , and jaundice due to liver damage			2
they may also start vomiting blood			0
this toxic phase is fatal in about 20 per cent of cases			0
clearly a dangerous illness , there is no doubt vaccination can be life - saving			0
but @entity0 and others who say they have been adversely affected by the jab want the manufacturer to investigate			1
@entity0 , who for many years was the @entity3 's man in @entity79 , had the jab in a clinic in @entity81 , where his family was living			1
next morning , his new wife @entity83 , found him downstairs , shivering and sweating , his face beetroot red			1
' i was beside myself with worry , ' says @entity83 , 55 , an author and journalist			0
' it was n't just the fever but the change in character			2
he became irrational , then emotional - crying			0
' when his fever showed no signs of relenting after five days , @entity83 took @entity0 to hospital			1
the doctors , who also discovered through blood tests that @entity0 had suffered recent liver damage , told him they believed he 'd had an adverse reaction to the vaccine			1
he believes the yellow fever vaccine could have dangerous side - effects they managed to lower his temperature			1
but his mental problems were only just beginning			2
formerly agnostic , @entity0 became convinced he was @entity107 , and two weeks after being admitted to hospital he was moved to a mental hospital and given anti-psychotic medication			1
it was a harrowing time for @entity112			0
' one day i visited him in hospital and he stripped off his clothes and asked me to turn the sheet into a nappy and put it on him so everyone could see he was @entity107 , ' she says			0
' doctors had told me not to upset him , just to do what he asked , so i did it			0
' after three weeks , @entity0 was discharged in may 2011 , and seemed to be recovering , so went back to work			1
but within weeks he deteriorated again			2
@entity0 developed full - blown psychosis , and over the following months moved between psychiatric hospitals in different countries - in the @entity128 , @entity79 , and eventually with money running out , in @entity112 's native @entity130			1
on one occasion he attempted to take his own life			2
happily , @entity0 was well enough to be discharged from hospital in july 2012 and has since made a full recovery			1
he is now pursuing the manufacturers of the vaccine , @entity137 , to admit liability for what happened to him			2
as @entity83 explains : ' every doctor we dealt with said they thought he 'd suffered an adverse reaction to the vaccine			0
since may 2011 i have been back to @entity137 many times , but they are refusing to do anything or even meet us			0
' @entity0 is not the only person who believes they have had an adverse reaction to the drug			2
he is in touch with 12 others who believe they , too , have suffered grave side - effects			0
the @entity155 says that up to three in ten people who are immunised with the yellow fever vaccine suffer a mild headache , muscle aches , mild fever or soreness at the injection site - and that these symptoms occur because your immune system is trying to fight the small dose of yellow fever you have been injected with			1
these symptoms may last for up to 14 days after the injection			0
it 's thought that far fewer people , four in a million , suffer more serious psychotic or neurological reactions , mainly unconnected to the symptoms of yellow fever itself			1
one of those is former royal naval commander @entity178 , who is convinced the jab , which he had in july 1999 , ruined his health			0
he still suffers bizarre attacks , with loss of vision , hearing impairment , vertigo and headaches ( posed by model ) a fortnight after being given the injection , @entity190 , now 56 , experienced terrible pains down his left side			0
he spent three weeks in @entity193 and another three in the @entity194 in @entity195 , @entity196			2
' no diagnosis was made , except that i had suffered a major neurological illness , ' says @entity190 , a father - of - two from @entity201			0
after three months at home convalescing , @entity190 - who had also been unable to move - finally got movement back in his limbs and the pain disappeared			0
but then began a series of debilitating attacks which continue to this day			0
' while now controlled by epilepsy medication , i still suffer bizarre attacks , with loss of vision , hearing impairment , vertigo and headaches , which occur sometimes daily or with gaps of several days or weeks , ' he says			0
' the most i have ever had is 19 in a single day			0
the stress and exhaustion from these attacks essentially stopped my career			0
i managed to hang on for ten years , but by 2010 , after 32 years in the @entity221 , i realised i was n't being fair on the team			0
' having struggled to accommodate the condition , while taking a staggering succession of medications and having constant tests , it finally beat me and i had to walk away from the career i loved			0
' @entity190 always mentioned to specialists that his symptoms seemed to have begun after he had the yellow fever jab and , consequently , he has been advised by medical professionals it 's likely that a vaccine caused the problem			1
but it was only after hearing about other cases such as @entity0 's that he decided to speak out			2
' surely the company that makes the vaccine has a moral duty to review it to see if it should be modified or replaced , ' says @entity190			0
as long ago as 2005 , dr @entity240 , a former @entity241 public health professor and world expert on yellow fever , confirmed that the vaccine can cause ' really severe and significant adverse events '			1
he told @entity245 : ' while we should not overlook the 60 years of wide use of yellow fever vaccine , with a remarkable record of safety and effective prevention of this terrible disease , rare and unusual adverse events temporally associated with vaccination may occur			1
some of these , such as the neuropsychiatric syndromes described in mr @entity0 's case , may not be acknowledged as causally related in the official literature			2
' the manufacturer , however , does not believe it needs to reassess the vaccine			0
in 2013 dr @entity260 , head of vaccination innovation at @entity137 , admitted to a conference that the vaccine had n't been reviewed in many years , saying it serves ' a small market , with very low returns , and there is not really an incentive to redevelop '			2
a spokesman told @entity245 that the company takes reports of adverse events ' very seriously ' and ensures they are investigated promptly , but ' after carefully examining all the medical information that has been disclosed to us up to april 2013 , we have been unable to establish any evidence for a causal relationship between the administration of the yellow fever vaccine @entity278 and mr @entity0 's reported medical condition			1
' the current state of scientific knowledge does not support that these reported symptoms could be biologically plausibly linked to the natural history of the disease , nor the mode of action of the vaccine			0
' similarly , the observation of an event after vaccination does not automatically mean that vaccination has caused this event			0
' @entity0 , who has written a book , @entity293 , wo n't be satisfied until the experiences of people like him are acknowledged in official literature about the vaccine and he has been offered compensation			1
' the vaccine almost destroyed me , ' @entity0 says			1
' i want justice for my family , and the hundreds of others whose lives have been ruined			0

@entity3 foreign correspondent @entity0 had a yellow fever vaccine
24 hours later he had been reduced to a sweating , shivering wreck
had a fever for two weeks then psychosis : ' i went completely bonkers '
spent two years in and out of mental institutions , unable to work
even attempted suicide , but has fortunately made a full recovery
