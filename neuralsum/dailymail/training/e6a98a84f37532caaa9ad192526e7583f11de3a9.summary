by @entity0 published : 10:56 est , 9 july 2012 updated : 10:56 est , 9 july 2012 a mother who developed cervical cancer and was left infertile after her smear test results were misread twice has been awarded £ 50,000 compensation			1
@entity5 , 37 , had two smear tests where pre-cancerous cells were present			1
however , she was n't called for follow - up appointments on either occasion			2
mrs @entity5 continued for the next four years thinking she was healthy but was horrified to be diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2009			1
by this stage it was too late to save her womb and she had to have a radical hysterectomy			0
@entity5 , pictured with her son @entity15			1
she went for regular smear tests but developed cervical cancer after they were misread the life - saving surgery was a success , but left the mother - of - one unable to have any more children			1
@entity23 has now admitted that the smear tests were not read properly and an independent medical expert said @entity0 ’s cancer could have been prevented			1
@entity0 , a letting agent , said : ' if they had spotted the cancer earlier i would not have lost my womb and could have more children now			1
' we wanted a big family and we were actually trying for another child when the cancer came			0
' basically the negligence of some people has had a dramatic effect on my life			1
i want to ensure that no - one else has to go through this			0
' mrs @entity5 , who lives with her husband @entity40 , 43 , and son @entity15 , eight , in @entity23 , had two smear tests at @entity23 in 2003 and 2005			1
the first test showed borderline changes , the second should have been read as abnormal and both should have resulted in follow - up appointments			2
@entity0 had another smear test in 2008 that again came back negative , but she felt something was wrong			1
she had been told by the hospital she could n't have another until september 2009 , but got one at her doctors in february			0
mrs @entity5 , who wanted a bigger family , was awarded £ 50,000 compensation after she had to have a hysterectomy luckily doctors caught her cervical cancer in time to save her life , but @entity0 had to endure an emergency radical hysterectomy , including lymph node removal , in march 2009 leaving her infertile			1
she said : ' i burst into tears when i found out i had cancer			0
' but the most scary thought ever is what could have happened if i had not asked for another test			2
i do n’t know what made me push for a test so much , but i am so glad i did			2
' the independent medical expert said if i had waited until september to have treatement i would have been dead as the tumours were growing			1
' an independent cytopathologist who reviewed @entity0 ’s case said if the abnormal cells had been picked up on her 2003 or 2005 scans she could have been treated with a cone biopsey and she would have kept her womb			0
@entity0 ’s solicitor @entity79 , from @entity80 , said : ' @entity82 smear showed borderline changes and should have resulted in a colposcopy referral for a detailed investigation			2
' her 2005 smear result was abnormal , again showing glandular neoplasia , and @entity0 should have had an urgent colposcopy referal			2
' our independent cytopathologist said they should have done a cone biopsey to remove the abnormal , pre-cancerous , cells if the tests had been read correctly			0
' if they had read the results right in first place she would not have gone on to develop the cancer and avoided the hysterectomy			0
' a spokesman for @entity23 said they were truly sorry for their errors he added : ' the lesson for hospitals is to be very careful to keep on top of results and ensure there are regular audits			0
' @entity23 have now sent @entity0 a letter of apology and reviewed its policy			0
a hospital spokesman said : ' we accept that , regrettably , those smears were incorrectly reported and that this may have contributed to a delayed diagnosis of glandular neoplasia ( abnormalities of glandular cells )			0
' we are truly sorry for those errors			0
we carry out thousands of cervical smear tests annually , and we would like to reassure all our patients that this is a most exceptional case			2
' we are determined to learn from it and we have reviewed our procedures to ensure there is no recurrence of the failings experienced by @entity131			0

mrs @entity5 *insisted* on another smear test seven *months* earlier than her appointment , saving her own life according to a medical expert
