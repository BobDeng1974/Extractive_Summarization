@entity11 researchers have developed a new technique using bright colours to show the spread of aquatic plants in lakes , and say it reveals a key indicator of the effect of climate change - and can be used to quickly analyse satellite images from around the globe			1
currently , divers have to make visual inspections to spot ‘ invading ’ plants which flourish due to changing temperatures			1
with the help of aerial images - such as this one showing the western shore of @entity28 - scientists are able to track the spread of certain aquatic plants			2
this information sheds light on the quality of the water ( blue - bare sediment ; green and yellow - sparse vegetation ; dark red - dense vegetation ) for instance , @entity41 and @entity42 marina , better known as western waterweed and spiny naiad , have been spreading rapidly in @entity11 water bodies in recent years			1
ecologists are able to use them as indicator plants			0
their proliferation allows researchers to draw conclusions on water quality – @entity41 and @entity53 are particularly common in lakes with rising water temperatures			2
the rapid spread of such plants over a wide area can upset the balance of sensitive lake ecosystems			0
now researchers at the @entity62 have written software that can spot the invading plants from space			1
‘ this new idea involves replacing some of the diving effort with high - resolution aerial and satellite images , ’ said project supervisor dr. @entity66			0

@entity41 and @entity53 ( pictured ) are particularly common in lakes with rising water temperatures			0
the rapid spread of such plants over a wide area can upset the balance of sensitive lake ecosystems ‘ in order to draw conclusions on plant growth from the imagery produced , we measure reflectance			1
‘ each plant species reflects the incident light in a specific way , depending on its pigmentation and structure			1
' the team found every lake has its own reflectance characteristics and they have created a library of plants			0
‘ it took us two years to photograph the plants from a boat and measure their reflectance , ’ said doctoral student @entity106			2
the scientists use cameras and sensors to photograph plant populations from a boat ( left ) and then measure the reflectance spectra of submerged plants			2
the camera ( right ) is attached to the end of the extension arm to eliminate shadow over the photographed areas			0

currently , divers have to make visual inspections to spot ‘ invading ’ plants such as western waterweed that flourishes due to changing temperatures
scientists of @entity62 have written software than can spot invading plants from space
the @entity11 researchers measure reflectance of various plant species that reflect light in different ways to glean information about climate change
