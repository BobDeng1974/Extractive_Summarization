by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 is predicting a third - round knockout of @entity4 in their mega rematch at @entity7 on saturday week , not another controversial ending to their @entity9 for the world super middleweight title			1
the 25 - year - old @entity13 remains supremely confident that he will end the reign of the @entity15 , so much so that he is in dispute with his own bullish trainer as to how soon he will inflict the stoppage			0
@entity2 said : ‘ i ca n’t see it going longer than three rounds , but @entity21 thinks @entity4 will last until the fifth			1
he may try to take it as long as possible in the false belief that i will blow up in the later rounds			0
’ @entity2 was ahead on the scorecard , having floored @entity4 with a massive right hand in the first round in @entity35 last november , before referee @entity36 declared a hasty stoppage in the champion ’s favour in the ninth			1
and @entity2 says : ‘ to tell you the truth i was in better physical condition than @entity4 at that point , even though he did enjoy some success in that round			1
‘ i had been giving him the beating of his life and he was in more trouble than me			0
‘ there will be no escape this time			2
we will have neutral officials ( the referee remains a matter of dispute ) so i wo n’t be a victim of the myths that i ’m chinny and short on stamina			0
’ shock to the system : @entity2 floored @entity4 with a massive right in the first round of their first fight as well as increasing his workrate with @entity69 he has brought in a physical conditioning expert for the first time			1
of his improvement under @entity73 , as well the result of his extended period in camp with @entity69 , he says : ‘ @entity4 thinks i ’m not a 12 - round fighter but it ’s so different in the gym this time			1
i ’m going 15 - 20 rounds in sparring and it ’s effortless			0
i ’ve never done that before but this time , with the same good sparring partners , i ’m finding it much easier			0
’ although his new promoters , the @entity86 giants @entity87 , have no official role for @entity7 , @entity2 is taking their counsel as to who should replace @entity92 , the referee who has been vetoed by @entity4 and his promoter @entity93			1
controversial : the first fight was ended by referee @entity36 in the ninth round to much surprise he suspects that @entity92 may be too strict for the taste of the @entity4 camp , saying : ‘ there is some evidence that @entity4 is being advised by his trainer ( @entity101 ) to rabbit punch			1
it seemed like it happened in his big fight with @entity108			0
since the change in the referee we think it ’s best to draw attention to that			0
all i want is a fair neutral			0
’ @entity4 does not have a reputation for foul play and the @entity108 fight in the final of the @entity119 super welterweight series remains one of his only two defeats			2
such is @entity2 ' confidence that he insists : ‘ not only am i going to knock @entity4 out but i would beat every other super middleweight in the world			2
that includes @entity108 even though he would be tougher than @entity4			2

@entity2 claims he will knockout @entity4 in the third round
@entity4 won the first @entity9 after the fight was stopped in the ninth
@entity2 has told @entity4 : ' there will be no escape this time '
@entity2 has *teamed* up with @entity86 promoters @entity87
