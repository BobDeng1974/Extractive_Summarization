@entity1 's big - screen adaptation of @entity2 this year brought the glamour of jazz age @entity4 gloriously to life			1
audiences were dazzled by the bright lights of @entity9 and the palatial mansions of @entity11			2
however , as these pictures demonstrate , much of what was shown was pure cinematic trickery			0
they reveal how , with help from modern technology , a few cars and a group of actors were translated into a teeming metropolitan scene , and how an almost empty field became a sumptuous formal garden			0
the stills , released by visual effect supervisor @entity25 , reveal that many of the movie ’s most spectacular scenes were , in fact , shot with nothing but a series of blue and green screens in the background			1
taxi to nowhere : bustling @entity36 was actually created with just a few green screens and less than a dozen cars talking to himself : @entity40 , played by @entity41 , is seen with friend @entity2 , played by @entity43 , in front of @entity45 - but in reality it was little more than a blue screen the vanishing mansion : the horseman is real enough , but the sumptuous estate and perfectly manicured gardens are a @entity54 sleight of hand the technique — known as chroma key — is used in tv weather reports to create the illusion of the forecaster standing before an animated map , which is then overlaid on the screen			1
today , thanks to innovations in computer - generated imagery ( @entity54 ) , backdrops can be created from scratch with the help of 3d modelling programmes similar to those used by architects designing a building			1
impressive as it may be , the method is not without its flaws			0
shooting before a screen means that actors must avoid wearing clothes that match it , because everything of that colour will automatically be replaced by background footage			0
for all that , chroma key allows directors to take their audiences on dazzling flights of fancy			0
indeed , those who have seen the new film version of @entity89 ’s novel ( there was a 1974 version with @entity92 ) would struggle to guess that most of @entity2 was shot not in @entity93 , where @entity89 ’s tale is set , but in @entity1 ’s native @entity95			2
all that jazz : a car full of revellers on the @entity99 was seen in the film ... but all the scenery was added later dream home : the palatial mansion home of @entity40 's lover @entity104 was conjured up by computer magic the wheel deal : @entity40 's flamboyant 1929 yellow @entity107 actually roared around a car park - not the streets of @entity110			2

dazzling scenery in @entity1 film was actually created with the help of green and blue screens and @entity54
computer trickery made realistic depiction of bustling 1930s @entity9 possible with little on *location* filming
