a litter of @entity1 whose mother was deemed unfit to care for them has gotten some help from a very unlikely source			2
@entity6 , a golden retriever , is now a surrogate mother to the pups , who were born at the @entity10			1
@entity6 , who gave birth to her own puppy recently , is not only helping by feeding the pups , but also teaching them social skills			2
' this is a positive for both @entity6 ’s offspring and the @entity34 wild dogs , as they will benefit from initial socialization with a canine species			0
' @entity6 is a retired search and rescue dog that the zoo found after an exhaustive search			1
who lives in @entity49 , @entity50			0
the puppies , two female and one male , were born on friday , but their mother , @entity52 , showed a lack of maternal care			2
@entity55 time : @entity6 cleans the pups as she enters a cage at the zoo feeding time : @entity6 cares for her own puppy while caring for the @entity22 , even nursing them together ' in preparation for this birth , we have been monitoring @entity66 by video			1
we know that she is an unproven mother and wanted to be ready to intervene if necessary , ' said @entity69 , animal curator			0
' we are hopeful that these dogs will thrive in @entity6 's care and when they reach an appropriate age for socialization we will be able to successfully reintroduce them to their pack			0
' important birth : the @entity22 are incredibly valued by the zoo as their population has decreased drastically over the past few years , with less than 7,000 adults the staff at the zoo is very excited for the new pups as the number @entity22 in the world have been decreasing drastically over the years , and the zoo has not had any newborns since 1997			1
currently , there are less than 7,000 adult dogs , with their population declining as a result of disease and loss of habitat .			0

a litter of @entity22 born at the @entity10 were in need of a surrogate mother when their own mother showed no maternal instincts
the zoo launched a search to find a capable dog to serve as a surrogate and luckily *located* @entity6 , a retired search and rescue dog who had just given birth
now @entity6 nurses her new puppy and the three @entity22 at the zoo
the population of @entity22 has been drastically decreasing , with less than 7,000 adults in the wild , making this birth very important
