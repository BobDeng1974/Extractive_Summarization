‘ what you ’re going to see is me avoiding the mistakes of @entity17 chancellors before elections with unfunded giveaways that lead to economic problems after the election , ’ he said			2
a report out today warns that the government will have to borrow £ 9billion more than expected this year as tax receipts disappoint			1
this means the chancellor will not be able to deliver the budget surplus he has promised until 2019 - 20 – a year late			2
and it casts doubt on his plans for £ 7billion of tax cuts for the middle classes after the election			0
‘ the improvement in the public finances is in danger of not just stalling but going into reverse , ’ says @entity34 in the report for the @entity36			2
‘ with the fiscal cupboard bare , the chancellor will have little room for manoeuvre			0
’ mr @entity6 can expect a boost from the @entity46 this week with an upward revision of economic growth forecasts			0
but the @entity36 warns ‘ that ’s where the good news is likely to end ’ as subdued wage growth and the big increase in the tax free allowance to £ 10,500 hits tax receipts			1
borrowing hit a record high of £ 153billion in 2009 - 10 as the last @entity17 government lost control of the public finances in the @entity60			1
the deficit fell to £ 97.5billion last year but progress has stalled and the government borrowed £ 64.1billion in the first seven months of this fiscal year			0
that is £ 3.7billion more than in the equivalent period of 2013 - 14			0
the increase in borrowing means the chancellor will struggle to meet his target of cutting the deficit by another £ 11billion this year – with the @entity36 expecting it to come in at £ 95.5billion			0
‘ with just five months to go it appears virtually impossible for the government to achieve the @entity46 ’s current forecast for borrowing in 2014 - 15 , ’ mr @entity34 said			1

depressed pay combined with soaring housing costs and the failure to tackle the causes of increased welfare bills , means tax receipts have fallen short by £ 66 billion , national insurance contributions are £ 25.5billion lower than expected and spending on social security is £ 25billion higher than planned			2
‘ for all the government ’s boasts about a belated economic recovery , there are millions of families still caught in the most prolonged cost - of - living crisis for a century			1
for them this is a joyless and payless recovery , ’ mr @entity74 will say			2
but mr @entity6 told the @entity101 : ‘ we ’ve created more jobs in this country under this government than the rest of @entity106 put together			0
‘ we ’ve had the fastest fall in unemployment in this country ’s history			0
so those are real outcomes for real people			0
‘ we should n’t face this false choice of either bankrupting the country or having decent public services			0
