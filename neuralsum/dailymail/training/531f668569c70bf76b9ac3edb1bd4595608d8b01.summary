i 've been caught up in lighthouses and blown by the wind and rain but generally take safety first when dealing with the weather			0
' originally from @entity23 , @entity7 left his it job a decade ago and moved to @entity15 to start a new life with his wife @entity38			1
although his day job includes working at one of @entity15 's biggest mining companies in @entity2 , he spends his weekends focusing on his real passion , photography			1
' it was probably the closest call i 've had with lightning ' @entity7 said of his encounter with the storm @entity7 likes to take on landscape photographs from a fresh approach , like with this sunset over @entity52 by day he works for one of the city 's biggest mining companies , but his real passion lies in photography the storm images , which show bright bolts of lighting splitting the sky in half were shot on a @entity64 5d @entity63 with a @entity64 24 - 105 f / 4 lens			1
' everybody has a camera these days especially smart phone cameras so people are getting less and less impressed with landscape photos , ' @entity7 said			0
' but the ones where @entity26 puts on a show like she did that morning has earned me nothing but wonderful feedback			0
' @entity7 ditched the @entity23 after 31 years for a rather large sea change and to escape the working grind , but it is the stormy weather that is giving him the best opportunities to practice his calling			2

' the only problem with great scenery is that there are thousands of people getting the same shots over and over again of the same locations - with storms there is never two photos the same			0
' @entity104 never will create the same patterns from one bolt to the next and clouds are always different in shape , size and colour which adds so much drama to any landscape , ' @entity7 added			0
