by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 and @entity3 have been named in an @entity5 one - day squad laden with experience to take on @entity7 ahead of the @entity8			2
@entity9 exclusively revealed the 16 - man squad @entity5 will take to the sub-continent which is heavily reliant on the tried and trusted with @entity11 in charge			2
there is no place for @entity16 ’s big - hitting @entity15 , who @entity5 believe is not yet ready for 50 - over international cricket , but there are reprieves for @entity2 and @entity3 who both missed out on the 3 - 1 one - day series defeat by @entity23			1
@entity2 will be handed a late @entity8 opportunity when named in the @entity26 squad to face @entity7 probable squad for @entity7 : @entity11 ( capt ) , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity3 , @entity32 ( wkt ) , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity2 , @entity40 , @entity41			0
the unlucky @entity2 has been consistently overlooked but is finally rewarded for prolific runscoring for @entity43 , particularly in limited - overs cricket , while @entity3 is welcomed back after his controversial omission			0
@entity31 , despite only three hundreds in 148 one - day internationals , makes the cut for a seven - match series in @entity7 that will provide testing preparation for @entity5 in november and december ahead of february ’s @entity8			1
the retention of @entity11 as captain was far less certain in one - day cricket than for the test arena but the vote of confidence from the selectors now is confirmation of their desire for him to lead @entity5 in the @entity8			1
@entity3 ( pictured playing for @entity61 in the @entity62 on wednesday ) will also be included @entity11 will lead @entity5 at next year 's @entity8 in @entity63 and @entity64 @entity37 's form in the 50 - over game has been a source of concern for the @entity5 selectors @entity31 has made the cut despite scoring just three hundreds in 148 one - day internationals @entity11 has his detractors in limited - overs cricket but the fact remains that he has five one - day hundreds , is one of the top 10 runscorers in world 50 - over cricket since the last @entity8 and has a strike - rate as captain comparable to @entity82 ’s			1
he has silenced doubters before and is determined to do so again , as he told @entity9 in an exclusive interview where he said he would be ' devastated ' to miss out now , before almost certainly handing over the one - day reins after the @entity8			0
the difficulties encountered by @entity35 on his step up to 50 - over international cricket against @entity23 , where he was quickly worked out by @entity91 seamers using two new white balls , convinced the selectors that there is still more chance of test - class batsmen in @entity11 and @entity31 scoring centuries than an exciting @entity99 rookie like @entity15			2
there have been more concerns among the selectors about @entity37 ’s form than @entity11 ’s but he made a welcome return to something close to his best in the @entity99 international that finished the international season			0
@entity37 remains a key figure if @entity5 are going to upset the odds and compete for their long overdue first @entity8 title , something they have not come even close to since losing the 1992 final to @entity111 in @entity112			0
@entity5 have under - achieved in limited - overs cricket for much of the 22 years since but they did briefly reach the top of the world one - day standings two years ago and reached the final of last year ’s @entity116 under @entity11 ’s captaincy and using the traditional one - day methods they continue to advocate now			2
that means they will look to the likes of @entity11 , @entity31 and @entity38 to provide the anchor role and try to bat throughout the innings , leaving wickets in hand for @entity37 , @entity3 and @entity32 to explode in the final overs			0
there have been selectorial concerns over the one - dimensional nature of @entity34 but he survives now in a largely unchanged bowling attack because of coach @entity132 preference for a left - armer and with there being few viable alternatives			0
the @entity136 , which will be based in @entity7 at the same time as the one - day series , will provide @entity15 with one last chance to stake his claim but time is running out for him and other aspirants to gatecrash @entity5 ’s @entity8 party			1
@entity16 's big - hitting @entity15 looks set to miss the cut as @entity5 do n't believe he 's ready for 50 - over cricket			1

@entity11 will lead @entity5 for the one - day series starting in november
big - hitting @entity16 opener @entity15 not given a chance
@entity31 makes the cut with @entity152 set to miss out
