tanning really could be an addiction , and a sign of at least two major psychological issues , scientists have warned			1
while followers such as ' tanning mom ' and the cast of @entity8 continue to hit the salons , researchers say they could actually have a serious problem they found some who engage in excessive tanning may also be suffering from obsessive - compulsive ( @entity13 ) and body dysmorphic disorders ( @entity15 )			1
@entity17 fans : the cast of @entity8 are known for their deep colouring - now researchers have called for more research into tanning addiction			1
the tanning test the researchers developed is a modified version of substance abuse criteria provided by the 4th edition of the @entity27			2
those who answered yes to two of the four questions on the tanning - specific version of the @entity35 alcohol screener were considered to have problematic tanning			2
out of 533 tanning @entity38 students who took the questionnaire , 31 percent met the criteria for tanning dependence and 12 percent for problematic tanning			0
in further analysis , being female and screening positive for body dysmorphic disorder and @entity13 were significantly associated with tanning dependence			1
' tanning mom ' , the ultra-bronzed mother - of - five , 44 , whose real name is @entity46 , hit headlines last april when she was arrested for taking her then five - year - old daughter , @entity49 , into a tanning booth			2
now it appears she could suffer from serious issues			0
the new research from @entity54 , a @entity56 student in psychology , and dr. @entity58 , an assistant professor of psychiatry at the @entity60 and a @entity38 alumna , shows that some who engage in excessive tanning may also be suffering from obsessive - compulsive ( @entity13 ) and body dysmorphic disorders ( @entity15 )			1
@entity54 and @entity58 also looked at whether tanning should be classified as an addiction			2
' while more research is needed regarding to idea of tanning as an addiction , this study suggests that some people who tan also experience mental health symptoms that warrant further assessment , ' said @entity58			1
' although tanning behavior could be separate and distinct from these concerns , it ’s possible that the symptoms of @entity13 or @entity15 are contributing to the tanning in some way			1
' for these people , prevention messages and public health campaigns may not be as helpful , but further assessment and treatment could be			0
' their paper , ' @entity85 and @entity87 : further evaluation of @entity89 and @entity90 , ' is currently in press in the @entity92 and will be published later this year			0
respondents who answered yes to at least three of the eight criteria on the @entity95 were considered tanning dependent			0
tanning mom @entity46 : researchers say those suffering from tanning addiction could suffer may also be suffering from obsessive - compulsive ( @entity13 ) and body dysmorphic disorders ( @entity15 ) the @entity95 is a modified version of substance abuse criteria provided by the 4th edition of the @entity27			1
those who answered yes to two of the four questions on the tanning - specific version of the @entity35 alcohol screener were considered to have problematic tanning			2
out of 533 tanning @entity38 students who took the questionnaire , 31 percent met the criteria for tanning dependence and 12 percent for problematic tanning			0
in further analysis , being female and screening positive for body dysmorphic disorder and @entity13 were significantly associated with tanning dependence			1
in the model for problematic tanning , only screening positive for obsessive - compulsive disorder was significantly related			1
' it may be that some individuals in our sample engage in excessive tanning because of obsessive thoughts about , or the compulsion to tan , or because tanning is a strategy for relaxation to decrease ocd symptoms , ' explained @entity54			2
' if problem tanning is conceptualized as an addictive disorder , obsessions and compulsions about tanning may instead represent craving to tan			0
' the odds of meeting the screening criteria for problematic tanning and tanning dependence was strongest for participants who tanned at least nine times in the past 30 days			0
tanning could be a real addiction , the team say ' we have tanning addiction in the title , but we do n’t jump to the conclusion automatically that tanning is and can be an addiction , ' @entity54 said			0
' we ’re saying that we should n’t necessarily rule this out especially if people are tanning excessively , even if they are n’t experiencing any ocd or body dysmorphic disorder			1
' because of this problem we should look at the potential for tanning addiction more			0
' ' we see this as more potential evidence and firepower for continuing to research the conceptualizing of excessive tanning as an addiction , ' @entity54 said			1
' previously , clinicians educated patients on the harms of tanning			0
' it ’s probably more than that – most people know there are harms , but they continue to do it			0
' we need to be more focused on intervention than just telling people it ’s bad for them			0
