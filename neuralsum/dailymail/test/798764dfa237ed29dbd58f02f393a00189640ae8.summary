the title race appears to be over , but what about the fight to stay in the @entity3 ? no one is dead and buried and even @entity5 in 15th are a bad weekend away from falling into the relegation zone			1
it ’s extremely close with the delightful benefit that there will be five key fixtures between sides in the bottom six			2
have @entity13 got enough breathing room to survive what looks like the hardest run - in ? are @entity17 too far back ? @entity18 have been dealt a reasonable hand but can they capitalise ? have @entity20 improved enough away from home to take any confidence to @entity17 on the final day ? @entity23 considers the possibilities and delivers a verdict			1
@entity5 position : 15th on 29 points @entity28 ( centre ) reinvigorated @entity5 with a stunning strike to beat rivals @entity31 1 - 0 @entity33 is overseeing @entity5 's survival bid as manager until the end of the season seven points split @entity5 in 15th and @entity17 in 20th as the battle for @entity3 survival heats up predicted results : five points from seven games @entity44 ( @entity45 ) - @entity46 @entity47 ( a ) - @entity46 @entity48 ( @entity45 ) - l @entity49 ( a ) - l @entity17 ( @entity45 ) - w @entity50 ( a ) - l @entity51 ( a ) l predicted total : 34 points verdict : safe their derby win will have done them the world of good , as will the relative comfort of facing three teams in @entity44 , @entity47 and @entity49 who have very little to play for			1
they need to make the most of those initial fixtures because it ’s highly unlikely that they will get anything out of closing trips to @entity50 and @entity51			2
@entity69 position : 16th on 29 points @entity72 scored a hat - trick as @entity69 drew 3 - 3 against @entity20 on tuesday @entity74 has helped @entity69 rediscover their scoring touch since replacing @entity76 as manager predicted results : seven points from six games @entity81 ( a ) - l @entity82 ( a ) - l @entity49 ( @entity45 ) - @entity46 @entity83 ( @entity45 ) - w @entity48 ( a ) - l @entity18 ( @entity45 ) - w predicted total : 36 points verdict : safe at this stage of the season and in these circumstances you want winnable home games and that is what @entity69 have			1
however , with only three home wins this season ( one less than on the road ) they face a challenge			0
they ought to be ok , not least because a team that struggled to score under @entity76 has improved under @entity74			0
@entity13 position : 17th on 28 points @entity102 's @entity13 are placed perilously above the drop zone in 17th with seven games remaining @entity106 will be a key man in @entity13 's bid to protect their position outside of the relegation zone predicted results : five points from seven games @entity48 ( a ) - l @entity112 ( @entity45 ) - @entity46 @entity44 ( a ) - @entity46 @entity50 ( @entity45 ) - l @entity18 ( @entity45 ) - w @entity81 ( a ) - l @entity113 ( @entity45 ) - l predicted total : 33 points verdict : safe			1
the hardest run - in of the lot ? it looks that way and therefore they could cut it awfully fine with regards to survival			0
there are two points between them and @entity20 at the moment , but @entity13 could have a potentially decisive advantage in the form of their goal difference , which is six better than @entity20 ’s			1
their fixtures are simply awful			0
@entity44 are isolated on that list as a team without major incentive			0
@entity20 position : 18th on 26 points @entity136 has netted 17 goals in 29 games for @entity20 and will be vital during his team 's difficult run - in @entity141 may find @entity20 's goal difference a big disadvantage , particularly with a tough final seven games predicted results : seven points from six games @entity51 ( @entity45 ) - l @entity83 ( @entity45 ) - w @entity112 ( a ) - l @entity82 ( a ) - l @entity31 ( @entity45 ) - w @entity17 ( a ) - @entity46 predicted total : 33 points verdict : relegated on goal difference three brutally hard fixtures with perhaps a mixed blessing that @entity112 and @entity82 – games you would expect them to lose anywhere – are played away			1
that places huge emphasis on home games against @entity83 and @entity31 , neither of whom are in form nor have much to play for			2
it could all come down to the final game of the season , which is away at @entity17			2
@entity141 has improved their away form but it is a big ask			0
their poor goal difference in relation to @entity13 ’s could be the deciding factor			0
@entity18 position : 19th on 26 points @entity173 will spearhead @entity18 's attack as they attempt to escape the @entity3 relegation zone @entity177 's side have two relegation crunch matches away from home against @entity13 and @entity69 predicted results : six points from seven games @entity50 ( @entity45 ) – l @entity49 ( a ) - @entity46 @entity17 ( @entity45 ) – @entity183 @entity83 ( a ) - @entity46 @entity13 ( a ) - l @entity47 ( @entity45 ) - @entity46 @entity69 ( a ) - l predicted total : 32 points verdict : relegated on paper they probably have the most straightforward opponents , but have the misfortune of playing two of their most critical fixtures – against @entity13 and @entity69 – away from @entity193			1
they have won only once away all season so it would be extremely ambitious to expect them to make hay now , considering four of those seven fixtures are on the road			0
would expect their status to be decided by the final two games			0
@entity17 position : 20th on 22 points @entity205 celebrates after an impressive display helped @entity17 beat @entity83 2 - 1 on saturday @entity207 ( left ) has eight games remaining to get @entity17 safe and has five home games to play predicted results : four points from eight games @entity212 ( a ) - l @entity213 ( @entity45 ) - @entity46 @entity18 ( a ) - l @entity51 ( @entity45 ) - l @entity31 ( @entity45 ) - @entity46 @entity48 ( @entity45 ) - @entity46 @entity5 ( a ) - l @entity20 ( @entity45 ) - @entity46 predicted total : 26 points verdict : relegated as with @entity18 , it ’s not the most intimidating run - in and they do have the most games from which to gain points			1
they also have the slight advantage of five fixtures at home			0
but 22 points from 30 games so far offers little indication that they will mount any kind of sprint for the line .			2

six teams are *embroiled* in a close battle to avoid the @entity3 drop
seven points split 20th placed @entity17 with @entity5 in 15th
@entity69 play @entity18 on the last day as @entity20 host @entity17
