a council made an embarrassing error when it installed a plaque commemorating a visit to a town by @entity5 in 1663 - despite the fact he was executed 14 years earlier			1
@entity8 erected the blue plaque at the governor 's tree half way between @entity12 and @entity13 after a previous one was stolen			1
but they made a mistake with the date as @entity19 i was beheaded for treason on january 30 , 1649 - and had actually visited the spot in 1633			1
can you spot the mistake ? @entity8 made an error when it installed this plaque the next month the monarchy was abolished and @entity27 came to power			1
the governor 's tree is a traditional boundary between @entity12 and @entity13 in @entity8			2
the exact wording of the plaque reads : ' @entity34			0
site of the @entity34 , where important visitors to @entity13 were met as they disembarked in @entity37			0
' these visitors included @entity5 in 1663 and @entity39 's commissioners , when they came to dispossess the monks of @entity41 in 1539			1
' a spokesman for @entity8 said : ' we are aware of the error in the date on the plaque and have already arranged for this to be corrected			2
' the governor 's tree pictured here is a traditional boundary between @entity12 and @entity13 in @entity8 off with his head : @entity5 was beheaded for treason on january 30 , 1649			1
the king is pictured here by sir @entity55 @entity19 's reign ended after civil war broke out in 1642 and although his @entity61 army had the upper hand at first , the king 's advantage did not last for long			0
by may 1646 , @entity19 surrendered			0
@entity19 's fate was sealed outside @entity64 in @entity65 , @entity66			0
the assembled crowd is reported to have groaned as the axe came down			0
although the monarchy was later restored in 1660 , the execution of @entity5 destroyed the idea of an all - powerful and unquestionable monarch .			2
