a 63 - year - old former air hostess has won a £ 14.5m @entity2 mansion from her ' immensely wealthy ' 90 - year - old @entity4 ex-husband following a legal battle based on a @entity7 law			1
the property , in north west @entity2 , which has ' superb views ' over a @entity2 park , was one of five properties which the successful property developer bought during the couple 's 14 - year marriage			1
the couple 's main marital home had been a £ 26m ' palatial residence ' in @entity19 , @entity4 , for which 40 members of staff were employed to keep it ticking over			1
a 63 - year - old former air hostess has won a £ 14.5m @entity2 mansion from her ' immensely wealthy ' 90 - year - old @entity4 ex-husband following a legal battle at the @entity26 ( pictured ) but , after their divorce , the woman - who did not have any financial input into the properties - moved into the townhouse , claiming her right to live there as one of their matrimonial homes			1
despite her husband 's attempts to evict her from the home , and force the sale of the heavily - mortgaged property , the wife has now been allowed to keep it as part of a complex legal settlement			1
the ' opulent ' maisonette - which was originally three flats converted into one large home - was at one point worth £ 22m , but is now worth a ' disappointing ' £ 14.5m , the court heard			1
the husband , who is said to be worth £ 600m and blows up to £ 10m per year , was also made to give his wife their ' holiday ' property in @entity57 , which is worth 17m euros			1
the judgment , made at the high court , was based on the woman 's claim to a right to marital property under the 1882 @entity64			0
the judge ruled that she should be awarded around £ 10m on a ' needs light ' basis			1
that was based on £ 3.5m for @entity2 housing , £ 2.25 million for a replacement holiday home and a further £ 500,000 to cover the outgoings on both properties			1
the court heard that both homes had significant mortgages , meaning they would have respective equities of £ 3.5m and £ 5.2m if they are sold			1
but the judge refused to grant the woman the £ 205,014 she was seeking annually to spend on jewellery , handbags and cars			1
the woman had claimed she needed £ 566,045 per year for her £ 75,000 wardrobe , as well as £ 25,000 to spend on jewellery			1
she also needed £ 25,000 for shoes and another £ 25,000 for handbags and accessories , she claimed			2
the couple married in the @entity88 ( pictured ) in 1979 when the man , a property developer , was in his mid- 50s and the woman was in her late 20s			2
they divorced twice , once in 2002 and once in 2013 the judge recognised that the woman 's standard of living had been ' lavish and exceptional ' during the marriage but said that it was ' not reasonable ' to expect that to continue			2
he added : ' if the wife exceeds this figure , she will have only herself to blame			0
' the judge also pointed out that , had it been an entirely @entity102 case , the woman would have been entitled to £ 44million - the figure she originally sought - out of total £ 287.5million in assets			1
he said that even though she was ' clearly not a lady of business ' , she was the homemaker and mother , which made her contribution to the marriage equal to her husband			0
' the authorities make it clear that she is not to be discriminated against for the way in which the parties organised their respective roles , ' he said			0
the woman , from @entity117 , took the legal action against the businessman at the @entity26 in @entity2			1
had the same case been heard in @entity4 , the woman would have been entitled to all but nothing			0
the couple married at the @entity88 in 1979 when the man was in his mid 50s and the woman was in her late 20s			2
they divorced in 1999 , before remarrying in 2002			0
they then separated again in 2013 , before divorcing in @entity4			0
the court heard that the main marital home had been in @entity4 , where her rights would have been very different			2
but she was allowed to bring the case in @entity2 because the family had spent most summers during their marriage in the capital to escape the ' intolerable ' @entity4 heat , making it one of their matrimonial homes			1
their children had also gone to nursery here during the holidays and the woman had lived here for at least one year when the case was brought			0
the court heard the husband owned properties in @entity150 , which sold for 15million euros in 2013 , and @entity151 , which sold for $ 15.5m			2
his wife had kept the profit from the @entity150 flat , he said			0
details of the case emerged in a ruling by mr @entity158 following a hearing in the @entity26 of the @entity26 in november			0
the row broke out when the pair were reunited in 2002 , with the wife alleging that her husband had promised to transfer her some of his properties			2
the court heard that the husband , said to be a member of several @entity2 clubs , had indeed transferred different properties to other members of his family , including his wife			1
but the judge rejected the claim that he would have promised to transfer his wife any properties for any other reason than tax , insisting he was still the ' beneficial owner ' of the property			1
he said : ' it is inherently improbable			0
he is a @entity4 businessman with great stature			0
i can not conceive that he would willingly part with all his residential property			0
why should he ? he had no intention of losing control of his various residential properties			0
' the judge also found that the wife had ' embellished and altered her recollection to suit her case '			2
the @entity64 was an act that significantly altered @entity102 law regarding the property rights of married women			0
among the laws it introduced , it allowed married women to own and control property in their own right			0
it came following an 1836 @entity198 court case which highlighted the injustice of @entity102 property laws , and generated enough support that eventually resulted in the @entity64			0
many of the elements have since been superseded by subsequent family law statutes .			0

@entity206 in @entity2 was one of five properties the man - worth £ 600m - owned
their main home was £ 26m ' palatial ' mansion in @entity19 , which had 40 staff
wife now given homes in @entity2 and @entity57 as part of legal settlement
but judge refused to give woman the £ 205,000 she wanted to spend on jewellery , handbags and cars
