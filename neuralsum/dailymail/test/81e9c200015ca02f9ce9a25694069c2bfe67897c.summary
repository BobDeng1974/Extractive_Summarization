a restaurant manager feared huge debts after forking out £ 2,000 on a bizarre addiction which meant he had to wear new underpants every day			1
@entity5 , 26 , from @entity6 , spent at least £ 40 a week buying new @entity8 boxers so that he could slip into a new ' crisp pair ' every day of the week			1
but after wiping out most of his savings , mr @entity5 realised that it was ' bankruptcy or boxers ' - and that he needed to wean himself off his addiction			1
he said : ' when i first started wearing new boxers every day , i loved it			1
i treated myself to really nice @entity8 ones			2
it always felt great to slip into a crisp pair			1
' it got to the point where i did n't feel comfortable unless i was wearing a new pair			2
' but , eventually , my money started to run out and i had to buy budget ones instead			0
finally , when a huge bill came in one day , i looked at finances and realised that i was spending all my savings on underpants			0
so i managed to wean myself off the compulsion			0
' during his year - long addiction , mr @entity5 bought 365 pairs of new boxers - which were then thrown into the bin after just one wear			1
he said his bizarre habit began after the breakdown of a relationship			0
' crisp pair ' : during his year - long addiction , mr @entity5 bought some 365 pairs of new boxers - and threw most pairs into the bin after just one wear whenever they stayed over , they would wear the same underwear for several days running , which he thought was ' disgusting '			1
so , in a bid to get over his former partner , mr @entity5 started wearing a fresh pair every day			1
he also moved back in with his mother , meaning he had extra money to spend on his obsession			0
he said : ' i did all my own washing and that meant that my mum never found out about my addiction to clean boxers			2
' luckily she never looked through my bin - it was full of boxers that i had only worn for one day at a time and then just thrown away			1
' the way i saw it was that people spend so much money on cigarettes and alcohol			0
for me , this was just how i chose to spend my money			0
' mr @entity5 eventually began feeling the squeeze when his mother increased his rent by £ 100			1
but , as his budget grew tighter , he simply reverted to budget boxers instead			0
' at @entity88 , when the shops changed their stock , i had no choice but to buy loads of boxers that had ' jingle balls ' printed on them , ' he said			0
but mr @entity5 was again forced to rethink his lifestyle when he received a hefty insurance bill through the post			1
he said : ' all of my savings had to go on paying my insurance			0
i tried to pick up odd jobs to fund my love for new boxers but it still was n't enough to keep afloat			0
i knew i had to stop			0
' after forking out for that big payment , i went upstairs and noticed that i only had three new pairs of boxers left			2
i panicked and started asking myself if my addiction to new boxers was weird			2
' for the first time in a year , i mustered up the courage to put a pair of boxers in the wash			1
' eventually , i started to rationalise it by telling myself that it was only me that had worn these boxers and i 'm a hygienic person so they must be fine			0
' it was only once mr @entity5 overcame his boxer addiction that he felt comfortable chatting about it with his friends			1
' i was watching a tv show about people with weird habits and i remember telling my friend about my addiction to fresh boxers , ' he said			2
' she said that i was absolutely crazy and could n't understand why on earth i spent so much money on underwear			0
