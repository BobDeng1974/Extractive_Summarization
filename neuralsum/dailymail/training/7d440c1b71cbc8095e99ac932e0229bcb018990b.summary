by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:14 est , 5 july 2013 updated : 19:45 est , 5 july 2013 looking unhappily dishevelled in the rain as he dutifully watched a border collie demonstrating its skill rounding up chickens , prince @entity3 ’s thoughts are bound to have strayed — if only for a moment — to the sanctuary of the white cottage where he and @entity11 have been staying all this week on their annual summer trip to @entity14			1
imagine his pleasure as the royal rump sank thankfully that evening into the deep cushioning of the stripy sofas			0
family ties : @entity20 , left and sister @entity11 are close confidants from there he could admire the @entity26 weavings on the walls while dinner was being set under the vaulted ceiling of the dining hall with its medieval - style wrought - iron chandeliers and stone fireplace that even features his own heraldic badge above it — the @entity14 ’s feathers			1
the 100 - year - old cottage is @entity3 ’s royal bolt - hole nestling close to the @entity39 in the @entity41 village of @entity42 , and is called @entity43			2
one who knew the 192 - acre estate with its three cottages before the @entity47 bought it in 2006 , remembers its ‘ tasteless ’ salmon pink walls and brown velour sofas			0
so different now , with its colour scheme of duck - egg blue — @entity11 ’s choice , it has been murmured			2
like the @entity57 of @entity59 ’s 21 holiday - let cottages in the @entity60 , @entity59 and @entity14 , this one ( which can not be rented , incidentally ) is the work of the only interior designer on whom the @entity57 ever calls , @entity11 ’s younger sister @entity20			1
until the former mrs @entity11 married the @entity14 at @entity65 in 2005 , the @entity57 ’s commissions to her little sister were ... zero			1
together at last : prince @entity3 and the @entity66 finally married in 2005 soon after @entity11 became @entity68 the @entity66 and the @entity57 decided to go into the holiday cottage - letting business , the first commissions were on their way to @entity20			1
one long - time family friend spikily described the work put her way as ‘ just a few crumbs from her big sister ’s table ’			0
but this week , amid renewed assorted cries of cronyism and nepotism , it emerged that the crumbs have grown into a loaf			0
indeed , in the past eight years , @entity20 has received almost £ 1.2 million from the 700 - year - old duchy for ‘ interior design services ’			1
in the past two years alone , ‘ fees and commission ’ have amounted to some £ 210,000 — not bad with the country going through lean times			2
her earnings from this source remain a substantial part of the recent income of @entity20 , which for some years has been run from a small industrial unit near @entity95 , @entity96 , rented from the council for £ 350 a month			1
@entity98 : @entity20 allowed @entity3 and @entity11 to have trysts at her @entity101 home because it is classed as a small business it is not required to submit full profit - loss accounts			1
but publicly available figures show that , just before the @entity57 work began , her company ’s liabilities exceeded assets by £ 54,000			2
figures for the last financial year show assets of £ 227,000			0
let us be clear about one thing : @entity20 is known to be good at her work			2
she says she always tries to mirror the taste of her clients			0
that duck - egg blue in @entity3 ’s @entity26 cottage is the basis of the theme because it happens to be @entity11 ’s favourite colour			1
but while @entity122 has many talented interior designers , @entity20 is the only one mentioned in the accounts of the @entity57 , which funds @entity3 ’s multi-million pound lifestyle and last year paid him some £ 19 million			1
so why do no other interior designers get a look in ? the @entity57 ’s answer comes directly from the @entity14 ’s spokesperson at @entity132 , and is crystal clear : ‘ the prince is very happy with mrs @entity20 ’s work — she ’s very experienced and does a good job			1
and as we have said many times before , the @entity57 does not have to put the work out to tender because it is a private estate			2
’ which is the sound of a door slamming shut on the hopes of others			0
could the reason be that he is indebted , in a way that he could never adequately repay , to his sister - in - law @entity20 for her help during his most difficult years while he was still married to @entity148			1
the two sisters have always been incredibly close , as was obvious as they sat together the other day in the royal box at @entity151			0
@entity152 is the easy intimacy of sisters who know each other ’s secrets			0
certainly , there is practically nothing that @entity20 — 18 months younger , and always seen as the prettier and brainier of the two — does not know about the tumultuous years of her sister ’s infamous affair with @entity3			1
she was hostess , chauffeur , confidante — ‘ the third person in the romance , ’ was the wry observation of a close family friend			0
allies : @entity20 and @entity11 together at this year 's @entity151 among their wider circle , however , it is generally accepted that , more than anyone else , @entity20 found herself ‘ sucked into the drama of her sister ’s affair ’ and , in many ways , found herself sharing the burden with her			1
one family friend feels she ‘ sometimes rather resented it as she had her own life to lead , but did it anyway as that ’s what sisters are for ’			0
both sisters married within a year of each other — @entity20 at 23 in 1972 to businessman @entity187 ( her only ‘ real ’ boyfriend ) , son of an @entity191 air chief marshal , @entity11 at 25 ( after a brief affair with prince @entity3 ) to dashing guards officer @entity193			1
in those later , endless years when @entity11 and @entity3 were secret lovers , it was @entity20 and @entity187 ’s country home , where they still live , in the @entity101 village of @entity202 that became the @entity14 and mrs @entity11 ’s favourite meeting place for discreet weekends			1
commissions : @entity20 is the only interior designer that the @entity57 of @entity59 uses and has been rewarded handsomely for her role thus @entity20 was drawn into @entity11 ’s drama			1
she became the sister that @entity11 simply could n’t do without			2
it was at @entity20 ’s own 40th birthday party , held in the @entity213 home of her friend @entity214 , that princess @entity148 angrily confronted @entity11 about her relationship with @entity3			1
again , @entity20 was at the wheel of the car in december 1992 that whisked @entity11 away and out of public view as prime minister @entity220 was announcing in the @entity221 the separation of the @entity14 and @entity148			1
most significantly of all , @entity3 used the occasion of @entity20 ’s 50th birthday party at the @entity225 in 1999 — just over a year after @entity148 ’s death — to publicly formalise the relationship with @entity11 that everyone knew about , by posing for pictures on the steps of the hotel			1
after this , @entity11 ’s enduring gratitude is only natural			2
‘ she will do anything she can for @entity238 , ’ says one of their circle			0
‘ and @entity3 will do anything to keep @entity11 happy			1
’ one way of keeping her happy was to ask @entity20 and @entity187 to join them on their honeymoon at @entity245			2
on their wedding night the staff set the honeymoon table for four			0
in fact , the @entity14 ’s gratitude to @entity20 is as considerable as @entity11 ’s			2
for all his many self - regarding faults , he never forgets people who do him a good turn			0
@entity256 bolt - hole : @entity11 , @entity66 , hosting a tea party at in @entity43 , with her favourite duck - egg blue colour in the background for her part , @entity20 , 64 , while publicly discreet , can be rather grand in private			2
‘ she ’s terribly prone to mention “ my sister @entity264 ” or “ my royal sister ” , ’ reports one significant member of their circle			0
‘ it ’s quite amusing			0
’ not so amusing is the unease among royal courtiers			0
for the @entity57 ’s exclusive patronage of @entity11 ’s sister is yet another awkward and potential damaging issue on top of those already building up over @entity3 ’s stewardship of the @entity57			1
he has approved feasibility studies to build large housing estates on some of the country ’s most cherished pastures despite intoning on television his familiar mantra about protecting the countryside			0
and renewed efforts are being made by @entity285 to change the way he pays tax on his @entity289 , all this has come about when the royals are going through their most popular and relaxed period for many years			0
‘ he could easily have ended the cronyism issue by asking other designers to submit ideas for the revamped cottages , ’ says one close figure			0
‘ but he wo n’t			0
yes , he ’s grateful to @entity20 , but he ’s stubborn as well			0

@entity3 and @entity11 had trysts at her sister @entity302 home
@entity20 is the only interior designer the @entity57 uses
in the past eight years , @entity20 has received almost £ 1.2m from the @entity57
