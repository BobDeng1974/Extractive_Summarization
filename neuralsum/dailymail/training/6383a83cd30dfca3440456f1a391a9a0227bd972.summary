anniversaries are coming thick and fast for @entity1			1
on christmas eve , he will celebrate a year ’s marriage to his wife , @entity3			2
it is uncommon for a footballer to celebrate nuptials in the middle of a season but the reason @entity1 chose that unique date is because of what happened last year : november 15 , 2013 was the day he became an @entity14 international			1
so much has happened to @entity1 since winning his first cap against @entity16 12 months ago – from his wedding to the @entity18 to a £ 23.7million move to @entity20 – it has been difficult , at times , to digest but there is no suggestion he wants merely to sit back and reflect on what has gone			1
@entity1 is pictured mimicking the front cover of the new @entity28 game @entity1 has had a busy year , from his wedding to the @entity18 to a big - money move to @entity20 @entity1 ( left ) celebrates with @entity30 after scoring a goal for @entity20 against @entity32 his thoughts are focused on self - improvement ; his ambitions are centred on making an impact for club and country and showing why he was prised away from @entity39 for one of the biggest transfer fees of the summer			1
there is much for @entity1 to prove for @entity20 and @entity14 – after games against @entity45 and @entity46 , the focus will turn to the @entity47 and then the @entity48 – but it is a challenge for which he is ready			1
‘ when you put it like that , yes , it has been a great year with everything that has gone on , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ a lot of things have happened and it will take some going to beat it next year			2
that is what i am going to try to do			2
hopefully we can win a trophy this season			1
‘ we all know results ( for @entity20 ) have n’t been to the level we want them to be – we have to just keep working hard			1
i ca n’t guarantee that results are going to change imminently , but i can assure you we are working hard for it to happen			2
the @entity20 midfielder admits there is no time for reflection as he looks to step up his impact this time last year , @entity1 made his international debut for @entity14 against @entity16 at @entity76 ‘ we have got a nice couple of games coming up internationally , and we all know we are facing a big couple of @entity48 games , plus we need to pick our form up in the league			1
i feel i am settling into the team nicely , albeit i want to up my contribution			2
’ that is now the big issue for @entity1			1
it is one thing thriving on the south coast , where the expectancy is less intense , but quite another to deliver in the goldfish bowl of @entity92 , where the pressure to deliver is unrelenting			0
@entity94 , who has just reclaimed his place in the @entity14 squad , once spoke of life at @entity20 as being a ‘ culture shock ’ and @entity1 recognises what the @entity99 midfielder meant			1
the spotlight in the city is always on			0
‘ it is a big difference coming from @entity39 , ’ he said			0
‘ i was expecting that			0
it is something i ’m learning to deal with and you just have to take it on board			0
the expectation is there , so you are expected to play better and more consistently			0
’ this week , @entity1 ( left ) is on international duty once more , pictured tussling with @entity115 's @entity114 @entity1 says he would like to win a trophy with @entity20 this season the same is true about @entity14			1
@entity1 , who grew up idolising @entity117 , could be classed as being a fixture in @entity120 ’s squad but , since that first run out against @entity16 , he has yet to establish himself as a regular starter			1
his 11 appearances added up to 575 minutes but last month was a breakthrough , as he completed the full game against @entity126 in @entity127 and is looking to build on that when @entity45 visit on saturday ; such fixtures might not capture the imagination of the public but @entity1 sees it differently			1
‘ it is about knowing what is in store at the end ( of the qualification programme ) , ’ says @entity1			2
‘ we do n’t play for @entity14 week in , week out so when we meet up we know what the job is and we do all the preparation we need to			0
@entity1 tries to take the ball past @entity142 during a wet and windy training session at @entity144 @entity1 's first season at @entity146 has already seen him face the might of @entity148 in the @entity48 ‘ we are favourites to go through our group but we know we ca n’t get complacent , we have to respect every team we play			1
the minute you take your foot off the gas , there are teams out there who cause upsets			0
’ he will leave nothing to chance			0
not on saturday and certainly not next tuesday , when hostilities are resumed across the border with @entity46			0
it will be a special night in @entity164 but @entity1 is not sure it should become an annual occurrence			2
‘ maybe it makes it special because it is n’t so regular , ’ he says			0
‘ it makes it more interesting			0
of course i understand it is a special fixture and everyone wants the bragging rights			0
it is a game we are looking forward to			0
the more competitive , the better			0
