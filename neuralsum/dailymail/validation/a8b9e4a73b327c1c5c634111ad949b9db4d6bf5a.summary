@entity0 has warned the @entity1 not to be fooled into believing they only have to shackle lethal striker @entity3 to get the better of @entity4			1
the @entity1 entertain the @entity6 leaders at the @entity7 on sunday evening looking for a victory which would take them level with the @entity11 and get their campaign back on track after november 's 1 - 0 defeat in @entity16			1
however , @entity17 has left his players in little doubt that preventing @entity3 from doing what he does best is only one of the missions in which they must succeed if they are to prosper , with @entity23 and @entity24 also representing significant threats			1
@entity0 ( left ) believes the @entity1 mus n't concentrate solely on @entity3 @entity0 said : ' i do n't think we need to say too much about @entity3 because we know exactly how much of a threat he is			1
but hopefully we can keep him quiet at the weekend			0
' but they are strong all over			0
they are plying their trades throughout the @entity34 leagues and they have got a top striker in @entity3 up front , so we all know how good they are			2
' @entity4 are a strong side			2
we have watched a lot of videos on them throughout the week already			0
the manager does n't want to leave any stone unturned going into it for set - pieces , et cetera			0
' we know how strong they are and we have done our homework , so hopefully we can deal with that on sunday			0
@entity3 has four goals to his name in as many games during the @entity54 qualfying campaign to date ' we ca n't dwell on how good they are , we have got to look at our own qualities and try to apply them in the game on sunday and get those three points that we really want			1
we have got our own pace down the flanks as well , so hopefully we can counteract that			0
' @entity3 has four goals to his name in as many games during the campaign to date , although they all came in @entity4 's 7 - 0 drubbing of minnows @entity67 in @entity68 in september , and it was @entity23 and @entity70 who were on target to defeat world champions @entity73 in @entity75 the following month			1
@entity1 compounded the @entity77 ' woes three days later when they emerged from their trip to @entity79 with a 1 - 1 draw , courtesy of @entity83 's injury - time equaliser , although their hopes of securing one of the two automatic qualification berths were dented by the reverse in @entity88			2
that left the @entity1 , the @entity16 and @entity91 's men locked together on seven points , three adrift of @entity4 , although @entity0 is confident there will be no hangover from the disappointment at @entity97			1
@entity0 and @entity98 ( right ) in action during a @entity1 training session on monday @entity83 ( left ) celebrates scoring an injury - time equaliser against @entity73 in october , 2014 he said : ' no , i do n't think so			1
obviously , we were disappointed with the result , but we ca n't dwell on that			0
' it was a close game , it was n't the prettiest , but if we keep looking back at that , then we are not going to be going forward , so we have just got to concentrate on this @entity4 game			2
' that 's gone now and we have got to look at our home form and try to get the three points here , which is most important			0
' @entity4 appear in 34th place in @entity116 's latest rankings list with @entity1 in 66th , and it has been to @entity118 's detriment that they have not been able to see off teams ranked above them in their most recent campaigns			1
roi manager @entity17 will lead his side out against @entity4 at the @entity7 on sunday that is a situation which will have to change if they are to finish in the top two , and the significance of that will not be lost on a bumper crowd at the @entity7 , the site of the former @entity131 stage on which @entity132 captured the imagination of a nation by dumping @entity135 out of the @entity136 back in 2001			1
@entity0 said : ' as a boy growing up on the streets of @entity140 , it 's where everybody wants to be			2
sometimes you pinch yourself , but being out on that pitch and playing for your country , you ca n't beat it			0
' the boys are all ready and waiting			0
we all know how big a game it is , the boys are all on it and really looking forward to it			0

@entity0 believes the @entity1 must n't focus solely on stopping @entity3
@entity0 *insists* his team - mates know @entity4 are strong ' all over the pitch '
@entity17 's side face @entity54 qualifier against @entity4 on sunday
