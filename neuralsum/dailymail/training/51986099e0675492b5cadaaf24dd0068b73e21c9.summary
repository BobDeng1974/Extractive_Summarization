by @entity0 published : 10:16 est , 4 june 2013 updated : 20:33 est , 4 june 2013 an internationally renowned artist who molested young girls he used as models walked free from court yesterday			1
child abuse campaigners said the suspended sentence on 70 - year - old @entity7 was ' outrageous ’ and sent out the message that such crimes are not taken seriously			1
but the judge said he had taken account of the artist ’s age and his ' irreversibly tarnished reputation ’			2
@entity7 , whose work has been exhibited at major galleries including the @entity17 in @entity18 , invited girls as young as six to sit for portraits and photographs			1
free man : shamed artist @entity7 , 70 , pictured arriving at @entity23 today , escaped with a 12 month suspended sentence he would blindfold his victims and make them wear @entity28 nightwear before removing the clothing and committing indecent acts , a jury heard			1
the artist was found guilty in april , but left court yesterday after he was sentenced insisting arrogantly that he had been the victim of a ' witch - hunt ’ and had ' been through considerable hell ’			1
asked if he thought everybody was wrong apart from him , he replied : ' since i ’m probably 20 times more intelligent than most people i think that would be a very reasonable assumption			0
’ his self - assessment does not match the description of him in court as ' a paedophile , a sexual abuser of children ’			0
suggesting that he would be appealing the guilty verdict , @entity7 added : ' i am not backing down and under no circumstances am i apologising for crimes that were never committed			2
’ the jury chose to believe the evidence that showed @entity7 was a predatory child abuser who assaulted young girls in incidents dating back between 25 and 40 years at his former home in @entity56 , @entity18 , as well as at his studio in @entity58			1
on his way to court yesterday the artist said judge @entity62 , who could have put him behind bars , was a ' poisonous man ’			2
' fallen from grace ' : @entity7 , 70 , was placed on the @entity66 's register for five years by the judge but as he left court @entity7 said : ' i am quite gobsmacked and i have to thank @entity70 for his judgment this time			1
with the language he used one anticipated getting banged up			0
’ he denied suggestions that his victims were traumatised by what he put them through as ' complete and utter b * * * * * * * ’			0
judge @entity62 had told @entity78 : ' you would take the children to your studio to photograph them			0
they had no understanding at that time what you were doing			0
shamed : at the peak of his popularity , @entity7 's paintings sold for £ 25,000 - a - time and were displayed at @entity92 s @entity91 and the @entity17 , and the @entity93 in @entity94 ' there can be no doubt that at that time you had a sexual interest in children			1
’ but the judge then justified his decision to suspend a 12 - month prison sentence for two years , saying the artist no longer posed a threat to children			0
adding that guidelines allowed for a jail term of up to five years , the judge told @entity23 : ' i take into account your age , the age of the offences , the considerable self - inflicted punishment that comes with your convictions , your steep fall from grace and your irreversibly tarnished reputation			2
’ @entity115 , chief executive of the @entity116 in @entity117 , said : ' it ’s an absolutely outrageous decision			0
' the judiciary is sending out the message that this crime is not taken seriously			0
’ @entity7 , who lives on @entity122 , @entity58 , was convicted of six charges of indecency with a child and one allegation of indecent assault , relating to three children			1
he was cleared of five further charges .			0

@entity7 , 70 , molested young girls he used as models
@entity134 said it was ' *unrealistic* ' to assume offences were isolated incidents
artist 's work once hung in the @entity17 and the @entity91
@entity142 abused between 1972 and 1985 in @entity18 and @entity122 , @entity58
@entity7 *refuses* to apologise and said he has committed no crime
he says he has been through ' considerable hell '
