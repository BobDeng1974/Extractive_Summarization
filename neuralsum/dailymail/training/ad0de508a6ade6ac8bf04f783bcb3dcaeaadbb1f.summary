a scan at a local hospital confirmed she was pregnant but the devastated girl said she was not ready to start a family at such a young age and wanted to have a termination			1
the girl was 21 weeks pregnant when the case went before the @entity31 as an emergency hearing in mid-march			1
the local authority , which is in the @entity34 , was forced to seek a declaration that the child had the capacity to make the abortion decision herself			1
this was required to ensure that doctors and hospital trusts could not be sued if they carried out the medical procedure			0
if the girl was not capable of fully understanding the situation , the local authority would be allowed to terminate the pregnancy if doctors believed it was in her best interests			1
