@entity0 is launching a crackdown on drunk tourists and is considering introducing breathalyser tests for pedestrians in a bid to make their streets safer			1
the proposals , suggested by the country 's @entity9 , are intended to stop visitors to the country from staggering into the path of oncoming cars after they 've been drinking			1
anybody stopped by police officers on @entity0 streets could be asked to take a breathalyser or drugs test if they are believed to be implicated in a road traffic accident			2
tourists walking down the famous @entity24 street in @entity25			0
under new proposals police in @entity0 could breathalyse pedestrians in a bid to crackdown on drunk tourists the proposals would also re-class pedestrians as road users , who have the same responsibility to keep safe as drivers			1
but according to the @entity37 , the plan has been criticised by several members of the @entity0 government because there has n't been a limit imposed on what constitutes as too much alcohol			0
concerns have also been raised that it would breach privacy and freedom of people in the country			1
but the traffic directorate insist that police can already carry out alcohol and drugs tests on pedestrians , who are thought to have broken the law			2
@entity56 , the organisation 's director , said : ' municipal police have been carrying out these tests for months â€“ there is nothing new here that will allow us to start sanctioning pedestrians , whether economically or with penalty points			2
' the @entity66 insist that police can already carry out alcohol and drugs tests on pedestrians who are thought to have broken the law ( file picture ) other plans by the organisation have also included imposing speed limits on joggers and the possibility of fining people who leave the house without glasses , or wearing dark clothing at night			1
in a 2011 study published in the @entity82 , it found that 55 per cent of walkers under the influence of alcohol ignored pedestrian crossings , compared to just 22 per cent of sober ones			0
in conclusion the research also urged traffic safety and injury prevention programmes to address irresponsible alcohol use in pedestrians			0
meanwhile a study last year in the @entity95 found that one pedestrian in seven injured on the roads in @entity95 is drunk at the time			0
figures from the @entity99 reveal more than 6,000 intoxicated pedestrians have been injured since 2011 .			0

proposals by @entity0 's @entity66 are a bid to make the streets safer
could see pedestrians being breathalysed if they are considered too drunk
hoped it will stop tourists who have been drinking from *stumbling* into cars
concerns have been raised the plans breach people 's freedom and privacy
but @entity66 say police are already sanctioned to carry out tests
