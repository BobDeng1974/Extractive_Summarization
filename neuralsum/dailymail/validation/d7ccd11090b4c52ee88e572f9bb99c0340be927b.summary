the last salmon fisherman on the @entity1 is embroiled in a legal battle with the @entity3 - after catching just a single fish too many			1
@entity5 , 71 , has been catching salmon in traditional basket traps since the 1970s and once netted up to 600 fish a year worth £ 100 each			1
but his livelihood was thrown into doubt in 2012 when the @entity3 ruled that no individual fisherman could land more than 30 in a season			1
@entity5 is the last remaining commercial salmon fisherman on the @entity1 and claims it is impossible for him to make a living if he is restricted to catching just 30 fish in a season the @entity1			1
@entity5 's home in @entity19 , @entity20 , is around six miles from the town of @entity22 , off which he fishes			2
the 71 - year - old used to catch up to 600 salmon a year worth £ 100 each defiant @entity5 continued to use his putcher rank - an array of 650 basket - like traps - and hit the quota in just 26 days			1
as a protest he presented his 31st fish to the local @entity3 office - and was duly prosecuted			1
he won his case but the agency has now announced plans to appeal the decision			0
@entity5 said : ' when i caught the 30th fish , i rang them up and told them i was going to fish in excess of the 30 - i even brought them my 31st fish			2
' they seized my fish and warned me of a prosecution - which is exactly what i wanted because i was very anxious to get my evidence before a court			0
' the @entity3 introduced the new quotas amid fears that the salmon population in the @entity1 was dangerously low			0
@entity5 , of @entity19 , @entity20 , has won his case , but must face another hearing in the @entity52 after catching his 31st fish @entity5 was prosecuted for breaching his licence and the case was heard at the @entity56 in @entity57 in february			1
@entity5 , of @entity19 , @entity20 , argued that the unreasonably low quota threatened his livelihood and would put him out of business			2
he claims his form of fishing has minimal impact on salmon in the @entity1 , as his putchers stretch out just a couple of hundred metres from the riverbank			2
that leaves a mile of open water for the fish to swim past his cages , he argued , allowing plenty of space			0
despite winning the case his legal battle still shows no signs of ending as the @entity3 has vowed to take it to the @entity52			0
a spokesman said : ' although the judge has at this stage ruled in mr @entity5 's favour , we will be seeking leave to appeal to the @entity52			0
' all of these sites are designated to protect salmon , and these populations are currently under threat			0
' we impose restrictions on salmon fishing for all fisheries in these areas because of the need to protect the designated habitats and fisheries			0

@entity5 has been fishing with traditional basket traps since the 1970s
