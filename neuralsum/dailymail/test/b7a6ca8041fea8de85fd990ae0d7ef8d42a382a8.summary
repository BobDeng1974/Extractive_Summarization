former pub landlord @entity0 has had his conviction for illegally showing foreign footage of @entity4 games overturned after eight years a pub landlord convicted of showing @entity4 football matches on foreign tv channels has won an eight - year legal battle to clear his name			1
@entity0 says he has paid a heavy price for the lengthy fight to get his conviction quashed and has lost his pub as a result			2
mr @entity0 , 55 , was convicted of showing a @entity4 game without having an agreement with official broadcasters in november 2006 at the @entity17 in @entity18 , @entity19			1
he said he could not afford to pay @entity21 's rates for football matches , and opted instead to show @entity24 transmissions of matches , which he says he thought was legal			2
but he was convicted , fined and ordered to pay costs eight years ago , when screening the matches was still treated as a criminal offence			2
judge @entity29 has now upheld his appeal and overturned the conviction following a landmark @entity33 court ruling			1
his appeal took so long as he had to launch the case after the @entity35 found enforcing previous rules was anti-competitive			2
mr @entity0 said he was ' overwhelmed ' that a judge and magistrates had upheld his appeal after all this time			0
but it is a bitter - sweet victory , as the long - running dispute cost him his business and his livelihood			0
he said : ' we put a lot of money into that pub and it went from a thriving business to absolutely zero			0
people stopped coming to the pub , it cost me my business			0
' mr @entity0 launched an appeal against his conviction soon after his trial , but the case was delayed by a similar test case which went as far as the @entity35			2
the court ruled that having an exclusive system was a restraint of free trade and contrary to @entity63			0
but the landlord says the court action has seen him lose the @entity17 in @entity18 which he used to run mr @entity0 's appeal was further delayed until another case involving @entity68 , the company which took him to court on behalf of the @entity4 , but which no longer does so			1
mr @entity0 was awarded his legal costs , which he paid privately , but he would not disclose the sum			0
the @entity33 court decision in 2012 cleared a landlady of a criminal conviction , but judges left the door open for court action against publicans by ruling pubs should get permission from the copyright owner before screening matches			2
the @entity4 has since been taking landlords to civil courts for breaching copyright , with some ordered to pay up to £ 65,000 in costs			1
the league sends teams of investigators to pubs around the country to try and catch those screening games illegally			0
legal cases have been brought against 250 bars and pubs during the current football season			0
he said he does not know whether he can retrieve the £ 1,000 fine and £ 1,500 costs ordered by the magistrates			0
despite the decision , the @entity4 has insisted pubs still can not show foreign - tv footage of its games			1
since the @entity35 decision , it is taking landlords to civil courts and suing them using copyright laws , which were not affected by the previous ruling			1
in 2012 , pub @entity110 won a landmark legal battle to overturn her conviction for using foreign decoders instead of @entity21 to show @entity4 football matches			1
ms @entity116 , who ran @entity118 pub in @entity119 , @entity120 , bought games through a @entity123 satellite broadcaster @entity124 for £ 800 a year instead of @entity21 , which was then priced at £ 700 - a - month			0
the @entity4 took legal action against her mrs @entity116 and she was fined £ 8,000 for dishonest reception of a television reception in 2006			1
but a @entity35 ruling said having an exclusive system of tv rights was contrary to @entity133 law and the @entity134 overturned her conviction			1
a recent investigation by trade publication , @entity138 , quoted a pub landlord saying @entity140 cost him £ 16,000 - a - year , compared to the £ 300 - per - year of screening it illegally			0
the decision came after @entity119 landlady @entity116 won a @entity33 court battle over her conviction			0
despite the ruling , the @entity4 can still take pub owners to civil courts over breach of copyright			1

landlord was convicted and fined for showing @entity24 footage of games
but landmark @entity35 ruling has since ended such *prosecutions*
landlord has now had convicted overturned but has since lost his pub
@entity4 still taking landlords to civil court using copyrights laws
