we are aware that the wake up phase can take a long time			0
' the family continues to strongly believe in @entity3 's recovery and place all their trust in the doctors , nurses and nursing auxiliaries team			1
' the important thing is not the speed of the recovery but that @entity3 ’s healing process progresses in a continuous and controlled way			1
" @entity3 's accident occurred on december 29 in the @entity7 ski resort of @entity75 , where he owns a chalet			1
he had been skiing on the piste with his son and family friends but shortly after 11am moved to a patch of rocky off - piste located between two runs			2
he skied into a rock and then catapulted on to another banging his head with such force that his helmet split in two			0

devoted : @entity3 has been at @entity90 in @entity30 since december			2
above , @entity3 is pictured with his wife @entity91 in @entity92 @entity3 , the seven - times formula 1 champion , is being kept under constant scrutiny to detect any movement at all investigators said it was a freak accident and @entity3 , who is a very competent skier , was not skiing at an excessive speed			2
he was airlifted off the mountain and taken to @entity30 where doctors put him into a medically - induced coma			2
a scan revealed he had suffered serious brain damage			0
his manager released a statement later that night saying the sportsman was fighting for his life			2
surgeons performed two operations to relieve pressure on his brain and remove blood clots in the days following his accident			0
@entity91 , 44 , with whom the champion has two children @entity117 , 16 , and @entity118 , 14 , has remained at his bedside			0
his manager this week refused to comment on @entity2 media reports that he had contracted a lung infection			1
pneumonia is among the greatest life - threatening conditions that can afflict people in @entity3 's position			2
the lack of a competent swallowing mechanism can make saliva run into the lungs and trigger the potentially lethal respiratory infection			0

' he receives food through a tube to his stomach , oxygen via a hose from a machine next to his bed as he still can not breathe independently			0
three times daily his joints and muscles are massaged to prevent atrophy and bed sores			0
the coma suppressed his swallowing reflex , pain perception and his respiratory drive			2
he has to be acutely monitored around the clock during this wake - up phase to see if such things are returning naturally - if at all			0
his blood is also thinned to prevent thrombosis and he is regularly turned and even stood straight up at times to keep blood flowing			0
he lies on a special air - filled mattress to prevent pressure sores and his urinary tract is under constant vigilance because of the danger of waste bacteria entering the bloodstream and causing another potentially fatal infection .			0

meanwhile family issue statement saying they are positive about his health
