by @entity0 for @entity1 a senior federal nuclear expert has urged regulators to shut down the last operating nuclear plant in @entity5 until it is established it will be safe if the @entity6 suffers another earthquake			1
@entity8 , who was the on - site inspector of @entity10 plant for five years , says in a confidential document that the @entity12 ( @entity12 ) is not applying the safety rules it set out for the plant 's operation			1
the 42 - page file says that no one knows whether the facility 's key equipment can withstand stronger shaking - and only yesterday the state was hit by another quake , striking with a magnitude of 6.0			1
@entity10 's reactors , which are nearly 30 years old , produce enough electricity for more than three million people annually			1
the former site inspector filed the document as an appeals notice to the @entity12 in july 2013			0
usually the appeals process takes no longer than 120 days but there is yet to be a ruling			0
the @entity12 and plant owner @entity41 ( @entity41 ) insist the facility is safe and that it complies with its operating license , including earthquake safety standards			2
@entity8 was the on - site inspector of @entity10 for five years as part of his role with the @entity48 the disaster preparedness of the world 's nuclear plants was thrown into the spotlight in 2011 following the meltdowns at @entity54 in @entity55 , which caused irreversible damage to the environment and forced 300,000 people to evacuate the area			1
a magnitude 9.0 earthquake and tsunami destroyed the plant 's power and cooling systems , leading the @entity12 to reevaluate plant safety in the @entity67			1
yesterday a magnitude 6.0 quake struck northern @entity5 , injuring dozens and cutting out power to thousands of people , but causing no problems for @entity10			1
the conflict between mr @entity8 and the @entity12 stems from the 2008 discovery of the @entity76 fault , which snakes offshore about half a mile from the reactors			2
according to mr @entity8 ’s filing , @entity41 research in 2011 determined that any of three nearby faults – the @entity76 , @entity81 and @entity82 – are capable of producing significantly more ground motion during an earthquake than was accounted for in the design of important plant equipment			0
in the case of @entity82 , it is as much as 75 per cent more , mr @entity8 claims			0
the analysis says @entity41 failed to demonstrate that the equipment would continue to work if exposed to the stronger shaking , violating its operating license			0
it adds that the agency should shut the facility down until it is proven that piping , reactor cooling and other systems can deal with the stronger shaking			0
the @entity12 says @entity10 ’s reactors can withstand the largest projected earthquake from the faults , and says the largest threat is from the @entity105 fault , a crack discovered in the 1970s about three miles from the plant 's site , by which time construction already underway			1
mr @entity8 said in the document that continuing with the reactors ' challenges the presumption of nuclear safety ' mr @entity8 , who is now a senior instructor at the @entity12 ’s training center in @entity116 , declined to comment on the filing			1
the @entity12 also said it would not comment on the document			0
@entity41 spokesman @entity118 said the @entity12 had looked into the threat of earthquakes on the reactor and had found @entity10 to be ' seismically safe '			2
mr @entity118 said that the core issue involving earthquake shaking was resolved in the late 1970s with seismic retrofitting of the plant			0
if the plant did close to strengthen its defense against earthquakes , it would not be the first in @entity5 to do so			2
the @entity132 plant , which was within 3,000 yards of three faults , was shut down in 1976 to reinforce its ability to withstand possible earthquakes			0
restarting it became more difficult and costly than projected and the plant never reopened .			0

*ex-inspector* of @entity10 says plant should be shut down *temporarily*
the last nuclear plant in the state lies next to *numerous* fault lines
continuing with reactors ' challenges the presumption of nuclear safety '
nearly 30 - year - old reactors provide power for more than three million people
yesterday @entity5 was struck by a 6.0 magnitude quake
