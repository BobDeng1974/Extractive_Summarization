@entity1 ’s @entity0 have seldom made life easy for themselves this season - and thursday night was another case in point			1
they enjoyed plenty of first - half chances and dominated possession throughout against @entity10 in the @entity11 but could n’t put their @entity13 hosts away			1
even a quarter - hour stoppage following a power cut , which plunged the stadium into darkness , could n’t stem the flow of regular @entity0 attacks and @entity20 , as so often , was the chief culprit , missing two very presentable chances			1
@entity23 also had a goal chalked off for offside			0
@entity26 scored the only goal of the game to ensure @entity10 topped their @entity30 group @entity0 goalkeeper @entity31 was unable to stop @entity26 's strike from nestling into the back of his net @entity20 should have given @entity0 the lead in the first half but fluffed his chance then , the inevitable sucker punch			1
@entity31 had n’t been tested too often but could do little as @entity26 scored from close range to ensure @entity10 leapfrogged @entity0 to finish top of @entity41 as @entity1 said afterwards : ‘ i ’m disappointed because we dominated , but in football you need to score when you create chances and dominate			1
we had clear chances but we were unlucky in front of goal			2
‘ one minute in the second - half changed the game and it ’s true , we dominated , but we needed to score			1
it ’s disappointing because we deserved more			0
’ it ’s hard to argue with @entity1 ’s assessment but as thoughts drift towards monday ’s last 32 draw , he ’ll be privately annoyed his team failed to get the job done			1
the game against @entity10 had to be suspended for 13 minutes after the lights went out in the stadium @entity0 playmaker @entity23 evades @entity62 during the encounter at @entity11 follow all the latest # @entity30 action on : @entity65 : @entity66 @entity67 : @ @entity68 and at @entity69 the moral of so many @entity72 campaigns is that it ’s a good idea to finish top of your group			1
the equation really is simple			0
finish top and you ’re one of the seeded clubs - one of the predators rather than the prey			2
you only have to look at @entity83 in the @entity84 to see the benefits of leading the way			0
last season , they finished second to @entity89 in their group and were subsequently eliminated by @entity91			0
the year before , they trailed @entity93 and the same fate befall them			0
@entity91 went on to win the competition			0
in 2010 - 11 , they were bested in the group by @entity97 - and promptly ousted by @entity98			0
a little extra perspiration in the group stage can often lead to greater glories further along the line			0
@entity0 and @entity10 players talk to the referee after the floodlights failed again in @entity106 fans at the @entity11 had to use their phones after the lights went out to suspend play for @entity0 , it means they could be paired on monday with the likes of @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 or @entity117 , rather than @entity118 , @entity119 or @entity120			1
that first quintet is , of course , a worst case scenario but @entity0 wo n’t get a great deal of change out of any of the seeds			2
there ’s a sense of inevitability that @entity0 will be drawn alongside @entity117 in @entity130 on monday and come face - to - face with their former manager @entity132			1
this is not the tortured soul seen at @entity0 or @entity135 either			2
@entity132 ’s @entity117 may not have advanced in the @entity84 but they currently enjoy a seven - point lead in the @entity138 table			0
@entity0 boss @entity1 will have been disappointed with his side 's performance in @entity106 @entity1 brought on @entity141 to try and inject some life into @entity0 's side and a late winter trek to @entity145 is never an attractive proposition , for fans , players or managers			1
other possible long - haul trips include @entity151 and @entity152 , though you would fancy @entity0 to overcome them			1
@entity113 have been familiar foes for @entity0 in recent years and while being drawn against the @entity156 giants may conjure up happy memories of @entity160 ’s @entity159 hat - trick and that two - legged @entity30 win , it ’s not one they ’ll relish			2
nor @entity114 , who put out @entity167 last season , @entity163 , @entity116 or @entity164 , who have dropped down from @entity135 ’s @entity84 group			0
@entity169 gave @entity170 an almighty fright last year , while @entity172 is about as hostile as it gets in @entity72			0
@entity10 ' players celebrate after their 1 - 0 win against @entity0 ensures they finish top of @entity41 go through @entity0 ’s potential opponents one - by - one and you soon realise that danger lurks everywhere			1
the @entity30 has certainly gained in strength			0
in many ways , the unseeded portion of the draw is n’t a lot better			0
but while @entity0 could have landed @entity185 , @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 or @entity189 , they could just as easily pulled out a side with very little @entity72 experience like @entity119 or @entity118			2
their fate now rests in the hands of the drawmaster on monday but @entity1 may live to regret his team not holding out for that draw to top the table in @entity106 .			2

@entity0 were beaten 1 - 0 by @entity10 in @entity198 on thursday evening
spurs finished *runners* - up to @entity13 leaving them unseeded for next round
@entity1 's side dominated the game but failed to take chances
