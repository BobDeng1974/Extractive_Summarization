by @entity0 raising beef for the @entity4 dinner table does far more damage to the environment than producing pork , poultry , eggs or dairy , a new study says			1
compared with the other animal proteins , beef produces five times more heat - trapping gases per calorie , puts out six times as much water - polluting nitrogen , takes 11 times more water for irrigation and uses 28 times the land , according to the study published monday in the journal @entity20			1
cows are not efficient at converting feed to protein for human consumption , said lead author @entity26 , an environmental physics professor at @entity27 in @entity28			1
compared to the other animal proteins , beef produces five times more heat - trapping gases connected to global warming per calorie @entity26 used @entity4 government figures to calculate air and water emissions and how much water and land were used in the lifetime production of beef , pork , poultry , dairy and eggs			1
while other studies have looked at the issue , this is one of the most comprehensive pieces of research quantifying and comparing the @entity4 environmental costs of different meats and other animal protein			1
the beef industry called the study ' a gross oversimplification of the complex systems that make up the beef value chain			2
' @entity62 , sustainability director at the @entity63 , said that the industry has improved its environmental sustainability in recent years and that the @entity4 produces beef with the lowest greenhouse gas emissions of any country			1
in the study , pork , poultry , dairy and eggs all had comparable environmental footprints , so close there were no statistically significant differences among them , @entity26 said			1
but cows were off - the - chart different			0
the study did not look at plants or fish raised for human consumption			1
cows burp major amounts of methane , a greenhouse gas that is dozens of times more potent than carbon dioxide			0
their digestive system makes them produce considerably more methane than pigs , chickens or turkeys do , @entity26 said			0
the manure used to grow feed for cows also releases methane , as does their own bodily waste			0
because they are bigger and take longer to put on weight for meat , cows eat more food over their lifetimes than other animals raised for protein			0
polluters : cows are not efficient at converting feed to protein for human consumption , said lead author @entity26 , an environmental physics professor at @entity27 in @entity28 nitrogen , from fertilizer runoff , can harm rivers , lakes and bays , causing oxygen - depleted ' dead zones			1
' the use of irrigation water is a major issue out @entity118 when there are droughts , like the current one in @entity121			2
so much land used for farming changes the biodiversity of a location , @entity26 said			0
' it really looks like beef is a lot worse environmentally than these other meats , ' said @entity130 , an environmental scientist at the @entity131			0
@entity130 was n't part of this study , but has a separate study of beef 's greenhouse gas footprint around the world , published this month in the journal @entity139			1
@entity26 calculates that the average @entity4 who switches from beef to pork would reduce the equivalent of 1,200 pounds of carbon dioxide a year , which is about nine days ' worth of the nation 's per capita greenhouse gas emissions			1
the @entity146 calculates that it is the same as the emissions from 61 gallons of gas or what comes out of the smokestack from burning 580 pounds of coal			0
@entity130 said his calculations found that " eating a pound of beef causes more greenhouse warming than burning a gallon of gasoline			0
" even though pigs have the reputation for being dirty , the data shows that they ' come out pretty clean ' when compared to cows , @entity26 said			0
the message from the study is ' whenever possible try to replace beef with other sources of protein from animal sources , ' said @entity26 , who said he does n't eat meat now but used to raise cattle on a kibbutz in @entity171			2
nutrition scientists @entity172 at @entity174 and @entity175 at @entity176 said the study makes sense , was done carefully and is important			0
@entity130 , whose study examined livestock and greenhouse gas internationally , found that livestock accounted for 9 percent of the world 's total greenhouse gases , and their overall output has increased 51 percent since 1961			2
he also found that the developed world - including the @entity4 - decreased its carbon emissions from livestock by 23 percent , while the developing world has more than doubled its emissions in that category			2
so overall greenhouse gases from livestock rose by more than 50 percent			0
countries like the @entity4 are importing beef from developing countries , potentially skewing the results , @entity26 said .			2

raising beef for the @entity4 dinner table does far more damage to the environment than producing pork , poultry , eggs or dairy
the *findings* come from a study published monday in the journal @entity20
compared with the other animal proteins , beef produces five times more heat - trapping gases per calorie and puts out six times as much water - polluting nitrogen
beef also takes 11 times more water for irrigation and uses 28 times the land
the study did not look at plants or fish raised for human consumption
