' so that 's the thing that 's curious			0
' ms @entity9 said she did n't tell anyone , including the police , about the alleged sexual assault for years because she believed that @entity2 was too famous and too powerful for anyone to take her seriously			1
she said she could n't even tell her mother about what allegedly happened			2
last month , she told @entity40 in excruciating detail how @entity2 allegedly drugged her after he went to his @entity43 home and had a single glass of wine as an impressionable 17 - year - old in 1985			1
she passed out and came to wearing only a man 's t - shirt and her underwear , certain that she had been sexually assaulted			0
she claimed he also pinned her down and tried to rape her in his hotel suite in @entity53 in 1987			0
she also said she has never asked for , nor taken money from @entity2			2

the cat is out of the bag , people have it in their head			0
i have a lot of questions for the lady , maybe she 'll come on			0
' in november 2006 , @entity2 settled a civil lawsuit with @entity80 , a former @entity81 employee who claimed he had drugged and sexually assaulted her in his @entity84 - area mansion two years earlier			1
her lawyers said they had the names of 13 other women who had come forward voluntarily with similar accounts of drugging or abuse at the hands of @entity2 - but the settlement was reached before the other women could testify			1
last month , @entity9 revealed to @entity40 that she had been drugged and raped by @entity2 in 1985 , when she was a 17 - year - old aspiring actress			1
she was one of the 13 women willing to support @entity96 in 2006			0
@entity97 has become the latest woman to accuse him of raping her			0
on sunday , she revealed she was working as a writer for @entity2 in 1969 , when he drugged and sexually abused her on two occasions , she said			2

' i hope that there is justice for this lady			0
i hope somebody gets to the bottom of this , but i ’m going to reserve my judgment because i have a lot of questions , as i said			0
it ’s crazy , but i have a lot of questions , because i know we all have friends who have gone through this			0
' co-host @entity121 responded to @entity0 : ' it ’s more than awkward , it ’s a tragedy ! ' ' either 13 women were raped by someone too powerful to face the criminal justice system or an innocent man is being falsely accused			2
' thirteen women signed on to a 2005 lawsuit brought by @entity80 alleging sexual assault			1
ms @entity9 said she testified as part of that lawsuit but never received a payout after @entity2 settled out of court			1
@entity2 's lawyer has denied the new round of claims and has said that the 77 - year - old would n't ' dignify ' the claims with a response			1
when asked by @entity61 over the weekend , @entity2 smiled and refused to respond			2
@entity2 has never been charged with any crime relating to the allegations now swirling around him			2
@entity0 said she is not convinced by the claims against @entity2			1
and the fact that he settled a 2005 lawsuit brought by another sex assault accuser , should not be seen as an admission of guilt			1
' you have to really take a minute and follow the evidence - follow what happened , ' she said			0
' we 'll know when we know			0
that 's what i know			0

@entity0 wondered on ' @entity6 ' why @entity2 accuser @entity9 never went to the police
ms @entity9 told @entity40 that she did n't even tell her own mother about the assault for years
she came forward in 2005 following a lawsuit brought by another rape accuser
