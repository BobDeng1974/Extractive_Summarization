@entity1 ’ much - heralded return to action ended in abject failure yesterday as he shot his worst round as a professional to miss the cut by a country mile at the @entity8			1
while @entity1 ’ attendance at the event came with a fanfare and a record crowd , his 11 - over - par round of 82 matched the miserable wet weather at @entity15			1
it was just the 13th time in his career that @entity1 had missed the cut in a professional event and it left him last on the early second - round leaderboard — exactly where he finished at his own @entity22 event in december on his comeback from injury			1
woods searches for his stray ball in a cactus at the @entity8 as his dismal start to 2015 continues @entity1 looks on pensively during the second round of the @entity8 the 14 - time major winner struggled in @entity31 on the back - nine , shooting his equal worst nine - hole 44 woods , who struggled last year after having back surgery in march and took four months off from august to fully recover , expected to be a little rusty			1
but he had not planned on propping up the 132 - man field , especially after comments before the tournament about feeling as good as ever under the direction of new swing consultant @entity38			2
the 39 - year - old hit a triple bogey , two double bogeys , six bogeys and just two birdies to close on 13 - over - par. it was so bad that all he could do was try to laugh it off			2
‘ i ’m just doing this so i do n’t get fined , ’ @entity1 joked in reference to @entity48 running back @entity49 ’s infamous line at a @entity52 media day this week			1
‘ we all have days like this			0
unfortunately mine was in a public setting			0
but even on bad days like this you just have to keep fighting			0
’ @entity1 plays a difficult shot on his knee ( left ) and reacts after playing a stray shot ( right ) in @entity31 @entity1 put most of the blame on adapting to changes in his swing			1
he said : ‘ i was caught between patterns , old pattern , new pattern			0
' i got it better on my back nine and hit some better shots , but i ’ve still got a lot of work to do on it			0
’ so much so that @entity1 suggested he may skip tomorrow ’s @entity52 in @entity31 and instead practice at home in @entity74			1
here is the scorecard ( he started on the back - nine ) from @entity1 ' second round in @entity31 : the 39 - year - old takes time to consider his shot having shot a nightmare 44 back - nine at the @entity8 @entity1 fails to hide his frustration during the worst round of his professional career , shooting an 82 the @entity84 had a disastrous start to his second round , shooting an equal worst 44 on the back - nine he said : ‘ i ’m going home right now			1
i ’ve got to practice each and every day			0
hitting golf balls is one thing and playing golf at home is another			2
playing tournament golf is entirely another			2
i have to continue with the process			0
‘ i have been here before			0
it was n’t that long ago that i changed my swing with @entity99 and i was @entity100 only a year ago			0
you ’ve got to keep things in perspective , and sometimes it ’s difficult to do that			0
’ @entity1 keeps his eye on a shot during the second round of the rain hit @entity8 a weary @entity1 walks off the green with @entity111 after his dismal second round in @entity31 despite his record worst round of his professional career , @entity1 still manged to break into a smile			1
