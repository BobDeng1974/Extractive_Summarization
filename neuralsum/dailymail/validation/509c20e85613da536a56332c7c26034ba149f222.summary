@entity0 and @entity1 are at war over @entity4 plans to order savage new cuts in @entity7 ’s @entity6			1
the dispute , one of the first to erupt between the @entity11 neighbours , has been sparked by fears the @entity4 plans to slash another £ 1billion from the @entity13 ’s ( @entity13 ) budget			1
the chancellor is refusing to guarantee to protect the @entity6 from cuts after the election , saying it would undermine his attempts to reduce the @entity7 ’s debt			1
the dispute has been sparked by fears the @entity4 plans to slash £ 1billion from the @entity13 ’s budget - and chancellor @entity1 ( pictured left ) is refusing to guarantee to protect the @entity6 but the prime minister fears it will damage relations with @entity26 president @entity25 , who urged him last month not to set a bad example to other @entity30 nations by cutting spending			1
the row was revealed on the eve of a @entity35 revolt over defence in the commons this week			1
up to 30 conservative mps are thought to be backing a bid by @entity40 , mp for @entity41 and @entity42 , to force a protest vote against defence cuts			1
it follows controversy over whether @entity7 will stick to the @entity30 target of spending two per cent of its gross domestic product on defence			2
@entity35 @entity38 claim that if mr @entity1 gets his way the figure will fall below that level			1
and @entity54 has learned that the prime minister shares the rebels ’ worries			1
the prime minister fears cuts will damage relations with @entity26 president @entity25 ( both pictured ) ‘ the stumbling block is mr @entity1 not mr @entity0 , ’ said a senior conservative			1
‘ @entity1 has made it clear the @entity13 can not be exempt from cuts			1
the pm fears it will expose him at @entity30 meetings , where he has been urging others to stick to two per cent			2
‘ he will be called a phoney if he is n’t spending it himself			0
’ one @entity35 mp said : ‘ mr @entity0 has a natural affinity with the @entity6			1
as pm he is constantly talking to generals and visiting troops all over the world			0
he knows the importance of maintaining our front line strength with @entity76 and @entity77 causing havoc			0
‘ but you rarely see mr @entity1 anywhere near a tank or battlefield			1
he is interested in money , not military matters			0
’ mr @entity0 secretly visited the @entity86 headquarters at @entity87 last week and is said to have returned more determined than ever to win his trial of strength with the chancellor			1
in a powerful personal plea to mr @entity0 during talks in @entity93 last month , @entity25 gave him a blunt warning : maintain @entity7 defence spending or weaken @entity30			1
he said : ‘ if @entity7 does n’t spend two per cent on defence , then no one in @entity97 will			2
’ but military top brass fear the @entity4 will raid another £ 1billion a year from @entity13 coffers to try to balance the nation ’s books			1
defence spending in the @entity7 is forecast to drop to 1.7 per cent by 2020 , even without further cuts			2
but mr @entity1 was defended by one influential @entity35 who said : ‘ we have ring - fenced overseas aid , the @entity105 and schools			1
if we do the same with the @entity13 it will mean even bigger cuts elsewhere , such as the @entity108 and policing			1
the chancellor has to be fair if we are to get out of the red			2
’ spokesmen for mr @entity0 and mr @entity1 said there was no rift			1
no wonder putin feels free to buzz britain with his bombers by @entity40 , ex-soldier , mp and member of @entity118			0
at this time of mounting global uncertainty , @entity7 needs a strong defence to deter potential aggressors			2
last week we learned that @entity123 , the top general in the @entity124 , is ‘ very concerned ’ by the falling levels of our defence spending – and even suggested that @entity7 brigades might have to operate within @entity26 divisions on future operations			1
@entity40 believes @entity7 needs a strong defence to deter potential aggressors this should certainly make us pause for thought			2
as a bare minimum , @entity7 must abide by its @entity30 commitment to spend two per cent of gdp on defence			0
we are hovering around this figure and forecasts suggest we will shortly fall below the threshold			0
this would be a grave mistake			0
maintaining a capable military can do much to prevent conflict , as @entity30 proved throughout the @entity144			0
@entity7 needs to remain a global power to protect our strategic interests and support our alliances			0
we require @entity6 of sufficient capability and capacity to respond to any challenge – including the ability to act in an independent , sovereign manner			2
in addition , a successful foreign policy is underpinned by the heft of a strong and well - resourced military			0
a shrinking defence budget threatens our ability to lead global opinion , reduces our foreign policy options and sends the wrong message to both allies and potential adversaries alike			2
yet the @entity164 continues to make cuts , as starkly demonstrated by the decision to replace 20,000 @entity124 regulars with 30,000 reservists			0
the @entity169 has been reduced to 19 surface ships			0
the last strategic defence review suggested a minimum of 30			0
the scrapping of the @entity175 ’s venerable @entity174 means we are without a maritime patrol aircraft			0
no wonder the @entity177 feel they have free rein to fly their bombers and position their submarines around our coasts			0
@entity183 is becoming increasingly impatient			0
on thursday , mps from all sides of the @entity186 will support my debate demanding that the government should meet @entity7 ’s @entity30 commitment			0
the first duty of @entity189 is the defence of the realm			0
we ignore history at our peril .			0
