a drunken man in @entity1 staggers all over the footpath before clinging onto a railing for dear life in this video as some observers in a nearby house record him in his inebriated state			1
the man , dressed in a red t - shirt and navy shorts , looks like he is trying to walk somewhere but every time he tries to walk forward he loses his balance and he has to hastily retreat and grab the railing			2
at the start of the video the man is having such difficulty walking up the footpath it looks like he is walking on black ice			0
one of the men who is recording the footage says : ' oh he 's going backwards , oh do n't hit your head			0
' on five occasions the man tries walking forward during the two minute video but each time he reaches a stage where his legs seem to take on a life of their own			0
the revellers in the nearby house laugh incessantly as the drunken man fails to walk forward time and time again			2
one man sings mockingly , ' cause i take one step forward and two steps back , ' during one of the drunken individual 's more spectacular unsuccessful attempts			1
moments later the drunken man clings to the railing once again and falls to his knees			0
pensive : the man gathers his thoughts before he tries to walk forward wobbly : as the man walks forward his legs start to wobble like jelly balance : the inebriated man 's balance is also very poor and he constantly loses his footing railing : the man constantly leans on the barrier as he uses it as a crutch to stay upright stumble : the man , who is trying to walk in @entity1 , stumbles numerous times during the short video break : the man appears to take a break for a few moments at one stage while leaning on the railing quicksand : the man 's ability to walk is so hazardous it looks like he is walking on quicksand at times sleep : the drunken man looks tired and he puts his head bag momentarily as he tries one last attempt			1
