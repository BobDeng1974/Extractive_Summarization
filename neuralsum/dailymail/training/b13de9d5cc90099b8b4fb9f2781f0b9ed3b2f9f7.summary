by @entity0 for @entity1 the vast majority of @entity4 think president @entity5 should not go around @entity6 to make changes to immigration policy , a new poll shows			1
president @entity5 has promised to act on immigration by the end of the summer , regardless of @entity6 ' progress on legislative reforms			1
but a survey released today by the polling company , inc. / woman @entity14 shows that just two in 10 @entity4 think @entity5 should bypass the deliberative body and go it alone			2
a resounding 74 percent said the president ought to work with @entity6 to repair the system			2
even the majority of @entity21 - 56 percent - said @entity5 should not take executive action			1
teamwork : the vast majority of @entity4 think @entity5 should wait for @entity6 to act on immigration reform rather than take matters into his own hands even the majority of @entity21 want @entity5 to play nice with @entity6 on the issue of immigration nearly two - thirds of likely voters said they also disagreed with the way @entity5 was handling immigration in general , including 55 percent hispanics who were polled			1
@entity6 is currently out of session , and members are not slated to return to @entity36 until the second week of september on the table when @entity6 left for its annual august recess were two immigration bills : one that would change a law that prevents the @entity4 from sending immigrant children from @entity44 home immediately while giving agencies that handle immigration slightly more funding and another that would stop the president from using executive orders to provide amnesty to groups of illegal immigrants			1
both bills passed in the @entity55 - led @entity54 after the @entity56 had already left town			0
neither bill has a chance of making it to the @entity21 - controlled @entity56 floor when lawmakers return , however			0
more than a year ago the @entity56 passed legislation that would make sweeping changes to @entity4 immigration policies			2
however , house speaker @entity66 , a @entity55 , has unequivocally said he will not allow the bill to come his chamber 's floor			0
@entity66 and the bulk of the @entity55 caucus in the @entity54 prefer a step - by - step approach to immigration reform			2
with the two legislative bodies unable to agree on how to fix the ailing immigration system , immigration reform is largely at a standstill unless the president makes good on his threat			0
among the actions @entity5 is considering is providing work visas to the parents and guardians of children who are legal @entity4 residents			1
the president also wants to expand his @entity88 program , first established in 2012 , that allows illegal aliens who were brought to the @entity4 as children to stay in the country indefinitely			2
@entity55 blame that policy for the flood of immigrant children who have shown up at the @entity4 ' southern border in the 10 months			1
already , more than 57,000 unaccompanied immigrant children , many of whom are @entity44 , have come to the @entity4 border expecting amnesty since the end of the last fiscal year			0
as many as 90,000 could arrive in the @entity4 before october , government officials say			0
as the law is currently written , only children from @entity104 and @entity105 who come to the @entity4 illegally can be sent home immediately			0
children arriving from @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 must be processed by three federal agencies and given court dates before they can be returned to their home countries			0
likely voters also think the government should send illegal immigrant children back home only 22 percent of @entity4 think the government should relocate illegal immigrant children pouring over the @entity4 ' southern border to communities across the nation @entity55 - and the @entity5 administration - would like to see changes to the law to allow @entity44 children to be deported more quickly			1
today 's the polling , inc. survey suggests that most @entity4 would support those reforms			0
two - thirds of respondents said the government should send unaccompanied minors ' back to their home countries to convince stop sending their children here			1
' a mere 22 percent said the government should ' relocate them to communities across the @entity4 to provide them safe shelter			1
' the @entity55 aligned polling firm also found that the majority of people of all political persuasions support both of @entity54 @entity55 ' immigration bills			0
an overwhelming number of respondents to the survey also said they did not think that immigrants who wrongly enter the country should be given legal status			0
a concern of many survey - takers was job security and the threat that illegal immigrants would take jobs away from low - wage @entity4 workers			0
a total of 74 percent of respondents said that the government has a ' responsibility ' to ' protect ' unemployed and low - income @entity4 from ' competition with illegal immigrants for jobs			1

the majority of @entity55 , *independents* and even @entity21 think he should work with @entity6 to make changes to immigration policy
only 22 percent of respondents said the government should relocate illegal children to communities across the nation rather than send them home
nearly two - thirds of all @entity4 think @entity5 is *mishandling* immigration
