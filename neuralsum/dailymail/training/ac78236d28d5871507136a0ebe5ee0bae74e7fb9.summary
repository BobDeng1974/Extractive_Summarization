ms @entity6 , from @entity2 , said : ‘ i chose to do it as i love swimming and i have been wanting to get into performing for quite a while			1
this seemed like the perfect opportunity - it ’s something different and quite unusual			0
@entity6 , 25 , was diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2010			1
she has had two operations and is now fully recovered			1
after her treatment , she decided to pursue her dream of becoming a real - life mermaid ‘ i was pretty tentative the first time i got in the water because after two surgeries my nose and sinuses will never be the same , and i was n’t sure how they ’d react to the pressure of being underwater but it ’s given me no problems			0
’ ms @entity6 was diagnosed with a rare benign tumour of the pituitary gland , known as thyrotropinoma , as she finished her final year of university in 2010			1
she had surgery in 2011 to remove the tumour but it started to grow back so she had to have a second operation in january this year , she has now made a full recovery			1
she explained : ‘ i had lots of health issues when i was at university			0
i was really tired , my hair was falling out and i bruised really easily			1
‘ i did swimming because it was one of the only forms of exercise i could do			0
it has been really helpful in my recovery			0
‘ i ’m stronger than i have been in years			0
swimming underwater is very zen , the rest of the world is blocked out and everything is just calm and peaceful			0
ms @entity6 was diagnosed after she became very tired and noticed that her hair was falling out			1
she also found that her skin was bruising very easily			1
she was found to have a pituitary gland tumour ms @entity6 ( pictured recovering from surgery in hospital ) says she was worried that her nose and sinuses would struggle with the increased pressure under water because of the surgery ms @entity6 said : ' i definitely do n't think my degree has been put to waste			1
people may perceive accountancy as a more worthwhile career to pursue after graduation , but i feel that both of my careers are valuable ' ‘ the motivation of wanting to perfect swimming in a tail and monofin in order to start performing underwater was also really important in helping me regain my strength			2
’ ms @entity6 has teamed - up with @entity75 , a fellow @entity2 graduate , and friend @entity77 , 25 , and together they take to the water as a pod of mermaids			1
they train for up to ten hours a week in freezing lakes before dazzling crowds with their skills as they swim and sing at events across the country , including parties and black tie balls			1

different people have different reactions			0

‘ people may perceive accountancy as a more worthwhile career to pursue after graduation , but i feel that both of my careers are valuable in different ways			0
‘ the majority of people do n’t directly use their degrees in their future professional life - they use the transferable skills you develop through completing a degree			0
’ a thyrotropinoma is a pituitary tumour that secretes a hormone called thyroid - stimulating hormone			2
an excess of this hormone caused hyperthyroidism which can be serious			0
thyrotropinomas are very rare - they represent just one or two per cent of all benign pituitary tumours			2
symptoms include irritability , nervousness , sweating , tremors , difficulty sleeping , weight loss , brittle hair and thinning of the skin			2
treatment options include surgery to remove the tumour , radiation therapy and medication .			2
