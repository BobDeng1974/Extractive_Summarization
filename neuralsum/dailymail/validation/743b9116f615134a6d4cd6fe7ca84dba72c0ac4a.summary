shadow health secretary @entity0 has demanded full details of the reports be published , after they were leaked to the @entity3 @entity5 bosses have been accused of covering up plans to close @entity8 units and cut hospital beds – after paying £ 10million for reports they are now refusing to publish			1
they have paid management consultants including @entity13 a total of £ 10,282,593 for advice on ‘ improving long - term affordability ’ across 11 regions that cover 13million people			1
the @entity3 has seen a leaked copy of one of the secret reports , recommending the closure of all emergency services at one hospital and the removal of potentially hundreds of beds , sparking fears of plans for widespread cuts in other areas			0
such concerns are stoked by an official , watered - down summary of the project , which mentions the need for ‘ tough decisions ’ to balance the books in the 11 ‘ challenged ’ areas , where budgets are being overspent			1
using business jargon , it speaks of ‘ service reconfiguration ’ – which critics say is code for cuts – and ‘ rationalising the [ @entity5 ] estate ’ , or selling off hospital buildings and land			0
but nowhere in the @entity49 paper , partly commissioned by @entity50 , are any details spelled out			2
shadow health secretary @entity0 last night demanded the full details be published before the election , saying : ‘ the public , who have paid for these reports , have a right to see them before they go to vote			1
health secretary @entity59 likes to lecture the @entity5 about transparency , but it is clear he does n’t put his money where his mouth is			1
he must make immediate arrangements to publish all of these reports or people will conclude he ’s a hypocrite			2
’ @entity13 , whose advisers include former @entity5 chief executive sir @entity70 , was paid to produce two of the 11 reports last year			1
the @entity3 has seen the one covering @entity73 , which was leaked to a @entity75 mp			1
it said @entity5 managers should ‘ investigate the feasibility ’ of stripping @entity78 hospital of all its emergency services – including the @entity8 department – and turning it into ‘ an elective and rehabilitation centre ’			0
@entity13 also recommended closing hospital beds there and in @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88 to plug a potential £ 217million black hole			2
if similar suggestions have been made for the other ten areas , @entity5 managers will be considering plans to close numerous a&es and potentially thousands of hospital beds			0
however , @entity50 has refused to publish the 11 reports , despite admitting there is ‘ in general a strong public interest in information being made as freely available as possible ’			1
a leaked copy of one of 11 secret reports recommended the closure of all emergency services at one hospital and the removal of potentially hundreds of beds instead , it has answered a freedom of information request from @entity3 , which has campaigned for more than two years to save casualty departments , by arguing that releasing them now would ‘ prejudice the outcome ’ of work to draw up five - year plans for the areas			1
‘ for these reasons , we believe withholding the information outweighs the public interest in releasing the information			2
’ in the same response , @entity50 admitted how much it spent			0
@entity78 hospital supporter @entity122 believed it highly likely that management consultants had recommended closures elsewhere too			0
‘ that seems to be the remit they were given , ’ he said			0
despite the terrible history of @entity131 , where hundreds are thought to have died in the 2000s due to poor care , the town has rallied to save its departments from the axe			0
the other ten areas are : @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 & @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 , and @entity148			0
@entity13 confirmed it worked on two reports			2
a spokeswoman added : ‘ any further enquiries on the recommendations should be directed to the client			0
