' you are not a man of good character because in 2008 you were reprimanded for committing a similar , if not identical , offence with another vulnerable woman , ' the judge said			2
' if you needed reminding that such behaviour was totally unacceptable , that incident should have deterred you			0
' however , in may 2012 , you met up with one victim			2
she was the victim of domestic violence , as had been the victim in 2008			1
' she was looking for the protection of the law and the understanding of the police			2
you chose to seduce her when she was at her most vulnerable			0
' later , when the affair had come to an end you misused police data to discover her private phone number			2
' prosecuting , @entity81 said @entity1 met his first victim in may 2012 , after being called to her home to attend a domestic violence incident			1
@entity1 ' immediately ' began complimenting the woman and later contacted her on @entity86			2
the former officer , who served with @entity89 police , would visit the women - who he was seeing at the same time - while on duty			1
he also called a police car to come and collect him following a meeting ' she was vulnerable having suffered years of abuse from her partner , mr @entity1 gave her compliments and support , ' ms @entity81 said			1
' a sexual relationship began very soon afterwards			0

' in december 2012 , the command and control logs were accessed by mr @entity1 and he obtained her phone number , ' ms @entity81 said			1
' he sent her a text message minutes later			0
' in a victim impact statement , the woman said : ' as painful as it is to look back , when i think of the mental state i was in at the time i feel sick at how the authority figure in our community took advantage of me when he should have protected me			0
' the court heard how @entity1 met with a second victim in june 2012 following a neighbourly dispute at her home - which resulted in a trial			1
this meeting was while he was in a relationship with the first woman , the court heard			0

' he asked if he could kiss her and the relationship progressed			0
on a number of occasions she wrote in her journal and she recorded when sexual activity took place			0

' the relationship ended in june 2013 , when the woman discovered @entity1 was engaged to be married to another woman , ms @entity81 said			1
in a victim impact statement read to the court , the woman said : ' i thought i was safe with him but he left me with an enduring belief that the old stereotype of dodgy policemen is still very much alive and kicking , especially when it comes to vulnerable women			1
' my feelings are unsurprisingly more emotional , i feel rejected - why did he do this ? for kicks or thrills while supposedly on police duty ? ' the court heard how the man had previous relations with a domestic violence victim in 2008 judge @entity56 added : ' the case was compromised when it came to trial because the defendant let it be known that you were having an affair with the prosecution witness			1
' as a result , the case had to be dropped , although a restraining order was imposed			0
nothing could demonstrate better why police officers have to conduct themselves in a exemplary manner			0
' both your victims feel extremely let down by the police			0
you targeted women when they were at their most vulnerable			0
you carried out the affairs while actually on duty			0
' your behaviour has brought the police service into disrepute			0

he said @entity1 had previously been married but wed his new wife following the end of his relationship with the second victim in june last year			2
the relationship with his first victim ended in august 2012 , when she went on holiday with her children , mr @entity192 explained			2
' he is someone who has shown deep remorse and shame for his behaviour , he does n’t try to excuse it , ' mr @entity192 said			0
' he is not someone who has set out with a specific sinister agenda			0
' mr @entity192 said his client , father to his 11 - year - old daughter , no longer works for the police force			2
