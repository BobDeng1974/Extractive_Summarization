by @entity0 and @entity1 lungs from heavy smokers should be more widely used in transplants to boost the number of life - saving operations taking place , says a leading charity			1
despite the increased risks of getting cancer , doctors argue more patients with terminal illnesses , such as cystic fibrosis , should be given the choice of having ‘ reconditioned ’ lungs from a smoker or older person , which can give them years of extra life			1
dozens of patients in @entity23 die every year while waiting for ‘ perfect ’ lungs , they say , when their lives would be prolonged if surgeons were able to use more ‘ sub-optimal ’ organs			1
some people often have to wait many years for an organ transplant , and some say relaxing the rules regarding lungs of smokers may help those on the donor waiting list the proposals have been drawn up by transplant surgeons and the @entity39 , who are writing to health secretary @entity41 to try to persuade him to relax guidelines that control the quality of donor lungs			1
smokers ’ lungs are already used in four in ten transplant operations in @entity23			2
but researchers say this could be increased to more than half if doctors were less selective			0
@entity51 , professor of respiratory transplant medicine at @entity53 , said lungs from the heaviest smokers could be used more frequently			2
he added : ‘ common sense suggests accepting lungs from a donor who smokes ca n’t be healthy			2
‘ but what is more risky ? to wait for a “ perfect lung ” that may never arrive , or take one that may not be ideal ? ’ he said evidence showed patients who received a smoker ’s lungs were 20 per cent less likely to die within three years than those who stayed on the waiting list			1
prof @entity51 said technological advances meant poorer - quality lungs could be reconditioned using a machine he has helped create			1
these can become severely damaged through heavy smoking he said : ‘ the ex-vivo lung perfusion machine improves condition of the organ by exposing them to a nutrient solution and oxygen			0
’ but the appeal comes just 18 months after cystic fibrosis sufferer @entity84 , 27 , died of lung cancer following a double transplant			0
she was told the lungs came from a heavy smoker only after the cancer was spotted			2
last night her widower @entity91 , 29 , said : ‘ we should not prevent someone from becoming a donor , smokers included			0
but we must ensure the transplant process is totally transparent			0
’ he said they were told @entity84 had the killer disease months after the transplant they thought would save her			0
‘ we were incredulous this had n’t been mentioned before her transplant			0
@entity84 spent seven months enduring gruelling cancer treatment and died a painful , tortuous death			0
’ the charity also wants lungs from elderly donors to be used more .			1

leading charity says people should be more open to different lungs
@entity39 ' reconditioned lungs ' should be an option
dozens of patients die each year waiting for the ' perfect lungs '
the trust says that the option would help people live longer
