' attack : separatist insurgents in the @entity8 city of @entity37 smash up machines in a gambling club violence : the militias have increasingly begun to dominate parts of eastern @entity8 uncompromising : the insurgents have expressed their opposition to control from the government in @entity43 his announcement was a response to @entity4 sanctions which will deny export licences for any high - technology items that could aid @entity5 military capabilities			1

' it is one thing to introduce sanctions regarding people so that they do not come and not to issue visas but to land forcefully a plane with several members of the @entity5 government on board using military aviation is beyond jokes and various half - serious conversations			0
