@entity0 believes @entity1 will be classed alongside his boyhood hero @entity2 in the pantheon of all - time @entity5 greats should he claim his third world championship			1
@entity1 enters the new campaign , which gets underway in @entity8 on sunday , as the favourite to defend the crown he clinched so dramatically at the season finale in @entity12 last year			0
speaking at @entity14 headquarters in @entity15 last week , @entity1 spoke of his motivation to emulate @entity2 by winning a third world title			2
@entity1 could become an all - time @entity5 great if he secures a third world championship @entity1 wants to emulate boyhood hero @entity20 and @entity0 said he could with another title @entity1 ( centre ) with @entity5 legend @entity23 ( left ) and @entity24 in 2011 when he was with @entity25 and @entity0 believes the 30 - year - old @entity26 must be considered in the same bracket as the great @entity28 , and sir @entity23 , also a thrice - world champion , should he defend his title in 2015			1
' if @entity1 had finished his career with one championship it would have been a travesty , but if he wins a third he is up there with sir @entity23 and @entity2 ' , said @entity0 , a veteran of 156 grands prix			1
' he becomes one of the all - time greats			1
' @entity1 and team - mate @entity38 are expected to renew their battle for the championship with @entity14 the class of the field in pre-season testing			0
the @entity47 , winners of 16 of the 19 races last year , boasted more mileage than any of their rivals over the winter , with the apparent pace to match			0
the @entity47 won 16 of the 19 races last year and boasted more mileage than of their rivals over winter @entity1 and team - mate @entity38 ( left ) will renew their battle for the championship in @entity57 but @entity1 's preparations for the new term have been hampered by his very public break - up from girlfriend @entity61 , the popstar singer who was in @entity12 to celebrate his title triumph last year			1
@entity0 however , does n't expect @entity1 's off - track issues to trouble him as it has appeared to do so in the past			2
' i think he will be in a better place			0
i sense he is hungry and i think the @entity61 thing happened a lot time before it became public , ' said @entity0			2
@entity1 's preparations were hampered by his public split from @entity61 , who was in @entity12 to celebrate his second championship victory with @entity1 @entity0 does n't believe @entity1 's off - track issues will be a problem - ' i think he will be in a better place ' ' there is no doubt about it , that he wears his heart on his sleeve and he very open about that , but his speed and his skill are so great he just drives through that			1
' he has got to win consecutive championships which is always perceived to be particularly difficult , but he is going to have a dominant car again , so it is @entity38 who he has got to race			0
' @entity1 was unlucky with reliability last year and if he just does the same thing again he will beat @entity38			0
so , unless @entity38 has found a way to raise his game , what is going to put @entity1 under pressure apart from himself ? ' @entity94 is the only place fans can watch all 20 @entity96 weekends live across tv , @entity98 and @entity99			0

@entity1 said he wanted to emulate his boyhood hero @entity2
@entity0 said a third title would place him among @entity94 's all - time greats
@entity0 said another win puts @entity1 with @entity2 and sir @entity23
he does n't believe public split with @entity61 will be a problem
