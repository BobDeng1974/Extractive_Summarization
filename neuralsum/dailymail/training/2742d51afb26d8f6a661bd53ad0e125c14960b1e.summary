turn the other wheat : @entity15 is n't selling their famed toaster on @entity8 anymore but they are selling it on their own website but according to the toaster company , they are a small business that does n't appreciate the fact @entity8 withholds half of their company 's sales while @entity8 ' reviews their account			1
' according to the @entity9 toaster company , @entity8 also takes $ 8.00 for every toaster they sell and they take 15 per cent of sale proceeds including the shipping charges			1

personal popper : @entity15 also sells toasters that imprint different symbols like the @entity82 symbol shown here ' it will be felt for sure ; they are a huge resource of millions of customers , but at this point i am feeling confident we can use the thousands of dollars @entity8 makes off our toasters each year to successfully promote sales on our website			1
