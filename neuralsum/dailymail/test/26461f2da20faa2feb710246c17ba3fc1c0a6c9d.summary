an amateur cyclist is planning to ride the entire @entity2 - considered the most gruelling race in professional cycling - on a @entity4			1
@entity5 has put in months of training aboard his bright yellow @entity8 in preparation to ride all 2077 miles of the 2015 @entity2 route this summer			1
the 36 - year - old personal trainer from @entity12 , @entity13 , is hoping his stunt will inspire people to get out and ride themselves			1
he now hopes to cycle the entire @entity2 the tour involves many hill climbs which are grueling even for professionals using high - performance road bikes mr @entity5 and two others , who are using proper road bikes , attempt a hill climb in @entity26 last year mr @entity5 said his chopper is as close to standard as possible , but required a better seat and tweaked brakes mr @entity5 said his chopper - the 2004 revival of the iconic 1970 's children 's bike - is as close to standard as possible			1
he said : ' i 've tried to make as few changes as possible so it 's got the original tyres			0
' the main thing i 've changed is the seat post and the pedal arms as it was originally designed for kids			2
' and the wheels - on the first part of the race through @entity26 , there are a lot of sections of really terrible cobbles , so a guy made me some really strong wheels as i kept breaking spokes			0
' i 've also had to put slightly better brakes on as well			0
' up the biggest climbs it gets a bit grim , it was just two degrees at the top of one , the @entity55 - it took me forever to get down , i was almost hypothermic at the bottom			0
' while it 's by far the longest ride he 's attempted , mr @entity5 has completed long rides on the chopper before			1
mr @entity5 attempted the @entity17 on the @entity4 last year and finished in the top 20 per cent mr @entity5 hopes his audacious attempt to ride the @entity2 will inspire others to take up cycling pictured left , mr @entity5 stands with others riding the @entity17			1
right , he is pictured with his chopper in the @entity70 he said : ' i did the @entity17 last year it 's a mass start event where thousands do a stage of the @entity2 on closed roads			1
' lots of people did n't think i could do it , but i thought , why not have a go ? ' i did really well , got a really good time , i was in the top 20 per cent , so the next morning , i thought about doing the full tour			2
' i thought , if i could do one day , is it possible to do the whole tour ? ' after the etape i should n't have wanted to even see a chopper again , but it was a bit of a @entity89 moment , that 's where it came from			2
' i come from a cycling family , my mum and dad would take me to see the @entity17 , riding up mountains is in my blood			0
' it 's always been a bit of a dream to ride the @entity2 , i wo n't do it again , my dad said he never would have thought i 'd do it on a chopper ! ' he said : ' part of the motivation was to show people you do n't need a £ 10,000 bike to do amazing things on - my bike cost me £ 100 , and i 'm doing the tour on it			1
with a bike , it 's mostly to do with the engine			0
' in the last five years the cost of road cycling has sky rocketed but you do n't need all that , you just need to get out and ride			0
' the other side of the challenge is to raise as much money for @entity123 as possible			0
' mr @entity5 also hopes his stunt will raise as much money as possible for charity help for heroes			2
