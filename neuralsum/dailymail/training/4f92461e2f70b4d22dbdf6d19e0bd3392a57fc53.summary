@entity0 said members of the armed forces ' acted wrongly ' one family has already rejected the offer and is determined to take the soldiers to court by @entity7 last updated at 11:15 pm on 22nd september 2011 families of demonstrators killed or wounded on @entity11 are to be paid compensation , it was disclosed yesterday			1
@entity0 officials have written to lawyers for victims ’ families promising payments and the ministry said it intended to deal with claims as quickly as possible			1
the payments – which are likely to total about £ 10million – may at last bring to an end the expensive legal wrangling over the killing of 14 people in @entity24 by soldiers of the @entity26 in january 1972			1
carnage : soldiers face the crowd in the @entity11 riot in @entity24 , @entity31 @entity11 became a spur to @entity34 recruiting over the 25 years of violence that followed			1
@entity37 apologised for the shootings last year after the publication of the @entity41 report into @entity11			1
the report , which took 12 years and £ 200m to produce , found that ‘ out - of - control ’ paratroopers had engaged in an indefensible shooting spree			1
@entity46 chaired the @entity41 in the 15 months since the prime minister ’s apology , prosecutors in @entity31 appear to have made no progress towards any prosecution of the soldiers involved , and a criminal trial is widely regarded as an impossibility 40 years after the event			1
the @entity0 indicated its intention to pay compensation in a reply to law firm @entity59 , which represents many of the families			1
the firm asked what the government was doing to compensate victims ’ families ‘ for the loss of their loved ones , the wounding of others , and the shameful allegations which besmirched their good name for many years ’			1
there was no indication of the likely scale of the payments yesterday			2
one pointer may be the amount of compensation paid to the family of solicitor @entity59 , founder of @entity59 and @entity83 , following his murder by loyalist gunmen in front of his wife and three children at their @entity90 home in 1989			1
according to documents later published by the @entity93 , mr @entity83 ’s widow @entity91 was paid £ 500,000 under the @entity94			2
celebration : @entity96 , whose brother @entity97 was shot on @entity11 , holds his arms aloft after the @entity41 concluded @entity100 soldiers had acted unlawfully occasion : thousands packed the square outside @entity24 's @entity104 to await the verdict of the @entity41 1972 @entity11 massacre where civilians were killed by soldiers of the 1st @entity26 during a civil rights march in @entity111 's inquiry heard testimonies from the soldiers , who claimed they had been shot at , while the marchers insisted that no one from the march was armed			1
@entity117 produced a report that took the army 's side			2
1998 @entity121 said a new inquiry would be held2000 the @entity41 opened properly in 2000 when formal public hearings began at the @entity104 in @entity24			2
the @entity41 held public hearings on 116 days over the year , clocking up more than 600 hours of evidence			2
2004 judges retired on 23 november 2004			2
they reconvened once again on 16 december to listen to testimony from another key witness.2010 @entity41 was handed to government lawyers on 24 march 2010 , twelve years after the inquiry was established.2009 the chairman of the inquiry , @entity46 , revealed that the inquiry would be handed to the government in march 2010 , some 9 years after the first evidence was heard ; a delay which @entity46 admitted was ' extremely disappointing '			2
2010 the report of the inquiry was published on 15 june 2010 and thousands of people walked the path that the civil rights marchers had taken on @entity11 before they were shot at			0
payments at a similar level would suggest a compensation bill to taxpayers totalling around £ 10m – a small sum compared with the cost of the @entity148 inquiry			0
swift compensation payments could also avoid political rows which might threaten to upset @entity31 ’s fragile peace			0
but yesterday , sisters @entity152 and @entity154 , whose teenage brother @entity155 was among those who died , said they found the idea of compensation ‘ repulsive ’ and would refuse any payment			0
@entity159 added : ‘ not under any circumstances will i ever accept money for the loss of my brother			0
‘ i find it repulsive taking anything from the @entity0 ' i 've already told my legal team i want to go forward with prosecutions			1
' miss @entity159 noted that @entity100 in the early 1970s had offered her mother a cursory compensation payment of £ 250			0
' she did n't take it then and i will be doing the same , ' she said			0
@entity11 changed the course of the violence that erupted in @entity31 in the late 1960s and helped to make 1972 the deadliest year of the ' @entity174 '			0
troops opened fire after a march descended into rioting in the @entity179 , a nationalist area of @entity24			0
they killed 13 people and wounded 14 others , one of whom died later			0
unionists warned last month against ' rewriting the history of the @entity174 ' by portraying @entity100 forces as the only guilty party during the conflict			1
the @entity41 , authorised by former prime minister @entity121 in the immediate build - up to the @entity190 peace accord of 1998 , was empowered to find the truth behind the @entity193 's worst act of violence in @entity31			0
families of the dead had demanded such a probe for decades			0
the investigation produced a 5,000 - page report based on evidence from 921 witnesses , 2,500 written statements and 60 volumes of written evidence			0
@entity46 gave the ex-paratroopers , now in their 60s and 70s , broad protections from criminal charges as well as anonymity in the witness box , citing the risk that @entity34 dissidents might target them in retaliation			0
but legal experts say wiggle room remains for prosecutions and , more likely , civil lawsuits against the retired soldiers , particularly those who were found to have lied during their testimony .			1
