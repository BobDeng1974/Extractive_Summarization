where suspects have been arrested but not charged , she said , they could be named if it was in the ‘ public interest ’ – a broad definition that does not tie police hands			1
forces have been justifying the new policy by quoting the @entity37 report on @entity38 said that , save in exceptional circumstances , ‘ the names or identifying details or those who are arrested or suspected of a crime should not be released to the press or public ’			2

‘ i strongly believe that there should be no right to anonymity at charge apart from in extremely unusual circumstances			0
‘ i believe that there should be a right to anonymity at arrest , but i know that there will be circumstances in which the public interest means that an arrested suspect should be named			0
