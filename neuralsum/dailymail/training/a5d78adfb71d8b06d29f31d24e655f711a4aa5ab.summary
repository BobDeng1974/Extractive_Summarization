by @entity0 published : 23:38 est , 14 august 2013 updated : 03:56 est , 15 august 2013 motorists lucky to be in a location with plenty of fuel suppliers paid less drivers are having to put up with a ' @entity8 ' attitude to petrol pricing based on their location , the @entity5 has warned			1
some towns are charging far more for petrol and diesel than others and there are even ' pump price dogfights ' within some cities , the @entity5 said			1
it warned that motorists were charged more when there was no competition between retailers in some locations			1
however , motorists lucky to be in a location with plenty of fuel suppliers could paid less because retailers would competitively drop their prices to lure in sales			1
it reported that the surge in @entity31 petrol prices had slowed but the current average price , at 137.52p a litre , was still 1.74p a litre higher than a month ago			1
the @entity5 said : ' the average hides the @entity8 nature of @entity31 fuel pricing , where prices in some towns have gone up substantially more - some places passing on the full 5p - a - litre lift in wholesale prices during early july			1
' this has forced drivers in communities of tens of thousands of people to pay above - average prices for the cheapest petrol locally , even at the supermarket			0
' cheapest petrol at 137.9p a litre is common in many small market and coastal towns			2
' the @entity5 went on : ' the presence of a competitive retailer is dividing some cities			0
some towns are charging far more for petrol and diesel than others and there are even ' pump price dogfights ' within some cities the @entity5 warned the presence of a competitive retailer is dividing some cities ' in @entity70 ( in @entity69 ) , a supermarket and two non-supermarket retailers on the west side engaged in a pump price dogfight at the start of this week , charging 132.9p for petrol			2
' to the east of the city , without a competitive rival , supermarkets were charging 134.9p and 135.9p a litre			0
' in neighbouring towns @entity81 and @entity82 , supermarket petrol cost 136.9p			2
' the @entity5 said the average cost of diesel has risen from 140.24p a litre in mid-july to 141.87 now			0
@entity87 now costs nearly 1.5p more than a year ago			2
regionally , @entity88 has reinforced its position as the area of the @entity31 with the cheapest average price for petrol , at 136.9p a litre			0
this is 1.5p lower than @entity95 ( 138.4p ) which is the most expensive region			0
@entity97 , averaging 142.7p a litre , pays the most for diesel while the @entity99 shares the cheapest slot with @entity101 and @entity102 , both averaging 141.4p			0
@entity5 public affairs head @entity103 said : ' recent wholesale price falls and evidence of individual non-supermarket retailers undercutting the superstores suggest the @entity31 fuel price climate is cooling enough for some welcome respite for drivers			0
' it 's probably too soon to expect a price war to break out , but a bit of late summer pump relief for holiday motorists would n't go amiss - so long as it is n't restricted to towns with competitive supermarkets			1

' @entity8 ' pricing means fuel costs surge in some towns
