when @entity1 revealed the intimate details of her 5:2 marriage she drew gasps from married couples and staunch monogamists			1
for the author of @entity8 described how , for a year , she would spend weekdays sleeping with strangers and weekends with her husband of 17 years , @entity11			1
at the time , the dramatic move was a bid to save their relationship after @entity11 had a vasectomy , but now he 's spoken out to say that he never wanted to see other people			1
' it was n't something i wanted to do , ' the brewer and wine - maker told @entity37			1
' i did n't like the idea of opening up our marriage			1
but if i did n't do it , i felt we were heading for divorce , so i thought why not take the chance and maybe we can come out the other side ? ' his premonition was correct a ultimately the decision led to the end of their marriage and @entity1 getting together with one of her lovers			1
@entity11 says that while he understood his wife 's desire to experience sexual relationships with other people - he himself had enjoyed a promiscuous youth - he had always felt it might spell trouble for their marriage			1
and it seems the question of whether or not to have children had always been an issue for the couple with @entity11 being firmly against the idea			1
@entity68 : after @entity1 's year of uninhibited encounters , she was unable to rekindle her loving marriage with @entity71 , and the two now have different partners however , he defends himself in the new interview , revealing that he had always been honest with @entity1 about his desires and intentions			1
' is it cruel to not change your mind about something you believe in ? ' he said of fatherhood , ' i do n't think @entity1 ever thought i was being cruel			1
at any point she could have left me and found somebody else to have a child with or i could have left her and found somebody who was n't going to bother me about it			2
' during the course of the year - long experiment he revealed that he dated a handful of women , however , he only slept with one of them			1
account : @entity1 describes every step of the ' project ' in intimate detail in her newly - released book , @entity8 they had a six month relationship before he eventually called it off			1
and @entity11 says it was flattering to get attention from other women			1
he said : ' i enjoyed the feeling of being attracted to other women and getting good feedback			2
i had a couple of women who said to me : ' i ca n't believe your wife would risk losing you , you 're such an awesome guy , ' so when you hear that , you know , it makes you feel pretty good			1
' today he 's in a long term relationship with his girlfriend @entity117 , who he lives with and the former couple consider themselves at peace			2
in @entity1 's book she declares , ' i refuse to go to my grave with no children and only four lovers			1
' but during her year of promiscuity in 2008 , she made up for lost time , sleeping with ten men and two women			2
appearing on @entity131 's @entity130 yesterday , @entity1 opened up about her unorthodox decision , which she says was triggered by her husband 's vasectomy			1
' i would say before the year i was in a somewhat inhibited but satisfied , normal loving relationship			2
' but when i got into my early 40s my husband got a vasectomy and i knew the discussion of having a baby was over , which kick - started this experience			0
' ' i looked forward to my death bed and thought			0
" what will i have ? " i wo n’t have children and grandchildren			0
will i at least have lived fully ? " ' ' if i could n’t have one i wanted the other , ' she explained			2
' like a lot of women at that age i was hitting my confidence and sexual peak and suddenly realised very dramatically that i was n’t going to have children			0
it was the perfect storm			0
' i have had lots of people telling me i should have travelled the world , tried painting classes or cooking – but i already know how to cook ! ' ' wild oats ' : @entity1 , 50 , negotiated an open marriage with her husband of 17 years , which allowed her to bed 12 strangers in 12 months - which ultimately broke her relationship she also said having ' very little sexual variety ' in her youth was a motivating factor , as the fact that she was living in @entity169 , which she described as ' a very liberal city '			1
' i was also at a marital crisis and was thinking about trying a partial separation , ' she said			0
' so i thought ok while we do that i need to sow some wild oats and let him do the same			0
' under the terms of her new deal , @entity1 took out an apartment , where she lived from monday to friday and would bed her conquests			1
but over the weekend she would go back to @entity71 , and the two would live as a married couple , without asking what the other had been doing while they were apart			0
' the ground rules were safe sex , not to get seriously involved with anyone and to refrain from mutual acquaintances , ' she explained			0
' but at the end of the year , we each broke two rules			2
' to find willing participants in her project @entity1 decided not to pick up men at bars , but to be more strategic in her search			2
' i was a very busy magazine editor working long hours and never in my life had i picked up a man at a bar or had a one night stand , ' she explains			2
so i felt like going about it in a more clear - headed , conscious way			0
' @entity1 posted an online ad , entitled @entity203			2
in the post , she wrote : ' i 'm a 44 - year - old professional , educated , attractive woman in an open marriage , seeking single men age 35 - 50 to help me explore my sexuality			1
' ' i said i wanted to meet in public for dinner and drinks			2
i explained that if it led to sex then great , but that i could n’t get seriously involved or see them more than a few times			0
' the next day , @entity1 had 23 offers			2
so would she advise it ? ‘ not if you want to stay married , ' she told @entity130 hosts @entity220 and @entity221			0
' read my book instead and have an armchair adventure			2
' ' i was well aware it would be very risky – but i did n’t think we had that much to lose			0
' this 5:2 idea of weekends together and weekdays apart was to put a bit of distance between us to see each other in a new light and add some sparkle			0
' that happened at first , ' she said , but admitted their sexual exploits ended up pushing them apart			0
' it was hard to put it all back in the box , ' she explained			0
