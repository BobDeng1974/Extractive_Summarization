tests have shown that @entity2 , who was born in 1993 , may suffer from a gene mutation that switches off her ability to mature			1
dr @entity28 is in the process of sequencing @entity2 ’s genome , which is comprised of two long strings of letters , one from the mother and one from the father			1
each string is three billion letters long , and changes in just one of these letters can lead to profound effects on development , physical appearance , and risk of disease			0
@entity98 love : tests have shown that @entity2 , who is three years older than her sister , may suffer from a gene mutation that switches off her ability to mature what went wrong ? doctors were trying to process of sequencing @entity2 's genome , which is comprised of two long strings of three billion letters @entity2 , a 20 - year - old woman trapped inside the body of a toddler			1
according to @entity109 , in the first six years of her life , @entity2 suffered series of medical emergencies from which she recovered , often without explanation			2

@entity2 has remained physically and cognitively similar to a toddler
no formal diagnosis for @entity2 ’s condition has ever been given , leading doctors to term her condition @entity2
doctors are sequencing her genome , in the hope of finding answers from a possible gene mutation that may have switched off her ability to mature
