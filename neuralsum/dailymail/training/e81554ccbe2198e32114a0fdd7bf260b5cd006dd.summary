@entity1 captain @entity0 has signed a new one - year contract extension			1
it had been reported that the @entity1 captain was so keen to stay at @entity5 that he was willing to accept a pay - cut , but the 33 - year - old now looks set to secure a deal somewhere close to his current Â£ 150,000 - a - week wage			1
speaking about his new deal , @entity0 told the official @entity1 website : ' i 'd like to thank the fans and club for their continued support , and the manager who was instrumental for me the last season			1
' @entity1 's chief executive @entity31 added : ' we are very pleased @entity0 , who is an undoubted @entity1 legend , will continue to lead the team next season , as he has done for so many years with unrivalled achievement			0
' both @entity1 and @entity0 have been clear throughout that we wanted his outstanding career at the club to continue , and it is important the matter has been concluded so soon after the end of the season , allowing us to look forward to and plan for 2014/15			0
' @entity1 boss @entity18 will have been just as desperate as @entity0 to hang onto the @entity45 veteran after one of his best seasons in a blue shirt			0
@entity45 brother : the @entity1 board were confident that @entity0 would be signing a new deal although @entity0 was attracting interest from clubs across @entity54 , the @entity1 board were always confident that the former @entity56 captain would sign a new deal			2
there had been question marks over the futures of @entity0 , @entity20 and @entity21 , but @entity18 's first priority would surely have been to tie the former down for at least another year			2
although doubts still remain over the futures of @entity20 and @entity21 , @entity1 fans can at least count on their captain , leader , legend for another season			0
key man : @entity18 has secured the signature of his captain for another year one down : @entity18 wants @entity21 , @entity20 and @entity0 to stay at @entity1			1
