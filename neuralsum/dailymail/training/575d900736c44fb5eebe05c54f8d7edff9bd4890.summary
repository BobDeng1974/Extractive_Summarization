by @entity0 there is something very decadent and a little bit naughty about staying at a hotel in your home town			2
the idea that you could whizz your date upstairs at any point throughout dinner for a different kind of ' dessert ' adds a certain frisson to proceedings			0
in reality , a good hotel dinner means that you will probably overeat and drink just enough to find yourself fully clothed and snoozing though @entity18 as friday night comes to a close , rather than road testing the bedroom furniture			0
but the fact that you could be swinging from the spotlights remains			0
and the new rooms at @entity26 's @entity25 could be just the place to plan that sexy city rendez - vous			0
the @entity25 in @entity26 's @entity29 has had a revamp the design hotel has been a destination for the young , urban traveller for a while now thanks to its buzzing @entity29 location , @entity37 restaurant and pretty prices ( booked in advance rooms start at just £ 49 per night )			1
but in @entity26 keeping your cool is an ongoing operation , and with stylish new neighbours the @entity43 and @entity45 's @entity44 muscling in on it 's patch @entity48 has given itself a mini facelift to keep things interesting			1
on the friday night my husband and i stayed , the lobby ( which doubles as the bar and has recently been refreshed with new seating and lighting ) was jumping by the time we checked in at 7pm			1
weaving through the handsome but already loud crowd we winced inwardly as we remembered that we had forgotten to pack earplugs			0
and then winced at our wincing			0
what kind of old farts worry about the noise in a city centre hotel on a friday night ? we need n't have worried ( or winced ) though , @entity66 - as it likes to be known - might like to party , but it also knows that a good night 's sleep is key for busy girls and boys wanting to make the most of a city break , and our third room floor room was perfectly peaceful			1
as well as the ' @entity26 ' design touches like @entity76 and random collections of cool - looking books that you wo n't have time to read , the renovated rooms feature black out curtains , frette bedding , oversized mirrors and a perfectly - sized desk and tech area for all that @entity87 planning			1
leather armchairs , pop art prints and parquet flooring add a stylish touch to an affordable city room and the bathrooms are slick and sexy , decked out in dark grey and featuring low - level lighting			0
@entity26 cool : new bedrooms feature stylish touches and the bathrooms are sleek and simple as long - term @entity99 , instead of seizing the moment and exploring the area ( the hotel is brilliantly placed for @entity103 and the @entity104 , @entity106 market , @entity107 and @entity108 ) we seized a red leather booth three floors down to people watch as we ate dinner			1
downstairs the bar has been opened out to allow more beautiful things to come and hang while drinking @entity117			2
with the restaurant being so close to the bar the atmosphere and service was hectic - we were served by four different people over the course of the meal - but the diner - style food : fiery jalapeño bites followed by a perfect burger complete with secret sauce and crispy bacon for me , and a halloumi and chickpea salad ( generous on the cheese ) for the veggie , was delicious			2
to summarise the people - watching was top notch , the cocktails were top shelf ... and @entity141 were top lads on @entity18			0
what more could you ask for on a friday night ? the lobby has been opened out redecorated ready to receive more beautiful people rooms start at £ 49 and include a light breakfast delivered to your room			1
