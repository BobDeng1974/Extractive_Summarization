if you cry at sad scenes in films , tweet and post emotional links and jump to help the less fortunate , you could be genetically predisposed to ' sensory processing sensitivity ' , researchers say			0
@entity8 researchers have found that up to 20 % of people are affected , having a highly sensitive brain that responds to emotional images			1
the researchers used @entity13 scans to monitor the level of empathy - and say the emotion levels are particularly high if pictures of partners smiling are shown			1
highly sensitive people tend to show heightened awareness to subtle stimuli , process information more thoroughly , and be more reactive to both positive and negative stimuli , the researchers say			1
roughly 20 percent of the population is affected by sensory processing sensitivity ( @entity30 ) , an innate trait associated with greater sensitivity , or responsiveness , to environmental and social stimuli			0
highly sensitive people tend to show heightened awareness to subtle stimuli , process information more thoroughly , and be more reactive to both positive and negative stimuli , the researchers say			1
in contrast , the majority of people have comparatively low @entity30 and pay less attention to subtle stimuli , approach situations more quickly and are not as emotionally reactive			1
@entity42 psychologists @entity43 and @entity44 say roughly 20 percent of the population is affected by sensory processing sensitivity ( @entity30 ) , an innate trait associated with greater sensitivity , or responsiveness , to environmental and social stimuli			0
in a new study published in @entity49 , drs. @entity50 and colleagues at the @entity52 , @entity53 , and @entity54 found that @entity13 ( @entity13 ) of brains provide physical evidence that the ' highly sensitive ' brain responds powerfully to emotional images			1
according to dr. @entity50 , the trait is becoming increasingly associated with identifiable behaviors , genes , physiological reactions , and patterns of brain activation			0
highly sensitive people tend to show heightened awareness to subtle stimuli , process information more thoroughly , and be more reactive to both positive and negative stimuli , the researchers say			1
in contrast , the majority of people have comparatively low @entity30 and pay less attention to subtle stimuli , approach situations more quickly and are not as emotionally @entity68			1
@entity50 and colleagues used @entity13 brain scans to compare @entity71 with low @entity30 individuals			2
the analysis is the first with @entity13 to demonstrate how @entity76 ’ brain activity processes others ’ emotions			2
the brains of 18 married individuals ( some with high and some with low @entity30 ) were scanned as they viewed photos of either smiling faces , or sad faces			0
one set of photos included the faces of strangers , and the other set included photos of their husbands or wives			0
' we found that areas of the brain involved with awareness and emotion , particularly those areas connected with empathetic feelings , in the highly sensitive people showed substantially greater blood flow to relevant brain areas than was seen in individuals with low sensitivity during the twelve second period when they viewed the photos , ” said dr. @entity50 , a research professor in psychology at @entity42			1
sensory processing sensitivity ( @entity30 ) , an innate trait associated with greater sensitivity , or responsiveness , to environmental and social stimuli , affects 20 % of people , researchers say they are more likely to cry at sad scenes in films such as @entity116 , ( pictured ) a comparison of the brains of highly sensitive people ( @entity71 ) compared to non-hsps			1
the areas in color represent some of the regions of the brain where greater activation occurs in @entity71 compared to @entity126			0
the brain region highly associated with empathy and noticing emotion ( @entity130 ) shows significantly greater activation in @entity71 than non-hsps when viewing a photo of their partner smiling			2
' this is physical evidence within the brain that highly sensitive individuals respond especially strongly to social situations that trigger emotions , in this case of faces being happy or sad			2
' the brain activity was even higher when @entity76 viewed the expressions of their spouses			0
the highest activation occurred when viewing images of their partner as happy			0
most of the participants were scanned again one year later , and the same results occurred			0
areas of the brain indicating the greatest activity – as shown by blood flow – include sections known as the ' mirror neuron system , ' an area strongly associated with empathetic response and brain areas associated with awareness , processing sensory information and action planning			2
dr. @entity50 believes the results provide further evidence that @entity166 are generally highly tuned into their environment			0
he said the new findings via the @entity13 provide evidence that especially high levels of awareness and emotional responsiveness are fundamental features of humans characterized as @entity166 .			2

researchers used @entity13 scans to monitor the level of empathy
highly sensitive people tend to show heightened awareness to subtle stimuli
also process information more thoroughly
