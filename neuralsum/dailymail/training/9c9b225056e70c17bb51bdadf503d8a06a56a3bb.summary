by @entity0 @entity1 : 09:54 est , 19 december 2013 @entity2 : 14:40 est , 19 december 2013 a @entity7 woman 's @entity5 boot - camp commander forced her to scrub his office on her hands and knees and ordered another recruit to strip and have sex with him , she has revealed			1
@entity13 , from @entity14 , and three other young recruits were subject to extreme sexual harassment at a boot camp in @entity18 , @entity19 , after chief petty officer @entity20 selected them for ' house mouse ' duty in 2009 and 2010			1
she said @entity20 , who also taught training classes to quash sexual harassment , would order the women - all blonde , around 5 feet 3 inches tall and in their early 20s - to one at a time scrub his office late at night while he stood over them commenting on their bodies			1
a provision inspired by the now - 26 - year - old 's story has passed the @entity45 and it 's expected to clear the @entity46 today			1
' i think all members of @entity49 need to get on board with this and say , " we 're not going to allow this to happen to our troops , " ' @entity13 , now a police dispatcher in @entity54 , told the @entity55			1
' i 'm not sure they are all quite there yet			0
' @entity20 was sent to military prison for a year on charges of maltreating subordinates and adultery			1
@entity13 said she thought about faking a suicide attempt to get away from him while the harrassment was going on			2
' he haunts your person by day and your dreams at night , ' she said , describing the impact of the treatment			0
speaking out : @entity13 , pictured left in april , and @entity71 , right , were sexually harassed by the same company commander when they were in basic training after joining the @entity5 she and another victim , @entity71 , did not immediately report the harassment for fear of being kicked out of the @entity5 but came forward when they met a third victim			1
when their case went to trial , they met a fourth young woman who had been raped recently by the same company commander			2
@entity13 testified in the investigation that led to the court martial , however felt guilty , particularly for the woman who he forced to have sex with him , that she did n't come forward sooner			2
' i had to tell her i was sorry that i had n't reported that this had happened , ' she told the @entity55			0
' that 's why i 'm pushing so hard for this ( legislation )			2
' prosecutors could not pursue more serious sexual assault charges against the commander because military law requires proof of physical or life - threatening harm to the victim			1
angered , @entity13 took her story to the @entity100 for @entity101 @entity29 , who proposed legislation that was added to a major defense bill , the @entity55 reports			2
scene : the harassment occurred at @entity106 at @entity18 , @entity19 , where commanders are seen conducting basic training techniques the bill directs a military tribunal to redefine sexual assault in the military realm			1
@entity7 @entity114 senator @entity113 introduced the same provision in the @entity46			0
' from my point of view as the mother of a @entity121 war veteran , what struck me is that our sons and daughters put their military uniforms on to protect us			0
so we must do all we can to protect them , ' @entity29 told the newspaper			0
the bill also reportedly contains provisions to block military commanders from overturning jury convictions and to require a civilian review if a commander declines to prosecute a case			1
@entity13 believes it is a good first step but more needs to be done			2
' these people , they get a slap on the wrist and they are discharged , ' she explained			0
' and then they end up being people 's neighbors			0
they end up being in the community			0
they are not registered sex offenders , and people around them are none the wiser about what kind of history they have had			0
' until they resolve it and handle it properly , this is not going to go away			0
