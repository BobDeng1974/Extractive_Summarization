mr @entity5 caught the shark off a fixed fishing line anchored 2km from @entity10 ( pictured ) ' i target spanner crabs , snapper and other fish but i also like to put flake on the shelf for them , ' mr @entity5 said			1
' i fish , i pay my bills and i catch a few sharks … people want to eat flake and i supply it			2
' he said the angry commenters accusing him of killing near - extinct species were ' misinformed ' about fishing laws and endangered species			0

' ms @entity121 added that protected shark species in @entity4 include great hammerheads , scalloped hammerheads , great whites and grey nurses – which are listed as critically endangered			2
