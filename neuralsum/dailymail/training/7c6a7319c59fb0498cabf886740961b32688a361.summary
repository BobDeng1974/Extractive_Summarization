forget muffin tops and crows feet , women are now seeking cosmetic surgery to banish signs of ageing on their hands			1
cosmetic surgery clinics have reported an 18 per cent increase in enquiries in the past month of people having anti-ageing procedures on their hands			1
the new cosmetic surgery trend , which sees women having dermal fillers and laser resurfacing to reduce the signs of ageing , has been dubbed the banishing of ' @entity18 ' after popstar @entity18 , 55 , who has ' anti-aged ' almost every part of her body but often resorts to fingerless gloves to cover her hands			1
surgery trend : there has been a new wave in women seeking cosmetic surgery to banish their ' @entity18 ' , the treatment has been named after the singer who famously covers her hands as the years pass , skin on the hands thins , causing veins to become more prominent and liver spots to appear			1
while make - up can disguise tell - tale signs of ageing on the face , it 's more difficult with hands - which is why it 's often said that hands are the best indicator of age			1
speaking about the latest cosmetic trend , a spokesman for the transform clinic , which has seen an 18 per cent increase in the number of anti-ageing hand procedures perforemed , said : ' our hands are exposed to the sun more frequently than other parts of the body and a failure to apply sun cream to hands as regularly as we do the face makes them susceptible to sunspots and accelerated aging			1
' with the hot weather this summer we have experienced a marked increase in inquiries from women complaining of sunspots on their hands , along with the skin becoming thin and crepey			1
' @entity69 rejuvenation is becoming increasingly popular , with dermal fillers volumising and smoothing the skin , encouraging the production of collagen to provide a youthful look			0
' laser resurfacing of the hands is also on the rise thanks to its ability to improve sun - damaged skin and reduce the appearance of sunspots			2
' the @entity82 on @entity83 also offer a treatment to rejuvenate the hands and have seen a surge in enquiries			2
their procedure takes fat from one part of the patient 's body and injects it into the hands			1
it is done while the patient is awake and is designed to give long term rejuvenation benefits to the hands			2
dr @entity98 , fat transfer specialist at @entity100 , performing fat transfer to the hands on 57 year old @entity103			2
before and after : dr @entity98 , fat transfer specialist at @entity100 , performed fat transfer to the hands on 57 - year - old @entity103 @entity106 , 54 , also had similar surgery at transform because felt she was being constantly aged by her hands , which over the years have lost their youthful look so opted for the surgery			1
she said : ' @entity18 is a great example of a woman who is trying to take care of herself in her 50s just like me			2
' i can completely sympathise that her hands are the bit that gives it all away			0
' my hands were thin and veiny and just looked much older than the rest of me			0
' i 'd abused them over the years and never taken care of them and as i got older they slowly got worse			0
first sign : while make - up can disguise tell - tale signs of ageing on the face , it 's more difficult with hands - which is why it 's often said that hands are the best indicator of age ' your hands are difficult part of your body , there 's not a lot you can do with them to help and they 're always exposed			1
' i tried lots of creams , but they never worked			0
you can slather it on all you like but it does n't put back the plumpness or elasticity			0
' your hands tell the story , everywhere else was fine as i could work on that by going to the gym and taking care of myself but my hands had driven me mad for quite a while			0
' i do sympathise with @entity18 , it 's terrible when you work so hard and this one thing keeps letting you down			2
' for me it got to the point where i would wear long sleeves and be pulling the cuffs down over my wrists because i do n't like them			0
' i would often fold my wrists in as well so people could n't see my hands			0
' after doing nearly a year 's worth of research @entity106 opted for @entity169 fillers and decided to go to transform and banish her ageing hands			2
the procedure - where filler is injected into the skin - takes around 30 minutes to be completed and claims to give instant results			0
and now @entity106 believe her hands look even better than @entity18 's			1
she said : ' now i 'm much more confident , i do n't hide my hands away as much as they are better			0
' i 'd even say better than @entity18 's now			2
' dr @entity98 , joint medical director and fat transfer specialist at @entity100 of @entity83 , said : ' it is common for women , as they grow older , to lose weight in their hands , which means that veins and wrinkles can become more evident			1
prolonged exposure to the sun will also speed up the ageing process			0
' and while treatments like laser resurfacing to target the signs of ageing , or traditional fillers to make the hands appear fuller and healthier , can offer effective results , these can really only ever offer a temporary solution			0
surgery : dr @entity98 performing fat transfer to hands , which is done while the patient is awake and is designed to give long term rejuvenation benefits to the hands ' a more long terms solution is fat transfer – a technique which is fast becoming one of the most popular for hand rejuvenation purposes			1
the procedure uses advanced technology to produce a pure and effective fat graft , which means that fat can safely be taken from one area of the patient ’s body , such as their thighs or stomach , and injected into the hands			1
' the fact that the procedure is minimally invasive is also an important factor			0
many patients have careers which do not allow for them to be away from work for long periods of time			0
fat transfer is a walk - in , walk - out procedure and one which is performed under local anaesthetic , so patients can undergo treatment without too much disruption to their lives			1
' over time i expect to see procedures such as this continue to grow in popularity , as women decide to invest further in different aspects of their appearance , later into life			0
