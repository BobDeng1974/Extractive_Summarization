@entity0 has hit back at a woman who claims he got her drunk and sexually assaulted her when she was 15 at the @entity3			1
the under - fire comic , now 77 , is accused of attacking 19 women , and has so far remained silent amid the myriad of claims			1
however , today , he has chosen to file court papers against @entity9 - who is suing him for alleged sexual assault in 1974 - an incident which may well be investigated by @entity14 cops			1
@entity0 calls her claims ' absolutely false ' and in papers seen by @entity19 , the star claims miss @entity21 's lawyer tried to extort him for $ 100,000 - and then raised the price to $ 250,000 as new women came forward to make similar claims			1
lawsuit : @entity0 is accusing @entity9 , who says he attacked her when she was 15 , of extortion			1
she has launched a lawsuit against him for sexual assault demands : attorney @entity30 is flanked by @entity0 accusers at her office on wednesday , from left , @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 weeping : @entity34 , now a grandmother , breaks down on wednesday afternoon as she claims that @entity0 drugged and assaulted her when she was 17 in the court papers , @entity0 says miss @entity9 's lawyer approached his attorney @entity39 last month and made ' ominous references to criminal penalties			1
' the lawyer , @entity0 claims , demanded cash in return for silence - upping the demands as more women came forward			1
@entity0 alleges that @entity48 tried to sell the story to the media 10 years ago , but no - one would publish her claims			1
the court papers state : ' approximately 10 years ago , plaintiff @entity53 unsuccessfully tried to get money from a tabloid by selling the same story about @entity0 that is the subject of this lawsuit			1
' knowing that since she disclosed her allegations to a media outlet 10 years ago , she can not claim to have a repressed memory			0
' the argument of a repressed memory would allow miss @entity9 to file a civil lawsuit within three years of the time she remembered			1
however , if she recalled the incident a decade ago , her lawsuit is moot , @entity0 's papers state			1
miss @entity9 filed her own suit on tuesday , alleging she has suffered ' psychological injuries and illnesses ' that she only connected to the assault within the last three years			1
the lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for sexual battery and emotional distress			0
she claims she first met @entity0 as a teenager with her 16 - year - old friend as they wandered on to the set of his movie			1
he invited them to his @entity83 tennis club the following saturday , where they then followed him to a house where he ' served them alcohol beverages and played games of billiards ' with @entity48 , according to the lawsuit			0
miss @entity9 was required to drink a beer every time @entity0 won a game , the lawsuit said			1
later , the girls followed @entity0 to the @entity3 , where the comedian told @entity9 and her friend to say they were 19 if anyone asked their ages , according to the papers			1
at one point , miss @entity9 emerged from a bathroom to find @entity0 sitting on a bed			1
the lawsuit states he asked her to sit down next to him and attempted to ' put his hand down her pants '			0
he then took her hand in his and performed a sexual act on himself ' without her consent ' , the lawsuit said			0
' this traumatic incident , at such a tender age , has caused psychological damage and mental anguish ... that has caused her significant problems through her life , ' the lawsuit said			0
however , @entity0 claims that @entity48 lied about playing a ' drinking game ' with him where the pair drank three beers , as his lawyer says it well known that @entity0 is a ' lifelong non-drinker '			1
@entity0 's papers state : ' the drinking age in @entity121 at the time was 21			1
' the papers state that @entity48 's lawyer did not even know if she was seeing a therapist , accusing her and her lawyer of ' engaging in a shakedown ' @entity0 is now demanding that the lawsuit is dismissed and has requested ' monetary sanctions of not less than $ 33,295			1
' attorney @entity30 yesterday challenged @entity0 to pay $ 100 million in damages to the women who claim he sexually assaulted them			1
the lawyer introduced three alleged victims - two who have never spoken before - and as they broke down in tears , she told @entity0 he could waive the statute of limitations so all the women accusing him of assault could have their day in court			1
if not , she said , he could stump up $ 100 million - and the money would be handed out to the women by a committee of retired judges			2
speaking at her @entity121 law offices , miss @entity30 said she had been forced to tell many women who had contacted her to report abuse at the hands of the comic legend that they were too late to file a lawsuit due to the statute of limitations			2
however , she said : ' today , i am here to propose two new solutions to this public dilemma and a away to determine if @entity0 is a saint of a sexual predator			1
' she said that if @entity0 is ' confident ' he has done nothing wrong , he could waive the statute of limitations , adding : ' then his alleged victims would have an opportunity to have their allegations dealt with on their merits			2
the woman who started it all : @entity167 , a former basketball player , sued @entity0 in 2005 and settled later on			2
@entity35 was @entity168 5 in @entity167 's civil court case emotional : former supermodel @entity171 says @entity0 drugged and raped her in 1982 alleged victims : @entity173 ( left ) and @entity174 ( right ) join the ranks of woman who claim @entity0 assaulted them ' @entity0 would have an opportunity to address there allegations in a court of law and the victims and mr @entity0 would have an opportunity to have a judge and jury decide who should be believed			1
' this would be similar , miss @entity30 said , to the @entity190 cases in @entity121 , which involved allegations of sexual abuse by priests			2
a law allowed victims to sue within a one year period			0
alternatively , miss @entity30 said , if @entity0 did not want to waive the statute of limitations , he could pour $ 100 million into a fund , adding that anyone who claims to be a victim could put their case in front of a panel of retired judges , who would act as arbitrators , who would then decided if their case had merit - and how much damages they would be awarded			1
@entity0 has an estimated fortune of $ 400 million , according to celebrity @entity216			2
he has made his fortune through numerous endorsements including @entity220 , @entity221 and @entity222 - and dominating tv in the 1980s with @entity224			0

however , miss @entity30 said : ' it 's time for justice and accountability and we challenge him to end this nightmare , both for him and the alleged victims by accepting either of the options that i proposed and we look forward to his response			2
' @entity34 , from @entity121 - now believed to be a 46 - year - old grandmother - told how @entity0 attacked her when she was just 17 in 1986 when she was an aspiring model			2
weeping , she said her stepmother had sent pictures of her to the star and he called her at home in @entity255 , inviting her to the @entity256 @entity255 , where he was performing and she had a job			0
she then went up to @entity259 suite to meet him and after telling him she had a cold , he gave her a blue pill , which he said was an antihistimine , with a double shot of @entity263			0
she said : ' he was rubbing my neck and saying that he might have to have someone come in and give me stress therapy			0

' i could not open my eyes			0
i could n't move or say anything			0
i felt something warm on my legs			0
' ' thirteen to sixteen hours later i woke up by hearing mr @entity0 clapping his hands and saying ' @entity295 says wake up '			1
