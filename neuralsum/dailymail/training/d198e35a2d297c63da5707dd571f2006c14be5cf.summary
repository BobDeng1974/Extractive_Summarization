many people might associate roses with romance novels , but in fact the smell of chocolate tempts readers to buy loved - up fiction			0
researchers at @entity9 in @entity10 found that while a chocolatey smell makes people hungry to buy romance novels , it does not necessarily tempt people to buy grittier genres such as crime or business books			1
the scientists , who permeated a bookshop with the perfume of chocolate , also found that the scent encouraged customers to browse through titles			2
the government funded study found that bookshop visitors were almost six times more likely to buy a romance novel if they smelt chocolate - and the same results applied to cookery books too they studied the behaviour of 201 customers in a popular chain bookshop over ten days to find that customers were 3.5 times more likely to pick up romance novels when they smelt chocolate , @entity32 reported			1
the government funded study also found that bookshop visitors were almost six times more likely to buy a romance novel - and the same results applied to cookery books too			1
@entity10 scientists found the smell of chocolate makes people buy romance books written by novelists such as @entity45 ( pictured ) @entity46 , who led the study told the newspaper : ' when consumers smell chocolate , concepts associated with chocolate , such as cooking , become more readily accessible to the consumer 's mind and cause consumers to react differently when encountering a cookbook than if they had not smelled chocolate			1
' the researchers concluded romance , food and drink books were strongly linked with the smell of chocolate , but other categories of literature were not , such as comic and graphic novels , travel , art , gardening , crime , law and business books			2
however , perhaps sue to the scent encouraging customers to browse and deviate from their usual purchasing habits , sales of the ' incongruent ' books also increased , with customers 1.2 times more likely to buy any of the books on offer in the chain bookshop			2
previous research has found that the smell of chocolate has a positive effect on a person 's mood , sparking feelings of pleasure or even arousal when shopping for goods			0
the @entity10 study said : ' the presence of a chocolate scent has a positive influence on general approach behaviour and a negative impact on goal - directed behaviour in the store			0
' retail experts already exploit customers ' sense of smell to influence their attention span and buying behaviour			0
the new research has taken it a step further by marrying a specific scent with products - even if the books themselves do not have a distinctive smell .			0

@entity10 scientists *flooded* a bookshop with a chocolatey smell to find customers were almost six times more likely to buy a romance novel
the government - funded study said the scent does not have a *big* effect on making people want to purchase travel , crime , business or comic books
researchers at @entity9 said the *sweet* smell encouraged customers to browse and sales of all books rose during the *experiment*
