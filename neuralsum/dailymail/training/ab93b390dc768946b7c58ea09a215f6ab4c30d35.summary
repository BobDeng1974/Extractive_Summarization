by @entity0 furious : @entity2 , @entity3 's spin doctor , was said to be incensed by attacks on her lover @entity5 the feud between two senior @entity8 colleagues may centre on toxic allegations about ministerial failure to address the threat of terrorism and an alleged refusal to heed warnings of a plot by extremist @entity16 to take over several schools in @entity18			1
but behind it lies a fascinating tale of two @entity22 civil servants who are having an affair together			2
one of those involved is a no - nonsense @entity26 divorcee , @entity2 , 40 , who is home secretary @entity3 ’s devoted spin doctor			1
for two years , she has been in a close relationship with her colleague @entity5 , 54 , a former spy chief who runs the @entity30 in the @entity22			2
when they were both criticised by officials in @entity34 ’s @entity33 , miss @entity2 went into full - blooded attack mode			2
i ’m told she immediately mounted an operation that would have been worthy of the attack dogs once employed by @entity39 , who conducted smear campaigns against not only opposition @entity41 , but against people on their own side , too			0
miss @entity2 is a former journalist with @entity45 who is now one of the most powerful figures in the @entity22 , advising on everything from policy to mrs may ’s clothes and trademark designer shoes			2
under fire from mr @entity34 ’s officials , who had accused the home secretary of being reluctant to confront the threat of terrorists strongly enough , miss @entity2 was particularly furious that , by implication , the reputation of her lover ( who , as a civil servant , is unable to answer his critics in public ) was being maligned			1
mischievously , @entity63 political editor , @entity62 , suggested on @entity64 ’s today programme yesterday that the relationship between the ex-spy chief and the adviser was a ‘ complicating factor ’ in the war of words between the two ministers			2
his report caused outrage in the @entity22 , which is convinced he was put up to it by mr @entity34 ’s officials , a charge both @entity62 and @entity34 ’s camp deny			1
whatever the truth , the relationship between miss @entity2 ( whose marriage to a journalist ended in divorce six years ago ) and mr @entity5 has caused a stir in @entity84			1
‘ if the person who is giving the advice is in love with the individual who is meant to be considering the merits of the advice , it is understandable that it is a cause for some alarm , ’ says one official			0
indeed , mr @entity5 , who worked for @entity95 in the @entity96 , is not popular among colleagues			1
he has even upset the mild - mannered @entity98 , director of the pressure group @entity99			0
having described herself once as ‘ an irritant to six democratically elected secretaries of state ’ , she said she was ‘ generally treated with courtesy and even kindness in their [ the ministers ] company			2
’ but she added : ‘ by contrast , mr @entity5 is the only person ever to shout at me in the @entity22			1
’ mr @entity5 wears thinly rimmed spectacles that give him an owlish appearance and once led the @entity113 mp @entity112 , chairman of the home affairs committee , to describe him as ‘ a grown - up @entity115 ’			1
educated at @entity117 , a private boys ’ school in @entity120 , and @entity121 , @entity122 , mr @entity5 did a phd in the philosophy of aesthetics — not maths or modern languages , the normal subjects for a spy			1
after university , he joined @entity95 , working in southern @entity131 and the @entity132			0
he was once assigned to fly round @entity133 in a helicopter , with thousands of dollars in cash , trying to persuade farmers not to grow opium			0
he has never married and , typical of his character , his relationship with miss @entity2 has been conducted discreetly			2
they do n’t live together and are rarely seen in public together			0
the other pair in this poisonous feud - mrs may and mr @entity34 - have history , too			1
the slow - burning fuse that finally resulted in yesterday ’s explosion was lit when they first became @entity149 in 2010			2
silent : @entity151 , pictured , has conducted his relationship discretely			0
as a civil servant , he is unable to answer criticisms in public she was a surprise choice to be home secretary , having never held the brief in @entity159			0
for his part , mr @entity34 has a long record of calling for an uncompromising hard line on @entity164 terrorism			1
in his book , @entity169 , published in 2006 , the year after the terrorist bombs in @entity166 , the former @entity168 journalist accused the @entity170 of spawning extremist terror through a policy of appeasing fundamentalism			0
crucially , he believes the @entity22 is guilty of this charge			2
indeed , the two ministers clashed at a recent meeting of the @entity177 , which was set up after the murder of drummer @entity179 by @entity164 extremists in @entity181 last year			0
mr @entity34 considered the @entity22 had not acted firmly enough against hardline @entity164 preachers			1
however , his position was opposed by mrs may – backed by loyal aide mr @entity5 – who believes in a more softly - softly approach			1
as a result , mr @entity34 was out - manoeuvred by mrs may , who is well - known for fiercely resisting any attempts by fellow ministers to ‘ encroach ’ on her policy area			1
not to be outdone , mr @entity34 contacted the prime minister , who is a close friend , to put his case			1
mrs may duly found out much later - and has been spoiling for revenge ever since			0
but it ’s not just differences over the response to @entity164 terrorism that have mr @entity34 and mrs may at daggers drawn			1
although @entity202 regards her as a competent minister who can master a complex brief , he sees her as incapable of innovative and independent thought			0
this , he believes , rules her out as party leader			0
as for mrs may , she regards mr @entity34 as an intellectual snob who spends too much time scheming and plotting			2
she is angry , too , that he does not accord her the respect she thinks her more elevated @entity8 position deserves			0
nothing stops her , though , ‘ encroaching ’ on his turf			0
last spring , she made a speech that ranged beyond her @entity22 brief , suggesting that people who run mr @entity34 ’s much - loved ‘ free ’ schools should be allowed to make profits for themselves			1
the speech was seen as a signal of her leadership ambitions			0
feud : mr @entity34 , left , was given a dressing - down by the prime minister for triggering the row with mrs may , right mr @entity34 was incensed , and during a @entity8 session a few days later , he angrily declared his ‘ shock at seeing some around the table participating in leadership speculation ’			1
everyone in the room , including @entity233 knew he was referring to may			0
despite the provocation , a furious mrs may remained at the table stony - faced			0
however , she was even more enraged when a word - perfect account of the exchange was leaked to the @entity237			0
to add to the explosive mix , it was revealed this week that mrs may has , for the first time , topped a ‘ league table ’ of cabinet ministers after @entity242 activists were asked to give an approval rating - edging @entity243 and mr @entity34 into second and third place			1
she is also ahead of @entity248 , in the same poll , over who should eventually succeed mr @entity233			0
she scored 35 per cent , mr @entity248 23 per cent and mr @entity34 7.9 per cent , down from 15 per cent three months ago			2
the drop in the popularity of mr @entity34 , who professes no leadership ambitions and backs mr @entity243 to succeed the prime minister , could be because he is perceived as being involved in too many unnecessary controversies			1
this feeling will undoubtedly increase after the @entity257 was overshadowed by the row between him and mrs may			0
significantly , it was mr @entity34 whom no 10 officials ordered to issue a conciliatory statement yesterday			1
as for his bitter rival , mrs may may not be an intellectual titan - but we ’re quickly learning that she is a formidable political bruiser whom colleagues cross at their peril .			0
