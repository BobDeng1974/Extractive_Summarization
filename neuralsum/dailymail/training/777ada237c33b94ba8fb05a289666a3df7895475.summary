by @entity0 this is the moment an incredibly cute baby gorilla appeared to collapse in a fit of giggles when an adult started ticking his tummy			1
five - month - old @entity8 was being showered with affection by the other gorillas in his enclosure at @entity12 in eastern @entity13 when one of them reached out and gently prodded him on the ribs			1
displaying an almost human response to the sensation , @entity8 's eyes lit up with joy and his mouth broke into a huge grin as the adult gorilla played with him			1
@entity24 : displaying an almost human response , five - month - old @entity8 's eyes light up with joy and his mouth breaks into a huge grin as an adult gorilla gently prods him on the ribs fun : the arrival of @entity8 's sister @entity32 ( right ) was the cause of much celebration at @entity12 , as it is rare for two babies to be born to the same family group within four months despite his tiny frame , @entity8 is not the youngest gorilla in the enclosure after he was joined by a sister named @entity32 in early march			1
the arrival was the cause of much celebration at @entity12 , as it is rare for two babies to be born to the same family group within four months of each other			0
the oldest member of @entity8 's family to live at the zoo is his grandmother @entity46 who , somewhat surprisingly , is one of the baby gorilla 's favourite playmates			2

family : @entity8 ( left ) relaxes alongside his little sister @entity32 ( right ) and their adoring mother @entity60 like father like son : tiny baby @entity64 sits in front of his much larger father @entity66 at @entity12 zoo like the other great apes , gorillas share many traits with humans			2
they can laugh , grieve , develop strong family bonds , make and use tools , and even think about the past and make plans for the future			0
much like humans , @entity8 will be considered a child until he reaches puberty around the age of 13			0
although a gorilla 's lifespan is around 35 years in the wild , those kept in captivity live into their 50s thanks to a healthier diet , less exposure to disease , and medical treatment constantly at hand .			0
