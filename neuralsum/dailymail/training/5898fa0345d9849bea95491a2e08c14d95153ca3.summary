by @entity0 published : 07:49 est , 4 march 2013 updated : 14:39 est , 4 march 2013 @entity1 will veto @entity3 and @entity4 's bid to join the @entity6 passport - free zone if the @entity8 countries push for membership this week			1
interior minister @entity10 warned both nations that if they insist on entry into the scheme ' @entity1 will veto it and they will fail			1
' the countries are expected to apply to join the group in a meeting on thursday , but their bid has been undermined by fears non-europeans could bribe their way in to the countries and then travel elsewhere in the @entity24 with ease			1
it is strong language from a politician well versed in more diplomatic speak , but @entity1 is undergoing an invasion of immigrants from both countries with many cities experiencing extreme social tensions as a result			2
problems : the mayor of @entity38 , @entity1 , claims @entity4 and @entity3 migrants are creating havoc in the city only last friday the left - wing mayor of the former industrial city of @entity38 spoke of rubbish mountains , children of immigrants organised into gangs for stealing expeditions and an apartment block for 200 housing nearly 400 @entity3 and @entity4			1
the @entity6 accord allows participating nations to allow its citizens to pass borders without having to show a passport			2
26 nations participate , though @entity57 has always opted out of it due to security concerns			0
if @entity3 and @entity4 did join @entity6 , their citizens would still need a passport to enter @entity57 , but immigrants would be able to pass through @entity8 to countries such as @entity65 or the @entity66 , making it much easier to smuggle themselves into the @entity57			1
when asked if either @entity3 or @entity4 could have a @entity6 entry at a major air or seaport , mr @entity10 said ' no , ' adding : ' the concept of freeing up certain areas , such as arrivals by air or via seaports , is likewise unacceptable			1
' the @entity24 has long been evaluating whether or not @entity3 and @entity4 are ready for acceptance in the @entity78			1
the last annual report showed progress , but it 's not enough			0
' @entity4 and @entity3 still have to be more decisive in the fight against corruption			1
those who acquire a visa through bribery could travel all the way to @entity1 without further controls			2
' our citizens will only accept an expansion of the @entity78 if some fundamental conditions have been met			0
that is not yet the case			0
' ' @entity94 ' : @entity95 described mountains of waster ' taller than i am ' outside buildings housing the city 's @entity101 community the minister also called for stricter sanctions for anyone who tried to cheat a country 's social security system			0
@entity57 particularly fears this scenario when its labour market is opened to @entity3 and @entity4 in january next year			2
the @entity66 is also staunchly opposed to @entity3 and @entity4 joining the @entity6 club			1
with expectations of admission low , @entity3 prime minister @entity111 now says his country 's membership of @entity6 was ' no longer a priority ' , even though it is on the agenda for the thursday meeting			1
but he added : ' the government has done everything it could so that the decision is positive and i still have hopes for that			0
' mr @entity10 , in a parting shot aimed at @entity127 mandarins who take decisions without consulting the people of the @entity24 , added : ' @entity131 has to learn to pay closer attention to the viewpoints and sensitivities of the people in @entity24 member states			2
' the basic attitude of " oh , we 'll just turn a blind eye , the main thing is that the @entity24 continues to grow , " is no longer acceptable for those who have to answer to the citizenry			0
' ' social unrest ' : interior minister @entity10 , left , has warned against the influx of immigrants coming from @entity8 as @entity38 , right , continues to struggle with its @entity101 community @entity95 , the left - wing mayor of @entity38 , close to the border with @entity148 , claims prostitution and robberies have spiked since the @entity24 's latest members began arriving last year			1
' we are massively affected , ' said the mayor , confirming the fears of the @entity155 which recently warned of ' social unrest ' because of the economic refugees			0
he spoke of rubbish mountains ' taller than i am ' outside of dilapidated housing blocks in the district where , in one , 400 @entity4 and @entity3 are crammed into just over 40 apartments			2
' children are misused there and sent on stealing missions , ' he claimed in a tv discussion about the problem			0
@entity1 is the continent 's most socially - minded nation with a lavish array of welfare benefits			2
some @entity101 families are claiming over Â£ 2,000 a month in child welfare payments , even though they are technically not supposed to work in the country until january next year			0
' @entity174 affected ' : @entity38 's mayor claims @entity3 and @entity4 migrants are costing the city millions per year ' it is costing us millions and will cost us more by next year , ' added mr link , who said anyone who thought the problem was going to go away was ' misty eyed '			1
he added : ' we did n't ask for this problem and we ca n't handle it alone			0
' on his @entity187 page the mayor wrote : ' @entity189 slogans and strong words do not help ! ' his outspokenness earned him the praise of citizens including pensioner @entity194 , 67 , who said : ' if my rubbish spills out on the street i would be slapped with a summons in no time			0
why do they get away with it ? ' housewife @entity201 , 57 , added : ' i have sympathy for the poor people , but we are also afraid of them			0
