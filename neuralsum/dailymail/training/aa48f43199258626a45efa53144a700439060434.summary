by @entity0 published : 11:02 est , 1 november 2012 updated : 13:25 est , 1 november 2012 first it was the @entity2 , now it is the the @entity3 as a vicar and members of his congregation show a little bit more than normal – but it is all for a good cause			1
the reverend @entity9 and a number of his regular church goers defrocked for a calendar to raise much needed funds for their place of worship			1
inspired by the famous @entity19 calendar , @entity16 and his 17 helpers hope their arty black and white pictures will provide money for @entity22 in @entity23 , @entity24			1
striking the right note : the @entity26 poses with his guitar in a field as he raises money for @entity22 in @entity23 , @entity24 doing their bit : a member of the @entity34 congregation strips off and washes a car for the calendar lord of the manor : @entity38 poses next to his tractor on @entity41 farm for the calendar calendar boy : the @entity26 came up with the idea to shoot a calendar a wide range of members of the community volunteered their services , including a farmer , a dancer , two firemen and a retired policeman all baring everything for the cause			1
@entity16 said : ‘ i keep bumping into people and they either have a copy or they want to know where to buy one			0
' most people think it ’s hilarious , which is what it was always intended to be			0
' profits from the calendar will help pay for replacement bells and repairs to the church tower			1
@entity69 , who had the idea for the calendar , said a generous donation meant that printing costs had been covered			1
and thanks to @entity74 in @entity75 which donated its services for free , all profits are going straight to the fund			1
mr @entity69 said : ' sales are going really well			0
we ’re hoping we can cover the cost of at least one of the new bells			1
' most of the pictures were taken over several months earlier this year on @entity38 ( mr august ) ’s @entity41 farm			2
hat 's your lot : two men cover themselves with their hat hand on the ball : two men from the community strip off and play football fixing the tractor : the profits from the calendar will go towards @entity22 as well as shots in wheat fields and climbing into tractors @entity38 said a sandy beach had been created from a pile of grain and a patch of grass outside the office had doubled as a football pitch			1
he said : ' it was really hard finding a big enough patch of grass			0
we had to move the tractors across the gates so people would n’t see			0
' emergency services : a member of the congregation poses with a policeman 's helmet @entity120 choppers : a couple of younger men in the community show off their skills boat ride : a member of the congregation strips off on the water @entity38 said the whole thing had been much more complicated than everyone had realised but he praised the work put in by photographer @entity132			2
he said : ' when i asked @entity132 to give us a hand he was only meant to be supervising equipment			0
where are my clothes ? a naked cyclist looks at a map for april 's picture the naked painter : mr october paints a wall without any clothes on a colourful end to the year : december 's picture of a beach is the only one shot in colour ' but when he turned up he just had a better idea of what would look good			2
we said ‘ you ’re better			0
can you take them ? ’ and then he ended up doing all the editing too			0
' @entity158 , chair of the @entity159 , said she was delighted how the calendar had turned out			2
she said : ‘ i think they ’ve been incredibly brave			0
i ’m just very , very proud of them all			0
