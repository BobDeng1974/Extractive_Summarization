a healthy adult should be consuming something in the region of 2,000 calories a day , according to the @entity4			1
but a new photo series by the @entity6 has revealed just what 2,000 calories looks like at some of the @entity11 's favourite fast food chains - and it 's often a lot smaller than you might think			1
at @entity15 you can fill half of you daily quota just by ordering a double whopper with cheese , while adding a side of onion rings and a vanilla milkshake takes you to 2,030 calories			1
onion rings ( 410 calories ) and a vanilla milkshake ( 550 calories ) bring the total to 2,030 @entity34 : to consume 2,000 calories , one would need to order a @entity37 @entity36 ( 460 calories ) , latte ( 190 calories ) , orange mango smoothie ( 270 calories ) , cheese toastie ( 580 calories ) , popcorn ( 125 calories ) and a sausage croissant ( 410 calories ) @entity48 's : you 'd need to order a @entity51 sandwich with bacon ( 750 calories ) , fries ( 340 calories ) , @entity56 ( 200 calories ) and a mcflurry with @entity59 ( 690 calories ) to hit that 2,000 mark at @entity48 's a modest - sized lunch of a @entity50 with bacon ( 750 calories ) , fries ( 340 calories ) , @entity56 ( 200 calories ) and a mcflurry with @entity59 ( 690 calories ) will see you over the 2,000 - a - day limit			1
the same applies to @entity69 , where a @entity71 pizza is 880 calories			0
add a soft drink at 440 calories , baked chicken wings with dip ( 340 calories ) , and two cookies ( 360 calories ) and you 've met your daily quota			2
@entity81 may not have been on @entity11 shores for long , but it is also deceptively easy to hit your daily quota here , largely thanks to the carnitas burrito which has 945 calories all by itself			2
add in some nacho chips and guacamole ( 770 calories ) and a @entity56 ( 276 calories ) and you 're there			0
another new addition to the @entity11 food scene , @entity95 , has a similar problem , with the signature @entity97 providing 770 calories			0
adding in fries ( 470 calories ) and a @entity101 milkshake ( 760 calories ) is enough to top the limit			1
subway : a ham and turkey sub ( 375 calories ) , chips ( 230 calories ) , chicken noodle soup with croutons ( 155 calories ) , cookie ( 220 calories ) , @entity116 - chicken salad ( 360 calories ) , @entity56 ( 200 calories ) , egg - and - cheese flatbread ( 370 calories ) and juice ( 100 calories ) equates to 2,000 calories @entity69 : a meat lover ’s @entity125 pizza is 880 calories			1
add a soft drink at 440 calories , baked chicken wings with cheese dip ( 340 calories ) , and two cookies ( 360 calories ) and you 've met your daily quota at @entity81 you could hit 2,000 calories by ordering a carnitas burrito ( 945 calories , left ) , nacho chips and guacamole ( 770 calories ) and a @entity56 ( 276 calories )			1
at @entity95 , the same could be achieved with a @entity145 ( 770 calories ) , fries ( 470 calories ) and a @entity101 milkshake ( 760 calories ) it is slightly trickier to over-do it at @entity34 , but combining a @entity37 @entity36 ( 460 calories ) , latte ( 190 calories ) , orange mango smoothie ( 270 calories ) , cheese toastie ( 580 calories ) , popcorn ( 125 calories ) and a sausage croissant ( 410 calories ) will get you there			2
as many sandwiches and salads at @entity104 clock in at under 400 calories , it is the additional items you need to watch out for			0
here , 2,000 calories consists of a ham and turkey sub ( 375 calories ) , crisps ( 230 calories ) , chicken noodle soup with croutons ( 155 calories ) , a cookie ( 220 calories ) , @entity116 - chicken salad ( 360 calories ) , @entity56 ( 200 calories ) , an egg - and - cheese flatbread ( 370 calories ) and juice ( 100 calories )			1
some of the dishes listed above are only available in the @entity182 , but most have their @entity11 equivalents			2
and here 's what 2,000 calories looks like in @entity182 ... while over-indulging at @entity11 food chains may give you your daily calories in one meal , in @entity182 it is easily possible to hit 2,000 calories by eating just one dish			1
at the @entity195 , for instance , the @entity193 clocks in at 2,370 calories - no drinks or sides required			2
at @entity200 , all one needs is a @entity201 to consume 2,090 calories in one swift sitting , while a slice of @entity206 cake at @entity207 is 1,790 calories all by itself ( a cappuccino on the side would be an additional 220 calories )			0
cheesecake factory : the @entity193 clocks in at 2,370 calories without sides or a drink @entity200 : the chain 's @entity201 contains a whopping 2,090 calories @entity217 : a @entity221 , with sausage contains 1,880 calories ( the pancakes are included and served alongside the main dish )			0
a glass of orange juice contains 110 calories @entity226 's : a 2,000 calorie feast might include orange beef ( 565 calories ) , pad thai ( 580 calories ) , spinach ( 120 calories ) , dumplings ( 195 calories ) , caramel cake ( 430 calories ) and wine ( 125 calories ) and while @entity217 's @entity221 with sausage might appear to feed two ( or even three ) , it is actually intended as a 1,880 - calorie dish for one			1
a glass of orange juice at 110 calories brings it closer to a 2,000 total			0
one would really need to order a lot at @entity104 to hit 2,000 @entity250 - thousand calories also equates to a hearty feast at @entity226 's , including orange beef ( 565 calories ) , pad thai ( 580 calories ) , spinach ( 120 calories ) , dumplings ( 195 calories ) , caramel cake ( 430 calories ) and wine ( 125 calories )			2
at @entity263 , it does n't take much effort to consume 2,000 calories			1
in fact , just a standard meal of a salad ( 150 calories ) , breadstick ( 140 calories ) , @entity271 sampler ( 1,500 calories ) and a quartino of wine ( 230 calories ) will do it			0
at @entity278 , you could achieve the same result simply by ordering the cowboy ribeye steak ( 1,690 calories ) and a martini ( 230 calories )			0
@entity263 : a salad ( 150 calories ) , breadstick ( 140 calories ) , @entity271 sampler ( 1,500 calories ) and a quartino of wine ( 230 calories ) contains a total of 2,020 calories @entity293 's @entity292 : do n't order a main , do n't even order a starter			0
this slice of @entity206 cake is 1,790 calories all by itself			0
a cappuccino on the side would be an additional 220 calories @entity304 's @entity303 : meet your daily calorie intake simply by ordering the cowboy ribeye steak ( 1,690 calories ) and a martini ( 230 calories )			0
