nestled in the heart of a dwarf galaxy 54 million light years from @entity1 is a black hole so big it makes up 15 % of the star cluster ’s total mass. the supermassive black hole , discovered at the centre of galaxy @entity8 , is said to have a mass equivalent to 21 million suns			1
by comparison , the galaxy is 500 times smaller than the @entity13 , which itself has a black hole at its heart with a mass of just four million suns			1
an artist 's impression of the supermassive black hole , discovered at the centre of galaxy @entity8			1
it is said to have a mass equivalent to 21 million suns			1
the finding suggests that huge black holes may be more common than previously thought , and other ultracompact dwarf galaxies are likely to also contain similar supermassive black holes			1
a black hole is a region where matter has become so densely squeezed that not even light can escape its gravitational pull			2
scientists believe @entity8 may be the remnant of a larger galaxy that had its outer regions torn away after approaching too close to the monster - sized @entity38 galaxy , which it now orbits			2
a similar story could be behind the formation of other dwarf galaxies , which may also harbour super-massive black holes			2
astronomers used the @entity46 eight - metre telescope on @entity47 , @entity48 , to investigate @entity8			0
the dwarf galaxy orbits @entity38 , a colossal galaxy containing a 4.5 billion solar mass black hole			1
@entity38 - @entity8 is about 54 million light years from @entity1 , but just 22,000 light years from the centre of @entity38			1
the astronomers estimated the mass of the dwarf galaxy 's supermassive black hole by measuring the speed and motion of stars in orbit around it			1
they found that the galaxy contains more mass than would be expected by the amount of starlight it emits			0
the stars at the centre of @entity8 move at about 230,000 mph - faster than stars would be expected to move without the black hole			2
an alternate theory is that @entity8 does n't have a supermassive black hole , but instead is populated by a lot of massive , dim stars			1
but dr @entity76 said the research team 's observations with the @entity46 telescope , and analysis of archival photos by the @entity82 , revealed that mass was concentrated in the galaxy 's centre , indicating the presence of the supermassive black hole			1
' we do n’t know of any other way you could make a black hole so big in an object this small , ' said lead scientist dr @entity76 , from the @entity94			2
' there are a lot of similar ultra-compact dwarf galaxies , and together they may contain as many super-massive black holes as there are at the centres of normal galaxies			0

@entity38 - @entity8 is about 54 million light years from @entity1 , but just 22,000 light years from the centre of @entity38			1
ultra-compact dwarf galaxies are less than a few hundred light years across compared with the @entity13 ’s 100,000 light years			0
' [ the finding ] is pretty amazing , given that the @entity13 is 500 times larger and more than 1,000 times heavier than the dwarf galaxy @entity8 , ' dr @entity76 said			2
' we believe this once was a very big galaxy with maybe 10 billion stars in it , but then it passed very close to the center of an even larger galaxy , @entity38 , and in that process all the stars and dark matter in the outer part of the galaxy got torn away and became part of @entity38			0
' dr @entity76 added , however , that the dwarf galaxy @entity8 may be doomed , although he can not say when because its orbit around @entity38 is n't known			2
@entity38 is among the largest galaxies in what astronomers refer to as ' the local universe			0
' ' eventually , [ @entity8 ] may merge with the centre of @entity38 , which has a monster black hole in it , with 4.5 billion solar masses - more than 1,000 times bigger than the supermassive black hole in our galaxy			1
' when that happens , the black hole we found in @entity8 will merge with that monster black hole			2

scientists believe @entity8 may be the remnant of a larger galaxy that had its outer regions torn away after approaching too close to another monster - sized galaxy , which it now orbits the study – conducted by dr @entity76 and 13 other astronomers – was funded by the @entity154 in the @entity155 , the @entity156 and the @entity46 partnership , which includes the @entity154 and scientific agencies in @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 and @entity163			0
the @entity46 is an astronomical observatory made up of two 8.19 - metre telescopes at sites in @entity48 and @entity160			0
together , the twin telescopes provide almost complete coverage of both the northern and southern skies			0
one telescope , called @entity46 , is located on @entity48 's @entity47 volcano			0
this location was picked because it has a stable , dry , and rarely cloudy atmosphere above the 4,200 - metre - high dormant volcano			0
the other telescope , @entity46 , is located at around 2,700 metres high on a mountain in the @entity177 called @entity178			0
there are only two small regions neither telescope can capture near the celestial poles : @entity46 can not point north of declination +89 degrees which @entity46 ca n't point south of -89 degrees			0
ultracompact dwarf galaxies are among the densest star systems in the universe			0
@entity38 - @entity8 is the most massive of these systems now known , with a total of 140 million solar masses			1
astronomers have debated whether these dwarf galaxies are the stripped centers or nuclei of larger galaxies that were ripped away during collisions with other galaxies , or whether they formed like globular clusters - groups of perhaps 100,000 stars , all born together			0
there are about 200 globular clusters in our @entity13 , and some galaxies have thousands , dr @entity76 continued			0

the astronomers studied @entity8 because they had published a paper last year showing the galaxy was an x-ray source and was extremely dense			0
the x-ray emissions suggest gas is being sucked into the black hole at a rate typical of supermassive black holes in much larger galaxies			1
the new research is published in the journal @entity257 .			0

@entity38 - @entity8 is smallest galaxy known to contain a supermassive black hole
it is said to have a mass equivalent to 21 million suns
by comparison , @entity13 's black hole has a mass of four million suns
@entity38 - @entity271 ’s black hole accounts for 15 % of the small galaxy ’s total mass
finding suggests huge black holes may be more common than first thought
