the frontline @entity1 squadron spearheading @entity3 ’s air strikes on jihadist fighters in @entity5 was saved from government defence cuts last night – for at least a year			1
in a surprise visit to @entity9 , @entity7 announced that 102 - year old @entity10 , which had been due to be disbanded in april , would be reprieved			1
two more @entity12 fighter bombers were also being sent to @entity9 as the @entity3 intensified operations against @entity15 targets in @entity5			1
with six @entity17 flying daily sorties focused on is fighters and their military hardware , the prime minister told air crews and troops at the giant @entity1 base at @entity24 in @entity9 : ‘ we want to make sure that we can keep up this tempo in the days ahead			1
its parliament voted 298 - 98 in favour of the motion which sets the legal framework for any @entity40 military involvement , and for the potential use of @entity40 bases by foreign troops			0
mr @entity7 said he had visited @entity9 to hear directly from service men and women about ‘ their operations , the challenges they face and what support they need			1
’ he announced the two additional @entity17 being sent to the base and confirmed : ‘ we will also extend the lifetime of @entity67 for a further year to april 2016 to ensure we can sustain this effort in the months ahead			1
’ but critics of the cuts that have seen @entity1 fast jet squadrons reduced from 33 at the time of the first @entity73 to seven , said the original decision to axe @entity10 had been ‘ disgraceful ’ and the u-turn was a sign of the chaos within @entity79 planning			1
reprieve : mr @entity7 said that the 102 - year old squadron , which was due to be disbanded in march , would be reprieved until april 2016 as the @entity3 intensified operations against @entity15 targets meeting : mr @entity7 meets pilots , engineers and logistic support staff in front of a @entity12 at @entity24 the @entity17 , which are more than 30 years old , were to have been replaced by @entity87 but incredibly they can not match the weapons capability currently of the older plane – a capability needed for what defence secretary @entity91 has warned could be a three years operation against @entity94			1
missions over @entity5 require the @entity1 to attack small mobile targets such as trucks and even motorcycles and the @entity1 , carrying the @entity100 missile , is suited to this while it will take three years before the @entity102 is fully operational with it			1
air commodore @entity103 , a former air defence chief who commanded forces in @entity5 , said : ‘ this illustrates the chaos in @entity79 planning			1
‘ the @entity1 has been squeezed and squeezed and squeezed and now they have found we have reached the bottom of the barrel			2
’ he added : ‘ if @entity113 is going to be spared , it makes sense			0
it would have been utter folly to get rid of the unit at a time when tasking is increasing by leaps and bounds			0
‘ even though it will have a knock - on effect and create a bit of turmoil , for instance air crews will have already been told their new postings , this is a sensible course of action			0
‘ the @entity129 do n’t have the capabilities to carry out the same role			0
to suggest they do is pie - in - the - sky			0
flying high : the @entity1 aircraft was also due to be withdrawn from service next year , but its operational lifespan will now be extended until 2016 @entity136 : mr @entity7 said he wanted to thank the armed forces for the work they were doing to ' defeat these barbaric @entity141 terrorists ' @entity143 sir @entity142 , the former head of the @entity1 , said : ‘ the decision to cut the @entity1 squadron was pretty disgraceful so i ’m delighted if this has been reversed			1
it is the most sensible thing i ’ve heard in a long time			0
‘ with @entity17 , doing commitments in @entity150 , @entity5 and against jihadists in @entity152 , it just did n’t add up to cut one of the squadrons			2
it would have really put @entity3 ’s ability to sustain operations at risk			0
‘ the cuts were not done on any sensible or logical basis			0
it was a case of the government saying , “ let ’s take a risk on what capabilities we ’ll need ” and that risk has caught up with us			0
’ last week , @entity143 sir @entity91 : ‘ the lack of combat aircraft is a major weakness			0
’ the @entity3 only has three tornado squadrons – two assigned to @entity150 – and @entity10 , from @entity170 , @entity171 , have played a pivotal role in the @entity3 ’s contribution to the @entity176 - led coalition ’s operations against @entity94			2
mr @entity7 was forced to delay scrapping two @entity1 squadrons at the time of the air campaign over @entity180 in 2011			2
the two - seater @entity1 carries a variety of fire power that includes @entity183 , 1,000lb and 2,000lb bombs to target small compounds , @entity187 bunker busters and supersonic @entity100 missiles that can hit moving targets such as enemy fighters in cars or on motorbikes			0
pressure : the prime minister said @entity1 jets had taken part in a dozen sorties , and had carried out strikes on four of those missions - hitting eight targets and helping push back @entity15 militants it currently forms the backbone of the @entity1 ’s ground attack capability so it is seen as ‘ ideal ’ for operations against @entity94			1
@entity94 is said to be stopping large convoys of motorbikes , reducing the number of checkpoints and banning fighters from using @entity210 because it could identify locations , exposing them to attack by the @entity1			2
operating from the giant @entity24 , the @entity17 have been hunting down moving is targets over northern @entity5 having switched from its earlier reconnaissance and surveillance operations			1
. defence chiefs had planned @entity10 would be reformed with @entity102 aircraft and based in @entity218 in @entity219 , @entity220			2
the squadron dates back to 1912 and has a proud history that includes supporting troops in the trenches in @entity225 , overflying the @entity227 beaches at low level , both @entity230 wars , the @entity231 , @entity180 and @entity150			0
it is expected to take another three years before the @entity102 has been cleared to fire @entity100 and all the full weapons payload that the @entity1 , which is due to leave service in 2019 , can currently deliver			2
@entity3 currently has just seven combat - capable air squadrons , compared to 15 for the @entity237 air force .			0
