whatever @entity1 goes on to accomplish in the game , it ’s unlikely he ’ll ever forget this weekend			1
on friday , the 18 - year - old played an integral part in @entity6 ’s 4 - 0 demolition of @entity7 to earn a place in the @entity10 final			2
sometime that evening , he heard news that @entity12 required his services			0
so back he went to @entity14 , sitting amongst the substitutes on the @entity17 bench , the no 37 on his back , as the @entity19 took another big step towards the @entity22 title			1
two goal hero @entity23 holds aloft the trophy as @entity6 win the @entity25 @entity1 was the star of the show in the final , scoring two goals as @entity6 defeated @entity29 3 - 2 goal scorers @entity31 ( left ) and @entity1 pose with their medals in their mouths after sealing victory @entity6 's under 19 squad celebrate their @entity37 victory after an impressive campaign the @entity19 defeated teams of the calibre of @entity41 and @entity7 to reach the final @entity31 and @entity1 clutch the trophy after taking the plaudits for netting the goals @entity6 youngster @entity46 joins fans for a selfie after the final whistle in @entity50 @entity6 : @entity51 ; @entity46 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 ; @entity55 , @entity56 ; @entity1 ( c ) , @entity57 ( @entity58 84 ) , @entity59 ( @entity60 71 ) ; @entity31 substitutes not used : @entity61 ( gk ) ; @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 scorers : @entity1 7 , 55 ; @entity31 47 coach : @entity68 @entity29 : @entity69 ( c ) ; @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 ; @entity74 , @entity75 ; @entity76 ( @entity77 78 ) , @entity78 , @entity79 ( @entity80 71 ) ; @entity81 substitutes not used : @entity82 ( gk ) ; @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 scorers : @entity52 own goal 37 ; @entity80 90 +1 booked : @entity74 , @entity80 coach : @entity90 referee : @entity92 ( @entity93 ) afterwards , it was back to the airport and back to the shores of @entity97			1
and there , on monday afternoon , he pulled on the captain ’s armband once more and scored two goals to inspire @entity6 ’s academy side to @entity37 glory			1
there ’s never a frown with @entity23 , it would seem			2
his excellent individual performance was one of many as the @entity19 dominated @entity29 to become the second name , after @entity112 , to be inscribed on the handsome @entity10 trophy			1
the @entity115 winger @entity59 was dangerous throughout and crafted the two goals - one for @entity31 , the other for @entity1 - early in the second - half that finally rewarded @entity6 ’s dominance			1
as for @entity31 , his place on the scoresheet was just inevitable			2
the deadly @entity123 under 18 striker has made this tournament his own , thriving on the @entity37 stage			0
his 47th - minute goal , a towering header from @entity128 ’s perfect , dinked delivery from the left , took his season ’s tally to 12			0
@entity31 is , by some distance , the tournament ’s top goalscorer and it ’s greatest success this year			2
@entity1 , who was snatched away from @entity139 's youtyh system , fired home to give @entity6 the lead @entity1 races off to celebrate his opening strike closely followed by his @entity6 team - mates @entity1 , who was named on the bench for @entity6 's game against @entity147 on sunday , celebrates his second goal @entity1 is mobbed on the floor as team - mates rush to congratulate him for his opener @entity152 @entity6 4 - 1 @entity153 @entity154 0 - 5 @entity6 @entity6 2 - 0 @entity155 @entity155 0 - 7 @entity6 @entity153 2 - 0 @entity6 chlesea 6 - 0 @entity154 last 16 : @entity6 3 - 1 @entity156 quarter - finals : @entity6 2 - 0 @entity41 semi-finals : @entity6 4 - 0 @entity7 final : @entity6 3 - 2 @entity29 indeed , he might have had a hat - trick , somehow failing to connect with a drilled low @entity57 cross two yards out on the stroke of half - time and blazing over from point - blank range when @entity1 teed him up in the second period			1
@entity12 recognised his hot form with a senior debut against @entity155 in the @entity169 back in october			0
we now wait and wonder whether he ’ll get any more first - team action , something that can be easily extended to all these players			0
@entity1 has also been involved with the first - team squad and his two goals here were both well - conceived and clinically finished			0
he gave @entity6 , who had racked up 33 goals in nine matches in reaching this point , the perfect start after just seven minutes			0
showing no signs of fatigue after all that commuting , @entity1 thundered home @entity31 ’s low cross , culminating one of the many intricate passing moves @entity6 put together in the game			1
his second - @entity6 ’s third - came on 55 minutes and killed the contest			0
@entity59 took his time in assessing the options in front of him and eventually found @entity1 inside the area			2
the captain swiveled and placed a fine left - footed shot into the far corner			0
@entity29 drew level when @entity19 defender @entity52 ( centre ) scored an own goal in the first - half leading scorer @entity31 put @entity6 back in the lead shortly after the interval with a close range header @entity6 striker @entity31 wheels away after netting in the @entity19 ' 3 - 2 victory over @entity29 @entity31 celebrates his goal with the impressive @entity59 who provided the assist @entity31 leaps for joy after handing @entity6 the lead while becoming the tournament 's top scorer that knocked the stuffing out of @entity29 ’s challenge			1
the @entity216 had reached this point having not lost a game , though they had laboured in overcoming @entity219 in the last 16 and @entity220 in the quarter - finals , winning both on penalties			0
they had also come from behind to beat @entity224 3 - 1 in friday ’s semi-final , that contest a stark contrast to the ease of @entity6 ’s demolition of @entity7			0
having created little of note , they drew level late in the first - half when the unfortunate @entity6 centre - half @entity52 diverted a dangerous @entity76 cross beyond his goalkeeper @entity51			1
the @entity237 under 21 defender looked crestfallen but the wrong was quickly righted by @entity6 ’s rapier - sharp attack			2
@entity1 completed his brace with a drilled shot from outside the area in the second half @entity6 's rising star goes to celebrate with team - mate @entity57 after netting the eventual winner @entity6 youth manager @entity247 rallies his troops from the touchline @entity115 attacking midfielder @entity59 , who set up two goals for the @entity19 during the match , takes a free - kick @entity6 youngsters , led by @entity254 , begin their celebrations by raising aloft the trophy @entity6 youth manager @entity68 raises the @entity258 trophy as his side are crowned champions a second for @entity29 , through substitute @entity80 in stoppage time , came too late to change the outcome			1
and as @entity1 lifted the @entity10 trophy beneath cloudless skies in this most picturesque of venues , @entity6 strengthened their claim to have @entity123 ’s best academy			1
they are the defending under 21 @entity22 champions and will put their @entity272 title on the line against @entity274 next week			0
success on the @entity37 stage only adds another trophy to their collection			0
the real test comes in seeing whether @entity1 , @entity31 , @entity59 and the rest of their talented cohort can graduate to @entity6 ’s first team			1
while the likes of @entity10 president @entity285 and even former @entity6 defender @entity286 were expected guests at the @entity10 final , there was one familiar face in the stands who did cause a surprise ... former @entity294 secretary - general @entity293			2
former @entity294 secretary - general @entity293 revealed himself as a football fan by attending the final			0

@entity6 captain @entity23 opened the scoring from close range on *7mins*
@entity19 defender @entity52 scored an own goal to level the score
@entity31 handed the initiative back to @entity6 after the interval
@entity1 netted a second but @entity247 's side could have won by more
substitute @entity80 scored an *injury* time *consolation* for @entity29
