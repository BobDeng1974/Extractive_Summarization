the way we walk is unique when compared to our closest living relatives , the ape			1
but scientists are not sure when our skeleton evolved to create this distinction , which is one of the questions driving the study of human evolution today			1
now , researchers believe the answer could lie in our big toes			0
scientists have developed a new method of analysing long bones , such as the hallucal metatarsal - the shaft of the foot bone that links to the big toe - in order to study differences between the feet of humans and apes			1
the method shows structural differences in different colours , as shown above an interdisciplinary team led by scientists at the @entity29 in @entity30 , @entity31 , has combined visualisation techniques , engineering principles and statistical analysis into a new way of analysing the structure of long bones			1
they used it to document foot differences between humans and apes , so that variations were highlighted in a rainbow of colours			1
this work will be the starting point for future studies , which could investigate how far back in our evolutionary history the modern human pattern of bone structure in the hallucal metatarsal – the shaft of the foot bone that ’s connected to the big toe - emerged			0
scientists are not sure when our skeleton evolved to create our unique walk , but they believe the answer could lie in our big toes , which we use in the propulsive phase of walking , unlike apes which use it to climb and grasp			1
a computer graphic showing a version of the @entity63 is pictured podiatrist @entity64 claims that the condition of our feet can indicate health problems			0
they are composed of 26 major bones and joints and the way humans walk depends on the way they move in relation to each other			2
@entity77 of this , flat feet can indicate curvature of the spine and distorted toes can signify rheumatoid - arthritis later in life			0
' a slow pulse can signify poor circulation and , for example , rolling ankles - a condition where ankles roll inwards - can show incorrect posture , which can lead to severe back pain , ' he said			0
returning red ulcers could indicate diabetes , which affects 1.4 million people in @entity96 , while discoloured feet could hint at circulatory problems			0
as well as offering crucial evolutionary insights into the timing and appearance of modern human gait , they believe the method will advance the study of bone biology in hominin fossils			0
they focused on the hallucal metatarsal in groups of modern humans , gorillas and chimpanzees , because the big toe , or hallux , plays a pivotal role during the propulsive phase of walking and running in humans			0
in other living apes , the big toe is more thumb - like so it can be used for grasping and climbing			2
their method , which is described in the journal @entity123 , allowed them to detect differences in the shape and size of the bone in the modern species , by creating images from ct scans to make a ‘ colour map ’ where different qualities and properties of the bone are shown in different colours			1
dr @entity137 explained : ‘ this study is an exemplar proof - of - principle analysis for a technique that can advance the general fields of bone biology and functional morphology by introducing a powerful new means of analysing long bone shafts , particularly their structural properties			2
‘ in our first study , we have documented exciting structural differences between humans , chimpanzees , and gorillas , some of which were predictable based on their gait differences			1
‘ the unexpected structural differences we observed are equally intriguing			2
we are eager now to begin examining how far back in evolutionary time these differences can be traced .			0

researchers from the @entity29 developed a new technique to analyse the shape of bones in feet
they have used it to show the structural differences between the feet of humans and apes in different colours , which may explain the way we walk
they say the method could one day *reveal* when our skeleton evolved to make us walk differently from our closest living relatives
