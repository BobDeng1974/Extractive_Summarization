in the two days after a section of @entity3 fans booed their team from the field following defeat to @entity7 , @entity0 got out of the midlands			1
not because this 56 - year - old @entity9 could n't handle the heat , but rather he had @entity11 matches to watch			2
on the sunday , he was at @entity12 as @entity14 ’s ' @entity13 ' illustrated their attacking force while just about hiding their defensive frailties in the 4 - 0 win over @entity20			1
@entity0 punches the air in delight after his @entity3 team beat @entity24 1 - 0 on sunday @entity0 celebrates as @entity25 heads his team 's winner at @entity28 @entity25 heads home the @entity3 ' winner at @entity24 with 16 minutes remaining on the monday , he travelled to the @entity31 as @entity32 and @entity33 announced themselves to @entity36 football in a pulsating 2 - 2 draw between @entity38 and @entity39			1
in 48 hours , roughly 400 miles covered as @entity40 sought to scout future opponents and get a measure of what his team will face this season			1
rather than rely on videos or reports , he wants to witness as much football first - hand as possible			2
at training , he is first to arrive , typically by 7am , reminiscent of another of @entity53 ’s football sons			2
the sessions are said to be the best many of the players have experienced			0
that is not to say any of this is particularly unusual for a @entity11 manager – or in @entity0 ’s case , head coach – but the point is this is a talented man working hard enough to be afforded time in a role not without its difficulties			1
in the summer 13 senior players left , with 11 arriving – a change in personnel greater even than @entity70 has had to manage at @entity71			2
knitting the team together was made trickier by the number of new recruits who had missed pre-season and were not yet fit enough to play			0
@entity0 was at @entity12 on a scouting mission as @entity14 beat @entity20 4 - 0 a week - and - a - half ago a day later , @entity0 was at the @entity31 to see @entity32 head home in @entity38 's 2 - 2 draw with @entity39 @entity0 's work ethic , including being first at the training ground every day , is comparable to sir @entity82 's @entity83 has the opportunity to test his talents against @entity11 defenders with @entity24 as @entity88 opposition for @entity89 on wednesday night			1
he hulking striker has scored eight goals in the @entity92 already , after being bought for £ 5.5million from @entity93			0
that looked steep , but if he nets at @entity28 then the perspective really does flip			0
the 21 - year - old has the potential to play higher			1
the results were uninspiring – draws with @entity100 and @entity71 ( although that 0 - 0 at @entity101 ’s now looks better in context ) and defeats to @entity103 and @entity7			1
heading into their match at @entity24 , @entity3 were as long as 7/1 to win			1
bottom place in the table beckoned			0
that they deservedly came away with three points is a credit to @entity40 ’s training sessions and tactics as much as a signal of further @entity24 malaise			1
with it , @entity3 ’s position and @entity0 ’s credibility took a leap			1
there was anger from fans when @entity0 was announced as next in line after @entity123			2
scarred from a season of three managers and flirtation with relegation , they craved a sign that this campaign would be different			0
understandably , a bigger name was desired			0
better still , someone with @entity11 experience			0
@entity136 , just an individual who had not been sacked at his last two jobs would do			0
@entity0 replaced @entity123 , who left @entity137 at the end of last season irvine previous worked in @entity141 's coaching staff at both @entity142 and @entity7 @entity0 was also in charge at @entity144 in 2010 & 2011 , but could n't stop them dropping to @entity146 what do @entity148 ’s @entity147 and @entity150 ’s @entity149 have in common ? before any jokes about their respective abilities as midfielders , you should know each sidestepped agents to call their current clubs direct and get their transfers sorted			1
occasionally middlemen only end up creating a muddle			0
but @entity0 it was , selected by chairman @entity162 under recommendation from technical director @entity164			2
they looked into the details of @entity40 ’s chastening experiences at @entity142 and @entity144 and found on each occasion the cord was cut at a very early period of downturn			0
they listened to figures within the game , who told of @entity0 ’s ability to improve players on the training fields and create relationships with those under his instruction			1
@entity182 admires @entity0 from their time together at @entity7 and joined soon after the @entity184 was unveiled			1
( he reminded what a good defender he is in that shut - out at @entity28 , his first game for six months			0
) importantly , @entity40 works within @entity3 ’s continental structure			2
@entity189 , who priced himself out of the job , wanted two assistants			0
clearly one win over @entity24 does not dispel all the doubt about @entity40 , especially in the eyes of fans , but it means wednesday night ’s @entity88 tie against @entity38 will be played in an upbeat atmosphere			1
@entity198 visit the @entity199 on sunday in a match @entity3 will want three points from , although with only four goals scored by these teams combined it promises to be a tight encounter			1
@entity0 is likely to stand at the edge of the technical area in club tracksuit once more before changing into suit and tie for media duties			2
firm handshakes will greet those searching for such			0
then there will be trips across the land , as @entity40 endeavours to make this third opportunity at management last longer than his others			0
he deserves that chance .			0

@entity0 travelled 400 miles on a scouting mission after @entity3 's home defeat to @entity7 and is always first on the training ground
the @entity184 's work ethic has been compared to sir @entity82
@entity0 oversaw *wholesale* changes to the playing staff over the summer
he is starting to get results , as shown by sunday 's 1 - 0 win at @entity24
that win ensures a positive atmosphere when @entity3 play @entity38 in @entity88 on wednesday night
