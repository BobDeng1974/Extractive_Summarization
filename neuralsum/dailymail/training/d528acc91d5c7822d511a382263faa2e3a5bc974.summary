by @entity0 published : 06:27 est , 1 august 2012 updated : 05:35 est , 2 august 2012 a mother has lost a discrimination battle she was fighting against online giant @entity3 as the final wish of her dying son			1
@entity3 worker @entity6 , 36 , launched a discrimination case against the shopping website when he was sent home from the @entity11 warehouse without pay with a mystery illness			1
but before mr @entity6 could see his case come to court , his illness was diagnosed as cancer and he died in february			1
his mother @entity18 promised her dying son she would take up his battle but a judge found that they were not guilty of discrimination because they did not know about @entity6 's disease			1
mrs @entity26 lost the fight on @entity6 's behalf ( pictured left ) as he wanted to take @entity3 to court @entity3 denied discriminating against @entity6 and say they could not let him work while he was in so much pain			1
mrs @entity26 , 62 , appeared alone before an employment tribunal yesterday to accuse @entity3 of disability discrimination against her son at their distribution warehouse in @entity11 , @entity36			2
she rejected getting a solicitor to present the case herself to an employment judge and said : ' when he knew it was cancer he asked me to pursue this tribunal process for him			2
' he knew it was too late to help him but he just hoped it might help others			0
this is what has been driving me			0
' the mother - of - three said @entity3 should not have kept her son away from work without pay while he was ill. the hearing in @entity53 was told how keen windsurfer @entity6 first suffered from cancer in 1998			1
the disease did not develop and he continued with his life having regular checkups with his gp			0
@entity6 started working for @entity3 through an agency in september 2008 before becoming a full time member of staff in july 2009			1
when he was taken on by the company he filled in a questionnaire telling them about his medical problems			0
this was passed onto @entity3 's occupational provider @entity68			2
but when @entity6 started complaining of back problems in november 2009 the company did not pass the relevant information onto his bosses			0
heavy lifting : the mother says @entity6 was forced to do strenuous work in the @entity3 warehouse when he was unwell and then sent home without pay employment judge @entity79 said : ' @entity68 should have put two and two together and noticed a link between his history of cancer and the back pain he suffered			1
' but @entity3 could not have been expected to make the link themselves			0
' mrs @entity26 said that when @entity6 was told to go home because his role was causing him too much pain , he had been excluded from work : ' it was additional worry causing him stress at a time when he needed it least			2
' it affected him emotionally and financially , he was not allowed to go to work , not given any reason and not paid			0
' the hearing was told that @entity6 had used up his paid sickness leave and had no other source of income			0
he fell behind with payments on his car insurance and ended up being unable to drive			0
@entity6 was forced to lodge a grievance with @entity3 in a desperate attempt to get back to work			1
this took two months for @entity3 deal with while they tried to get his doctors records and @entity6 never received the results			1
@entity3 , who have since changed their occupational health providers , were criticised by mr @entity79 for the way they dealt with @entity6 's case			1
mr @entity79 added : ' as an act of desperation @entity6 issued a grievance , he made it crystal clear he was suffering physically , emotionally and financially			2
' warring with a giant : the mother says after her son was sent home without pay , he fell behind on his bills ad payments ' @entity3 would have been left in no doubt about the impact this was having on him			1
' but the delay in there obtaining the medical notes was unacceptable and for whatever reason he never received the results - and this was inexcusable behaviour			0
mr @entity79 also said that @entity3 should have considered putting @entity6 on full paid medical suspension			1
speaking after the case @entity138 said : ' i am naturally saddened by the decision that has been handed down by the employment tribunal today			0
' when @entity6 knew he was too ill to return to work , it was still my son 's wish to continue to fight his case as he felt that it might at least help others			2
' during the last few months of his life my son was made to suffer the most awful financial and emotional distress that added greatly to the physical difficulties that had begun to beset him			0
' i have now done everything that i could have in an attempt to get justice for my son			0
' for me it was still worth the fight if it serves to improve @entity3 's practices and prevents anyone else suffering unnecessarily			0

son was sent home with a mystery illness later diagnosed as cancer
his mother promised him she would take the *international* giant to court
after being sent home , @entity6 fell behind with his bills and payments
judge rules in *favour* of online giant
@entity3 say they did not act in a discriminatory way
