taken hundreds of feet in the sky , these spectacular birds - eye photos taken by cameras fixed to manned drones show the stunning beauty of buildings and communities around the world			1
but attempting to recreate these amazing pictures is now much more difficult - and in some cases impossible - as a result of a clampdown on the use of drones for photographic purposes			0
@entity15 photographer @entity14 travelled the world during the 18 months with a quadcopter in his backpack between 2012 and 2014 when it was easier to take aerial pictures using a drone			1
