how on earth has @entity0 escaped criticism for yet another failure in @entity4 ? they won on the night – fine			1
they went out on away goals – sure , it could n't have been closer			0
but they lost to @entity10 – arguably the worst side to make it through the group stage			1
@entity15 's goal against @entity10 was not enough to prevent @entity16 going out of the @entity17 @entity16 players look dejected after losing the 3 - 1 at home to the @entity21 side in the first leg of the last - 16 tie @entity10 defender @entity24 celebrates his team 's shock victory at the @entity27 last month @entity16 manager @entity0 appears to have escaped criticism for yet another failure in @entity4 failing to win the group has been @entity0 's massive error in recent seasons			1
that 's why they 've faced the @entity36 giants early and failed to make the quarter - finals			2
and yet again , despite being in a group with two no - hopers – @entity40 and @entity41 , and a @entity43 side that spent the first half of the season hovering in and around the relegation zone in the @entity47 – @entity16 failed to top their group			1
but they got that stroke of luck everyone says you need if you are going to win the @entity17			2
they were paired with @entity10 , a team defensively sound but offensively weak			2
i 'm going to keep this simple : @entity16 have better players than @entity10			1
so surely an experienced manager , well versed in @entity21 football and @entity17 football , especially familiar with his opponents – a club he once managed – with a squad featuring two arguably world - class players in @entity65 and @entity66 , not even @entity0 could mess this one up ? @entity0 failed even with world - class talent like @entity65 ( pictured ) and @entity66 in his @entity16 side @entity16 boss @entity0 looks on and sinks into his seat during @entity16 's shock defeat by @entity10 @entity10 are effective , but they are a basic side			1
in other words , it should n't take a tactical genius to work out how to beat them			0
they got into the @entity17 thanks to the quality of @entity78 and @entity79 ( before his injury ) , but they have since lost those star players			2
and yet @entity0 failed to do this			1
for the fifth season running @entity16 failed to make the quarter - finals of the @entity17			1
damage done in the first leg , and @entity87 said their mentality was n't right			0
therefore the manager has to take the blame for sending his players out with the wrong mentality			0
last season , @entity87 said @entity16 ' gave 10 per cent less mentally ' when they were beaten by @entity94 to miss out on top spot in the group			1
wenger culpable for not preparing his players properly yet again			0
his preparation of his own team is poor			0
his ability to out - coach opponents is poor			0
and still there are people who think he is the right man to manage @entity16			0
some even have the audacity to cling on to that well - worn myth that he had every right not to win big trophies while @entity16 paid for the stadium			2
hard to believe gullible @entity112 fell for that one			0
the income and assets from day one at the new stadium meant @entity16 could always compete			0
unfortunately @entity0 misjudged the impact of @entity117 , another mistake he made			0
the case for @entity0 's defence is getting weaker and weaker			1
per @entity87 admitted @entity16 's mentality was n't right as @entity16 failed to reach the quarter - finals sure , three other @entity124 clubs failed in the @entity17 this season			1
@entity126 might change their manager because of it			0
that 's a man who won the title last season			0
@entity133 know that they have a manager who has already won the @entity17 twice before , so his track record is proven			0
but we all know that if he persistently fails to get to the quarter - finals of the @entity17 , @entity137 wo n't last at @entity139			2
and at @entity141 @entity140 went into his first ever @entity17 campaign shorn of @entity143 and the injured @entity144			1
he was a rookie and he made big mistakes			0
@entity0 is making equally huge mistakes despite all his years of @entity36 experience			0
so many people are sitting around wringing their hands about why @entity124 clubs fail in @entity4			0
no wonder we fail when a club as huge as @entity16 trusts a proven @entity36 failure with its @entity17 ambitions , and then does nothing when he fails time after time			1
@entity126 were eliminated from the @entity17 by @entity157 and could now change their boss @entity159 celebrates scoring for @entity160 against @entity133 while @entity161 boss @entity137 shows his frustration he 's the only manager to reach three different @entity36 finals and lose them all – @entity164 with @entity10 , @entity165 and @entity17 with @entity16			1
@entity0 's 17 straight seasons in the @entity17 are an embarrassment when you consider he has only reached one final , and two semi-finals in that time			1
is there anyone else who could do better ? there really are people stupid enough to ask that question			0
if you want a young manager who will be bold and brave in the face of bigger - spending more illustrious opponents then go for the youthful energy of @entity182 or @entity183			0
both have won domestic titles in recent seasons when they could have done what @entity0 does every year and wave the white flag because he ca n't handle what he calls the ' financial doping ' of the likes of @entity126 and @entity133			2
if you want proven winners , then @entity0 's £ 8m - a - year salary will surely tempt the quality of @entity195 or @entity196			1
@entity0 's £ 8m - a - year salary would surely tempt @entity196 ( left ) and @entity195 to north @entity198 why is it that a juggernaut of a club like @entity16 sticks with a manager who regularly fails when it comes to the big moments ? are they content to miss out ? finishing second was n't good enough for @entity206 , remember ? so he left the stinking , sinking ship to go and finish first with @entity157			1
that was a long , long time ago of course , but still the fallen @entity27 empire remains ruined			0
the failure to win the @entity17 will always be a huge scabby wart on @entity0 's record			1
but @entity0 is n't bigger than @entity16			2
he 's guilty of failing in @entity4 with @entity16 and making a massive contribution to the diminishing reputation of @entity124 clubs in @entity36 competition			1
being knocked out by @entity10 should be the final straw for @entity0			2
it would be for any other manager of one of @entity4 's elite clubs .			2

@entity0 failed in @entity4 as @entity16 were beaten by @entity10
the @entity227 have not *progressed* past the last 16 in five seasons
@entity16 had also failed to top their @entity17 group
@entity0 has world - class players but messed up against the @entity21 side
@entity195 and @entity196 could be tempted by @entity0 's salary
