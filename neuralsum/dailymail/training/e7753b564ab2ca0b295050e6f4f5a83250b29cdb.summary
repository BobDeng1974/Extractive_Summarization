a mystery ' storm cloud ' caught on weather radar after erupting off a @entity4 military missile testing ground in @entity5 has left weather experts baffled			1
conspiracy theorists have speculated that the plume - like cloud , which seems to appear out of nowhere , could have been kicked up by the explosion from an unreported weapons test			1
deepening the mystery , @entity4 @entity13 offices in @entity14 and @entity15 have confirmed the reading , but say they have no idea where it could have come from			1
the mysterious plume as it appeared on the radar at @entity22 as it headed toward @entity23			2
weather experts are baffled about where it could have come from the plume was tracked north - east , over @entity23 near @entity28 , home of the 27th @entity29 , over @entity30 in north @entity31 and towards the @entity33 border the plume first appeared at sunset on monday evening over the part of the vast @entity37 in east @entity38 , close to the ' @entity39 ' where the first atomic bomb was detonated in 1945			1
it was spotted in publicly accessible radar data by a blogger , who tracked its progress and has published his findings in two @entity48 videos and a blog post			2
he showed how the @entity51 's storm identification system had detected the plume as a strong storm cell which seemingly emerged out of nowhere on a clear night			0
a second view of the plume , on the @entity58 's @entity57 service , showed how it appeared to burst out of a small point , like the aftermath of a massive explosion			0
the plume was tracked north - east , over @entity23 near @entity28 , home of the 27th @entity29 , over @entity30 in north @entity31 and towards the @entity33 border , where it appeared to dissipate			0
a closer look at the whereabouts of the beginning of the apparent weather event showed that it emerged from the @entity37 , a site which extends to some 3,200 sq / miles across @entity5 that is used as a proving ground for the @entity4 military 's ballistic missiles			1
in its previous incarnation as the @entity37 , the site played host to the ' @entity39 ' test of the world 's first atomic bomb on july 16 , 1945			1
in that test scientists from the @entity79 exploded a 20 kiloton plutonium bomb of the same kind as the @entity83 device that was a month later dropped on the @entity85 city of @entity86 , killing 40,000 people instantly			2
there is as yet no evidence of a nuclear explosion			0
the @entity4 has not officially tested any atomic weapons since signing the @entity92 in 1992			1
the @entity39 , where the world 's first atomic bomb was detonated in july 1945 , which is close to the source of the unexplained plume on the @entity37 the trinity test explosion pictured 0.016 seconds after detonation			1
the 20 kiloton plutonium bomb was of the same kind as the @entity83 device that was a month later dropped on the @entity85 city of @entity86 nevertheless the bizarre ' weather ' event 's appearance over a military site has led to speculation that some kind of massive weapon has been exploded at white sands , propelling a huge amount of particulate debris into the atmosphere			2
with the @entity116 volcanic field just east of the site , another possible explanation could that a volcanic eruption - which has gone unreported for whatever reason - could be the source of the plume			0
there have been been no eyewitness reports or photographs of the plume , and no official statements from agencies involved in either missile testing or geology			0
weather experts told @entity128 4 that they have no idea what it could be			0
so , whatever the source of the reading , the consensus appears to be that it was not weather related .			0

there is speculation that the cloud could be the result of a weapons test
but the @entity4 has not done @entity142 tests since the @entity92 in 1992
