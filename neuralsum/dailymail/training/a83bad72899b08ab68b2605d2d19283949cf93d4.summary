whatever else @entity1 achieves in his return to @entity5 football , he has found a way to get @entity7 smiling again			1
it 's barely been a week since @entity11 's @entity10 manager had a good moan about results and performances that he even he found ugly			1
what a difference a few days can make			0
what a difference this particular striker can make			0
his second goal in three @entity20 fixtures was n't enough to win this one - @entity21 saw to that against with an equaliser against the side he inspired on loan last season - but it has given his manager cause to think of brighter times			1
@entity11 's winger @entity29 ( left ) tussles for the ball with @entity33 's @entity32 ( right ) at the @entity34 the @entity11 ' @entity36 defender @entity35 ( left ) challenges the @entity38 ' @entity5 midfielder @entity37 ( right ) @entity33 forward @entity39 ( centre ) runs with the ball but is closed down by @entity42 ( right ) and @entity43 ( left ) there were those who doubted the logic in paying Â£ 70,000 a week to a 32 - year - old who just one year ago decided the time was right for some @entity49			1
but that noise will have dimmed after his goal in the win over @entity54 last weekend and it will have surely disappeared altogether after his magnificent strike in the first half at @entity33			1
as it happens , it was a goal that meant he is the only player to have scored against all 20 of the current @entity20 clubs			1
but more than racking up statistics , the striker is showing the form that ought to keep @entity11 safe			2
it 's why @entity7 faces a dilemma			0
he said : ' without any doubt we are a different team with him			0
when you have a player who you know sooner or later will score it makes a difference			0

he has n't played in four months			0
but sorry , @entity1 , i ca n't			2
' the idea is to not take risk but i ca n't let games go past without playing @entity1			2
from our first conversation , over whether it was it too early to make a start against @entity133 ( in his debut ) , he never had a doubt			0
he always wants to play			0
' naturally , talk has already talked to the possibility of an @entity5 call up			0
@entity7 added : ' when you pick strikers you pick those in form and scoring goals			0
we saw @entity143 against @entity144 - it 's an obvious choice			2

' @entity11 striker @entity105 ( left ) advances on goal as @entity33 defender @entity84 appeals for an offside decision @entity11 's january signing , striker @entity1 ( right ) is tackled by @entity33 defender @entity83 ( left ) @entity11 goalkeeper @entity76 ( right ) saves from close range to stop @entity39 ( centre ) scoring the opening goal minutes later , @entity39 misses another chance to give @entity33 the lead after being put clean through @entity162 ( left ) battles for the ball with @entity11 playmaker @entity104 ( right ) at the @entity34 @entity1 scores with a right footed shot from outside the box into the bottom left corner to give @entity11 a 1 - 0 lead @entity1 joined @entity11 from @entity49 side @entity170 during the january transfer window and has scored two goals in five games @entity1 's goal against @entity33 means that the striker has now scored against every current @entity20 side			1
for @entity99 , the frustration was obvious			0
aside from the goal they conceded , this was a game @entity33 largely dominated			2
@entity39 was denied after going clean through at the end of a delightful six - man , first - half move and @entity21 also had a goal disallowed			1
almost immediately , @entity1 took possession just inside @entity33 's half and easily beat @entity83 before finishing from 20 yards			1
@entity21 levelled after the break , but @entity99 said : ' it was frustrating			2
we had enough good chances to take the points			0
the only shot they had was the goal - we gave @entity1 too much space			1

i will have to tell @entity21 to cut his hair			0
