@entity0 , formerly known as the @entity1 , has taken its first steps into the political jungle with a manifesto the @entity1 once taught young women to cope away from civilisation with camping trips and nature skills			2
now , they are more concerned with helping them face the challenges of modern life			0
the youth group yesterday took its first step into politics , demanding school lessons in body confidence and equal numbers of men and women in @entity21			1
it said ‘ young women still believe they are too often treated like second - class citizens ’			0
claiming that three quarters of teenage girls believe sexism affects most areas of their lives , the @entity1 said that there is ‘ overwhelming evidence of inequality for girls in the @entity34			1
’ its campaign , launched at the outset of the party conference season , made eight demands it said politicians should promise to meet in advance of next year ’s general election			2
they included a call for equal representation in @entity21 for men and women , ‘ modernised ’ sex education in schools , a ban on ‘ harmful sexualised content in mainstream media ’ , and a rule that all schools must teach ‘ body confidence and gender equality ’			1
the manifesto was instantly praised by @entity59 leaders			0
@entity60 said the campaign ‘ addresses issues which are important to the @entity59 ’ and added that the party already uses all - women shortlists to select candidates and is planning to go further towards the @entity1 ’ demands			1
shadow equalities minister @entity67 said the guides ‘ are doing great work to make sure girls ’ voices are heard by politicians			1
’ the intervention into politics is the latest step in a radical re-alignment of the girls ’ movement over the past two years			0
the guides – who now call themselves @entity0 – have removed references to loving @entity82 and serving country from the promise all members must make			2
instead of professing patriotism and religious faith , girls joining the organisation will have to promise ‘ to be true to myself ’ and ‘ to serve my community ’			1
the guides now offer their members a badge in what the movement ’s leaders call body confidence training , in which girls are encouraged to develop their self - image by looking for airbrushing in magazine pictures and talking about sex			1
@entity0 has also brought in a chief executive , @entity103 , who used to lead the contraception and sex educaton pressure group fpa			0
@entity60 said the campaign addressed issues that were important to labour while shadow equalities minister @entity67 ( right ) said guides were doing ' great work ' the changes have come at a time when membership increases have been slow compared to the guides ’ rival movement , the @entity115			1
the guides new ‘ @entity117 ’ campaign includes a call to politicians to ensure ‘ that girls should not have to grow up afraid to walk down the street or accept harassment as commonplace or feel embarrassed and undermined by the way women are portrayed in the media			1
’ one of the figures behind the campaign , 17 - year - old @entity128 , said : ‘ the government is inclined to forget those who are not present among them			0
girls and young women are a demographic constantly being told that they have no right to a voice			0
’ miss @entity103 said : ‘ we have a responsibility as the leading charity for girls and young women to ensure their voices are head on the issues that affect them			0
' within guiding we have young women who are passionate and determined to bring about positive societal change to help make lives for their peers here and around the world better			0
’ @entity151 mp said the campaign may ' disservice ' girls the campaign is based on claims , gathered from surveys commissioned by the @entity1 , that nearly nine out of 10 girls aged between 11 and 21 think women are judged on appearance rather than ability ; that three quarters think there are too many pictures of naked women in the media ; and seven out of 10 aged over 13 say they have been sexually harassed			1
three quarters say ‘ girls are judged harshly for sexual behaviour seen as acceptable in boys ’			2
its political demands included that schools stamp out sexual bullying and harassment , and that @entity34 aid policies should make girls ’ rights a priority			2
@entity60 said that @entity59 would take the @entity1 ’ demands into account when drawing up its election manifesto			1
‘ the @entity117 campaign is a great campaign , addressing issues which are important to the @entity59 , ’ mr @entity60 said			1
‘ we are already committed to introducing compulsory sex education in schools and girls and young women ’s voices are essential in helping us to shape that			1
' we are also committed to looking at how we enforce a zero - tolerance approach to sexual bullying and harassment , not just in schools but in all areas of life			0
‘ i am committed to working towards having a @entity197 , a @entity21 and a party where women are equally represented			2
' my party is pushing this forward through the use of all - women shortlists but there is more we all need to do to make equality in political life a reality			0
’ tories were less impressed , however			0
backbench @entity210 @entity209 , a former guide who is mp for @entity213 and @entity214 , said : ‘ @entity0 is a hugely important organisation who i enjoy working with , but it is a shame that they have not recognised the work that the government is already doing to combat many of the issues they raise			0
' sadly i fear this may do a disservice to the girls they seek to empower			0
