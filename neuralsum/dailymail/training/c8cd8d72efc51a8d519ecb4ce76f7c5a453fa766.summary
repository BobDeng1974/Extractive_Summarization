a priest has been found dead of a gunshot wound to the head in @entity7 's southern @entity6 state , his diocese said friday			1
rev. @entity9 's death marks the latest in a series of abductions , attacks and highway robberies against @entity15 clerics in the state which is dominated by drug cartels			1
he is the third @entity15 priest to have been killed in the region this year , and the first to die since the federal government launched a special , stepped - up security operation in the area following the disappearance of 43 teachers ' college students three months ago			1
@entity9 was apparently kidnapped by the gang early monday ; his truck was found abandoned two days later			1
' this is another priest added to those who have died for their love of @entity42 , ' bishop @entity30 said			1
' enough already of so much pain , of so many murders			2
enough already of so much crime			0
' that was an apparent reference to the ' protection payments ' that the local drug gang , the @entity50 , demand from business owners in @entity35			0
a monument in honor of @entity7 's former president @entity55 stands along a highway between @entity57 and @entity35 on the state border of @entity6 and @entity59 , @entity7 one business owner , who did not want to be named for fear of reprisals , said his family had been forced to pay thousands of pesos each year to the gang for the right to operate a pharmacy			1
while the rev. @entity68 said gangs have also demanded protection payments from parish priests in the nearby resort city of @entity73 , @entity9 did n't have a parish or collect tithes			2
but bishop @entity30 said there could be other motives : priests have received threats when they refuse to perform quickie marriages or baptisms for drug gang members			0
the church normally requires extensive paperwork before performing such ceremonies			0
' at times , if they ask for a baptism and you do n't do it , they start to threaten you , ' @entity30 said			0
' they want a marriage , or a blessing ' for a car or a home , he said , and wo n't take ' no ' for an answer			0
the @entity99 of @entity100 issued a statement saying ' we demand authorities clear up this and so many other crimes that have caused pain in so many homes , and ensure that it is punished			2
' but @entity68 said there appears to be little likelihood authorities will find the killers , because they have n't done so in past cases			0
' the government offers to investigate , but nothing is ever known , ' he said referring to the other recent killing of a priest in the @entity35 diocese			1
a view of the seminary in @entity35 , @entity7 , - rev. @entity119 disappeared after he was apparently kidnapped from this local seminary on monday in september , the battered body of the rev. @entity122 was found floating in the @entity123 near his parish of @entity126 , near @entity35			1
@entity6 state prosecutors said the priest 's body had head wounds , but it was unclear whether they were caused by the body being dragged by the current , or whether he had been killed before being dumped in the river			1
@entity30 said authorities never offered more information on the investigation into his death			0
residents of @entity126 told reporters that @entity122 was well liked in the town , but they were afraid to speak more about his death , or the gang that operates in the area			0
the town is an area dominated by the @entity149 drug cartel , which has been implicated in the mass killing of 43 students in september in the nearby city of @entity153			2
the area is so dangerous that @entity30 said one priest had been briefly kidnapped in the mountains above @entity126 by cartel gunmen who complained the priest had been speaking in favor of ' @entity159 ' — the name of a rival drug cartel			2
the priest had to quickly explain he had been preaching in favor of family values , not the rival cartel			2
nor have authorities cleared up the killing of a @entity169 priest whose body was found in a clandestine grave in a nearby @entity6 diocese in november			1
father @entity173 , 55 , had been kidnapped about six months earlier			0
his body was later identified as one of 13 found in a clandestine grave discovered nov. 2 in the town of @entity178			2
@entity173 , a member of the @entity180 order , was abducted april 30 in the town of @entity182 after celebrating @entity183 , when a group of people in an suv intercepted his car			0
several priests have also been victims of highway assaults in @entity6 in recent months that appear to be attempted robberies			1
church officials also believe three abductions of church workers in march may have been intended to discourage priests from leading protests against rampant violence			0
the three were released unharmed			0
the @entity199 , a church group , reports that eight priests were killed in the past two years in @entity7 — now nine including @entity9 's death — and that two priests remain missing .			1

rev. @entity119 was found dead of a gunshot would to the head in @entity6 state , @entity7
