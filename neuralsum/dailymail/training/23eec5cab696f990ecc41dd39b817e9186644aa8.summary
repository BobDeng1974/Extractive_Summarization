by @entity1 reporter published : 17:26 est , 7 october 2012 updated : 06:13 est , 8 october 2012 @entity2 has called for allegations of sexual abuse against sir @entity5 to be fully investigated			0
the prime minister told the @entity8 's @entity7 show that the claims from a number of women in recent weeks that they had been abused by the former @entity12 were ' truly shocking '			2
and he added that the allegations should be looked into by the @entity8 - which employed @entity5 at the time - and , if necessary , the police			2
call : @entity2 told the @entity8 's @entity7 show yesterday that the allegations against sir @entity5 should be fully investigated a workman in @entity17 ( pictured left ) takes down the sign dedicated to the late @entity5 ( right ) workmen moved in yesterday to remove two clifftop signs for @entity5 's view near the star 's former flat in @entity17 mr @entity2 told the programme : ' i think it is pretty shocking , the allegations that we are reading			1
they need to be properly looked at , properly investigated			0
' it seems to me it is very important that the organisation , the @entity8 , does that itself			0
' but also , if there are questions that should be pursued by the police and other organisations , everyone has to ask themselves the question " is there new evidence that needs to be looked at ? are there new things as an organisation we should look at and examine ? " ' but from what i have read - and that is just as a consumer of the media - truly shocking things have been said			2
' mr @entity2 's call came as a footpath named in honour of @entity54 only last month was stripped of its connection with his tarnished memory yesterday			1
workmen moved in yesterday morning to remove the two cliff - top signs directing visitors to @entity17 seafront along @entity62 ’s view near the disgraced star ’s former flat on the @entity65			1
police kept a close eye on the footpath after the plaque outside @entity5 's former home was vandalised spot the difference : pictured are the before and after views of @entity5 's view in @entity17 police had stepped up patrols around the footpath leading down to the resort ’s @entity76 following a vandal attack on the gold coloured ' bling ' plaque outside @entity5 ’s former home			1
the plaque which was daubed with the words “ rapist ” and “ paedophile ” has also been taken down after @entity5 ’s former neighbours threatened to take a sledgehammer to it			0
security has also been tightened around @entity62 ’s £ 4,000 memorial in the @entity17 cemetery amid fears the grave will be the next target			1
the previously unnamed path that @entity5 used regularly on his jogs around the town was renamed only a couple of weeks ago			0
when the allegations became public , the resort ’s @entity96 set up to honour his name was bullish that the star ’s reputation would ride out the storm			0
disgraced : the commemorative plaque outside @entity5 's flat in @entity17 , was vandalised but growing public anger has forced the committee to back - peddle and a sister project of raising thousands of pounds to create a life sized statue of @entity5 has also been scrapped			1
welcoming the decision to dismantle @entity62 ’s view , @entity17 councillor @entity110 said : ' to keep the signs up would have been an insult to these ladies coming forward with these allegations			1
' whether living or dead the finger should be pointed at someone if they are guilty			0
we just hope the investigation by the @entity123 gets to the bottom of everything			0
