by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 08:52 est , 18 june 2013 updated : 04:11 est , 19 june 2013 anger : @entity4 president @entity3 issued a blunt warning to the @entity6 about the risks of arming @entity9 rebels @entity3 today warned arming rebels in @entity9 would risk a repeat of the ' violent assassination ' murder of @entity6 soldier @entity14 in @entity15			1
the intervention by the @entity4 president to invoke @entity14 's death came after he blocked the @entity19 from calling for the removal of @entity21 to end the bloody conflict in @entity9			1
the @entity4 leader refused to sign a communique at the summit in @entity26 which mentioned ousting the @entity9 president amid claims that chemical weapons have been used against opposition forces			1
at a @entity19 dinner last night @entity31 led seven world powers against one as he tried to shame mr @entity3 into agreeing that @entity9 's brutal regime must be toppled			1
mr @entity31 was hoping for a show of unity over the civil war in @entity9 , which has largely overshadowed the economic priorities of the summit			2
over a dinner of crab and lamb at the @entity25 , the leaders of the @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , and @entity47 joined the @entity6 in urging president @entity3 to give ground			1
but mr @entity3 rejected the idea , and issued a stark warning at a press conference to mark the end of the two - day @entity19 conference			1
in a direct challenge to mr @entity31 , he said : ' recently the @entity6 people suffered a huge loss			2
it was a tragedy next to his barracks on the streets of @entity64			0
a violent assassination , a very brutal killing of a @entity6 serviceman			0
' clearly the opposition is not composed all of this but many of them are exactly the same as the ones who perpetrated the killing in @entity64			0
' if we equip these people , if we arm them what is going to control and verify who is going to have these weapons , including in @entity81 as well			0
' so we call all our partners , before making this dangerous step , think about it very carefully			0
' warning : the @entity4 president told allies to think ' carefully ' before taking any decisions to provide weapons to the opposition forces division : @entity4 president @entity3 has resisted demands from @entity31 and @entity91 to back a call for @entity9 president @entity21 to go the decision to invoke the death of drummer @entity14 in @entity15 is likely to stir emotions in @entity6 other than @entity4 , members of the @entity19 agreed on a five - point plan after two years of civil war in @entity9			1
it included a condemnation of the use of chemical weapons and a declaration that @entity9 needs a ' new government ' with the consent of its people			2
but mr @entity3 has refused to sign up to a demand that @entity21 must go			1
instead the leaders of the world 's most powerful nations papered over their differences on @entity9 to agree a weaker joint position after fraught talks at the @entity25			2
the chief communique states that the @entity19 nations are ' committed to achieving a political solution to the crisis based on a vision for a united , inclusive and democratic @entity9 '			0
it endorses plans to restart peace talks in @entity122 ' as soon as possible ' and says that they should begin with both sides agreeing on ' a transitional governing body with full executive powers , formed by mutual consent '			0
meeting : the two - day summit agreed action on trade , and tax but divisions over @entity9 dominated the agenda talks : @entity6 prime minister @entity31 warned @entity21 has ' blood on his hands ' as @entity19 leaders threw their weight behind calls for a peace conference on @entity9 to be held in @entity122 ' as soon as possible ' protests : @entity143 volunteers dressed as mr @entity31 and mr @entity3 pose for the cameras in a call for an end to global hunger the @entity19 leaders also confirmed that they are making almost $ 1.5 billion available in additional funding for humanitarian operations in @entity9 and its neighbouring countries			1
at a press confernce to mark the end of the summit , mr @entity31 said : ' it is unthinkable that president @entity21 can play any part in the future government of his country			1
' he has blood on his hands , he 's used chemical weapons			0
' mr @entity31 said the priority now was to identify people from the regime and opposition ' who can sit down and talk about a transitional authority that will take power in @entity9 '			2
' if that can happen that opens the way to a genuine transition to a genuine @entity9 free from @entity21 , free from terror			2
that is what we have agreed to work towards and i think that is an important step forward			0
' tense : @entity42 president @entity91 and @entity4 president @entity3 at the @entity25 in @entity26 a cold encounter : mr @entity3 and mr @entity31 clashed during talks in @entity180 on sunday the agreement it comes after mr @entity3 ignored diplomatic protocol to publicly lambast first mr @entity31 and later @entity42 president @entity91 for demanding action to end the war			1
on sunday the @entity4 leader used a press conference in @entity180 to warn mr @entity31 that arming @entity9 's rebels will put guns in the hands of extremists who ' eat the organs ' of their enemies			1
and last night during a @entity19 press conference a visibly uncomfortable mr @entity3 admitted after talks with mr @entity91 that ' our positions do not fully coincide '			2
the @entity198 has indicated it is now ready president @entity91 , who visited a school in @entity202 with mr @entity31 today , is ready to arm the opposition in @entity9			1
instead a joint stance which has been agreed will be formally published this afternoon			0
it will revive hopes that a peace conference can be convened to pave the way for a political transition in the war - torn @entity211 state			0
mr @entity31 put @entity9 top of the agenda at last night 's summit dinner with the aim of restoring momentum towards the proposed meeting in @entity122			1
there had been suggestions that the other seven @entity19 countries could go ahead with a statement with or without @entity4 agreement			0
but @entity4 deputy foreign minister @entity224 announced that a joint deal had been agreed			0
he signalled that it would not specify that @entity21 should step down from power and that no outcome should be declared in advance for how any transitional government wold be made up .			0
