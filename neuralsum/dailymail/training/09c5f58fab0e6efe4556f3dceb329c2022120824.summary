by @entity0 published : 04:50 est , 2 december 2012 updated : 12:29 est , 3 december 2012 they might not be the prettiest of animals but when it comes to friendliness , the hairless @entity4 is the cat ’s whiskers			0
a survey of different types of cat found the pedigree breed to be the most affectionate , whereas @entity14 ’s most common variety – the non-pedigree shorthaired domestic moggy – is the most unfriendly			1
the study , published in the @entity17 , ranked 129 cats from 14 breeds according to geniality			1
pure - breds were found to be the most amiable , with the @entity4 – which sell for around £ 800 – coming top of the list			1
and non-pedigrees were found to be the most likely to ignore their owners , shy away from affection and flee from strangers			0
dr @entity46 , of the @entity47 in @entity48 , where the study was carried out , said : ‘ there is a clear difference in friendliness between the pure - bred cats and the domestic shorthaired			1
in general , the pedigree cats are friendlier than non-pedigree			1
’ it is thought the @entity4 ’s affectionate nature , which even extends to a happiness to visit the vet or be bathed , is due to its reliance on humans to keep warm			1
the survey said pedigrees may also be friendlier because breeders tend to leave kittens with their mothers for longer , during a crucial period in their development when they are becoming used to humans			1
the animals studied ranged from kittens to more than 20 years old			0
they were a mix of males and females , with some neutered and some not			0
the study , which involved 129 cats from 14 breeds , as well as crossbreeds , ranked the felines in order of friendliness 1			2
@entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity90 blues and exotic shorthairs were all ranked fourth 5			0
the domestic shorthair - or the common moggy - scored lowest some lived in homes with other animals and children , while others lived with only their owner			1
the owners were asked a mix of questions , including how their cat would react when they entered a room , how often it would rub up against them , whether it would appear to avoid them , and how it would behave around strangers and vets			0
each cat was then ranked according to friendliness , based on the answers			0
the @entity4 scored an average of 22.83 , compared with 18.93 for the domestic shorthaired			2
because the numbers of other breeds in the survey were generally small , they were grouped together to score an average for pedigrees of 20.40			2
in cases where there were more than a handful of a particular breed , they were found to be friendlier than moggies			2
@entity84 and @entity85 , for instance , scored 20.76 and 20.38 respectively			0
other pedigrees to score highly were @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity90 blues and exotic shorthairs			0
@entity4 cats have become increasingly popular , especially with asthma sufferers because of their lack of fur .			2

the pedigree pets have come out as the most affectionate and friendly in a survey of all types of cats
