by @entity0 published : 06:48 est , 24 december 2012 updated : 09:29 est , 24 december 2012 genetically modified salmon could soon be found on supermarket fish counters after the @entity5 food safety watchdog ruled it posed no environmental risks , it emerged today			2
the @entity7 ( @entity7 ) said it could find no valid scientific reasons to ban production of @entity11 salmon engineered with extra genes from two other fish species			1
if it is now given final approval , the fish will be the first @entity17 animal to hit supermarket shelves anywhere in the world - and in the @entity5 they may not even be labelled as modified			1
growth spurt : the overwhelming size comparison of a genetically modified @entity23 , compared to a non-transgenic @entity11 salmon sibling in the foreground of the same age , are seen the @entity7 has already indicated the @entity23 salmon was safe for human consumption , but published a draft ruling on friday declaring it unlikely to damage the environment			1
their two extra genes make the fish grow twice as fast as normal @entity11 salmon and supporters say it could make land - based fish farms much easier and cheaper to run			1
but opponents of the ' frankenfish ' technology warn it could escape and interbreed with wild fish , undermining the genetics of the already - endangered @entity11 salmon - known as the ' king of fishes '			1
they also argue that commercial production of the salmon could be beginning of concerted efforts to concoct other @entity17 animals for human consumption , raising concerns about animal welfare and human health			1
there are now few hurdles remaining before the @entity17 fish can be lawfully produced and sold in shops in the @entity5 , which could put pressure on the @entity58 and @entity59 to follow suit			1
several government and @entity63 bodies would have to review the technology before it could be approved in the @entity58 , but sucessive government chief scientists have already backed @entity17 as a concept for increasing food production			2
so far , it is only consumer opposition that has blocked the approval of @entity17 foods in the @entity58 , although some products on supermarket shelves already contain @entity17 ingredients and they are regularly found in animal feed			2
restrictions : some of the fish eggs are seen which are born all female and sterile , though @entity79 says a small percentage may still be able to breed aquadvantage salmon are all female , possess three chromosomes instead of the usual two , and grow to market size in 16 to 18 months instead of the usual 30 required for @entity11 salmon			1
@entity85 , the company behind the fish , claim the risk of interbreeding with wild salmon is low because their fish are all sterile and grown in secure containers on land - based fish farms			1
the @entity7 's draft assessment , part of a @entity95 ( @entity95 ) , agrees with the company , ruling that the possibility of the @entity17 salmon escaping into rivers and the sea is ' extremely unlikely ' , @entity92 reported			1
the document concludes that the fish ' will not have any significant impacts on the quality of the human environment of the @entity5 ( including populations of endangered @entity11 salmon ) when produced and grown under the conditions of use for the proposed action			1
' but anti-gm groups have raised concerns about the report			0
@entity113 of pressure group @entity114 told @entity92 : ' the sterility system does not guarantee that there will be no escapes into the wild and some of them will be fully fertile			0
' it 's also debatable whether anyone wants to buy @entity17 salmon , even in the @entity5 , it it is properly labelled			2
' the @entity7 will take comments from the public for 60 days before making the report final			0
the agency said more than two years ago that the fish appears to be safe to eat , but the agency had taken no public action since then			0
executives for @entity134 - based @entity133 speculated that the government was delaying action on their application due to opposition from groups against genetically modified food animals			0
method : the @entity143 salmon , seen growing in their facility 's tanks , has an added growth hormone from the @entity148 salmon that allows the fish to produce growth hormone all year long experts view the release of the environmental report as the final step before approval			0
@entity79 has maintained that the fish is safe and that there are several safeguards against environmental problems			0
the fish would be bred female and sterile , though a very small percentage might still be able to breed			0
the @entity143 salmon has an added growth hormone from the @entity148 salmon that allows the fish to produce growth hormone all year long			0
the engineers were able to keep the hormone active by using another gene from an eel - like fish called an ocean pout that acts like an ' on ' switch for the hormone			0
this means @entity23 salmon grow to market size in 16 to 18 months instead of the usual 30 required for @entity11 salmon , which produce the growth hormone for only part of the year			1
it is still unclear whether the public will have an appetite for the fish if it is approved , however it may not matter since consumers may not even know if they are eating them			0
according to @entity5 guidelines , the fish need not be labelled as genetically modified if the agency decides it has the same material make - up as conventional salmon			1
@entity79 says that genetically modified salmon have the same flavour , texture , colour and odour as the conventional fish , and the @entity7 so far has not shown any signs of disagreeing			2
no change : @entity79 says that genetically modified salmon have the same flavor , texture , color and odor as the conventional fish , and the @entity7 so far has not shown any signs of disagreeing @entity204 , director of the advocacy group @entity205 , said forgoing labelling not only ignores consumers ' rights to know what they are eating , but ' is simply bad for business , as many will avoid purchasing any salmon for fear it is genetically engineered			2
' she urged members of @entity215 to block the impending approval of the fish			0
@entity215 opposition to the engineered fish has so far been led by members of the @entity222 delegation , who see the modified salmon as a threat to the state 's wild salmon industry			2
@entity227 senator @entity226 , for @entity222 , said on friday she is working to convince fellow senators that approval for the fish should be stopped			0
' this is especially troubling as the agency is ignoring the opposition by salmon and fishing groups , as well as more than 300 environmental , consumer and health organisations , ' she said of the preliminary approval .			0

aquadvantage salmon would be the first genetically altered animal approved for human consumption anywhere in the world
they contain two extra genes from other fish that make them grow to full size twice as fast as natural salmon
@entity7 draft ruling declares they are unlikely to damage the environment when grown according to proposed ' conditions of use '
but opponents warn any @entity17 fish that escape and interbreed with wild fish could undermine genetics of already - endangered @entity11 salmon
