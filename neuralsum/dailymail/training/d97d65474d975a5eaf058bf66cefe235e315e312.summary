pressure is mounting on the @entity14 leader amid signs his hopes of breaking away from the rest of the @entity18 will be dashed by voters in next year ’s referendum			1
opponents of independence have set the agenda with a series of interventions , including a warning that @entity11 would not be able to use the pound if it voted to go it alone			2
mr @entity2 and the pro-independence campaign are accused of being ‘ dishonest and disorganised ’ barely 18 months before voters decide on the future of the 300 - year - old @entity31			1
the latest opinion poll shows that 62 per cent of people surveyed think the @entity35 case for independence is either ‘ not very convincing ’ or ‘ not convincing at all ’			1
almost one in four who say they are unimpressed voted for the @entity14 in recent @entity11 and @entity18 parliamentary elections			1
the poll , carried out by @entity41 for @entity43 campaign group which wants to keep @entity11 in the @entity18 , surveyed a total of 1,038 @entity11 adults this week			1
just 11 per cent said the case for independence is ‘ very convincing ' , while 19 per cent said it was ‘ fairly convincing ’			1
better together leader @entity48 said : ‘ whether on @entity49 , @entity50 , currency or pensions , the @entity53 have been exposed as being dishonest and disorganised on their preparations for independence			1
‘ the @entity14 have no answers on basic questions like which currency we would use or who would pay for our pensions			0
their case is falling apart day by day			2
’ chancellor @entity63 last week used a speech in @entity65 to warn an independent @entity11 would end up ' like @entity66 ' with no control over its currency today @entity70 director general @entity69 warned businesses on both sides of the border would suffer if @entity11 broke away from the rest of the @entity18			1
in a speech to the @entity76 , he said : ' our common laws and regulations make it more efficient to operate across the union , not to mention how they lay a strong foundation for us all to enjoy the benefits of our single market			0
we would all lose out if it were fragmented			0
' last week a devastating 118 - page treasury paper sets out the economic realities of independence			2
chancellor @entity63 warned @entity11 could end up ‘ like @entity66 ’ if it gains independence but keeps the pound			0
the chancellor said it was ‘ unlikely ’ the rest of the @entity18 would want to enter a currency union with a separate @entity11			2
in the poll , voters were asked which three issues would be important in deciding how they vote in the referendum , which is to be held on september 18 next year			2

‘ it makes sense for us to have the powers we need to match our priorities and aspirations while maintaining a strong social union with the rest of the @entity18			2
’ but @entity128 msp @entity101 said the poll was a blow for the @entity14			0
she said : ‘ it reaffirms that @entity11 simply do n't trust what they hear from @entity2 and @entity133			0
