by @entity0 published : 04:31 est , 13 march 2013 updated : 05:04 est , 13 march 2013 a waitress turned ball - girl was left hiding her face in embarrassment after she mistakenly disrupted a televised baseball game - by fielding a live ball			1
a video clip of @entity8 picking up the ball and handing it to a young fan in the crowd at the game between @entity13 and @entity14 in @entity15 before realising her gaffe has since been viewed thousands of times on the internet			1
and now customers at the original @entity20 in @entity21 have begun to recognise the embarrassed waitress from the clip			1
embarrassed : waitress @entity8 was left red - faced when she interrupted a televised baseball game by fielding a live ball @entity26 fielded : @entity8 leaps from her pitch - side chair to stop a low struck ball which she does n't realise is still in play video : ooops ! @entity20 girl picks up live baseball the footage shows @entity8 , dressed in trademark @entity20 vest and tiny red shorts , leap from her seat to impressively stop a low struck ball with her glove			1
unwittingly , she picks the ball up and offers it to the crowd , much to the delight of one young fan who gleefully accepts			0
it is only when another fan informs her that the ball was still in play when she stops it and several jeers erupt in the crowd , that she realises she has interrupted the game			0
red - faced @entity8 covers her face with her baseball glove and slinks back to her pitch - side chair			0
she told @entity55 : ' as soon as i saw it coming to me i just got anxious and i scooped it right up and went over there to hand it to him ( a young fan )			0
unaware : not realising that she has stopped a live play , @entity62 picks up the ball and begins to offer it to the crowd boos : @entity8 is still unaware of her error despite several jeers from the @entity15 crowd ' obviously , i did n’t know that it was a fair ball still in play until the fan in front of the little boy informed me			2
” she added : ' i did n’t really know how to react , so , that ’s why i covered my face			0
' miss @entity8 , who works at the original @entity20 in @entity21 , said that customers at the restaurant are now identifying her as the girl from the clip			1
but @entity8 is not the first @entity20 waitress to make such a faux pas - according to the commentators this is the second incident of its kind this spring			1
even @entity13 manager @entity89 complimented the waitress for her fielding skills			2
fortunately for @entity8 , her mistake did n't have too much bearing - the game was merely a practice match			0
realisation : one youngster gleefully accepts the ball from @entity8 as other fans start to tell her that she has interrupted the game @entity100 - faced : @entity8 slinks back to her pitch - side seat and covers her face with her baseball glove after realising what has happened			2
