@entity55 quality : @entity57 's fake henna hand tattoo was inspired by singer @entity51 , pictured here , who has the inking on her right hand works of art : @entity51 's henna tattoos cover her right hand and inspired holidaymaker @entity6 to have a similar design , which left her with permanent scarring ‘ i really like @entity51 ’s tattoo but i ’d never get a permanent one because of my job , ’ says miss street , a consultant for a cruise company			1
‘ so , i decided i ’d treat myself to a henna one just for the holiday instead			1
’ when she saw a local man offering henna tattoos on the beach she decided to go ahead and paid the equivalent of £ 21			1
she picked the decorative hand design echoing @entity51 ’s famous inking , but just five minutes into the treatment her hand began to itch			0

happy holidays ! @entity6 , right , with her friend on holiday in @entity24 , @entity13 , before realising the temporary henna tattoo she got on her left hand would blister and scar ‘ he was still painting the henna on when it started to itch			1
i ’d never had a henna tattoo before so assumed it was normal			2
’ within 30 minutes the design was complete and the henna artist packed up and left , telling miss street to wash the paste off in 45 minutes			2
she followed his instructions but was horrified when , two hours later , white blisters started erupting over her hand			2
she says : ‘ i was desperately trying to wash it off but it was so painful because more blisters were appearing			2
‘ they started oozing pus and i was terrified of infection			0
’ the hotel gave her bandages to wrap the wound but she was unable to enjoy the rest of her holiday as she had to avoid the pool and sunlight to minimise the risk of infection			2
when she returned home she went straight to her gp			0
he told her she had suffered chemical burns thanks to an ingredient in the henna and would be scarred for life			0
‘ i now know it ’s common for street workers to add a hair dye chemical to black henna to make it stronger and that ’s what burns the skin ’ , she says			0
‘ i would have gone to a proper salon if i had known the risks that why i want to share my story			0
‘ the pattern i ’ve been scarred with makes it look like i ’ve got some kind of skin disease			0
they should n’t be able to get away with it			0
