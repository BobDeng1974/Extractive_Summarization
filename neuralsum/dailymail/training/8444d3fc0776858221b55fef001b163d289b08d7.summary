rowdy teens , students and boozed up brits are behind a revolting new craze that encourages people to deliberately defecate in hotel pools while on holiday			1
travel experts say the troubling trend , known as ‘ logging ’ , is responsible for thousands of innocent holidaymakers becoming infected with harmful bacteria that causes diarrhoea and sickness and could result in irritable bowel syndrome and even death in extreme cases			1
the party poopers are purposely ruining holidaymakers ’ getaways without realising or caring about the threat they are posing to fellow guests			1
while it is believed teens or young adults are mostly responsible , children as young as 10 are now believed to be taking part			1
travel law expert @entity47 , of @entity49 solicitors , said the ‘ worrying ’ craze has taken off in the last few years			0
he said : ‘ we have dealt with hundreds of cases where people have been left seriously ill. some idiots think it is humorous to deliberately poo in a crowded pool and then sit back and watch the carnage unfold as people try to escape the pool like a panic scene from the film @entity62			2
’ @entity47 said the ‘ disturbing and selfish trend ’ may seem like harmless fun but it is ruining holidays and posing a serious threat to pool users			1
he said : ‘ we have seen cases where people have had to have their bowels removed due to catching serious infections form people going in the pool			1
’ @entity47 said the law firm has already received more than 20 claims this season from travellers who became ill after being in a hotel pool			2
revolting craze : experts say ' logging ' is exposing innocent holidaymakers to harmful bacteria fouling has become such a problem at a resort in @entity85 that staff at the @entity87 are now threatening guests with eviction and a £ 1,400 fine for pooping in the pool			1
the resort in @entity95 , on the southern tip of the @entity93 , circulated a letter vowing to get to the bottom of what it suspects is a deliberate trend			1
the letter reads : ‘ there have been numerous instances of excrement being found in the pools lately			2
we understand that accidents can happen , but the frequency of this suggests that it no longer remains accidental			0
‘ as a consequence all guests are being massively inconvenienced for several hours during pool closure whilst the hotel adds additional chemicals to the pool and backwash			2
’ the resort is asking guests to be vigilant and report anyone acting suspiciously to staff			2
guests are being told to stay out of the water if they have an upset stomach and put swimming nappies on their babies			0
the dangerous bacteria could result in irritable bowel syndrome and even death in extreme cases problems have also been reported at @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133 resorts that are popular with @entity134			1
pools at @entity136 in @entity137 , @entity136 have been closed up to nine times in the last few weeks due to floating faeces			1
guests are being warned over loudspeakers			0
a spokeswoman for @entity143 , the company that runs the @entity26 resorts , said the incidents are beyond its control			0
she said : ‘ once we have been notified of an incident , hotel staff members ensure that all customers leave the pool immediately and then put the pool water through an extensive filtration system			0
’ dr @entity155 , visiting professor of environmental health at @entity157 and an expert on holiday illnesses , said : ‘ it 's becoming a really serious problem and i have come across it before when investigating illness in hotels			0
' many hotels now have @entity165 to keep an eye on the situation , as it can occur at night when the pool is unguarded			0
‘ this totally unacceptable and selfish behaviour causes a serious health risk and massive inconvenience and expense to tour operators and other holidaymakers			0
what pranksters do n't realise is that in many countries this could be seen as a criminal act , which could have serious consequences that they had n't considered			0
