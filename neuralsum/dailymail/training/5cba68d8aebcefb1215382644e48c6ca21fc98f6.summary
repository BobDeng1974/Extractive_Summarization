princess @entity0 , the former wife of a multi-billionaire @entity2 royal has vowed to fight to win the basic right for women in the kingdom to drive a car , telling @entity7 that it ' can happen overnight '			1
as a princess with a wonderfully privileged life , she is accustomed to being driven from palace to penthouse in chauffeur - driven limousines			0
she used one as a guest of honour at the @entity17 marriage of prince @entity18 and the then @entity19 in 2011 , and regularly socialised with prince @entity20			2
but now a divorcee , @entity0 , 31 , said in an interview that she is currently just as comfortable in her own modest £ 15,000 @entity23 which she drives when she is in @entity25 and @entity26			1
influence : the glamorous princess spoke to @entity7 at the 5th @entity29 in @entity30 last week inspirational : princess @entity0 , right , and queen @entity31 , left , are powerful drivers of change women in her desert kingdom can not enjoy that simple pleasure and she is determined to see them similarly empowered			1
she told @entity7 at the 5th @entity29 in the @entity30 last week : ' it is my job and duty to use my power and influence to highlight these kind of issues and to try to find solutions			1
i am offered platforms to speak around the world , and i must use them to try to change things			0
' women have been barred from driving in @entity2 since the establishment of the state in 1932 and earlier this year , a woman reportedly received 150 lashes after being caught behind the wheel			1
but @entity0 is confident that – with a little bit more pressure – the government will lift the ban shortly			1
she said : ' it will be a hugely important step , and it can happen overnight '			0
protests and acts of defiance against the ban have grown in recent years , with women posting videos of them behind the wheel to social media			1
the latest campaign day was held on october 26			2
the @entity70 ’s annual report on gender rights regularly portrays @entity2 as one of the worst countries for women			2
and the driving ban is a potent symbol of their inferior status			1
every single @entity2 woman has to have a ' male guardian ' , typically their husband or father or brother , who has the same legal power over her as a parent has over a child			0
she requires formal permission for almost all activities , including working , travelling , and sport , and depends on him financially and for housing			0
@entity0 said : ' i do n't believe the ban will go on indefinitely			1
it will be like the decree calling for 20 per cent of @entity96 to be made up of women – a surprising development , but one which happened very rapidly			0
' i believe that it is the generation of young people in @entity2 which is going to accelerate change in the country			0
' among those ' leading the way ' , said @entity0 , is @entity106 , a young royal and governor of the @entity108 who is also a @entity109 phd candidate			1
privilege : princess @entity0 , pictured with her former husband @entity111 at @entity112 and @entity113 of @entity115 's wedding , and right with @entity116 , said : ' it is my job and duty to use my power and influence to highlight these kind of issues and to try to find solutions ' @entity0 said @entity2 women currently have to employ a driver , and that proves impossibly expensive for many			1
it can cost up to £ 340 a month			0
of her own driving experiences , she said : ' we still ca n't officially drive in the cities and towns , but i have driven in the desert many times			1
' ' i have an international license and drive a @entity23 when i am in @entity25 and @entity26			1
i find the gps very helpful , ' @entity0 added			2
' i do not drive in @entity136 or anywhere in the @entity138 , however , because driving on the left is quite confusing			0
' @entity0 said two wheels could be just as good as four too , adding : ' i ride bikes from time to time			2
' but even cycling in @entity2 is a pursuit that is severely restricted for women - they can only do so in so - called ' recreational areas ' , while dressed in full @entity146 body coverings and accompanied by their male guardian			0
an ultraconservative interpretation of @entity146 means women can only use their bikes ' for entertainment ' too , rather than for work or other purposes			0
these are just the type of restrictions which the @entity2 women calling for emancipation want to see lifted			2
there was good news last month when some of those taking part in a closed session of the @entity2 @entity166 's advisory council apparently recommended women over 30 , wearing no make - up , should be allowed to drive between 7am and 8pm			0
an official spokesman for the council denied any policies were agreed , but the claims at least provided encouragement			0
the kingdom is the only country in the world that forbids women from driving , but there has been a positive response to groups of female activists posting pictures and videos of them driving on social media			1
this is all part of a movement which has seen women ‘ taking responsibility for their future ’ using new technology , said @entity0			1
speaking to @entity7 about the remarkable transformation in her life , @entity0 said she was coping well from her split from @entity111 - one of the richest men in the world			1
raised in a middle - class home in @entity108 , @entity0 famously arranged a short interview with prince @entity199 as part of a school journalism project when she was just 18			1
@entity202 : women in @entity2 have begun to use social media to post videos of them driving in protest at the ban			1
there are reports that one woman was given 150 lashes for being caught behind the wheel they were meant to talk for 10 minutes , but got on so well that the conversation lasted for two hours			1
' we just clicked , ' she said of the now 59 - year - old royal , whose vast fortune includes assets such as the legendary @entity220 in @entity221 and @entity222 in @entity223 , and who is known as the ' @entity111 '			1
their marriage , which took place within a year , was very low - key to begin with – it was not even made public until 2009 – but @entity0 was handed the fairytale life of an @entity232 princess			1
but that hit the buffers last year , however , and the hugely glamorous couple divorced early in 2013			2
they remain ' great friends ' , with @entity0 also still describing the @entity199 as ' my mentor '			2
@entity0 , whose divorce settlement as the @entity199 ’s fourth wife remains undisclosed , has thrown herself into work – especially philanthropic causes , and her production company , @entity245			2
she also runs @entity246 in @entity2 , a centre for people who want to volunteer for public service so as to ' make their country a better place , ' said @entity0			2
she is fast becoming one of the most influential @entity232 women in the world , working closely with world figures including queen @entity31 , and former @entity26 secretary of state @entity255			1
activists behind the driving rights movement which started in 2011 are part of a larger protest against state oppression , but @entity0 believes the battle is being won			1
she said : ' @entity2 women are doing incredible things – we 're making progress all the time			0
' she has more than a million followers on social media sites including @entity268 and @entity269 , and sees the web as being hugely important for women to get their message across			0
referring to some 83 per cent of under 25s in the @entity274 and @entity275 who have access to the internet , @entity0 said : ' to be connected is also about being mobile , travelling , working with people globally			2
' she admitted there were too many inconsistencies in @entity2 , where a substantial part of @entity96 is made up of women , but where men and women still have to use different doors to get into buildings			0
' the web gives women equal opportunities , ' she said			0
' women can set up their business online , prosper and be successful , and they can have a voice too through social media			0
' women ’s rights have been improving slowly since @entity297 came to power in august 2005			0
he appointed 30 women to the @entity300 , his advisory council , in a historic breakthrough for @entity2 society			0
this sets the stage for 2015 , when a new decree not only allows women to vote in municipal elections for the first time , but they will be able to run for local government office too			0
hopes : @entity0 said : ' @entity2 women are doing incredible things – we 're making progress all the time ' friends in high places : the princess kisses @entity319			1
@entity0 has been praised by leaders around the world for her efforts in promoting equal rights in @entity2 and the @entity274 ambitious economic plans have also seen increases in the number of women finding employment in the private sector and going to university			1
more generally , @entity2 women are being recognised as major public figures , rather than individuals who have to stay in the background			0
one of @entity335 ’s proudest moments came in 2011 , when , in the same year as prince @entity18 ’s wedding , she received the 800th @entity338 from prince @entity339			2
she said : ' it was truly amazing to receive such an award from the @entity199			0
i really appreciated it coming from a person who has so much experience of life			0
it was such an honour to speak to him			0
' both the @entity349 and the @entity138 public are renowned for their generosity and good works			0
' @entity319 , the only daughter of @entity354 and @entity255 , has said : ' @entity0 's advocacy on behalf of @entity2 women has provided a tremendous contribution to how we think about the rights of girls and women around the world			1
' @entity0 said her own motto in life is : ' throw yourself over the edge that you 're always scared of			2
try being independent ; do it your way			0

@entity0 , 31 , who divorced £ 20bn prince @entity111 last year spoke to @entity7 about her campaign to emancipate women
hopes ban will be lifted in very near future ' with a little bit more pressure '
