signing off : @entity0 has cancelled two stops on her book tour this week amid allegations she sexually abused her little sister			1
pictured above at a book event in @entity6 on october 29 @entity0 is reportedly threatening to sue the right - wing website which last week accused her of sexually abusing her little sister @entity8 when they were children			1
in the wake of the allegations , the creator and star of @entity13 's girls , has cancelled two stops on her book tour scheduled this week in @entity17 and @entity18 for health issues			1
on monday , she tweeted that she was ' deeply sorry ' to miss the @entity20 and a signing in @entity22 , adding that she 's ' so grateful for your energy and support '			0
last week , right - wing website @entity26 excerpted a portion from @entity0 's new book about her childhood curiosity with the female reproductive system and labelled it ' unsettling ' and ' disturbing '			1
today , that website claims that @entity0 is threatening to sue them if they do n't remove the article she claims is ' false and defamatory ' and publish an apology note			1
the website adamantly declined , and editor @entity38 wrote another article explaining why they would not heed to the demands of @entity0 's lawyers			2
we refuse to withdraw our story or apologize for running it , because quoting a woman ’s book does not constitute a “ false ” story , even if she is a prominent actress and left - wing activist			2
' @entity0 may not like our interpretation of her book , but unfortunately for her and her attorneys , she wrote that book – and the @entity55 covers a good deal of material she may not like , the article reads			2
the passage that @entity26 excerpted details a conversation that then - year - old @entity0 had with her mother , famed artist @entity62 , about women 's organs			1
in the course of the conversation , young @entity0 asks her mother if little sister @entity8 's vagina looks like hers			1
the essay descirbes a curious 7 - year - old @entity0 looking at her then 1 - year - old sister @entity8 ( left ) vagina after having a conversation with her mother about female reproductive organs			1
the @entity0 sisters pictured above at the filming of @entity0 's film @entity91 in november 2010 ' @entity8 was sitting up , babbling and smiling , and i leaned down between her legs and carefully spread open her vagina			2
she did n’t resist and when i saw what was inside i shrieked			0
' my mother came running			0
“ mama , @entity97 ! @entity8 has something in there ! ” ' my mother did n’t bother asking why i had opened @entity8 ’s vagina			0
this was within the spectrum of things i did			0
' she just on her knees and looked for herself			0
it quickly became apparent that @entity8 had stuffed six or seven pebbles in there			0
my mother removed them patiently while @entity8 cackled , thrilled that her prank had been a success			0
' @entity26 responded described the essay as ' unsettling ' and ' disturbing ' in an article titled ' @entity0 describes sexually abusing her little sister ' the article reads : ' @entity0 describes experimenting sexually with her younger sister @entity8 , whom she says she attempted to persuade to kiss her using “ anything a sexual predator might do			1
” in one particularly unsettling passage , @entity0 experimented with her six - year younger sister ’s vagina			2
' they also originally wrote that @entity0 was 17 at the time of the incident , and later added a correction saying ' this article has been modified to correct a typo in the book excerpt incorrectly listing @entity0 's age as seventeen '			1
obviously upset with being named as a child molester , @entity0 took to @entity132 on saturday to lash out at @entity26 for their damaging article three days after it was published			1
the website has refused to apologize for the article			2
' if ms. @entity0 says that our quotations from her book were “ false , ” or that our interpretation of those events was libelous under the law , then we look forward to asking her , in her deposition , about why they appeared in her book , ' editor @entity38 wrote on tuesday			1
' we also look forward to asking her why she believes it is now appropriate for a 28 - year - old woman to make light of opening her baby sister ’s vagina , paying her with candies for prolonged kisses on the lips in the manner of a “ sexual predator , ” or masturbating in bed next to her prepubescent sister , ' he added			0
@entity158 also appears to have responded to the allegations in her own @entity132 rant on monday , writing vaguely about heternormativity and what is and is not considered ' normal ' behavior			1
@entity8 writes that she supports writers ' narrating their own experiences , determining for themselves what has and has not been harmful '			0
she also posted : ' 2day , like every other day , is a good day to think about how we police the sexualities of young women , queer , and trans people			0
' while the tweets seem to address the criticism of her sister 's essay , they do not directly come out and support the personal story that her sister shared with the world			0
the sisters appear to have a difference of opinion on the @entity26 article , according to one tweet @entity0 wrote on saturday			1
' sometimes i get so mad i burn write up			0
also , i wish my sister was n't laughing so hard , ' @entity0 tweeted on november 1			2
in defense : @entity158 ( left ) came out to respond to claims her older sister sexually abused her when they were children			0
