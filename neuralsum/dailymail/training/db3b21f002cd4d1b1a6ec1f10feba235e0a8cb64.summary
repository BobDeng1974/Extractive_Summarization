the government wants to split its £ 10billion tax collecting it system into 100 separate parts			1
but @entity19 fear the ‘ @entity25 ’ system – which collects £ 500billion of income tax every year , while also processing millions of tax returns , child benefit payments and tax credits – is too important to fiddle with			1
the giant it contract , run by the technology company @entity27 for @entity28 , has already spiralled out of control with costs almost trebling in ten years , according to the @entity32 newspaper			1
but @entity19 are concerned that the plan to split the contract into 100 smaller packages in 2017 could result in chaos			1

the potential for another disaster is huge			0
’ mr @entity40 added : ‘ i am a great believer in getting smaller companies in , but if you split the project up into 100 pieces , you need 500 skilled people to manage it			2
you can not afford to get this wrong			0
’ @entity62 , director of research at the @entity64 , a think - tank , said there was ‘ a big risk that the department may find it all too difficult ’			0

@entity2 , chairman of the public administration select committee , said : ‘ it would be a mistake to run before you can walk			0
‘ and unless there are people in @entity28 with the necessary skills in managing a number of smaller contracts then you will be jumping out of the frying pan into the fire			1
’ but the government insisted the new contracts would improve the system			0
