thirty years after the @entity1 fire which killed 56 football supporters , a new book written by a survivor of the disaster claims it was not an accident			1
author @entity8 points the finger at the @entity10 , @entity1 's chairman at the time and a businessman who had been linked to eight previous blazes			1
' could any man really be as unlucky as @entity16 ? ' writes @entity8 , after 15 years spent researching the fire in which four members of his family died			1
the fire at @entity1 's @entity22 claimed 56 victims and injured 265 on may 11 , 1985 the 30th anniversary is approaching since the tragic fire that killed 56 people at @entity1 's ground in 1985 fire engulfs @entity22 on a day nobody can ever forget as 56 were killed at the football stadium a police officer uses his helmet to shield the heat from his face as he runs in front of the stand on fire then - @entity1 chairman @entity16 ( left ) with mr @entity38 in front of the burned stand 1 : may 1967 : fire in @entity16 's factory at @entity42 2 : april 1968 : fire at @entity45 , managing director is @entity16 3 : august 1970 : store - room explosion at @entity47 , founded by @entity16 4 : dec 1971 : tenant fire at @entity49 , @entity50 , owned by @entity16 5 : august 1977 : fire at @entity52 , in @entity16 - owned @entity54 building 6 : dec 1977 : fire at @entity57 factory			1
coronet a subsidiary of @entity59 , owned by @entity16 7 : nov 1977 : fire with toxic fumes at his @entity54 factory 8 : june 1981 : fire in a plastics factory at @entity54 his brother @entity65 , 11 , his father @entity66 , 34 , his uncle @entity67 , 32 , and his grandfather @entity68 , 63 , were among the 54 @entity1 supporters and two @entity71 supporters who did not survive			1
@entity8 , who was 12 at the time became determined to challenge the accepted theories which he believes were founded upon a flawed investigation			2
he discovered that @entity16 , who died in 1995 at the age of 61 , had been connected to at least eight other fires at business premises and insurance claims dating back to 1967			1
his findings have been published in @entity80 – the story of the @entity82 , which is being serialised in @entity83			1
it stops short of a direct accusation of arson but inferences are clear and he is certain more should have been done at the time to investigate the disaster and those responsible			2
he hopes these questions can be officially addressed and that his research will prompt a new investigation into the disaster as the 30th anniversary approaches next month			2
no - one has sought accountability for the fire since the official inquiry chaired by high court judge @entity101 recorded its findings following five days of hearings held less than a month after the blaze			2
the inquiry found that a small fire was probably caused by a spark from a discarded cigarette or match dropped through a gap in the wooden frame of the main stand on to piles of rubbish which had been collecting for years			0
it was the final game of the season and should have been a day of celebration			0
before kick - off @entity1 were presented before with the trophy for winning the @entity121 title			1
the fire was noticed towards the end of the first half and within four minutes the stand packed with 4,000 spectators was fully ablaze			0
there were no fire extinguishers and no designated fire escapes			0
a 12 - year - old @entity8 is comforted by his mother @entity130 in 1985 after the @entity82 disaster one survivor looks distraught with his burns visible ( left ) while another sits in front of a burned out stand prime minister @entity137 visits the scene of the disaster with her husband @entity140 in 1985 tributes paid to the 56 who were killed by the fire on the same day @entity1 should have been celebrating his many businesses included toy company @entity59			1
he once described football as ' the opera of the people '			0
after an initial spell as @entity1 chairman , he came back in 1983 when he and another local businessman , @entity151 , saved @entity1 from the receivers , buying the club for around £ 30,000 each			1
@entity16 resigned as chairman in 1988 due to ill health			1
he died on april 21 1995 after a heart transplant			0
the tragedy , followed by @entity158 , less than three weeks later , and @entity159 in 1989 , accelerated safety changes in football ground			0
the community turned inwards to comfort each other			0
they raised money for the @entity166 at @entity167 and supported friends through the aftermath of loss , physical pain and the psychological problems			0
they were not inspired by the need to fight and clear their names like the families of those killed at @entity159			0
as a whole they accepted it was a terrible accident and nothing came from the media or the courts to change that view			0
@entity1 reacted to early criticism that it had failed to honour the tragedy and there are memorials in the city centre and at the stadium and an annual memorial service , attended mostly by a few hundred of the people most closely affected			1
in 2010 , on the 25th anniversary , there were an estimated two thousand at the service in the city 's @entity197 but this year there has been such a surge of interest that the club considered moving it to @entity22			1
times have changed and social media has fuelled a craving for public outpourings of sympathy			0
@entity209 's authorities decided that this year there would be a minute 's silence before all games on april 25 , when @entity1 play @entity213 at @entity22			1
it is the final game of the season and @entity1 always remember the victims of the fire at the home game closest to the anniversary			2
representatives from @entity1 and @entity71 have also been invited to @entity221 for the @entity223 semi-finals this weekend and the @entity223 will be represented at the annual memorial service in @entity1 on may 11			2
these are specific to the 30th anniversary and yet are in tune with a general increase in attention which has coincided with an upturn in the club 's fortunes			0
but it sits uneasily with many at @entity22			2
then - @entity1 chairman @entity16 ( left ) outside @entity22 , where 56 people died and 265 were injured the remains of the stand at @entity1 's ground after the disaster on saturday may 11 , 1985 at @entity22 investigators look around the burned out stand at @entity1 's ground following the tragedy in 1985 the charred remains of a @entity1 programme from the day of the fire in which 56 people were killed author @entity8 writes about his own experience at the @entity246 , and asks why chairman @entity16 was not investigated : ' why was it left to the 12 - year - old who lost three generations and four members of his family , who was with over 40 people when they died within a 10 - yard radius of him , who somehow got out of the stand , as the last person to get out , the only person to get out the front after being at the back , and the only person to survive the smoke ? ' many supporters were unsure about a memorial flag which was taken to @entity221 when @entity1 reached the @entity265 final two years ago			1
@entity267 and @entity268 fans then applauded in the 56th minute of last year 's @entity223 final , a well - intentioned mark of solidarity copied by @entity273 fans at @entity22 , this season			1
others have turned up and started to sing ' stand up for the 56 '			0
again , this has provoked a mixed response			0
some @entity1 supporters believe the victims should be remembered in this way , others prefer it to keep it private			2
a stage documentary called the 56 is touring local theatres and children 's entertainers the @entity287 have launched a charity single with members of @entity290			0
another fan has been selling old seats numbered 1 - 56 which were reclaimed from the stand this year while ' 56 ' branded hoodies and t - shirts are on sale , some more tasteful than others			0
profits from some of these ventures will go to the @entity301 and @entity302 ( @entity303 ) at the @entity304 , set up by professor @entity305 after the fire			0
in another year of success for @entity1 , with @entity223 wins against @entity309 and @entity310 , the club has found the dynamic is altering around what was once called football 's less remembered tragedy			2
it may never be the same again after @entity8 's book			1
he started his own investigations in 1994 , when his mother told him @entity22 had not been @entity16 's first fire			1
the more he unearthed , the more his mind was made up			0
his findings will disturb the peace in @entity1 .			2

fifty - six people were killed and 265 were injured on may 11 , 1985 , when the @entity1 fire disaster *occurred* at @entity22
@entity8 's mother , @entity130 , told her son about the disaster on may 11 , 1994 , that killed her other son , husband , brother - in - law and father - in - law
then - @entity1 chairman @entity16 was linked to at least eight other fires before the disaster at @entity22
@entity8 is releasing his book , ' @entity80 - @entity338 of the @entity82 '
