it was a performance that offered a tantalising glimpse of what @entity2 might achieve this season and proved why @entity5 wanted to sign him			1
but as @entity8 walked off the pitch at @entity10 on monday night , having been involved in all three goals to cap a debut of which he could be proud , i could n’t help think of one question — will he ever really be loved at @entity16 ? do not underestimate the impact @entity8 could have in the coming months			2
he is a midfielder capable of producing moments of magic and his intricate passing and link play might be the difference in propelling @entity2 to their first @entity24 title since 2010			1
but @entity2 supporters knew what they were getting too — a former @entity52 player , who irritated them when he clashed with @entity35			1
they might well respect his quality but will they afford him the same devotion that they have for @entity56 or @entity57 ? i would say that will be difficult			0
and what do @entity52 fans now think of him ? when i played against @entity8 , i viewed him as one of the few young players who had the mental strength and ability to run a game			1
it spoke volumes that @entity70 was prepared to give him such an important role so early in his career			0
he enjoyed some good times , winning the @entity74 , playing in a @entity76 final and captaining the side , but there wo n’t be any warm reception when @entity8 is reacquainted with @entity52 for the first time at @entity16 on october 5			1
i can understand why some players make certain moves — to be fair to @entity8 , he did n’t have many top options this summer and @entity52 did n’t want him back — but , equally , i ca n’t understand why some jeopardise something they have worked hard to build up for a couple of years with the enemy			1
look at the example of @entity89			0
he should be idolised on @entity90 after the goals he scored for @entity92 , but his subsequent spell with @entity94 means he will never be afforded the same affection as @entity96 or @entity97			2
united fans are just as indifferent to him			2
similarly , @entity99 helped @entity94 win their first double in 1993 - 94 , but three years later he was being unveiled at @entity101			2
you ca n’t be loved by two sides who have a mutual dislike for each other and @entity99 , who was a tremendous midfielder , is now simply viewed with scepticism by both fan - bases			0
sometimes players make decisions without considering the long - term impact			0
@entity97 , by contrast , took a different view			0
he would have lifted the title a few times had he joined @entity2 but he chose to stay at @entity92 because he knew any medals he would win would mean more			1
aside from that , he guaranteed , in my eyes , that he had a relationship with the club that went beyond medals			0
that is something @entity126 will find out for himself during the next few years at @entity94 , where he has won almost all there is to win			0
rival move : @entity89 leaves the @entity101 pitch after playing against @entity92 for @entity94 unveiling : former @entity94 player @entity99 poses for the media after joining @entity92 in 1997 old club : @entity8 celebrates after helping @entity52 beat @entity2 1 - 0 at the @entity132 in 2007 if @entity94 continue to experience difficulties , whether not winning trophies or not being in the @entity76 , rather than looking to move on , @entity126 would get more respect if he pulled them back to the top and lifted a trophy than if he won two or three elsewhere			1
we all wonder what it is like at different clubs but i wanted to be a one club man			0
i loved what @entity145 and @entity146 accomplished with @entity148 , i have tremendous respect for @entity150 , @entity151 and @entity152 with @entity94			0
i wanted to be seen in the same light			0
lots of players , though , would prefer to be more successful , earn more money and have different life experiences			0
i totally accept that , but i think there are certain decisions you have to take that , while they do n’t benefit you in the short - term , in the long run it proves to be the right choice			2
commitment : @entity168 legend @entity145 spent his entire career at @entity148 before retiring in 2009 farewell : @entity151 salutes the @entity171 crowd after playing his last game for @entity94 in may that ’s why i could never work out why @entity174 left @entity175 for @entity52 or the way @entity177 did the same to @entity52 when he joined @entity2 ; they both came through the ranks at big clubs but went on to enjoy great success at their bitter rivals			1
but could they not have enjoyed similar success , at home or abroad , at a club that would not have caused such acrimony ? neither of those players can go back to where it started for them and , if i ’m honest , i also find it strange that @entity35 has joined @entity193 for six months , even though some @entity2 fans have said they do n’t begrudge him the move			1
controversial : defender @entity174 left @entity175 for @entity198 rivals @entity52 in 2001 heading west : left - back @entity177 ( right ) left @entity52 in 2006 to join @entity198 rivals @entity2 it all boils down to what order you put medals , money or respect in			1
everyone is different but , at the end of your career , it is nice to know you have the affection of the fans whose club you served the longest			0
by swapping red and white for blue , @entity8 may have given that up — and it remains to be seen if @entity2 followers will love him too			1
hugs all round : @entity8 congratulates @entity217 ( left ) on scoring @entity2 's third goal against @entity29 @entity219 treat for defender like me ... this week i ’m looking forward to watching the two outstanding young @entity223 defenders go head - to - head			1
i will be at @entity219 on saturday evening and one aspect of the game i ’m relishing is how @entity52 defender @entity227 and @entity229 ’s @entity228 perform in a fascinating encounter			1
though the season is only two weeks old , @entity231 has been @entity52 ’s outstanding player			1
he built on the promise of his first two performances with a commanding display against @entity237 in the @entity76 on tuesday			0
chambers might only be 19 , but he was n’t ruffled by the hostile atmosphere in @entity240 and that experience will stand him in good stead for what awaits him on @entity244			0
@entity229 play good football under @entity246 and @entity219 remains an intimidating ground			2
future star : @entity227 produced a commanding display against @entity237 in the @entity76 when @entity52 lost 3 - 0 to @entity229 in april , @entity250 bullied @entity70 ’s defenders and with the @entity253 forward fit for the match , @entity231 can be certain that he will be in for a difficult 90 minutes			1
it will be interesting to see how he copes			0
as for @entity256 , i was impressed with his debut season in the @entity24			2
he had to play at right - back against @entity261 last week , due to @entity263 ’s hamstring injury			0
@entity229 were shrewd to tie @entity256 , 20 , down to a long - term contract this summer and if he and @entity231 maintain their progression , then they could become @entity268 ’s first - choice defensive pairing in the future			1
one to watch : @entity229 's @entity228 has signed a long - term contract with the @entity244 club mario a bargain , if he does n't harm team spirit so @entity274 is on the brink of joining @entity92 and completing the shock move of the summer			1
when i first saw the news breaking , my initial reaction was ‘ this ca n’t be true ’ ; i had serious misgivings			0
since then , though , i have changed my stance because of the economics — £ 16million for a 24 - year - old who is @entity286 ’s @entity285 striker looks a great deal			1
if you consider @entity290 moved from @entity291 to @entity292 for £ 11m , it is even better value			0
and if @entity274 fails to deliver , @entity92 could expect to recoup most of their outlay			1
i admit he still has to convince me as a player			0
people talk about his behaviour off the pitch — that does n’t worry me too much and , in truth , i think some of it is quite funny			0
in town : @entity274 arrives at @entity92 's @entity304 training ground ahead of his medical on friday it is what happens when he crosses that white line that is important , and he has yet to show me he is as good as some people have claimed			1
we faced each other a few times when he was in @entity268 and i never saw a lot from him at @entity101			2
he was subbed in his three appearances there and sent off after 18 minutes as a substitute			0
there is , however , a player lurking in that frame			0
he has been outstanding on the two occasions he faced @entity268 at major tournaments , causing problems with his pace and power			2
if he ’s like that , @entity92 will have done some smart business			2
@entity327 will find three games a week difficult , so there will be rotation issues and how they play as a pair will be intriguing			0
above all , @entity92 have a fabulous spirit under @entity333 that has carried them far			2
@entity274 ca n’t be allowed to jeopardise that			1
sending out a message : @entity274 ( left ) and @entity336 wear ' i love @entity339 ' t - shirts in 2011			1

@entity2 are looking to win their first @entity24 title since 2010
@entity8 is a top - class operator with a proven pedigree on the biggest stage
the former @entity52 player irritated @entity2 fans when he clashed with @entity35 in 2007
it remains to be seen whether @entity352 fans will come to love @entity31
@entity227 has been @entity52 's outstanding player so far
@entity231 and @entity229 's @entity228 could become @entity268 's first - choice defensive pairing in the future
@entity92 *buying* striker @entity274 for £ 16m looks a great deal
the @entity168 can not be allowed to jeopardise @entity92 's team spirit
