by @entity0 and @entity1 all women over the age of 20 should take a daily dose of @entity5 to reduce their chances of developing breast cancer , an expert claims			1
professor @entity9 is writing to health secretary @entity10 to argue that making the ‘ sunshine vitamin ’ free on the @entity12 would save 1,000 lives a year			1
he has already started handing out the pills to female patients at his private clinic			1
but he believes all women should get them – even those who have not been diagnosed with the disease			1
professor @entity9 is recommending that all women aged 20 or over be given @entity5 supplements whether they have signs of breast cancer or not prof @entity9 said the measure would cost the @entity12 just 12p per woman per day – and claims it would spare thousands the agony of developing the condition			1
‘ i am calling for all women from the age of 20 to be given free @entity5 supplements on the @entity12 because it is effective in protecting against breast cancer , ’ he said			1
‘ it is established science that women who have higher @entity5 levels have a better chance of beating the disease			1
‘ studies also show that women with higher @entity5 levels are significantly less likely to develop breast cancer in the first place			1
’ every year 50,000 women in @entity43 are diagnosed with breast cancer , and the disease claims almost 12,000 lives annually			1
prof @entity9 , a surgeon at the private @entity47 , said : ‘ my estimate is that at least 1,000 lives could be saved by supplementation a year			1
’ @entity5 is best known for its role in helping build and maintain healthy bones			0
but scientists have discovered it is also essential for the immune system and regulating how cells divide			0
both are key to fighting cancer			1
according to the @entity61 in the @entity62 , ‘ being “ d - ficient ’ ’ may increase the risk of a host of chronic diseases – including osteoporosis , heart disease , some cancers and multiple sclerosis – and infectious diseases , such as tuberculosis and even seasonal flu ’			1
prof @entity9 said his tests showed that half his private patients were @entity5 deficient , and a third were severely deficient			1
prof @entity9 says that 1,000 women could be saved every year if the 12p a day vitamin was provided on the @entity12 ‘ i give @entity5 to all my women patients at the clinic because the higher the levels , then the greater the protection from breast cancer , ’ he added			1
‘ @entity5 works by encouraging cancer cells to change to normal cells , and it also enhances the immune system			0
another benefit is that it promotes the death of breast - cancer cells			0
’ evidence that @entity5 supplements may combat breast cancer has been building			2
in 2008 , a @entity93 study showed breast cancer patients with good @entity5 levels were about half as likely to die from the disease as those with a serious deficiency			2
@entity100 and @entity101 studies have reached similar conclusions			2
however , @entity103 , of @entity104 , disagrees with prof @entity9 ’s analysis			1
she said : ‘ there have been a large number of studies about @entity5 and breast cancer and it looks as if people ’s @entity5 levels do n’t affect breast cancer risk			2
trials in which people took @entity5 supplements have shown no effect			2
’ prof @entity9 , who is also an honorary consultant surgeon at @entity118 in @entity119 , compared the situation to the evidence on smoking and claimed action was needed now			1
he said : ‘ this is a low - cost , cheap intervention and there ’s no toxicity from taking it			2
’ however , @entity12 chiefs remain worried about the cost			2
@entity12 spending on @entity5 supplements now tops £ 100 million a year , up from £ 28 million in 2004			1
the @entity132 and @entity133 were asked to comment but failed to respond			0
@entity5 may be known for protecting the elderly against osteoporosis – but it is also putting a spring in the step of some of the country ’s fittest dancers			0
scientists have discovered that ballet stars can jump more than an inch – 3cm – higher after a few months of taking the pills daily			2
supplements also increase leg strength by a fifth and cut the chance of injury , according to a study of members of the @entity152			2
@entity152 ( pictured ) took part in a study which showed that dancers could jump 3cm higher and had increased leg strength after taking the supplements for a few months @entity159 dr @entity158 , from the city ’s @entity160 , said : ‘ we suspected muscle strength would improve but the results were impressive			0
’ the dancers took a pill containing 2,000 international units of @entity5 every day for four months last winter			0
every year 50,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer and 12,000 people die from it the dosage is ten times the @entity173 recommended daily amount , but in dr @entity158 ’s opinion it is still ‘ quite a low level of supplementation ’			1
he and his colleagues measured how high the dancers could jump at the start and the end of the trial – and how hard they could push with their legs			0
they also recorded how many injuries they had which forced them to stop training for at least a day			0
dancers given the pills went from jumping 17in ( 43cm ) off the floor to 18in ( 46cm ) , while their leg strength increased by 19 per cent			0
the leg strength of those not given the pills remained the same , according to results published in @entity198			0
and their jump height decreased slightly			0
those not given the pills also had a higher chance of being injured – 50 per cent compared with less than 30 per cent for those on @entity5 sports nutritionist dr @entity205 said footballers , rugby players , jockeys and golfers were also using @entity5 to boost performance			0
‘ if you think how hectic the winter period can be in a lot of sports , it ’s really important , ’ he added			0
@entity5 is produced by the skin when exposed to strong sunlight			0
everyone needs 15 minutes ’ daily exposure to maintain healthy levels			0
oily fish and eggs are also good sources , especially in winter when the body ’s levels are low .			0

professor @entity9 thinks 1,000 lives a year could be saved
he is handing the supplements to women at his clinic in @entity119
the pills would cost the @entity234 per woman per day
studies show vitamin is effective at fighting and *preventing* the disease
