fbi director @entity0 says he 's confident that @entity1 was behind the cyberattack on @entity3			1
@entity0 said wednesday that threats made against @entity3 were traced to ip addresses used exclusively by the @entity1 , at a cybersecurity conference at @entity8 's @entity7			1
@entity0 also said there was evidence that @entity1 had sought to use proxy servers to conceal the @entity3 hack but they sometimes ' got sloppy ' and did n't use the servers - and that they would strike again			1
these claims just raise more questions however for one cyber expert , @entity19			1
in nearly every case they would use proxy servers in sending those emails and posting those statements , ' said @entity0			2
' but several times they got sloppy			0
several times , either because they forgot or they had a technical problem , they connected directly and we could see it			0
' he also added ; ' we could see that the ip addresses they used ... were ips that were exclusively used by the @entity1			1
it was a mistake by them			0
it was a very clear indication of who was doing this			0
they would shut it off very quickly once they realized the mistake , but not before we saw them and knew where it was coming from			0
' working as both the director of security operations for @entity59 , the world â€™s largest hacker conference , and the principal security researcher for global @entity63 and @entity65 provider @entity64 , @entity19 may be one of the foremost experts when it comes to hacking			2
' it is certainly interesting stuff and adds a bit more color to the attack , but nothing he said conclusively ties it to the @entity1 , ' said @entity19			2
' for example when he says ip addresses exclusively used by @entity1 , what does he actually mean ? ' he asks			1
' when he says emails and messages , what messages and how does he know they were n't fake or bounced off of other servers to hide their origin ? ' he then went on to say , ' how do we even know the emails that look like a slip - up were even sent by the attackers ? anyone could have sent them pretending to be @entity28			0
' @entity19 had previously voiced his problems with the @entity25 's claims against @entity1 back in december in a piece her wrote for @entity92			1
the first @entity25 claim that @entity19 tore down also happened to be one the strongest that the @entity25 had , saying in their statement ; ' the malware used in this attack revealed links to other malware that the @entity25 knows @entity1 actors previously developed			2
' there were two problems with this according to @entity19 , and both had to do with the bureau basing their findings on assumptions as opposed to fact			0
first , while a similar malware may have been used in a previous cyber attack that @entity1 has been linked to , that does not serve as definitive proof that this attack was carried out by @entity1			1
@entity19 then further chipped away at their statement , pointing out that he and many security experts do not believe @entity1 was involved in those previous incidents , whose coding the @entity25 is referencing to tie the attacks together			2
what 's more , the coding for one of the two malwares , @entity119 , was leaked according to @entity19 , and would not be difficult for any hacker to find			0
he then took aim at the @entity25 conclusion that since the ip addresses used in the attack are addresses used by @entity1 in previous attacks , they must be responsible			1
according to @entity19 , the reasoning is flawed as these addresses are used by everyone from major hackers to even small time @entity132 criminals to avoid detection , meaning these addresses could tie virtually anyone in the hacking community , or even someone using stolen credit cards to shop online and avoid detection , to the attack			0
then , there is the fact that the demand by the hacking group , who call themselves the @entity28 , that the @entity27 not be released was not announced until weeks into the hack , and only after some members of the media had begun to perpetuate the now widely accepted story that the goal of the hack was to make sure @entity27 would never be distributed by @entity3			1
@entity19 pointed all this out again on wednesday after seeing the new @entity25 claims , saying ; ' we have already seen the @entity25 send out a flash alert to media organizations based on one spoof			0

fbi director @entity0 said in a speech wednesday that he 's confident that @entity1 was behind the cyberattack on @entity3
he said the threats made against @entity3 were traced to ip addresses that were used exclusively by @entity1
a cyber expert in hacking however says that none of this provides definitive proof of @entity1 involvement
@entity0 said of his *critics* , ' they do n't see what i see '
