he went in search of eight - legged friends in his native country and his photos reveal them in a way they are rarely seen , with every single bristle on their legs in crystal - sharp focus			1
if you look closely enough , you can even see @entity22 's lens reflected in their gleaming eyes			2
@entity22 's other photographs include ladybirds , moths and beetles , and he has also captured the gruesome ruthlessness of the natural world as insects devour each other alive			0

eyes see you ! @entity11 photographer @entity34 has captured these incredible photos of spiders in his native country - which are sure to give you the willies @entity39 : some of the spiders are illuminated so brightly it looks as though they have been painted in false colours or are lit from within spindly : we are used to seeing arachnids scuttling under the couch as little more than a dark blur , but @entity34 's photos reveal a side to them which we rarely see bristles : although spiders have multiple pairs of eyes , much of their ' vision ' comes from sensitive hairs which pick up even the slightest vibration in their environment surreal : many of the species are highly unusual , with translucent skin and pointy protrusions on top of their eyes @entity68 : the spiders call to mind the giant evil beasts of @entity71 or @entity72 - but most of them are completely harmless , despite their looks hey beautiful : some of the spiders , captured on a @entity78 camera by @entity34 , look a little like giant robots or alien fighting machines fluttering : this spider is sitting pretty on a leaf with what , bizarrely , look like false eyelashes			1
@entity86 ' hairs are highly sensitive and act as their second sight just sitting in my hole : the spiders shot in their natural environment look very much like they 've been caught in the headlights - with mr @entity34 reflected in their glassy eyes camouflage : this species blends in with the spines on a leaf almost perfectly			2
even its eyes are practically the same shade of green gorgeous : eight - legged creatures are not always regarded as the most beautiful in the animal kingdom , but they serve a vital function in the natural order put your hands in the air : the photographer 's skill is evident as his images almost look like they have been posed for by his eight - legged models hiding out : 35,000 spider species have been listed worldwide , but only a handful are considered dangerous and 27 are known to have killed humans			0
