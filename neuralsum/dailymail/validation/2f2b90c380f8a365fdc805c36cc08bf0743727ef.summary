inmates at a state prison in @entity2 have were allegedly stripped naked , sprayed with toxic chemicals , and had their beds taken away for little or no reason as part of a brutal disciplinary regime			1
prisoners at the @entity9 , near @entity10 , were reportedly beaten and even threatened with having their fingers broken while other guards manipulated surveillance cameras to perpetuate the harsh system which they called ' the program '			1
according to allegations from prisoners and former guards , the perpetrators and their superiors engineered a conspiracy of silence around the shocking practices , which meant that any concerns raised were swept away			2
' brutality ' : @entity26 to the harsh allegations is corrections officer captain @entity27 , left , who was reportedly a prolific user of chemicals on inmates			0
@entity30 , right , was an asthmatic prison who died after he had pepper spray used on him meanwhile , they claim , those who voice concerns were harassed , mocked and even fired as a consequence of trying to speak out			1
the allegations about northwest @entity2 , which have prompted several investigations and lawsuits , were collated and published in a long report by the @entity42			1
in the most extreme circumstances , a prisoner even died during one of the apparently routine ' gassings '			2
@entity30 , an asthmatic inmate , was blasted with burning pepper spray in june 2010 despite having been treated for his condition that same morning			1
the @entity42 reported that officers then left him laying in his cell , while he foamed at the mouth			2
by the time they called paramedics , it was too late and he soon died			0
prison complex : the alleged abuse took place over years at the @entity9 , above using pepper spray - and in more extreme cases tear gas - is a legal and recognized punishment in the @entity2 prison system , used to subdue very disruptive inmates			1
but , according to the reports , use of the dangerous chemicals - which are blasted repeatedly into inmate 's cells through a flap - was taken to extremes at @entity2			1
the punishment was allegedly used so routinely that corrections officers would fake excuses to use the gas , and in some cases would even fill out paperwork justifying their use of the gas the day before			1
one officer , captain @entity27 , would reportedly gas inmates as punishment if they filed complaints about him			0
some said he would lash out for completely irrational reasons , such as seeing inmates holding rubber bands			0
one prisons officer , @entity88 , said @entity27 accused him of ' cowardice ' for not joining in with a depraved scheme to ' break every finger ' in an inmate 's hand to punish him			1
@entity88 then claims he was forced to resign by a superior			0
@entity27 , and five other guards , were eventually charged and arrested over abuse at the prisons - but the officer , who was reportedly suffering mental health problems , killed himself before he could stand trial			0
prisoners also reported having their mattresses taken away , and going as long as 72 hours with nothing to sleep on but a hard , prison - issue bedframe			2
the abuse is said to spread over years at the prison			0
authorities have since pledged to reform the system and tighten up disciplinary procedures for corrections officers			0
however , critics say that the heads of the prison service say that until the heads of the prison are gone , the problems will persist			0
@entity115 , a civil rights lawyer representing a prisoner who is suing the authorities , said : ' the individuals actually responsible for the abuse to repeatedly occur and continue are still very much a part of today â€™s @entity121 ' .			0
