@entity0 will have the word ‘ @entity2 ’ inserted on their new club crest when they move into the @entity5 in 2016 , if fans approve			1
as the @entity0 enter their penultimate season at @entity8 , the @entity10 club have proposed plans to evolve their emblem with supporters invited to cast a deciding vote on the design			1
@entity16 understands the inclusion of ‘ @entity2 ’ in the sleek design is a nod to @entity0 ’s historic standing in the capital , while helping the ambitious @entity0 make strides in a competitive global football market when they move into their new @entity25 home in less than two years			1
two gold @entity0 will remain through the centre , maintaining a link to the club ’s @entity43 inception back in 1895			1
the design has received a mixed reaction from some supporters on social media , however			2
twitter user @ westhamtransfer wrote : ‘ why do we need ‘ @entity2 ’ on our badge ? if you want to know where @entity0 is then use @entity55 ’			1
another fan , @ @entity57 , said : ‘ the new badge has the right idea but the font used is rubbish			2
’ legends : the likes of @entity63 ( above ) and @entity64 ( below ) have worn the famous crossed hammers but @ @entity67 gave his backing to the new design , saying : ‘ the badge is nice			2
all they have done is remove the castle and added the word @entity2 ’			1
and @ @entity77 added : ‘ talks about the updated @entity0 badge sound positive			2
finally some proper design thought being applied			0
’ @entity0 fans , who have a history of buying tickets with the club , have until this friday to submit their vote on what will be the 16th evolution of the badge that has been worn proudly over the years by greats such as @entity63 , sir @entity87 and sir @entity88			1
an statement on the club ’s official website read : ‘ the board understand that the success of the club ’s move depends on its acceptance among supporters as the home of @entity0			1
‘ the club is therefore on the cusp of a multi-million pound investment at the stadium and so it is imperative to ensure that , together , we get it right from the outset			0
new home : the change of badge will coincide with @entity0 's 2016 move to the @entity5 evolution : the current badge , as seen on new signing @entity113 , is the 15th version of the crest ‘ the crest ’s evolution is the handiwork of world - class designers , who , crucially , are lifelong supporters of the club too			1
' its final design is the product of careful deliberation following supporter consultation and the comprehensive feedback received , as well as a reflection of feeling among the club ’s stakeholders			0
’ @entity0 are not the only @entity10 club to propose plans to modernise their crest			2
@entity135 have also set up a voting process for fans to pick their new badge			0
@entity16 has obtained further images of how the flat design would look , with the 3d version only being used for digital purposes			0
a club source said : ' the two shades of claret are a graphical representation of the @entity148 's bow , the inspiration behind the new crest shape			0
' however , they will only ever be visible in a 3d form and this is not how the crest will appear in the majority of its applications			0
the 3d presentation of the crest will primarily be used across digital platforms			0
new look : the two shades of claret are a graphical representation of the @entity148 's bow , the inspiration behind the new crest shape changing times : the proposed badge will be the 16th evolution of the @entity0 crest ' as the following variations show , the two shades do not apply to single colour versions of the crest , nor to the more traditional flat crest , as would appear on the playing shirt			1
' the proposed crest has been carefully designed to be adaptable with a variety of colour applications and will follow a colour palette that has represented the cub 's historic colours since 1900			0
' that said , the club is still fully absorbing feedback and , should there be overall support for the direction of the crest , these factors can be considered and potentially incorporated ahead of producing final brand guidelines			0
' what do you think of the new @entity0 badge ? tell us in the comments box below … @entity0 supporters with a ticket purchase history aged 16 and over can register their vote here			1
mobile users can access the poll via the following : @entity200			0
