by @entity0 published : 08:45 est , 22 may 2012 updated : 17:05 est , 22 may 2012 @entity2 : @entity3 with her £ 1 doll that has been withdrawn from sale because it has an @entity7 outfit and is in breach of copyright laws with her big blue eyes , blonde mane and a hand - knitted 2012 @entity7 running kit , this doll would make a perfect addition to any little girl ’s collection			1
but not if the jobsworths of the @entity7 authorities have anything to do with it			1
rigid copyright rules over the @entity22 logo mean the widow who made the doll ’s outfit can not put her into a church fundraising sale			2
@entity3 , 81 , spent hours creating the kit for the second - hand doll , which was to go on sale with a £ 1 price tag			1
but after hearing that @entity7 officials jealously guarded their logos , she decided to check with trading standards officers about the tiny @entity35 and @entity7 rings she had embroidered on the t - shirt			1
to her shock , she was told to withdraw the doll from sale to avoid legal action			1
the grandmother of six , from @entity42 , @entity43 , says the rules are ‘ 21st - century silliness ’ and she has written to @entity7 chief @entity45 to complain			1
‘ this is absolutely ridiculous			2
i thought that the hoops symbol was universal and i think it is disgusting that they can make rules about such little things			0
it ’s @entity7 correctness gone mad , ’ she said			1
the doll was handed in to @entity56 ’ charity knitting group by a member of public and she decided to replace its tired outfit			2
red - tape : the tiny @entity35 and @entity7 rings on the doll 's knitted jumper were enough to breach strict copyright rules rules : strict laws have been brought in to ensure that only official stores can sell @entity69 2012 @entity7 merchandise in the @entity71 selling anything with @entity7 or @entity69 2012 names or logos is illegal unless you are an official sponsor			1
that is why companies like @entity78 and @entity79 pay so much for the privilege			0
in the @entity71 , special laws have also been passed to give extra protection			0
people are being prosecuted under the @entity84 and anyone found guilty will get a fine of at least £ 10,000 and a potential jail term			0
but many innocent members of the public are being threatened with the same legislation			0
last year the @entity71 @entity92 was told it could face court proceedings			2
its annual festival of cakes was planned with an @entity7 theme but had to be dumped after they were told it would be illegal			1
they wanted to depict the 2012 games logos in icing and marzipan but the the @entity103 banned them from copying any of its official symbols , including the five rings			0
it was about to go on a stall at a fundraising sale at a church earlier this month when the retired magazine worker was warned about @entity7 copyright			1
mrs @entity3 said : ‘ the doll was taken off the stall and the next wednesday when i met the group they were in high dudgeon			1
they were all for marching on the issue			0
‘ i have considered sending a picture of the doll in her outfit to @entity45 with two added words emblazoned across it – @entity127			1
maybe i should have just sewn “ global gathering of top athletes in @entity133 ’s capital this year ” but unfortunately the t - shirt just was n’t large enough			0
’ the 10in tall doll named @entity135 was being sold to raise money for the group ’s wool fund			1
a @entity140 spokesman said permission to reproduce the rings had to be given by the @entity103			0
‘ it ’s like selling something with the @entity146 logo – even for £ 1 that would be wrong , ’ he added			0
but we ’re not like @entity149			0
we ’ll take things on a case - by - case basis			0
’ a spokesman for @entity153 said : ‘ we were asked whether there was any legislation covering the sale of goods carrying the @entity7 rings and we said yes there is , which is indeed the case			2
’ the official @entity22 website states : ‘ there may be cases where the unauthorised use of our brand is the result of pure enthusiasm for the @entity7 without consideration of our commercial benefit or understanding our legal rights			2
in such cases , we will factor this into our approach			0
’ those breaching the rules face civil action for damages .			0

@entity3 was told that the doll could not be sold because it was emblazoned with tiny @entity7 trademarks
trading standards say they were just *advising* her of the law
