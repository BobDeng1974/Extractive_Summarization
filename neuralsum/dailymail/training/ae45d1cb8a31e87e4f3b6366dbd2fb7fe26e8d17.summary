by @entity0 @entity1 will support an attempt to compel @entity3 by law to spend 0.7 per cent of gdp on foreign aid , after his hand was forced by the @entity8			1
at the last election , all three main parties promised to introduce the law , but the prime minister quietly ditched the policy following fierce protests from the right of his party			0
however , in a move calculated to provoke a damaging @entity20 split on the issue , @entity17 yesterday endorsed a @entity22 ’ @entity23 on the 0.7 target – causing the @entity20 to quickly say their party leadership would support the measure in any @entity28 vote			1
pressure : @entity1 will support an attempt to compel @entity3 by law to spend 0.7 per cent of gdp on foreign aid the @entity8 were copying @entity20 tactics , for mr @entity1 has highlighted mr @entity17 ’s opposition to an @entity36 referendum by supporting a private bill to introduce the vote			1
there is now the bizarre prospect of a @entity42 prime minister speaking in support of the legislation , but backbench @entity45 being free to try to wreck it			2
the @entity23 will be introduced in september by former @entity8 @entity49 secretary @entity48			0
it stands a strong chance of being approved by the @entity28 even without @entity20 support , as @entity54 mps are expected to back the measure			1

official figures show @entity3 hit the 0.7 per cent target for the first time last year after giving away £ 11.4 billion			2
meeting the target required a 30 per cent increase in the budget			2
@entity17 yesterday endorsed a @entity68 on the 0.7 target mr @entity1 has said that hitting the target is his proudest achievement in @entity72 – but many @entity20 mps have argued big increases in spending have been unjustifiable at a time of austerity at home			1
conservative mp @entity79 , a long - standing critic of aid spending , said : ‘ overseas aid should be based on need , not a fixed percentage of gdp			0
if the government is supporting this measure , it should introduce a @entity88			0
it would be outrageous to try to bring it in through the back door , and i will be voting against the damn thing			0
