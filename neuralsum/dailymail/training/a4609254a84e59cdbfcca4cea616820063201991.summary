with its explicit sex scenes featuring bondage , nudity and whips , you might think @entity6 had all the fantasy action any viewer could wish for			2
but there was one scene the producers drew the line at – featuring the film 's main female character @entity6 and ' sexual ' jellyfish			1
the jellyfish were the bizarre idea of the film 's @entity19 director @entity18			1
she said : ' we went to this beautiful aquarium and there were these jellyfish			2
they 're so sexual , jellyfish , when you look at them in tanks – just the way they move , the fluidity			0
' so there was a scene when we go into @entity37 's world and her head , and we just had these jellyfish on the screen			1
everyone went , ' what the f * * * are those jellyfish doing there ? ' ' so we had to take them out			1
i was n't happy to let them go			0
' fifty @entity62 , which stars @entity46 as @entity37 and @entity47 as her sadistic lover @entity6 , is one of the most eagerly awaited films of the year , and its trailer has already been viewed more than 45 million times on @entity67			1
but @entity18 , 47 , said that although the film is true to @entity45 's best - selling book , it may not be as explicit as people might be hoping for			1
' the thing that was most difficult was how and where to pepper the sex , and to not make it feel like it was gratuitous , ' she said			0
' so it had to be a really strong part of the story , and i had to give characterisation to each sex scene , to make them different			0
overruled : director @entity18 ( pictured ) said : ' it was beautiful , very impressionistic ... everyone went , " what the f * * * are those jellyfish doing there ? '' so we had to take them out ' ' i did n't want it to be graphically explicit , and i know that 's going to be disappointing to some people			1
' @entity18 , who is married to @entity19 actor @entity94 , 23 , added in an interview with @entity97 newspaper : ' it 's the build up and titillation of touch and sensuality			2
so i do n't think it goes into the realm of porn			0
' she explained there were constraints on sexual content because she wanted the film to earn an ' r ' rating in the @entity111 – meaning it can be viewed by mainstream audiences			0
@entity18 , an artist who also directed the 2009 @entity115 bio-pic @entity113 , said she had been initially nervous about taking on the project			0
but she added : ' i sat down with @entity94 and he said , ' just do it			0

director wanted to use jellyfish to *portray* inner workings of character 's mind
but the film 's producers thought @entity18 's idea was too bizarre
@entity18 said : ' it was beautiful , very impressionistic ... everyone went , " what the f * * * are those jellyfish doing there ? '' so we had to take them out '
adaptation of @entity45 ' novel is one of the most anticipated films this year
it stars @entity46 as @entity37 and @entity47 as @entity6
