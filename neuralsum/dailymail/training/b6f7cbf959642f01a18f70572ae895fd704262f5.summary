@entity0 is a master of timing , whether he is waiting to charge all 16st 7lb of his enormous frame down the wing or teaching himself to play a piano sonata			1
in a profession where brawn is often prized over brains , @entity0 is proud he can play the saxophone , piano and guitar and complete the @entity12 in less than a minute			1
‘ i ’ve always been good at maths and music and if anyone ever asks , i ’ll tell them , ’ he said , ‘ i ’m not shy about that			0
i sometimes get a bit of stick from the lads but if we ’re out for a meal i can add up the bill quite quickly , so it has its upsides			0
’ @entity0 is a rugby player with a difference , and can complete a @entity12 's cube in less than a minute @entity0 ( left ) holds off @entity28 ' @entity27 ( right ) at the @entity29 playoff week one fixtures @entity0 now has to work out a formula to help his @entity34 team start winning again			1
despite lifting the @entity35 last month , mainly thanks to a man - of - the - match performance and two steamroller tries from @entity0 , @entity34 have lost their last five @entity39 games			1
they plummeted to sixth in the league and head into saturday ’s play - off match against @entity43 needing to win or facing elimination			1
‘ we ’ve not taken the end of the season too much to heart , ’ said @entity0 , ‘ we know we could have finished top of the table potentially but all the talk now is the playoffs , we ’re treating it as a separate competition			1
‘ we have the opportunity to do the double which would be something remarkable given how close the table is			0
@entity28 did it last year and showed it ’s possible to do it in the modern era			0
’ @entity0 , who is known as @entity59 – or world ’s best winger – by his teammates has proven he is a big occasion player			1
‘ i ’ve been faced with these do - or - die games a couple of times and come out on top so hopefully i ’m a bit of an inspiration to the younger players around me , ’ he said			2
the 26 - year - old , who is also part way through an accountancy degree , credits his love of music with keeping him focused on rugby			2
‘ you have a lot of spare time as a professional sportsperson and i spend mine wisely , music a good release and a way to relax , ’ he said , ‘ my mum always wanted me to do music at school to get another string to my bow and i loved it even though none of my circle of friends did it			1
hall in action during the @entity91 's @entity35 semi-final against @entity93 ‘ i ’ve now got a two - year - old , @entity94 , and i ’m encouraging him to be musical			2
he absolutely loves rugby already , the crowds and the music and everything			0
i think if i was to push him into anything it would be golf because their careers last longer and they do n’t have as many injuries			0
’ @entity0 and his fiancée @entity104 , who fostered a child before having @entity94 , also have their own special day coming up			2
the pair will marry on @entity107 , but @entity0 may be taking a break from preparations			2
‘ i ’m hoping to get picked for the @entity111 squad for the tour in @entity113 for six weeks so she ’ll be 100 % in charge , ’ he said , ‘ we ’ve had a couple of arguments already about that one			0
‘ people have told me in the past that getting married is stressful but i just shrugged my shoulders			0
i ’ve got a realistic head on my shoulders when it comes to money whereas @entity104 thinks about money last			0
but with the @entity35 , hopefully the @entity129 and a wedding it will certainly be a good year to look back on if it all goes to plan			0
’ @entity0 celebrates scoring a try during the @entity91 's @entity35 final on august 23rd at @entity133			1
