a design flaw has left a fighter jet that 's part of the @entity3 's most expensive project ever incapable of carrying highly advanced bombs			1
the @entity6 's internal weapons bay is too small for a @entity8 ( @entity8 ) load , according to an @entity10 report			1
though it 's mandated that an @entity6 jet , designed by @entity13 , hold eight @entity14 in the bay , only four reportedly fit			1

trouble in the skies : the @entity6 's internal weapons bay is too small for a @entity8 ( @entity8 ) load ( file photo ) the @entity6 is one of three variants of the @entity16 , which has proved expensive and troublesome to get off the ground			1
the @entity6 features a lift fan that will allow it to make short takeoffs and vertical landings , @entity10 reported			0
in the @entity27 , it will be used by the @entity28			0
however , the @entity6 is the centerpiece of the @entity31 's new aircraft carrier - based fleet			1
the @entity32 has ordered 48 of the aircraft and they are the only fighter jets set to launch off two planned @entity36 aircraft carriers - the @entity37 and the @entity39 @entity38			2
the f - 35 program has been plagued by massive cost overruns and delays			1
@entity43 , a spokesman for the @entity16 , said in an @entity10 interview last week that changes are being made to the @entity6 jet so it can be released on schedule			2
@entity49 also said that @entity13 will likely get the alterations contract down the line in 2015			0
' this is not a new issue to us , ' @entity49 told @entity10			0
' we 've been working with the @entity8 program office and their contractors since 2007			0

the company proclaims on its website ' @entity8 can fly more than 45 miles to strike mobile targets , reducing aircrews ' time in harm 's way			0
the weapon 's small size allows fewer aircraft to take out the same number of targets as previous , larger weapons that required multiple jets			2
@entity8 's size has broader implications for the warfighter and taxpayers , as it means fewer attacks with less time spent flying dangerous missions			0
' the @entity8 can employ a number of techniques - including imaging infrared , laser , and radar homing - to hit targets , the company says			1
the @entity8 weapons system is fully accommodated by both the @entity69 - the @entity109 version - and @entity111 - the @entity113 version , company executive @entity110 told @entity10			0
