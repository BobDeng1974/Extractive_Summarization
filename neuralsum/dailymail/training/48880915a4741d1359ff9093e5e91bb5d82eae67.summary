researchers have determined that standardized tests , such as the @entity24 and @entity25 , give a reasonably good â € ” yet of course imperfect â € ” measure of a person 's general reasoning capacity			0
five groups of @entity2 's elite were examined by @entity32 's @entity31 : @entity3 , federal judges , billionaires , senators , and members of the @entity8			1
' within each of these groups , nearly all had attended college with the majority having attended either a highly selective undergraduate institution or graduate school of some kind , ' @entity31 wrote in the journal intelligence			2

' within the @entity111 and @entity8 , @entity110 had a higher level of ability and education than @entity115			2

billionaire ability and education level by sector : billionaires in the investments and technology sectors had the largest fraction of people who were also in the top 1 % of cognitive ability			1
however , @entity31 wrote in @entity94 that the work did not prove that @entity2 's top performers still had their limits			2
' this does not mean they are geniuses ( i would reserve that term for someone who does mind - bending work like @entity137 ) ; but they are really smart			0
' researchers also analysed the male top female ratio in each group in general the research found women were largely underrepresented			0
notably , female @entity75 were underrepresented by a factor of 28.3 to 1 , @entity31 said			0
' but among those women who had climbed the ranks , they had to be smarter and more select , on average , than their male counterparts , ' he said			0
roughly 60 % of female ceos but only 40 % of male ceos were in the top 1 % of cognitive ability			1
the connection between attending @entity154 and being a part of @entity2 's elite was also investigated			2
roughly 11 % to 13 % of @entity75 , judges , billionaires , and @entity159 had attended @entity154 in some capacity , but only 6.6 % of the @entity8 did so .			2
