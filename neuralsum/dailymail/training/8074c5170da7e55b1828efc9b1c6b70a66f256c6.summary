@entity1 , who served 45 days in jail after the assault , says his record continues to impact him and could prevent businesses , such as restaurants , that work with him from getting licenses			1
he insists he has come a long way since april 1988 , when he attacked @entity83 with a five - foot stick while yelling slurs at him in order to steal the two cases of beer he was carrying			2
troubled past : @entity1 served 45 days in prison after he blinded a man in a 1988 assault documents included in his pardon request show he called the @entity95 immigrant a ' @entity95 f * * * ing s * * * ' before striking him so hard that the stick broke in two and knocked @entity99 , according to the documents shared by @entity101			1
he then fled the scene and approached a second man , @entity103 , put his arm around his shoulder and asked him to help him hide			0
but once police passed , @entity1 hit him , leaving him blind in one eye			1
when @entity110 cops tracked @entity1 down and took him back back to the scene of the assault outside a convenience store in @entity114 , he told officers : ' you do n't have to let him identify me , i 'll tell you now that 's the motherf * * * * * whose head i split open ' , the documents show			1
authorities wrote that he also made ' numerous unsolicited racial statements about ' gooks ' and ' slant - eyed gooks '			0
' in his plea , @entity1 said that he was under the influence of alcohol and drugs at the time			2
' from later accounts of the incident , it is my understanding that i may have caused serious injuries ' to the men , he wrote			0
other documents show that , in an earlier attack in @entity114 , he and two friends saw a group of black siblings and chased them			0
changed man : now , @entity1 is hoping to get a pardon for his past actions scene of the crime : the liquor store where @entity1 attacked a man with a stick and then ran away ' we do n't like black n * * * * * * in the area so get the f * * * away from the area , ' the boys shouted at the group , according to the documents			1
they then chased the boys , shouting : ' kill the n * * * * * , kill the n * * * * * '			0
the following day , the group encountered one of the boys again and threw rocks at him			0
one of the rocks thrown by @entity1 and one of his friends hit a nearby girl			2
the trio caused ' a high level of anxiety , fear and intimidation ' , the documents said			0
though he was then only 16 at the time of the 1988 attack , he was charged as an adult and convicted of assault			1
according to @entity178 the initial charge was attempted murder			0
after emerging from prison , @entity1 went on to find success in music with @entity183 and as a @entity185 model			2
family guy : @entity1 ( above with wife @entity187 and three of his children and @entity190 ) is now committed to multiple charities and attends church every day but it was his appearance in the 1996 film @entity196 that really changed things , catapulting @entity1 into the critically - acclaimed box office juggernaut that he is today			2
' i am deeply sorry for the actions that i took on the night of april 8 , 1988 , as well as for any lasting damage that i may have caused the victims , ' @entity1 wrote in the pardon application			1
' since that time , i have dedicated myself to becoming a better person and citizen so that i can be a role model to my children and others			0
' he devotes much of his time and a large amount of his money to various charities , including the @entity1 and the @entity213			0
he is also a family man now , married to former model @entity187 and the father of four children , and attends church daily			0
the @entity217 will investigate the petition to decide if it warrants a hearing before it is recommended to the governor who by that time will be the recently elected @entity222			0
pardon ? it will ultimately be up to newly elected @entity19 governor @entity222 ( above ) to decide whether or not @entity1 should be pardoned and while erasing the past is important , @entity1 points out that he still talks about what he did to show how much a person can change			2
but he said that , as a convicted criminal , there are still some things he can not do and for that he needs a pardon , including working with law enforcement to help at - risk youth			2
in the end , however , it is about showing his growth			0
' the more complex answer is that receiving a pardon would be a formal recognition that i am not the same person that i was on the night of april 8 , 1988 , ' @entity1 explains			1
' it would be formal recognition that someone like me can receive official public redemption if he devotes himself to personal improvement and a life of good works			0
