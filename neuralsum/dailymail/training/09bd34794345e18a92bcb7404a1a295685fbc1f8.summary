by @entity0 follow @ @ lauriewhitwell @entity2 's 7 - 1 defeat by @entity3 is a result that shook the game			1
not merely for the black and white statistics , not simply for the comprehensive difference of performance between the teams , but also for the context in which it arrived			0
it may be the greatest surprise in history for a combination of reasons but it is not the first			0
we have had truly remarkable wins against the odds , thumping scorelines to astonish , and results difficult to comprehend			0
here , @entity22 charts 10 of the best			0
painful viewing : @entity24 cuts a forlorn figure as he watches his @entity2 side beaten 7 - 1 by @entity3 disbelief : @entity28 fans watch on in shocked silence as their @entity31 dream is brutally ended inconsolable : @entity32 was particularly emotional following the heavy defeat on home soil devastated : @entity35 also struggled to come to terms with the manner of @entity2 's defeat the party is over : @entity2 fans look to have lost the carnival spirit that had previously lit up this @entity31 @entity42 in @entity43 after devastating @entity3 win what is it about @entity43 and humiliation ? sixty - four years before @entity2 suffered in the city , @entity48 were humbled in the biggest upset the @entity31 has seen			1
the @entity51 had lost seven matches in a row with an aggregate goal difference of minus 43 ; @entity48 arrived as the ‘ @entity55 ’ and huge favourites			1
‘ we have no chance , ’ said @entity51 coach @entity57			1
but the @entity51 – an assorted bunch of teachers and postmen – soaked up pressure and scored in the first - half through @entity65 , and then held on for the unlikeliest of wins			1
legend has it some newspapers were so confused by the scoreline coming from @entity72 they thought it a typo and reported @entity48 had won 10 - 1			1
shock loss : @entity76 watches as @entity48 goalkeeper @entity77 is beaten by @entity65 ' shot the @entity2 players from this match at the @entity81 might at least get some respite now			1
for decades they have symbolised dramatic failure in the country which cradles the game like no other , wearing the result like an albatross around their necks			0
they had been expected to easily dismiss @entity92 , a nation of 3 million , in the final match – a draw would have been enough to lift the trophy – and 200,000 fans crammed into the famous stadium in anticipation			0
@entity100 gave the hosts the lead but @entity103 equalised before @entity104 hit the winner goal with 11 minutes left			0
the term @entity107 , roughly translated as ‘ @entity108 ’ , was born			0
hosts horror : the last time @entity2 staged a @entity31 they unexpectedly lost the final match to @entity92 this was the match that shattered @entity114 hubris and swept aside malaise			1
billed as the ‘ @entity116 ’ , bringing the originators of the game versus the no 1 team in the world , @entity48 were supremely confident			1
they had never lost at @entity121 and players such as @entity123 were unknown on these shores			0
but the @entity126 ’ innovative 2 - 3 - 3 - 2 formation and fluid lines showed @entity48 ’s @entity129 system to be outdated , while fitness and coaching methods were also exposed			1
@entity132 scored a hat - trick , @entity123 got two and @entity135 one as @entity48 were trounced			1
for the first time , @entity114 managers started to look to the continent for tactical and training advances			2
revolution : @entity48 's 6 - 3 defeat against @entity142 at @entity121 sparked a major rethink in the @entity114 tactics @entity145 had won their 17th @entity147 title by nine points , losing only two matches , and had collected four @entity151 cups in the previous 11 years			1
@entity152 were a rag - tag group of players more famous for their ‘ @entity157 ’ moniker than trophies , never before lifting a major piece of silverware - indeed , they had only just completed their second ever season in the top flight			2
but on a sunny afternoon at @entity121 @entity163 ’s team pulled off a stunning victory			0
shortly before half - time , @entity166 ’s header from a @entity168 free kick looped over @entity170 and into the net			1
@entity172 then became the first goalkeeper to save an fa cup final penalty to deny @entity175 and @entity152 held on			0
history : @entity166 celebrates after heading @entity152 in front against @entity145 in the @entity179 final crazy gang : @entity152 went on to beat @entity145 and lift the 1988 @entity179 against the odds @entity182 were the team of @entity183 , @entity184 , @entity185 , @entity186 and @entity187			2
they were not short of talent , confidence or know - how , having won the @entity190 two years earlier at @entity121			2
they had only conceded three goals in seven previous matches in the @entity190 in 1993 - 94			2
but at the @entity198 in @entity199 , @entity197 ’s @entity196 produced a performance from the gods to lift the trophy in breathtaking style			0
@entity204 got two , @entity205 scored a beautiful lob , and @entity207 added the exclamation mark to complete one of the greatest displays in the competition ’s history			0
silverware : @entity213 holds the @entity190 aloft following @entity196 's 4 - 0 win against @entity182 in @entity199 the @entity216 job : @entity204 scores the first of his two goals for @entity196 against @entity182 remember the time @entity220 produced his dj celebration in @entity222 to add a surreal gloss to @entity48 ’s most celebrated victory on foreign soil ? it seems such a different time			1
victory for @entity3 , after a 1 - 0 win at @entity121 earlier in the campaign , would have sealed their place at the 2002 @entity31			1
but @entity231 masterminded a remarkable performance that allowed his team to get to the @entity234 first			0
@entity235 opened the scoring early to give the game a familiar feel but then @entity239 grabbed a hat - trick , @entity236 scored a screamer , and @entity220 added the coup de grace			2
huge satisfaction against old rivals and a shock scoreline			0
triumphant : @entity48 's 5 - 1 win against @entity3 in @entity222 is still remembered as one of the iconic results treble top : @entity239 hit a hat - trick for @entity231 's side on that night in @entity222 hosts bombing at crucial moments is not the sole preserve of @entity28			1
@entity255 could have won the @entity256 on home soil , claiming their first trophy in the process , only for @entity260 to arrive like a trojan horse and crash the party			0
the two sides had met in the opening game of the tournament with the same result but @entity255 had grown and looked set to avenge the defeat			2
a young @entity268 and an ageing @entity269 could do nothing to stop the @entity273 game - plan of stifling and set - pieces as @entity275 headed in the only goal from a corner			2
perhaps the least popular underdog victors in history			0
underdogs : @entity260 were unlikely winners of the 2004 @entity256 in @entity283 @entity284 hearted : a young @entity268 was inconsolable after @entity255 's final defeat by @entity260 very rare it is to see a @entity288 team torn to shreds			2
usually he finds a way to stop the bleeding , to administer a tourniquet through tactical improvisation			0
but in the @entity298 , with tiki - taki clicking like clockwork his @entity295 side were shot through time and again as the @entity300 equalled their biggest victory in @entity302			1
this , @entity288 ’s first derby match between @entity305 ’s big beasts , remains the worst defeat of his career			0
@entity309 mesmerised but did not score , leaving it to @entity311 , @entity312 , @entity313 twice and @entity314 to administer the fatal blows			0
@entity182 went on to win @entity316 for the third consecutive year			2
@entity302 : @entity295 were thrashed 5 - 0 at the @entity298 by a @entity182 side at the height of their powers serial winners : @entity182 went on to win @entity316 and the @entity190 in 2010 - 11 @entity321 was when @entity322 were the butt of all jokes in @entity325 ; @entity326 unrivalled in their superiority under sir @entity328 as the blue half undid themselves in comical fashion , dropping as low as the third tier			1
but flush with financial impetus from @entity333 billions , @entity322 travelled to @entity334 to get serious			2
@entity335 scored twice ( revealing his ‘ @entity337 ? ’ t - shirt ) before @entity338 made it three			0
@entity340 was sent off and @entity341 responded as @entity326 chased the game but left themselves open to three goals in the final minutes through @entity344 and an @entity345 double			2
it was @entity326 's worst home defeat since 1955 and the score proved decisive as @entity322 went on to win the @entity350 on goal difference – their first - top flight title in 44 years			1
noisy neighbours : @entity322 confirmed themselves as an emerging power by thrashing @entity326 why always me ? @entity335 reveals ' that ' t - shirt after scoring against @entity326 in the @entity357 on target : @entity345 was among the goalscorers in the shock win at @entity334 this was the result that confirmed a 7 - 0 aggregate victory for the @entity364 and , more importantly , punctured the impregnability of @entity300 dominance			1
@entity182 had finessed a brand of high - pressing , one - touch football to such precision that it led to a permanent place at the business end of @entity373 ’s premier competition and manifold trophies			1
but @entity375 trounced the team who had won the @entity190 twice in four years by going for the jugular			0
@entity379 sent his side out with ruthless intent and @entity382 , @entity383 and a @entity385 own goal ensured a result to send tremors across the continent			0
power shift : @entity390 , @entity383 and @entity382 revel in their victory against @entity182 disbelief : @entity375 beat @entity182 3 - 0 at the @entity298 in the @entity190			1

@entity2 's @entity31 defeat by @entity3 one of the biggest shocks ever
historic @entity31 *semi-final* ranks *alongside* some of the great upsets
@entity326 's 6 - 1 defeat to @entity322 , @entity182 's 5 - 0 *hammering* of @entity295 feature among recent shocks
@entity48 's defeats by @entity51 and @entity142 also figure among all - time shocks
