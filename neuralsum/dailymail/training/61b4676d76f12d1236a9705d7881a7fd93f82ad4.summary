a former @entity1 footballer tested positive for cocaine , yet only received a two month suspension , it was revealed tonight			0
in a @entity8 dispatches investigation , @entity6 striker @entity5 was revealed to have tested positive for the drug during the 2009/10 season			1
the programme also unveiled a cover up by both the club and the @entity14 after former manager @entity15 said that the striker was out injured			1
positive test : former @entity18 footballer @entity17 was found to have taken cocaine in 2009 , but was banned for just two months @entity15 said that he had had a reaction to an operation the previous year so would miss three or four months of action			0
neither @entity23 , @entity15 or @entity18 would comment on the allegations			0
the programme , who obtained a secret document , also named several players as having tested positive over the past eight years			1
they included @entity29 , a former @entity30 player who now plays for a lower league club , who tested positive in september 2003			0
he was banned for six months			0
banned : @entity29 was given a six - month suspension after he was found to have taken cocaine in september 2003 the programme also named @entity36 player @entity35 , while specifying that unnamed players from @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 have also tested positive			2
the investigation also uncovered widespread discrepancies in the bans given to players who had been found with the drug in their system			2
it found that footballer ’s ban was dependent on when the offence occurred ; with @entity51 of @entity52 receiving a three month ban as he was not caught on a match day			0
however @entity55 , a @entity56 player , who was caught following a game , received just seven months			0
in many other sports he would have received a two year ban			0
dispatches found that the @entity62 anti-doping agency have caught up to 43 professional footballers using cocaine , ecstasy or cannabis in out - of - competition testing			0
the programme also discussed 240 ‘ abandoned ’ tests between april 2007 and august 2010			1
this is when testers arrive at training grounds to discover that the players targeted were not there			0
it found that @entity76 had been involved in eight abandoned tests , while @entity78 were involved in 15 and @entity79 12			2
the @entity14 has said it will wait until the programme has finished until responding but it is understood officials were disappointed because they consider their testing to be more extensive than in any other sport in the country			1
in a statement to @entity60 , the @entity14 said : ‘ the @entity14 operates a comprehensive anti-doping programme which is the largest of any sport in the @entity62			1
the @entity14 go beyond the @entity89 by proactively testing all samples for social drugs , irrespective of whether the tests are conducted in or out of competition			1
’ exposé : the document revealed that 43 professional footballers have been caught using cocaine , ecstasy or cannabis in out - of - competition testing football pays for more than 60 per cent of tests on athletes in the @entity62 , and their policy of protecting the identity of players who fail out - of - competition tests for recreational drugs is not in breach of any @entity111 regulations			2
@entity111 do n’t even demand that athletes are tested out of competition for recreational drugs			0
those who fail tests for these sorts of drugs in competition are named by the @entity14			1
but the policy of protecting those exposed this evening - the @entity14 consider it better to treat and educate them privately - is questioned by the head of @entity111 , @entity122			1
asked whether the @entity14 should disclose how many players are tested or how many tests take place , he replied : ‘ the answer to that is why not ? if you do n’t then you are susceptible to an allegation that you ’re hiding something			1
‘ they ’re saying they have n’t got a doping problem because there are not many positive tests			2
i think the answer to that is : do n’t we need to conduct better research to see what the prevalence of doping is ? until we are satisfied by the use of all the gathering of evidence i do n’t think we ’re in a position to say ( there is not a drug problem in @entity150 football )			2

failed drug tests were never made *public* by @entity14
@entity14 will wait to see programme before responding
