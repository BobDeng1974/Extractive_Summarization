by @entity0 it looks uncannily like the @entity3 robot from the @entity5 films , but in fact this roving robot is already hard at work in a @entity10 hospital , zapping superbugs			2
the robots emit ultraviolet light that penetrates and damages bacteria , including @entity22 ( @entity22 ) , methicillin - resistant @entity15 ( @entity14 ) and @entity17 - resistant enterococci ( @entity18 ) , all of which are commonly referred to as ' superbugs ' because they are highly resistant to traditional antibiotic treatments			1
the $ 67,000 machine emits uv light to penetrate through the cell walls of bacteria and viruses and destroy their dna , rendering them unable to reproduce			1
@entity5 metal @entity3 - who resembles the new breed uf superbug killing robot after a hospital environmental services employee thoroughly cleans a room with germicidal disinfectant , a trained technician wheels the robot into the room , opens all the interior doors and drawers to expose surfaces where germs could lurk , turns on and programs the robot , and leaves the room			2
the machine then emits the uv light to penetrate through the cell walls of bacteria and viruses and destroy their dna , rendering them unable to reproduce			1
the process can take as little as 15 minutes or more than an hour , depending on the size of the room			0
it is also being tested in dozens of other hospitals across the @entity63 , including @entity64			1
the newest uv robot , nicknamed ' @entity66 , ' was recently given to @entity67 by the @entity68			1
since february , the health system has used uv robots in a pilot project at three of its other hospitals – @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 – and is considering them for additional hospitals			1
' hospital - associated infections are an issue nationwide and preventing them at @entity36 hospitals is a top priority			2
video source @entity82 ' these robots , coupled with our many other infection prevention measures , are an important tool in ensuring patient safety			0
we are grateful to the @entity68 for helping us to expand their use , ' said @entity90 , chief quality officer of @entity36			0
' the robot enhances the cleaning done by our employees			2
the robots emit ultraviolet light that penetrates and damages bacteria , including @entity22 ( @entity22 ) , methicillin - resistant @entity15 ( @entity14 ) and @entity17 - resistant enterococci ( @entity18 ) , all of which are commonly referred to as ' superbugs ' because they are highly resistant to traditional antibiotic treatments			1
using a variety of methods , high - energy ultraviolet light in the area of the spectrum known as @entity105 is produced by either mercury or xenon gas lamps			0
this @entity105 energy passes through the cell walls of bacteria , viruses and bacterial spores			1
once the @entity105 energy is inside the microorganism , it is absorbed by the dna , @entity118 and proteins			0
one of the primary mechanisms of damage created by @entity105 is the fusing of the strands of @entity117 creating what is known as ' thymine dimers			0
' once the dna is fused , the organism can no longer replicate and is , therefore , no longer infectious			0
the technical term for this is ' deactivation			0
' ' the robot does not scrub surfaces or remove dirt ; it kills microscopic germs that can be missed in even the most thorough cleaning , ' said @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity36 infectious disease physician			0
previous peer - reviewed studies at hospitals outside the @entity36 system have shown that uv robots reduce bacterial contamination in hospital rooms by as much as 95 percent and cut hospital - associated infections by more than half			2
robots at work : the gadget raises its ' head ' before emitting pulses of uv light healthcare associated infections , or superbugs , are infections acquired by patients during the course of receiving care for another condition , and can be contracted in a variety of ways			1
these infections , such as @entity14 and @entity22 , can be devastating and even deadly , and affect approximately 1 out of every 20 patients			0
in the @entity63 each year , more people die from a lack of hospital infection control than from @entity164 , breast cancer , and auto accidents combined , and have an estimated annual cost of $ 40 billion .			1
