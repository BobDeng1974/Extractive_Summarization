@entity0 ‘ woke up in 1995 ’ after his crash in testing at @entity4 ’s @entity3 , according to reports in @entity6			1
the extent of the double world champion ’s memory loss has been revealed in @entity10 , a daily newspaper close to @entity0 and his management			1
they reported that when asked who he was , @entity0 replied : ‘ i ’m @entity0 , i drive go - karts and i want to be a @entity17 driver			1
’ @entity0 waves as he leaves hospital but it has been reported he was confused when waking up in 1995 , @entity0 was a 13 - year - old pupil at @entity20 in his home town of @entity22 , northern @entity6			1
when doctors pressed him further , @entity0 , 33 , could not remember his debut with @entity25 in 2001 or his world championships for @entity27 in 2005 and 2006			0
the reports in @entity6 came 48 hours after @entity28 revealed concerns that @entity0 may have an underlying condition that caused him to crash a week last sunday and which throw his future career into doubt			1
@entity0 gives the thumbs up after his crash			2
@entity36 have refused to comment on his medical state despite @entity40 and ct scans during three nights in hospital in @entity4 and further tests in @entity22 on monday , there are no assurances from his doctors , management or @entity36 team that he will return for the @entity49 @entity48 on march 29			1
he has already been ruled out of the opening race in @entity51 on sunday week			0
the concussion he suffered in @entity4 means he can not be exposed to a second knock to the head , which doctors fear could kill him , regardless of the wider questions about his health			0
a @entity36 spokesman said : ‘ as regards @entity0 ’s medical situation , @entity36 will not and indeed should not take the lead , since his medical care is being handled by the people best equipped for that task , namely his doctors			2
‘ so all we can say is that he is making good progress , and that we hope and expect he will soon be back to his brilliant best			0
’ @entity0 is reported by @entity10 to have said : ' i 'm @entity0 , i drive go karts and i want to be a formula 1 driver ' white screens are lifted as @entity0 is treated and taken to an air ambulance following his crash medics act quickly to ensure @entity0 is secure as he is wheeled closer to a waiting air ambulance @entity36 staff are not necessarily close to @entity0 , after he left the team in 2007 following a season of infighting , and may not even know their driver ’s condition as well as do some reporters in @entity6 do			1
confusion has , therefore , surrounded the situation , not least after @entity36 chairman @entity84 said that @entity0 had not been concussed , a misunderstanding that was corrected by the team ’s official statements			2
@entity88 , a former @entity36 driver , said : ‘ my experience of getting knocked out or having big shunts is that you remember the bit before , the bit after but not the bit in the middle			1
when you get knocked out it does not come as a warning ; it just happens			0
the @entity97 - 30 of @entity0 is recovered back to the pits on the back of a truck following the crash ‘ the brain is a fairly complex bit of kit , so if they are not able to see any brain injury of any sort it seems a bit medically confusing for me , so there is probably more from the story to come out over time			2
it is unusual for drivers to miss a grand prix over such a thing			0
’ whatever the cause , @entity0 ’s predicament is a blow for @entity36 , whose form in testing suggested they are struggling very badly indeed for reliability and speed			1
they signed him on a £ 28million - a - year contract at the start of their new relationship with @entity127 , yet will replace him with @entity128 , their 22 - year - old @entity129 reserve driver , at @entity51 ’s @entity131			2
a helicopter was used to transport @entity0 from the @entity3 to hospital on february 22 @entity134 , @entity17 ’s former chief doctor , has speculated that the most probable reason @entity0 might have passed out would be arrhythmia — an irregular heartbeat			0
if so , he would require a pacemaker			0
another possibility , said @entity134 , would be carotid sinus hypersensitivity , whereby pressure on the main artery to the brain causes the heart rate to drop , blood pressure to fall and the sufferer to blackout			0
@entity134 told the @entity148 that this was ‘ surprisingly common ’ , and not totally unexpected at a fast corner in a @entity17 car , such as @entity151 at @entity4 , where @entity0 was travelling at 134mph			0
@entity0 was flown away by helicopter following the crash at the @entity4 but , then again , he was braking and changing down gears as the accident unfolded , so how is this consistent with his having passed out ? the questions nag			0
@entity0 will need the @entity158 ’s medical team to give him clearance to race in @entity49 , as well as the go - ahead from his own doctors			0
he has been outwardly relaxed about missing the @entity51 race , saying from his father ’s house in @entity22 , where he is recovering : ‘ a second impact in less than 21 days ( the stipulated period of rest ) — no. ’ @entity0 may have been less sanguine if @entity36 were quicker , but both team and man will be mightily relieved when , he is back , even if it is towards the back of the grid for now			1
onlookers fear the worst as @entity6 driver @entity0 is taken away by an air ambulance following his crash @entity0 is airlifted from the scene following his crash in preseason at the track just outside of @entity4			1

reports in @entity6 claim @entity0 suffered memory loss after crash
the @entity36 driver spent three days in hospital after crash during testing
he will miss the season - opening @entity191 @entity48 in @entity51
