@entity0 : 01:58 est , 21 december 2013 @entity1 : 11:39 est , 21 december 2013 a visibly exhausted president @entity2 was pictured boarding @entity3 with his daughters @entity5 and @entity6 friday night as the first family left @entity8 for @entity9			1
every year the @entity2 family spends @entity11 in the president 's home state , where he recharges with shaved ice , football on the beach and a few holes of golf			1
like many of us , mr @entity2 already seemed in a vacation state - of - mind when he gave his last press conference of the year earlier in the day			2
' you know , the end of the year is always a good time to reflect and see what can you do better next year , ' mr @entity2 told reporters			0
' that 's how i intend to approach it			0
this will be the first family 's sixth @entity11 in @entity9 since he was elected president , and in keeping with tradition they are expected to spend their 17 - day vacation in the @entity58 neighborhood of @entity59			1
the @entity60 announced last week that the @entity5 would depart on december 21 , since it was expected to be a light work schedule for the president in @entity8			1
the first family are spending their sixth @entity11 in a row in @entity9 which will cost taxpayers $ 100,000 the president and his family traditionally spend their @entity11 break in a rented private beach front residence with spectacular ocean views			1
the @entity5 cover the cost of the accommodation that typically costs up to $ 3,500 a day , or $ 75,000 a month , but local and federal taxpayers help pay their travel and security bill which costs in the region of $ 1 million			1
for his first three years in office , the @entity5 rented a $ 24,500 - per - week gated @entity80 , which offered security and privacy on the white sand beach of @entity84			2
since then the @entity5 have rented a few different houses on @entity86 , which has provoked different opinions from those who live in the area			2
christmas traditions : the @entity2 will surely stop by @entity90 in @entity59 for some shaved ice the @entity2 's will cover the cost of their accommodation , but local and federal taxpayers help pay their travel and security bill ' it 's exciting			1
it 's really an honor to have him here , and when he 's around â € “ actually the place is super safe because we have all this security around , â € ™ @entity98 , who lives locally , told @entity99			0
' we go through two security points and so the second one , we have to get out of our car			0
we have to be searched ourselves , plus our car has to be completely searched , ' said a woman called @entity109 , who has lived on the street for more than four decades			0
when the president visits , the canal running through the @entity113 neighborhood is off limits and is patrolled by @entity116 and a @entity118 cutter is positioned in the bay			0
it is one of the many security measures put in place , including military blockades on the beach and security checkpoints along the street where he stays			0
island time : president @entity2 is pictured with his daughters and other kids as they head down to the beach ' i understand he 's the president and so he needs his security , but i 'd like for him to pick next year another spot			2
this would be really nice , ' said @entity109			0
' at first it was exciting , but now it 's no longer exciting			0
' last year , @entity2 was forced to cut short his vacation and fly back to @entity8 on the day after @entity11 to resume negotiations on an emergency budget deal with @entity143			1
this year , @entity143 is on track to approve a two - year budget deal before the @entity11 holiday and so he is n't scheduled to return to @entity8 until january 5 .			2

the first family left @entity8 *tonight* for their annual @entity11 trip to @entity9
the @entity5 are expected to spend a little more than two weeks on @entity58 in the president 's home state
the trip will cost taxpayers an *estimated* $ 100,000 , although the @entity5 pay for their own accommodation
