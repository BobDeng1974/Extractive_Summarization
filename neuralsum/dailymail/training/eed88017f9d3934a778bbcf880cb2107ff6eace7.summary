@entity132 : despite fans complaining , @entity0 still maintains he was only 40 minutes late to stage one @entity9 worker , who did not want to be named , told @entity136 : ' he was arguing with members of his management , his family			1
it was a really uncomfortable atmosphere			0

curious : wearing two expensive watches it 's a wonder how @entity0 could n't see he was late to his own concert another backstage source added : ' his lateness was because he did n’t get out of bed until late and sat in his dressing room playing games - even though his door was being knocked			1
' ' he then threw a strop as he said he wanted a shower first , despite already being late			2
' it is thought @entity0 arrived at the @entity165 at 3pm ' to do some meet and greets ' but he was suffering after a ' heavy night at his hotel			2

however , when their idol finally arrived , they say he spent ' less than ten seconds ' with him			0
she also claims the singer declined to give her a hug , ironically telling his fan ' i do n't have time			0
' a source close to @entity0 said : ' there was no competition winner that we knew or approved of			1

his attitude was , " i ’m the star and i can do what i want "			0
