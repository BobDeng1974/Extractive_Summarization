@entity1 's @entity0 and @entity3 's @entity2 are set to reach a @entity5 milestone this weekend when they each make their 100th appearance			1
both players have been hugely influential since they moved to @entity9 in the summer of 2012 , but who has been the most exciting import to watch ? here , @entity12 's reporters choose the player they most enjoy seeing in action			1
@entity0 ( @entity15 ) and @entity2 are both set to make their 100th @entity5 appearance this weekend @entity17 @entity2 has wonderful balance			1
@entity2 is two - footed			1
so , while there is not a lot to choose between them and @entity0 is likely to get the most picks in this article , i am going for @entity2			1
it 's a personal choice			2
he is a wonderful footballer			0
i have paid to watch them both ( and i will pay to watch them both again ) , but the little @entity33 magician edges it for me			0
verdict : @entity35 @entity2 , pictured in action against @entity37 , has been an influential part of @entity3 's midfield this season @entity40 i remember when @entity41 baulked at paying @entity0 's wages when the @entity43 was up for grabs in 2012			1
back then @entity41 thought the young forward had a rather high opinion of his own worth for a player who was yet to play in a major @entity50 league			0
in the early days of his time at @entity1 , it looked as though @entity41 may have been right			2
he showed flashes of brilliance but also looked rather too easy to push off the ball			0
roll forward to 2015 , however , and the 24 - year - old has developed in to one of the most important players in the @entity5			1
brave , strong and ambitious , @entity0 plays on the front foot and with only one thought in this mind			2
rather like @entity64 , he has also developed in to the type of player ever defender hates , simply because he gets back up every time he is knocked to the ground			0
he would get in every team in the @entity5 and is one of the reasons @entity1 will win the title this season			1
verdict : hazard hazard controls the ball under pressure from @entity78 midfielder @entity77 at @entity79 @entity80 it has to be hazard			0
i saw him play for @entity84 twice in the season before he joined @entity1 – once against @entity86 , the other was what proved to be his final appearance against @entity90			1
he scored two in the first match , a hat - trick the latter and played a different game to those around him			0
he has n't disappointed since arriving here and i love the nonchalance with which he takes a penalty , his low centre of gravity and the way he can bamboozle defenders			0
if there is such a thing as £ 32million bargain , it is hazard			0
verdict : hazard hazard celebrates after scoring a fine individual goal in @entity1 's 3 - 2 win against @entity112 in march @entity113 now this is a tricky one because while @entity0 will frequently embark on a dribble or dink in a pass that will make you nod in appreciation , he 'll also miss a penalty and make you groan			1
whereas the older @entity2 , less flashy but no less of a technical master , is to my mind more of a fulcrum , more important relatively to the sum of @entity3 's parts than @entity0 is to @entity1			1
you 'll gasp at hazard but @entity2 's wow factor is richer			1
that 's not to dismiss either : both are brilliant footballers , contributing goals , assists and flair			2
any neutral would bite your hand off to have either playing in your team			0
forced to pick though , it 's @entity2 , for his consistency and crucially doing it in the biggest games			1
exhibit a would be @entity41 0 @entity3 2 in january ; goal , assist , all - round brilliance , against a big team , at an important time			1
verdict : @entity35 @entity2 scores from the penalty spot in @entity146 's 2 - 0 away win at @entity41 in january @entity148 - @entity147 @entity0 for me			1
@entity2 is an utter delight , a little pinball of a man who is probably the most two - footed player i 've seen			1
put him in a tight space and then you see what makes him rare among the best			0
but @entity0 is the top player in the @entity5 , in my opinion			1
this is the sixth of his eight seasons as a professional where he has reached double figures and yet he offers so much more than goals ( 36 in 99 in the @entity5 for @entity1 )			1
he can beat a man and , better still , you sense he likes doing it			0
technically , his passing and shooting are excellent and he also has a mind capable of sussing out the shapes and systems in front of him			0
that intelligence , more specifically his speed of thought , is probably what makes separates the good from the brilliant			0
a complete player who does n't yet seem to have the complete ego			0
verdict : hazard hazard gets away from @entity180 ( left ) and @entity181 at @entity79 @entity182 has to be hazard for me			0
the way he carries the ball through ever tightening spaces and emerges the other side is a joy			0
like one of those @entity192 impossible escapes from a sliding door or rolling boulder			0
and his penalties are mesmeric			0
i could watch them again and again not working out how he does it			0
verdict : hazard @entity43 international hazard scores a header past @entity202 goalkeeper @entity201 at @entity203 @entity204 both are marvellous players , but i could watch @entity2 all day			1
when he first arrived in @entity206 i remember , whilst sitting in the @entity203 press box , trying to work out whether he was left or right footed			0
he was wonderful that day as @entity3 cruised to a 3 - 1 win ; it was one of the most complete performances i 've seen live			2
in truth , i 've still got no idea whether he 's left or right footed			0
he 's that natural on either			0
hazard is a phenomenon , but aesthetically no on can touch @entity2 in the @entity5			1
verdict : @entity35 @entity2 grins after scoring @entity3 's fourth goal against @entity217 at the @entity218 in february @entity219 from a purely artistic sense , @entity2 is probably the most graceful individual on the ball in the entire @entity5			1
but @entity0 provides moments to really stick in the memory			2
he glides past opponents effortlessly and regularly chips in with important goals - plenty of them stunning in their execution			2
the one blot from @entity2 's point of view is that his genius can be fleeting			2
verdict : hazard @entity232 @entity233 has told him to add more goals to his game to move on a par with @entity237 and @entity64 and , three years younger than the @entity238 and six than the @entity239 , he is not far from doing that			2
i 've watched @entity0 countless times at @entity79 this season and he makes the game seem like an art form with his movement , dribbling and passing			2
@entity2 can excite at times , but he is nowhere near consistently reaching @entity0 's level			1
for me there is no contest between the pair			0
verdict : hazard hazard tucks home yet another penalty during @entity1 2 - 1 win against @entity78 last weekend @entity255 i would far rather have hazard in my team , but i ca n't help but feel the excitement has been stripped from him under @entity233			1
efficient , technically brilliant , effective and hard - working he most certainly is - and he will be crowned @entity260 - but he is no longer the daring dribbler of whom we heard so much about during his teenage years in @entity264			0
he is , though , arguably a better player for @entity233 's influence			2
@entity2 , meanwhile , would never thrive under @entity233 , there is too much of @entity267 about him			2
but there is no doubt he is thrilling to watch on his day - it 's just a shame those days are n't as frequent as they should be for a player of his calibre			2
verdict : hazard result : hazard 7 - 3 @entity35 hazard has been voted as a more exciting player than @entity2 in @entity12 's survey			1

@entity1 star @entity0 is set to make his 100th top - flight appearance
@entity2 should hit the same milestone when @entity3 meet @entity37
both players have impressed since moving to the @entity5 in 2012
hazard has more goals this season but @entity2 has one more assist
