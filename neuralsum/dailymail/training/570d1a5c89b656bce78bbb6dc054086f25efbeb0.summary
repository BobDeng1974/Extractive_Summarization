by @entity0 published : 18:50 est , 15 july 2013 updated : 19:28 est , 15 july 2013 add retailers to the list of groups tracking the movements and habits of unsuspecting people.in an effort to gain the competitive advantage websites have had for years , stores have begun tracking shoppers movements and moods through their cell phones and with special cameras that can recognize facial expressions – without shoppers ' consent			1
recent reports of this activity have raised privacy concerns despite repeated assurances from merchants that no personal information is collected from @entity23 the stores using the tracking technology are @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 according to reports			1
@entity32 used the technology last autumn in a pilot , but discontinued the program after public outcry			2
tracking you : @entity32 was tracking shopper movements through the @entity40 signals in their cell phones until ending the program earlier this year @entity32 stores posted signs telling customers about the tracking program , but shoppers interviewed by a @entity47 tv station were unaware of it since the signs were placed in hard to notice locations , near an entrance at floor level in one @entity54 shopper told the station it was ‘ scary ’ and another called it an invasion of her privacy			1
@entity32 and @entity32 were able to track shopper behaviors via a smartphone ’s wifi signal , which allowed the retailer to analyse how long a shopper spent in a particular area and to track shopper movements , as well as how many people that walked past the store decided to walk in , according to a report by the @entity69			2
@entity32 stopped the pilot in may after customer complaints became too numerous , according to reports			2
@entity73 a spokesperson for @entity75 , the firm who supplied the technology , told the station that his firm does n't identify shoppers and declined to name other stores using the tracking tech ' we never know the name or identity of a particular consumer , so you know , we do n't identify the names of our clients either , ' @entity73 added			1
not just in the store : shoppers not even entering stores can be tracked with the technology stores want this information because they are at a disadvantage to online retailers like @entity99 that are able to track shopper movements around the sites through the use of cookies , allowing the online competitors to recommend additional products and show what other people who bought one thing also bought			1
notice : this sign notifying shoppers they were being tracked was found by a @entity47 tv station - practically on the floor ‘ brick - and - mortar stores have been disadvantaged compared with online retailers , which get people ’s digital crumbs , ’ @entity115 , head of technology firm @entity118 ’s emerging technologies group , told the @entity119 is one of a number of vendors that provide cameras to stores looking to track how long people spend in a given department , which can tell them how to best organize stores or streamline individual aisles			1
@entity134 , according to the @entity69 , combines the power of video with the trail of cookie crumbs left behind by cell phones			0
their technology is able to not only track shopper movements , but also identify repeat customers – without a phone even connecting to store ’s @entity40 network			0
this is because phones looking for @entity40 networks still send a unique identifier even if they do n’t connect to a specific @entity150 are also using cameras to analyze facial expressions and @entity153 , based in @entity154 , uses facial recognition at store checkouts to tailor marketing based on gender , age and mood , according to the @entity69			0
‘ if you are an angry man of 30 , and it is friday evening , it may offer you a bottle of whiskey , ’ @entity161 told the @entity163 companies allow people to opt - in and provide some basic personal information that pinpoints them in a store department and can send them coupons aimed at encouraging a purchase , something at least one shopper who spoke to the @entity69 liked			0
‘ i would just love it if a coupon pops up on my phone , ’ @entity175 said			0
@entity179 was unable to reach any of the stores or technology vendors named in this article for further comment .			0

@entity32 ended their use of this technology in may
