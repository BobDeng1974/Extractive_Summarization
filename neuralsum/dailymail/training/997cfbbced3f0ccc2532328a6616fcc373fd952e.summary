by @entity0 published : 08:22 est , 26 april 2013 updated : 09:16 est , 26 april 2013 being overweight and drinking alcohol dramatically increases the risk of developing fatty liver disease , according to a study presented at the @entity5			1
a study of over 100,000 @entity8 women found that being overweight and drinking alcohol regularly increased the chances of suffering and dying of the disease threefold			1
dr @entity12 , of the @entity13 , said : ‘ it 's well known that alcohol and a person 's weight are major causes of chronic liver disease , but there has been a need for a large population study to compare these factors ' influences on each other			1
cut back on wine and sweet treats : being overweight and drinking alcohol significantly increases risk of deadly liver disease ‘ interestingly , the research found the combination of a woman 's drinking habits and weight has an important effect on liver health and life expectancy			1
’ the study , conducted by dr @entity40 and professor @entity41 at the @entity42 , analysed 107,000 women			0
all participants were classed as having a low or high @entity45 and a low or high alcohol intake ranging zero and 15 units a week			0
one unit is about one 25ml single measure of whisky or half a standard glass of wine			0
@entity45 helps gauge whether a person is under or overweight			0
people who have a @entity45 of 25 or over are classed as overweight			0
the study found that compared to a thin woman who did not drink , drinkers were at 1.8 times the risk of developing the disease			0
overindulging in sweet treats and alcohol is fuelling rise in liver disease those who did not drink but were overweight had 1.7 times the risk of the disease			1
but those who did both were at three times at risk of fatty liver disease			2
dr @entity72 explained : ‘ these findings will have a significant impact on how we can help millions of people across the world at risk of developing liver disease			2
liver disease is now the fifth biggest killer in the @entity8 with the number of people dying from it rising by 20 per cent over the past decade			1
however , there are often no warning signs until it is far advanced , so many people could have the potentially fatal condition without even realising it			0
women are at particular risk as they are twice as sensitive as men to alcohol related liver damage and developing a more severe form of the disease			2
the @entity8 government advises not to regularly drink more than the daily unit guidelines of 3 to 4 units of alcohol for men and 2 to3 units of alcohol for women , where ' regularly ' means drinking every day or most days of the week .			2

number of people dying from condition has risen by 20 per cent over the past decade
