@entity1 captain @entity0 could miss at least the start of @entity5 's @entity4 campaign after he was sent off for elbowing an opponent in the face at @entity8			1
the controversial hooker 's career has been scarred by repeated disciplinary episodes , including a 26 - week ban for eye - gouging in 2007 and an 11 - week suspension for verbally abusing referee @entity15 during the 2013 @entity17 final against @entity18			0
that latter ban led to him missing the @entity22 tour of @entity23 , and @entity25 disciplinary chiefs could easily take a dim view of his latest indiscretion			0
referee @entity29 shows @entity1 hooker @entity0 a red card in the 17th minute @entity32 lock @entity31 gets an offload away despite the attention of @entity35 and @entity36 @entity18 winger @entity37 crosses for the first of his two tries at @entity8 it happened after just 17 minutes of a titanic @entity41 that 14 - man @entity1 won 23 - 19 thanks to substitute @entity44 's 77th - minute try that fly - half @entity45 converted from the touchline			1
saints had earlier delivered tries for prop @entity50 and replacement @entity51 , plus two @entity45 penalties , with the lead changing hands five times during a pulsating second period			0
wing @entity37 claimed two touchdowns for @entity18 , which followed an early penalty try , while @entity61 and @entity62 each kicked a conversion			2
saints prop @entity50 is all smiles after he crashed over in the corner for the home side referee @entity29 seemed happy to award a yellow card when @entity0 's elbow caught @entity18 centre @entity70 in the face			1
as @entity70 fell to the ground , a brawl broke out involving several players , but television match official @entity76 urged @entity29 to watch further replays , and he responded by sending 61 times - capped @entity0 off			2
@entity5 open their @entity4 campaign against @entity79 in @entity80 on february 6 , and given 28 - year - old @entity0 's poor record - biting and punching offences also appear on his charge - sheet - another lengthy suspension appears likely , with a disciplinary hearing set to be convened before @entity85			0
and the only current consolation for @entity0 is that @entity64 will lead the @entity17 going into the festive period after they showed immense character to keep @entity18 out			1
@entity1 and @entity5 centre @entity89 ( left ) makes a strong run as @entity61 puts in a hit @entity5 centre @entity89 returned to @entity1 's starting line - up , while two changes up - front following last saturday 's 67 - 0 @entity96 stroll against @entity98 @entity97 saw starts for locks @entity100 and number eight @entity102			1
@entity18 , meanwhile , showed four changes - all in the pack - following their defeat against @entity107 champions @entity106 seven days ago , with hooker @entity108 , lock @entity109 , flanker @entity110 and number eight @entity111 all featuring , and prop @entity113 made his 200th @entity18 first team appearance			0
the initial flurries were fast and furious , but @entity18 held their own in set - pieces and open play , with skipper @entity119 kicking cleverly to put his team in the right areas as @entity5 coaches @entity122 and @entity124 looked on			0
but it quickly became a nightmare for the red rose hierarchy as @entity0 was red - carded , before @entity18 rammed home their dominance with a penalty try that @entity61 converted			2
@entity1 replacement @entity131 crosses for the match - winning try three minutes before full - time @entity0 's exit sent shock - waves reverberating around the ground , and @entity64 forwards coach @entity137 appeared particularly animated as he spoke with the fourth official after @entity0 had trudged dejectedly off			1
@entity1 , though , did not lose their poise in such circumstances , and two @entity45 penalties - the second after @entity110 was sin - binned for a high tackle on @entity64 wing @entity144 - brought the home side back to 7 - 6 behind by half - time			0
and with @entity110 still off , @entity64 went ahead for the first time after cleverly recycling possession , and @entity50 , who scored a dramatic late try to secure @entity17 title glory for @entity1 at @entity152 ' expense seven months ago , touched down			1
@entity131 is mobbed his his team - mates as the 14 - man @entity64 celebrate a famous win over their arch - rivals full - back @entity157 missed the conversion attempt - @entity45 was off receiving treatment after being hit by a high @entity70 tackle - but @entity1 had put down a marker , despite being one man short			1
@entity18 took a time to weather the storm , yet they hit back after 61 minutes when replacement fly - half @entity62 , who took over from @entity70 as @entity61 moved out one position , made a sharp break before @entity37 touched down under little pressure			2
@entity61 could not add the conversion , but @entity18 took a 12 - 11 advantage that lasted just four minutes as @entity45 's brilliant pass highlighted a slick handling move that was finished off by @entity51			0
back came @entity18 , though , through @entity37 's second try that was sparked by his fellow wing @entity175 's burst , yet @entity64 were not to be denied and @entity44 administered the finishing touch of a scintillating contest .			0

@entity1 hooker @entity0 was sent off in the 17th minute
@entity0 had elbowed @entity18 centre @entity70 in the face
referee @entity29 then showed a red cart to the @entity64 *frontrower*
@entity18 scored through @entity37 ( two ) and a penalty try
@entity1 replied through @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity131
@entity5 centre @entity89 claimed the @entity192 award
