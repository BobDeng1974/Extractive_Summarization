@entity0 had lost the ' hunger ' instilled by @entity2 under @entity3 , according to new manager @entity4			1
new @entity0 boss @entity4 has quizzed both @entity5 predecessors @entity6 and @entity3 on his south @entity8 survival bid			1
the former @entity10 boss hailed @entity11 for finishing 11th in the league last term , before conceding @entity3 suffered second - season syndrome when he took the helm in august			1
@entity4 has called on his side to replicate the hunger they had previously shown under @entity2 @entity0 finished 11th in the @entity8 last season thanks to the help of former boss @entity2 ' i think last year they were hungry and that hunger came out in that run that took them 11th , ' said @entity4			1
' the second year sometimes is a bit more dangerous because that hunger just goes off a bit			0
' and if there 's one thing i want to put back into that group it 's that hunger			0
' i think they 've been missing that a little bit , that hunger they had last year			0
' once the hunger goes out a little , it 's difficult to reignite that			0
' former @entity39 boss @entity2 walked out on @entity11 on the eve of the season after rowing with @entity0 chairman @entity42 over transfer targets			1
@entity44 manager @entity3 came out of retirement to plug @entity11 's gap in august , but was sacked in december after a run of one win in 11 games			1
@entity3 ( left ) was sacked after failing to get the best out of his players @entity4 guided @entity11 to a 2 - 1 home win over @entity53 in his first @entity8 game at the @entity5 helm , with his side facing @entity57 at @entity58 on saturday			1
the former @entity11 midfielder admitted sympathy with @entity3 's position , having to fight to restore the spark @entity2 lit at the club			1
' i always worry about a team in the second year , wherever they are , i always think it 's a little bit more difficult for the manager when you 've had it one year , ' said @entity4			2
' we showed a little bit of that hunger against @entity53 and hopefully we can keep that going moving forward now too			0
' @entity4 suffered relegation from the @entity8 as @entity77 manager , but managed to steer @entity10 away from a basement scrap in his first season on @entity80			2
the @entity0 go into their league match against @entity57 on the back of a 2 - 1 win against @entity53 the 53 - year - old believes those two experiences will steel him for the challenge of keeping @entity11 in the @entity8 this term			1
' the biggest learning curve i had was my first year at @entity10 , ' said @entity4			2
' we were not too far away from the bottom and we sold @entity92 for Â£ 30million and i did n't get a replacement			0
' that was one of my biggest achievements i think as a manager			0
' the pressure we were under , it was only our first year in the @entity8 , and i would say i think we played above ourselves that year , to finish without really having ourselves in any pressure situation			0
' we always kept ourselves out of it and if there 's one hope i 've got for @entity0 it 's that we can do that			2
' if we can get a couple of quick wins in the next three or four we can give ourselves a bit of breathing space and try to stay away			0
because once you 're down the bottom it 's very , very difficult			0
