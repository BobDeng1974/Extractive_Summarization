but they are not your typical @entity84 entrepreneurs			2
@entity86 came to them late			2
the pair were well over 30 when they launched their messaging app in 2009			2
the duo stand out in @entity84 for their unusual approach			2
they both hate advertising and have paid for almost no marketing to make the five - year - old app a success			2

in september 2007 @entity70 and @entity101 finally left @entity121			0
they both applied to @entity0 and were rejected			1
instead they decided to set up their own venture , @entity1 , now sold to @entity0 for billions			1
according to reports , the success of @entity1 has n’t changed @entity70 or @entity101			0

the deal is the latest aquisition for @entity0 , which last year bought @entity34			1
it also reportedly offered to pay close to $ 3 billion or more to acquire messaging service @entity189 , though that offer was spurned by the site 's founders			1

professor @entity222 from the @entity223 ( @entity223 ) said : ' obviously @entity1 adds instant messaging to @entity0 which must strengthen their position for the moment			1
' equally , all app types rise and fade , so established social media formats like @entity0 will be overtaken by something new , and picking up candidates that might have ultimately replaced them may be a good survival strategy for a while			1
' this does show the growing significance of mobile , though of course @entity0 is on mobile anyway			1
' but , @entity0 has been around a while now so the real question is what comes next ? '			1
