a group of astronauts have reached a landmark in their space mission by spending the longest amount of time in isolation			1
the @entity7 crew , however , is so far from the red planet that it is still in a car park in @entity11			1
they have now spent 438 days with limited contact with their friends and family - long enough for them to have made 73 return trips to the moon			2
the cosmonauts still have 82 days left of their 520 - day mission when they will enter the record books again ... for the shortest distance travelled			1
the crew has to make the most of the space they have on the 520 - day mission the crew was seen ' landing on @entity28 ' after 257 days in the capsule before their return journey to @entity32 they are part of an experiment to see what happens psychologically and physically during long - distance space flight in a simulated mission to @entity28			1
the experiment is taking place outside the @entity40 in a 550 cubic metre windowless space			2
a final kiss : the crew has had limited contact with family and friends over the last 14 months @entity47 , the holder of the real space endurance record of 437 days , told the @entity50 that it would be better for those ' on board ' to concentrate on the future			1
' @entity55 now not to count how much time has passed , but how much remains , ' he said			0
' it has a positive effect			0
he spent his time on the @entity62 orbiting @entity32 in 2005			0
three of the astronauts left the craft around half way through the mission to simulate going onto @entity28			1
@entity69 @entity68 , @entity71 @entity70 and @entity73 trainee @entity72 spent two days ' researching the planet ' before getting back on board for the return flight			0
like a reality television show , or even the 1978 movie @entity79 , the astronauts are observed by behavioural specialists at all times			0
their mission aims to help real space crews in the future cope with the confinement and stress of interplanetary travel			1
the crew members communicate with the outside world via e-mails and video messages - occasionally delayed to give them the feel of being more than a few yards away from mission control			1
they eat canned food similar to that eaten on the @entity97 and ' shower ' only once a week - in a hot room like a sauna , wiping themselves with tissues			2
it contains six tiny sleeping pods with cot - like beds , a living room , a eat - in kitchen , a working zone , a toilet , a laboratory and greenhouse			0
the men in the crew have entertained themselves by swapping different cultural festivals such as @entity115 the isolation facility measures about 550 cubic metres and is based in a car park in @entity11 none of the men have considered abandoning the mission , although they are free to walk out at any time , mission director and former cosmonaut @entity121 said at the half - way point			1
' they are still motivated , but there is a certain fatigue , which is natural , â€™ he said			0
' it will be very tough on the boys because of the monotony			0
' the fatigue and the thought that the mission is over can be fraught with negative consequences			0
' the @entity7 experiment is being conducted by the @entity11 - based @entity135 , the @entity136 and @entity73 's space training centre			1
in an effort to reproduce the conditions of space travel , with the exception of weightlessness , the crew has living quarters the size of a bus connected with several other modules for experiments and exercise			2
a separate built - in imitator of the @entity28 's surface is attached for the mock landing			0
the crew is made up of @entity155 @entity154 , 31 , and @entity71 - @entity156 @entity70 , 27 , who are engineers by training			2
@entity73 's @entity72 , 26 , is an employee at @entity73 's space training centre .			0

the @entity7 crew will also break the record for the shortest distance travelled on a space mission - not having left the @entity11 car park where they are based
