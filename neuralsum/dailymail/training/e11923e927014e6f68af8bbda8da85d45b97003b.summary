it is 20 years since @entity1 first published its @entity3 list marking the cultural shift in @entity6 life away from an industrial economy to one more centered around technology and entertainment			2
eagerly anticipated and now required reading , the list of 93 marks out those firmly in charge of shaping the current zeitgeist , ' @entity16 ' and those who threaten to break into this exclusive club , ' the @entity19 '			2
both lists are dominated by white men , with 30 billionaires and 36 new entries , with news moguls such as @entity25 and @entity26 firmly entrenched inside the top ten			2
top dogs : @entity25 topped @entity1 's ' @entity16 ' top 25 while @entity30 visionary , @entity31 ( right ) was named number one in ' the @entity19 ' list in the magazine 's annual ' @entity3 ' list indeed , @entity25 has been the only constant member of the ' @entity16 ' list since its inception , with newcomer and @entity40 's resident visionary , @entity31 topping out the ' @entity19 '			1
tech - giants dominate the ' @entity19 ' , with @entity43 's @entity42 and @entity44 at number two , and @entity47 's @entity46 and @entity49 design guru @entity48 at number three			0
@entity52 's 30 - year - old @entity51 is at five with @entity54 's 32 - year - old chief @entity53 topping out a top ten entirely comprised of men			0
the first of only five women in a list of 50 ' @entity19 ' is @entity51 's chief financial officer at @entity52 , @entity60			1
number two : @entity43 's @entity42 and @entity44 , both 41 , stay at number two in @entity1 's list of @entity19 @entity19 : @entity47 ceo and design guru @entity48 ( right ) placed at number three on the list of those disrupting the current establishment highest women : @entity52 's @entity60 ( left ) comes in at 12 on the disrupters list while @entity72 's @entity71 hits the list at 15 she is joined by @entity72 chief @entity71 in the top twenty at 15 along with @entity75 , who replaced @entity77 chief , @entity76 , in february			1
comedian @entity78 comes in at number 24 on the disrupters list from @entity1 in a top 50 full of the chiefs of the new establishment such as @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88 , there is room for only one @entity6 , the comedian , @entity78			1
while the @entity1 ' @entity19 ' list reflects poorly on diversity of those hoping to break into the culutral movers and shakers , it is not necessarily reflected in its more robust ' @entity16 ' roll call			1
while @entity25 and @entity26 sit at number one and four respectively , music giants @entity97 and her husband @entity99 both come in at joint number five - boosted by $ 100 worth of ticket sales for their recent joint tour , but chastened by rumors surrounding the health of their marriage			0
last year , the power - couple topped the list , but ugly surveillance footage of @entity97 's sister @entity109 attacking @entity99 inside a @entity111 elevator earlier this summer has taken the shine off their glossy united front			0
former number 1 's : @entity97 and her husband @entity99 appear at number five on the list of ' @entity118 ' - but last year they were at the top of that list entertainment and media moguls : @entity26 drops from two to four on the list of powers that be , while embattled @entity127 commissioner @entity126 makes an appearance at number eight this year embattled @entity127 commissioner @entity126 also makes the powerful list , coming in at number eight , although it remains to be seen whether he will be there next year as the league 's handling of the @entity137 affair is rapidly spiraling out of his control			1
the top ten also includes potential 2016 presidential hopeful @entity140 , who comes in at number nine after not featuring the previous year at all			0
she will surely only rise up @entity1 's list if , as expected , she confirms she will be running for president - a decision she has promised to make before january 1 , 2015			1
late night hosts : @entity146 , @entity147 and @entity148 made number 15 on the list of movers and shakers on the @entity153 ' new entry : @entity140 is ranked number nine on the list of ' @entity118 ' alongside @entity157 at six - and will surely rise during the year the other women in the top @entity159 ' are @entity160 , at 14 and @entity162 show runner , @entity163 at 18			2
at joint number 15 are the future late night triumvirate of @entity148			0
when @entity148 was announced as the replacement for @entity169 's long - serving @entity168 on the @entity170 , many bemoaned the lack of diversity on the nation 's television sets at that prestigious time - slot			0
fresh from the $ 3 billion sale of his beats music subscription and headphone company , dr. @entity176 is the first and highest @entity6 on the list at number 12 , joined in the top 25 by @entity183 at 22 and @entity184 at 20			0
