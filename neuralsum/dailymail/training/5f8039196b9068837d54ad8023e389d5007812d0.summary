by @entity0 published : 07:31 est , 8 march 2013 updated : 10:52 est , 8 march 2013 the mayor of @entity3 plans to build a ' @entity4 for the bike ' as part of an ambitious £ 900m plan to build a huge cycle path through the capital			1
the segregated route will run for more than 15 miles from the western suburbs through the heart of @entity3 to @entity13 and @entity14			1
it will use new @entity17 - style segregated cycle tracks along , among other places , the @entity19 and the @entity21 flyover			1
he said he wanted to overhaul the image that cycling is just for @entity37 - clad enthusiasts , and wanted bikes to reclaim the city 's streets			1
yesterday the mayor announced that the main @entity43 physical legacy of the @entity44 will be a proper network of cycle routes across the city			1
over the next four years @entity3 will open a range of high - quality new cycle routes parallel to , and named after , tube lines and bus routes , so everyone knows where they go			2
the red line shows the new cycle route that would travel through @entity3 and transform the way people get around the city the mayor added : ' i want to @entity62 cycling			1
i want to make it normal , something for everyone , something you feel comfortable doing in your ordinary clothes			0
' our new routes will give people the confidence to get in the saddle			2
' i do not promise perfection , or that @entity3 will become @entity76 any time soon			0
' the mayor said that cycling would reduce traffic , make the city a greener , more pleasant place and save lives			1
' the reason i am spending almost £ 1 billion on this is my belief that helping cycling will not just help cyclists			0
it will create better places for everyone			0
' it means less traffic , more trees , more places to sit and eat a sandwich			0
' it means more seats on the @entity97 , less competition for a parking place and fewer cars in front of yours at the lights			0
the cycling ' @entity4 ' would run past the @entity19 and travel from east to west through the capital the @entity108 's @entity107 warned that without adequate funding targets would not be reached the number of people using cycle lanes in central @entity3 has risen by 155 per cent , the @entity108 said @entity23 wants novices to take to the street s on bike ' above all , it will fulfill my aim of making @entity3 ’s air cleaner			1
if just 14 per cent of journeys in central @entity3 were cycled , emissions there of the greatest vehicle pollutant , @entity123 , would fall by almost a third and over the years literally thousands of lives could be saved			0
' despite the mayor 's grand plans , there are concerns that there might be inadequate funding			2
the @entity108 's @entity107 warned that without adequate funding targets would not be reached and the plan could fall woefully short of its expectations			2
the @entity107 called on the mayor to double @entity137 's budget for cycling , to tackle the recent rise in cycling injuries , which have seen a 50 per cent increase in @entity3 since 2006			2
@entity137 confirmed £ 913 million will be spent in the capital over a decade , but the @entity107 claimed that this is insufficient and , per year , only matches the budget provided for cycling in 2010			2
@entity3 experienced a 155 per cent increase in people cycling to work over the past decade , so the @entity107 welcomed the mayor 's vision for cycling			1
@entity150 , chair of the @entity108 ’s @entity107 , said : ' far from seeing evidence of a serious commitment to a " cycling revolution " , the mayor ’s vision lacks ambition for his pledges to make @entity3 safer and more inviting for cycling			1
' while £ 913 million may seem an impressive figure , its impact will be diluted over ten years and is not a significant advancement on current funding levels			0
to have real impact , we ’re calling for the investment in cycling to be doubled			0
' the plan includes major and substantial improvements to the worst junctions , making them safer and less threatening for cyclists with measures such as segregation and cycle - only paths or phases			1
junctions to be tackled in the next three years include @entity179 , @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity182 , and @entity183			0
the budget for @entity137 ’s safer junction review has been more than quintupled , from £ 19 million to £ 100 million , and the money will be focused on fewer sites			0
other elements in the ' mayor 's @entity190 ' include : the overall budget for cycling will rise to £ 913 million , two and a half times more than previously planned , with almost £ 400 million spent in the next three years alone			2
cycle spending will rise to £ 145 million in 2015 , or around £ 18 per head , up with the best in @entity196 and almost on a par with the @entity17			0
@entity137 is conducting off - site trials of new , cyclist - friendly innovations , such as ' @entity17 - style ' roundabouts and eye - level traffic lights for cyclists			1
if these trials are successful , and the @entity204 allows , they will be rolled out on the road network .			0

mayor promises millions of *pounds* for *scheme* to get novices cycling
segregated lane will ' slash traffic , reduce pollution and make city cleaner '
@entity216 will run from the east to the west of the capital
*critics* welcome plan but warn more funding is needed

a new network of ' @entity233 ' *–* direct , *continuous* , fully - *signposted* routes on *peaceful* side streets , running far into the suburbs , and aimed at people put off by cycling in traffic ;
substantial improvements to both existing and proposed *superhighways* , including some *reroutings* ;
a new ' @entity245 ' of bike routes in the @entity247 and @entity248 , using segregation , quiet streets , and two - way cycling on one - way traffic streets , to join all the other routes together .
