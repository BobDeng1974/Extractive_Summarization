@entity0 was left with cuts to her nose and chin after a mistletoe drone crashed into her face during a launch event at @entity7 's it was supposed to provide the perfect festive romantic moment : a mistletoe drone that would get diners at @entity7 's to kiss on camera			1
but the restaurant 's plan to lure in festive diners went horribly wrong after one of the machines smashed into a photographer 's face at a launch event in @entity21			1
@entity0 was left in shock after the machine flew into her face , slicing off the tip of her nose and cutting open a section of her lip			1
the ten - inch drone became so entangled in miss @entity30 's hair that she even feared she would lose an eye			1
the incident took place as @entity35 and other journalists gathered at the @entity38 restaurant to witness the four - bladed drones embark on their maiden flight			0
miss @entity0 told @entity41 : ' if that would 've hit me in my eye , i would n't be working tomorrow			1
' if this thing continued to spin , it would 've taken my eye out without a doubt			1
' the drama unfolded after the photojournalist arrived at the restaurant to take a photo of a couple kissing beneath the remote - controlled helicopter			2
miss @entity0 admitted she had been uncomfortable with the set - up from the start - particularly when she realised the shoot would take place inside the establishment			0
she told the @entity59 that she felt ' uneasy ' that the drone could interfere with or hurt the kissing couple while it was hovering over them			2
but miss @entity0 got to work , managing to successfully take photos of the couple kissing beneath the larger of the two drones			2
after that , pilot @entity67 decided to show reporter @entity69 from the @entity70 - another journalist invited to the launch - how the drone could land on her hand			1
but something went wrong when the reporter ' flinched ' - causing the drone to ' fly into ' miss @entity0 's face			1
she said : ' it kind of landed , but it did something to her hand - i do n't know whether it was buzzing or what - but she flinched			2
' and when she flinched - i was standing maybe a foot away from her - and this smaller toy drone for children flies into my face at that point			1
' a wire from the craft became entangled in miss @entity30 's hair as she sat with other reporters to see the drones take their first flight a photographer has been injured by one of @entity7 's mistletoe drones after it lost control and hit her in the face , leaving her with cuts on her nose and lip ( file image ) the photographer told how the fishing wire , which was used to connect the mistletoe to the drone , became trapped in her hair			1
it then began ' twirling and twirling and twirling ' on her nose as miss @entity0 attempted to ' shoo it away ' , eventually cutting her on the chin			0
miss @entity0 was soon able to remove the drone from her hair and grabbed tissues to stem the bleeding			2
but she claims mr @entity67 did not help her in her moment of turmoil - and did not even remove his hands from the controls			0
she claims he had even told @entity115 that the drone could not cut her , prompting her to put her finger to her nose and say : ' it just did '			0
after the crash , mr @entity67 blamed the accident on the reporter ' flinching ' when he tried to negotiate the craft 's landing			2
he also said that diners would not be put off by the accident , because everyone is well aware of the risks			0
according to the @entity70 , he said : ' if people get hurt , they 're going to come regardless			0
people get hurt in airplanes , they still fly			0
there is a risk involved - anything flying , there is risk			0
' after the accident the drone pilot blamed a fellow diner for the accident , saying she flinched when he tried to land it on her hand , which sent it careening into the woman 's face @entity7 friday 's was using two drones to romance diners when the accident took place - one small craft with four blades and a larger one with six uncovered propellers			1
the accident involved the smaller of the two			0
a spokesman for the restaurant chain said that events in @entity158 and @entity159 had passed without any bloodshed and tried to reassure diners that the risk of injury is low			0
@entity7 launched the drone gimmick after research revealed that 47 per cent of @entity166 have never enjoyed a kiss under the mistletoe			1
the study also found that just 27 percent of people were planning to lock lips with someone under the festive plant this year - something the restaurant hopes to change			0
pilot @entity67 said he did n't think the crash would put diners off coming to the restaurant , adding : ' people get hurt in airplanes , they still fly			2
there is a risk involved - anything flying , there is risk ' the drone , which can fly at speeds of up to 35mph usually hovers around 8ft above couples , before swooping in for the kiss			2
' everyone loves a good @entity191 party , but we all know things can be a bit awkward until someone breaks the ice , ' said @entity7 marketing manager @entity197 of the drone 's uses			1
' we wanted to see how we could make @entity191 get - together in our restaurants even more entertaining			0
' we offered guests the encouragement they need to make their move			0
' our mistletoe drones are the perfect way to do this			0
not only are they great fun for the entire restaurant , but they help people get a little closer at this romantic time of the year			0
' maybe we 'll have had our first mistletoe drone wedding by this time next year			1
' a spokesman for @entity7 's said launch events in @entity158 and @entity159 had passed without any bloodshed , and tried to reassure customers that the risk of injury is low			1
