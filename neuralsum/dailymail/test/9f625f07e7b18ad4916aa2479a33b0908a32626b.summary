this year 's election has bought with it a bizarre batch of merchandise in a bid to sway the nation			1
perhaps dad might like an @entity33 decanter for his wine , or mum could bake in her new set of conservative cupcake cases , while @entity11 have focused on a more wearable range of accessories			2

' for men who do n't quite know whether they dress to the right or left			0

varieties include @entity9 's @entity176 , a strawberry and meringue flavour inspired by the @entity179 's old school			1
@entity181 's @entity180 is based on the seaside treat of teeth - cracking rock as ' being leader of the opposition is often described as the worst job in @entity187 politics , so where better to escape to for a break than the great @entity187 seaside , famous not just for being a great holiday destination but also for hosting many party political conferences			1
