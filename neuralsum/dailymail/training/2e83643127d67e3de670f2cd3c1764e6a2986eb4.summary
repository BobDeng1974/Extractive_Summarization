but as it did , there was a loud screech and then the engine cut out			2
‘ the helicopter just dropped to the ground at speed ... it hit the bottom of the cliff that meets with the sea			1
it was the most horrific thing i have ever seen			0
’ greenkeeper @entity74 said : ‘ it started to splutter and sway , and i thought the pilot was trying to make a landing but it did n’t make it			0

' the @entity130 will be leading the investigation into the incident to establish the circumstances which resulted in the aircraft crashing into the sea			2
' again , members of public and the media are asked to avoid the area which is sealed off until further notice due to the site being close to dangerous cliff edges and there also being a quantity of what appears to be aviation fuel in the water around the crash site making it potentially unsafe at present			1
