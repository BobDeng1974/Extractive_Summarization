teachers demanded a 20 - hour a week limit on classes yesterday to maintain a healthy ‘ work / life balance ’			1
@entity5 members called for a rigid 35 - hour week , with little more than half given over to teaching children			1
five hours would be used for planning , preparation and assessment ‘ at a time and place of the teacher ’s choosing ’ – meaning at home in most cases			0
taking to the streets : a national union of teachers protest in @entity18 the remaining ten hours would be set aside for other ‘ non-contact ’ duties including marking and going to meetings			1
the proposal came at the end of a heated eight - day period during which annual conferences held by three teaching unions were used to repeatedly attack the policies of education secretary @entity28			1
the working hours motion of the @entity5 – which was passed by an overwhelming majority and will be linked to planned strikes over pay , pensions and conditions – would mean teachers taking classes for just four hours a day on average			1
many schools would have to hire extra staff , putting greater pressure on budgets			0
cutting teaching workloads is one of the demands in the current dispute with mr @entity28 that has led to a series of regional strikes from this summer , followed by a national strike before @entity49			1
the teachers complain that they spend too much time outside lessons marking and preparing for parents evenings , leaving them without time to have meetings or plan lessons critics were swift to accuse the union of being ‘ out of touch ’ with reality			2
@entity61 , a @entity62 mp on the @entity64 education select committee , said : ‘ you ca n’t change these things in the current economic climate			0
‘ it just shows how incredibly out of touch the unions are with what ’s going on in the real world			0
’ @entity73 , of the @entity74 , said teachers should have their hours ‘ expanded , not diminished ’			2
he added : ‘ in the independent sector it is normal to have 60 hours of contact time a week			2
they are living in fantasy land if they want 20 hours per week			1
’ he said the hours of work should be made less stressful by giving them greater powers to suspend or exclude disruptive pupils			0
the @entity5 saved its bombshell for the last motion of its five - day conference in @entity89			1
@entity91 primary school teacher @entity90 said : ‘ we ’re fed up with arriving at 7.45am ... and most people are there until 6.30pm			0
‘ during that time there is no time to go to eat , no time to talk , no time to think , no time even to go to the toilet in many cases			0
@entity98 , general secretary of the @entity5 , lead criticism of education secretary @entity28 who has faced calls to resign from most teaching unions ‘ then , after the day ’s work , what do you do when you get home ? do you relax ? i ’m sure you all know – another two , three , four hours of work			1
the number of emails you get after midnight , people sending each other plans , targets , data , things like that is incredible			0
’ teachers were sacrificing time with their own children , he said , adding : ‘ if you complain to management about that they say “ maybe teaching ’s not for you then ”			1
’ @entity121 from @entity122 in @entity123 said : ‘ we will fight in all the ways we can to win a model contract which clearly defines the weekly limits on working hours for teachers			1
’ earlier in the day , delegates chanted : ‘ gove must go ’ as they passed a motion of no confidence in the @entity28			2
teachers are contracted to work 195 days every year , with five set aside for training			2
they typically spend 22.5 hours taking classes each week , meaning the proposal would significantly reduce contact time			0
but they complain contracts include a clause to carry out ‘ reasonable additional hours ’ , meaning they end up working longer			2
@entity143 delegate @entity142 said official figures showed secondary school teachers work 50.2 hours per week on average and primary school colleagues give 49.9 hours of their time			2
he added : ‘ it is essential that what is already @entity5 policy for a 35 - hour week becomes a reality			1
’ the @entity5 and @entity152 are holding a series of regional strikes followed by a national strike later this year over pay , pensions and conditions			0
some teachers are already operating on a work - to - rule basis			0
the working hours motion – during which teachers also called for smaller class sizes – is the latest point of friction between teachers and mr @entity28			1
they have also clashed with him over issues such as changes to the curriculum and the end of modular qualifications			0
the @entity174 said it was for schools to organise the hours and workloads of staff			0
a spokesman added : ‘ by scrapping unnecessary paperwork and bureaucracy we are making it easier than ever before for teachers to focus their efforts on teaching and learning			0

@entity5 demand 35 - hour limit on working week with 20 hours set aside for teaching children
delegates at conference in @entity89 complain that they are *over-worked*
teachers chant ' @entity28 must go ' and call for @entity28 to resign
