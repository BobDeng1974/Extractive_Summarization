by @entity0 , mail online deputy political editor sir @entity2 who has argued that the @entity3 should be handed wide - ranging powers in a bid to curb enthusiasm for the ' folly ' of full independence stopping @entity11 independence is more important than re-electing @entity12 to safeguard @entity14 's ' special relationship ' with the @entity15 , former @entity9 prime minister @entity2 has claimed			1
sir @entity2 said @entity11 independence would force @entity14 to give up its nuclear weapons - sparking a diplomatic crisis with @entity19			1
it would also increase demands for independence in @entity23 and @entity24 and diminish the @entity14 's influence in the world , sir @entity2 said			1
he claimed the 2015 general election was one of the most important since @entity29 was first elected - but pales in comparison to keeping the union together			1
the former @entity9 leader said ' i do n’t wish to disparage the importance of the 2015 general election at all – it is one of the more important elections we ’ve had in the last 30 years or so			1
but it is less important than maintaining the @entity14 as an entity			2
' he said : ' of course , one of the big implications of @entity11 becoming separate would be the @entity45 's threat to expel @entity46 from @entity47			2
sir @entity2 said this would ' in effect , be the end of the serious @entity14 nuclear deterrent '			1
sir @entity2 said ' you ca n't just move those subs , they need proper ports , they need proper facilities '			0
he added : ' you 're talking of many , many years before they would have them , by which time @entity46 may no longer be as relevant as it is now			0
and that affects not just us , that affects every @entity65 country and @entity66			0
' how will the @entity15 react when one of the only two countries with a credible military and nuclear capability suddenly has the nuclear capability effectively wrecked ? ' this affects the @entity14			1
there are long - term , strategic questions for the whole of the @entity14 that depend upon the result of this referendum			2
' yesterday , sir @entity2 said : ' @entity15 would not forgive - nor forget - this , and yet the separatists assume membership of @entity66 is almost a given			1
trust me , it is far from that			0
' the former prime minister said the @entity14 can not be ‘ broken apart without damaging repercussions for @entity88 , @entity23 and @entity24 – some unforeseen , some unforeseeable ’			2
he said : ' if @entity11 were to become a separate country that would have serious implications , i believe , for @entity11 , and negative implications			0
' but it would also have very negative implications for the rest of the @entity14 as well			0
' if , for example , you see a country begin to fracture , does it have greater or lesser influence over its international bodies , in the @entity102 , in the @entity103 , in the @entity104 , in any of the international groupings ? self - evidently they have less			0
' if you have @entity11 deciding to be independent , what does that actually do inside the rest of the @entity14 ? ' does that inflame a greater independence demand in @entity23 , for example , and it has implications in every part of the @entity14			1
@entity117 's hopes of winning the september 18 referendum hinge on convincing undecided voters to back independence			0
among those certain to vote the ' no ' campaign currently enjoys a 20 per cent lead sir @entity2 , now 71 , also accused @entity117 of trying to capitalise on ‘ anti-english sentiment ’ and the anniversary of the @entity127 ahead of september ’s independence referendum			1
in his first key intervention in the debate over @entity11 ’s future , the former prime minister said he was ‘ sad ’ the 700th anniversary of @entity135 ’s famous victory over the @entity88 will be commemorated just months before voters go to the polls			0
the @entity139 leader said @entity88 voices should be ‘ heard with respect , and without the petulant name - calling that has been the response to some @entity88 interventions during this campaign so far ’			0
sir @entity2 added : ' we were at war centuries ago , which – if i may be brutally frank – i find it rather sad that the @entity45 chose the anniversary of the @entity127 for the vote , presumably to maximise the opportunity for any anti-english sentiment that may exist			2
' the @entity127 commemorations take place next week , around 80 days before @entity11 go to the polls			0
sir @entity2 claimed @entity11 would go from having ‘ real influence ’ as part of the @entity14 to ‘ irrelevance ’ as a small nation if people vote ‘ yes ’ on september 18			1
he accused @entity117 of trying to capitalise on ‘ anti-english sentiment ’ , and called on him to crack down on @entity164 ‘ trolls ’ abusing people on @entity166 for supporting the @entity102			0
as prime minister sir @entity2 blocked demands in @entity11 for devolution over fears it would be used as a ' stepping stone ' to independence			2
ironically the @entity45 leader @entity117 ( sat with sir @entity2 last year ) was also against devolution - because he believed it would stop voters pushing for independence sir @entity2 , also rubbished mr @entity117 ’s claims that an independent @entity11 could join the @entity102 , calling it ‘ fatuous ’ and said it could require years of painstaking negotiations and concessions			1
after @entity185 author @entity184 was subjected to vile online abuse for giving money to the @entity188 campaign : sir @entity2 said : ‘ if @entity117 can not control these people , and perhaps he ca n’t , then he can at least disown them			0
’ last night , @entity45 msp @entity192 said : ‘ @entity2 is just about the last person the no campaign will have wanted to see entering the debate here , given his track record in ensuring a @entity9 wipe - out in @entity11 in 1997			2

@entity2 says independence referendum more important than general election
claims @entity14 would lose nuclear weapons if @entity11 leaves the @entity14
says this would spark a crisis with the @entity15 and @entity66 over *defence* ties
former *pm* claims ' yes ' vote would also boost independence calls in @entity23
