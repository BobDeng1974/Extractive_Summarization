by @entity0 published : 08:09 est , 8 january 2014 updated : 12:34 est , 8 january 2014 life on @entity3 does n't seem so alien now that a team of scientists have set up a @entity3 camp in a @entity8 desert			1
a team of experts have recreated life on the red planet by dressing up in space suits and living in isolation on a rocky desert in @entity16			1
the researchers from the @entity18 live at a simulated base , surviving on food rations , conducting research experiments and showering just once every three days			1
@entity3 comes to @entity22 : a team of enthusiastic scientists are dressing in space suits and recreating life on @entity3 - in a red desert on @entity22 every time the team of four men and two women leave the @entity32 they pass through an air lock			1
the cramped , two - storey hut is situated 40 miles from @entity35 , with the crew sleeping in small , coffin - like beds			1
the surrounding area slightly resembles geological and environmental conditions on @entity3 , in that it is hot , windy , largely red , and rocky			2
researchers from the @entity18 live at a simulated @entity3 base , built with the help of space agency @entity44 the crew survive on food rations , conduct research experiments , and shower just once every three days a @entity50 student was recently shortlisted for the job of repopulating the human race - on @entity3			1
@entity53 , 20 , beat more than 200,000 hopefuls to reach the final stages of selection for a one - way mission			0
the contest was part of the ' @entity61 ' project to establish a self - sustaining colony			0
it would see four people - two men and two women - take a five year flight into space			0
mr @entity53 is now on the shortlist to join the first programme on @entity3 - which is 57 million miles away from @entity22			2
the @entity61 project was founded by @entity71 entrepreneurs @entity72 and @entity61 , and aims to establish a permanent base on the planet by 2025			0
an initial appeal for volunteers last year gathered more than 200,000 responses			0
contact with the outside world is strictly limited , with a very slow internet connection restricted to allow just a few emails in and out each day			0
most communication is with ' mission control ' , who ask the crew for reports on every aspect of their lives during their two - week shifts			1
that includes details on their food intake , exercise , and psychological status			0
visitors have to travel to the @entity32 on a buggy , down an unmarked path littered with boulders , at a speed of just 5mph			0
mission commander @entity100 , 27 , who works as a @entity44 biologist , said : ' we have to go through an airlock procedure and suit up before we have any contact with the outside			0
' everything we do each day must be as if we were on another planet			0
' i 'd like to be the first person to set foot on @entity3 but the first people up there will be engineers			2
you need to be able to fix things as they break			0
' but i am a trained biologist , so maybe i 'll be the first person to discover life on @entity3			2
' the rest of the crew are all from science backgrounds , and realise two weeks at the base does not guarantee them a space on the first flight			0
most communication is with ' mission control ' , who ask the crew for reports on every aspect of their lives during their two - week shifts this image shows the food the team eat			1
the experiments are designed to help scientists learn more about what astronauts would endure on such a journey one crew member said : ' in a way , it 's great fun			1
' you 're miles from anywhere and you get to put on space suits and pretend you 're on a different planet			0
who would n't enjoy that ? ' it 's like a childhood dream come true			0
' the suits worn by the scientists come with their own air - conditioning , radio units , heavy helmets , and boots			2
every time the team of four men and two women leave the @entity32 they must pass through an air lock a team of enthusiastic scientists are dressing in space suits and recreating life on @entity3 - in a rocky scientists predict it will be 20 years before humans set foot on the planet , and those at the @entity32 hope to be on that flight			1
pictured is the simulated @entity3 base the two - storey hut is situated 40 miles from @entity35 in @entity16 scientists predict it will be 20 years before humans set foot on the planet , and those at the @entity32 hope to be on that flight			1
they estimate the cost of the initial @entity3 landing to be £ 3.67billion , and every subsequent manned mission £ 2.45billion			2
any crew that survives the journey will have to remain there for at least a year and a half , waiting for @entity3 and @entity22 to align properly for the trip back			1
during this time , they will supply their own oxygen , power , food , and water			0
the experiments being conducted at the @entity32 and a sister station in the @entity196 are designed to help scientists learn more about what astronauts would endure on such a trip			1
the shortest possible journey to @entity3 is 140 million miles , a trip that is thought to take around seven months			2
mission commander @entity100 , 27 , who works as a @entity44 biologist , said : ' everything we do each day must be as if we were on another planet ' any crew that survives the journey to @entity3 will have to remain there for at least a year and a half , waiting for @entity3 and @entity22 to align properly for the trip back			1

researchers from the @entity18 are living in a cramped two - story hut
they survive on rations , conduct experiments and shower every 3 days
crew must report on every aspect of their lives during their two - week shifts
experiments in @entity16 , and on a sister station in the @entity196 , are designed to help scientists learn about what astronauts would endure on a trip to @entity3
