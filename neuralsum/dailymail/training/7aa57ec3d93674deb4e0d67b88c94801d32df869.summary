one of @entity3 ’s biggest rural police forces will run out of cash to fight crime and protect the public within three years , its chief constable has warned			1
@entity7 claimed @entity8 will effectively go out of business if the latest round of cuts takes place			1
he said the force would be ‘ unsustainable ’ by 2018 , with a shortfall of £ 10.4million , meaning a fifth of frontline officers would have to be axed			1
warning : @entity7 , who leads @entity8 , ( left ) has warned home secretary @entity17 ( right ) that his force will collapse within three years unless it gets more cash in a letter to home secretary @entity17 , he said he would have to scrap neighbourhood policing , with bobbies on the beat replaced by ‘ just a few ’ community support officers			1
response times to 999 calls would rise and the ‘ range of offences where a meaningful investigation will be possible will reduce ’ , mr @entity7 added			2
crimes such as theft would have to be largely ignored , and investigations into historic sex abuse and cyber-crime could not be pursued			0
the officer , who has more than 28 years ’ experience , said he would not have spare staff to help at major events or emergencies outside his area			0
‘ if we were a business , then it would be being funded at below the cost of being in business , ’ he said			0
‘ the cupboard is bare and it is likely that we will be the first force in the country to fall over			1
’ last month @entity50 warned the ability of six forces , including @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 , to provide an effective service would be at risk after cuts left a ‘ very thin blue line ’			0
@entity8 is particularly vulnerable as it covers the third largest area in @entity61 and @entity62 – 2,292 square miles – and has one of the smallest forces , due to the county ’s few cities and relatively low population			2
support : mr @entity7 also said his officers would no longer be able to travel the country to support others during major events or emergencies , such as the @entity74 or @entity75 riots it has the third highest number of crimes per officer			1
the force has already cut 1,220 officers to 1,100 , but mr @entity7 said a further 236 frontline staff would have to go			1
@entity8 has been criticised in the past for the way it spends money			2
in 2008 bonuses of £ 40,000 were shared between three chiefs when the force was rated one of the worst in the country			1
blundering officers who put the wrong fuel into police cars ran up a £ 10,000 repair bill in 2009			0
and in may this year , the @entity96 attacked the force ’s plan to spend £ 600,000 recruiting 1,000 ‘ volunteers ’ , saying the cash would be better spent hiring 25 frontline officers			2
but mr @entity7 claims costs have already been reduced by collaborating with other forces and outsourcing non-frontline roles to private firms such as @entity106			1
‘ in 2016 - 17 @entity8 will be … on the edge of viability , ’ he wrote			0
‘ in the following year it will be unsustainable			0
to cut officer numbers by the amount needed would … compromise both public safety and officer safety			1
’ last year , @entity50 said it had ‘ concerns ’ about the force ’s ability to maintain services after ‘ significant ’ budget cuts from 2015/16 with ‘ one of the lowest spends on policing , small workforce numbers , low costs and limited further opportunities for economies of scale			2
’ yesterday @entity126 , the area ’s police and crime commissioner , said : ‘ my chief constable tells me that on an average saturday night at 11pm , he has only 18 constables available to deploy in the city of @entity132 , and only ten in @entity133			0
’ the government announced a 20 per cent cut in police funding in 2010			0
the number of officers fell from 141,600 at the general election to 125,400 in march .			0
