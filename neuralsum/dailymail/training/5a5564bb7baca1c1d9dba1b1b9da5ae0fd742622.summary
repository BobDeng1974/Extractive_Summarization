by @entity0 secrets : the @entity3 report can not be published until the issue of documents sent between @entity6 and @entity7 have been resolved by the involved parties @entity6 was blamed yesterday for a delay in publishing an official report into the @entity11			1
@entity12 , a @entity13 minister , accused the former premier of trying to block the release of secret communications between him and @entity7			1
he has told sir @entity18 , who is heading the inquiry , of his deep concern at the length of time it is taking			1
a letter from the former @entity25 mandarin – seen by the @entity26 – shows that publication of notes sent by mr @entity6 to former @entity29 president @entity7 , and records of their conversations , is an issue			2
' we continue to work toward delivering our report to the prime minister at the earliest possible date , ’ he told mr @entity37 , adding that discussions ‘ about the disclosure of sensitive documents are not yet concluded ’			1
mr @entity37 said he was dismayed by sir @entity18 ’s confirmation that mr @entity6 ’s messages to the @entity44 are causing a delay			1
‘ the way the @entity6 government handled the @entity3 war is perhaps the most shameful episode in the history of our democracy , ’ he said			2
‘ the fact @entity6 appears now to be holding up the proper release of information is a disgrace			2
‘ we need the @entity58 inquiry report now – we need it out before the general election			0
‘ voters are entitled to know what was done in their name			0
@entity6 should stop blocking the release of this information and sir @entity18 should not allow the timetable in his inquiry to be dictated by the former prime minister			1
’ @entity68 said last year he hoped the difficulties surrounding publication of the conclusions would be ‘ concluded as soon as possible ’			0
but the declassification of key documents - and the process that requires individuals criticised in a government - commissioned report to have a chance to comment - remain stalled			2
in a letter to sir @entity18 , mr @entity37 said he was ‘ very concerned that your final conclusions have yet to see the light of day ’ and pointed out that it was ‘ more than a decade since the @entity3 war occurred and therefore operational sensitivities must be long gone ’			1
he added : ‘ given the huge controversy of the episode in @entity89 life , i think it is very important that all the facts are now made public and the potential for individual embarrassment should not be allowed to get in the way of this objective			0
’ the details of the decision to go to war have not been aired more than a decade after thousands protested mr @entity37 asked if it was true , as has been claimed , that the delay centered around the release of correspondence between mr @entity6 and mr @entity7			2
sir @entity18 said he was ‘ able to confirm that the sensitive documents under discussion include notes send by mr @entity6 to president @entity7 , and records of conversations between the @entity89 prime minister and the @entity111 ... i regret that i am unable to answer your question about the involvement of the former prime minister ... ’ @entity116 asked sir @entity18 to investigate the conflict in 2009 and he last took evidence from a witness three years ago			1
@entity121 defence minister @entity120 warned last week that the report will not be ‘ very kind ’ to mr @entity6 , saying he was ‘ not clear why it has n’t been published already ’			0
mr @entity6 has firmly denied being responsible for the hold - up			0
‘ i ’ve made it absolutely clear that when the report ’s published is entirely up to them [ the inquiry team ]			0
' it ’s not my decision at all ... it ’s the responsibility of the people who run the inquiry , ’ he said			0
a spokesman said : ‘ he has as much reason as anyone for wanting the report published			0

sir @entity18 must wait for issue of ' sensitive documents ' to be resolved
@entity13 minister has accused former pm of ' disgrace to democracy '
@entity3 records have yet to be *revealed* almost a decade on from start of war
