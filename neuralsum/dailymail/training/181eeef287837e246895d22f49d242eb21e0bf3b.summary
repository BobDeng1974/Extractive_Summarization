the right reverend @entity17 , @entity18 , disputed the way the leading characters – more and his nemesis @entity28 – were portrayed			0
he said : ‘ it is an extraordinary and perverse achievement of @entity12 and @entity30 to make of @entity28 a flawed hero and of @entity6 , one of the greatest englishmen , a scheming villain			1
‘ it is not necessary to share @entity6 ’s faith to recognise his heroism – a man of his own time who remains an example of integrity for all times			1
’ he said it would be sad if @entity28 was held up as a hero for later generations , adding : ‘ we should remember @entity3 is a work of fiction			1

‘ those modern parallels need to be cautiously drawn , ’ said @entity57			1
‘ @entity12 does have this view that being a @entity64 is destructive to your humanity			1
‘ it is not historically accurate and it is not accurate in what the catholic faith has to contribute to society and to the common good			1

’ one of @entity80 ’s first acts when he was ordained @entity16 last year was to visit @entity81 in @entity82 to pray at more ’s hair shirt , which is kept by @entity85 monks there			2
‘ did more make mistakes ? ’ the bishop asked			1
does it mean he is not a saint ? no. @entity93 histories seem to recognise that			2
@entity3 is not presenting @entity28 through a neutral perspective			2
there is an anti-catholic element			0
