she and friend @entity20 have been sentenced to six years and seven months in prison @entity1 ’s father , @entity22 , 53 , said : ‘ we think the sentence is too harsh and does n’t sit with the crime			1
‘ they ’re first - time offenders and they did n’t instigate it			2
' the other people involved – the bigger players – must be watching all this			2
they must still not be able to sleep easy at night			2
’ the family are not appealing against the decision and are clinging to hopes that @entity1 may one day be transferred back to the @entity15 to serve part of her sentence			1
@entity35 , who is pictured after flying out to @entity12 to support her daughter claims that the sentence is too long mr @entity38 , from @entity39 , near @entity40 , added : ‘ this stigmatises @entity1 for the rest of her life			1
she ’s always going to be known as the drug mule			1
we ’re the drug mule ’s father and mother			1
that ’s what it will be for ever more			2
‘ @entity1 lost two grandparents this year before all this happened			2
she ’s got two elderly grandparents now – personally , i do n’t think she ’ll ever see them again			0

they originally claimed to have been kidnapped by a gang in @entity82 and forced to travel to @entity12 , but later accepted responsibility and pleaded guilty			1
mr @entity38 said : ‘ i thought it might bring some kind of closure but it ’s just opened up more issues and brought uncertainty			0
how long do they actually have to serve in @entity12 ? when can they be transferred to a @entity15 prison ? we ’ve been told different things by different people			1
’ happier times : @entity1 ( bottom left ) pictured with her mother @entity57 , and 18 - year - old twin sisters @entity98 ( top right ) and @entity101 ( bottom right ) mrs @entity1 , 53 , added : ‘ when you think of six years eight months , @entity1 is going to be 27 before the sentence is complete			1

it ’s when you settle down and meet your partner , have fun with friends			0
‘ i ’m trying to think she will still be a young woman when she ’s released and those things will happen for her but it ’s such a long time			0
we ’re hoping that she ’ll be out sooner			0
