by @entity1 reporter published : 01:19 est , 12 september 2013 updated : 14:31 est , 12 september 2013 the town of @entity4 , seen in images from the @entity6 , in central @entity2 was once a service stop for trains running from @entity9 to @entity10 on the @entity12 line , but it is now a ghost town			1
the last surviving resident of the town , which was founded in the 1892 in the picturesque @entity18 , a woman by the name of @entity21 , died in 2002 at the age of 99			1
now , the town stands as a testament to the changing face of @entity26 in the post industrial age			2
founded in 1892 , it had all but disappeared back into nature by the 2000s the way it was : an guard house in @entity4 is one of the few remaining buildings in the ghost @entity40 town along the picturesque @entity42 in central @entity2 , @entity4 once provided coal to steam trains haunting : pictured is the inside of one of the two remaining houses in @entity4			1
the ghost town saw its last resident die in 2002 just two houses remain standing in the town , which began its decline when trains in the region switched from steam to diesel			1
@entity4 was no longer needed as a ' helper station ' for refueling trains with coal			1
by the 1980s , the city of @entity63 , @entity2 passed legislation aimed at dissolving the town of @entity4 , which stood in @entity63 's watershed			1
breathtaking : the remnants of a warehouse decay ever further in @entity4 , an old railroad town situated in @entity18 in @entity2 preserved : inside one of @entity4 's two standing houses , an empty kitchen gathers dust and dirt but retains its bright red trim reclaimed : an old telegraph pole rots away like much of @entity4			1
few buildings remain in the town , and the ones that still stand are surrounded by such overgrowth lonely : a lone chair sits in a shower stall in the back of a guard house in @entity4			1
no one has lived in the town , much less sat in a chair there , since 2002 the residents were asked to leave and the town was nearly abandoned			2
that is , except for @entity21			0
@entity21 , a school teacher who once taught the children of @entity4 , refused to sell off her property and stayed in her home until it burned			0
after that , she moved into a cabin outside the town			0
train town : @entity4 was founded as the railroad industry began to boom in the @entity101			2
trains went silent in the town for decades and have only recently begin passing through once again no more : @entity4 's last resident @entity21 died in 2002 at the age of 99			1
she 'd tried and failed to preserve her town as an historical site an inside view of an abandoned warehouse			0
@entity4 once served as a helper town for the @entity101 railroad			2
trains would stop in the town and refuel this angle shows the only two houses left in @entity4			1
@entity21 's house burned down in the years before her death , forcing her to stay in a cabin just outside the town , but she refused to ever leave for good @entity21 tried and failed to turn her town 's remaining buildings into historical relics			0
she died at 99 in october of 2002			2
with all its residents gone , what was left of @entity4 when @entity21 died has decayed ever further			2
only two houses remain in the town , which has now been fenced off from automobile traffic , according to the @entity6			0
while trains have begun chugging through once again , the only way to actually reach the town is on foot			0
the odd traveler now happens by now and again to catch a glimpse of one of @entity26 's few true ghost towns before it inevitably vanishes			0
forgotten : an abandoned @entity138 melts into the dense forests of the @entity18			0
soon , there will be nothing left of @entity4 but memories and even those will fade pictured is the attic in the guard house			0
@entity4 's only road has been shut down and the town fenced off			1
it is now only accessible on foot inaccessible : dust and scattered trash covers the kitchen of a guard house in @entity4			0
the town is completely silent save for the occasional passing train now and no longer accessible by car or even bike			0

@entity4 , @entity2 's last living resident died in in 2002 at the age of 99
the town was once a fuel stop for trains but lost its usefulness when they stopped using coal
