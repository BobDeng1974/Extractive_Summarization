master of paper folding , @entity10 , shows off his amazing animal sculptures on the internet			1
from tiny bugs to mighty beasts , he boasts 131 pictures of his intricate designs and creations on his @entity20 account			0
most sculptures are based on the designs of others , such as this impressive king cobra by @entity25 detail : the close up photographs of each artwork let you appreciate the craftsmanship in each piece inspiration : @entity10 's green folded tree frog was based on a design by @entity35 some of @entity10 's creations are based on the designs of advanced origami masters such as @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity25			1
he replicates their models with his own paper folding technique , often adding a personal touch			2
he also has also produced original works which have formed part of an exhibition in @entity49 this year			0
a combination of soft contours , rather than harsh , straight edges , intricate craftsmanship and various colours of tissue paper make @entity10 's sculptures hyper - detailed and life - like			2
bought back to life : @entity58 , an extinct saber - toothed cat , designed by @entity39 , folded by @entity10 @entity60 : @entity61 , the most famous and largest of the rhinoceros beetles , design by @entity39 vibrant : the bright colours of the @entity66 warn off predators and this paper replica would certainly fool them the @entity70 art of paper folding , origami , was an ancient skill passed down the generations until in 1797 the first origami book was published containing instructions on mastering the technique			1
the word derives from the @entity70 words : ' ori ' ( folding ) and ' kami ' ( paper ) meaning paper			0
it quickly became popular outside of @entity86 and has since then evolved into a modern art form			1
the goal is to transform a flat sheet of paper into a finished sculpture through folding and sculpting techniques			0
cutting the paper or gluing it is not considered to be true origami			0
