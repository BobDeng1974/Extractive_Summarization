banana milkshakes in the pool with his wife and chess on the beach at sunset with his dad ... these are n't exactly the images that come to mind when asked to picture a getaway fit for rock ' n roll royalty			1
but that 's exactly how @entity17 , and now mcbusted , star , @entity16 , likes it			1
the drummer enjoyed a @entity21 break with wife of two years , @entity23 , and his parents , @entity25 and @entity26 , at @entity27 at @entity28 in @entity29 and shared his holiday snaps exclusively with @entity31			1
and while there are a host of outdoor pursuits to be enjoyed , sun , sand and good company were all the popstar really needed			1
' we 're the worst couple in the world for activities , ' @entity16 told @entity59			1
' my idea of a good time on holiday is lying about on the bed , on the beach , reading a book , maybe a round of golf - these are all of my requirements			2
and @entity23 's on the same page too			2
' the pair were regular , rather photogenic , fixtures poolside where @entity16 says they enjoyed virgin cocktails - ' usually a banana milkshake , before going back for some more reading			1
' while the words ' virgin cocktail ' can often see ears prick up about the potential pitter patter of tiny feet , this couple - who were married in december 2012 , insist that there 's nothing to share			2
they simply do n't drink			2
though there were plenty of activities to choose from , @entity16 admits that he and his wife prefer to lounge on the beach though the pair has no aversion to kids per se , the resort is adults only , which ensures peace and quiet for its guests			1
' meeting people is a big part of my job but it felt like there was hardly anyone there , ' @entity16 said			1
' it was so relaxing and quiet			2
it 's a luxury that just ca n't be underestimated			2
it was really nice to have 10 days not having to talk to people			1
' the couple stayed there from december 30 to january 8			0
and to ring in 2015 , the couple kept things just as low - key as they had during the rest of their holiday			0
' we actually went to bed at 10:30pm , ' he said			0
' there was a band and a few other things going on , but we were tired			0
it 's what we usually do on @entity21 's			0
' the two - and @entity16 's parents - spent @entity21 's at the resort , but the low - key couple went to bed at 10:30pm @entity16 soaked up the short - lived serenity and relaxation - in less than 2 weeks , @entity33 will join @entity132 on tour in @entity134 there 's nothing wrong with getting a good night 's sleep - and @entity16 should relish it while he can , since he and the rest of @entity33 will soon be embarking on a tour of @entity134 with @entity132			1
also on the pre-tour schedule ? keeping in top shape			0
' a resort like this is the one time i can guarantee myself exercise , ' @entity16 explained			1
' just with the routine of getting up early due to the way jetlag works going this way			0
' but that 's not to say @entity16 spent the entire time in the gym , he also enjoyed getting active outdoors with his dad , @entity26			1
' they had a fantastic floodlit tennis court that my dad and i would have a hit on in the afternoon			2
we give each other a good game , but we just had rallies , so that an argument did n't ruin our holiday			0
' ' we also got into the habit of playing chess every evening as the sun went down , ' he added			2
' there are a bunch of boats moored just off the beach that give you a bit more of a view than just of open water , but it 's still idyllic			0
' @entity16 enjoyed keeping in top shape while away , often swimming and playing a bit of tennis with his dad @entity16 and his wife absolutely ' love ' the luxurious resort , calling it ' genuinely the perfect holiday ' serenity and relaxation seemed to be the themes of @entity16 's family getaway			1
' i absolutely love the place			0
it 's so serene , quiet and understated - such a peaceful experience			0
' ' there 's not a hint of over-development			0
it 's perfectly comfortable , ' he said			0
' genuinely the perfect holiday for us			0
' ' my parents spent their honeymoon in the @entity203 about 30 years ago and have been back many times since			1
if they 're happy , you know it 's good			0
