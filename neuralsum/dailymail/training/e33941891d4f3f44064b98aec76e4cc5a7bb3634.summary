@entity1 forward @entity0 will not set himself any ambitious goals as he plots a steady return to full match sharpness			1
the @entity6 international made his first start in a year in the @entity9 third - round tie against @entity10 , and produced a few positive runs behind the defence despite lacking a finish in the penalty area			1
with his rehabilitation now almost complete - from , first the serious knee injury which shattered his @entity19 dreams last summer and then a groin problem sustained on international duty with @entity6 in november - the 25 - year - old feels achieving small targets can help make the biggest difference			2
@entity0 is setting himself short rather than long term targets as he works towards full fitness ' i like to work week by week , so i forget about the big picture and the nine months ( out )			1
week by week , hitting the goals and when you have achieved that , you can feel good about hitting something else , ' @entity0 said to @entity32			2
' you need to just come into training with a smile on your face , enjoy it and that 's all you can do			0
i remember when i had one of my injuries before , i came in down in the dumps and rehab seemed to take so much longer			0
' you do n't want that , you want to come in and feel like you 're doing something each day			0
even though it might be the same things at the start , you benefit when it comes to the end of it			0
' @entity0 outpaces @entity10 's @entity49 during the @entity9 third round last weekend with both @entity51 , who has been out with a thigh injury , and @entity53 , serving a three - match suspension , set to be available for sunday 's encounter against @entity56 , @entity0 could again find himself back on the bench , which could also include @entity60 playmaker @entity59 for the first time since october after his knee problem			1
another player uncertain of his place in the starting @entity65 is goalkeeper @entity66 , who has found himself at the centre of some unwanted headlines following reports he was caught smoking in the showers after @entity1 's 2 - 0 defeat at @entity73 on @entity74 , when he had been culpable for both goals			1
fit - again @entity77 stood in for the @entity78 international against @entity10 , but @entity81 boss @entity80 had already indicated he was likely to rotate the goalkeeper for the @entity9 tie and so now has a direct choice to make , with @entity86 @entity85 having offered back - up earlier in the season when @entity89 international @entity77 was injured			2
@entity66 was at fault for both goals that @entity1 conceded during their 2 - 0 defeat to @entity73 @entity1 are expected to look to add to the squad during the january transfer window			1
@entity96 teenage midfielder @entity95 , rated at around £ 2million by the @entity98 club , and @entity101 trialist @entity99 appear potential recruits for the future			0
however , more pressing is some defensive cover , with @entity106 captain @entity105 a player said to be on @entity80 's radar , along with @entity73 's @entity109 and @entity111 defender @entity110 , who is out of contract at @entity113 in the summer			0
there have also been reports @entity1 are preparing a shock £ 60million - plus bid for @entity120 's @entity119 midfielder @entity118			1
more likely , however , is the impending departure of forward @entity122 out on loan , although @entity80 would prefer an @entity125 side rather than a return to @entity127 at @entity128			0
@entity122 ( right ) scores against @entity130 in the @entity131 earlier this season			0

@entity0 made his first start for @entity1 in nine months against @entity10
@entity1 winger helped his side to a 2 - 0 win
@entity0 's *recovery* is near completion as he moves *closer* full match fitness
