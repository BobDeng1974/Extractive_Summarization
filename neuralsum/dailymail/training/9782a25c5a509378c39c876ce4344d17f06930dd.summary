athletic @entity1 , son of @entity13 boss @entity12 , had a seizure at his family home in @entity16 , @entity17 , after trying the @entity19 drug with friends last february			1
the teenager was found unconscious on the sofa by his mother @entity23 after she returned from a shopping trip			1
mrs @entity25 , 51 , a nurse said : ' it was lunchtime , about 12.30pm			2
he did n’t seem any different			2
i woke him and asked if he would go to the shops to get me the sunday papers but he said " no , i ’m tired , can you get me a drink ? " '			0
she returned home to find her son unresponsive and she carried out basic life - saving skills and called an ambulance			1

comforted by family members as she tried to hold back her tears in court , mrs @entity25 told the coroner : ' i ’m a nurse , so when i found him his pupils were already dilated i knew then the prognosis was n’t very good			1
' the ambulance was there very rapidly , they tried everything they could too , but he just did n’t recover			0
' mrs @entity25 said she was unaware her son had tried drugs			1
saddened : @entity1 's father @entity12 , celebrating winning the @entity57 grand final , was away in @entity59 when his son died ' i want to be able to stop somebody else doing this - every bit of that drug is harmful			1
i spoke to him on a couple of occasions about all the dangers of taking them			1
he assured me he was n’t taking any , ' she added			2
the hearing in @entity73 , @entity17 was told the young joiner was ' very athletic and very healthy ' and studying engineering three times a week			0
he was often seen with his father at @entity57 matches and was pictured with mr @entity1 senior proudly holding the @entity80 in 2001 when the coach was in charge at @entity83			1
tragedy struck after @entity1 dabbled in cocaine use with friends while his father was on a tour of @entity59 where @entity13 were playing			1

' death : the coroner said that although @entity1 had not been a regular user of cocaine , the amount he took did something to his heart another pal @entity100 said he knew @entity1 had taken a small amount of the drug two nights before he died			1
consultant pathologist dr @entity104 , who examined @entity1 ’s heart , concluded there were areas of inflammation and scarring on his heart			1
he said drugs like cocaine can cause this , as it makes the heart work harder and faster			2
it can also lead to dysrhythmia			0
dr @entity117 said : ' it is likely that this man had an unfortunate side - effect to this drug which may not have affected other people			2
we all have different bodies			0
' the heart does n’t repair itself			2
once you have these small areas of scarring , that ’s it			0
' the result is an on - going cycle of damage			0
i can not explain why this young man had this , but we do see a regular and steady trickle of cases come into the autopsy room and we are aware that a low dose does n’t mean it ’s safe			0
' recording a narrative verdict @entity140 coroner @entity140 said : ' a message that needs to get out to anybody who even considers the use of cocaine , is that any use can cause damage to the heart and it does n’t require an overdose situation or excess use			2
' @entity151 was a 19 - years - old at the time of his death			0
he was very athletic , very fit and very healthy			0
he was also a hardworking young man , who wanted to develop his education by going to college			0
' he was like many people in his generation , who wanted worked hard and played hard			0
he had lots of friends			0
the loss of a son at the age of 19 is unimaginable			2
' he told mrs @entity25 : ' your son was not a regular user of cocaine			2
i ’m extremely saddened by the death of @entity151			0
i believe he was a fine young man who was hard working , enjoyed his life and was good at sport			0
' @entity1 ’s father who has coached @entity173 , @entity83 and @entity174 , was not at the hearing but in a statement earlier this year thanked people who paid their respects			1
