@entity0 is determined not to let 14 minutes of meltdown define an entire season at @entity3			1
as far as he is concerned , the fightback starts now			2
@entity0 has listened to the flood of criticism that engulfed @entity7 in the wake of monday night ’s 3 - 1 home defeat from @entity10 , which contained that extraordinary sequence of first - half concessions			1
manager @entity13 bore the brunt of the uproar , with his position being openly questioned in some quarters , but @entity0 would prefer to look in the mirror and to those who sit beside him in the dressing - room			1
he does n’t hide from that fact that , bar maybe one game , the players simply have n’t met the standards they should have reached in the @entity27			2
@entity3 defender @entity0 insists @entity3 will not let the 3 - 1 defeat to @entity10 define their season @entity10 's @entity30 scores his second goal of the night as they defeated @entity3 3 - 1 at @entity7 yet the 27 - year - old left - back also has a sense that obituaries of their campaign are being written far too early			1
a six - point deficit has seen @entity3 replaced by @entity38 as favourites for the second - tier title by some bookmakers			1
the @entity7 club , according to that strand of opinion , are in danger of seeing their off - field woes being replicated on the pitch as their hopes drift away			1
@entity0 logs such predictions away for future use			1
expecting to see an instant response in saturday ’s trip to @entity54 , he remains steadfast in his belief that @entity3 will find real form and ultimately achieve their goals			1
‘ i definitely think it will come , ’ he said			2
‘ i have a belief that we can do it			2
‘ i ’ve got a feeling that we are being written off and the manager is being questioned			0
that goes with the territory but i believe that , with the boys we have here , we will be fine come the end of the season			1
‘ we have to use the criticism positively			1
we know it happens and you are never going to get away from that			0
we are a bit more scrutinised here but we are ready for it and it ’s up to us to go out there and make it better			0
’ the 27 - year - old @entity0 believes @entity3 will ' use the criticism ' from their loss to @entity10 ' positively ' @entity13 ( left ) is under considerable pressure after another poor @entity3 result @entity0 was n’t a chief culprit against @entity10 but was still one component of a back four that simply disintegrated once the first goal was leaked			1
rangers have defeated @entity88 opposition this term and dismantled a decent @entity91 outfit on their own patch			2
@entity0 is well aware , however , that league success is founded upon steady runs of results			1
and be believes that is primarily the responsibility of those who actually cross the white line			0
‘ we have got to do a lot more as players			0
i look at the 11 or 12 games we ’ve played so far and , @entity91 aside and the @entity106 result , there has been no consistency in our performances			0
we have to find that quickly or we are going to fall behind			0
we have to get started soon			0
‘ the buck stops with us first and foremost			0
it ’s a collective thing between the players and management			0
only a couple of times this season have we found that consistency we need and that ’s been the disappointing thing for me			2
‘ we wanted to make a mark as early as we could			0
we wanted to be sitting top of the league and to be the team everybody is talking about			0
@entity0 is fully behind manager @entity13 and says that the side will improve as the season progresses @entity30 ( second left ) celebrates with his team - mates after putting @entity10 0 - 3 up on monday night ‘ it ’s early in the season and that ’s the only positive thing			1
we have certainly got time and we , as players , have to start doing better on the pitch			2
’ @entity13 led the internal inquest this week but has also tried to rally spirits and galvanise the squad ahead of their return to action			1
having also lost at home to @entity38 , the margin of error available to @entity3 has been significantly reduced			1
‘ we ’ve looked at the stuff from the @entity10 game on the video and the manager has gone into it in detail , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ he was n’t happy and he was getting his message across			0
now it ’s up to us to respond on the park			0
‘ it was an open forum as we were watching the video			0
the players had things to say , as did the management			0
that ’s the best way - we can both reflect , look at how we can get better and move on			2
‘ at half time on monday night a couple of the lads spoke up and at the end the dressing room was not a good place to be			0
@entity3 boss @entity13 blasted his side 's dismal defending after crashing to defeat @entity162 wheels away in celebration after heading home @entity10 ' second goal at @entity7 ‘ the manager has got us focused on the next game now			1
we ca n’t get too downbeat about it			0
it was disappointing in the aftermath			0
it ’s not a great feeling when you get beat at home but you need to quickly forget about that and do n’t go into the next game mumping and moaning with heads down			0
‘ it ’s a big one for us at @entity54 and the players are looking forward to it			1
we need to start building a bit of momentum			2
’ the confidence currently coursing through @entity38 was underlined when @entity181 this week spoke about the possibility of an unbeaten league campaign			0
@entity0 is admiring of the start made by his former club , under the command of @entity188 , but cautions them against thinking too far ahead			1
‘ @entity38 are obviously going in the right direction , ’ he admitted			0
‘ we wanted to hit the ground running because there were a lot of questions asked about playing against full - time opposition this season			1
‘ we wanted to answer that quickly but i think in time we will grow into it , build a bit of momentum and we will get back to playing football in the @entity88			2
’ @entity201 celebrates scoring for @entity3 , but it was only a consolation @entity3 fans made a swift exit from @entity7 at the full - time whistle of their match against @entity10			1

@entity0 determined @entity3 ' loss to @entity10 will not define season
the 27 - year - old insists @entity3 will recover and *challenge* for *promotion*
@entity3 boss @entity13 has come under pressure *due* to average start
but @entity0 says side will ' use the criticism positively ' to improve
rangers travel to @entity54 on saturday hoping to bounce back with win
