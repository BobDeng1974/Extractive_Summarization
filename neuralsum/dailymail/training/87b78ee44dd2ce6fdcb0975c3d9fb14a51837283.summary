yep , these smart kids really can play			0
' we battled a really good basketball team in a tough environment , ' @entity166 said			2
' i 'm very proud of our guys			0

he simply asked his team for more			0
in stepped freshman point guard @entity30 , who played like a veteran			0
he was n't great against the @entity135 , finishing with five points and seven assists , but he kept his team under control , poised and found open players			0
the @entity4 shot 52 percent for the game - that 's almost 15 percent better than @entity17 's stingy defense normally allows			1

' we ca n't shoot for them , ' @entity189 said			0
' we 've had games like that , several games where we have n't shot the ball well			0
it 's a glaring weakness on this basketball team			0
' it allowed @entity4 to take a lead for good with about 6 minutes left			2
