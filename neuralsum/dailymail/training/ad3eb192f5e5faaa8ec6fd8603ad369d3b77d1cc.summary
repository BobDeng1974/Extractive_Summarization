by @entity0 published : 09:40 est , 15 february 2013 updated : 09:40 est , 15 february 2013 campaigners today slammed @entity2 for violating @entity5 users ' privacy after it emerged that the company was sharing their personal details with mobile app developers			1
an @entity10 software developer revealed that the search giant was sending him the full names , email and post codes of everyone who purchased his app on @entity2 's @entity17			1
he said the information was so detailed he would even be able to use it to ' track down and harass users who left negative reviews or refunded the app purchase '			1
a model poses with @entity26 's @entity25 smartphones , which run on @entity2 's @entity5 : an @entity5 app developer has revealed that @entity2 sends him the personal details of anyone who buys his app incredibly , it has emerged that the data sharing was not the result of a software glitch , but is actually part of @entity2 's policies for its app store and its @entity38 payment service			1
@entity39 , director of privacy and civil liberties campaign group @entity41 , today accused @entity2 of taking decisions about consumers personal data ' without their knowledge '			1
' the true facts about about what is happening are buried in vague privacy policies , ' he told @entity50			0
' apps are an increasing part of everyday life , so it ’s essential that it is made crystal clear to consumers what happens to their data			0
' app developers are n’t asking for this data , no other app stores share data in this way , so yet again we ’re faced with a situation where it looks like @entity2 has put profits before user privacy			1
' his outrage was echoed by @entity72 , executive director of the @entity74 - based @entity73 , who said @entity2 has ' buried ' the notice about how it shares users ' personal information in fine print			1
' meaningful consent is about people understanding what they 're getting into			0
it 's about not tricking them , ' said mr @entity72			0
' in a situation like this , where people just do n't know what information is being transferred or who it 's going to or for what purpose , it seems ridiculous to say that @entity2 has consent			1
' the episode is merely latest privacy flare - up for @entity2 , whose position as the world 's number one search engine has made it the biggest name in online advertising			1
the company agreed last august to pay a $ 22.5million fine to settle charges in the @entity74 that it bypassed the privacy settings of customers using @entity106 's safari browser			2
it also settled a privacy investigation by the @entity109 in 2011 related to its rollout of the now - defunct @entity113 social networking service			0
other web companies , notably @entity114 , have also drawn scrutiny over their privacy practices and entered into settlements with regulators			0
do n't be evil : the episode is merely latest privacy flare - up for @entity5 - maker @entity2 , whose position as the world 's number one search engine has made it the biggest name in online advertising @entity2 said in an emailed statement that ' @entity38 shares the information needed to process transactions , and this is clearly stated in the @entity129			1
' but mr @entity72 said he believed that @entity2 may be violating its 2011 settlement with the @entity109			2
developer @entity131 broke the issue online in a blog post on tuesday			2
' let me make this crystal clear , ' he wrote			0
' every app purchase you make on @entity138 gives the developer your name , suburb and email address with no indication that this information is actually being transferred			1
' with the information i have available to me through the checkout portal i could track down and harass users who left negative reviews or refunded the app purchase			1
' mr @entity131 added : ' this is a massive oversight by @entity2			2
under no circumstances should i be able to get the information of the people who are buying my apps unless they opt into it and it ’s made crystal clear to them that i ’m getting this information			0
' @entity158 took a pop at @entity2 last week by accusing its rival of invading @entity163 users ' privacy when scanning the contents of their emails to target them with personalised ads. the attack , the latest volley in @entity158 's @entity170 campaign , comes with a website and is aimed to boost interest in the veteran software company 's @entity174 email service			1
it follows a series of @entity170 adverts last year which targeted @entity2 's controversial privacy policies			2
' @entity2 goes through every @entity163 that ’s sent or received , looking for keywords so they can target @entity163 users with paid ads , ' the website says ' and there ’s no way to opt out of this invasion of your privacy			1
' it also includes a feed of quotes from @entity2 executive chairman @entity192			0
these include his infamous declaration that ' [ i ] f you have something that you do n't want anyone to know , maybe you should n't be doing it in the first place			0
' and also : ' we do n’t need you to type at all			0
we know where you are , with your permission ; we know where you ’ve been , with your permission ; we can more or less know what you ’re thinking about			0
' mr @entity131 's app , which automatically generates insults in the style of a well - known @entity10 politician , is already a best - seller on the @entity211 and he recently released a version for @entity2 's @entity5 operating system			1
he told @entity214 that @entity2 acts as a marketplace when an app is purchased , hence the transactions occur directly between developer and the purchaser			1
' the way the system is designed , it ( the information ) is not what a user would expect to hand over , ' he said			0
' if you buy something on the @entity228 app store , you purchase it off @entity106 , and they pass the money to the developer			0
' the @entity38 privacy notice states that @entity2 will share users ' personal information with other companies ' as necessary to process your transaction and maintain your account			1
' that 's different than the way @entity239 works			0
according to an @entity106 spokesman , the company only shares general information about the number of downloads with third - party app developers			0
@entity106 does not pass along personal information , such as email , except with publications available through its newsstand store , and only then if customers agree to it , the spokesman said			0
others have said they are pleased with @entity2 's policy of passing along customer information to developers			2
@entity258 , an app developer and editor for the online blog @entity262 , said it made it easier for developers to directly handle customer service issues , such as refunds			2
' i want to be able to service my customers , and yes , they are my customers , not @entity2 's and not @entity106 's customers			2
they download our products , ' mr @entity258 wrote			0
but @entity274 , director of the @entity275 at @entity276 , said @entity2 and other online and mobile services needed to be more transparent about what personal information was being shared with third - party firms			1
' when you buy an app , you could have a pop - up that tells you this is the information that 's going to the app developer , ' he said			2
that was an opinion echoed by mr @entity39 , who said : ' consumers could be asked for their permission if the data is required , but it ’s wholly wrong for @entity2 to take control of our data away from people like this			0
