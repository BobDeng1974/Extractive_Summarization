this is the incredible moment ice became fire when a frozen lake released a deadly gas that exploded in a massive fireball			2
toxic bubbles of highly - flammable methane are trapped in grenade - like bubbles just inches beneath the surface of the ice in lakes across @entity12			1
once popped , methane escapes the bubbles and ignites in spectacular explosions triggered by ecologist @entity16 and her team			1
as gas rushes out from the hole , one of her students holds a lighted match towards it and ignites the vapour , causing it to explode			0
@entity16 said : ' my job 's the worst , because usually you catch on fire			1
it could be 10 or 30 litres of methane per day from one little hole , and it does that all year			2
' and then you realise there are hundreds of spots like that and millions of lakes			0
the methane bubbles have been described as ' ice grenades ' that are waiting to explode @entity54 : this peaceful scene could easily be transformed into a nightmare hellish vision pull the pin : a close - up of one of the ' ice grenades ' , ready to explode ' what 's coming out of @entity64 lakes is troubling , because some of it seems to be coming not from the bottom mud , but from deeper geologic reservoirs that had been securely capped by permafrost			2
' and that contain hundreds of times more methane than is in the atmosphere now			0
' @entity16 is conducting research and by counting and measuring each bubble she hopes to work out how much methane is rising from the @entity77 in @entity78			1
if the temperature of the planet continues to rise massive quantities of the gas could be released into the atmosphere with potentially deadly effects			0
an ecologist deploys a gas trap to collect methane gas bubbling up from the bottom of the frozen lake what lies beneath : one of the ecologists stands above two trapped bubbles of methane the trapped methane is collected and removed safely double bubble : another of the trapped bubbles beneath the @entity12 lake some lakes , she says , have ' hot spots ' where the methane bubbling is so strong that ice never forms , leaving open holes big enough to spot from an airplane she said : ' if we could only capture it , it would make a great energy source			1
' methane is a deadly greenhouse gas and produces 25 times more heat than carbon dioxide , unless you burn it first			0
by venting and burning the methane it converts the potent gas into less dangerous @entity118 which could be used to produce power for mankind			0

@entity16 releases methane trapped in frozen @entity12 lakes
part of her research into *global* *warming* and *climate* change
