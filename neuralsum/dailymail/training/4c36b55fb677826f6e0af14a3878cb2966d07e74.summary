and medics warned her devastated family that even if miraculously she pulled through , she might never walk			2
yet today – following four months in hospital and 13 operations , @entity3 , from @entity15 , says the terrifying incident has changed her life for the better			1
by day , psychology graduate @entity3 worked as an arts therapist with children with special needs			1
by night she loved to indulge in the vibrant nightlife in @entity22 , @entity10 she admits ' before i had my fall , i was a perfectionist over my looks			2
i spent hours choosing exactly the right clothes , getting ready to go out and exercised five days a week in the gym			1
' @entity3 fell from the top floor of this tower block in @entity31 and incredibly , she credits the accident – which she believes was a twist of fate – for meeting the love of her life , surveyor @entity36 , 30			1
' before i had my fall , i was a perfectionist over my looks , ' says @entity3 who now manages to limp with a stick , ' i spent hours choosing exactly the right clothes , getting ready to go out and exercised five days a week in the gym			1
' now , inside my body i have four plates , a screw and a foot long metal rod			1
i have scars all over my body and will never be physically able as i used to be			1
but having my fall has put my life in perspective and incredibly i have never been happier in myself			1
' i feel so lucky to be alive			2
if i had n’t had this freak accident , @entity49 and i never would have met			1
we never stop making one another smile and every day i feel lucky to be alive			2
' @entity3 ’s life was turned upside down on @entity53 2011			1
the psychology graduate was working as an arts therapist with children with special needs at a centre in @entity22 , @entity10			2
she recalls : “ it was 2am in the morning and i ’d been partying , seeing in the @entity60 with a few drinks with friends			1
i felt dizzy and ran out of the apartment onto the balcony			1
' all i wanted was some fresh air but as i reached the balcony , i slipped in my heels and the next thing i knew i found myself hanging over the balcony , my hands gripping the rail			1
even now i do n’t know exactly how i got there			2
' for a terrifying few seconds , she felt the world had stopped			2
@entity3 slipped over the railing of her balcony at 2am on @entity53 last year she broke virtually every bone in her body and spent four months in hospital undergoing 13 operations miss @entity3 has been left with four plates , a screw and a foot long metal rod in her body ' everything seemed to happen in slow motion , ' she says , ' i remember looking up at my hands and feeling sheer fleeting panic as i realised they were gripping the balcony but my body was hanging over the edge			1
' then i saw my hands slipping , it was as if they were not my hands and i realised i was going to fall			2
' i later discovered i ’d fallen through two canopies and a satellite dish on the way down			2
the next thing i remember is waking up on the ground in the grass			2
i was lying on my back and passers by were standing over me			2
' i could n’t seem to see their faces			2
but the last thing i recall is saying to them that my legs hurt before i was engulfed with pain and passed out			2
' @entity3 came round as she was being wheeled into hospital			1
' the pain was overwhelming , just indescribable			2
a friend was at my side and i was begging him not to leave me			0
i truly felt i was going to die			0
' in fact , @entity3 ’s condition was so critical that it took surgeons ten hours in the operating theatre to stabilise her condition			1
when pretty @entity3 plummeted 100ft from a balcony , doctors didn ? t expect her to survive because she didn ¿ t have health insurance , her dad @entity120 , 60 , a business director , shelled out £ 40,000 savings to pay for treatment			1
' my beloved black satin evening dress was cut off me			0
i had so many life threatening injuries that it ’s a miracle my body did n’t just go into shock , ' she says , ' my pelvis was cracked in two places , my broken jaw was wired , my right wrist was crushed and doctors believed they might have to amputate my right leg			1
i was in the worse pain i imagined could exist			0
' the next two weeks passed as a blur as @entity3 fought for her life in intensive care			1
days and nights rolled into one as she lapsed in an out of a coma			0
because she did n’t have health insurance , her dad @entity120 , 60 , a business director , shelled out £ 40,000 savings to pay for treatment			0
meanwhile mum @entity150 , 65 , a secretary got on the first flight available to be with her daughter			0
miss @entity3 fell through two canopies and a satellite dish during her 100ft fall says @entity3 whose parents are divorced but who both spent days and nights by their daughter 's bedside , ' it was the first time i ’d seen my dad cry			1
i went from living and working my dream to fighting for my life			1
' lying in my hospital bed unable to even lift a glass or wipe my own face i wondered if i had actually died and this was hell			1
' worse was to come when doctors explained she could lose her right leg and she would probably spend the rest of her life in a wheelchair			1
' landing on a grass area had saved my life , ” she explains , “ but the bone in my right leg had shattered on impact and dirt had got into it causing a nasty infection			1
it meant whole sections of the bone had to be removed and my leg held together in a metal case to try to hold it together			1
' after four months in the @entity10 hospital she was finally discharged in a wheelchair but decided to come home to the @entity191 with her mum			1
' i needed so much help			0
i ’d lost over over a stone in weight and was so frail			0
at the same time , i needed further treatment and it seemed easiest to get it in the @entity191			0
' against all the odds @entity3 ’s leg was saved			1
but her legs were so badly damaged she could only get around in a wheelchair			0
' it was a terrible time , ' she says , ' when i had my fall i ’d been seeing someone but although he was very supportive at the time , what happened pushed us apart and we finished			0
i remember thinking that no - one would want me – someone who is so scarred and in constant pain			0
' but despite this , she did n’t give up			0
' i was determined to get better			0
i told myself i still had all my limbs and i would walk again			0
i read book after book on pain management and underwent intense physiotherapy			1
doctors said my wrist was so badly injured i would never write again but i forced myself to use a computer			0
' her determination paid off and gradually @entity3 was able to haul herself out of a wheelchair and walk using crutches			1
@entity3 met surveyor @entity36 11 months after her accident , after a mutual friend introduced them and in november 2011 – after being persuaded to go to a local pub for a drink - she met @entity49			1
' a mutual friend introduced us and i thought he was gorgeous			0
' after talking online for a few days , she was thrilled when @entity49 asked her out for a drink			0
' i felt incredibly nervous , ” she admits , “ but he never saw me as the ‘ patient ’ only as the positive person i still am			0
i did wonder if he ’d be put off by my terrible scars but he simply does n’t seem to see them			0
' we never stop making each other smile and laugh – he ’s my soulmate			0
' although she faces further surgery to her leg , she believes her near death experience has had a positive effect on her life			1
' if you ’d told me i ’d be happy with all these scars i ’d never have believed it , ' she says , ' of course what happened was terrible			0
but i ’ve found joy in the smallest achievements and a new appreciation of how fantastic it is to be alive			0
' i am thrilled i can now wash my own hair and make a cup of tea			0
i am so fortunate i still have my brain in tact and can use that to do anything i want			0
no i ca n’t have the life i once had but i can have a more fulfilling one with all that i have learned			2
' i ’ve been to hell and back but this has made me stronger because i know nothing can ever be as bad or bring me down			0
' @entity3 now intends to go back to work and hopes one day to return to @entity10			1
she says : “ before this ripped my life apart i was about to do more studying in counselling and psychology			2
what ’s happened has fuelled my ambition to continue with this to help others			0
i want to create something really positive from this nightmare			0
' she hopes telling her story will make others aware of the dangers balconies abroad pose – often they are built much lower than regulations allow in the @entity191			0
last year alone more than a dozen @entity283 fell from hotel balconies abroad			2
meanwhile she is about to go on her first holiday with @entity286 to @entity287			0
“ i never thought i ’d ever be well enough to go anywhere let alone go somewhere without a wheelchair			0
but recently after 16 gruelling months i finally had my metal case taken of my leg and now i ca n’t wait to swim in a pool			2
” she is excited about the future			0
' even the best laid plans ca n’t stop freak accidents , ' she says , ' i will never be the same again but i ’m not going to let what happened stop me from doing anything			0
' but it was n’t my fate to die and it ’s knowing that which has spurred me on to make the most of living			0
