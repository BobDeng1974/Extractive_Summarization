the heart of @entity1 was buried in the @entity2 , @entity3 , with mint , frankincense , mercury , creosote and daisies @entity1 ended up with a heart full of daisies , mint and frankincense , a @entity3 study of his mummified heart has discovered			1
the analysis also uncovered elements like creosote , mercury and perhaps lime in the heart , which has been in the western @entity3 city of @entity22 since his death in 1199			1
the study ’s leader , @entity25 , suggests the flowers and spices were to give the king the ‘ odour of sanctity ’			0
the study came out less than a month after a team of @entity35 archeologists uncovered the long - lost remains of 15th - century @entity37 - a relative but not a direct descendant of @entity1 - under a car park in @entity40			1
unlike that crude ending , @entity1 , leader of the @entity41 , was ceremoniously laid to rest in three places			0
his entrails were interred in the central @entity3 town of @entity46 , where he died in a skirmish with a rebellious baron ; his body reposes at the @entity51 , beside his father @entity52 and later his mother @entity53 ; and his heart , wrapped in linen , pickled for posterity and placed in a lead box , was sent on to the @entity2			2
in 1838 , the heart , already turned to powder , was rediscovered , transferred to a glass box and placed in @entity22 ’s @entity61			2
@entity25 , a forensic medical examiner , and his 11 - member team used the latest biomedical techniques to decipher the composition of @entity67 ’s heart			1
@entity25 , a forensic medical examiner , shows the remains of @entity1 's heart , which has undergone analysis more than 810 years after he died born on 8 september 1157 in @entity71 , son of @entity52 and @entity53 , @entity1 is one of the most popular kings in @entity75 history after leading the @entity76 against @entity77 who had captured @entity79 in the 12th century			1
he failed to take the city because of inner - feuds between his crusader allies , but scored numerous victories against @entity84 , his @entity86 counterpart			0
despite his reputation in @entity75 , @entity37 spent most of his time in his lands in @entity3 , and mainly conversed in @entity3 dialects			1
@entity37 died after a crossbow bolt pierced his shoulder during a siege of the castle of @entity95 in the @entity97 region of @entity3			1
he claims it is the oldest embalmed heart ever studied and , belonging to a king , certainly the most prestigious			2
the study was published in @entity101 , part of the @entity103			0
the aim of the study was to discover how hearts were embalmed in the 12th century , @entity25 said			0
the presence of incense in the potpourri was the most striking because , @entity25 said , it had not been found in previous embalmings , even in corpses dating from the @entity111			0
@entity25 speculates that the incense , among the gifts offered to the infant @entity114 by the three kings and reportedly used on the outside of his body at death , was meant to give @entity67 a direct line to @entity121			0

microscopic analysis showed pollen grains from daisy , myrtle and mint			2
lso found were pine , oak , poplar , plantain and bellflower , likely airborne contaminants			0
@entity150 and bellflower were blooming at the time of death , the study says			0
molecular analysis turned up frankincense , the white matter in the powder			2
there were large amounts of lead - said to be contamination from the box cradling the heart - and traces of copper and mercury , or quicksilver - commonly used at the time			1
there is also a suggestion that lime may have been used as a disinfectant			0
how bodies were preserved back then ' is a field of much speculation and , thus , such a study provides some decent evidence , ' said @entity176 , a professor at the @entity178 's @entity177			2
however , he said in an email that the study has limited impact because of its focus on a single organ and on only one , if well - known , person @entity25 with the box which contained the heart , wrapped in linen , which was full of daisies , as well as myrtle , mint and frankincense			1
