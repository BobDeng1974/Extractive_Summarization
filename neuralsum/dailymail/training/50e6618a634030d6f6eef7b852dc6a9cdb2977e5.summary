the artist from @entity14 looked casual in a cropped t - shirt with the slogan ' @entity17 ' yesterday			1
given the temperatures in @entity42 at this time of year can rise to 40 degrees , it 's not surprising that @entity19 , who is expected to marry @entity5 in october , opted for cool , summery clothing			2
but it 's a far cry from her usual look when she takes to the family box at @entity6 to watch @entity5 , 27 , play			2
@entity6 winner : @entity19 wore this £ 925 dress by @entity51 when @entity5 won the tournament in 2013 the designer dress was worn as pictures of @entity19 were beamed around the world after @entity5 's historic victory high end @entity58 : on day one of @entity6 2014 , @entity19 this white lace sleeved @entity62 ' @entity61 ' dress , £ 225 designer day : @entity19 wore this pink fitted £ 440 dress from @entity66 , @entity68 wedges and a £ 1395 @entity70 tote bag to the @entity6 quarter finals in 2014 on those occasions , she has chosen to wear a number of fitted , pretty dresses from a mix of @entity58 and designer stores			1

@entity19 's most expensive outfit worn to @entity6 was a mint , £ 925 crochet dress by @entity51 which she wore when @entity5 won the grand slam in 2013			1
smart : for the @entity6 final in 2012 she looked like she could be headed to the office in this high - waisted skirt , white blouse , wedges and @entity101 bag pretty print dresses : at the fourth round of @entity6 2013 in a £ 49.99 @entity85 dress , left , and a £ 129 swallow print dress from @entity83 at the 2014 tournament , right on the seventh day of @entity6 2014 in a pink leopard dress by @entity108 and her @entity70 tote at the final the year before , when the outcome had been quite different for @entity5 as he lost to @entity113 , she had dressed smartly in a fitted high - waisted skirt and white blouse with leopard print wedges			1
