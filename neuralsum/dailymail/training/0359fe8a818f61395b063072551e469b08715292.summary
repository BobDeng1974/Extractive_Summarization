the cigar - chomping solicitor , renowned for helping ex-wives land huge divorce settlements , was captured on @entity8 crashing into the @entity9 – shunting it yards down the street – while trying to reverse in one of @entity13 ’s most exclusive roads			1
he owned up only after the footage , from a resident ’s security camera , was handed to police who confronted him with the evidence			0
but magistrates decided he should only have to pay £ 600 , a £ 30 ‘ victim surcharge ’ and £ 85 costs , and be given five penalty points			1
now the owner of the @entity9 – which was written off – has claimed the sentence was too lenient and will not act as a deterrent			0
mr @entity0 – whose motto is ‘ do n’t get even , get @entity0 ’ – once helped @entity43 reportedly scoop a £ 4million lump sum , a £ 2million house and a £ 15,000 - a - month allowance from @entity47			1

video of the incident in @entity60 , @entity61 , shows mr @entity0 ’s @entity1 reversing slowly into a parking space in march			2
then , with the manoeuvre seemingly completed , it suddenly ploughs into the @entity9 parked behind before speeding away			2
the vehicle ’s owner , 23 - year - old @entity24 , told the @entity66 : ‘ it seems so unfair that the punishment for a hit and run accident like this , even though nobody was injured , is just £ 600 and five penalty points			1
the sentence seems unduly lenient – certainly it is no deterrent for these type of offences			0
’ mr @entity24 , who works in sports marketing , lives with his society gp father and mother in @entity78			0
plenty of room : @entity8 shows mr @entity0 begin to reverse his mercedes along @entity82 , in @entity61 getting closer : he continues towards @entity24 's @entity9 , which is parked on the street oops ! : the @entity1 went on to plough into the @entity9 , which mr @entity24 says was written off in the incident the road was in the headlines in 2004 when one of its residents , @entity88 banker @entity87 , was stabbed to death during a robbery at his home			1
around that time a number of households clubbed together to buy @entity8 cameras to improve security			0
mr @entity24 said he was abroad when his car was damaged but his mother and a neighbour trawled through hours of @entity8 footage which was then handed to police			1
he added : ‘ the insurance company paid out for the value of the car			0
it was worth a little over £ 2,000 when it was written off			0
’ mr @entity0 lives in an £ 8million house in @entity61 while his law firm , @entity109 , is based in @entity110			1
he pleaded guilty when his case was heard before @entity112 on august 27			0

failing to stop after an accident can result in up to ten points , a £ 5,000 fine and six months in jail			0
last night mr @entity0 said : ‘ whilst i can not give you a detailed response , i can say that i told the police the particular mitigating circumstances , of which the court were informed , and presumably they were taken into account			2
‘ all that happened was whilst parking in the middle of the day i reversed into a parked car , having suffered a severe abdominal pain seconds before			2
