by @entity0 first came glamping , the middle class approach to spending a night under canvas without all the wind and rain			0
but if that all seems a bit passé - and you ’re not easily spooked – then you might want to try the next big holiday trend of church camping or ‘ champing			2
’ sleeping overnight inside a disused church is the latest initiative by @entity12 ( @entity12 ) , the charity which looks after more than 300 redundant churches nationwide			2
rugs are laid out on flagstones in the nave and visitors sleep on inflatable mattresses with blankets			1
folding chairs , tables , a tea - making kit and portable lavatory and water basin add to the comfort it hopes that trippers , keen for a quirky and educational holiday experience , will flock to stay in one of their historical @entity31 listed buildings , and help generate cash for their upkeep in the process			1
the charity are currently trialling group camping trips at @entity37 , in @entity38 , @entity39			1
some might think that the medieval @entity41 - listed church , with its gothic windows , handsome limestone pillars and arches and creepy gargoyles , would not be conducive to a good night ’s sleep			1
but , although some visitors have admitted to feeling anxious , most have reported a very peaceful and satisfying stay , said @entity49 , a spokesman for the @entity12			2
‘ some people have been a bit nervous because they thought it may be a bit creepy , but afterwards they ’ve said they found it very calm and relaxing , ’ she said			0
‘ the feedback we ’ve had is they ’ve enjoyed getting back to nature and the peace and quiet			0

folding chairs , tables , a tea - making kit and portable lavatory and water basin , installed in the vestry , add to the comfort			1
guests are treated to a home - cooked meal at a local farmhouse bed and breakfast , before returning to the church where candles are lit at nightfall and a local historian arrives to regale them with magical stories about local myths and legends			2
guests are treated to a home - cooked meal at a local farmhouse b&b , before returning to the church where candles are lit and a local historian regales them with magical stories about local myths and legends @entity91 and egg baps are brought in by the same b&b for breakfast			0
the scheme is being run in conjunction with the @entity97 , who offer sessions on bat spotting in the surrounding graveyard , and @entity102 , a local adventure firm which organises self - guided paddle trips along the nearby @entity105 as part of the deal			0
packages start from £ 99 per person , including the activities			1
the @entity12 say they are already in talks to set up a similar scheme at a church in @entity114 , and hope to bring on board other activities , such as hiking , cycling and star gazing , as well as rolling champing out to other venues across the country			0
you can sleep in @entity37 @entity123 , @entity38 village , @entity39 ‘ it is certainly one of the more innovative things we are doing and we are looking to make a profit , ’ miss @entity49 said			1
‘ but any money we make all goes back into conserving the churches we look after			0
’ village resident @entity131 , who sits on the parish council , said local people in @entity38 had been supportive of the ‘ champing ’ trips			2
‘ there ’s not been any objections , ’ he added			0
‘ the church was decommissioned 70 years ago and has been redundant a long while			1
it ’s been used for the odd musical event , but there ’s no pews or facilities , such as electricity or drainage , so it ’s a big , quite spectacular cavernous floor space inside			0
‘ we ’re right in the middle of the @entity105 and the @entity105 is less than half a mile away , so it ’s perfect for the canoeing			0

first nights will be at at @entity152 , in @entity38 , @entity39
