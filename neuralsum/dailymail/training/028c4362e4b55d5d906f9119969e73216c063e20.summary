by @entity1 reporter published : 06:02 est , 16 july 2012 updated : 06:25 est , 16 july 2012 unexpected arrival : @entity3 with her partner @entity4 and their surprise son @entity5 a woman who was told her aches and pains were due to injuries from a car crash was astonished when she gave birth to a baby			1
@entity14 , 25 , said she had no idea she was pregnant until she was rushed to hospital with suspected internal bleeding five months after a motorway prang – only to be told she was actually in labour			1
the former @entity21 assessor visited doctors six times after the accident , complaining of a bad back and swollen stomach			1
however , each time the medics put her symptoms down to the bump she had on a slip - road			1
now weeks after giving birth @entity3 still ca n’t believe she ’s a mother			1
she said : ' every time i went to see my gp they put my symptoms down the crash			1
even when my periods stopped they said it had been caused by the stress and trauma of the crash			1
' i was terrified i would die of internal bleeding when i was rushed to hospital so at first i was relieved when they said i was actually pregnant			1
then they said i was in labour and it hit me that i was about to give birth to a baby			1
' i went into shock again			2
my partner just went white			2
we could n’t believe it was happening , especially given the amount of time i ’d spent in the @entity59 surgery			2
' her partner , @entity60 , 25 , said : ' earlier that night @entity3 had posted a status on @entity63 complaining of a stomach ache			2
i had to go and tell everybody why			2
at first they did n’t believe me at first			2
' hours later their son was born and they called the 7lb 3oz baby boy @entity5			1
@entity3 said : ' it 's a miracle he survived the accident and then went unnoticed by all those doctors so many times			1
i was worried about all the drugs i had taken			2
but he ’s perfect and i love being a mum			2
' i always wanted a baby one day but i never thought it would happen like this			1
' @entity3 , from @entity82 , was on her way to work in january this year when she tried to get on the motorway but with no gaps in the traffic came to a halt on the slip road			2
her vehicle was struck from behind by another car at 70 miles per hour and her car was a write off			2
she said : ' the police and an ambulance came but it was n’t until the next day when i woke in agony that i realised i ’d even been hurt			2
' daddy 's boy : @entity4 with his son shortly after the birth @entity3 was diagnosed with bruising and whiplash			1
but despite being prescribed painkillers , as the weeks passed , her injuries seemed to get worse rather than better			2
she said : ' i went back to work two weeks later			0
the bruising had started to fade but my back was aching and i could n’t stand for long			0
' the damaged car after the accident @entity3 went back to her gp and was prescribed painkillers for discomfort associated with whiplash			0
but over the next few weeks she visited several more times complaining of more backache and irregular periods			1
' they said that was also due to the crash because stress and trauma can stop your cycle			1
it made sense so i did n’t question it , ' she said			0
@entity3 was also putting on weight but put that down to being unable to exercise due to her injuries			0
' my weight has always fluctuated and again it made sense because i had n’t been very active since the crash			1
' by may this year she ’d been back to her gp six times			0
' the last time i was so worried about my back ache that i asked for a scan but was told it was n’t necessary and to keep up with the painkillers			0
' i ’d been living on @entity139 since the crash and it was starting to get me down			1
i just wanted to feel better again			0
' @entity142 to meet you : @entity3 went to the doctors six times but her pregnancy was n't noticed then on 23rd may this year @entity3 , who had started a new job as nursery nurse , got a stomach ache at work			0
soon after what she thought was her period started			0
' i was pleased it was a sign of things getting back to normal , ' she said			0
but back at home the cramps got worse and at 3am her worried student boyfriend called an ambulance			0
' i told them about the crash and the pain i had been in ever since			1
their immediate concern was internal bleeding			0
i thought i might die the pain was that bad			0
' she was rushed to hospital where an @entity168 doctor examined her stomach and ordered scan that revealed she was in fact pregnant			0
' it was like it was happening to someone else			0
things like that do n’t happen in real life			0
' but before the astonished couple had time for the news to sink in , doctors dropped the bombshell that not only was @entity3 pregnant – but she was full term and needed to push			0
' i looked at @entity60 and could see he was struggling to take it in too			0
i told him to call my mum and they wheeled me straight to the maternity ward to give birth			0
’ their son was born two hours later at 6.23 am that morning			0
@entity4 , pictured with @entity3 before her pregnancy , said friends and family did n't believe them at first after they announced the birth of their son @entity3 with her son @entity5			0
doctors told her that an earlier car crash was responsible for her pregnancy pains she said : ' when i held him i kept thinking it was a dream			1
how could this baby be mine ? ' thank @entity202 after all he 'd been through he was perfect and we ca n’t believe how lucky we are to have him			1
' and as soon as i gave birth all the crash ‘ symptoms ’ stopped straight away			1
' i think if they had examined me more thouroughly they would have found out i was pregnant and i would have worked it out had they not kept telling me everything was due to the crash			1
' she added : ' i was on the pill			0
the last thing in the world i expected was a baby			1
' but i ’m just lucky that were both well and so proud to be a mummy			0

medics said @entity14 's periods had stopped because of the trauma from crash
' i kept thinking it was a dream . how could this baby be mine ? '
