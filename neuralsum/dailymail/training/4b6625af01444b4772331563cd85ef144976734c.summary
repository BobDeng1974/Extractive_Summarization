@entity0 's on tuesday released another video focused on improving public perceptions of their fast food products -- this time with a focus on the @entity6			1
the video is a step - by - step look at the making of the deep - fried morsels that seems specifically designed to fix misconceptions that @entity0 's uses so - called ' pink slime ' meat in its nuggets			1
along with a similar video about the @entity19 , the campaign is pushing to change its reputation as unhealthy snack food in a country where people increasingly want options that feel more wholesome			0
on tuesday , the @entity35 , @entity36 - based company announced a 4.6 percent decline in sales at locations open at least 13 months			1
nearly as soon as the @entity6 video begins inside a @entity44 chicken factory , the video 's host whips out an @entity45 that shows the picture of pink goo oozing out of a tube that nauseated readers across the internet starting in 2012			1
' i do n't know where that picture came from , but that 's not used in @entity6 , ' says the @entity44 staffer charged with giving the tour			2
instead of the chemically separated garbage , the cameras show teams of @entity44 employees studiously hacking away at whole chickens on the factory line			2
what they 're left with in the next step are the breast , rib meat , dark meat and skin			0
only the white meat goes into @entity6 , says the tourguide			0
chicken factory : the video comes after a how - it 's - made @entity74 , which came out last month			1
it takes place inside a chicken factory ' no beaks ? no feet ? ' : the @entity44 tour guide shows all white meat that goes into @entity6 , plus a little skin ' for flavor ' not pink slime : ' we grind it to give you that really meaty texture that you expect in @entity6 , ' says the tour guide ' this is the only part of the chicken that goes into the @entity6 , ' asks the @entity0 's video host			1
' nothing else ? no beaks , no feet ? the tour guide gives an emphatic ' no ' and it 's on to the grinder			0
there , both the host and tour guide are sure to point out that the ground product does not look slimey at all			0
' we grind it to give you that really meaty texture that you expect in @entity6 , ' says the tour guide			0
before the nuggets are formed into their iconic shapes , they get mixed with ingredients like flavor enhancers , moisture enhancers and preservatives			0
a triple - step breading and battering process , that last of which imbues the nuggets with their decided golden hue and peppery / celery notes , comes next			2
then flash fry , freeze and voila ! @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 ( @entity124 , @entity122 , @entity125 , @entity126 [ @entity127 ] , @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 ) , @entity131 , @entity126 ( @entity127 )			0
battered and breaded with : water , @entity133 ( @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 ) , @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity142 ( @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 ) , spices , @entity125 , @entity129 , @entity149 , starch @entity0 's @entity6 meat pictured in a mixer as the other ingredients like flavor enhancers and preservatives are added then company responded to outrage that emerged from a photo that showed the @entity160 meat prior to being cooked in a similar way			1
both come out , no doubt , of the company 's need to improve public perceptions of its product and with them its bottom line			2
the world 's largest hamburger chain said monday the drop in global sales at locations open at least 13 months included a 4.6 percent decline in the @entity175 and a 4 percent decline for the unit that includes the @entity178 , the @entity179 and @entity180			1
in its flagship @entity175 market , @entity181 is facing with a number of challenges , including increased competition and changing eating habits , with places such as @entity188 gaining in popularity			2
industry analysts say the attraction of places like @entity188 is in part that people can better customize their orders			0
as @entity0 's continues to struggle in the @entity175 , ceo @entity196 has conceded the company has n't done enough to keep up with shifting habits			1
in october , he said changes are in store for its @entity175 restaurants , including the simplification of its menu			0
three breading steps : the shaped nuggets then pass through a thin curtain of batter and then get breaded the final batter step gives the nuggets their signature golden hue , it appears @entity213 , voila : the nuggets are given a quick flash fry just to harden the batter , then frozen and shipped to a @entity0 's near you			1
