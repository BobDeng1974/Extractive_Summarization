@entity1 vice-president @entity0 says if the current doping allegations in athletics are true then it will be a scandal on a par with those which erupted around @entity9 and @entity11 ' positive drugs tests			1
an investigation is to begin into allegations of a cover - up of systematic doping in @entity16 , with a number of leading @entity1 officials stepping down while that takes place			1
there are also claims that a list exists which names 150 athletes with suspicious blood results from 2006 to 2008 , with three @entity25 - one high - profile - said to be on it			1
it is alleged the @entity1 did not follow up those on the list			1
@entity1 vice-president @entity0 is deeply concerned with the current doping allegations in athletics all the allegations have come from a series of programmes made by @entity35 television station @entity34 and if proven , they would have serious ramifications for the sport			1
' how do @entity39 benchmark this ? in the 40 or so years in athletics , there have been big moments			0
@entity9 in 1988 , @entity11 , this is up there and nobody is remotely suggesting these allegations are not serious , ' @entity0 said on @entity50 's @entity49 programme			1
@entity9 failed a doping test after winning @entity53 100 metres gold in @entity54 in 1988 , while @entity55 was stripped of five @entity53 titles for doping breaches			1
when asked if this case could be of that magnitude , @entity0 added : ' if this is provable , of course it is			0
' @entity0 wants @entity34 , and its journalist @entity63 , to give him any more information there is , including the list of names which he has suggested may be far from official			2
@entity9 ( second left ) failed a doping test after winning @entity53 100 metres gold in @entity54 in 1988 ' it 's been described as a bad week for athletics - i would go further , it 's been a ghastly week			1
none of us should hide or shy away from that			0
we have to bring this tawdry , sorry episode and any of those allegations to a close as quickly as we can , ' he said			0
' i do n't know about the existence of this list , it only got mentioned on @entity35 television			0
the simple answer is i do n't know , the @entity1 does not know what this list contains and whether it is a list that has any veracity at all			1
' the offer we make as a federation is , if there is more information out there , if this @entity35 journalist feels there is a list , or whatever he 's got , please let us know what it is			0
we need to bring this to a close as quickly as possible			0
that can be done by the @entity1 's ethics committee , it can be done by @entity107			2
we would go to @entity108 and look at what he 's got but we have to get as much information as we can on this			0
' nobody at the @entity1 has seen a list			2
what we understand is that this @entity35 journalist may have shown some people in the press a list of names , but nobody knows what this list is and the suspicion is that this list is not what this @entity35 journalist is purporting it to be			0
@entity11 was stripped stripped of the medals she won at the @entity124 for doping breaches ' the offer is a simple one			1
if he has got a list , or more information he thinks is salient , please put them into the @entity1 ethics committee , or @entity107 ( the @entity107 )			2

. i can understand why			0
if he has a problem with that , we will take a @entity107 official with us			0
