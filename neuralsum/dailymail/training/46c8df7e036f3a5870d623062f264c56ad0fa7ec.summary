off the hook : since the law changed last year , 43 applications for removal from the @entity3 have been approved police have secretly removed dozens of convicted sex offenders , including paedophiles and rapists , from the @entity9 ’ @entity10 , the @entity11 can reveal			1
following a human rights ruling , the law was changed last year to allow sex attackers to claim they no longer posed a threat and apply to be taken off the register			1
since then , 43 applications have been approved behind closed doors , at the rate of one every five days			1
about half of those who apply have been successful – including eight rapists and 27 child sex attackers			1
each case was signed off by a mid-ranking police officer following a paper review of the case			0
with the stroke of a pen , each convict was removed from the list , and is now free to walk the streets with no monitoring of any kind			2
those who are taken off the register no longer have to tell the police where they are living , even if they move near a school , or move in with a family with young children			1
nor do they have to tell the police about any overseas travel			0
forces are refusing to name those taken off the register , citing @entity47 8 of the @entity48 – the right to a private and family life – and data protection rules			2
and they say it would ‘ compromise the health and safety of these individuals ’ to name them			0
some are even refusing to give details of the offences committed , and victims are not routinely notified if their attacker has been deemed no longer a threat			1
child protection charities said the use of the law was setting back child protection , and questioned whether sex offenders could ever be reformed			1
@entity69 , director of children ’s charity @entity71 , said : ‘ this step removes a number of bricks from the wall of child protection , and takes us back to the level of a number of years ago			2
‘ the jury is out on whether someone who has committed these crimes can ever be cured			0
the worry is someone could be let off the register and commit further crimes and harm more children			2
’ @entity88 , director of the @entity90 think - tank , said : ‘ the @entity91 exists to protect the public from people who risk committing serious crimes			0
' these decisions involve a very one - sided and backward understanding of human rights			0
it wrongly puts the welfare of serious sex offenders above concern for public safety			2
’ the @entity11 used the @entity103 to ask all 43 police forces in @entity106 and @entity107 how many sex offenders they had removed from the list between september 1 , when the law came into force , and the end of march			1
of the 27 who replied , there have been 91 applications and 43 sex offenders taken off the register			1
one force , @entity118 , has approved all eight of its applications , including two rapists , one of whom attacked a child			1
only one force , @entity126 , said it was contacting victims to tell them what was happening			0
ministers were forced to allow the law change after a human rights ruling in 2010 which said it was a breach of criminals ’ rights under @entity47 to keep them on the register without any chance of appeal			0
the case was brought by two convicted sex offenders			0
@entity139 , @entity140 , was jailed for five years for violently attacking and indecently assaulting a girl			0
he said the ‘ stress ’ of being kept indefinitely on the register had contributed to his ill health			0
the other was a man from @entity146 who was 11 when he raped a boy of six			0
he said his name should be taken off because it prevented him from going on holiday			0
there are about 37,000 sex offenders on the register			1
a @entity154 spokesman said : ‘ @entity3 offenders who remain a risk to the public will stay on the register , for life if necessary			1
‘ we argued strongly that sex offenders should stay on the register for life			2
but the @entity162 decided they should be able to apply for a review of their case			0
‘ it is for individual police forces to decide how to manage known sex offenders living in the community , but those who pose a risk to the public will remain on the register			1

sex attackers can be removed from register if they ' no longer pose a threat '
43 applications for removal from @entity3 approved in a year
successful applicants include eight rapists and 27 child sex attackers
