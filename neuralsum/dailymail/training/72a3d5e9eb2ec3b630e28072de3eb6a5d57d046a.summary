by @entity0 controversial : the health watchdog @entity2 has called for more obese people with the condition to be considered for a gastric band or bypass free weight - loss surgery could be offered to nearly a million diabetes patients			1
the health watchdog yesterday called for more obese people with the condition to be considered for a gastric band or bypass			1
at a stroke , @entity2 ’s ruling doubles to 1.8million the numbers qualifying for taxpayer - funded surgery			1
but campaigners said it was wrong to offer operations costing £ 5,000 when the @entity20 faces a £ 30billion deficit and @entity2 is denying cancer patients life - extending drugs			1
they warned the obese should instead be told to eat less and exercise more			0
‘ we ’ve got a mismatch between what @entity2 recommends and what the country can afford , ’ said @entity23 of the @entity24			1
‘ thousands of people will look at this and say – i fit that criteria , i want the surgery			2
this is going to stretch clinical commissioning groups to the limit – we ’ve got a creaking @entity36 as it is			0
we could end up with a situation where clinical commissioning groups say we ca n’t get the extra midwives we need for the local hospital , we ca n’t pay for life - saving drugs for people with cancer – because other people have been given the right to have expensive bariatric surgery			1
’ the surgery covers procedures including gastric bands and gastric bypasses , where the digestive system is rerouted past most of the stomach			1
@entity2 said a gastric bypass on the @entity20 costs £ 5,410 and a gastric band £ 2,473			1
weight - loss surgery is given to patients who are morbidly obese with a body mass index score of more than 40			2
it is also offered to those who have a @entity61 over 35 with another serious health condition , such as type 2 diabetes			0
around a million people qualify under these rules – although in practice only around 10,000 operations are carried out every year			2
but now @entity2 is suggesting that diabetics with a @entity61 score of 30 or more should be considered for an assessment for weight - loss operations on the @entity20			1
diabetes @entity72 says the new rules mean between 850,000 and 900,000 extra people could qualify			2
rise : the ruling would double the number of people who could qualify for taxpayer - funded surgery to 1.8million it will be up to individual clinical commissioning groups , which hold local @entity20 budgets , to decide whether the surgery should be funded in their areas			1
@entity72 is in the grip of an obesity epidemic and 2.9million people now have diabetes , a condition which in its type 2 form is linked to poor lifestyle			0
@entity92 , director of clinical practice at @entity2 , said : ‘ obesity rates have nearly doubled over the past ten years and continue to rise , making obesity and overweight a major issue for the @entity36			2
‘ updated evidence suggests people who are obese and have been recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes may benefit from weight loss surgery			2
more than half of people who undergo surgery have more control over their diabetes following surgery and are less likely to have diabetes - related illness ; in some cases surgery can even reverse the diagnosis			1
’ @entity2 says that by losing weight patients can reduce the damaging consequences of diabetes , such as the risk of blindness or heart attack			2
its guidance states that an operation is repaid in savings to the @entity20 within three years			0
after that , there are gains of around £ 4,000 per year per patient			0
but @entity122 of @entity123 said : ‘ @entity2 does n’t seem to know the @entity20 is heading for a deficit			1
they are wasting our money			0
obese people should be encouraged to eat less and take more exercise – rather than having this expensive treatment paid for			0
’ @entity130 , from the charity @entity131 , said : ‘ bariatric surgery should only be considered as a last resort if serious attempts to lose weight have been unsuccessful and if the person is obese			0
‘ it can lead to dramatic weight loss , which in turn may result in a reduction in people taking their type 2 diabetes medication and even in some people needing no medication at all			0
this does not mean , however , that type 2 diabetes has been cured			0
‘ these people will still need to eat a healthy balanced diet and be physically active			0
’ the @entity61 score is a simple measure based on height and weight with a score higher than 25 indicating overweight and 30 or more being judged as obese .			0

the ruling means 1.8million will qualify for taxpayer - funded surgery
campaigners say it *'s* wrong to offer £ 5,000 surgeries during a £ 30bn deficit
@entity2 said a bypass on the @entity20 costs £ 5,410 and a gastric band £ 2,473
