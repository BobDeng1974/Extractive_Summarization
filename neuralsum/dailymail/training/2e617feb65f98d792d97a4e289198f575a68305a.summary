by @entity0 published : 18:21 est , 23 october 2012 updated : 06:36 est , 24 october 2012 ' @entity2 ' @entity1 , who lost his legs in an explosion in @entity5 , has become the face of @entity8 's @entity7 sprawled on the dusty @entity5 battlefield , he was minutes from bleeding to death after he was blown up by an ied			1
hero soldier @entity1 had suffered the appalling injuries while undertaking one of the most dangerous tasks in the @entity15 - searching for buried bombs at the front of a patrol			1
but he missed one planted device which was cunningly made with a low metal content to reduce the chance of detection - costing him both legs			1
his life was saved only by the quick action of his comrades who helped stem the catastrophic blood loss before evacuating him from the battlefield			2
now @entity31 , 27 , is facing two huge challenges : learning to walk again and helping raise millions of pounds for the @entity8 's @entity7			1
two years after he was nearly killed , @entity31 , who served with 33 engineer @entity33 , is the face of the charity 's £ 42million fundraising drive for 2012			1
he hopes his story will inspire members of the public to dig deep and beat the record £ 40million the @entity8 raised last year			1
@entity31 , of @entity42 , @entity43 , was fulfilling his dream when he joined the @entity15 shortly after leaving school			0
part of the @entity47 , he was the lead man of a search patrol looking for @entity50 designed to murder and maim troops and civilians			0
operating in the @entity55 - e @entity54 district of @entity56 , he walked in front of the patrol , sweeping the ground with his @entity61 detecting machine in a bid to locate roadside bombs			0
it is such a treacherous role because if a lead man misses a device , he is likely to be the one to trigger it			0
on october 13 , 2010 , during his second tour of duty , the unthinkable happened			0
using a soldier 's notoriously black humour , @entity31 said : ' i found one using an unconventional method - i stood on it			1
' after the initial contact i was thrown through the air and there was a lot of dust and noise , and it took a while to settle			0
' after about 30 seconds i was shouting to the rest of the lads , " who 's hurt ? " and they turned round and said , " you are "			1
i did n't realise straight away			0
' unbowed : @entity1 undergoing gruelling physiotherapy at @entity90 in @entity91			1
fitness is key to rehabilitation remembrance : he is currently using shorter prosthetic legs to train for a full - sized pair woth £ 30,000 @entity31 had lost both legs above the knee			1
disregarding their own safety , his colleagues dashed to give him medical treatment - applying tourniquets to his damaged legs to stop the bleeding			1
' they saved my life , ' he said			0
' if they had n't done what they did , i would n't be here			0
' the soldier was evacuated from the battlefield , treated at the state - of - the - art @entity115 field hospital at @entity117 , and flown back to the military wing of the @entity119 in @entity120			2
five weeks later , @entity31 was beginning the gruelling recovery process that will see him walk again			0
he has spent the last two years in and out of @entity90 , the rehabilitation centre in @entity91 , where he is treated by leading prosthetic experts and physios to make sure he regains the strength to walk unaided			2
currently , he is using ' stubbies ' - short prosthetic limbs that teach soldiers to walk on false legs			2
but he is progressing on to his £ 30,000 c - legs , which are made by the @entity132 company @entity131 for above - the - knee amputees			2
' it 's all about strength and fitness , ' he said			2
' the stronger you are , the fitter you are			0
' before the explosion : @entity31 was on his second tour of duty when he was horrifically injured in the blast @entity31 became involved with the @entity8 after attending its £ 30million @entity142 , which provides sports and adventure activities to help wounded and sick service personnel recover			1
based at @entity148 in @entity43 , it offers injured troops a range of activities including rock - climbing , swimming , kayak canoeing and wheelchair basketball to boost their confidence and fitness			0
' it was daunting at first , ' said @entity31 , ' but people in the military love a challenge and to be pushed out of their comfort zone and that 's exactly what it did			2
' it shows you that just because you 're injured , there are still things you can go and do which is a massive bonus			0
it has given me a positive outlook which has really helped in all parts of my life			0
' the soldier said it was a ' great honour ' to front the @entity7 campaign			1
' if it was n't for the @entity115 public being so generous and funding places like the @entity183 , injured soldiers and their families would find it more difficult to get their lives back on track			0
' forward : the @entity8 's @entity7 hopes to beat the £ 40million it raised last year the @entity8 has secured the support of pop stars @entity193 and @entity194 to launch the 92nd @entity7			1
they will unveil a major campaign for the @entity196 , their families and veterans : ' standing shoulder to shoulder with @entity196 families			0
' the @entity8 offers flexible and wide - ranging support to all generations of the @entity196 and their families , including emergency grants , debt advice , employment and training support , assistance through tribunals and inquests , as well as care homes and family breaks .			1
