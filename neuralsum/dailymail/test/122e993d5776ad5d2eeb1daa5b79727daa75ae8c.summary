a seven - year - old @entity1 boy has died after getting separated from his parents on a family skiing holiday in the @entity16 resort of @entity17 near @entity27 ( pictured above )			1
he fell down a 160ft cliff after trying to find his parents police are still trying to piece together the tragic sequence of events , but they believe the little boy was killed instantly in the fall on friday after leaving the marked ski slope to look for his family			1
investigators are unsure how he came to be at the top of the steep 320ft - high cliff , which overshadows the @entity17			1
one theory is that he wandered away from a blue run to try to find his family , while there has also been speculation that he may have fallen off one of the ski resort 's lifts			1
his frantic family began searching for him at around 4pm			2
they scoured the piste and , increasingly worried , alerted the piste patrol who launched a search			2
at around 6pm search and rescue workers discovered his tracks in the snow leading through woodland up to the top of the cliff , where they found his abandoned skis			1
he was then spotted by rescuers in a helicopter , and they recovered his body at around 7.30pm from the bottom of the cliff			2
the area was described as a ' dangerous , out - of - bounds area ' by emergency services , who said rescuers had to be winched down from a helicopter to retrieve the body			2
the conditions in the @entity16 ski resort of @entity17 ( pictured ) were clear and sunny but it is believed the boy ventured off - piste while trying to find his parents			1
police found tracks in the snow which led to his body @entity83 , an officer with the @entity85 mountain rescue service , told reporters that the boy had been skiing with his mother , brother and sister , but he had asked to ski alone for his last descent of the day			1
