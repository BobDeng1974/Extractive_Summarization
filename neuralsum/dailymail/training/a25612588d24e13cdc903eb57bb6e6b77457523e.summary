sharks who spend too much time in the sun get a tan , researchers have discovered			1
however , they do not appear to suffer from skin disease , raising hopes that shark skin could hold the key to beating skin cancer			1
' as far as i 'm aware , sharks appear very robust to skin damage and disease , ' said @entity15 , a researcher in the @entity16 at @entity18 's @entity17			1
they may look like ferocious predators , but skincare is important to sharks , researchers have found			2
@entity24 scientists found the animals have protection in their skin that stops them suffering skin disease , even though they can get a tan			1
' i do n't know what makes shark skin so special , but it definitely needs to be studied			1
' there have been a lot of attempts to induce melanomas in sharks to no affect			0
' researchers hope that if they can find the secret of how shark skin protects itself , it could be used to create a ' shark lotion ' to protect human skin			1
another recent study , undertaken by the @entity45 , also looked at tanning in sharks			0
hammerhead shark pups held in a shallow clear seawater pond at the @entity50 darkened after several weeks , where uv levels are 600 times greater than those in their regular habitat of @entity56			2
an opaque filter was placed over the pectoral fins of untanned sharks to cut out uv light , to determine whether the darkening was due to solar radiation			0
' areas of skin from under the opaque filter were untanned , whereas all other skin exposed to direct sunlight was considerably darker , resulting in distinct ' tan lines ' , the researchers said			2
this @entity70 could hold the key to improved skin protection for humans , researchers hope			0
' our experiments demonstrated that the sharks were truly sun - tanning and that the response was , in fact , induced by the increase in solar radiation , particularly uv			0
' these sharks increased the melanin content in their skin by 14 percent over 21 days , and up to 28 percent over 215 days			0
' the researchers said the only other animals known to suntan are mammals .			0

@entity24 team found shark skin simply *changed* from *brown* to black in the sun
@entity96 ' very robust ' to skin damage and disease
@entity100 could lead to ' shark lotion ' to protect human skin
