@entity0 is hoping to bring in new signings before @entity2 open their @entity4 campaign at @entity5 next weekend with the club closing in on a £ 2.75 million deal for @entity8 right back @entity9			1
@entity0 denied a deal had been completed for @entity9 but asked about potential signings next week said : ‘ in football it ’s possible and we will wait to see			1
’ @entity9 , 21 , came on as a substitute in three appearances in the @entity17 for the @entity18 , and looks likely to make the move to @entity20 but @entity0 will have to wait a little longer to see if @entity2 can also bring holding midfielder @entity21 , with @entity22 insisting that the @entity23 wo n’t be sold			1
@entity2 looked to be convincing winners until a shaky last 15 minutes – but at least saw left back @entity42 get his first run out at @entity44 and a good debut from @entity46 , as well encouraging displays from @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity29			2
@entity46 , born in @entity51 , raised in @entity52 and signed from sporting last week , looked comfortable at centre half while @entity48 , who missed the pre-season @entity18 tour due to malaria , looked back to near full fitness			1
‘ it was a good performance and not just @entity46 but the whole team , said @entity0			0
‘ @entity60 is getting stronger every day after it was impossible for him to come on the @entity18 tour , but he ’s getting better now			0
’ opening goal : @entity48 puts @entity2 ahead with a left - foot strike in the first half against @entity33 on the scoresheet : @entity66 striker @entity50 doubled @entity2 ' leader in the second half with @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 and possibly @entity72 to come back into this team and with @entity74 recovering from injury , @entity0 has n’t quite shown his full hand as yet			1
and though @entity2 moved the ball well enough , @entity0 was a constant presence on the touchline , cajoling his team and urging them to calm down in possession			2
‘ it ’s hard work to translate your philosophy and put it into practice in 25 days but i ’m very pleased with the players , ’ he said			0
@entity50 and @entity48 both established credentials for starting at @entity5 next week by getting on the score - sheet – but @entity29 ’s first - half display was the most intriguing			0
@entity0 does seem to be coaxing better performances from his compatriot , who barely registered last season after his £ 30m move from @entity94			2
the @entity95 looked sharp , bright and ready to impress in the first half , before being one of a number of half - time substitutions			0
more to do : @entity2 boss @entity0 watches on during the win , but wants to make signings this week @entity29 was involved in the opening goal ’s build up , sweeping the ball to @entity105 , who in turn moved it on to @entity108			1
the former @entity33 player drove in a cross and @entity48 controlled and finished well on 29 minutes			0
then @entity49 , a second - half substitute , unleashed an excellent strike on 68 minutes which @entity33 keeper @entity112 did well to push away			2
first to react though was @entity50 , diving forward to send a looping header back over goalkeeper for 2 - 0			1
however , @entity2 ’s complacency almost allowed a victory to slip away when @entity118 found room down the left to cross for former @entity2 man @entity121 , who stroked the ball home on 80 minutes			0
@entity124 then got a rare touch on 83 minutes , being forced to dive to his right to touch away @entity129 ’s strike .			0

@entity18 full - back could sign for £ 2.75million in coming week
@entity0 denies deal is done but admits ' it is possible '
@entity2 still *interested* in @entity22 midfielder @entity21
spurs beat @entity33 2 - 1 in final pre-season *friendly*
