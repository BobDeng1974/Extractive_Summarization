click here for all the heat maps and stats from the big clash at the @entity4 @entity5 will no doubt have taken to the @entity4 pitch on saturday with ideas of making former boss @entity8 eat his words as the young striker made his @entity12 debut against @entity13			1
the @entity15 boss allowed the @entity17 striker to leave @entity18 for £ 16million on transfer deadline day before labelling @entity5 as not up to @entity21 's ' standard ' but the @entity23 faithful will disagree after saturday 's performance			1
the 23 - year - old striker may not have been able to find the net , but his energy and movement helped @entity12 to a 2 - 2 draw in north @entity30			1
the game was barely 10 minutes old before @entity5 ran off the shoulder of @entity39 and haired down on @entity44 's goal with a debut goal in his sights			2
as 60,000 @entity12 fans jumped to their feet in anticipation , @entity5 sent a deft chip over @entity44 's head and agonosingly onto the @entity13 post			1
@entity5 worked hard for @entity12 as he led the line for @entity31 's side @entity12 fans join @entity5 with their head in their hands after the striker 's miss @entity5 's seemed to enjoy being allowed to play through the middle for @entity12 it would have been a memorable opener and the @entity12 fans applauded , but they will all have been wishing the former @entity21 striker just put his foot through the ball			1
it 's a trait that seemed to anger @entity21 legend @entity67 , who could n't understand why @entity5 went for such a showboat finish			2
@entity67 told @entity69 : ' when the big chance comes he did n't take it			0
i think it 's to do with ruthlessness ‘ it 's the part of the game he needs to improve			0
he 's not a @entity78 he 's not an @entity79 they would have put them away no doubt			0
he [ @entity78 ] would have put that away			0
’ @entity5 and @entity83 celebrate after @entity84 levelled the score at the @entity4 however , @entity5 did n't let the first half miss play on his mind as he covered ground and made space for the onrushing @entity12 midfield			2
the former @entity93 loanee looked to be thriving in his favoured role and it was his tackle on @entity13 defender @entity38 that eventually led to @entity84 's equalising goal			0
@entity5 did brilliantly to rob @entity38 of the ball before releasing allowing the @entity23 counter-attack which culminated in a brilliant @entity84 leveller			0
the former @entity21 striker was unlucky not to open his @entity12 account shortly afterwards as @entity12 attacked down the right , @entity5 's slight nudge on @entity38 inside the @entity13 penalty area put the big @entity104 off his stride which caused him to miss - time his header and give @entity84 the ball			1
@entity108 headed to the back into the @entity13 box and former @entity112 star @entity111 needed little invitation to strike towards goal and put @entity12 into a 2 - 1 lead after 74 minutes			2
with the score at 2 - 2 , @entity31 brought @entity5 off after 87 minutes to a standing ovation from the @entity23 faithful			0
he may not have hit @entity120 's high ' standard ' just yet , but seemingly already settled in an @entity12 shirt , that ' standard ' does n't seem too far away			0
@entity5 congratulates his @entity12 team - mates after the 2 - 2 draw with @entity13			1
