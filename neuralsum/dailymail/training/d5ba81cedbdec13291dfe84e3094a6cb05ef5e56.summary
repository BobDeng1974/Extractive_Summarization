after the disastrous mid-term elections for president @entity2 and the @entity4 party , the commander in chief could be in dire need of a way to ' shake off ' his party 's failure at the polls			2
the answer could be in this hilarious mash - up song which debuted on the @entity12 with @entity13 on tuesday			1
in the clever clip , a speech by president @entity2 is woven into @entity18 's popular hit song ' shake it off ' and it sounds as though @entity2 is doing the back up vocals for the track			1
however , the song wo n't allow the president to shake off the fact that the @entity40 consolidated their power on @entity42 , picking up more seats than they needed to gain control of the @entity45			0
last night 's results will leave president @entity2 a lame duck for the last two years of his presidency			2
yet , unlike the @entity4 , pop star @entity18 is enjoying a surge in popularity after her new album 1989 notched up the biggest sales week of the last 12 years			0
pressure : this pairing could be the start of a burgeoning new start for the @entity4 after they were defeated at the ballot box			0
