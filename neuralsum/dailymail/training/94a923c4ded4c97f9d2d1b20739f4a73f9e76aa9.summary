by @entity0 published : 03:58 est , 13 may 2013 updated : 09:16 est , 13 may 2013 the company behind a banned advert for a payday lender featuring troubled star @entity4 has re-launched its campaign featuring the formerly bankrupt singer again			1
the promotion for @entity8 was banned by the @entity9 because it appeared to suggest that it was possible to afford a popstar 's lifestyle by using the lender 's services			1
but after a gap of just four days , ms @entity4 is once more appearing on tv in a similar but slightly different version of the @entity8 ad , using the same colour scheme and graphic designs			1
campaigners have criticised payday lenders for using ' glossy adverts and slick celebrity endorsements ' to glamourise their loans , which tend to come with very high interest rates			1
spot the difference : a @entity8 ad , left , featuring @entity4 has been banned ; but the singer still features in publicity for the payday lender , right controversy : the star appears on their website , pictured , even though one of her adverts has been banned ms @entity4 , 32 , who first rose to fame as a member of the recently reunited @entity41 , has run into well - documented personal and financial troubles , and was declared bankrupt in 2008			1
the @entity8 television ads played on the star 's notoriety , and featured her saying : ' we 've all had money troubles at some point , i know i have			1
' you could see your bank and fill in loads of forms , but is there an easier way to get a loan			0
' the company , which is registered under the name @entity59 , offers loans of up to £ 300 a month with an annual percentage rate of 2,760 per cent			0
it tends to charge £ 29 interest per month for every £ 100 borrowed			0
glitzy : the firm was censured for making payday loans appear glamorous by using the star 's image payday loans are designed to provide short - term assistance to people who need cash in an emergency , and should not be used as a routine source of income due to their high interest rates			1
after 29 people complained about the advert , the @entity9 ruled that it was ' irresponsible ' and potentially misleading			2
the agency said that the ad made ' no reference to the fact that these loans were intended for short - term stop gaps between pay day and were not intended as a more immediate solution for more serious financial problems '			0
it also ' had the potential to encourage vulnerable viewers with financial problems and / or restricted credit from seeking to resolve them through the payday loan service ' , according to the @entity9			2
the agency also criticised @entity8 for not displaying the sky - high apr prominently enough , and for using ms @entity4 's personal history to attract customers who are struggling financially			2
reunion : ms @entity4 with her @entity41 bandmates @entity100 and @entity101 earlier this month @entity102 , chief executive of @entity103 , said that advertising like that produced by @entity8 was misleading and potentially exploitative			1
' glossy adverts and slick celebrity endorsements cover up the harsh reality of life in debt , ' she said			1
' behind the glamorous marketing lie extortionate interest rates and charges and the misery of multiple rollover loans			0
' payday loans firms need to do much more to make sure that they treat their customers fairly			0
new evidence from @entity103 found 65 per cent of lenders do not check if borrowers can afford to pay back the loan and many do n't offer to freeze interest or charges if people are struggling to keep up repayments			0
' it 's time that high - cost lenders face up to their responsibilities and tell their customers the truth			0
' the new ad is entirely legal because it has been tweaked slightly to make it different to the banned version			0
it could , however , be banned in the future if viewers complain to the @entity9 and the complaints are upheld			2
troubled : the singer was filmed talking incoherently and slurring her words on this morning in 2008 the company today defended its use of ms @entity4 and insisted it had complied with the @entity9 's instructions			2
' the version of the advert which is currently being aired does not refer to @entity4 's financial history or compare payday loan applications to high street bank loans , which were the issues that the @entity9 criticised , ' a spokesman said			1
' the @entity9 did not have issue with @entity4 being part of the campaign - it was what was said in that specific advert			2
we are looking forward to continuing working with @entity4 , and we are planning on filming an all - new advert soon			0
' we strive to be as compliant as possible and be a responsible part of the payday loans industry			0
' the case is similar to a number of controversies involving budget airline @entity163 , which has repeatedly had its adverts banned only to release similarly controversial publicity materials only days later			1
' it is not our role to ban entire sectors , including payday loans , from advertising or to outlaw the use of celebrities in ads , ' the agency told the @entity175			0
ms @entity4 joined @entity41 , whose hits included @entity177 and @entity178 , at the age of just 18 , but left the band after becoming pregnant by @entity182 star @entity181			2
the mother of four appeared on i 'm a celebrity ... @entity185 ! among a number of reality tv shows , and is also known for her works in adverts for @entity190			1
in 2008 , she was declared bankrupt after failing to pay her taxes properly , and the next year was dropped by some of her employers when pictures were published which allegedly showed her taking cocaine .			0

former @entity41 star appeared in ad for payday lender @entity8
@entity9 ordered firm to pull advert which mentioned @entity204 's money troubles
but just a few days later a similar ad is back on tv despite the ban
new publicity uses identical colour schemes and keeps @entity204 as star
campaigners attack ' glossy adverts and slick celebrity endorsements '
