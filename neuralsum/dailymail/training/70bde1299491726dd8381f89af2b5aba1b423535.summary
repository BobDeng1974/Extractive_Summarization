@entity0 was discreetly seated a few rows back from @entity2 , wrapped against the almost wintry chill of the @entity4 ’s first week , as @entity5 began his @entity4 campaign with an otherwise forgettable win over a @entity8 named @entity9			1
this , it turns out , will go down as the start of another remarkable development in a remarkable career in which the 27 - year - old @entity15 has often shown the propensity to break new ground			1
after all , he took on @entity19 when the great @entity20 had minimal coaching experience , and set a trend that many of his rivals would follow for big - name hirings			1
appointment : @entity5 , training on sunday at @entity29 , has appointed @entity0 as his new coach top job : the two - time @entity33 winner will take over in time for @entity29 's that ended with the biggest breakthrough of all , becoming the first @entity37 man since @entity38 to win the @entity39 and @entity40			1
now he has done it again			0
flouting convention , he announced on sunday — with the tennis world agog — that @entity0 would be his new coach for the grass - court season and almost certainly beyond			1
with the @entity47 looking on for the @entity49 match , it was notable that @entity5 was mentally dialled in from the start			1
he attacked the first - round tie with the focus that was so often apparent when @entity19 would sit , solemn and emotionless , in his box			1
' excited ' : @entity5 said @entity0 was someone he ' always looked up to and admired ' @entity54 : @entity0 won @entity40 in 2006 and the @entity55 in the same year @entity56 : @entity57 became the first female manager of a professional football club in @entity47 after being appointed by @entity60 @entity61 in may this year			1
she had previously managed the women ’s national teams of @entity64 and @entity65			0
@entity61 player @entity66 said : “ it will be a unique experience ... it creates a buzz			2
” @entity70 : @entity71 made history in 2003 by becoming the first woman to coach a men ’s top - level @entity75 basketball team			1
she took charge of @entity80 ’s tigers for one game when the regular coach was suspended mid-season			0
the @entity79 lost , and @entity71 reverted to her role as the school ’s athletics director			0
@entity87 : @entity89 curler @entity88 won double world and @entity92 gold in her playing career			0
she was appointed coach of @entity97 ’s men ’s team for the @entity98 , where they missed out on a bronze medal in a final stone loss to @entity101			1
@entity88 said : “ if you have a different perspective as a woman , you bring more value			0
” @entity106 : the former @entity108 sprint champion turned to coaching and was never far from husband @entity111 ’s side as he swept to @entity92 gold and silver medals at the @entity114			0
she still works closely with a number of elite male rugby union and hockey players			0
@entity119 : @entity120 became the first female ice hockey coach in the history of the @entity123 when she was named power skating instructor for the @entity125 in 1977			0
she worked with the @entity125 through four @entity126 wins before moving on to become a skating coach with the @entity128			0
when @entity19 departed the scene in march , @entity5 quickly worked out that it would be impossible to find a like - for - like replacement for someone who had given him that marginal edge which all champions seek			1
multiple @entity33 winners from the men ’s game are few in number , and when you look for one who is prepared to return to the treadmill of the circuit — and who is temperamentally suitable — their ranks evaporate altogether			1
and so he thought outside the tramlines , as this intelligent and innovative individual has so often been prepared to do			0
why not look at a woman , and to hell with anyone who might sneer at the notion			0
that is what led him to contact 2006 @entity40 champion @entity0 prior to @entity4 , as @entity154 suggested following the @entity49 match			1
many in men ’s tennis privately look down on the women ’s game , but @entity5 has never been one of them			2
he is intrigued by the @entity160 and , for example , took to @entity162 last week to say how much he had enjoyed watching the emerging @entity164 teenage talent , @entity165			0
of course it is a well - known part of the @entity5 narrative that the driving force in his development was his mother @entity170 , who has one of the shrewdest tennis brains you will ever @entity173 is one of numerous mothers who have had a major impact on bringing their son through to the professional ranks , with all the commitment which that takes , and who have retained a significant influence			1
previous : @entity0 already has experience of coaching man , having worked with @entity186 exit : @entity5 lost to @entity188 in the semi-finals of the @entity4 in @entity190 @entity192 ’s mother @entity191 was another famous example as was @entity195 ’s mother @entity194			1
but it is unprecedented in modern times for a player from the true elite to have a woman from outside the family travelling as a major part of the team			0
there are a couple of current top - 100 players who have put their faith in women as their outright coaches but they are family			0
one is @entity213 ’s @entity212 , who is coached by his mother , and the other is the @entity217 - @entity8 @entity216 , whose coach is his wife @entity218			2
they will be familiar with the few inconveniences such an arrangement brings			0
i remember trying to seek out @entity222 the day before @entity5 played him at the @entity39 last year and seeing his mother waiting on a bench outside the locker room to have a chat as she was obviously not able to enter			2
tonic : @entity5 will have to recover from the thumping he took at the hands of @entity188 @entity0 has experience of what it is like to be a woman in this particular man ’s world			1
she coached @entity47 @entity186 during the 2010 grass - court season , when he won the @entity238 event			1
she is currently captain of the @entity47 @entity240 team ( the opposite number of @entity242 with the @entity101 team ) and was on the support staff of @entity245 when she won @entity40 last year			2
so she knows how to win , and can also empathise with the severe pressures @entity5 faces in being by far and away the best player in the nation that hosts @entity40			2
contact : @entity0 said the pair had been discussing working together for a few weeks long term : @entity0 suggested the pair would team not just on a short team basis @entity216 is coached by his wife , @entity254 , and @entity212 by his mother , @entity255 , while , of high - profile former players , @entity256 was a hugely influential figure in son @entity192 ’s career			1
former top - 10 player @entity260 was coached by @entity261 for virtually his whole career and @entity263 briefly coached @entity264			0
despite winning two other majors , she found it hard to produce at her home @entity33			2
the best she managed at @entity4 was two quarter - final appearances			0
she and @entity5 have much in common			2
away from the court , on which he is ferociously competitive , @entity5 is a thoughtful type with a gentle and sensitive side that would surprise some , and the softly spoken @entity0 is similar			1
you can imagine the two of them being able to communicate well			0
on the technical side she was an unusually fine volleyer among the women and this is a side of his game that @entity5 could do with employing more			2
but there will undoubtedly be sceptics , and @entity5 loves nothing more than proving those wrong			2
he will want to make this work and unless he finds the arrangement deeply unsatisfactory early on they clearly plan for it to continue well beyond @entity40			0
they actually have a tough start together			0
weary from @entity4 , @entity5 has a very quick turnaround from @entity190 on to the grass at the @entity293 this week , and then comes his defence of the @entity40 title			1
what a fascinating journey it promises to be			0
@entity154 's tennis correspondent @entity298 first revealed the possibility of @entity0 taking over as @entity5 's coach on may 27 .			1

@entity302 has appointed two - time @entity33 champion
@entity47 is also a former @entity305 1
@entity5 has been without a coach since splitting with @entity19
@entity0 will take up her new role in time for @entity29 's this week
he said : ' @entity0 brings with ere experience and tactical *expertise* '
@entity0 added she is ' really excited ' to be working with the @entity15
