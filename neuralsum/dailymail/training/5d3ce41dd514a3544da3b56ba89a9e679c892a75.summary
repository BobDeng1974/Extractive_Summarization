@entity1 writer @entity0 tried out the latest exercise trend to hit the @entity3 , naked yoga when i 'm stressed i have two recurring dreams			1
one involves me in an exam hall about to take a paper that i have not revised for			1
the other features me walking down @entity10 with no clothes on			1
i 'm trying to hide but then i see someone from work			1
i wake up in a cold sweat			1
for most us , being naked in public is the stuff of nightmares			1
so why is it that here i am , on a sunday night , about to take my clothes off in front of room full of strangers who have all paid good money to do the same thing ? and not only are we going to take our clothes off – we are going to bend and move ourselves into the most compromising of positions			1
and no , it 's not that kind of a get together			1
it 's the latest fitness trend to hit @entity34 : naked yoga			1
the craze started in the @entity37 where naked yoga classes have got a cult following			1
@entity40 is said to be a fan , while @entity42 featured naked yoga in one of her music videos			1
trendsetting magazine @entity45 featured a whole naked yoga shoot while a high - end naked yoga retreat in @entity49 sold out this summer			1
the idea behind it is that it helps people get over body hang - ups – but surely us @entity54 are too uptight for naked downward dog or sun salutations in the buff ? apparently not			1
yoga teacher @entity59 , founder of @entity60 , says that since she started her naked yoga classes a couple of years ago , the demand has been overwhelming			1
' the feedback from the courses was so overwhelmingly positive right from day one			1
i was blown away , and still am blown away by the messages i receive from people having attended the classes , ' she says			2
' people say they become more accepting of themselves , they get over weight issues , they become less self - conscious and less judgmental of themselves and others			2
although i do n't actively hate my body , i do n't love it either			2
my bum is fat , my thighs wobble , i have cellulite , i have scars			2
i try not to think about it because i know that i 'm very lucky to have a healthy body that works and as a size 12 - 14 , i 'm a very normal size – but the truth is i have a kind of low - grade body - loathing all the time			2
it 's boring and draining			2
if naked yoga can change that , then i 'm willing to try – but i 'm terrified			1
the process is supposed to help participants relax and feel comfortable in their own body my first fear is that everyone will have perfect yoga bodies so when i arrive at the tiny studio in @entity34 i am relieved that everyone looks quite normal			1
we are all ages from twenties to sixties and about two thirds men , one - third women			2
we are all shapes and sizes – from what i can see at least			2
once we are in the dimly lit studio everyone keeps their eyes to themselves			2
the room is warm and there 's a smell of incense and the soft sound of plinky plonky music			2
mirrors and windows are covered and candles flicker			2
we 're told to find a mat , get ' changed ' – ie undressed – and lie down			2
i wo n't lie – it 's embarrassing			2
i find a spot in the shadows , remove my leggings and jumper , take a deep breath as i take off my bra and knickers and lie down quickly			0
i do n't look at the two men on either side of me doing the same			0
it 's amazing what you can block out			0
i work hard telling myself that they were enlightened yogis and not perverts – but the truth is the whole thing feels very strange			0
@entity59 's soothing voice guides us through the postures			0
fortunately the mats are arranged in a horseshoe shape and at a diagonal so that we each face @entity59 but are not looking directly at other people – and nobody is behind you			0
it is also a relief that most of the class is done lying down with eyes closed			0
there 's lots of deep breathing and gentle stretching and lifting of arms and legs from a lying down position			0
in the few minutes i manage to forget i 'm naked it 's surprisingly relaxing			1
the dim lights and soft red candles make the whole thing feel like being in the womb			1
when the moves got a bit more dynamic i do get self - conscious			0
i have moments – when doing the downward dog – where i think , ' what the hell am i doing ? ' but at no point do i get an eye - full			0
i try not to think who might be getting an eye - full of me			0
i treat it all as a mental exercise in not caring what people think			0
this class is more about being in your own body than looking at other people 's			0
and in that semi-dark studio , with @entity59 's soft voice telling us to ' inquire ' into our breath , something quite miraculous happens			0
@entity0 says that she found the experience very effective and the class left her appreciating her figure towards the end of the class , i find that i like being in my own body			1
i 'm not criticising it , hating it , wishing it to be better			0
even when my tummy was hanging down it did n't bother me			0
i marvel at how my body could bend and move , and at my soft droopy skin			0
in the soft candlelight it does n't look so bad			0
@entity59 says this is exactly the benefit of naked yoga			1
she says : ' we have such high and unattainable standards of what our bodies should like			1
people can feel inadequate , insecure and dissatisfied with themselves			1
part of the reason i do naked yoga is to react against these ideals of perfection ... ' our bodies are a wonderful miracle granted to us as human beings , and we spend far too much time criticising them , hiding them away in shame and fear			1
it 's time to love , honour and delight in what our bodies have to offer us			1
' at the end of the class there 's a quiet calm as everyone puts on their clothes and walks to the tube			0
i speak to the lady who was just as nervous as i was , when we walked into class at the beginning			0
' that was n't so bad , was it ? ' she asks me			0
' no , it was n't – actually i liked it , ' i say			0
' me too ! ' she 's grinning now			0
i get home and ca n't quite believe what i 've just done			0
it 's like a dream – but not a bad one this time			0
in fact , it was quite beautiful			0
