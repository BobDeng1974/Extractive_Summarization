by @entity0 published : 13:37 est , 29 november 2012 updated : 15:20 est , 29 november 2012 @entity2 went to ‘ great lengths ’ to woo @entity6 ’s @entity5 newspaper empire prior to the last general election , @entity1 said today			1
the judge added the prime minister ’s closeness to senior executives like @entity12 had created a problem of ‘ public perception ’ , although he accepted there was no ‘ deal ’ of newspaper support for the expectation of policy favours			1
this prompted mr @entity2 to demand an apology from former prime minister @entity22 who said the @entity23 ' struck a deal ' with @entity6 ’s newspapers to gain positive coverage			1
lord @entity1 said the prime minister had been right to accept that politicians had ‘ got too close to the media ’ and that the relationship needed to be set on a ‘ better footing ’			1
' too close ' : lord @entity1 said that @entity2 's close relationship with @entity12 had caused problems with perception politicians will now have to record all contact they have with journalists and publish it			1
he said : ‘ the problem is public perception			1
this section of the report has dealt with too many issues where the public , not knowing any more than it has ( or , i might say , than what it reads in the newspapers ) , has been entitled to worry about the way things have been done and what has been going on			2
‘ a way of conducting relationships with the media which leads to a situation in which a public inquiry is needed to take an objective , not to say forensic , look at the matter in order to reassure the public can not be considered as satisfactory or itself in the public interest			0
‘ mr @entity2 went to great lengths to secure meetings face - to - face with mr @entity6 and other @entity5 executives and editors			1
‘ the benefits of this may have played some part in the outcome but should not be overestimated			0
‘ the evidence does not , of course , establish anything resembling a ‘ deal ’ whereby @entity5 ’s support was traded for the expectation of policy favours			2
’ failure : @entity79 ( left ) should have had more control of his adviser @entity81 ( right ) and his contact with @entity84 lobbyist @entity83 health minister @entity79 is the most senior politician to be directly criticised in the report			0
mr @entity79 was @entity86 in 2011 when he was handed responsibility for the @entity84 bid to buy the whole of @entity90			0
spin : lord @entity1 also criticised @entity93 's spin operation - led by @entity94 he is credited for putting in place ’ wise and effective ’ measures to prove he was handling the bid properly			1
but mr @entity79 is criticised for the way his special advisor @entity81 had significant contact with @entity84 lobbyist @entity83			0
’ mr @entity81 already knew mr @entity83 , and when faced with the intimacy , charm , volume and persistence of mr @entity83 ’s approaches , he was put in an extremely difficult position			0
best practice ... was not followed			0
’ lord @entity109 doubted the wisdom ’ of giving mr @entity81 the job			2
’ the consequential risks were then compounded by the cumulative effects of the lack of explicit clarity in mr @entity81 ’s role , the lack of express instruction that it was clear that he fully understood , and a lack of supervision by mr @entity79			0
’ it all gave a ’ perception of bias ’ , he added			0
concerns over how badly @entity93 's spin operations , led for many years by @entity94 , damaged public confidence in political communications were also raised by @entity1 today			1
in a bid to end the ' wilderness years ' of the 1980s and 1990s @entity93 strayed into territory that some believed marked a breakdown of ' public trust engineered by political self - interest ' , the report said			1
it added : ' if @entity93 did not invent ' spin ' , it nevertheless found itself in an unprecedented place in relation to news management as an agenda item in its own right			2
' on the one hand , its election - winning strategy in 1997 explicitly had in mind the lessons to be learned from the recent past			0
' on the other , there is an obvious question about the extent to which a media strategy of ' neutralising ' those sections of the press which had been hostile to the party in the 1980s and in the run - up to the 1992 general election became a victim of its own success , and resulted in diminishing public confidence in political communications			2

lord @entity1 says @entity164 's relationship with @entity12 was bad for ' public perception '
mr @entity2 was ' too close ' to @entity5 , @entity1 said , but he also *slammed* @entity93 's culture of spin
his *landmark* report *recommends* all meetings between press and politicians should be recorded and published
