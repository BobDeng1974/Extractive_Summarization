by @entity0 it may be a grisly affair , but for centuries , the only way for aspiring medics to learn about anatomy was to dissect corpses			0
now , there is another way , as medical students can use ‘ virtual dissection software ’ to explore the human body in the absence of real corpses , which are in short supply			1
while they may not get the sensation of cutting human flesh , the virtual tool claims to be cheaper and faster than using cadavers			2
a real corpse and the body 's muscles is pictured			0
the @entity33 website shows a demo video and screenshots			0
to use the tool , users must request access from the university the tool provides : the software is called @entity42 and claims to be a ' comprehensive , self - paced learning programme that explores anatomy from four different perspectives , ’ in order to teach students how the body is constructed			1
it even allows people to complete practical dissections and post mortems , as well as being able to see ‘ sections ’ of the human body			2
users can see detailed dissections of real bodies , coloured overlays of specific structures and choose different perspectives from which to view the anatomy they are interested in			1
the @entity62 makers of the learning tool said that users do not need any prior knowledge of anatomy to use the tool , and that labels that pop up over the images can be selected at any level of difficulty			1

the software is called @entity42 and claims to be a ' comprehensive , self - paced earning programme that explores anatomy from four different perspectives , ' which teaches students how the body is constructed			1
here , a tutorial explains how to remove the lungs and identify features behind them the tool was the brainchild of @entity91 , an associate professor at @entity92 - who started his work at @entity94 - in @entity62 and has been 20 years in the making			1
he made the database because the time spent in dissection and tutorials is being reduced in medical schools , and there are typically 80 students sharing each cadaver			2
‘ @entity42 bridges the educational gap by providing students with a detailed anatomy resource to use before , during and after their practicals , ’ according to the website			2
‘ it allows them to make better use of their time and to focus on areas of clinical significance and anatomy relevant to practical procedures			0
’ the tool was developed by @entity91 an associate professor at @entity92 in @entity62 and has been 20 years in the making			1
as well as views of real corpses , it includes x-rays such as this one which shows how men and womens ' pelvises differ professor @entity91 told @entity129 that it takes days to clear away the fat and fibres of a corpse , but this process can be done with a few clicks in the programme and each screen on @entity42 represents a week ’s worth of dissection			1
' the tool can also be used by medical practitioners to explain anatomical issues to patients and its layer - by - layer dissections offer an excellent alternative in countries where dissection is not performed for cultural or other reasons , ’ the company said			2
in the future , it could even be used in the creation of a ‘ virtual human ’ that students can feel , as programmers assign tactile qualities to the database of photos using a programming language			1
professor @entity91 said it takes days to clear away the fat and fibres of a corpse , but this process can be done with a few clicks in the programme and each screen on @entity42 represents a week 's worth of dissection			2
here , different tissues are coloured in the pelvic wall the tool can also be used by medical practitioners to explain anatomical issues to patients			0
it includes diagrams of how children develop ( pictured ) , for example the visual database could be used to create a ' virtual human ' that students could feel if programmers assign tactile qualities to photos			1
two experts want to make a human that medical students could see on a screen but feel the sensations of conducting a dissection , from slicing through wobbly fat to moving blood vessels			1
they envisage that such a model would use a model to apply forces and vibrations to a user , replicating the rigidity of a scalpel slicing through flesh , while they are watching footage on a computer screen			0
there is currently no funding for the project , or a date when it could be realised			0
former @entity205 consultant @entity204 , together with a chief executive of a sensing and simulation technology company , plan to use the tool to create a @entity211 virtual human that students can see on a screen and feel the sensations of conducting a dissection , from slicing through wobbly fat to moving blood vessels			1
they envisage that such an innovation would use a model to apply forces and vibrations to a user , replicating the resistance to a scalpel , while they are watching footage on a computer screen			0
dr @entity204 said : ‘ we ’ll offer multi-touch , both - hands haptics which invokes the remarkable human sense of touch , sensitivity and meaning			0
’ ‘ you will feel the texture of skin , the firmness of an athletic muscle or the flabbiness of belly fat , the rigidity of your bony elbow or the pulsatile flow of blood at your wrist pulse point			0
’ while such a project would cost around $ 15million ( £ 8 million ) to develop , the innovators think it could save medical schools money in the long run , as a cadaver lab can cost up to $ 4million ( £ 2.4 million ) to run every year			0
there is no indication when the technology could be realised and the duo have yet to secure investment for their idea			0
the tool allows students to complete practical dissections and post mortems , as well as being able to see ' sections ' of the human body			2
this screenshot shows a woman 's pelvic cavity , including the ureter and ovary			0

@entity42 was built for medical students to practice dissections
tool took 20 years to develop by experts at @entity273 and @entity274 , @entity62
corpses are in short supply so the software makes the process easier
users can see detailed dissections and *cross-sections* of real bodies
to use the tool , users must request access from the @entity94
database could one day be used to create a *3d* virtual human that students can feel using haptic *feedback* technology
