today , the hard work paid off as the time - capsule building was re-opened by @entity7 's @entity6			1
@entity6 opened the @entity9 stately home to celebrate the house 's incredible transformation and to mark the seventieth anniversary of the end of the conflict			1
@entity6 re-opened @entity15 in @entity9 that has been restored to the state it was in 1939 @entity15 , a @entity18 property located in the parish of @entity20 and @entity21 , has been transported back in time to 1939 , when @entity23 - based bank @entity22 moved into the building as they were at risk of having their premises demolished in the @entity28			1
the house became one of only two country house banks during the war , the other being the @entity34			0
@entity6 , 80 , opened the newly - refurbished house after a team of 80 volunteers went to extraordinary lengths to recreate the manor , even sourcing two rolls of 75 - year - old toilet paper			1
other fastidious details include @entity2 toothpaste , oil from that era that would have been used in typewriters and the team even made lipstick from boiled beetroot , which was common practice at the time			1
@entity23 - based bank @entity22 moved into the property as they were at risk of having their own building demolished in the @entity28 the house took six months of painstaking restoration to restore it to its former state @entity57 , head of @entity58 at @entity59 who oversaw the project at the @entity18 property , said it was essential to include the tiny , everyday objects in the faithful recreation of the house , which took six months			2
the 37 - year - old said : ' we do need the ephemeral details like toilet paper and i got a bit obsessed with 1940s toilet paper			2
' we searched high and low and eventually some toilet paper came up on @entity74			2
we did eventually get two rolls of wartime loo roll that i was very happy with			2
' @entity6 opened the stately home to celebrate the house 's incredible transformation and to mark the seventieth anniversary of the end of the @entity2 although @entity57 was able to get hold of the hard - to - find product she admits that even when they were available in 1939 , not many people would have had access to it			1
' it 's very rare as , at the time , people would generally not have used it , they would have used scraps of paper or even newspaper in some households			0
' this level of intricate detail has permeated every aspect of the recreation of @entity15			1
sourcing loo rolls : among the objects bought were two rolls of 75 - year - old toilet tissue costing £ 30 each many of the props were sourced online but the team had also received donations from collectors the bathrooms are stocked with toothpaste and toothbrushes from the era			1
even pens and pencils have been found from the 1940s to fill the desks in the house			2
@entity57 says that a lot of the material has been discovered online through six months of research , but they have also been fortunate enough to receive invaluable donations			0
she said : ' there are some things that you do not know that you want and then when you get them they are perfect			0
@entity57 who oversaw the project said it was important to gather everyday items girl of her time : @entity6 would have been just four - years - old in 1939 ' one instance would be 1940s tea that came in a cardboard box in wrapped up packets with hand written notes			2
they had been in somebody 's attic for 70 years and was in a pristine condition			0
' a lot of the items we received were from the kindness of strangers			0
' in order to create a high level of accuracy the team had to be prepared to spend more than one would usually on household items			0
the toilet paper alone cost £ 60 for the two rolls			1
@entity57 says that the project would n't have been possible without people who had decided to preserve such items			0
' there are some glorious people out there that keep everything and if it were n't for people who kept things in their loft or their attics , we would n't have these objects and that window into a world that 's gone			0
' she said finding the everyday items for the house was vital to faithfully recreate the home 's wartime story			0
she added : ' i honed onto things like the toilet paper because it 's ordinary peoples ' lives and that 's important to our story because it 's a mansion where for that period during the war , ordinary people took over this extraordinary place			0
