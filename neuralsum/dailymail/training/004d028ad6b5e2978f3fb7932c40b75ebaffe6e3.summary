by @entity0 stalinist : @entity3 's proposal has been compared to the land grab in @entity5 developers would have their land seized if they fail to build on it , @entity3 said yesterday			1
the @entity10 leader also unveiled plans to allow towns to expand into rural areas , riding roughshod over local objections			1
his proposals were immediately condemned as a ‘ @entity1 land grab ’ and a threat to the countryside			1
mr @entity3 warned of a housing crisis unless 200,000 homes were built a year – twice the current level , and one million over the life of the next parliament			1
but in a move that critics warned would undermine property rights , he said town hall chiefs would get draconian new powers to fine developers who hoard land that has been granted planning permission – or even seize it altogether			1
‘ we ’ll say to private developers , you ca n’t just sit on land and refuse to build , ’ he told @entity10 delegates			1
‘ we will give them a very clear message – either use the land or lose the land – that is what the next @entity10 government will do			1
‘ we ’ll say to local authorities that they have a right to grow , and neighbouring authorities ca n’t just stop them			2
‘ we ’ll identify new towns and garden cities and we ’ll have a clear aim that by the end of the parliament @entity50 will be building 200,000 homes a year , more than at any time in a generation			2
’ a senior aide said @entity10 would ‘ give councils the power to charge developers escalating fees for sitting on land with planning permission to incentivise them to release the land ... and if this does n’t bite , they would be empowered to use compulsory purchase powers to release the land ’			1
the aide said towns such as @entity68 ‘ need to expand ’ but have been ‘ blocked by neighbouring councils ’			2
ovation : delegates were on their feet at the @entity73 , but new policies have been attacked @entity75 , of the @entity76 , condemned the plans , comparing them to @entity79 ’s notorious seizure of land from prosperous @entity81 known as the @entity82			1
‘ mr @entity3 ’s “ use it or lose it ” declaration is a @entity1 attack on property rights , ’ he said			1
‘ the fundamental problem with the housing market is the public sector planning system , not private sector builders			2
' it ’s hard to imagine a more statist solution to a problem caused by the state			2
’ @entity93 , of the @entity94 , backed moves to make developers build on brownfield sites with planning permission to prevent further development on greenfield land			1
but he condemned the ‘ right to grow ’ as a threat to the countryside			2
‘ if they are really saying that regardless of environmental considerations and the wishes of local people , towns can expand in the face of objections from neighbouring authorities , that is going to get them in very hot water			0
‘ that will end up raising hackles and i do n’t think they ’re going to be able to deliver it			0
’ @entity121 chairman @entity120 pointed out that @entity10 has failed to meet previous pledges to build more homes			1
he said : ‘ the last @entity10 prime minister famously promised three million homes by 2020 and ten eco-towns			0
‘ instead the @entity10 government presided over a housing boom and bust which saw the house building industry brought to its knees			0
‘ yet again , instead of supporting our policies which will help thousands of hardworking families take their first step on the ladder and backing planning reforms which are bringing through much needed planning permissions , @entity3 is offering only more empty promises based on more borrowing and more debt			0
’ in 2007 , mr @entity3 ’s predecessor @entity142 set a target of building 240,000 new homes a year by 2016			0
he said he would make house - building a ‘ national priority ’ , as it was in the inter-war years and the 1950s			1
he set an overall target of three million new homes by 2020			0
at the time , @entity121 leader @entity150 accused mr @entity142 of recycling old policies , saying that he had made similar promises on four occasions since 1994			1
but for every year before 2007 , @entity10 had built fewer social houses than when the @entity121 were in office			0
mr @entity142 had promised to speed up the planning process and to bring surplus public land into housing use			1
@entity159 @entity160 : mr @entity161 has compared atmosphere to 1930s @entity163 online porn should be blocked automatically to protect society from ‘ bestial activities ’ , according to @entity161			0
the former home secretary supported the opt - in system backed by the @entity169			2
under this , internet pornography would be blocked unless customers ask their internet service providers to lift the controls			0
speaking at an event run by the think - tank demos , mr @entity161 said : ‘ i think we have a job in this country , in a civilised , free , open democracy , to protect ourselves from the most bestial activities and from dangers that would undermine a civilised nation			2
’ mr @entity161 also likened today ’s lax moral climate to the atmosphere in @entity185 under which the @entity186 flourished			0
‘ in the late 1920s and early 1930s , @entity163 came as near as dammit to @entity160 , ’ he said			0
‘ there was a disintegration of what you might call any kind of social order			0
’ @entity193 , @entity10 ’s media spokesman , stressed that the internet should be regulated			0
she said it ‘ should not be like the forest in the 13th century ’ where bandits operated ‘ outside the law ’			0
‘ that was not a sustainable position then and it ’s not a sustainable position now , ’ she added .			0
