@entity1 ’s start to his career at @entity3 may not have been as smooth as he had wished – but one @entity4 has thrived since arriving in @entity5 this summer			2
@entity7 ’s @entity6 are flying high in the @entity8 and are third in the table and go into saturday ’s clash with @entity11 on the back of the 8 - 0 thrashing of @entity14			1
the two @entity15 have history having worked together at both @entity17 and @entity18 and have been known to have had a frosty relationship			1
the pair will meet for first time in december at @entity36 ’s and @entity7 says it will be a special occasion			2
speaking to @entity38 , he said : ‘ we have worked together , first when i was his assistant at @entity17 and he was the head coach			2
‘ then , during my period with @entity18 as the coach , he came in after two seasons as technical director and we had some fights about the coaching structure , the way of doing things and that was a problem at the time			0
@entity7 worked as @entity51 's assistant at @entity17 back in the late 1990s ‘ but it ’s not like that anymore – it ’s in the past			1
i have my job to do at @entity6 , he has his job to do at @entity3 and , of course , it will be a little bit special when we play against them			0
‘ it will be two @entity4 coaches facing each other in the @entity8 and i hope the best for him and for @entity3			0
they are a club who have to be at the top and he has achieved great things as a manager in the past			0
’ before @entity7 and @entity51 meet , @entity6 face back - to - back games with @entity11 in the @entity8 and @entity71			1
@entity72 and @entity73 celebrate during @entity6 's 8 - 0 win over @entity14 and if @entity6 are to continue their good form , a lot could rely on the form of £ 10.9million signing @entity72			1
the @entity79 playmaker set up four of the @entity6 eight goals against @entity14 last week and has been one of the players of the season so far			0
but the @entity6 boss admits he was surprised to land @entity72			1
@entity7 added : ' i was always confident about @entity72 because he has exceptional qualities			1
his assists , his goals , his feel for the game belongs on the big stages			0
but i did n’t expect to sign him for @entity6 , i was surprised when he came here			0
i thought we would be fighting against bigger clubs			0
