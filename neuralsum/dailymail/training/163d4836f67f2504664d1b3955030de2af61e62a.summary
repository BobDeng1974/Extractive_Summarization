bewildered householders in @entity7 have had hundreds of pounds in cash posted anonymously through their doors			0
the recipients all live on the same road in the @entity13 town – and were stunned when the mystery money dropped on to their doormats among the usual daily post			1
shock : @entity18 , 58 , said she has been ¿ going crazy ¿ trying to work out who would want to send her £ 200 @entity18 , 58 , said she has been ‘ going crazy ’ trying to work out who would want to send her £ 200			1
her neighbour has also received an envelope containing £ 100 , again with no note or name on it			1
mrs @entity18 said : ‘ i was shocked when i opened the envelope			2
i just thought it would be an invitation or something like that – it really is driving us nuts because we have no idea who is sending it			0
‘ it is lovely but i would like to thank them for it			0
’ mrs @entity18 ’s cash arrived in an envelope measuring 6in by 6in and was folded inside a sheet of lined writing paper			1
the postmark was smudged – but her neighbour ’s cash came in an envelope posted within the region			2
the mystery deepened when mrs @entity18 ’s brother - in - law , who also used to live in @entity47 , was gifted £ 200 which was sent to his address in the nearby village of @entity51			1
he moved in 1979 – so the mystery mailer appears to know the people he or she is sending the bank notes to			0
@entity56 , 86 , who received the cash in £ 20 notes , said the only link between the three recipients was that they had all lived in the road mrs @entity18 added : ‘ from the writing on the envelope it looks like an elderly person , possibly female , but we have no idea who it is			1
‘ whoever sent it knew my brother - in - law had moved and knew his new address			2
’ mrs @entity18 has even contacted friends and former neighbours in a bid to solve the riddle but so far no - one has confessed to being the generous donor			2

the mystery deepened when mrs @entity82 s brother - in - law , who used to live in @entity47 , was sent £ 200 she would n’t even have known there were other people who had been sent the cash by the mystery benefactor if a friend of hers had n’t mentioned what had happened to an acquaintance of mrs @entity18			1
she added : ‘ i know @entity18 but we ’re not really friends and we do n’t go out together			0
and i do n’t know her brother - in - law at all			2
’ the retired office worker receives a state pension and modest private pension and said she had n’t mentioned needing money to anyone as she was fairly ‘ comfortable ’			0
@entity100 last night confirmed a code on the postmark from mrs @entity56 ’s letter showed it had been collected from a post box somewhere in the @entity106 area			0
the details were indecipherable on mrs @entity18 ’s letter , although the handwriting suggests they were sent by the same person			1
