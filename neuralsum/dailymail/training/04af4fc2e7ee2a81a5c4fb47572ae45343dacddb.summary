the deadly ebola virus could be used by terrorists to create a dirty bomb capable of killing large numbers of people in the @entity7 , a @entity1 disease expert has warned			1
as fears grow over the spread of the disease across parts of @entity13 , biological anthropologist dr @entity8 said that although the risk of it reaching the @entity7 was small , a group such as @entity15 could use the virus to create a weapon			1
there is currently no vaccine and no cure for @entity23 , which kills up to 90 per cent of its victims			1
threat : the deadly ebola virus , which medics are trying to contain in @entity13 ( pictured ) , could be used by terrorists to create a dirty bomb capable of killing large numbers of people , a @entity1 disease expert has dr @entity8 has warned although there have been calls for the introduction of fever - screening cameras at @entity7 airports in the wake of the current outbreak , dr @entity31 told a newspaper that should an infected air passenger unwittingly bring @entity23 to @entity7 , medical experts would be able to stop the virus spreading further			1
' a bigger and more serious risk is that a group manages to harness the virus as a power , then explodes it as a bomb in a highly populated public area , ' dr @entity31 told @entity50 on sunday			1
' it could cause a large number of horrific deaths			1
' only a handful of labs worldwide have the ebola virus and they are extremely well - protected			2
so the risk is that a terrorist group seeks to obtain the virus out in @entity13			1
' the current outbreak of @entity23 has already claimed 729 deaths from 1329 confirmed cases in the @entity13 countries of @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68			1
the fatality rate in the current epidemic is about 60 per cent			0
risk : dr @entity31 said that as only a handful of labs worldwide have the ebola virus ( pictured under a microscope ) , terrorists could try to obtain it in @entity13 the outbreak is unusual for @entity13 as the disease is typically found in the center and east of the continent			1
early symptoms of an @entity23 infection include fever , headache , muscle aches and sore throat , while in the later stages of the disease victims begin bleeding both internally and externally , often through the nose and ears , and suffer organ failure			1
among those infected are @entity94 doctor dr @entity93 , 33 , who contracted the virus while in @entity68			2
he has been brought back to the @entity94 for treatment in a special isolation ward , and was today said to be improving			0
however , the top @entity94 health official dr @entity98 , director of the @entity99 in @entity100 , has said it was still too soon to predict whether he would survive			2
a second @entity94 aid worker who contracted @entity23 while working in the same facility as @entity93 , 59 - year - old missionary @entity102 , will be brought to the @entity94 on a later flight as the medical aircraft is equipped to carry only one patient at a time			2
hope : @entity68 @entity109 pray for @entity111 's divine intervention in the eradication of @entity23 at their church in @entity114 today anger : @entity68 stage a protest against the use of their home town pf @entity120 to bury the victims of the ebola virus symptoms : early symptoms of an @entity23 infection include fever , headache , muscle aches and sore throat , while in the later stages of the disease victims begin bleeding both internally and externally			1
pictured are military police deployed at the burial site for victims in @entity120 the virus is not airborne and is transmitted through direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person			2
however , @entity140 director - general @entity139 has warned the virus is currently moving faster than efforts to control it			0
she said : ‘ this outbreak is moving faster than our efforts to control it			0
if the situation continues to deteriorate , the consequences can be catastrophic in terms of lost lives , severe socioeconomic disruption and a high risk of spread to other countries			0
’ speaking at a meeting in @entity65 ’s capital @entity158 , she told the presidents of @entity65 , @entity68 , @entity66 and @entity160 that the virus could be stopped , but warned that some cultural practices such as traditional burials were helping it to spread			0
emirates , the @entity167 's largest airline , said today it had halted flights to @entity65 because of concerns about the spread of the ebola virus			0
treatment : @entity173 in @entity100 , where @entity94 ebola victim dr @entity93 is being treated responding : reporters gather at the entrance to the hospital after an ambulance transporting dr @entity93 arrives			0
he was said to be responding well to treatment , although experts say it is too early to tell if he will survive the @entity183 - based carrier said flights to the @entity65 capital of @entity158 were suspended beginning saturday until further notice			0
the airline will continue flying to the @entity13 nation of @entity190 , which borders @entity65 , saying it ' will be guided by the updates from international health authorities '			0
the @entity193 refused to confirm if @entity7 citizens who contract the virus abroad would be flown back for treatment , saying only : ‘ procedures are in place but we are not going to speculate on what we would do in any individual case			1
’ @entity202 mp and chairman of the @entity204 has urged ministers to consider introducing fever - screening cameras at @entity7 airports as up to 10,000 passengers arrive in the @entity7 every week on 30 direct flights from @entity13			2
@entity210 , which has fewer direct flights from the region than the @entity7 , introduced infra - red thermal imaging cameras at two major airports in april , in an early response to the ebola threat , while @entity66 , @entity65 , @entity217 , and @entity67 have pledged to introduce temperature screening at airports			2
however critics say the cameras can give ‘ false positives ’ – including people with minor illnesses and those who are hot after a dash through the airport			0
mr @entity228 said : ‘ as far as i ’m concerned any measures – including additional screening – which are felt necessary to reassure the public should be taken			0
‘ prevention is always better than cure : we do n’t want to have our first taste of ebola before taking action			0
