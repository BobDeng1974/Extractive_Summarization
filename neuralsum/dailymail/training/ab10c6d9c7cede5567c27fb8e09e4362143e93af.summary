he has spent the past 30 years living in the @entity14 ’s smallest in both size and population and reputably the second smallest in the world			1
his labour of love began as a hobby but after painting dozens of friends and family he decided to keep going until he has captured every last resident			0
eventually mr @entity8 plans to merge them all together as one giant panorama capturing all walks of life			0
@entity41 has painted oil portraits of people in @entity11 from its councillors and bishops to children , housewives and students he said : ' i began painting residents in @entity11 around 14 years ago			1
the original concept was to paint a few people and then put the portraits together as one large image			1
' but after i painted just over 100 portraits i thought if i concentrate more it would be possible to paint the whole city			1
' @entity11 is a very special place and a unique city			2
people from all walks of life integrate and live alongside one another			2
' i have been accepted into the community and i love it here - this is my way of paying tribute to the place i call home			2

pleased with the results : resident @entity88 ( left ) and student @entity90 , 24 , hold their portraits ' i tend to approach people to see if they would be happy to sit , but occasionally someone will ask for me to do a portrait of them			2
' most people are intrigued and really positive about it			0
i do every portrait from a sitting so each one is personalised			0
it ’s nice to have the time to get to know that individual a little better			0
' when it ’s finished it will look from a distance like one giant piece of work			0
but when you look closer you will be able to see each individual ’s portrait and identity			0
artist @entity41 works on a portrait in his home town of @entity11 in @entity12 mr @entity8 says each small portrait can take between 45 minutes and four hours ' the collection is an eclectic viewpoint which reflects the diversity of the whole city from all walks of life			1
