@entity0 has a ' secret plan ' to cut taxes for millionaires after the general election , @entity5 claimed today as @entity6 ramped up its attack on the eighth day of campaigning			1
the @entity6 shadow chancellor unveiled a poster claiming voters had lost £ 1,100 each due to tax and benefit changes under the coalition with ' millions paying more while millionaires pay less '			1
but the prime minister hailed today as ' money - back monday ' - with a raft of tax changes coming into force putting more cash in voters ' wallets			1
but , speaking in @entity25 this morning , mr @entity5 predicted that a @entity35 government would hike vat - something mr @entity0 has explicitly ruled out - and cut the top rate of income tax for earnings over £ 150,000 from 45p to 40p			1
@entity35 treasury minister @entity40 hit back with an accusation that @entity6 has a secret plan to boost revenues by dragging more workers into the 40p higher rate of income tax and increasing national insurance contributions			2
@entity48 leader @entity48 blasted @entity6 's policies as ' economically illiterate ' , but also warned that chancellor @entity50 was ' a very dangerous man ' because of his plan to balance the books by spending cuts alone			0
mr @entity0 and mr @entity50 , who cut the top rate of income tax from 50p to 45p in his @entity57 , each refused to rule out a further cut to 40p in comments on sunday			1
they are expected to come under further pressure on the issue during campaigning in the @entity62			0
the @entity6 shadow chancellor unveiled a poster claiming voters had lost £ 1,100 each due to tax and benefit changes under the coalition with ' millions paying more while millionaires pay less ' mr @entity5 predicted that a @entity35 government would hike vat - something mr @entity0 has explicitly ruled out - and cut the top rate of income tax for earnings over £ 150,000 from 45p to 40p mr @entity5 said : ' we know that is their secret plan - another big tax cut for millionaires			1
' how can it be fair when families here in @entity25 and across the country are struggling and £ 1,100 a year worse - off ? ' how can it be fair to have a tax cut for the very richest when our @entity84 is in crisis and going backwards ? ' how can this be fair when we need to get the deficit down and the @entity27 are now planning deeper cuts in the next three years than the last five ? ' mr @entity5 said a cut in the top rate to 40p would save someone earning £ 1 million a year £ 340,000 over the course of the next @entity93 , while someone with income of £ 5 million would get a total tax cut of £ 1.94 million over the five - year period			1
meanwhile , he said that unfunded conservative plans to cut £ 10 million from income tax by raising thresholds for the 20p and 40p rates would require the equivalent of a two - point rise in @entity104 , costing an average couple with children £ 1,440 over four years			0
@entity48 leader @entity48 meets supporters at the @entity108 while out campaigning in @entity109 , @entity110 @entity48 leader @entity48 blasted @entity6 's policies as ' economically illiterate ' , but also warned that chancellor @entity50 was ' a very dangerous man ' voters would not believe mr @entity0 's denial that he intends to increase the consumption tax , because conservatives had ' a track record of breaking their promises on vat ' , he said			1
however , conservatives claimed secret @entity6 plans for tax rises would cost each working family more than £ 3,000 over the course of the next five years - an estimate which was dismissed as unfounded by independent economists at the @entity125 a week ago			1
mr @entity40 said : ' @entity5 and @entity127 must set out the details of their secret plan for @entity131 , 028 of tax rises on every working family - the @entity134 people have a right to know what these tax hikes are			1
the choice at this election is clear			0
or higher taxes under @entity127 and the @entity142			0
' mr @entity5 insisted that @entity6 will not raise vat , national insurance or the basic and higher rates of income tax if it wins the general election			2
but he confirmed that the party would restore the 50p top rate for earnings over £ 150,000 , as well as imposing a mansion tax , a levy on tobacco companies and closing tax loopholes			2
mr @entity48 hit out at both sides and warned only his party can ensure a balanced plan to clear the deficit			0
he said millions of people would get a tax cut worth almost £ 400 from a @entity48 pledge to push the income tax personal allowance to £ 12,500			0
by contrast , @entity6 's plan to reintroduce the 10p starter rate of income tax would be worth just £ 37 to taxpayers			2
' @entity6 's short - term economic plan will lead to mounting borrowing and leave taxpayers short by hundreds of pounds , which is unfair and reckless , ' said mr @entity48 , who was campaigning in @entity174 and the @entity62			0
' @entity5 and @entity127 's tax plans are economically illiterate			0
@entity6 has already failed to commit the £ 8 billion needed for the @entity84 , and are now failing to give taxpayers the tax cut they deserve			0
' mr @entity48 met @entity178 - aged just seven months - and her mother @entity179 while out campaigning in @entity109 mr @entity5 said : ' all of our plans are fully costed and paid for			0
none of our manifesto commitments will require a single pound of extra borrowing ... ' so this is the choice at the election , a choice between a @entity35 which has a track record of breaking their promises on vat and will raise it again after the election or a @entity6 which has never raised vat and will not raise vat in the next @entity93			0
' a @entity35 way which means millions pay more while millionaires pay less , or @entity6 's plan to back millions of working people , save our nhs and balance the books in a fair way			1
' elsewhere on the campaign trail , @entity203 leader @entity202 was concentrating on his own constituency of @entity206 , where a weekend poll suggested he was trailing in second place in the close three - way marginal			0
on a campaign visit to @entity109 , south - west @entity110 , mr @entity48 said that @entity48 had blocked @entity35 plans to cut the top rate of income tax from 50p to 40p during the coalition			1
conservative ministers were ' always more interested in tax cuts for people at the top rather than tax cuts for people at the bottom or the middle ' , mr @entity48 told @entity221			2
' i was very amused yesterday to hear @entity50 and @entity0 saying with earnest sincerity that they had no plan of giving further tax cuts to people at the top because , i tell you , they had exactly that plan in government and it was something that we said we would not go along with			2
' mr @entity48 's comments came after @entity48 chief secretary to the treasury @entity236 told @entity237 that during coalition negotiations over tax cuts , a conservative minister told him : ' you take care of the workers and we 'll take care of the bosses			2
