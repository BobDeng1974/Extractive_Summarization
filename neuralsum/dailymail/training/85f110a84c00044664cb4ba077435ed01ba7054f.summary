by @entity0 published : 05:38 est , 31 may 2012 updated : 07:24 est , 31 may 2012 a man whose wheelie bin was ' too heavy ' to be emptied was stunned when a council worker told him to take his rubbish to the tip on a bus			1
father - of - one @entity7 said he was given the astonishing instruction when he phoned @entity9 to find out why binmen had n't taken away his household rubbish			1
after being told his bin could break the rubbish cart , he was astonished when the council worker informed him : ' you will have to get a bus			1
' astonishing answer : father - of - one @entity7 said he was given the astonishing instruction to take the bin on the bus when he phoned @entity9 to find out why binmen had n't taken away his household rubbish red - faced council bosses have since apologised to mr @entity7 after admitting the comment was ' inappropriate '			1
the 25 - year - old , who lives with his pregnant girlfriend @entity24 , 24 , and their 22 - month - old son @entity25 in @entity27 , @entity28 , said : ' when i saw our wheelie bin had n't been emptied i phoned the council to ask why and was told it was because our bin was too heavy and would break the dust cart			2
' i said to the woman , well what do you suggest i do with the rubbish if they wo n't take it away and she told me the only thing i could do was take it myself to the local tip. ' my nearest tip is a mile - and - a - half away			2
i do n't have a car , so i said to her the only way i could possibly get there was to get on the bus			0
' she replied : ' well , if needs must , you will have to get a bus			0
' unhappy customer : mr @entity7 lives a nearly two miles from the dump and ca n't drive so he was shocked when the suggestion to take the bin on the bus was made ' i just laughed at her			1
no bus driver would let me on their bus with a wheelie bin			2
and if the wheelie bin was too heavy for the binmen to empty , then how did she think i was going to take it with me on a bus to the tip ? ' i could n't believe it			2
what planet is this woman living on ? what she was suggesting is so ridiculous i find it funny			0

heavy load : @entity9 says it operates fortnightly collections for household waste , but is unable to empty wheelie bins that are too heavy for binmen to lift mr @entity7 , an unemployed carpet fitter , said : ' i told the woman on the phone there was no way i could get the rubbish to the tip and she had to arrange for someone to come round and collect it			1
' i phoned back another three times that day to see what they were doing about it , but got nowhere			0
' then the next morning i woke up to find some purple sacks and been stuffed through our letter box with a leaflet saying i 'd have to take our rubbish out of the wheelie bin , put it in these purple sacks and leave them out the front of the house until the next collection			0
' i ca n't believe they expect us to leave our rubbish on the street for two weeks			0
there are dirty nappies and old food in the rubbish - we 'll be getting maggots , rats and all sorts			0
' i 'm really not happy , but i do n't know what else i can do			0
' @entity115 , the council 's head of neighbourhood services , said : ' we 're sorry if mr @entity7 feels that he was spoken to inappropriately and that his situation was not taken seriously when he called about his bin not being emptied			1
' i have spoken to mr @entity7 today and arrangements have been made to take away all of his rubbish tomorrow			1
