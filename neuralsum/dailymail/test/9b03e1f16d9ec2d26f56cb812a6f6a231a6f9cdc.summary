a science lecturer determined to teach people about different brain regions has shaved her head during an educational video			1
the clip shows @entity6 , a professor at the @entity7 , chopping at her shoulder - length bob with scissors just a few seconds into a lecture			2
a graduate student then uses an electronic razor to shave the rest off , with piles of hair left on a bench in front of a projector			0
the short video was posted on the scientist 's @entity21 website , which is designed to teach people about the different methods of studying the brain			1
ms @entity6 , 56 , said : ' i thought it would be a fun way to draw attention to my site where i have posted lots of short videos talking about the cool things we have learned about the human mind and brain			1
' there is a lot of silly stuff about the human mind on the web that misses out on the real science - and that is a shame because the real science is just as exciting			0
' in just the last couple of decades we have discovered some truly fundamental and exciting things about the human mind and brain			0
' during the footage ms @entity6 is heard explaining : ' it is hard to tell [ what the different regions are ] with all this hair in the way so let 's take care of that			2
' after the haircut the student used permanent markers to draw the different brain regions on ms @entity6 's bare scalp			1
@entity6 ( left ; right ) , a professor at the @entity7 , shaved her head during a lesson about different brain regions after the haircut a student used a permanent marker to draw the different brain regions on ms @entity6 's bare scalp ( above ) the professor introduced the ' cool part of the brain ' - the cortex - before highlighting the area that specifically responds to faces			1
she also points out the regions that react to bodies , places and languages , as well as one that is only used when a person is thinking about what someone else is thinking			0
it is not the first time the professor has played an active role in one of her educational videos			0
in another she allowed her brain to be zapped with transcranial magnetic stimulation - a noninvasive method used to stimulate small regions of the brain			2
ms @entity6 added : ' i hope to keep expanding the site to cover other new topics - when i think up wacky ways to dramatize science i will do them			0

@entity6 works at the @entity7
she used her bare scalp to explain what the different brain regions are
