success is a gloriously familiar routine for @entity2			1
adding gold - plated entries to his personal cv has become an annual exercise – a tradition he is hell - bent on maintaining			2
as he prepared for a @entity11 quarter - final showdown with @entity12 on sunday in @entity13 , @entity15 ’s @entity14 and @entity17 icon reflected on his healthy habit			1
‘ i ’ve been very lucky to have been part of some great sides with @entity22 and @entity23 , and there have n’t been too many years that have gone by that i have n’t been part of a side winning trophies , ’ he said			2
in fact , since the 29 - year - old established himself at senior level , 2010 stands alone as a year without substantial reward			1
there were league titles in 2008 and 2013 , @entity35 in 2009 , 2011 and 2012 , a @entity36 in 2013 , plus the test peaks – @entity39 titles this year and last , and a @entity41 series triumph in @entity42 in 2013			2
@entity2 wants to full the void by winning a medal with @entity15 this season short of helping @entity23 to win the @entity46 later this year , there ’s not much left for @entity2 to achieve , but he wo n’t settle for what he has			1
none of the medals have been earned in the colours of @entity15 , and filling that void in his check - list is a pressing priority			1
with a summer return to @entity55 approaching , @entity2 said : ‘ i was speaking to @entity56 ( @entity57 – former @entity23 team - mate and @entity15 ’s kicking coach ) last week and saying , for me , for my two years here to be a success , we need to pick up a trophy			1
whenever i come back to @entity63 , i want to be able to hold my head up high , say that i gave my best to @entity15 while i was here and helped the club achieve something			1
’ the @entity13 team are in the knock - out stages of @entity72 ’s elite event for the first time , but it is familiar territory for their @entity17 playmaker			1
@entity2 has featured in 11 knock - out games in continental rugby and won the lot			1
it is a proud record that had n’t really occurred to him			0
@entity2 has helped @entity63 side reach the knock - out stages of @entity72 ’s elite event for first time ‘ i had n’t realised that			1
that builds the pressure on me nicely , ’ he quipped			0
‘ i ’ ve never played a knock - out game for @entity15 , so hopefully it ’s going to be one from one ! ’ pressure is no problem to him			1
he handled the scrutiny of being the conductor for the @entity41 and has rarely faltered in conveying a sense of supreme self - belief			2
when @entity22 were staring down the barrel in the @entity97 in @entity98 – trailing 22 - 6 to @entity99 at half - time – @entity2 scored two second - half tries in a 28 - point haul to propel his province to a comeback victory which took an instant place in the folklore of club rugby in the northern hemisphere			1
these days , he is often acclaimed as the world ’s premier fly - half			2
asked about the accolade , he said : ‘ i ’ve worked hard throughout my career to try to get people to think that way of me , so when you hear that it is very nice and you feel that all your work has paid off			0
but you ’re the best one day and the worst the next , so i try to stay grounded			0
i ’ve gone through a lot of ups and downs in my career , so i will keep my feet firmly on the ground			2
’ @entity2 intends to return to @entity55 in the summer after two years in @entity63 in truth , there have been more of the ups than the downs			1
@entity2 had to bide his time to become a fixture in the @entity23 team – serving an impatient apprenticeship behind @entity57			1
the pair were known to have a frosty relationship for a while , based on the fierce contest for the no 10 shirt , so there was surprise when @entity57 followed his younger compatriot to racing as a kicking coach			0
however , the ice has long since thawed			0
there is warmth between them now			0
‘ it was many years ago that we were probably best of enemies , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ i was the young up - start who was trying to get into the @entity17 team , and he was the established international			2
but towards the latter part of his career we became good buddies , as players			0
it ’s been great working with him here			0
@entity56 has been someone for me to bounce stuff off , when things are going well or going badly			0
’ initially , both irishmen struggled to settle in @entity13			1
a lack of fluent @entity63 was a significant issue for @entity2 , as the man charged with orchestrating his @entity167 club ’s attacking game			1
‘ it was very tough at the start , ’ he said			0
‘ when i came over , i did n’t have a great grasp of the language and i play in a position where it really helps to have a good grasp of @entity63			1
‘ for the first four or five months , it was tough			0
i came off the back of the @entity41 tour , i had about two weeks off then started my season straight away , without much of a break			0
so the start was difficult , but then we started to improve as a team and turned things around			0
now it has come full circle			0
i am much more settled and i can speak the language pretty well			0
i ’m going to miss a lot of people here			2
’ last summer , @entity2 agonised over his next career move and eventually resolved to re-join @entity22 , rather than sign another contract with @entity15 – who have made light of the setback by recruiting no less than @entity192 to pick up the baton after the @entity46			1
while he called it a ‘ tough decision ’ , the issue of work - load at key times was decisive for @entity2			1
‘ i have found it extremely difficult to play in the @entity39 and come back in between games to play here , ’ he said			2
‘ i was playing @entity203 games while all the other @entity17 boys were resting in camp			2
’ the additional demands have put a strain on him , but @entity2 has managed to juggle his duties effectively , to keep @entity15 in the hunt in the @entity203 and @entity11 , and help @entity23 retain their @entity39 title , in dramatic fashion – once again edging out @entity212 on points - difference			1
he described super saturday ; the culmination of this year ’s championship , as the ‘ best day in a green jersey ’ for himself and many of his @entity219 colleagues			0
@entity221 helped @entity23 retain the @entity39 title this year all the trophies and medals and plaudits have n’t quelled the fire in him			0
asked to address criticism of @entity23 ’s often pragmatic tactics in the @entity39 – and a lack of tries prior to the torrent against @entity232 on the final day – @entity2 offered a defiant retort			1
‘ there were areas of weakness ( in the opposition ) that we looked to target , ’ he said , referring to an effective @entity17 kicking game			0
‘ after the first three games , there was a perception that we were kicking the arse off the ball , but @entity245 ( @entity247 , @entity23 ’s coach ) said to us that we had passed the ball more than any other team in the competition			0
sometimes perception and reality are miles apart			0
we showed what we could do with ball in hand against @entity256 but we were a bit inaccurate			0
then it clicked against @entity232			0
’ if it clicks again for @entity23 at the @entity46 , they have a growing belief that – driven on by their @entity261 at @entity14 – they can mount a genuine challenge for the @entity265			1
but first , @entity2 will focus on signing off from racing with something to show for his time there			2
the cv has already been embellished this year , but there may be further entries to follow .			0

@entity2 has featured in 11 @entity274 knock - out games and won the lot
@entity15 *'s* @entity14 wants to finish two - year stint in @entity13 with a medal
