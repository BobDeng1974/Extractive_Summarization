by @entity0 published : 04:29 est , 11 july 2013 updated : 06:30 est , 12 july 2013 a teenage beauty queen was left in tears after being banned from her school prom for skipping lessons and bad behaviour			1
@entity6 , 16 , was turned away at the gates in her £ 300 dress after ignoring teachers ’ warnings that she would not be let in			1
she claimed she was left traumatised and deserved to go to the dance because her achievement in reaching the @entity14 finals had given the school a good name			2
blacklisted beauty queen @entity6 , who has reached the finals of @entity18 , wept as she was blocked from entering but staff at @entity20 in @entity21 say that @entity6 – who wants to be a model – missed classes , was often late , swore at teachers and refused to stay behind for detentions			1
‘ she was given two written warnings saying she could n’t go to the prom unless she behaved better at school and each time she ripped them up in front of the teachers , ’ said a source			2
why @entity6 bothered to try to get into the end - of - year dance last week – and let her distress be filmed on a mobile phone – remains a mystery because she was told months ago she would not be let in			1
five days earlier , she had posted on @entity37 : ‘ going to kill me seeing all my girls looking beautiful on friday at prom knowing i ’m not aloud [ sic ]			0
’ her mother called children 's services before the prom in a bid to overturn the school 's ' disgusting ' decision was school right to turn away beauty queen from prom for skipping classes ? yesterday , @entity6 , whose idols include @entity52 from reality tv show @entity53 and @entity54 , was believed to be on holiday in @entity56 with her boyfriend			1
her mother @entity58 , 36 , said she called @entity21 ’s children ’s services before the prom to try to overturn the school ’s ban on @entity64 and to complain her daughter was being ‘ victimised ’			1
‘ i had the dress made by a fashion designer in @entity67 , she was so sure she was going , ’ said mrs @entity6 , of @entity66 , @entity67			0
before going on holiday , @entity6 told her local newspaper : ‘ i deserved to be there [ at the prom ]			2
‘ over the last year i ’ve raised money for charity and represented the school as miss @entity77 and i ’ve given the school a good name			0
in the end all i could do was cry my eyes out , i was so distressed			0
’ @entity6 's mother said the school 's act followed months of ' victimisation ' after her daughter won a beauty crown @entity87 , pictured with mother @entity58 , claims that she had done everything the school had asked her to so that she could attend the dance headmaster @entity91 said : ‘ @entity6 was told she would not be allowed to attend the prom in march			1
’ pupils had decided that it was not an entitlement but a privilege to attend the prom , he said , and a points system was used			0
under it , @entity6 needed 80 points to go to the prom			0
her 87 per cent attendance record gave her 87 points and she gained 13 more for achievement – but she lost 69 points for her bad behaviour , ending on only 31 points			0
it meant that she was one of three pupils to be barred from going to the prom .			0

@entity6 claims her attendance was 91 **%** - teachers said it was 87 **%**
school *policy* is that prom attendees must pass attendance rate
told her in march that she would not be able to attend
year 11 pupil turned up to dance in £ 300 white dress but was turned away
beauty queen , 16 , says she is ' traumatised ' by experience
mother rang children 's services to try and overturn decision
