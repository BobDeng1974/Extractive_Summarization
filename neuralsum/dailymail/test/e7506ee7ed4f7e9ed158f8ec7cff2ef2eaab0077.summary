police believe they are on the verge of solving a brutal cold case murder that occurred 35 years ago			1
@entity3 was just 14 - years - old in 1980 when she and a friend took a ride home from a stranger after finishing the day at @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10 - a town so quaint and wholesome that it was the model for the fictional @entity12 in ' the @entity13			1
' her friend got dropped off first , but @entity3 never made it back home			1
three days later , her partially clothed body was discovered in a heavily wooded area almost 20 miles away from the bowling alley parking lot where she and her friend had hitched a ride			2
she had been violently assaulted and then stabbed to death			0
the man who gave her a ride home that day was never found			1
' within a day or so after receiving her call there were developments that i can not discuss here today , but this task force is actively pursuing good leads , ' @entity34 sheriff @entity33 said in a press conference on monday			1
what they already knew is that the man was in his early twenties back in 1980 , drove a blue pickup truck with a white shell over the bed and went by @entity61 , though he told the girls his friends called him @entity64			0
he would now be in his mid-to - late fifties			2
and while it has been years since the incident , some witnesses have been able to provide better information now than they could at the time the tragedy occurred			0
' this is because they were young when this murder occurred and they feared getting into trouble with their parents or the law ; they are no longer close with those who , in confidence , has discussed the homicide with them , ' explained sheriff @entity33			1
' the witnesses did not realize @entity3 â€™s murder is still an open case			2
' more importantly , police can now test some of the dna evidence from the scene , something they could not do back in 1980 due to a lack of technology			1
@entity3 had been violently assaulted and stabbed to death when her body was found the man was in his early twenties back in 1980 , drove a blue pickup truck ( similar to the one above ) with a white shell over the bed and went by @entity61 , though he told the girls his friends called him @entity64 what 's more , sheriff @entity33 does not think law enforcement has to search far to find the man			1
' we think he lived and still lives in the immediate area , ' he said			0
' we feel like he has blended into the community and he 's lived with this for a long time and we 're hoping he does the right thing and comes forward			0
' and if he does not come forward , sheriff @entity33 has a message for him : ' make no mistake			2
we are coming for you			0
' @entity3 's mother meanwhile just wants closure after years of pain			0
' i want them to be put in prison for the rest of their lives because i 've been in prison , so to speak , for almost 35 years , ' she said			0
