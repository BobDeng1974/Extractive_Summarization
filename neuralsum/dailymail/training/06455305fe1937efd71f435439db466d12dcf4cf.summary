by @entity0 published : 10:22 est , 22 august 2012 updated : 07:11 est , 23 august 2012 when the set of photos apparently showing a naked prince @entity6 cavorting in his hotel suite surfaced last night , the initial reaction for many was one of disbelief			0
firstly , we thought , was n't it unlikely that a member of the @entity13 should strip naked in front of camera - wielding strangers ? even if that member of the @entity13 is the notorious good - time guy , @entity6 ? secondly , we could n't help but recall those ' stolen ' photos taken by photographer @entity17 , famous for mocking up unseemly situations using royal lookalikes			0
in naked photographs of @entity6 that surfaced yesterday the young royal wore a distinctive silver pendant that he had worn on numerous occasions before - and is said to have been a love token from @entity25 indeed , following the royal wedding , @entity26 staged some fake photographs of a cheeky prince @entity6 pinching the bottom of a very realistic @entity31 lookalike			1
could these be some well - timed works from @entity26 ? but on closer examination , we realised - thanks to a very distinctive piece of jewellery - that we were indeed looking at photographs of the third in line to the throne in the altogether			0
the jewellery in question is a silver pendant with a small amber - coloured stone in the middle , and it was reportedly given to the young royal by his ex-girlfriend @entity25 in the early days of their five year relationship			1
@entity6 has been wearing the necklace on and off ever since - the leather thong is frequently seen peeping above the neckline of his shirt - but according to recent reports , the fact that he has returned to wearing it religiously shows the depth of his affection for @entity25			1
for her part , @entity25 is said to reciprocate by wearing a blue topaz ring that was a gift from @entity6			1
love token : @entity25 , pictured here with prince @entity6 in 2007 , is said to have given prince @entity6 the necklace when they first started dating should @entity66 newspapers and websites publish the nude pictures of prince @entity6 in @entity69 ? quite what @entity25 would have made of the circumstances in which the love token ( if it is indeed such a thing ) found itself is another matter - but given the length of time that the relationship has lasted , one can assume she is fairly accepting of his carousing ways			1
the 27 - year - old prince 's on - off relationship with @entity25 , 26 , has spanned seven years in total , and the two are still close			0
@entity25 joined prince @entity6 as recently as 2 may for princess @entity84 's birthday party at @entity85 , and it was reported at the time that the two were in the process of rekindling their romance			0
the couple split when @entity25 decided that following a royal lifestyle was not for her - but with @entity6 wearing the love token so publicly , could yet another rekindled romance be on the cards ? watch this space			2
this necklace has history ... the leather thong of the necklace can be seen at the neckline of his shirt - but the precious pendant was tucked away inside for the majority of @entity6 's @entity107 tour prince @entity6 wore the necklace at the end of last year on a night out at the @entity110 in @entity112 's @entity111 ... and again , just glimpsed , on a night out with friends at @entity115 nightclub in @entity112 indeed , following the royal wedding , @entity26 staged some fake photographs of a cheeky prince @entity6 pinching the bottom of a very realistic @entity31 lookalike			2
