@entity12 , one half of the outspoken ' @entity15 , ' show on @entity16 , was discussing gun control when he made the outrageous comment about the @entity6 , @entity20 tragedy earlier this month			1
' i 'm sick and tired of seeing these victims trotted out , given rides on @entity23 , hauled into the @entity24 well , and everyone is just afraid -- they 're terrified of these victims , ' he said			2
' ... i would stand in front of them and tell them , " go to hell			2
" ' scroll down to listen shocking : @entity12 is one half of the ' @entity15 , ' show on @entity16 the horrific shooting on december 14 , 2012 , left 26 people dead , including 20 six or seven - year - olds			1
@entity12 ' heinous rant , which begins just over six minutes into the above segment , was targeted at the victims ' families , some of which have been vocal in the months since the shooting as advocates for tighter gun controls			1
' i have something i want to say to the victims of @entity6 , or any other shooting , ' @entity12 said , according to @entity52 ' @entity51 blog			1
' i do n't care if it 's here in @entity52 or anyplace else			2
just because a bad thing happened to you does n't mean that you get to put a king in charge of my life			2
i 'm sorry that you suffered a tragedy , but you know what ? deal with it , and do n't force me to lose my liberty , which is a greater tragedy than your loss			0
' the remarks prompted scores of angry comments from shocked listeners , with most claiming the hosts were ' despicable ' and should be ' ashamed ' of themselves			0
families : some of the victims ' families including @entity76 , left , and @entity77 , right , have become vocal gun control advocates since the tragedy horror : the heartbreaking shooting on december 14 , 2012 , left 26 people dead , including 20 six or seven - year - olds one listener wrote on their web page : ' ( this is the ) most unbelievably insensitive thing i have heard , i will never listen to this station again and will encourage all my friends and acquaintances to do the same			0
' another wrote : ' @entity12 and @entity91 and your station should be ashamed of the callous stance taken about guns and @entity6			1
two angry men , who also care nothing for the pain their words cause			0
no one is bothering your " liberty " nor do you have a " king			0
" two immature men who seem smugly satisfied with the venom they spew			0
i hope your sponsors bail on you as fast as they can and your show vanishes			0
you help nothing with your hate			0
' a few days after the vicious tirade , @entity12 addressed his outraged listeners , but stopped short of an apology			1
' ... here 's what you need to know and what some of you already know about me is that , ah , this is not a contrived show , i do not hide behind flowery language i do not pull my punches , when i 'm passionate about something it comes out on the air , it 's real and it will always be that way , ' he said			0
he then characterized his comment as ' an emotional predecessor to a thought which can and will find a more refined expression by me and others in the future , i guarantee you			1
