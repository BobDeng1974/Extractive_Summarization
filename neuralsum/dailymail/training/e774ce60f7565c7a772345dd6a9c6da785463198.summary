by @entity0 published : 03:59 est , 2 august 2012 updated : 04:02 est , 2 august 2012 a quick - thinking doctor saved the life of his pet tortoise after it nearly drowned - by giving it mouth - to - mouth resuscitation			1
the eight - year - old reptile , @entity7 , appeared to have drowned in his water bowl at @entity10 's home in @entity11 , @entity12			1
the horrified family doctor saw the tortoise half submerged in the bowl and picked him up to find he was not breathing			2
one shell of a rescue : @entity10 spent six minutes giving @entity7 mouth to mouth after the animal fell into his water bowl crawling back to life : eight - year - old @entity22 was found half - submerged , with his feet sticking up out of the water bowl but the determined 34 - year - old acted fast , and spent six minutes giving his pet mouth to mouth until the tortoise started breathing again			1
dr @entity10 had been tending his garden when he had walked past @entity7 's run and noticed that his pet was in serious trouble			1
touch and go : dr @entity10 told his two - year - old son @entity33 that their pet had simply ' gone swimming ' in the bowl inside his outdoor run he said : ' i saw his back feet sticking up out of the water			1
i pulled him out but he was not breathing and was completely floppy			0
' i did six minutes of mouth - to - mouth before he slowly started breathing and blinking			2
' the doctor , who works at a gp 's surgery in @entity45 , @entity12 , admitted : ' i was quite emotional at the time			0
' i first started doing it and i had my mouth over his whole head , mouth , nose and nostrils			2
then i changed it to sort of breathing into his nostrils			2
' he has a run outdoors which had some water in a concrete container about ten inches long - the same width as his shell			0
he had just fallen in			0
' dr @entity10 's wife @entity62 had been putting the couple 's two - year - old son @entity33 to bed when her husband saved the life of their pet			1
the doctor told his son that @entity7 had ' been swimming ' because the boy was too young to understand what was really going on			0
the family , who also have a cat , have had @entity7 for a year and dr @entity10 said that to lose him would have been devastating			1
he said : ' when my wife came downstairs she said that @entity7 is supposed to outlive us			0
he is not supposed to die young at eight years old			0
' heroic act : the doctor said his colleagues at the @entity44 's surgery thought the episode was ' hilarious ' tortoises generally have lifespans comparable with those of human beings , and some have lived for more than 150 years			2
the pet owner took @entity7 to the vet to be checked out and he was given antibiotics in case he had any water in his lungs			1
' the guys at work think it is hilarious , ' added the doctor			0
' there is a mixture of laughter and them kind of saying well done for giving it a go			0
