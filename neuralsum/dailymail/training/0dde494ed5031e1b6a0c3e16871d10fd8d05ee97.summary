by @entity0 , @entity1 editor @entity2 is to offer a mass market ‘ no fees ’ current account backed by a £ 100 gift card sweetener in a move that threatens to break up the big bank monopoly			1
independent experts argue the account offers far better value than most of those from the mainstream banks – @entity15 - @entity14 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18			1
benefits include an end to many of the hidden fees which make a nonsense of the claim by the current giants to offer ‘ free banking ’			1
the ' no - fee ' bank account is just another in the frequent ventures into other sales mediums by the high street chain the development poses the biggest threat yet to the dominant finance giants which have an appalling record of rip - offs , bad advice and huge bonuses for fat cat executives			1
at the same time , @entity40 and @entity41 , are also to launch new mass market current accounts in a move which , could , deliver better value and service			1
all have the necessary financial muscle and customer service expertise to pose a serious challenge to the major banks			0
they can also take advantage of a new bank switching regime , which came into effect at the end of last year makes it much easier for people to switch their bank in seven working days personal finance expert , @entity59 , of @entity60 , said : ‘ i think this deal has the potential to drive a lot of new custom from account holders with the big banks who have until now been sitting on the fence , not sure where to switch to for a better deal			2
‘ this latest account is simple and transparent and has many positive features that should appeal to a wide range of consumers			0
’ the @entity2 brand has been branching out in recent years , with hits like the ' @entity2 ' taking off the account comes with a £ 500 overdraft facility of which the first £ 100 is interest and fee free			1
this is a very useful safety net to avoid being hit with big charges when an account dips into the red			0
currently , most of the major banks have a much smaller overdraft buffer of around £ 20 before penalty charges and interest fees are triggered			2
@entity89 on ... @entity2 's latest move into the financial sector the interest rate for overdrafts above the £ 100 mark is 15.9per cent @entity95 , which may appear high when the @entity97 base rate is 0.5per cent but is actually one of the most competitive in the market			1
in another key benefit , there are no unauthorised overdraft charges or fees for returning unpaid cheques or standing orders			0
historically , people can find a small overdraft and debt can balloon into a huge figure because of the penalty charges for bouncing payments like bills			0
most banks impose a charge of 2 - 3per cent when people use their debit card abroad to make purchases or take money out of a cash machine			2
there is also an extra transaction fee , which can be £ 1.50 , for making a cash machine withdrawal			0
the @entity122 will impose a 2.75per cent fee in these circumstances , but there will be no additional transaction fee for a cash withdrawal overseas			0
mr @entity59 said : ‘ the icing on the cake is that you ’ll also receive a £ 100 @entity2 gift card if you transfer your bank account using the current account switch service			1
‘ it looks like a good all round package from a trusted brand with no hidden nasties and is likely to prove popular			0
’ @entity138 high street retailer @entity2 announced on that in 2013 that sales rose in its financial year , despite challenging conditions on the high street no interest is paid on credit balances sitting in the current account , however people can earn reward points at the rate of one pence in the pound for spending in @entity2 stores			1
these are paid quarterly to customers in the form of @entity2 vouchers			2
there is no requirement to pay in a minimum sum of money each month , however customers must move direct debits and standing orders to the new account using the @entity2 switching service and close their existing one			1
the account will be backed up with seven days a week banking in 29 @entity2 stores nationwide and a call centre operating around the clock			1
@entity169 of @entity170 , who surveys financial products , said the simplicity of the new account will appeal to many people			0
‘ at a time when the many different overdraft tariffs and structures in place make overdraft cost comparisons a nightmare for consumers it is a consumer friendly feature to see a competitive and straightforward overdraft rate that does n’t charge fees , ’ he said			0
@entity2 started as a primarily clothes - based store , but since it began it has been going from change to change , and now more resembles a supermarket-esque store that offers everything ‘ this is a good deal for those who regularly shop at @entity2 and its competitive overdraft rate coupled with no insistence upon any minimum monthly funding requirement will also broaden its appeal			1
the @entity122 already offers two current accounts which carry a monthly fee , however the new one will be its first for the mass market without a charge			0
its chief executive , @entity198 , said : ‘ we launched @entity122 in september 2012 on the foundations of @entity201 , which was established 29 - years ’ ago			0
‘ @entity202 , developed specifically for the regular @entity2 shopper , have proven popular with this audience and following the launch of the @entity206 , which has made switching faster and easier , we want to offer the same transparent banking and great service to a broader audience with the launch of the @entity211			1
’ the new @entity211 will be available in the summer , starting with existing customers before rolling - out to others			0
if you 're fed up with your bank and thinking of switching , there are plenty of incentives to @entity220 is @entity223 's five of the best current accounts is a regularly updated guide to where the best offers are			0
top deals include @entity228 's @entity227 promising new customers £ 100 to switch and £ 5 per month if they stay in credit			1
@entity231 pays £ 100 to new customers who switch to its @entity232			2
on top of that , the bank is so confident in its customer service that it will give you a further £ 100 if you chose to close the account within the first 12 months			1
the co-op , too , has introduced a £ 100 cash incentive for new customers			2
it will also donate £ 25 to charity on your behalf			0
if you switch your main current account to one of the @entity248 ’s @entity247 current accounts the bank will give you a £ 100 gift card			1
@entity18 's 123 current account , on the other hand , pays interest on in - credit balances - 1 per cent on balances between £ 1,000 and £ 2,000 , 2 per cent between £ 2,000 and £ 3,000 and 3 per cent on balances between £ 3,000 and £ 20,000			2
@entity257 offers to pay 5 per cent interest on balances up to £ 2,500 for the first year , while its @entity260 delivers free travel insurance			2
it also operates a @entity262 , whereby both parties will receive £ 50 if an existing customers successfully recommends friends or family to the bank			0
