a @entity1 blogger is at the centre of a free speech row after posting an ' offensive ' advert on behalf of a petition against plans to legalise gay marriage			1
advertising watchdogs have demanded an explanation from the writer , known by the pen name @entity12 , after they received 24 complaints			2
the @entity14 is asking that he respond to claims that the message - which asks viewers to ' help us keep the true meaning of marriage ' - is homophobic			1
offensive ? a frame from the advert displayed on the @entity12 blog , which attracted 24 complaints archbishop @entity12 ( pictured ) was the man wrote and compiled the first two editions of the @entity27			1
he was also a reformist who helped build a favourable case for @entity30 's divorce from @entity31 , which resulted in the @entity33 breaking away from the @entity34			0
@entity12 was tried for treason and heresy after @entity37 , a @entity38 , came to the throne			2
imprisoned for more than two years and under pressure from @entity42 authorities , he made several recantations			0
however , on the day of his execution , he withdrew these and died a heretic to @entity38 and a martyr to @entity48			0
archbishop @entity12 featured in @entity52 's @entity51 - winning novel @entity49 , a fictionalised account of the rise to power of @entity56 in the court of @entity30 the @entity59 advert flickers between pictures of heterosexual couples on their wedding day , the phrase ' i do ' and a message citing a market research poll that showed ' 70 % of people say keep marriage as it is '			1
the campaigners behind the petition describe themselves as ' an umbrella group of individuals and organisations in the @entity74 that support traditional marriage and oppose any plans to redefine it '			1
the @entity14 has stressed that the adverts , rather than the blogger , are the subject of their probe - and insist he is not compelled to justify the campaign message			0
however , archbishop @entity12 - who takes his pseudonym from a sixteenth - century reformer - remained adamant that the @entity14 is trying to restrict his and the @entity59 's right to free speech			1
in a post attacking the anonymous complainants he wrote : ' they called in the @entity90 to censor the assertion that marriage is a life - long union between one man and one woman , in accordance with the teaching of the @entity42 , the beliefs of its @entity99 , and the law of the land			0
' fellow ecclesiastical bloggers leapt to his defence and even the @entity104 , which is in favour of legalising same - sex marriage , has stood by him			0
a statement from the society read : ' the @entity104 wants to announce its support for the @entity12 blog			2
although it disagrees with this blogger profoundly on so many issues , it agrees with him entirely that the @entity14 is overstepping the mark and posing a rather sinister threat to freedom of expression			0
' though the @entity104 went on to distance itself from @entity12 and the @entity59 campaign , it argued the complaints made to the @entity14 were ' not reason enough to silence them '			1
the @entity14 today stressed it would not necessarily uphold the complaints , which would lead to the ad being banned			0
probe : the @entity14 is now investigating claims that the advert promotes homophobia it said in a statement : ' the right of advertisers responsibly to express their views will undoubtedly be an important factor in our assessment of whether the ads are likely to cause serious or widespread offence			1
we are also looking at whether the ads are misleading			0
' the authority also responded to @entity12 's outrage over the ' threatening ' way in which it approached him , explaining that : ' we have long found it useful to ask , in confidence , publishers of ads subject to " offence " complaints for their views , because they can give us a valuable insight into whether or not their readers are likely to be offended '			2
of the 24 complaints said to have been lodged , ten took issue with the advert 's allegedly offensive content			0
the rest demanded evidence to back up the claim that seven in ten people do not want any change to marriage laws - but as this figure came from major polling agency @entity159 , the @entity14 did not expect those who posted the advert to provide this .			1

the campaigners behind the petition describe themselves as a group of people ' that support traditional marriage and oppose any plans to redefine it '
@entity14 is investigating claims that the advert promotes homophobia
@entity177 ' @entity12 ' insists @entity14 is trying to restrict his and the @entity59 's right to free speech
