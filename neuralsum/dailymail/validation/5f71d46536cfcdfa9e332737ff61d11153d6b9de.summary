ca n't choose between a bike , scooter or a skateboard for the commute to work ? now you do n't have to , as inventors have come up with a contraption that combines all three into one			1
the device , called a @entity9 , offers riders young and old the ability to enjoy the three modes of transport simulataneously in a bizarre contraption that has cherry - picked features from each			1
it has a set of handlebars and a big front wheel like a bike , but the back section looks more like a skateboard			1
the rider propels themselves as if they were on a scooter			2
the @entity9 ( shown ) is a mix of a bike , scooter and a skateboard			1
it has handlebars and a big front wheel , but the back has a flat section its makers say riding a @entity42 feels nothing like a conventional scooter - instead it is more like ' skiing on a pavement '			1
@entity48 may be known for its cars , but at this year ’s @entity51 the auto giant also unveiled a pair of electric bikes			0
both prototypes are powered by 200 - watt motors , fold to fit on a train or in the boot of a car , and with pedal assist , help riders reach speeds of up to 15mph ( 25km/h )			0
the bikes are part of an experiment by @entity48 called @entity65 , which aims to make journeys safer and more efficient			0
the bikes , called @entity68 : me and @entity68 : @entity70 , are based on designs by @entity48 employees and take inspiration from technology seen in cars			0
for example , both bikes are fitted with rear - facing ultrasonic sensors			0
these sensors link with the handlebars to discreetly alert the rider when a car is about to overtake using subtle vibrations			2
the @entity9 is the brainchild of racing drivers @entity86 and @entity87 from @entity88 who came up with the design as a way to get around the pit lanes at a race track quickly			2
the @entity87 brothers then teamed up with designer @entity94 and together they built the first prototype in @entity94 's garage before launching the product worldwide			0
the @entity9 comes in two main models - a mini one for children under seven and a bigger version for older kids and adults			1
the smaller one costs £ 99.95 ( $ 149 ) and the bigger is £ 159.95 ( $ 249 ) from sbykeuk.co.uk			1
@entity105 from @entity106 , director of @entity9 @entity108 , said : ' the @entity9 is the evolution of the kick scooter - a brand new revolutionary hybrid scooter which takes the best elements from scootering , skateboarding and cycling and rolls them all into one			2
' although it looks a little like a bike , a skateboard and a scooter all mixed together , it rides unlike any of them			2
' @entity42 takes the best attributes of each and combines them into something totally unique			0
' imagine skiing and surfing but on the pavement			0
that 's the sensation @entity42 can give you			0
' the rider , young or old , propels themselves like a scooter			1
the inventors say using it is like ' skiing on a pavement '			2
a smaller version costs £ 99.95 and a bigger version is £ 159.95 the large front wheel supposedly helps propel the @entity9 up to five times further per push than a conventional scooter ( left ) , while a patented rear wheel steer system apparently allows for ' amazingly tight turns ' ( right )			1
@entity142 can also be used to keep it at a standstill @entity105 from @entity106 , director of @entity9 @entity108 , said : ' the @entity9 is the evolution of the kick scooter - a brand new revolutionary hybrid scooter which takes the best elements from scootering , skateboarding and cycling and rolls them all into one ' a patented rear wheel steer system apparently allows for ' amazingly tight turns ' , while a handbrake can also be used to keep it at a standstill			1
the large front wheel , meanwhile , supposedly helps propel the @entity9 up to five times further per push than a conventional scooter			1
' @entity42 is also fabulous for a child 's balance and core strength - once mastered riding one is addictive , ' added mr @entity105			0
' the patented design is portable , easy to control and perfect for use in countless places			0
' the @entity9 can be used for cruising , tricks , commuting , keeping fit , improving balance and just having fun			0
