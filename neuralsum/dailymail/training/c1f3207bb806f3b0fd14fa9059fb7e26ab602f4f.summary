but mr @entity5 said : ‘ i do n’t want to hear their excuses			2
i would like them to give me my money			0
i went in there , asked for the odds which they had to telephone for and made my bets			0

@entity10 won the match 3 - 0 ‘ i had looked at the quality both @entity11 and @entity9 were putting on the pitch and could see they had a good chance of scoring a lot of goals			1
‘ i do n’t want to hear their excuses			0
i would like them to give me my money ' @entity5 ‘ i also saw that @entity17 were unlikely to play @entity51 - who is one of the best players in the world - so knew they would struggle against @entity10			1
‘ i even asked if they were sure about the odds and they said “ yes ” so i staked more money than i would have normally			0
i even got the bookmaker to sign the betting slip			0
‘ i was so excited when the games finished			0
i went to the desk and they confirmed i had won £ 9,000 but said i would have to come back tomorrow to collect my winnings			2

the 39 - year - old backed @entity99 £ 1 each - way at 40 - 1 to win - but an error on his slip gave him @entity104 's odds of 1000 - 1			1
@entity16 gave him £ 66 as a goodwill offer			1
and in september 2008 , @entity106 from @entity107 was given 325 - 1 on @entity108 scoring first and @entity109 beating @entity110 3 - 1 in a football match			1

@entity16 apologised and said the error was made by a new staff member			2
however , one mistake had a happy outcome			0

‘ i was so happy and went out celebrating with friends			0
i gave away £ 200 to them because i was picking up £ 9,000 the next day and wanted to share the wealth			0
‘ i was planning to get a car for myself and fix up my home			0
it is a lot of money to me and i ca n’t just let it go down the drain			0
’ he added : ‘ the silly thing is i would have made more than they are now offering me if i ’d stayed with how i was originally going to bet before being offered these odds			0
‘ what i really ca n’t understand is that i ca n’t go to them when i lose and say i had made a mistake - but they can do it to me			0
’ a @entity16 spokesman said : ‘ the bets were written as three or more goals , however the @entity16 member of staff has incorrectly applied the odds for four or more goals			1
‘ this is auditable and transparent as these markets are publicised on odds comparison websites and in newspapers so there is no dispute over this			0
‘ however , we sympathise with the customer and as the error was made by the member of staff we have offered to settle the bet at the very best prices available anywhere on the high street on the correct market requested			0
