by @entity0 published : 14:22 est , 28 october 2013 updated : 17:19 est , 28 october 2013 somewhere inside the @entity1 sits a notoriously tight - lipped man whose words @entity1 top brass take as gospel and whose mysterious office exists to predict the future			1
@entity8 , 92 , is nicknamed @entity9 both for his bald head and uncanny ability to foresee advancements in military technology and warfare strategy decades in advance and has done so for the @entity16 since @entity17 gave his the agency ’s top job back in 1973			1
and though @entity8 has accurately predicted the fall of the @entity21 , the rise of @entity23 , and the advent of drone warfare , and is credited with helping end the @entity26 , the ‘ @entity1 ’s futurist - in - chief ’ could see his entire office axed if some bureaucrats get their way			1
mysterious , he is : @entity8 , 92 , ( left ) is known as @entity9 ( right ) to @entity1 top brass because of his bald head and uncanny ability to predict what the state of warfare will be 20 to 30 years in the future for the last twenty years , @entity9 has been using the force to contemplate scenarios of an @entity39 war with @entity23 , a nation whose military spending could outpace our own within 20 years			1
as for predictions , he 's said that performance enhancing drugs will one day very soon be just as important as technological developments			0
' people who are connected with neural pharmacology tell me that new classes of drugs will be available relatively shortly , certainly within the decade , ' @entity8 told @entity52 in an extremely rare interview from 2003			2
@entity8 has given very few interviews over the years and very rarely allows himself to be quoted in the press			2
' one of the people i talk to jokes that a future intelligence problem is going to be knowing what drugs the other guys are on , ' he said			0
he 's proven his predictive prowess with the fall of the @entity21 , which he helped catalyze , and managed to keep his office afloat through every presidency since @entity17 's			1
but on october 15 , @entity66 reported that secretary of defense @entity67 and his department were considering getting rid of the internal think tank in light of serious budget cuts			2
@entity8 is so revered in the tight , smoke - filled circles in which he ’s traveled for 40 years , however , that critical voices have chosen to remain nameless			2
@entity74 : here , @entity8 receives the 2008 @entity75 from president @entity76			2
since 1973 , @entity8 has navigated the highest and most secretive circles of the @entity39 military thanks to his remarkable abilities nixonian : this photo was taken in 1973 , the same year president @entity17 gave @entity8 the reigns to the @entity1 's newly formed @entity16 , an in - house think tank formed to predict the state of warfare 20 - 30 years in the future and its mysteriousness is working against it			1
‘ you ca n’t quite tell what the nation is getting out of it , ’ a former senior defense official who spoke on the condition of anonymity told the @entity97			0
that ’s because reports out of @entity8 ’s office — which cover everything from potential nuclear strike outcomes , to energy use in @entity104 , to @entity39 military superiority and any number of warfare and security topics — are so classified that the only person who can read many of them in the @entity1 is the secretary of defense himself			1
even officials speaking on the record are n’t saying much on the subject			0
‘ the @entity1 is currently assessing our missions , structure and programs in light of an evolving set of strategic challenges , as well as a constrained fiscal environment , ’ lieutenant colonel @entity114 , a @entity1 spokesman , told the @entity97 in a statement			0
‘ it would be premature to comment on pre-decisional issues			0
’ regardless of his office ’s usefulness as a whole , no one seems to deny @entity8 ’s personal gifts as a gazer into the politico - military world of tomorrow			1
‘ mr. @entity8 ’s brain is highly networked , ’ @entity131 , @entity132 professor who has known @entity8 for decades , told the @entity97 while praising his ‘ mental suppleness			0
’ his age , @entity135 said , is n’t an issue , either : ‘ his mind is as sharp as ever			0
he ’s gotten not just a second wind but a third wind in recent years			0
’ uncertain future : @entity67 and the @entity1 have considered giving @entity8 and his office the axe due to budget cuts , but a high powered group of @entity147 insider quickly rallied around their ' futurist - in - chief ' also among his fans is @entity23 ’s general @entity150 , who last week said in an interview with the economist : ‘ we studied @entity153 exhaustively			1
our great hero was @entity155 in the @entity1			0
we translated every word he wrote			0
’ @entity153 stands for revolution in military affairs , a theory favored by @entity8 that basically states that warfare technology develops in short and intermittent but transformative spurts — think bows and arrows to cannons to atomic bomb			1
while some say he ’s exaggerated such a possibility in order to keep his obscure office funded , other say this sort of thing is exactly why @entity39 needs @entity8			2
one lawmaker pushing to keep the office around is representative @entity174 , a @entity176 @entity175			0
‘ given the critical contributions to @entity39 national security made by the office during its forty - year history and its role as a central repository for long - range strategic thinking , we believe it would be a serious error to further consider its abolition			0
’ said @entity174 , who is chairman of the @entity190 seapower subcommittee			0
a bigger name fighting for @entity8 himself is a man who worked closely with the @entity16 during his own tenure at the @entity1			1
‘ @entity196 of strategy & transformation @entity197 for 40yr , to cut @entity155 & @entity16 would be a serious mistake , ’ tweeted former secretary of defense @entity195 october 19			1
allies : among the 92 - year - old warfare genius 's strident supporters is former secretary of defense @entity195 , who said ousting @entity8 ' would be a serious mistake '			1

@entity8 has led the @entity1 's mysterious @entity16 since 1973
buried somewhere deep within the @entity1 , the office 's purpose is to look 20 to 30 years into the military 's future and produce reports about *vulnerabilities* and *opportunities*
only the secretary of defense is privy to the group 's top secret findings , but some bureaucrat say its time to axe the agency
@entity8 is said to have predicted the fall of the @entity21 , the rise of @entity23 , and the advent of drone warfare and is *widely* credited with helping to end the @entity26
