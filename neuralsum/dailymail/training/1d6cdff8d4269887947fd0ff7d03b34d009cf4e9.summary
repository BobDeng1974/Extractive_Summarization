a fifth did n’t necessarily trust the doctor treating them while a third could n’t always understand what they were being told			1
one in ten said there were n’t enough nurses and one in five was not always treated with dignity			0
one in four patients said doctors talk over them as if they are n't there , according to a new @entity17 survey the results of the @entity17 ’s annual survey of hospital patients showed care had improved compared to last year			1
but campaigners were still disappointed in the findings , considering the efforts made to drive up standards			1
more than 64,500 patients who had spent at least one night in hospital took part in the survey , which covered various aspects of their care			1
the results show that 24 per cent felt doctors sometimes talked over them as if they did n’t exist			2
twenty per cent did n’t always have trust and confidence in them and 33 per cent did n’t always understand the answers to their questions			0
another 13 per cent of patients thought hospital food was poor while 21 per cent said they were n’t always offered enough choice of meals			0
almost one in ten was put in a mixed - sex ward when they were first admitted and 14 per cent were made to share bathrooms or toilets with the opposite sex			0
one in five was not always treated with respect and dignity and 5 per cent had a poor overall experience of care			0
although the survey found patient care had improved overall , campaigners said the survey findings were still disappointing @entity60 , director of charity @entity61 , said : ‘ whilst it is encouraging that there have been small improvements on in - patient relationships with nurses and doctors and that most patients felt they were treated with dignity and respect , it is deeply disappointing that there has been no significant improvement since 2011			1
do you understand what your doctor tells you ? ‘ @entity74 needs to be a priority for all those responsible for delivering care and should be a fundamental staple in every care setting			2
‘ patients need to be involved more , asked what they think of the quality of care and if there is a problem then people must know how to complain			2
‘ to have an @entity17 that is truly patient - centred and committed to providing dignified care , there needs to be a real change in the caring relationship			1
’ but @entity91 , chief nursing officer for @entity92 , the new body in charge of hospitals and gp services , said the findings were broadly positive			0
‘ the @entity17 must get it right every time for every patient			2
this survey is , on the whole , encouraging and demonstrates progress in key areas			0
‘ however , there remains too much variation in the quality of care provided and hospitals need to look closely at what they need to do to improve			0
