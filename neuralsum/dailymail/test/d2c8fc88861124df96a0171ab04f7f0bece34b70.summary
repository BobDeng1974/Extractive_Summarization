a @entity1 lawmaker has proposed the idea of connecting two cities on the @entity4 with a military tribute bridge made of retired @entity7 aircraft carriers			1
representative @entity8 wants to use two or three carriers to link @entity10 and @entity11 across the @entity12			1
a proposal put forth by @entity8 which would use money from the state 's highway budget to fund a feasibility study about the bridge passed in the @entity19 on thursday			1
the idea is intriguing because the @entity7 is storing three retired carriers just a few hundred yards from the proposed site of the bridge			0
this 2012 shot of the @entity4 shipyard shows two potential bridge parts , the @entity27 and the @entity28			1
there are currently three retired carriers parked at the shipyard - ( left the right ) the @entity27 , the @entity28 and the @entity32			1
the @entity33 ( farthest right ) has recently been towed to @entity35 to be cut into salvage state representative @entity37 wants to use two or three carriers as a bridge across @entity12			1
three carriers are stacked end - to - end in the graphic and the four mothballed carriers can be seen to the right a @entity7 spokesman said the @entity27 and the @entity28 are not ' currently available			2
' they are in the @entity7 's ' reserve fleet ' and could potentially be brought back into service if need arises @entity8 wants to either use three carriers connected end - to - end or two connected carriers with ramps on either side , @entity47 reported			2
state representative @entity8 has attempted to secure $ 90,000 to study the aircraft carrier bridge he said : ' i know that people from around the world would come to drive across the deck of an aircraft carrier bridge , number one			1
' number two , it 's the right thing to do from my standpoint because this is giving a testimony and a legacy memorial to our greatest generation			0
' the two carriers @entity8 was thinking would work for the project are housed in the @entity69			2
the distance across the inlet is less than seven tenths of a mile - 3,700 feet			0
the @entity73 are both 1,070 feet long			0
the @entity74 , which is also at the nearby @entity7 base , is 1,080 feet long			0
unfortunately , a @entity7 spokesman said the @entity27 and the @entity28 are not ' currently available '			2
@entity8 's spokesman @entity78 said the bridge would relieve pressure in the ' bottleneck area ' , @entity77 reported			0
he said : ' this would definitely be a unique way to tackle some of those problems , but at the same time it would serve as a floating memorial to veterans and the sacrifice they have given to our country			0
' it 's a novel concept			0
' i think there 's a lot of public support at least for exploring the idea			0
' @entity8 's spokesman @entity78 said : ' i think there 's a lot of public support at least for exploring the idea ' the $ 90,000 feasibility study has a deadline of december 1 for submission back to the state legislature			1
according to the test of the budget proposal : ' $ 90,000 of the motor vehicle account â€” state appropriation is for a study of the feasibility of constructing a military tribute bridge that spans @entity12 and that incorporates one or more decommissioned aircraft carriers			1
' as a part of this study , the joint transportation committee must : ( i ) determine the cost and process associated with the state 's acquisition of a decommissioned aircraft carrier ; and ( ii ) identify potential engineering options for incorporating decommissioned aircraft carriers into a bridge			2
a report on the study must be submitted to the transportation committees of the legislature by december 1 , 2015			0

the bridge would link @entity10 and @entity11 across the @entity12
@entity1 representative @entity8 is behind the unique idea
state highway budget about project passed @entity19 thursday
study of idea will have a $ 90,000 budget if approved by @entity139
project would involve three carriers or just two and two ramps
rep. @entity8 has eye on the @entity27 and the @entity28
