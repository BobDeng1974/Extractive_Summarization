speaking to @entity1 , @entity7 said : ' in 2005 as my mum was dying of lung cancer , i was diagnosed with a rare liver condition which made me very ill for four years			2
i was in work only on and off , and finally had to have a life - saving liver transplant in 2009			2
' as i recovered from that i realised that i 'd been so lucky to have a second chance and i knew i wanted to make a difference			0
' i decided to do an assembly on homophobic language and why some people are gay			2
that was the moment where i said " as some of you already know , i 'm due to be civil partnered to my boyfriend later this year			0
i want to talk to you about what a @entity51 is , how legislation has changed , and about the words we use to talk about @entity57 issues ' @entity7 began working at @entity8 in 2003 and says that he received a positive , if quiet , reaction to his assembly			1
' a couple of teachers and students told me how much they 'd enjoy it and appreciated me ' being brave '			0
most students had no reaction at all , or maybe occasionally asked about how my partner was			0
there was no negative reaction at all from anyone , including parents			0
' this low - key response at the time has meant the vast national interest in the letter has come as a total shock to @entity7			1
former pupil @entity13 ( left ) told @entity76 5 live he sent the letter because @entity7 ( right ) should get the recognition he deserves @entity7 says : ' i 'm blown away by the reaction			1
people have been so , so supportive and lovely			0
i 'm humbled by the lovely messages and slightly shaken at the way it has gone viral - this is the sort of thing that happens to other people			0
' the last 48 hours have been some of the strangest of my life , with so much radio , tv and newspaper interviews			0
i 'm looking forward to getting back to normality , to be honest , to work on my charity with my amazing colleagues			0
' the touching and simply worded email , which @entity13 told @entity76 he sent because " @entity7 should get the recognition he deserves " , says : ‘ i just wanted you to know how inspirational your assembly was , and how much of a positive impact it had on the school			1
' ' i am a heterosexual man myself but have always been proactive in the fight against homophobia			0
‘ i know this message may seem a little pointless but i really felt you should know that you challenged the ignorance of so many people that day , and if every gay teacher shared your courage , then the world would be a much better place - not just for gay men – but for all of us			1
for that , i thank you			0
@entity116 where @entity7 worked when he gave an assembly about homosexuality and announced that he himself was gay ‘ they may not quite have had the wherewithal to tell you so , but so many of the students had so much respect for you for what you did - never had we witnessed a teacher perform so honestly the act for which they were employed - the act of teaching			1
‘ i will carry the memory with me for the rest of my life			0
’ commenting on the unprecedented national response to this moving story @entity136 , from the @entity137 told the @entity1 : ' @entity7 ’s experience shows us the courage it can take to come out in the workplace and also the importance of positive role models for young people			1
' it is wonderful to hear that all these years later , one of his pupils still remembers the positive effect @entity7 ’s honesty had on them			2
' we hope this sends out a message of support to all those people who are worried about coming out , whether they are a young person or an adult			0
' @entity7 ’s story demonstrates how important it is to live in a society where we can discuss things such as sexual orientation openly without fear or prejudice , but also how important it is for young people to have positive support and guidance			2
