for the first time physicists have ' peered ' into the heart of the sun and detected neutrinos created in the fusion process at its core			1
the researchers spotted the neutrino 's using an ultra-sensitive instrument in @entity10 's @entity9			2
and the results could reveal new information about the lives of neutrinos as they complete a journey lasting thousands of years from the sun 's core to @entity18			1
an international team of physicists from the @entity21 has detect neutrinos created in the sun 's core ( illustrated ) for the first time			1
neutrinos are created in a fusion process in the sun 's core that is ultimately responsible for 99 per cent of its power the research was carried out using the @entity32 instrument in @entity10 , one of the most sensitive neutrino detectors on the planet , which is buried 0.87 miles ( 1.4km ) underground			1
the @entity32 instrument , located deep beneath @entity10 's @entity9 , detects neutrinos as they interact with the electrons of an ultra-pure organic liquid scintillator at the center of a large sphere surrounded by 1,000 tons of water			2
its great depth and many onion - like protective layers maintain the core as the most radiation - free medium on the planet			0
it is the only detector on @entity18 capable of observing the entire spectrum of solar neutrino simultaneously			0
neutrinos come in three types , or ' flavours			0
' those from the sun 's core are of the ' electron ' flavour , and as they travel away from their birthplace , they oscillate or change between two other flavors , ' muon ' to ' tau			2
' one of the crucial challenges in using @entity32 is the need to control and precisely quantify all background radiation			0
to do this @entity32 's centre is filled with a benzene - like liquid derived from ' really , really old , millions - of - years - old petroleum , ' says dr @entity74 , among the oldest they could find on @entity18			2
the international team of physicists from the @entity21 reported their findings in the current issue of @entity80			0
they said that for the first time they have directly detected neutrinos created by the ' keystone ' proton - proton ( @entity87 ) fusion process going on at the sun 's core			1
the @entity87 reaction is the first step of a reaction sequence responsible for about 99 per cent of the sun 's power , dr @entity74 of the @entity21 explained			1
solar neutrinos are produced in nuclear processes and radioactive decays of different elements during fusion reactions at the sun 's core			1
these particles stream out of the star at nearly the speed of light , with as many as 420 billion hitting every square inch of the @entity18 's surface per second			1
they pass through matter virtually unaffected , which makes them very difficult to detect and distinguish from trace nuclear decays of ordinary materials			0
but now using the @entity32 instrument they have been spotted , and it could reveal useful information on the journey they take to get to @entity18 , and also their behaviour , after further study			2
the @entity32 detector contains nylon vessels ( shown ) to make ultra-fine detections			0
a benzene - like transparent liquid produces flashes of light when neutrinos ( and other ionising radiation ) interact with its electrons and nuclei , which allowed this particular detection of solar neutrinos to be made ' with these latest neutrino data , we are directly looking at the originator of the sun 's biggest energy producing process , or chain of reactions , going on in its extremely hot , dense core , ' said dr @entity74			1
' while the light we see from the sun in our daily life reaches us in about eight minutes , it takes tens of thousands of years for energy radiating from the sun 's centre to be emitted as light			0
' he added : ' by comparing the two different types of solar energy radiated , as neutrinos and as surface light , we obtain experimental information about the sun 's thermodynamic equilibrium over about a 100,000 - year timescale			2
' if the eyes are the mirror of the soul , with these neutrinos , we are looking not just at its face , but directly into its core			0
' we have glimpsed the sun 's soul			0
' this inside view show the @entity32 stainless steel sphere , prior to the installation of the nylon vessels in 2004			0
every square inch on @entity18 is hit by about 420 billion solar neutrinos every second but they are very hard to detect without equipment like this			1

physicists from the @entity21 have detected neutrinos created in the sun 's core for the first time
they carried out the research using the @entity32 instrument in @entity10
neutrinos are created in a fusion process in the sun 's core that is ultimately responsible for 99 per cent of its power
every square inch on @entity18 is hit by about 420 billion solar neutrinos every second - but they are very hard to detect
the results help to prove that our theories of the fusion process taking place at the sun 's core are *correct*
