the latest milk crazes have been those such as coconut or maybe even almond milk , but one other new alternative is taking the country by storm and offering significant health benefits , although you will have to fork out a little bit more			1
camel milk is the oldest milk that human beings have been utilising across the globe but here in @entity14 it 's a relatively whole new idea			1
a @entity17 dairy has just received @entity19 accreditation to sell pasteurised camel milk , referred to as ' white gold ' to the public from their farm on the @entity25 , one of just two in @entity14 , the other being in @entity14			1
' we just currently got a processor to process the milk , ' she said			2
' i 've been selling milk for about eight years but i took the science approach ( for camel milk ) because we enjoy doing it and it offers great benefits to the public			1
' camel milk is : * higher in vitamin c ( x5 of cow milk ) * higher in iron ( x10 ) potassium , magnesium * higher in calcium * higher ratio of omega 3 to omega 6 * contains no @entity62 ( allergy senstive - lower in lactose ) * @entity65 cholestrol ms @entity32 embarked on a two year research project to look at selling camel milk in @entity14 and started studying it 's many benefits and why it 's so healthy			1
' there 's been enormous amounts of research on it , 40 years worth			0
6,000 years they 've ( camels ) been domesticated and it 's been ignored here because it 's primarily in @entity80 and the @entity81 , ' she said			0
the difficulty in milking camels in @entity14 is that they 're not used to it , the animals have been predominantly wild for the last 100 years			0
' training camels to milk is no mean feat , you have to train them because there 's no history of milking and they have to trust you			2
' camels have been domesticated for 6,000 years primarily in @entity80 and the @entity81 camel milk has significant health benefits for children with autism , those with diabetes and intestinal problems , as well as allergies ' not every camel are suitable for milking , it depends on the animal and personality , some animals can be difficult			1
' ms @entity32 says there is a lot of hard work involved in milking camels because you have to make sure they are looked after or they wo n't produce			0
' you 've got to spend time looking after the babies as well as the mothers			0
' all those factors , including training for staff and even for vets into the new industry , contribute to extremely high production costs which will see those buying it , have to fork out $ 25 , just for a litre			1
and you wo n't get much milk out of each camel per day , with the average at about 5 litres or 10 if you 're lucky			2
' that price is common around the world , ' said ms @entity32 , ' even @entity134 where the labor is cheaper , they ca n't produce it for under $ 15 a litre			2
' ' in the states it goes fro anywhere up to $ 40 a litre			2
' chair of the @entity145 , ms @entity32 says while these animals have been regarded as feral pests in @entity14 , they are really quite useful to farming operations			0
' @entity150 farmers use them and co graze them with cattle , wonderful to increase cattle wage , help manage land , they eat weeds			0
' and while one would n't think the demand for camel milk is very high , in fact there 's a waiting list for this special type of milk because it 's been proven scientifically to have numerous benefits for a number of conditions			1
' there 's proven scientific evidence that it can be utilised for children with autism , there 's absolutely dramatic results , ' she said			1
camel milk has also been proven to have significant changes in controlling diabetes and for intestinal problems			1
' there 's no comparison to normal milk			2
' the @entity145 states that camel milk is capable of healing and it has been proven by nomadic cultures in the @entity81 and @entity80 who use camel milk exclusively camel milk is higher in @entity186 than cows milk , it 's also higher in calcium , lower in lactose and cholestrol the @entity145 states that camel milk is capable of healing and it has been proven by nomadic cultures in the @entity81 and @entity80 who use camel milk exclusively			1
it is said to also heal food allergies as well as seasonal allergies because the antibodies that camel milk contains are highly anti viral and anti bacterial			1
the association says it 's been found to heal @entity199 and adhd or other learning challenges that can often be directly related back to gut issues			0
but one of the most important things of all when producing a new product for people to consume is undoubtedly the taste and apparently there 's not a lot of difference to your usual cow milk , just a little bit saltier			1
' ( comes down to ) what we feed our animals , healthy animals produce a better product , desert animals more watery milk , our milk is creamy , pure pure white , low in fat , no heavy feeling when you drink it , much easier to digest , more compatible with the digestive system , ' said ms @entity32			2
' i think it will become popular with people who are health conscious , just half a cup to a cup a day is all you need and it really makes a difference			0
' while @entity33 has only just over 30 camels on its dairy farm now , those numbers are growing with a lot of their animals now pregnant			0
the dairy are trying to build up their herd because they do n't start milking the mothers until a baby is two months old			0
a walking encyclopaedia when it comes to the camel industry , ms @entity32 says she loves the industry because camels are such a lovely animal			0
' we have names for all our camels , every one looks different , and i can tell them all apart			0
' as for whether she has a favourite ! ' of course ( hahahaha ) a couple melt your heart , they 're good to walk up to , very gentle , beautiful , highly intelligent , working with them is the easiest			0
