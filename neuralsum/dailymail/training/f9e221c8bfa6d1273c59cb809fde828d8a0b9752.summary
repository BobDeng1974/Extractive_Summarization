zeppelins were once considered the future of air transport - but after the horror of the @entity5 disaster , they disappeared from the skies for more than 75 years			2
now a pioneering aviation firm hopes to bring back the airships in a bid to revolutionise the global market in transporting freight			2
the @entity12 is built using innovative technology which allows it to control its flight better than previous airships , so it should avoid the problems experienced by the first generation of zeppelins			1
the aircraft has been designed thanks to a $ 3million grant from the @entity44 government , and it will soon be ready for its first test flight , according to @entity46			2
the @entity12 is designed by @entity47 , who predict that it will change the way that goods are moved around the world by providing a mode of transport which is cheaper than planes but faster than ships			1
the key technological breakthrough came when the firm 's founder @entity57 came up with a way to compress helium , which allows the airship to control its weight			0
impressive : the new age of the zeppelin relies on technology which compresses helium to allow better control of the aircraft pilots : similar to a conventional aeroplane , the @entity12 has a pilot and a co-pilot sitting in the cockpit lift - off ! the appeal of the new - style blimp comes from the fact that it costs just a third as much to fly as an aeroplane watch more videos about the @entity12 here the @entity12 can take off and land vertically , like a helicopter , so it can visit destinations which do not have an airport			1
this means that even though its 115mph average speed is much slower than a jet aeroplane at 500mph - plus , the overall travel time could be lower because it can travel directly from where goods are produced to where they are needed			0
@entity47 hope that this will make it useful to the military and aid charities operating in parts of the world with poorly developed infrastructure on the ground			0
market : the firm behind the airship insists that it will be perfect for any company involved in transporting goods testing : the manufacturers will be hoping to avoid the safety problems which plagued early generations of zeppelins it may seem flimsy compared to a metal jet , but the @entity12 has bulletproof skin , and even if its exterior is breached it does not deflate like a balloon			1
the firm claims that its first airships will be available to customers in mid- 2015 , when they will be rented out for a year at a time			0
a model of the zeppelin which carries 66 tonnes will cost more than $ 25million per year , while a 250 - tonne version will be $ 55million .			0

the @entity12 can take off and land without an airstrip meaning it can operate even in war zones and disaster areas
