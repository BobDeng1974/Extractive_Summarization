pope @entity0 has called for abolition of life imprisonment calling it a ' hidden ' death sentence			1
@entity0 denounced what he called a ' penal populism ' that offers revenge for victims instead of pursuing true justice			1
he told representatives from the @entity11 : ' it is impossible to imagine that states today can not make use of another means than capital punishment to defend peoples ' lives from an unjust aggressor			1
' pope @entity0 has called for abolition of life imprisonment calling it a ' hidden ' death sentence during talks with the @entity11 , the pope said even those only under suspicion of crimes were being punished and that pretrial detention was being used unlawfully @entity0 said the media and politicians advocated ' violence and revenge , public and private , not only against those responsible for crimes , but also against those under suspicion , justified or not '			1
catholic teaching does not proscribe capital punishment , the pope said			1
according to the @entity38 , ' the traditional teaching of the church does not exclude recourse to the death penalty , if this is the only possible way of effectively defending human lives against the unjust aggressor '			2
but modern advances mean that cases in which execution is an absolute necessity ' are very rare , if not practically non-existent , ' he insisted			0
the pope , who lived for many years under the repressive junta regime in @entity49 , which was responsible for the forced disappearance and murder of thousands of civilians , said that there was a misconception in today 's world that all social problems can be cured through punishment , ' as if different diseases could all be cured by the same medicine '			2
he said that @entity60 must also oppose life long incarceration as a ' a hidden death penalty '			0
the @entity64 recently eliminated life imprisonment from its own penal code			0
he said that cases in which execution is an absolute necessity ' are very rare , if not practically non-existent ' ' all @entity60 and men of good faith are therefore called upon today to fight , not only for the abolition of the death penalty â€“ whether it is legal or illegal and in all its forms ... and this , for me , is linked to life sentences			0
a sentence of life ( without parole ) is a hidden death penalty			0
' it remains to be seen whether the pope 's words have any effect in the @entity87 where 60 per cent say they are in favour of the death penalty			0
one third of @entity87 were raised catholic but half of foreign born residents of @entity87 are of @entity94 backgrounds			0
@entity0 also condemned the process of extraordinary rendition , used by the @entity97 since the september 11th attacks			1
he said some states used ' extra-judicial executions ' as an unintended consequence of an action			2
@entity0 also warned against the use of pretrial detention			1
he said it is being used improperly as another form of unlawful punishment that is ' hidden behind legality '			1
he said : ' in the world today , torture is used not only as a means to achieve a particular purpose , such as a confession or an accusation - practices that are characteristic of a doctrine of national security - but also adds to the evil of detention			2
' he continued : ' criminal code itself bears responsibility for having allowed , in certain cases , the legitimacy of torture under certain conditions , opening the way for further abuse			0

@entity0 said it was ' impossible to imagine ' states could *n't* find *alternatives*
and that the media and politicians advocated ' violence and revenge '
even against those only under suspicion of committing a crime
he said pretrial detention was being used as an unlawful punishment
