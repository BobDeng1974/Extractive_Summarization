@entity0 was seen moving into his new very private and roomy hilltop property nestled deep within the hills of @entity3 on thursday			1
and on tuesday the inside of the $ 3.5m mansion was revealed			1
the home , his second since leaving @entity9 , has modern touches and sweeping views of the @entity12 as well as a luxurious pool			1
the light grey 3,500 square - foot home is far from modest and sits on 11 acres of land ( as reported by @entity33 )			1
built in 2010 , the concrete - and - glass structure came with four bedrooms , 3.5 baths , and 360 - degree views of the surrounding hills			2
views : in addition to 360 - degree vistas overlooking the surrounding hills , the house 's veranda and pool have unobstructed views of the ocean the swimming pool and spa attached to the house also offer an unobstructed sightline to the ocean			2
a built - in grilling station and an outdoor fireplace are features out by the pool , located on a slightly raised wrap - around porch			0
back inside , the kitchen has a centre island fitted with white countertops and cabinets , as well as stainless steel fixtures			0
@entity61 features : a large kitchen features white countertops and cabinets , as well as stainless steel features open plan : with no division between the living room ( right ) and dining room ( left ) , glass walls give the house an open and airy feel the main part of the mansion features an open - plan design , with a step - down living room with a fireplace and a dining room next to it			2
hardwood floors and ornate glass doors mark the entryway			0
even the master bath features mountain views from the bathtub - with no near neighbours this is still private - and a glass - walled shower			2
a bathroom with a view : even the luxury bathroom allows for spectacular views from the tub outside areas : the house is surrounded by covered patios and verandas outside , covered patios surround the building that has a three - car garage attached			2
while the existing photos show the house before @entity0 moved in , the @entity100 reality star was spotted moving in several items , including a king - sized mattress and a bed frame			1
@entity0 's son , @entity107 , was on - hand to help - he took off his shirt to move bar stools from a white pickup truck into the flashy residence			0
wider view : the e ! star 's new spread is surrounded by 11 acres of land move - in day : while more furniture and belongings undoubtedly came separated , @entity0 and his son , @entity107 , were spotted moving in a few items three - car garage : a fan of cars and other motorized toys , @entity0 will likely fill his new three - car garage though it is large , the property is much less ornate that the @entity128 style home he shared with @entity9 , 59 , in @entity129 until 2013			1
the @entity3 residence also appears to be brand new with an untouched roof and what appears to be fresh landscaping around the home			1
@entity0 may have chosen to move now as he has been under the microscope lately			0
casual for the new place : the @entity138 star wore a blue striped golf shirt while @entity107 went shirtless not only has he been strongly hinting that he wants to transition into a female ( thanks to longer hair , painted nails and what appears to be a more curvy body sometimes covered by @entity142 ) , but he was also the center of a fatal accident on @entity145 on february 7			0
the father of model daughters @entity152 , 19 , and @entity153 , 17 , was driving a dark blue @entity154 at the time and dragging a dune buggy when he hit 69 - year - old widow @entity157 of nearby @entity158			0
she was in a white @entity160 and pushed into oncoming traffic where a black @entity162 smash into her , causing her to die			0
several others were involved in the accident as well and were taken to the hospital			0
go daddy ! : @entity107 watched as @entity0 went back into the home where he will no doubt be filming his new @entity100 reality series good deal : surrounding houses have been priced as high as $ 10m , making @entity0 's new digs a steal his old pad : the property is much less ornate that the @entity128 style home he shared with @entity9 , 59 , in @entity129			1

the mansion has four bedrooms and is 3,500 sq feet with three garages
the *secluded* property sits on 11 acres and has views of the @entity12
this is the second home for the @entity100 star , *65* , since split from @entity9
