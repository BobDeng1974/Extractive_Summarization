@entity0 will become the world ’s most expensive teenager when his £ 31.5million move to @entity4 is confirmed			1
others who have worn the tag include the @entity8 @entity7 ( twice ) , former @entity10 boss @entity9 and current holder @entity11 , a soon - to - be team - mate of @entity0			1
boy wonders : @entity0 will top the list of most expensive teenagers when he signs for @entity4 all smiles : @entity0 's £ 31.5m move to @entity4 will make him the world 's most expensive teenager video @entity0 signs for @entity4 be warned , though , for every @entity7 there is a @entity23			1
remember him ? @entity23 , then 19 , signed for @entity24 from @entity25 for £ 6.6m in 1995 but made just six @entity27 appearances for the @entity24			0
here , @entity28 takes a look at the 10 most expensive teenagers in history and determines whether they were a hit , a miss or a maybe			0
june , 1980 : @entity34 ( 19 ) @entity35 to @entity36 - £ 1.25m june , 1983 : @entity9 ( 18 ) @entity37 to @entity38 - £ 1.3m july , 1991 : @entity40 ( 19 ) @entity39 to @entity38 - £ 4.4m july , 1994 : @entity7 ( 17 ) @entity41 to @entity42 - £ 4.8m july , 1995 : @entity23 ( 19 ) @entity25 to @entity24 - £ 6.6m july , 1996 : @entity7 ( 19 ) @entity42 to @entity43 - £ 13m january , 2001 : @entity44 ( 19 ) @entity45 to @entity46 - £ 18m august , 2004 : @entity11 ( 18 ) @entity47 to @entity4 - £ 25.6m 10 ) june , 2006 : @entity48 ( 19 ) @entity49 to @entity50 - £ 16m maybe – still splits opinion at @entity53 given the hype amid the prolonged struggle to prise him from the grasp of @entity4			1
what you can not argue with is his return of four @entity62 , a @entity64 and @entity65 title			0
9 ) may , 2006 : @entity67 ( 18 ) @entity66 to @entity68 - £ 16.5m hit – he enjoyed five goal - laden years with @entity68 – bulging the net on 101 occasions – and fired them to @entity76 glory in 1010 before a handsome profit was returned on his £ 38m move to @entity79			2
8 ) august , 2007 : @entity80 ( 17 ) @entity81 to @entity24 - £ 17m miss – the @entity8 ’s initial promise ultimately faded and , having returned double figures in three consecutive seasons between 2009 and 2011 , injuries perhaps mitigated his decline and he signed for @entity88 in january of last year for £ 12m			0
blue order : @entity48 signed for @entity50 for £ 16m in 2006 unveiling : @entity67 and @entity68 president @entity90 during his official presentation at the @entity92 guard of honour : @entity80 is escored by @entity96 police ahead of his move to @entity98 7 ) august , 2011 : @entity99 ( 18 ) @entity100 to @entity50 - £ 17m maybe – @entity103 and @entity47 fans would argue otherwise , but from a @entity50 perspective @entity99 is yet to prove his worth and it remains to be seen whether he will ever get the chance to do so			2
new boy : @entity109 was just 18 when he signed for @entity50 , then under the charge of @entity111 6 ) june , 2001 : @entity44 ( 19 ) @entity45 to @entity46 - £ 18m miss – five tumultuous seasons – defined by fallouts with every coach , including @entity115 – were brought to a close when he signed for @entity118 for just £ 4m in 2006			0
his talent was never in doubt , but as for his temperament … trouble ahead : @entity44 was the world 's most expensive teenager at £ 18m when he signed for @entity46 in 2001 5 ) may , 2007 : @entity125 ( 19 ) @entity124 to @entity4 - £ 18m miss – perhaps the most resounding failure to reside on this list is the @entity8 midfielder , who has drifted to near obscurity at @entity130 and ended last season on loan at @entity133			1
flop : sir @entity134 expected more of @entity125 when he joined for £ 18m in 2007 4 ) july , 2005 : @entity135 ( 19 ) @entity136 to @entity118 - £ 21m hit – much was made of his mega-money move to the @entity140 but @entity135 has been worth every cent			2
he has now made more than 400 appearances for @entity118 and scored the all - important equaliser in the @entity65 final victory over city rivals @entity68 in may			0
thumbs up : @entity135 has proved a success at @entity118 3 ) july , 2013 : @entity147 ( 19 ) @entity46 to @entity148 - £ 23.5m maybe – still just 20 years old , the @entity8 centre - back enjoyed an impressive first season in @entity152 and has broken into the @entity154 senior side			0
one for the future : @entity148 centre - back enjoyed an impressive first season in @entity158 2 ) july , 2001 : @entity159 ( 19 ) @entity160 to @entity43 - £ 24m miss – that two of his six seasons at the @entity164 were spent on loan elsewhere serves to highlight his struggle – this despite early promise – and he left for @entity118 on a free transfer having scored just 49 @entity171 goals			2
not so handy : @entity159 's @entity43 career eventually faded to disappointment 1 ) august , 2004 : @entity11 ( 18 ) @entity47 to @entity4 - £ 25.6m hit – a debut hat - trick against @entity176 set the tone for @entity11 ’s early years at @entity130 and he has since returned double figures in each of his 10 seasons			1
he perhaps peaked with 34 goals in 2012 but he remains a key player and will be hoping the arrival of @entity184 can spark a revival in his fortunes			0
gr - eight : @entity11 became the world 's most expensive teenager following his £ 25.6m move to @entity130			1

@entity0 's move to @entity130 from @entity192 will break the world *record* transfer for a teenager
@entity11 's £ 25.6m deal in 2004 remains the biggest *fee* paid
