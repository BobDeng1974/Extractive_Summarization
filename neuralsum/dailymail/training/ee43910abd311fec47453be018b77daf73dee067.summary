by @entity0 last updated at 9:31 am on 16th december 2011 the computer hacker who betrayed alleged @entity2 whistleblower @entity1 - who faces a lifetime in prison without parole - said he ' thinks about him every day '			1
@entity7 , 30 , has been dubbed the ' world 's most hated hacker ' after he passed information about @entity1 - who today appears in court charged with illegally transferring @entity13 state secrets to the website - to @entity13 military intelligence			1
he also said it would be to his ' lasting regret ' if the man he described as an ' idealistic young man who could change the world for the better ' was sent to prison for a long period			0
controversial : @entity7 ( left ) was labelled a ' snitch ' for telling the @entity13 military what @entity1 ( right ) was allegedly up to he said : ' i think about him every day			1
the decision was not one i decided to make , but was thrust upon me			0
' but , despite supporters of 23 - year - old @entity1 fears that the soldier could be locked up for the rest of his life , he still insisted he had done the right thing			1
he added : ' had i done nothing , i would always have been left wondering whether the hundreds of thousands of documents that had been leaked to unknown third parties would end up costing lives , either directly or indirectly			0
' @entity7 made his comments last night , hours before the start of a pre-trial hearing in the prosecution of @entity1 in @entity43 , @entity44			1
it is alleged that @entity1 , a soldier , contacted @entity7 on @entity47 instant messaging on may 21 , 2010 , using the name @entity49			1
he knew of @entity7 because of his celebrity status in the hacking world			1
he had been prosecuted in 2003 for breaking into the @entity53 network , and put on six months ' house arrest			0
information : @entity2 was set up in 2007 by journalist and computer programmer @entity57 so whistleblowers , journalists and activists could publish sensitive materials without fear of being identified during the internet chat , it is alleged that @entity1 asked : ' if you had free reign [ sic ] over classified networks for long periods of time , things that belonged in the public domain , what would you do ? ' it is then claimed he told @entity7 he had been downloading @entity13 state secrets on to a cd , on which he had written @entity75			1
@entity2 was set up in 2007 by journalist and computer programmer @entity57 ( pictured )			0
mr @entity57 said he wanted to allow whistleblowers , journalists and activists to publish sensitive materials without fear of being identified			0
his parents met at a demonstration against the @entity82			0
as a teenager , his mother rode into city hall on a horse to protest against the closing of pony trails			0
mr @entity57 has refused repeated requests by the @entity13 intelligence agencies to meet them on ' neutral territory ' to discuss his sources			1
his website 's complex setup is designed to ensure that information sent to it is anonymised before it is passed to the web servers			0
its servers are spread all over the world and do not keep logs , so governments and other organisations can not trace where the information is being sent and received from			0
even so , @entity2 encourages donors of sensitive material to post the material to them on cds , over encrypted internet connections or from net cafes			0
they say this is so that even if @entity2 were infiltrated by a government intelligence agency , submitters could not be traced			0
@entity57 burst into the public consciousness in april 2010 when @entity2 released collateral murder - video footage of a @entity13 air crew shooting @entity118 civilians in 2007			1
but @entity57 recently revealed that the site is at risk of closure and is suspending its publishing operations to concentrate on fighting a financial blockade and raising new funds			0
the stricken website is running on cash reserves after an ' arbitrary and unlawful financial blockade ' was imposed by @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 and @entity132 last december , said @entity57			0
@entity7 passed the details of the conversation to the @entity13 military and , on may 26 , @entity1 was arrested while on duty at the @entity137 outside @entity138			1
he had been working there as an intelligence officer			0
@entity7 was labelled a ' snitch ' by hackers , but remained unrepentant			1
he said : ' i 'm not a politician running for re-election			0
i do n't need to be popular among the hacker community , and i most likely will never be liked in the hacker community			2
' he said he thought long and hard about what to do but in the end believed @entity1 's wellbeing was not as important as the security of @entity13 armed forces			1
@entity1 is set to make his first public appearance today at the opening of his pre-trial hearing			1
the secretive military base is , ironically , home to @entity159 , the organisation whose mission includes protecting computer networks like the one @entity1 allegedly breached by illegally downloading huge numbers of classified documents in @entity118			1
he is suspected of giving them to @entity2 , the anti-secrecy website that last year began publishing the materials			2
the hearing is expected to last through the weekend and possibly beyond			2
it is intended to yield a recommendation to @entity172 major general @entity171 , commander of the @entity173 , on whether @entity1 should be court - martialed			1
@entity171 could choose other courses , including applying an administrative punishment or dismissing some or all of the 22 counts against @entity1			2
if his case goes to trial and he is convicted , @entity1 could face life in prison			2
the government has said it would not seek the death penalty			0
secretary of state @entity184 yesterday called @entity1 's alleged actions damaging and unfortunate in remarks to reporters at the @entity188			1
she said : ' i think that in an age where so much information is flying through cyberspace , we all have to be aware of the fact that some information which is sensitive , which does affect the security of individuals and relationships , deserves to be protected and we will continue to take necessary steps to do so			0
' the @entity1 case has led to a debate over the broader issue of whether the government 's system for classifying and shielding information has grown so unwieldy that it is increasingly vulnerable to intrusions			2
the @entity207 's @entity208 wrote in a recent report that the case points up a central problem with government secrets : ' there simply are too many of them			2
' detained : the military prison at @entity216 in @entity217 where @entity2 whistleblower suspect @entity1 was being held it added : ' as long as over-classification remains rampant , there will be those who see no harm in leaking classified information and / or who believe they are performing a public service by doing so - and the nation will continue to face the risk that such leaks will include secrets genuinely worth keeping			1
' absent from the @entity234 proceedings will be @entity57 , who runs @entity2 from @entity235			0
he is fighting in @entity237 courts to block a @entity239 request that he be extradited to face trial over rape allegations			0
a @entity13 grand jury is weighing up whether to indict @entity57 on espionage charges , and @entity2 is straining under an @entity13 financial embargo that @entity57 says has starved it of revenue			1
friends : @entity1 ( right ) with @entity248 the materials @entity1 is accused of leaking include hundreds of thousands of sensitive items : @entity118 and @entity253 war logs , @entity188 cables and a classified military video of a 2007 @entity13 helicopter attack in @entity118 that killed 11 men , including a @entity259 news photographer and his driver			1
at the time , @entity1 , a native of @entity261 , @entity262 , was a low - level intelligence analyst in @entity138			1
@entity1 , who turns 24 tomorrow , was detained in @entity118 in may 2010 and moved to a @entity264 brig at @entity265 , @entity266 , in july			2
nine months later the @entity172 sent him to the military prison at @entity216 , @entity217 , after a series of claims by @entity1 of unlawful pretrial punishment			1
when it filed formal charges against @entity1 in march 2011 , the @entity172 accused him of using unauthorized software on government computers to extract classified information , illegally download it and transmit the data for public release by what the @entity172 termed ' the enemy '			1
the first large publication of the documents by @entity2 in july 2010 , some 77,000 military records on the war in @entity253 , made global headlines			2
but the material provided only limited revelations , including unreported incidents of @entity253 civilian killings as well as covert operations against @entity290 figures			0
in october 2010 , @entity2 published a batch of nearly 400,000 documents that dated from early 2004 to jan 2010			0
they were written mostly by low - ranking officers in the field cataloguing thousands of battles with insurgents and roadside bomb attacks , plus equipment failures and shootings by civilian contractors			2
the documents did not alter the basic outlines of how the war was fought			0
a month later , @entity2 released hundreds of thousands of @entity188 documents that revealed a hidden world of backstage international diplomacy			0
they divulged candid comments from world leaders and detailed occasional @entity13 pressure tactics aimed at hot spots in @entity253 , @entity312 and @entity313 .			2
