by @entity0 published : 22:21 est , 27 july 2013 updated : 09:55 est , 28 july 2013 when 97 - year - old @entity2 began to lose his eyesight ten years ago he thought he would never be able to paint again			1
but , with the help of a computer and the @entity8 , the legally blind @entity5 grandfather has found a way to express his creativity and make his retirement more enjoyable			1
the former ' lettering man ' who created typography for @entity14 , and who is due to celebrate his 98th birthday on sunday , now creates landscapes reminiscent of @entity18 or @entity19 , which sell for $ 98			0
' it was a hard prospect for the war veteran to come to terms with			0
he had made a career out of his creativity , from being a graphic artist to drafting weather maps when he served in the @entity43			2
he suffers from wet macular degeneration , which made it impossible for him to continue with his traditional method of oils and acrylics			0
in 1999 however , his family gave him a computer , in the hope that it would help him to magnify his work and see colors more easily			2
his grandson , @entity54 , who has made a film about his art , said : ' i knew i had to show him @entity27 , and once i did he just took off with it			0
' intricate : the paintings , of landscapes and animals , are slowly created pixel by pixel sense of fun : after years of working as a graphic designer , the 97 - year - old says he can now enjoy creating images for himself rather than a client creative outlet : @entity2 's family say they had no idea how important @entity27 would become to him after they showed him how to use it ' it was nâ€™t until years later that we realized how important this thing was to him			1
' mr @entity2 told @entity31 : ' i was having a problem with the paint brush because my eye sight was getting poorer			1
i went to the computer because i could magnify it			0
i learned to use the paint program just like i paint with a brush			2
' from village scenes and autumnal forests to stained glass windows , the pictures mr @entity2 now creates in his home studio are both beautiful and intricate			1
the process can be time consuming but mr @entity2 , who has had his work exhibited in @entity5 , said : ' if it takes me two years i can spend that , i 've got a lot of patience			1
' family ties : @entity2 with his son , @entity29 , in 1949			1
he now lives with him in @entity30 patience : it can take @entity2 a long time to create his pictures but he enjoys every moment in the short film about his art , mr @entity2 added : ' it 's no longer work , it 's fun			1
when i worked i always had to do something to please the client			0
now i can do whatever i want			0
' as well as enabling mr @entity2 to continue with his art , his son believes it has helped occupy him after the death of his wife a few years ago			1
holding back his emotions , he said : ' i 've never heard him complain about his age or ... or talk about dying at all			0
he does n't have that in him			0
' the pixel artist is certainly still going strong			0
as part of his 98th birthday celebrations this weekend , eight prints , all signed by the artist , are being sold for $ 98 on @entity126 with 10 per cent of the the money going to the @entity129 program .			2
