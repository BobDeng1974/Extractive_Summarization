by @entity0 published : 15:58 est , 13 january 2014 updated : 17:55 est , 13 january 2014 tragic : @entity2 died in extreme heat during a school expedition to @entity5 in july 2012 a teenager who collapsed in extreme heat during a school expedition to @entity5 died as a result of misadventure , a coroner has ruled			1
@entity11 , 17 , fell to the ground in front of classmates on a five - day trek in temperatures of @entity17 ( @entity18 ) in july 2012			1
the 6ft 2in teenager was taken to hospital by minibus , where he was sadly pronounced dead			1
now , south @entity23 coroner @entity22 has criticised the trek leaders - claiming they were ' inexperienced ' and ' lacking in local knowledge '			1
recording a verdict of death by misadventure , she said : ' the cause of @entity11 ’s death was contributed to by his obesity and lack of fitness and acclimatisation			2
' these risk factors and his tiredness and obvious difficulty in keeping up with the trek were not fully recognised by the leaders , who were inexperienced and lacking in local knowledge			1
' @entity11 , who weighed 20 stone , collapsed at around 3.30pm on july 17 , 2012 , while trekking in @entity44 , in the foothills of the @entity47 mountains , the inquest in @entity49 , south east @entity23 , heard			1
he ' quickly became unconscious ' , yet it took more than an hour for an emergency vehicle to arrive - and when it did , it was a minibus , rather than a fully equipped ambulance			0
when @entity11 eventually reached a medical centre , he was pronounced dead			1
' @entity11 was carried to the road where it was noted that his breathing had ceased , ' said mrs @entity22			2
' cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( @entity59 ) was performed by the leaders and @entity11 was placed in the aisle of the minibus			2
scene : the 17 - year - old collapsed in front of classmates on a five - day trek in @entity44 ( pictured ) at the foot of the @entity47 mountains , an inquest heard			1
he was taken to hospital , where he was sadly pronounced dead ' by this time it was probable that @entity11 ’s life could not have been saved even with advanced medical treatment			1
' she added : ' plans for evacuation relied almost entirely upon local agents to find and obtain appropriate facilities			0
' they were appointed without their qualifications being checked or references obtained , and were not given any formal training			0
devastating : before the trip , @entity11 had been prescribed the drug @entity86 for bed - wetting ' there were no arrangements in place for an ambulance with medical equipment and / or personnel to be provided in an emergency , and the facilities at local medical centres had not been assessed			2
' eleven pupils from @entity99 in south east @entity23 went on the trip , and had raised funds to support the expedition , the inquest heard			2
the itinerary was to include a few days helping to build a school			0
the students had been due to work on a rural project for seven days after the trek , but the trip was cut short after @entity11 died			2
at the time of his death , temperatures in the region were reported to have risen as high as @entity18			0
before the expedition , @entity11 's parents had been given ' inadequate and misleading ' information about the level of fitness required on the trip , as wells as the risks involved , said mrs @entity22			1
' @entity11 was not adequately assessed as to his physical ability to participate , ' she said			0
the teenager had also been prescribed the drug @entity86 for bed - wetting , which he had taken with him to @entity5			0
recording the verdict , mrs @entity22 said the cause of @entity11 ’s death was either exertional heatstroke and / or hyponatremia - a condition where salt levels are reduced in the blood , caused by excessive intake and / or retention of water			1
she said the teenager , who lived in @entity136 , south east @entity23 , may have taken @entity86 in the ' recent past ' , which can cause or contribute to hyponatremia			0
high temperatures : recording a verdict of misadventure , south @entity23 coroner @entity22 said the cause of @entity11 's death in @entity5 ( pictured ) was either exertional heatstroke and / or hyponatremia however , she added it was not possible to determine whether he did so - and if so , whether it contributed to his death			1
speaking after the inquest , @entity11 's parents criticised the company , @entity149 , which organised the trip			1
@entity151 said he would never have allowed his son to go on the expedition if he had known about the arrangements for emergency care			0
' if we had known that in an emergency there would have been no helicopter , no ambulance , no medic - in fact , the best emergency response available was a mini-bus with no medical assistance - we would never have allowed @entity2 to go , he said			0
' in fact i do n’t think there is any school in the country that would go			0
' in a statement after the inquest , @entity171 , managing director of @entity149 , said : ' @entity11 ’s death was an absolute tragedy and our deepest sympathies remain with his family and friends			1
' @entity149 ’s highest priority is the safety of its participants and as the coroner noted , we have introduced a number of new measures since @entity11 ’s death , especially in terms of monitoring participant fitness			2
' we will take time to reflect on the coroner ’s findings and give serious consideration to any change or development where we feel appropriate which will improve safety further			0
he added : ' we have worked hard over the last 26 years to develop an excellent reputation for our approach to safety and how we operate			0
' our policies and procedures reflect industry good practice and comply with the @entity200 ( bs 8848 ) and @entity201 ( @entity202 )			0
