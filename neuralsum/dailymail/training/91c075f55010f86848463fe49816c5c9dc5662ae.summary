the birth of a baby boy from a womb transplant could bring an end to the woes of women unable to have children naturally , doctors have said			1
the world 's first successful womb transplant saw the birth of the child in @entity12 , @entity13 , last month after years of tireless research			1
his birth was only revealed by doctors yesterday as both he and his 36 - year - old mother are in good health			1
and with @entity21 experts planning to carry out the procedure as early as next summer , a leading gynecologist has said the revolutionary surgery could become as popular as surrogacy among infertile women			1
the mother and the baby boy pictured just after his birth			1
he was born weighing 4lbs after his mother received a womb transplant mr @entity31 , of the @entity21 @entity32 , celebrated the birth of a little boy in @entity12 last night , congratulating the doctors who performed the pioneering operation nine months ago			1
and the gynaecologist , who works at the @entity40 , @entity37 's & @entity38 , said the surgery could become a possibility for @entity21 women as soon as next summer			1
' we 're almost ready to go , we are applying for ethics committee approval in the next few weeks at a national level , ' he told @entity48 's today programme			0
mr @entity31 said the medical breakthrough in @entity13 could bring about a new era of childbearing for women with fertility problems			1
' the great big unknown always was could a transplanted uterus carry a baby and have a successful live birth and that 's why what 's happened here is so exciting			1
' the great unknown is now answered which is that it is possible - it 's the proof of purpose			2
' the doctor added the procedure could become as popular as surrogacy , which ' carries as many risks if not more '			0
' it would reduce the demand for surrogacy however there are still plenty of women who will prefer to go down that route and avoid major surgery			1
' but there are many , many women who would prefer to carry a baby themselves			2
there 's also a bit of a legal minefield around surrogacy , and to avoid all of that and to have their own baby is incredible important ( for some women )			1
' unlike the @entity13 ' project , his team would harvest the wombs of cadaveric donors - patients whose hearts are still beating but they are brain dead			1
doctors in @entity12 used the wombs of six women for the transplants			1
' some of our research shows you can retrieve the uterus at the back end of the queue after all the vital organs , so that would be the source of those organs for women in the @entity21			2
' we hope , subject to funding , to get going next year - next summer			1
' speaking of the ' breathtaking ' birth of the baby in @entity13 , one doctor said that it was so emotional , it was like having her own child			2
the boy , who is in perfect health , was born to a 36 - year - old woman who had been born without a womb			1
she carried her baby in the womb of a 61 - year - old woman			1
last night , the @entity119 medical journal released details about the remarkable birth			0
the little boy , whose arrival has remained secret until now , was born by caesarean section a month ago			2
project leader professor @entity125 , of @entity126 , said : ‘ the baby screamed right away and has not required any other care than normal clinical observation at the neonatal unit			0
‘ the mother and child are both doing well and have returned home			0
the new parents are of course very happy and thankful			0
’ @entity136 , a surgeon at @entity126 , who was present at the boy ’s birth , said : ‘ it was breathtaking			0
it was like having your own child			0
@entity125 and his team performing a womb transplant on a woman earlier this year			1
another six women given new wombs are also said to be pregnant the team behind the womb transplants who are , from left - surgeons @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity125 , @entity154 and @entity136 ' it was the same feeling – no one could really believe it			1
’ professor @entity125 said : ‘ there was fantastic happiness among me and the whole team			0
' but at the same time , the sensation was also a little unreal because we really could n’t believe we had reached this moment			0
’ the baby is breastfeeding and growing well			0
his mother may decide to keep the new womb until she has a second child			0
unlike other transplant organs , donor wombs are unlikely to remain in their recipients indefinitely			1
the baby was born two months early after his mother developed pre-eclampsia – a life - threatening condition			2
he weighed just under 4lb and although this may seem small , it is normal for a baby so premature			0
it is n’t known why the woman ’s pregnancy became complicated			0
it may have been due to the strong drugs she was given to stop her rejecting the new womb			0
or due to her underlying health problems ; she only has one kidney			0
another six women who took part in the groundbreaking project at @entity126 are pregnant – and their doctor says their chances of giving birth are good			2
the boy ’s mother , who has not been named , was one of nine women to be given a new uterus			2
in five cases , the donor was the woman 's mother – meaning the same womb could carry two generations of the same family			2
in this instance , the new womb came from an unrelated woman , a mother of two , who was long past the menopause			0
professor @entity125 , who has spent more than a decade perfecting the complex gynaecological techniques needed , said : ‘ it gives us scientific evidence that the concept of uterus transplantation can be used to treat uterine factor infertility , which has remained the last untreatable form of female infertility			0
’ a woman ’s own eggs are used in the procedure meaning the baby will be genetically her own			0
critics of the procedure include fertility expert @entity226 , who says the risks are too great and some women should accept they ca n’t bear children			0
the world ’s first womb transplant was in @entity232 in 2000 but the woman ’s body rejected the organ after four months			2

@entity240 's first successful womb transplant was completed in @entity13
baby boy born to 36 - year - old women in @entity12 after transplant
another six women have fallen pregnant after receiving donor wombs
breakthrough could reduce demand for surrogacy in the @entity21 , experts say
first @entity21 transplant may be carried out as soon as next summer
will allow infertile women *option* to carry their own babies unlike surrogacy
