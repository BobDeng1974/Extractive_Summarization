@entity0 of @entity1 was all smiles as she met the families of brave men and women killed in @entity6 following a commemoration service at @entity8 today			1
@entity9 , who is eight months pregnant , also provoked a smile or two from those around her , when she appeared to grimace as her unborn child kicked her as she made her way out of the cathedral			1
the 33 - year - old was accompanied by the @entity17 and other senior members of the @entity19 for the ceremony at @entity8 in @entity21 , which was also attended by veterans and family members of the soldiers who died			1
by this point , @entity9 has totally mastered the art of looking put - together and ladylike ( as if she had any other choice ! )			0
there 's a reason why her outfits are endlessly replicated everywhere			0
of course , being royalty has something to do with it , but apart from that , @entity9 has majorly enviable style so its understandable why so many people want to get a piece of it to call their own			0
as every pregnant woman knows , it 's next to impossible to look chic and structured as your belly comes in , but @entity9 pulls it off with ease ! @entity0 of @entity1 's coat is amazingly still available over at @entity34 for close to one grand			2
but as we all know , once word gets out about where to buy this jacket , it 's sure to sell out super fast , so buy it while you still can ! if you do n't have the budget of a to - be - princess , one of our picks in the edit below should fit the bill ! @entity74 at @entity75 visit site which we want @entity78 at @entity79 visit site the @entity81 at @entity82 visit site @entity84 at @entity75 visit site tribute : @entity0 , 33 , was at @entity8 's with husband @entity87 for a service commemorating the men who died in @entity6 windy : she also had some trouble with her hat , thanks to the chilly march breeze that sprang up as she made her way outside , the @entity0 went over to speak to the families and exchanged smiles with some of the brave fighters before joining the crowds outside for a flypast			1
she also spent some time chatting to a glamorously dressed @entity100 , with the two apparently enjoying a friendly , if rather animated , conversation			2
earlier , @entity9 had appeared moved as she sat beside husband @entity87 and his brother @entity102 to hear the tributes paid to the 453 men and women who died while serving in @entity6			1
the service was held to mark the end of combat operations in @entity6 after 13 years , with the final @entity110 battalions pulled out and sent home last autumn			2
@entity102 , who served two tours of duty in the country , looked particularly solemn as prime minister @entity115 spoke of the ' outstanding bravery ' of the men and women who fought			2
' we take pride in the scale of their achievements , driving out @entity124 and building up the @entity6 forces so they can begin to take control of their own security , ' he continued light relief : the moment was one of the more light - hearted of a morning that had focused heavily on the sacrifice of @entity110 troops safely down : @entity0 of @entity1 walks down the steps of @entity8 's accompanied by @entity87 and @entity102 contemplation : @entity0 had looked enormously moved as tributes were paid to the men and women who died senior royals : the @entity140 and @entity9 were part of a party of senior royals that also included the @entity17 and prince @entity144 family affair : also at the service were the @entity147 and @entity148 and prince @entity149 , @entity140 @entity150 : @entity0 looked happy and relaxed as she joined fellow royals and veterans for a flypast outside the cathedral paying attention : the @entity140 and @entity9 stand to attention as the planes soar overhead warm : the @entity140 and @entity9 chat to the @entity159 and the @entity100 following the service ' thirteen years on , the terrorist threat to our country from the region has been substantially reduced			1

' but the @entity110 withdrawal came too late for some , among them cpt @entity170 , 30 , warrant officer @entity172 , 38 , and @entity173 , 36 , all of the @entity174 , who were among the last to perish in the conflict			0
the service , which was led by the prime minister and the @entity17 , involved almost every senior member of the royal family , among them the @entity159 and the @entity100			1
also seated in sir @entity183 's magnificent cathedral was @entity184 , @entity184 , @entity148 , @entity148 , and prince andrew , duke of york			0
the princess royal , who looked wonderful in her military uniform and cockade hat , was also at the service and , afterwards , travelled back to @entity190 for the final day of the @entity191			0
during the service , a cross made of shell casings from the memorial at the main allied base in @entity6 , @entity192 was brought through the cathedral by representatives of the three forces and presented at the altar			2
