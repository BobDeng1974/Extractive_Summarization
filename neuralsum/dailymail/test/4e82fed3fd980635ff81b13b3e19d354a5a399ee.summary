which player is the second - highest scorer in the country this season ? stand up and take a bow anyone who came up with @entity6 , who was one of @entity7 ’s own before they loaned him to @entity8 and sold him to @entity9			1
@entity10 is young , electric - paced and on 28 goals this season - one behind man - of - the - moment @entity11 of @entity12 and @entity13			2
@entity15 celebrates after scoring @entity9 second goal in a 2 - 1 win at @entity18 on @entity19 @entity15 doubled @entity9 ' advantage from the penalty spot after he was fouled by @entity18 's @entity22 @entity18 ( 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 ) : @entity23 6.5 ; @entity24 6.5 , @entity25 6 , @entity26 6.5 , @entity27 7 ; @entity28 6 ; @entity29 7 ( @entity30 , 76 ) , @entity31 5.5 , @entity32 5 ( @entity33 , 57 , 6 ) , @entity34 5.5 ( @entity35 , 83 ) ; @entity36 6 subs not used : @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 goal : @entity43 90 +4 booked : @entity28 , @entity26 @entity9 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity44 6.5 ; @entity45 7 , @entity46 7 , @entity47 7.5 , @entity48 7 ; @entity15 7 , @entity49 6.5 , @entity50 6.5 , @entity51 7 ( van @entity52 , 66 , 5 ) ; @entity10 8 ( @entity54 , 83 ) , @entity55 7.5 ( @entity56 , 66 , 5.5 ) subs not used : @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61			1
goals : @entity10 46 , @entity15 72 booked : price ref : @entity64 6 man of the match : @entity10 if he keeps this up , @entity10 might even be able to inspire @entity9 all the way into the @entity70			1
what a bargain for £ 2million , too			2
having scored 19 times for @entity8 , the 22 - year - old striker has nine goals in 15 appearances for @entity77 ’s wanderers			1
he has a goalscoring knack , beautifully illustrated 30 seconds into the second half when he collected the ball round the centre circle and started running			2
back - tracking @entity18 defenders held off and held off until , boom , @entity6 took a pot - shot and @entity23 retrieved the ball which had just avoided his finger tips			1
suddenly a tight , strangely underwhelming , match , had a breakthrough and @entity9 duly capitalised on it as @entity15 doubled the lead from the penalty spot			1
they are building up a head of steam as the @entity94 enters the final weeks with one defeat in nine			2
@entity77 has steered his team from the blind side with remarkable efficiency			2
a trip across to the @entity100 could have been a very tricky encounter considering @entity18 ’s resurgence under @entity103			0
the news that owner @entity105 wants @entity106 to stay beyond the summer hardly comes as a surprise			0
more importantly , from the supporters ’ point of view , the manager is making all the right noises about triggering his year ’s option too			0
the @entity106 effect is tangible at the @entity114 , even if this turned out to be the first real blip			0
@entity22 has been back to something like his best after a forgettable first chunk of the season so this was a step back for him , too			0
if anything illustrates @entity125 and @entity126 – before and after @entity127 – then it is @entity31 ’s match stats			0
before @entity127 ’s sacking @entity22 had 10 yellow cards and five goals to his name			0
since then he has picked up one more booking and scored seven times			2
admittedly he went into this @entity100 derby on the back of a six - match goal drought and it was his clumsy challenge on @entity15 which had referee @entity64 pointing to the spot			1
@entity9 defender @entity45 ( right ) battles for the ball with @entity18 striker @entity36 @entity142 ( left ) tackles @entity36 during their @entity19 encounter at the @entity114 ground @entity28 attempts a scissor kick as @entity18 look to breach the @entity9 defence a bad day at the office , then , for @entity18			1
maths and time is against them making the top six but beating @entity9 would have had the double impact of keeping them in the chasing pack and denting the top - six hopes of @entity77 ’s team			1
certainly the 27,000 bumper good friday crowd who braved the drizzle arrived in hope and expectation because @entity106 ’s other achievement since his arrival has been a transformation of home results			0
five straight victories at the @entity114 after a similar winless run had injected optimism			0
by the final whistle there were resigned expressions on faces again despite a 90th minute consolation from @entity43			1
yet it had started promisingly			0
@entity174 might have scored in the opening minutes although it would have been a fluke			1
the @entity18 attacker blocked @entity44 ’s clearance and the ball ballooned up and could have gone anywhere			0
@entity6 celebrates after putting @entity9 1 - 0 ahead at the @entity114 on @entity19 @entity10 ( centre ) gave the visitors the lead with a right footed shot from outside the box the @entity9 striker ( centre ) is mobbed by his team - mates after putting them ahead in the second half the home side also had their ‘ a ’ man and , like @entity10 there is an @entity7 connection			1
@entity36 was on the wanted list of many clubs in january but @entity18 managed to persuade the @entity194 to loan him out to them			0
he was named from the start but struggled to impose himself			0
his best moment was a penalty claim when he went down under a challenge from @entity29 but @entity64 was having none of it			2
highlights for @entity18 included a long - range effort by @entity24 which was pushed wide by @entity44 while @entity22 shot over the bar from the edge of the area			1
wolves thought they had scored in the first half when @entity25 ’s slip let in @entity209			2
@entity23 saved the shot and @entity27 blocked the follow - up by @entity55			1
next up for the @entity212 is @entity213 at home on @entity215			0
@entity216 was an interested spectator on @entity19 and he needs no telling it will be a toughie .			0

@entity6 fired @entity9 ahead on 46 minutes with a low right - footed shot
@entity15 doubled the visitors lead from the penalty spot on 72 minutes
@entity43 scored a late consolation for the hosts in injury time
win moves @entity9 on to *68* points with six games remaining
