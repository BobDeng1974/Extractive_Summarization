by @entity0 published : 11:06 est , 31 january 2014 @entity2 : 05:14 est , 1 february 2014 it 's a problem that has spoiled exam papers , texts - even articles			2
and now , the elusive apostrophe has struck once more			0
in a blunder that has sparked furious debate across @entity11 , one street features all three variations of the punctuation mark			1
outrage : residents in @entity11 warn the misuse of punctuation on signs could confuse emergency services the signs for @entity21 in @entity11 - named after 17th century landowner sir @entity19 - read @entity19 , @entity23 ’ and @entity23 ’s			1
@entity24 is already facing criticism for abolishing all grammar from signage and some locals have started adding their own apostrophes			0
now , locals are calling for official guidance on the matter			1
marketing expert @entity33 , 33 , who lives on the street with three names , said : ' we should n’t be removing punctuation from road signs			1
' the whole point is that it ’s named after an individual and it ’s part of the character of the area			1
' if you remove it , it takes out that heritage			0
but if the council is going to have a policy , it should apply it correctly			0
' cllr @entity50 , an independent member on @entity24 and a former @entity52 teacher , agreed			0
he said : ' we do n’t want any warts on sir @entity19 ’ name			1
he should be properly remembered			0
' the three signs displaying the name of a street named after landowner sir @entity19 feature three different uses of the apostrophe policy : the council attempted to rule out punctuation from all signs , but these signs have slipped through @entity66 , director of the @entity11 - based @entity67 , said the apostrophe should come after the ‘ s ’ - making @entity23 ’ the correct spelling			1
she said : ' my understanding is that it is named after somebody and so the apostrophe has to come after the 's '			2
' you could add an additional ‘ s ’ after that but it is a matter of preference really			0
' the other two variations of the street name are certainly wrong			2
' the move to ban apostrophes from all signage in the city came in the light of new national guidance which warned punctuation could confuse emergency services			1
council bosses were widely criticised for dropping apostrophes with local government secretary @entity90 wading in to blame the ban on ' overzealous pen - pushers '			0
but despite the confusion a council spokeswoman has claimed there are no plans to remove the incorrect signs			2
she said : ' whilst we agree the correct form of usage is @entity101 , our records show the name has been represented in various forms over the years			1
' having looked at documents produced by others we can also see the same variations appearing over time as well			0
' whilst there may be an inconsistency , we do n’t believe this is causing confusion locally			0
' we are not proposing to replace the signs at this time as this would not be a good use of council taxpayers ’ money			2
