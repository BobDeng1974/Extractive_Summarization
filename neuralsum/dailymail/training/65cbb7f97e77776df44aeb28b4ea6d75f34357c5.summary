the majority of @entity1 do not think president @entity2 has been aggressive enough with the @entity3 , a poll released on wednesday revealed			1
a resounding 74 percent described @entity2 's actions toward @entity6 extremists as ' not tough enough			1
' and another 52 percent said they 'd be in favor of allowing the president to use @entity1 ground troops to take out @entity11 if airstrikes in @entity13 and @entity14 are not enough			1
likely voters went a step further and told pollsters for @entity18 that they 're skeptical the president 's plans to degrade and destroy the terrorist group will work at all without boots on the ground			1
@entity2 has categorically rejected the notion that he could ask @entity1 forces to engage in combat in @entity13 , but 58 percent of likely voters said they do n't see a path to success if he does n't			2
nearly three - fourths of @entity1 think president @entity2 , pictured here today speaking at @entity30 in @entity31 , @entity32 , has not been ' tough enough ' on @entity6 extremists if president @entity2 changed course in @entity13 and sent in @entity1 ground troops , the majority of @entity1 would support him			1
in fact , most likely voters think he 's going to have to if he wants to defeat @entity11 that 's more than double the percentage of likely voters who said bombs alone would send @entity11 packing , 23 percent , and three times the percentage who could n't say one way or the other , 19 percent			0
overall all respondents to @entity18 's survey , which was commissioned by @entity49 polling firm @entity48 and @entity51 firm @entity50 and conducted sunday through tuesday , were unhappy with nearly every single angle of president @entity2 's strategy to combat the terrorist group			2
worse , nearly two - thirds of respondents - 64 percent - said they do n't even think @entity2 has a ' clear strategy ' for taking out the @entity3 , even though the president has repeatedly clarified that he does after inadvertently stating last summer that he did n't			0
@entity2 has since shared his plans with the @entity62 a prime - time address last month , the president said his long - term strategy will rely on airstrikes against militants in @entity13 and @entity14 , military aid to @entity13 and @entity69 forces , a training and weapons program to arm moderate @entity14 rebels and a broad international coalition working together on a number of fronts			0
yet 53 percent of respondents still say @entity2 's doing a bad job handling terrorist threats			2
the same percentage gave him poor marks on @entity13			0
likewise , 54 percent of people polled said it was ' crazy ' for the president to announce to the enemy that he would n't authorize @entity1 ground forces under any circumstances			1
just 34 percent said it was ' smart ' to clue @entity1 in on planned military engagement			0
an alarming 80 percent of @entity1 said they are either very or somewhat concerned that @entity11 is going to attack the @entity1 i n the ' near future , ' despite assurances from the @entity90 and other @entity2 administration officials that they 've found no evidence to support that assessment			1
the only terrorist plot uncovered by the @entity1 in recent months that it 's shared with the public is one being plotted in @entity14 by the unrelated @entity97			0
like @entity11 it is an an off - shoot of @entity99 but the two do not appear to be working together			0
the @entity101 announced late last month that it had preemptively struck the group in @entity14 as a preventative measure .			0
