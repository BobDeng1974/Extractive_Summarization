shown here is a close up of the sun showing a solar prominence on its surface a prominence forms over timescales of about a day , and stable prominences may persist in the corona for several months , looping hundreds of thousands of miles into space			0
the red - glowing looped material is plasma , a hot gas comprised of electrically charged hydrogen and helium			0
the prominence plasma flows along a tangled and twisted structure of magnetic fields generated by the sun ’s internal dynamo			0

the stunning results show huge bursts of flames leaping from the sun 's surface others highlight giant sunspots ( in the centre of this image ) which are often larger in size than @entity2 itself			1
sunspots form from shifting magnetic fields at the sun 's surface , and are actually cooler than their surrounding solar material the red - glowing looped material is plasma , a hot gas comprised of electrically charged hydrogen and helium an erupting prominence occurs when such a structure becomes unstable and bursts outward , releasing the plasma			2

according to @entity70 , the sun is currently in the midst of an active phase of its 11 - year solar weather cycle and is expected to reach peak activity sometime this year			0

it does so by the minute , which makes it a fascinating subject to photograph			0

he then shoots small video clips before stacking and processing the split - second frames in photoshop to build a single clear image			0
mr @entity4 , who has only been photographing the sun for around 14 - months , added : ‘ there are no text books on this subject and i have developed my own methods over time to get a good result			1
‘ all of my equipment is off the shelf amateur astronomy gear			1
it is all within reach of a normal working person			2
’ but despite having all the equipment , there are some things no one can prepare for - the weather			0
mr @entity4 added : ‘ it is not always easy to capture these images as you have to contend with bad sight lines in the daytime due to clouds , wind and rain			0
