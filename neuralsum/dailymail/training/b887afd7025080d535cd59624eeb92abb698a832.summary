being the @entity1 coach can be a very lonely place			1
i can remember times when i just shut the door to my office and had a quiet word with myself			2
thankful of a couple of hours to think , i ’d repeat in my head : ‘ ok , you can do this , keep calm and get the job done			2
’ it ’s an all - consuming job but champions and winners in all areas of life , not just sport , perform at their best when the pressure is at its greatest			2
@entity1 head coach @entity20 ( right ) looks on at his squad as they take part in a team huddle @entity20 looks very composed during games and trusts his coaching team , according to sir @entity26 @entity28 head coach @entity27 looks on during @entity28 training on friday the key to dealing with pressure is to sit down and speak to your team and plan how you are going to react to every scenario			1
you have to prepare and practise ... even how to lose			2
do not underestimate the pressure these two coaches are under			2
both teams are in a corner and the stakes are huge			2
whoever has dealt with that pressure better this week will win on saturday			2
from the outside , @entity1 appear to have handled it well — something that is epitomised in @entity45 ’s consistent selection — and it should carry them home in a must - win match			1
@entity20 and @entity28 ’s @entity27 act very differently during games			1
@entity20 looks very composed , trusting his coaching team , but becoming more animated if the game is not going his way			1
@entity27 shouts into his microphone and clearly lives and breathes every tackle			2
there is no right or wrong , but to make the correct calls you can not get carried away with the emotion of the game			2
@entity1 ’s players will have looked to @entity45 for leadership over the course of this week			1
the loss against @entity64 will be felt more acutely because @entity1 were in a position to win the game and will know they did not perform well in the second half			1
( from left ) @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 run during training @entity1 fly half @entity76 practises his kicking during training at @entity79 on friday the players will have looked to see how @entity45 handles the pressure of that defeat			1
trust me , players want to know how well their coach can handle the intensity of top - level sport			0
@entity20 appears to be admired and respected by his players and coaching team , but it is in weeks like this as a coach that you have the opportunity to show your resolve , your strength and lead from the front			1
handling pressure when you win is one thing , handling it when so much is at stake is another			0
i had a chance to catch up with @entity27 at the @entity104 02 @entity103 tennis this week and he and his team were , as usual , great ambassadors for the game and their country			2
@entity27 was on good form , the squad relaxed and philosophical about their loss in @entity112			2
@entity27 really did seem in control of everything			0
@entity1 are by no means in disarray and there is no need to panic			1
indeed too often coaches and teams over-react to a loss			1
but a reaction is needed after four losses on the bounce , and there really is no better game for it than @entity28 at @entity79			1
@entity20 will have had to take the lead in every session			1
his voice needs to be the loudest and clearest within the set - up			0
it ’s important that a coach has a couple of people outside the squad who you can trust just to offload a bit			0
i would confide in the former @entity1 and @entity140 prop @entity141			1
when i made my debut for @entity1 , @entity141 was one of the senior players and the respect i have for him and his opinion has never wavered			1
@entity28 's stars are put through their paces during the captain 's run on friday @entity150 stretches during the @entity28 session on the @entity79 pitch @entity153 passes the ball during the @entity28 captain 's run at @entity79 he could be brutal at times in his assessments but he gave it to me straight			1
that ’s what i liked and that is what i needed			0
his favourite line after a period of silence was always : ‘ @entity167 — i would n’t have done that ! ’ i hated hearing those words			2
things can start to fall apart if you fail to plan for the bad times and just try to make it up as you go along			0
i hope @entity20 had planned his response to defeat against the @entity64 , it ’s his job to be one or two steps ahead of his own team			1
he also needs to find out exactly who in his squad is prepared to really front up , which players and coaches thrive under this pressure			0
i ’d listen to the media and use any criticism as inspiration and motivation			0
i would create a siege mentality , knowing the best players would channel criticism and up their performance			0
‘ @entity196 ’ is one of my favourite lines from my time as head coach			0
it really came to the fore in matches like this			0
the message was simple : no longer were we going to accept the role of the underdog , valiant performances and the occasional victory against the southern - hemisphere nations			0
our team , like this @entity1 team , was capable of better			1
the @entity211 fans , the media and ourselves all expected victory			0
and @entity1 really can deliver on the expectation on saturday			1
this is the perfect game for them — everyone knows what is coming at them today , nothing flash is needed in defence other than sheer guts and bravery			2
deliver that and @entity1 will win			1
@entity1 players look dejected during the demoralising defeat against @entity64 last saturday @entity64 celebrate after beating @entity1 24 - 21 in an impressive display at @entity79 @entity28 , arguably , have the best and most physical pack in world rugby			1
they will run directly at you with very few offloads from their forwards			0
not only will they try to hurt the tackler , but they are also looking to cause maximum pain at the contact			0
the gainline is everything to them — it ’s in their dna and part of their macho make - up			0
their two powerful centres will look to smash their way across it			0
i was on the receiving end when i played for the @entity140 in 1980 and their philosophy has n’t changed much since			0
you pay for that physicality in collisions unlike in any other match , but @entity28 ’s predictability makes them totally beatable			1
the key is to stretch them			0
you need to get the ball away from the breakdown swiftly and make at least one more pass after the first receiver and offload wherever possible			0
the support play has to be through the roof			0
the back row is crucial here			0
i ’d look for @entity269 and @entity69 to show their handling skills in this regard , keep the ball alive and do not get drawn into their comfort zone			1
space is everything — find it , exploit it , kick into it and the raw speed of @entity282 and @entity72 will be @entity1 ’s greatest asset			1
for @entity1 to win they will have to out - think @entity28 and be more inventive			1
@entity1 no 8 @entity69 puts his hands out ready to receive the ball during training on friday skipper @entity269 led out his side for the captain 's run at @entity79 on friday ahead of the match i want to see new backs moves and for @entity1 to be far more creative with their kicking game			1
i hope to see lots of dummy runners too — because you absolutely know the @entity298 will take the contact			0
they ca n’t help themselves			0
i ’d like to see kickers at 10 and 12 , but in many ways i ’m pleased @entity45 has stuck with @entity304 at inside centre			0
it shows he ’s not being cowed by other people ’s opinions			0
@entity310 needs to get far more involved as an effective second kicker and allow @entity312 to use his quick feet in the wider channels			0
@entity1 must get the ball to their dangerous runners more often , having failed to do so against the @entity64			1
they need to offset the @entity320 defence and target space			0
i want to see a tough , aggressive @entity211 team take the field and i ’d like @entity79 to be more hostile and uncomfortable for the @entity298			1
i ’m concerned that the way the ground is being marketed as ‘ the home of @entity211 rugby ’ makes it too cosy for @entity1 and their opponents alike			1
@entity1 are playing the toughest team in world rugby — a home is a warm welcoming place			1
i would n’t be surprised to see yellow or red cards			0
@entity28 have a history of not handling pressure well when they ’re backed into a corner			1
back in 2002 their entire team lost the plot and we crushed them 53 - 3			0
i do n’t expect the same on saturday , but one or two of their players could cross the line			2
the pressure is on both teams but i feel that @entity1 have handled it slightly better			2
this game will go down to the wire			2
who can handle the pressure in the last few minutes will be key			0
@entity1 want this game more and that should see them home — just .			1

@entity20 has to show his leadership skills after @entity64 defeat
@entity1 face @entity28 at @entity79 on saturday *afternoon*
there is no need to over-react to the loss suffered against @entity64
@entity1 want the game more and that should see them over the line
