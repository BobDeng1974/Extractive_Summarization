millions of genetically modified mosquitoes could be released in the @entity1 if @entity3 researchers win approval to use the bugs against two extremely painful viral diseases			1
never before have insects with modified dna come so close to being set loose in a residential @entity10 neighborhood			1
' this is essentially using a mosquito as a drug to cure disease , ' said @entity15 , executive director of the @entity16 , which is waiting to hear if the @entity17 will allow the experiment			1
this undated photo made available by @entity20 shows a genetically modified @entity22 mosquito in their @entity3 lab. @entity24 is considering releasing the non-biting male @entity22 mosquitoes modified by @entity20 to pass along a birth defect to their progeny , thus killing off the next generation of the mosquitoes that can carry dengue and chikungunya			1
the @entity17 is planning to release the mosquitos in a neighborhood of 444 homes near @entity36 , @entity37 ( @entity38 photo / @entity20 , @entity39 ) @entity20 's lab workers manually remove modified females , aiming to release only males , which feed on nectar and do n't bite for blood like females do			1
the modified males then mate with wild females whose offspring die , reducing the population			2
dengue and chikungunya are growing threats in the @entity10 , but some people are more frightened at the thought of being bitten by a genetically modified organism			1
more than 130,000 signed a @entity57 petition against the experiment			1
even potential boosters say those responsible must do more to show that benefits outweigh the risks			0
' i think the science is fine , they definitely can kill mosquitoes , but the @entity66 issue still sticks as something of a thorny issue for the general public , ' said @entity70 , who studies mosquito control at the @entity1 @entity72			1
' it 's not even so much about the science — you ca n't go ahead with something like this if public opinion is negative			0
' mosquito controllers say they 're running out of options that can kill @entity22 , a tiger - striped invader whose biting females spread these viruses			0
climate change and globalization are spreading tropical diseases farther from the equator , and @entity36 , the southernmost city in the continental @entity10 , is particularly vulnerable			1
' an arriving person would be infectious for several days , and could infect many of the local mosquitoes , ' @entity15 said			2
' within a few weeks you 'd likely end up with several infected mosquitoes for each infected visitor			2
' insecticides are sprayed year - round from helicopters and door - to - door in charming and crowded neighborhoods throughout the @entity96			0
but because @entity98 aegypti do n't travel much and are repeatedly doused with the same chemicals , they have evolved to resist four of the six insecticides used to kill them			0
enter @entity20 , a @entity3 biotech firm launched by @entity104 researchers			1
they patented a method of breeding @entity22 with fragments of proteins from the herpes simplex virus and e. coli bacteria as well as genes from coral and cabbage			0
this synthetic dna has been used in thousands of experiments without harming lab animals , but it is fatal to the bugs , killing mosquito larvae before they can fly or bite			0
@entity20 's lab workers manually remove modified females , aiming to release only males , which feed on nectar and do n't bite for blood like females do			2
@entity127 , a field inspector with the @entity16 , tests a sprayer that could be used in the future to spray pesticides to control mosquitos in @entity36 , @entity37 there are no vaccines or cures for dengue , known as ' break - bone fever , ' or chikungunya , which causes painful contortions			1
@entity10 cases remain rare for now , but dengue sickens 50 million people annually worldwide and kills 2.5 percent of the half - million who get severe cases , according to the @entity143			1
@entity144 has already overwhelmed hospitals and harmed economies across the @entity147 after infecting a million people in the region last year			0
the modified males then mate with wild females whose offspring die , reducing the population			0
@entity20 has built a breeding lab in @entity155 and hopes to release its mosquitoes this spring in @entity158 , a neighborhood of 444 homes closely clustered on a relatively isolated peninsula at the north end of @entity36			1
@entity17 spokeswoman @entity162 said no field tests will be allowed until the agency has ' thoroughly reviewed all the necessary information			1
' @entity168 spokeswoman @entity166 said the test will be similar in size to @entity20 's 2012 experiment in the @entity172 , where 3.3 million modified mosquitoes were released over six months , suppressing 96 percent of the targeted bugs			1
@entity20 says a later test in @entity176 also was successful , and both countries now want larger - scale projects			0
but critics accused @entity20 of failing to obtain informed consent in the @entity172 , saying residents were n't told they could be bitten by a few stray females overlooked in the lab. @entity185 , an entomological technician with the @entity16 , sorts and counts dead captured mosquitoes under a microscope in @entity36 , @entity37 instead , @entity20 said only non-biting males would be released , and that even if humans were somehow bitten , no genetically modified @entity113 would enter their bloodstream			1
neither claim is entirely true , outside observers say			0
' what @entity20 is trying to spin is that it 's highly improbable that there will be negative consequences of this foreign dna entering someone that 's bitten by an @entity20 mosquito , ' said @entity70			0
' i 'm on their side , in that consequences are highly unlikely			0
but to say that there 's no genetically modified dna that might get into a human , that 's kind of a gray matter			0
' asked about these points , @entity166 says @entity20 has now released 70 million of its mosquitoes in several countries and received no reports of human impacts caused by bites or from the synthetic dna , despite regulatory oversight that encourages people to report any problems			2
' we are confident of the safety of our mosquito , as there 's no mechanism for any adverse effect on human health			0
the proteins are non-toxic and non-allergenic , ' she said			0
@entity20 should still do more to show that the synthetic dna causes no harm when transferred into humans by its mosquitoes , said @entity230 , a molecular geneticist at @entity232 's @entity231			2
to build trust in any cutting - edge science , a range of independent experts — not just the company that stands to gain or the regulatory agency involved — should have enough access to data published in peer - reviewed journals to be able to explain the specific benefits and risks , he said			0
' failing to do this almost inevitably means a potential for controversy to be sustained and amplified , ' said @entity230 , adding that mosquito - borne diseases need more solutions			0
' we should not be closing down productive avenues , and genetically modified mosquitoes might be one of them			2
' an aedes aegypti mosquito feeds on the arm of @entity256 , the @entity96 supervisor for the @entity16 , in @entity257 , @entity37 with the @entity17 watching , @entity15 and @entity20 's product development manager , @entity39 , checked their frustration at public meetings in november and december , repeatedly fielding the same questions from the same critics			1
their selling points : this experiment is self - limiting , using insects engineered to kill their progeny , not make them stronger			2
it is contained , since @entity20 's mosquitoes wo n't breed with other species			2
killing off aedes aegypti can protect human health while eliminating an invasive species			0
and most @entity158 residents responded positively to a district survey about the planned field test			1
using gmos also could save money : the district spends 10 percent of its budget on @entity22 , which represents less than 1 percent of the 45 mosquito species buzzing around the @entity96			0
@entity158 resident @entity283 still was n't persuaded			1
the @entity96 have n't experienced a dengue outbreak in years , and no chikungunya cases have been reported here , she said			1
' if i knew that this was a real risk and lives could be saved , that would make sense , ' @entity283 said			0
' but there are no problems			0
why are we trying to fix it ? why are we being used as the experiment , the guinea pigs , just to see what happens ? ' if the @entity17 decides against the test , or the modified mosquitoes fail to work as promised , @entity15 will still need to kill the bugs			1
' i 'm convinced the only way to fight this is using the mosquitoes to fight each other , ' he said			2

researchers waiting to hear if @entity17 will allow the experiment to proceed
