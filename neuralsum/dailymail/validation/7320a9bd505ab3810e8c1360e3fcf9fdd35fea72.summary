eating three meals a day is as much a part of our routine as getting up in the morning and going to sleep in the evening			1
now , experts have warned eating breakfast , lunch and dinner may be damaging our health			2
in fact , there is no evidence eating three square meals a day is beneficial to the body ’s needs for energy , the website @entity10 reports			1
in fact , skipping meals and fasting could actually be better for health than sticking to rigid eating patterns			1
there is no evidence eating three meals a day is healthier than eating in other forms , such as six or nine meals a day historian @entity28 told journalist @entity29 that these meals are cultural constructions @entity32 settlers enforced on @entity34			1
in her new book , ‘ @entity44 ’ , ms @entity28 said the settlers ate meals at regimented times and considered this more ‘ civilised ’ than the natives whose eating patterns varied with the seasons , and included fasting			1
a quirk of history has meant this pattern has been heralded as healthy , when in fact there is no evidence for this assertion , ms @entity28 said			1
for example , breakfast is considered the most important meal of the day largely due to advertising campaigns by cereal and juice companies , she claims			2
in fact , a 2014 study by the @entity59 found whether or not a person ate breakfast had zero effect on the overall calories they consumed in a day			2
those who ate breakfast did burn more calories than those who skipped it , but they burned off the extra calories later in the day , meaning the net calorie consumption was the same			2
new research shows skipping meals and fasting could actually be beneficial for health , triggering weight loss and strengthening the immune system similar @entity78 research found eating breakfast or not made no difference to dieters trying to lose weight			1
and last year , @entity82 reported on research published in the journal @entity85 , which found eating meals within an eight hour window each day could help a person shed weight			2
fasting can be good for your health , experts claim			0
a study found that fasting for two days or more can help to kick - start the immune system , especially if it has been damaged by ageing or cancer treatment			1
it encourages the body to replace old and damaged cells , @entity98 researchers said			0
@entity102 , a longevity expert at the @entity104 , said : ‘ when you starve , the system tries to save energy , and one of the things it can do to save energy is to recycle a lot of the immune cells that are not needed , especially those that may be damaged			0
’ his team found fasting for two to four days every six months forced the body into survival mode , using up stores of fat and sugar and breaking down old cells			0
‘ the body then sent a signal telling stem cells to regenerate and “ rebuild the entire system ”			0
' mice fed a high - fat diet within an eight hour time frame – for example between 9am and 5pm – were both healthier and slimmer than those given the same number of calories throughout the whole day			0
even when obese mice had their eating window reduced to nine hours , they were able to drop five per cent of their body weight within a few days – while still enjoying the same amount of calories			0
whether a person eats three large meals a day or six smaller ones makes no difference to their overall calorie count , a 2010 study published in the @entity141 journal of @entity142 found			0
researchers found no weight or hormonal differences between the two groups			0
last year , a @entity154 study found no difference between women who ate two meals a day and another group that ate five			0
and new research suggests fasting - deemed ' uncivilized ' by the @entity32 settlers - could actually be healthy			2
advocates of the 5:2 diet , which involves limiting food to just 500 calories on two days a week , say denying the body food leads to weight loss , a longer lifespan and lower blood pressure			1
similarly , a @entity104 study published last year found fasting for two to four days every six months forces the body into survival mode , using up stores of fat and sugar and breaking down old cells			0
this caused the body 's entire immune system to regenerate , providing better protection against infection and disease , experts said .			1

@entity28 wrote ' three squares : the invention of the @entity187 '
argues three meals a day was a @entity32 invention from the @entity192
there is ' no evidence ' it is beneficial to eat in this way , over other patterns
studies show it does *n't* matter if you skip breakfast or eat more often
fasting leads to weight loss and a *stronger* immune system , say experts
