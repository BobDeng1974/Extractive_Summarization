by @entity0 published : 04:38 est , 26 october 2012 updated : 19:30 est , 26 october 2012 hoodie ban : @entity2 argued against an order imposed on him which restricts him from wearing a hoodie jumper an armed robber who claimed a hoodie ban would violate his human right to ‘ keep his head dry from @entity10 rain ’ was told by a judge to use a flat cap instead			1
@entity2 insisted that he needed to wear a hoodie because he hoped to work in the building trade when he was released from prison and might need one			1
the astonishing claim was made by his lawyer , @entity18 , after the 41 - year - old and two accomplices were convicted of a plot to rob £ 90,000 from a cash delivery van			2
‘ there are factors such as rain to contend with , ’ she told a judge			2
‘ when one walks down the street one likes to keep one ’s head dry			0
‘ i wonder whether to prevent a person from wearing a top with a hood , being a gentleman in @entity10 , which has a propensity to endure rain , might be to have his human rights interfered with			0
’ but judge @entity37 told @entity2 he should wear a traditional flat cap instead			1
‘ let ’s not be silly about this – you say mr @entity2 is a gentleman , well then , he can use a furled umbrella , ’ he added			0
‘ or what about a flat cap ? ' there was a time 50 years ago when every man was walking around with a flat cap			2
’ justice campaigners last night condemned defence lawyers for playing the ‘ human rights ’ card			0
failed robbery plot : @entity2 was jailed along with his uncle @entity54 ( right ) and @entity55 ( left ) after they were caught by police preparing to rob a £ 90,000 cash delivery from a supermarket in april a spokesman for @entity61 said : ‘ if @entity2 wants to talk about human rights , let ’s talk about the rights of the driver of the security van he was about to rob – surely he has a right to go about his job without fear or injury ? ‘ too often these days defence lawyers are playing the “ human rights card ” and it is a disgrace			1
it is becoming a default setting in solicitors and barristers			0
this latest case is laughable – especially referring to him as a “ gentleman ”			0
‘ i do n’t know what his lawyer was trying to achieve but she failed rather spectacularly			0
’ judge refuses : judge @entity37 thought the argument was ' silly ' and made some suggestions as he refused the plea what to wear : judge @entity87 suggested @entity2 use a furled umbrella or wear a flat cap , an accessory even worn by @entity91 miss @entity18 made the plea after @entity2 was convicted at @entity93 of conspiracy to rob a security van			1
' when one walks down the street , one likes to keep one 's head dry ' @entity2 's lawyer @entity18 earlier this year , @entity2 was jailed with his uncle , @entity54 , 48 , and , @entity55 , 39 , after they were caught planning to rob cash vans following a police surveillance operation			1
they had been plotting to rob a £ 90,000 cash delivery from a @entity107 supermarket on april 19 and were caught armed with a machete and sledgehammers			0
crucially the gang had tried to conceal their faces with ‘ snoods ’ – a type of scarf – when they were caught by police			0
after the sentence , @entity116 applied for a @entity118 , which bans the men from wearing hoods within 50 metres of shops , banks and cash delivery vans , and from travelling in the same vehicle			1
they are even barred from wearing false moustaches and beards or possessing any type of face coverings in public			1
judge @entity87 rejected the arguments of @entity2 and granted the @entity118			1
violent plans : the trio were caught with a bag containing this sledgehammer as they prepared for the robbery longest - serving armed robber : also in the bag was a machete , confiscated by police , as @entity2 prepared for the crime which follows other crimes he committed including a a violent £ 275,000 spree for which he was given a 23 - year sentence for armed robbers ' bag : pictured is the bag confiscated by police from the armed robbers			2
the @entity118 banes them from wearing hoods within 160ft of shops , banks and cash vans @entity2 , of @entity157 , who was also behind an attempted robbery at a post office in 2010 , admitted conspiracy to rob and attempted robbery , and was jailed for nine years			1
@entity54 – who in 1996 became the region ’s longest - serving armed robber when he was jailed for 23 years after a £ 275,000 spree – was jailed for 18 years			0
@entity55 was jailed for 13 years			0
laughed at suggestion : the trio , who appeared via videolink from prison at the hearing in @entity93 ( pictured ) , laughed at the judge 's suggestion of an umbrella or flat cap and said ' keep your flat cap '			2

@entity2 was jailed for a failed robbery plot with two others
as part of sentencing , police applied for a @entity118 which bans them from wearing hoods nears shops , banks and cash vans
@entity2 argued he needed a hoodie for work and to keep the rain off his head following his release
the judge rejected the plea and suggested @entity2 wear a flat cap
the order also restricts the wearing of fake moustaches , beards or any face coverings in public
