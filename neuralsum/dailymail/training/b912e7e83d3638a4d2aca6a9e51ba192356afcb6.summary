by @entity0 a father - of - two is slowly turning into a ‘ living statue ’ after developing the extremely rare @entity3 ( @entity3 )			1
former chef @entity4 , 55 , first fell ill with flu - like symptoms two years ago and despite dozens of tests , x-rays and scans , doctors were baffled			1
but after pain and stiffness spread to his face , arms and legs , he was finally diagnosed with the neurological disorder last month			1
@entity4 , 55 , has @entity3 which means his muscles are becoming progressively stiffer			1
he currently needs crutches to get around and fears he will soon have to use a wheelchair it is thought to affect less than one in a million people			1
from walking with a stick in november 2012 , mr @entity4 moved onto crutches in january this year and he expects to be in a wheelchair by the end of the year			1
there is no known cure for @entity3 , which causes progressively severe muscle stiffness			1
experts believe the disease is caused by abnormal antibodies which cause an autoimmune reaction			1
mr @entity4 now takes 11 different types of pill four times a day and will next month undergo a plasma exchange in a bid to ‘ wash out ’ the problematic antibodies			1
mr @entity4 , of @entity36 , in @entity37 , @entity38 , said : ‘ i ’m very worried about the future because i do n’t know how this disease is going to affect me			1
mr @entity4 thought he had flu when he first developed the condition but within just a few months he required a walking stick			1
he now has to take 11 different medications four times a day mr @entity4 ( pictured in 2008 with his grandson , @entity45 , before his illness ) is no longer able to work and is afraid of falling over and breaking an arm or hitting his head ‘ i used to be very active			1
now if i walk to the shops and back , which is about 200 metres , that ’s me finished for the whole day			0
‘ i ca n’t work			0
i used to be a chef and i ’ve worked in @entity53			0
in both jobs i was always on my feet			0
@entity3 ( @entity3 ) is a rare disease of the nervous syndrome			1
it causes progressively severe muscle stiffness - typically in the spine and lower extremities			1
it often begins very subtly during a period of emotional stress			0
most patients also experience painful muscle spasms that are triggered by stimuli such as a sudden noise or emotional stress			2
there is thought to be an auto - immune component and many patients also have other auto - immune conditions			1
symptoms usually develop in the mid- 40s			0
@entity3 is extremely rare and is thought to occur in fewer than one person per million			1
it is more common in women than in men and is linked to diabetes			0
there is no cure but medications can be taken to relief muscle spasms			2
in extreme cases , the condition can be fatal if it paralyses the respiratory muscles			2
sufferers also often fall over and can suffer severe injuries as a result			0
in most cases , however , symptoms can usually be well managed with medication			0
‘ but i ’m starting to fall over now			0
i get up and my feet and legs feel numb and i ca n’t walk			0
i ’m worried that i ’m going to fall and hit my head			0
‘ i stand up from my chair and i can feel all the muscles tighten in my legs			0
‘ recently i ’ve started dropping things , like cups of tea			2
my left hand goes numb			0
’ mr @entity4 suffers numbness on the left hand side of his face , his left hand and both legs			2
nights are especially painful as he gets ‘ dead legs ’ and excruciating foot and leg cramps			0
he first became ill in july 2012 and thought it was just a flu bug but by november he was walking with a stick			1
walking became increasingly painful for him and this january he was given crutches , but finds them painful to use and is worried that he will fall and break an arm			2
now he is coming to terms with the prospect of being in a wheelchair by the end of the year			1
he said : ‘ there ’s no cure and if the last year or so is anything to go by it ’s only going to get worse			0
‘ i used to be so active			0
i loved running and playing football , but now i am looking at getting around in a wheelchair			0
i try to stay positive but it ’s difficult because @entity3 is so rare and there does n’t seem to be any chance of a cure any time soon			2
’ professor @entity129 , professor of neurology at the @entity131 , said : ‘ @entity3 is a very rare disease			2
it ’s not a condition that neurologists come across very often			0
mr @entity4 suffers numbness on the left hand side of his face , his left hand and both legs			2
nights are especially painful as he gets ' dead legs ' and excruciating foot and leg cramps mr @entity4 ( pictured with his daughter , @entity145 , in 2009 - before his illness ) said : ' there 's no cure and if the last year or so is anything to go by it 's only going to get worse ' ‘ because of its rarity , it can be extremely difficult to diagnose and there can be a considerable delay between the display of symptoms and its diagnosis			1
’ he said @entity3 is caused by the malfunction of neurotransmitters in the spinal cord , which lead to uncontrollable nerve activity , causing muscle spasms			1
professor @entity129 added : ‘ in its most severe form , the symptoms that can occur in @entity3 can be so severe that the individual is completely incapacitated			2
‘ in the most extreme manifestation , the person can go as rigid as a block of wood and that can affect movement and things like breathing and eating			0

@entity4 has the neurological condition @entity3
it started in july 2012 when he developed what he believed to be flu
by november 2012 he needed a walking stick and he now uses crutches
he expects that by the end of the year he will need a wheelchair
the one - in - a - million condition causes progressive muscle stiffness
it is thought to be caused by an autoimmune reaction
