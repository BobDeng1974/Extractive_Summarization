by @entity0 published : 11:15 est , 27 august 2012 updated : 05:57 est , 28 august 2012 an @entity3 immigration officer whose colleagues claimed he looked at the @entity6 website too much at work was sacked over alleged links to @entity10 terrorism , a tribunal heard			1
the 44 - year - old interpreter , who helped special branch interview terror suspects at @entity13 , had his security clearance removed in 2005 , a month after returning from a year - long sabbatical in his native @entity16			1
the tribunal heard how colleagues noticed that he accessed the @entity6 news website ' excessively ' and became suspicious of him			2
a tribunal heard how colleagues noticed that the 44 - year - old accessed the @entity6 news website ( pictured ) ' excessively ' and became suspicious of him he was suspended on full pay for five years then sacked after the @entity25 deemed him a risk to national security			2
now the officer , a naturalised @entity29 citizen , has attacked the @entity25 for not allowing him to defend himself against the unspecified allegations and is suing his former employers for discrimination and unfair dismissal			2
the father of three claims it was only because of his race and the fact that he is a @entity10 that he was suspected of associating with terrorists			1
action : the 44 - year - old man , who can not be named , was suspended and then sacked after he returned from a year 's sabbatical in his native @entity16 , pictured his employment tribunal was covered by controversial ‘ closed material procedures ’ , which allow cases to be heard almost entirely in private to stop sensitive intelligence being discussed in public			2
known only as ‘ mr @entity48 ’ , he has not been told of the evidence against him as the @entity25 argued it would risk national security			1
rebuttal : @entity53 's @entity25 refutes the allegations of discrimination and unfair dismissal the @entity57 has led the criticism of the government ’s proposed ‘ secret justice ’ system , which will let judges approve ministers ’ requests for closed hearings in all civil cases apart from inquests			2
mr @entity68 was told his security clearance was withdrawn from his estimated £ 28,000 - a - year post because he had been ‘ identified as an associate of a network of suspected @entity74 extremists who were assessed to be supporting the insurgency in @entity76 ’			1
the @entity25 added that even an innocent link to such people would put mr @entity48 in a ‘ vulnerable position ’			0
large parts of the hearing at the @entity82 have been held behind closed doors without mr @entity48 , his legal team or the press and public allowed in court			0
instead of his chosen lawyer , he is represented by a special advocate – appointed by the attorney - general – who has clearance to see the secret material but is forbidden from discussing the evidence with mr @entity94 work : the man 's last job was at @entity13 , pictured , as an assistant immigration officer but he then had his security clearance revoked due to the sensitivity of the material , the @entity25 barristers did not ask mr @entity48 anything under cross-examination and the department ’s witnesses said four times during proceedings they could not answer questions put to them in open court			1
mr @entity68 joined the @entity25 in 1999 – the same year he was granted @entity29 citizenship			0
his last role before his suspension was as an assistant immigration officer at @entity13 , in which capacity he could routinely check classified information and occasionally top - secret data			0
mr @entity68 , who was sacked in 2010 after an external appeal found against him , said : ‘ i was not told ... of the identity or identities of the person with whom i am alleged to have associated			1
if i was told of such a person , i would have been able to explain such contact and prove my innocence , if indeed there was such contact			1
‘ whilst in @entity16 i met a number of people but i do not recall anyone who was fanatical or seemed of that type or who i thought was suspicious			0
' none of my family in @entity16 or the @entity29 , immediate or extended , is remotely interested in politics or terrorism			0
i am certain of that			0
‘ while going about my normal business , for example attending a mosque , i suppose i may be statistically more likely to come into contact , without knowing it , with a supporter of the insurgency in @entity76			0
‘ i consider myself loyal to the @entity29 and to the @entity25			0
’ mr @entity68 told the tribunal last week that police had never interviewed him nor had security services asked him to assist any investigations			1
the @entity25 denies discriminating against mr @entity48 ’s race and religion and is contesting his claim of unfair dismissal			1
the tribunal has concluded and reserved judgment until a later date .			0

the @entity156 interpreter helped @entity158 interview terror suspects
claims he was only suspected of associating with terrorists due to his race and @entity10 religion
he has not even been told of the name of the terrorists he was alleged to have associated with
