the global warming ‘ pause ’ has now lasted for almost 17 years and shows no sign of ending – despite the unexplained failure of climate scientists ’ computer models to predict it			1
the @entity7 has also learnt that because 2013 has been relatively cool , it is very likely that by the end of this year , world average temperatures will have crashed below the ‘ 90 per cent probability ’ range projected by the models			1
these also provide the main basis for the sweeping forecasts of a perilous , hotter world in a new report by the @entity19 @entity18 ( @entity18 )			1
the graph above covers the period june 1997 to july 2013			2
it was drawn using the official @entity24 ‘ @entity23 ’ monthly data for world average temperatures , and shows the lack of a warming trend			2
it updates the chart @entity7 published a year ago , which first made the pause headline news and forced the @entity18 to discuss it			1
@entity33 's official source of information on polar ice caps got its figure for a dramatic recovery in 2013 @entity39 sea ice out by a million square kilometres – then quietly corrected its mistake without mentioning it			0
on september 4 , the @entity44 - funded @entity43 and @entity45 ( @entity46 ) , based at the @entity47 , stated on its website that in august 2013 the @entity39 ice cover recovered by a record 2.38 million sq km – 919,000 sq miles – from its 2012 low			2
news of this figure was widely reported – including in this newspaper on september 8			0
but on september 10 , the @entity46 quietly changed it to 1.38 million sq km ( 533,000 sq miles ) – and replaced the original document so the old figure no longer shows up on a main @entity58 search			0
it can now only be found on an old ‘ cached ’ page			0
prompted by an inquiry from ‘ green ’ blogger @entity62 , the @entity46 ’s spokeswoman @entity60 said the mistake was a ‘ typographical error ’ , telling him : ‘ there are no plans to make a statement on the change because it was not an error in the data			0
’ while 2013 remains the sixth lowest @entity39 sea ice year since 1979 , forthcoming research suggests the long - term melting trend is partly cyclical , and may have begun a reversal			1
a footnote in the new report also confirms there has been no statistically significant increase since 1997			1
last night independent climate scientist @entity80 – an accredited @entity18 reviewer and co-author of peer - reviewed papers – pointed out that taking start years of 2001 , 2002 or 2003 would suggest a cooling trend of 0.02 - @entity85 per decade , though this would not be statistically significant			1
at a press conference to launch the report in @entity89 , the @entity18 refused to say how long the pause would have to go on before casting doubt on the models , suggesting trends were only meaningful if they lasted 30 years			1
but some of the report ’s authors are less confident			2
@entity97 , @entity98 ’s professor of @entity99 , told @entity7 : ‘ if it does get beyond 20 years , that would get very interesting			1
' we would have to revisit the models			0
as it goes on , it would get more and more peculiar			0
’ he added : ‘ we are right on the edge of the probability distribution now			0
we have to accept that if we are going to come up with projections , they have to be correct			0
’ even this marks a big change from earlier statements by eminent climate scientists			0
in 2009 , professor @entity114 , head of the @entity115 , said in a leaked ‘ @entity117 ’ email : ‘ bottom line : the no upward trend has to continue for a total of 15 years before we get worried			0
’ however , not only does the report deny the importance of the pause , it makes a firm , short - term forecast that it is about to end – claiming that the period 2016 - 2035 will , on average , be 0.3 - 0.7c hotter than 1986 - 2005			1
that , said prof @entity129 , head of climate science at the @entity131 , is a high - risk strategy : ‘ the @entity18 has thrown down the gauntlet			1
’ should the pause continue , she said , ‘ they are toast ’			2
she was critical about the report ’s statement that confidence humans had caused most of the warming of the @entity141 had increased from 90 per cent in the last @entity18 report in 2007 to 95 per cent			1
‘ how they can justify this is beyond me			0
’ other ‘ lukewarmer ’ experts – scientists who do not ‘ deny ’ the world has warmed , partly in response to humans , but do not expect imminent catastrophe – were equally scathing			0
prof @entity150 , the @entity152 professor of meteorology at the @entity153 , said the @entity18 had ‘ truly sunk to a level of hilarious incoherence			1
they are proclaiming increased confidence in their models as the discrepancies between their models and observations increase			0
’ he added : ‘ it is quite amazing to see the contortions the @entity18 has to go through in order to keep the international climate agenda going			1
’ @entity165 , director of the @entity166 , said that since 1980 , climate models had on average overstated the extent of warming by between 79 and 159 per cent			0
‘ this does not mean that there is not some global warming , but it likely means that temperature rises will be lower than originally expected			1
that fact makes alarmist scenarios ever more implausible			0
’ he added : ‘ the @entity178 will pay $ 250 billion [ £ 166 billion ] for its current climate policies each and every year until the end of the century			2
for almost $ 20 trillion , temperatures will be reduced by a negligible @entity182			0
’ in @entity89 , @entity18 leaders described the models as ‘ more and more remarkable ’ , insisting that the pause has no significance			1
but inquiries by this newspaper have established the report ’s final version , issued on friday after four days and nights of intense negotiation between scientists and government officials from 130 countries , produced a radical shift away from the confidential ‘ final draft ’ of june			2
insistent : @entity18 leaders say their models are increasingly reliable			1
pictured here , chairman @entity199 this had admitted : ‘ models do not generally reproduce the observed reduction in surface warming trend … there is medium confidence that this difference between models and observations is to a substantial degree caused by unpredictable climate variability			0
’ another possible factor was ‘ too strong a response to increasing greenhouse gas ’			0
in the final version , this became : ‘ the long - term climate model simulations show a trend in global - mean surface temperature from 1951 to 2012 that agrees with the observed trend … there are , however , differences between simulated and observed trends over periods as short as ten to 15 years			1
’ the final version also tried to minimise this coded acknowledgement of the pause by saying periods as short as 15 years were ‘ very sensitive to the beginning and end dates ’			2
it said no conclusion should be drawn from the lack of warming since 1998 because this was one of the hottest years on record , while the models were ‘ not expected to reproduce the timing of internal variability ’			0
yet the pause has lasted since january 1997 , not 1998 , and 1997 was not a hot year			1
the world invested almost a billion dollars a day to limit global warming last year , according to a recent study			2

the @entity7 first revealed global temperature pause a year ago
@entity18 report confirms no significant rise in global temperature since 1997
@entity18 *accused* of *sinking* to ' hilarious level of incoherence '
but the @entity18 insists 2016 - 2035 will be 0.3 - 0.7c hotter than 1986 - 2005
