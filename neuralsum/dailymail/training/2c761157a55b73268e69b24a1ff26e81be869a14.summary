by @entity0 published : 20:34 est , 22 march 2013 updated : 20:34 est , 22 march 2013 barely 30 miles separate sir @entity2 ’s £ 10 million mansion in the lush @entity4 countryside from the rundown terrace in a @entity7 suburb where @entity8 eked out his last years			1
but the gulf in the respective fortunes of the film legend and his younger brother , to whom he was once so close , could n’t have been bigger			0
whereas @entity2 has personally overseen , at vast expense , the transformation of his 20 - acre lawns into something rivalling a stately home , weeds grow through concrete slabs in the tiny paved - over front garden , and paint is flaking off the windows of the modest house in @entity25 where @entity8 lived with his wife @entity26			1
@entity2 at home with his brother @entity8 in 1964 - but they had a distant relationship in their later years movie star caine — born @entity2 — did not attend his brother ’s funeral a few weeks ago , after he died , aged 77 , following years of ill health			1
nor was @entity8 ’s passing mentioned on the actor ’s official twitter page , despite him having posted a heartfelt tribute to his friend , film director @entity39 , who died around the same time			1
indeed , news of @entity8 ’s death only emerged last week just as — with poignant irony — his brother was being honoured by the opening of an exhibition at the @entity46 , commemorating his life and work , to coincide with his 80th birthday			1
yet there had been a time when @entity8 , also an actor , had dreamt of emulating his brother ’s stardom , even appearing in several of @entity2 ’s most famous films , including @entity57			1
actor @entity2 talks to his brother @entity8 during a break in filming ' @entity60 ' in @entity7 , during the @entity62 , they were inseparable , crashing out after long nights of partying at the flat in @entity66 ’s trendy @entity65 that they shared with actor @entity68			1
but while @entity2 went on to amass an estimated £ 50 million fortune , @entity8 ’s film career foundered and he made ends meet by working in @entity73 department store in @entity7			1
and despite @entity2 — who lives with second wife @entity75 — owning a second grand home in @entity77 , just a few miles from @entity8 ’s two - bedroom house , the brothers had a distant relationship in the final years of his life			1
@entity8 ’s widow @entity26 , 67 , is understandably devastated by his death			1
‘ the grief is only just hitting me , ’ she told me at their home this week			0
‘ we were together 35 years ; it ’s still very raw			2
’ she says @entity2 stayed away from the funeral to avoid a media circus			2
‘ we did n’t want a big fuss , ’ mrs @entity90 added			0
‘ but @entity2 is grieving for his brother			2
’ in fact , a few years before his death , @entity8 admitted that he had drifted apart from sir @entity2 — a result , he said , of his own battle to stay away from booze			1
‘ @entity2 invites us down a lot but [ @entity26 and @entity101 ] do n’t drink any more			2
we ’d love to sit there and drink the best wines in the world , but we ca n’t , ’ he said in 2007			0
@entity26 added at the time : ‘ we ca n’t be in @entity2 ’s party circuit			1
@entity2 is one of those people who can have [ drink ] or leave it			2
but if you ’re not that way inclined … ’ she said , tailing off			0
‘ the thing is , we were having a drink every day — the older we got , the more it did n’t agree with us			0
’ of course , few would have blamed @entity8 if he had stayed away from his brother , rather than face the stark reality of just how different his life was from the opulent lifestyle @entity2 enjoyed			1
until his death , @entity8 existed on regular small hand - outs from multi-millionaire @entity2			1
in the @entity119 , the £ 95 that the star gave him every week was enough to allow him to give up his job at @entity73 ’ book department and try to launch a career as a writer , which was sadly unsuccessful			2
@entity2 and @entity8 in @entity57			1
while @entity2 's career bloomed , his brother could not emulate his success although the money had increased in recent years , it was still enough only for the couple to avoid claiming welfare benefits			1
yet proud @entity8 also turned down offers from his brother to pay for luxury holidays at the exclusive @entity133 in @entity134			2
it would only have been natural if he felt uncomfortable in the constant shadow of his famous sibling			0
the two boys were brought up in near poverty in a two - room flat in @entity141 , @entity142 , by their father , @entity2 , a porter at @entity146 fish market , and their charlady mother @entity147			2
@entity2 was a gambler and drinker , who regularly frittered away the family ’s rent and gas money at the bookies or the pub. times were tough , and malnutrition led to the young @entity2 — originally named @entity2 after his father — being born with rickets			2
if the boys ’ mother wanted to give them a treat , she would saw a boiled sweet in half with a bread knife			0
when war came , @entity2 and his brother were evacuated to @entity168 in @entity169 , then later to the @entity170 , a grand house in the @entity172 village of @entity173 , owned by a rich timber merchant , where their mother worked as a cook			2
it was there that the young @entity2 developed a taste for the finer things by eating the owner ’s left - over pheasant and caviar , sneaking sips of red wine and smoking cigar stubs he found in ashtrays			2
the indefatigable @entity2 has continued his seven - decade career by starring in the @entity190 series and the hit sci - fi movie inception with the family ’s home flattened in @entity196 , they returned to a prefab in @entity198 , @entity142 , after the war			1
but , in 1956 , when the fledging actor was 23 , his father died of liver cancer			0
later , in the @entity62 , after @entity2 found fame with films such as @entity204 , he bought his mother a large house in @entity207 , and a mink coat			0
but as the actor began to hit the big time , his relationship with his brother suffered			0
@entity8 lost touch with him until a chance encounter changed the course of his life			2
in his autobiography , @entity2 , who was knighted in 2000 , recalls shopping for a sofa in the @entity7 furniture store @entity220 ’s in the mid-sixties			1
‘ i asked to see one they had out the back , ’ he writes			0
‘ two blokes in overalls heaved it into the showroom for me , one of them turned in my direction and i saw it was @entity8			0
‘ i was really shocked to see him looking so shabby and felt terrible that he was working so hard to keep his head above water while i was ordering sofas without a second thought			0
’ he insisted @entity8 move into his @entity7 flat and got his brother , who was keen to act , small parts in two of his films , @entity60 and @entity240			1
soon @entity8 , who also dropped the surname @entity8 in favour of @entity2 , was a fixture alongside his brother at fashionable parties in @entity7 during the @entity62 , rubbing shoulders with the likes of models @entity250 and @entity251 and sharing a flat with @entity68 and hairdresser @entity252			1
@entity253 film actor @entity2 at home with his mother and brother , 1964			2
as the actor began to hit the big time , his relationship with his brother suffered then , in 1969 , @entity8 was cast as @entity260 , one of the robbers in @entity57 , which starred @entity2			1
but his hopes of matching his brother ’s success came to nothing			0
while @entity2 went on to appear in such classics as @entity267 and @entity268 — for which he won one of two @entity271 — @entity8 was forced to take on low - paid shop work again			1
but their story took another extraordinary twist when they discovered their mother had gone to her grave in 1989 keeping a tragic lifelong secret from them			0
before meeting their father , she had become pregnant in 1924			0
the baby , a son called @entity284 , was born in a @entity286 hospital suffering from epilepsy			0
to avoid the shame of raising a child out of wedlock , @entity147 agreed to put him in a mental asylum			0
but every monday of her life , except for the war years , she went out , claiming she was going shopping			0
instead , she would secretly visit her son			0
it was only after she died that it emerged she ’d given @entity284 pictures of his famous actor half - brother			0
she took a @entity301 with her on each visit so she could persuade new staff at the asylum to swear on it that they would n’t divulge her secret			0
after a newspaper revealed the heartbreaking story following her death , @entity2 and @entity8 often visited @entity284 , who was unable to speak because of brain damage caused by banging his head on the stone floors of the asylum during fits			1
the actor paid for a nicer room at the care home where @entity284 lived until his death in 1992			0

he ’s due to appear this year with @entity324 in the bank heist thriller @entity325			0
as for @entity8 , who suffered a series of illnesses in his final years , neighbours had become used to his increasingly frail appearance as he came and went from his down - at - heel home			1
to the very end , a chasm of wealth and success separated sir @entity2 and the little brother who so desperately tried to emulate him .			0

while @entity2 went on to amass a fortune , @entity8 ’s film career foundered and he made ends meet by working in @entity73 in @entity7
