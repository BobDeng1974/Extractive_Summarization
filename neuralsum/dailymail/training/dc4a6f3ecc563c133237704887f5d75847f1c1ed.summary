by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 knows it is ' all - or - nothing ' time for @entity4 and is confident of kick - starting their @entity6 campaign against @entity7			1
@entity9 's side earned many plaudits for the manner in which they excited and enthralled against @entity12 , yet saturday 's match ended in a frustrating 2 - 1 loss			2
defeat to the four - time champions is no disgrace but leaves @entity4 needing a positive result against @entity7 in @entity18 on thursday			1
let 's go ! @entity2 is confident of kick - starting @entity4 's @entity6 campaign with a win against @entity7 looking forward : @entity9 knows @entity4 realistically need something from the game in order to progress @entity26 's side are in the same boat after suffering an embarrassing 3 - 1 loss to @entity29 , meaning defeat would all - but end either sides ' hopes of making it out of @entity33 ' it 's massive for us , ' @entity4 midfielder @entity2 said			2
' we have to go all - out , but we know we need the win and we 're confident			2
' there were signs the other night that we 're close and the lads know that it 's all - or - nothing really			2
' we 've got great confidence in the camp and i 'm certainly confident that we 're going to get the win			0
' we knew from the start that we 'd be in a tough group and the @entity46 are a tough team , but we 're a strong team and we 've got a great group of players			1
' with just a few tweaks we can get this result			0
' those adaptations were worked on during a closed training session at @entity4 's @entity54 training base on tuesday			0
that 's better ! @entity56 is expected to play in a more central role against @entity7 on thursday it appears those changes will see @entity56 return to his favoured number 10 role against @entity7 , with @entity61 playing on the left and @entity63 wide right			1
' @entity65 had a day with the whole squad , working on a few things that he wanted to get across to the group , but as i said there were positive signs , ' @entity2 , likely to start from the bench again , said			1
' we know we need to improve on the result , definitely , and on the performance if we can			0
' if our performance is up there like it was the other night - and if we maybe work defensively on a couple of issues - then we 're certainly confident of getting the three points			0
' watching brief : @entity2 is expected to start the game on the bench and come on as it progresses in - form @entity83 completes @entity4 's exciting attacking quintet and , with more exciting talent waiting in the wings , @entity2 believes they will soon defeat a top side			1
' people have been talking about our creative play but i think it 's maybe about that final pass , final cross or final finish , ' the @entity90 captain added			1
' you can see that it 's there but it 's just about getting it over the line			0
one of these days we 're going to put three or four past a top team			0
' i see it in training , i see it in games , we just need that rub of the green and extra bit of confidence and then i think we will get that result			0

@entity90 captain likely to start on the bench this thursday
@entity56 will be moved to a more central role
