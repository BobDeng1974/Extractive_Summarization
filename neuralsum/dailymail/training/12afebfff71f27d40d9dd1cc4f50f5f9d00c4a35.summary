by @entity0 published : 19:04 est , 21 march 2013 updated : 11:52 est , 22 march 2013 let the insanity begin ! @entity2 kicked off with a bang on thursday with millions of @entity4 glued to the games to see how their brackets would fare in the early stages			0
as the @entity10 tournament brings out the bracketologist in all of us , one mathematician is encouraging people to keep expectations low because the odds are not in your favor			2
after running the numbers , @entity19 math professor @entity18 estimates there is only a one in 9 quintillion ( that 's a 9 followed by 18 zeros ) of filling out a perfect bracket			1
numbers do n't lie : depaul professor @entity18 showed the chances of a person filling out a correct @entity30 bracket and they ai n't good do the math : the mathematician showed that out of the entire @entity4 population , the likelihood of someone filling out a perfect bracket is less than 1/4 of 1 per cent professor @entity18 explained , ' if you 're just guessing [ while filling out your bracket ] , you basically have no chance			1
' the @entity41 university filmed the math whiz calculating the numbers in front of a whiteboard and as the computation unfolded , the results were enough to make even the most optimistic college basketball fan begin to despair			0
he explained how there are 64 teams in total for the bracket but only 63 are entered into his formula , because every team besides the ultimate victor will lose one game			0
there are two outcomes for each game and so to fill out a perfect bracket , someone must correctly predict the outcome for all 63 games			0
scientific methods : engineering students at @entity68 have built a computer model that predicts the outcome of the college basketball tournament , with @entity72 chosen as the 2013 victor mathematically this can be explained by multiplying 2x2x2x2x2 ... .63 times			1
that yields the astronomical number of 9,223,372,036,854,775,808 or 9 quintillion and change			0
but that chance is for the ordinary @entity80 who really knows nothing about the @entity10 and just wants to take part in the office pool and experience the cultural phenomena that is @entity2			2
the professor also created a formula that improved a person 's chances of accuracy , only considering those filling out the bracket who actually know college basketball			2
' if you know something about basketball , your chance of winning is one out of 128,000,000,000 , ' he said in the @entity100 video to publicize his formula			0
working off the assumption that everyone in the @entity4 had a working knowledge of basketball and filled out their brackets accordingly , the chances of one person correctly predicting the outcome for all 63 games are still pretty slim at less than 1/4 of 1 per cent			0
' when your bracket goes down the tubes , do n't worry so does everyone else 's ! ' he said somewhat reassuringly			1
barack - etology : president @entity116 filled out his bracket this week , selecting @entity118 to win the @entity10 men 's basketball championship but against all odds , engineers and scientists are still trying to put their knowledge to the test to predict the outcome			1
engineers at @entity68 â€™s @entity128 / @entity127 ( @entity129 ) college basketball ranking system have developed a computerized model to select the @entity10 champ			1
in the past five years they have correctly chosen the victor for three of those years			0
this year , the model predicts @entity72 , @entity134 , @entity118 and @entity135 will advance to the @entity136 with @entity72 and @entity135 playing for the title			1
@entity72 was selected as the presumed winner , according to the model			2
but as they say , those who ca n't ... teach			0
neither @entity19 or @entity68 made the tournament this year			1
expert : @entity143 estimates each teams ' chances of advancing in the college basketball tournament even the president takes part in the madness			1
on tuesday , he unveiled his bracket predictions with @entity134 , @entity118 , @entity151 and @entity72 reaching the @entity136 and @entity134 and @entity118 facing off in the championship			1
president @entity116 believes the @entity154 will claim victory			2
' i think this is @entity118 's year , ' he said on @entity158 , in a segment dubbed @entity116 - etology			1
coming off the heels of his successful presidential election prediction , statistician @entity143 applied his logic to the college basketball tournament			2
his bracket showed each team 's likelihood of advancing forward , predicting @entity134 as the most likely to win the title , with a 23 per cent chance of victory compared to @entity118 ( 18.4 per cent ) , @entity72 ( 13.3 per cent ) , @entity170 ( 8 per cent ) and @entity171 ( 5.9 per cent )			1
after the agonizing hours spent trying to rationally predict the outcome , @entity173 's @entity172 staged an intervention of sorts with his readers and provided a four step program for people to prepare to be disappointed with the @entity180			0
distance yourself from emotion before deciding2			0
honor your core priorities ' let 's be honest : your @entity10 tournament bracket is probably not going to win , ' he wrote in his piece on wednesday , though in the interest of full disclosure he did admit that he himself had never filled out a bracket in his life			2
with the likelihood of success at nil to none , college basketball enthusiasts should remember it really is about good fun			0
in the end , the @entity200 did n't make the tournament so how good could it really be ?			0

@entity19 prof calculates a 1 in 9,223,372,036,854,775,808 chance of accuracy
among @entity10 *aficionados* chances are 1 in 128,000,000,000
@entity68 computer model predicts @entity72 as the winner
statistician @entity143 estimates @entity134 as the most likely victor
president @entity116 says it 's @entity118 's year to win
' when your bracket goes down the tubes , do n't worry so does everyone else 's , ' mathematician says
