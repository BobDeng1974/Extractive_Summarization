by @entity0 published : 21:48 est , 3 july 2012 updated : 03:51 est , 4 july 2012 a newlywed couple whose big day was ruined by bungling wedding photographers who took ' horrific ' pictures have rewritten history after recreating the entire event - including their first dance			1
@entity9 , 27 , and husband @entity10 , 32 , were distraught when they received their badly framed and out - of - focus wedding photos			1
the couple had paid @entity14 and @entity15 £ 750 to cover their special day last august			2
but when their wedding album did not feature a single usable shot , they immediately complained			1
happy ever after : @entity9 and @entity20 have restaged their wedding after they received a nightmare set of photos from the original event in @entity27 , @entity28 , last august the original collection of shockingly poor photography included the back of guests ' heads and a snap of the bride 's mother whose face was completely obscured by her hat			1
the photographer failed to take a single frame of the groom 's parents at both the church and the reception , which was held at @entity45 near @entity27 , @entity28			0
one picture of the couple signing the marriage register appeared to feature a ghostly hand clutching a toy motorbike where the photographer tried to edit out mrs @entity9 's three - year - old nephew @entity51 , who was standing in the background			2
the images of the evening reception , which hosted 120 guests , were taken without a flash because one of the photographers complained about being epileptic			0
the couple , from @entity28 , demanded a full refund for the ' nightmare ' wedding album but received less than half after the firm , @entity64 , went bust			1
cut above the rest : a kind - hearted wedding photographer took pity on the couple after seeing the pictures and offered to do them again for free original set : an awkward side shot of the couple cutting their wedding cake - the photo 's framing is questionable at best and mrs @entity9 is n't even looking at the camera but now they finally have a perfect wedding album after photographers from all over the country inundated the couple with offers to recreate their special day for free			1
so the @entity85 returned to @entity45 to recreate some of the abysmal shots			2
one of the new photos shows the couple in the hotel grounds looking lovingly into each other 's eyes in a warm embrace , whereas the original had them standing awkwardly metres apart			0
and a fuzzy shot of the couple cutting their wedding cake was re-shot so that their grinning faces are clearly visible			0
the bridegroom 's parents , who did n't feature in a single shot in the original set , beam at the camera as they posed on the hotel steps			2
a shot of the couple 's first dance , which came out blurred , shows blushing bride mrs @entity9 twirling in perfect focus			1
first dance : the couple returned with their guests to the plush hotel near @entity27 , @entity28 , to reconstruct their wedding - including the first dance the original shot of the couple enjoying their first dance			0
wedding photographer @entity14 revealed the firm had gone bust shortly after the @entity85 ' wedding generous make - up artists and the local registrar gave their services for free to recreate last august 's £ 14,000 ceremony			1
mrs @entity9 said : ' we were really disappointed when we got the original pictures back because so much planning had gone into the day and the photos were unusable			2
' we were delighted when the local photographer agreed to recreate the wedding pictures			0
' it was lovely occasion and i loved the chance of getting dressed up in my wedding dress again - it was like getting married all over again			0
' we even recreated the first dance which was really special			0
' second chance : mr and mrs @entity9 pose in picturesque woodland as they recreate their special day love will tear us apart : a blurry shot of the couple at their reception venue just after the ceremony @entity149 , who runs @entity150 with her husband @entity151 , offered the couple the chance of a second wedding after seeing the original batch of pictures			1
she said : ' we heard what had happened and pulled a few contacts to give them the day they should have had in the first place			0
' no - one deserves to have their pictures ruined by photos that are n't very good			0
' they came to see the photos after they were done and were absolutely thrilled , they sat there crying with joy saying " this is how they should have looked "			0
' picture perfect : the @entity85 have finally got the wedding album of their dreams after restaging their big day inept : the couple said almost every shot they originally received was terrible - including a blurry shot of the including one of the happy couple walking through a doorway with a stack of cardboard boxes in the foreground this snap of the couple signing the marriage register appears to feature a ghostly hand clutching a toy motorbike - but it 's actually where the snappers tried to edit out @entity9 's three - year - old nephew @entity51 the back of a guest 's head appears in the foreground of this wedding shot			1
the photographers even failed to take a single frame of the groom 's parents not much better ! this photograph shows wedding guests turning to look at something more interesting behind them - and even the ones facing the front are n't looking at the camera blurry : the pictures of the evening do attended by 120 guests were also taken without a flash not in focus : the couple , from @entity28 , demanded a full refund for the ' nightmare ' wedding album but received less than half after the firm went bust a picture of the couple from behind and a shocking shot of the the couple at a distance at their wedding reception are not what anyone would expect from professional photographers cheers ! the guests are photographed - largely from behind - raising their glasses to the happy couple , who are nowhere to be seen in this picture the @entity235 staged their reception at @entity45 ( pictured ) in @entity27 , @entity28			1
this image was not taken by the wedding photographers			0
