the @entity0 is home to master magician @entity2 and @entity3 is under no illusion that it is he who will be disappearing from this mecca of boxing if @entity9 beats him here on saturday			1
in the final hours before his first bill - topping performance at this fabled arena , the @entity11 muslim who would be king of the prize - ring acknowledged : ‘ if i do n’t win this one i ’ll never get the chance of a shot at @entity20			1
’ worse still , he would not know what to do with life after next week ’s delayed celebrations of his 28th birthday @entity3 admits a dream fight against @entity20 wo n't happen if he loses to @entity9 @entity3 ( left ) will fight @entity9 ( right ) for the @entity28 welterweight @entity26 on saturday in @entity29 ‘ the loser , ’ he says , ‘ will have nowhere to go			1
’ well , in his case back to @entity32 and a domestic dust - up with @entity34 - maybe , reluctantly - but no return to this glittering @entity29 in the @entity37 desert			2
he says : ‘ neither me nor @entity9 can afford to lose if we want to go on to super-fights against @entity20 or @entity40			1
’ the word on the @entity29 is that a @entity3 victory over @entity9 – like himself , a former two - time world champion – will hoist @entity3 to the top of @entity20 ’s hit list for a multi-million dollar rendezvous in the spring			1
not that anything is ever certain when mr @entity47 comes to choosing his opponents , as @entity3 discovered to his cost a year ago			1
@entity3 could fight @entity20 ( pictured ) in may next year if he overcomes @entity9 at the @entity0 @entity3 age : 28 born : @entity32 , @entity11 nickname : king stance : @entity54 height : 5ft 9in reach : 71in fights : 32 wins ( ko ) 29 ( 19 ) : losses ( ko ) : 3 ( 2 ) @entity9 age : 27 born : @entity59 , @entity60 nickname : the @entity62 stance : @entity64 height : 5ft 9in reach : 70in fights : 28 wins ( ko ) : 26 ( 14 ) losses ( ko ) : 2 ( 0 ) on the promise of a @entity20 fight last may , @entity3 was encouraged to pull out of the december 2013 date originally set for this fight with @entity9			1
had he gone through with that and won , he not @entity34 would be a world - welterweight champion today			0
but then @entity9 lost that title to @entity73 , who was subsequently relieved of the belt by @entity34			2
now , even though the intervening 12 months have enabled him to grow into this star - spangled division from light - welter , @entity3 regrets that decision			2
he says : ‘ i ’ve learned a lot of things this past year and one of them is to go with the flow when opportunity knocks , not sit around waiting for something that may not happen			0
’ yet the boxing world works in mysterious ways			0
if anything , they are playing for even higher stakes in @entity90 this weekend			0
if @entity20 wishes to avoid facing the most menacing threat to his cherished unbeaten record – namely @entity40 – he needs a credible alternative opponent in the first half of next year			1
@entity9 , who has two career losses to @entity3 ’s three , says : ‘ once you get to the elite level a defeat always sets you back badly			1
but with so much at stake right now , this is definitely not the moment to lose			0
’ with than in mind , a measure of risk elimination has been applied by both trainers			0
@entity3 ( right ) has been urged by his trainer @entity105 to keep calm during the bout against @entity9 @entity105 is urging calm on @entity3 , warning him to temper his fighting instinct until he is absolutely certain he has @entity9 primed for a stoppage			1
@entity3 says : ‘ i think i ’m always exciting to watch but this will be a chess match before the fireworks display			2
@entity113 is top class and i will box him as well as fight him			0
’ @entity9 says : ‘ @entity3 will not be the only fast man in this ring			1
but if he is a bit quicker than me then he will find that timing always trumps speed in the end			0
’ given the high skill sets of both men the @entity123 could be putting on an evening for the boxing connoisseur , illuminated by bursts of explosive action			0
@entity3 accepts that he needs not only to win but to do so in impressive style if he is to nail down @entity20 and he says : ‘ i ’m primed to make a statement to the world that i ’m ready for the mega-fights			1
’ @entity9 ( right ) is confident his speed and timing will prove to strong for @entity3 on saturday perhaps the danger he must beware most is @entity9 being driven to over-achieve by emotional reaction to the civil unrest in his home city of @entity59			1
he hails from quite close to the neighbourhood of @entity138 , where protests about the shooting of an unarmed black teenager by a white policeman are ongoing and have been taken up in other cities across @entity60			0
his trainer , @entity144 , was born and bred in @entity138 and the pair of them ‘ want a victory to take back to our town and bring a little happiness to our people			0
’ @entity152 has been unwell this week and there is some concern whether he will be able to take his place in the corner			0
if not , what @entity9 loses in advice and encouragement may be more than compensated for by a motivating desire to win for his boxing father figure			2
@entity3 believes his move up to from light - welterweight to welterweight has given him extra punching power both protagonists believe they can win by knock - out			2
@entity3 talks of his additional punching power generated by the extra poundage he has put on while becoming a full welterweight : ‘ i ’m hitting much harder now			2
’ @entity9 subscribes to the popular theory of weakness in the @entity3 jaw : ‘ if you ’ re unlucky enough to be born with a suspect chin there ’s not much you can do about it			1
when you get hit , you go down			0
’ however , with chess - board strategy likely to check - mate the pyrotechnics , i expect @entity3 to box his way to a victory on points			0
* @entity185 will be televised live on @entity186 late this saturday night .			0
