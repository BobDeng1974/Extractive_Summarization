by @entity0 follow @ @ oliver_todd it might only be pre season but under @entity3 there is no such thing as a friendly for @entity6 as they take on @entity8 in their final @entity10 group game on saturday			1
the @entity11 have arrived in @entity12 ahead of their clash with the @entity15 champions , and @entity16 is looking forward to a game where he feels his new charges can best show their qualities			1
' we played against @entity22 , who were second in the @entity25 league , then against @entity26 , who were fifth in the @entity25 league , ' the new boss told @entity29			0
arriving in style : @entity3 and @entity31 take their first steps on @entity12 soil after a short flight cheeky chaps : @entity31 and @entity37 attend a signing session on their latest tour stop showing off : @entity41 follows @entity42 into the @entity43 on a publicity visit having a laugh : @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 enjoy themselves before the serious business of their match with @entity8 begins popular : @entity37 signs autographs at the airport after jumping off the @entity11 ' plane from @entity58 tears of joy : @entity49 evidently had something on his phone that @entity50 found funny in @entity12 ' now we play @entity8 and it is nice to play against such teams , so you can show you are at least equal			1
' @entity6 went on to visit the @entity43 in @entity12 after leaving the airport , showing off their new @entity69 - sponsored shirts at a session with fans - 109,000 of whom will be watching on when they face @entity8			0
a win or draw would see the @entity11 advance to a potential final showdown with @entity75 in @entity77 's @entity76			0
and that would give the former @entity80 manager an even better opportunity to check out the qualities of his players ahead of next season , with the @entity86 champions acting as the perfect benchmark			0
