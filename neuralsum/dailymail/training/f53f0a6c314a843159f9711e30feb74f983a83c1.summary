in 1961 , @entity0 was almost thrown into space and dragged back again inside a spherical vehicle known as @entity3 , while a few weeks later @entity5 @entity4 followed suit in a similarly primitive capsule known as @entity8			0
following in the footsteps of the @entity11 ’ @entity12 , @entity14 ’s @entity13 or the @entity15 1 , these spacecraft were the first vehicles to usher in a new era of transportation - space travel			1
and just like their siblings in other realms of transport , @entity19 would inspire a wealth of new designs and inventions as engineers across the globe rushed to fulfill the demand for new machines that would explore the stars - but among the handful of spacecraft that would be successful , there were a host of other designs that never made it off the ground			2
the perhaps appropriately named @entity40 , owing to its ultimate extinction , was just one of many designs for spacecraft that have materialised since the dawn of the space age in 1957			1
@entity40 would have been a reusable spaceplane capable of attacking a target nearly anywhere in the world at the speed of an intercontinental ballistic missile , achieved by travelling into space and diving back to @entity53 again at the dawn of the @entity59 , in october 1957 when the @entity56 ’s @entity55 ventured into orbit , it was the @entity60 ( @entity60 ) who first considered one of a few options for a fanciful spacecraft akin to science fiction			1
their initial project was the @entity40 ( ‘ @entity40 ’ ) , a reusable spaceplane with a single pilot that would be capable of launching into space and back again			1
as a project of the @entity60 , however , this was not something designed for civilian exploration like @entity75 ’s efforts that were to follow , but rather it was a military weapon that would be able to bomb distant targets with the speed of an intercontinental ballistic missile			1
the spaceplane , though , as it ’s name suggests , would have been capable of reaching space , and it was even thought to be able to orbit @entity53			2
among the pilots that were considered to fly it , chosen in secret , was successful test pilot ( and later first man on the moon ) @entity88			0
but the @entity60 soon ran into problems , namely there was no rocket that was deemed suitable to get the @entity40 into orbit , and it lacked a clear goal – thus , on 10 december 1963 , just as construction began , the project was scrapped			1
no , this is n't @entity75 's @entity97 - it 's the @entity56 's @entity99 shuttle , on the launchpad ahead of its sole flight in 1988 , which bears a large number of similarities to its @entity5 counterpart			1
its rumoured the @entity56 wanted to emulate the exploits of the @entity5 , and designed a vehicle that would rival the @entity97			1
despite one unmanned flight , however , the @entity99 was ultimately scrapped the research would prove invaluable in the creation of the @entity97 over a decade later , but the @entity40 also inspired some similarly ambitious designs			1
indeed , one was the @entity56 ’s own @entity97 clone that seemed to be an almost exact replica of @entity5 ’s newest space exploration vehicle			1
known as the @entity99 , development began in 1976 and it was intended to offer almost identical capabilities to the ‘ real ’ @entity97			1
it launched on a booster rocket , known as @entity119 , could perform operations in orbit and was also reusable ( aside from the booster that launched it )			0
the @entity99 would complete one unmanned flight in 1988 before the programme was scrapped following the dissolution of the @entity56 in 1993			1
and , even more tragically , the sole spacecraft that took flight was destroyed in 2002 when the hanger it was stored in collapsed			0
the @entity60 's @entity130 , conceived in the early 1980s , was intended as a mini-shuttle that could launch to and from anywhere in the world with ease			1
the purpose of it , much like the modern secretive @entity138 spaceplane , was not widely known , and it was scrapped before the concept took off another attempt at a @entity97 that never made full operation was the @entity60 ’s @entity130 ( @entity142 )			1
this small reusable spaceplane , not too dissimilar to the @entity138 that is in operation today , would have been capable of launching from anywhere in the world atop a mothership in the form of a @entity147			1
a small booster would have carried it to orbit before the @entity151 returned to land at an airfield on @entity53 – but again , this was a design that would never see the manufacturing floor			0
it was n’t just @entity5 and the @entity56 who were interested in fantastical feats of space exploration though - in 1975 the @entity159 ( @entity159 ) designed a space shuttle known as @entity161			1
development began with @entity163 in 1985 , with the vehicle intended to launch atop an ariane 5 rocket			2
it would carry a crew of three and almost the entire spaceplane would be reusable , save for a small resource module at the rear that would be shed before re-entry			0
by 1992 , however , the attempts at overcoming the challenges of building such a vehicle proved problematic , and @entity161 was soon consigned to the bin			0
@entity163 's @entity161 spacecraft was an ambitious effort from an agency that to this day is yet to design any sort of vehicle that could take humans into space			1
nonetheless it , too , was deemed as being the ' holy - grail ' of spacecraft in that it would be reusable and thus affordable , taking astronauts to and from @entity53 orbit on a regular basis another ambitious project was the @entity191 , part of the continuing effort by the @entity5 to create a single - stage - to - orbit vehicle that had no expendable components			0
it was first derived by @entity5 company @entity197 in the 1980s , with its main goal being to enable a crew of two to enter space and perform experiments			2
but a rather loftier goal set for the @entity191 was for it to become a passenger liner that could take people from @entity206 to @entity207 in two hours , leading president @entity208 to refer to it as the ‘ new @entity191 ’			0
the spaceplane would have accelerated to 25 times the speed of sound to achieve low - @entity53 orbit , before dropping down back into the atmosphere to land at its destination			0
the project was eventually terminated , however , due to major technical concerns and budget cuts			0
the @entity191 , artist 's illustration shown , would have been a passenger liner that used a scramjet - inspired design to reach speeds of 15,000 miles ( 24,000 kilometres ) per hour			0
it would have been 160 feet ( 50 metres ) long with a wingspan of 74 feet ( 23 metres )			0
it was scrapped due to technical concerns , particularly how to keep the crew safe at such high speeds a more recent dream for a revolutionary spacecraft was the @entity232 , a concept created by the @entity234 in 2005			0
the egg - shaped vehicle would have apparently been capable of taking dozens of people into orbit before returning to @entity53			0
if it sounds ridiculous , that ’s because it was - the project was soon quietly cancelled when it was realised that such a vehicle would be all but impossible to build			0
the @entity245 , artist 's illustration shown , was to be a huge passenger - carrying vehicle that would take paying customers into space			2
the single - stage - to - orbit vehicle would have been 77 feet ( 24 metres ) high with a diameter of 59 feet ( 18 metres )			0
the @entity253 spacecraft was quietly cancelled , though , when the technical difficulties were realised all of these spacecraft so far bear an obvious similarity - they were vehicles intended to take astronauts solely into @entity53 orbit for either lengthy or brief ventures into space			2
but there was one design that promised oh - so - much more when it was dreamed up in the days of @entity264 , when most regard3ed the moon missions as just a minor stepping stone to the ventures into deep space that were sure to follow			0
@entity269 , which stands for @entity269 , was not a spacecraft per - se but rather an engine for one that promised to take humans beyond the moon to @entity275			1
it was the first proof that nuclear thermal rocket engines were feasible , an engine far superior to the kerosene and liquid oxygen fuels employed by other spacecraft like @entity264			0
together with the @entity283 rocket , @entity269 was envisaged as the final cog that would make manned missions to @entity275 as early as the 1970s possible			2
perhaps the most innovative development that never flew was @entity269 ( schematic drawing shown ) , a nuclear thermal rocket engine that would have been the vital cog to enable manned missions to @entity275 , and also help to build lunar bases			2
sadly the programme was scrapped , although there are hopes its design could inspire future efforts to travel to @entity275 that all changed with the @entity297 – with the @entity264 missions struggling for support ( three later missions – @entity264 , 19 and 20 were cancelled ) @entity301 scrapped both @entity264 and ultimately the @entity283 rocket in favour of building a space station in @entity53 orbit , @entity306 , and eventually a reusable spacecraft that was intended to reduce the cost of going to space – the @entity97			1
and , sadly , despite numerous tests proving how successful such an engine could be , @entity269 was finished off in 1972			0
@entity75 had planned to use @entity269 to visit @entity275 by 1978 and create a lunar base by 1981 , but with its cancellation those dreams were gone			2
perhaps now , as @entity75 once more prepares to dream of missions to @entity275 , the research into the revolutionary @entity269 engine will make such missions possible			2
and even then , the designs of the other spacecraft that never flew serve as a reminder that , even though we may not have reached the lofty goals expected of space exploration so far , there has been no shortage of engineers and scientists shooting for the stars .			1

the launch of @entity55 in october 1957 *heralded* the dawn of the age of space exploration
various agencies around the world , caught up in the *excitement* , began dreaming up fanciful spacecraft
some would fly but many would be *confined* to the scrap , with some of the most amazing *detailed* here
these range from the @entity56 's @entity97 clone , @entity99 , to the @entity60 's @entity40 spaceplane
today many companies around the world are again dreaming up new designs , some with a goal of going to @entity275
