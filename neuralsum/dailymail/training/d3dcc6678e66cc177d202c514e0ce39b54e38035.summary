by @entity0 published : 19:19 est , 10 december 2013 updated : 19:26 est , 10 december 2013 @entity2 ’s flagship plan to extend free school meals to all five , six and seven - year - olds is today condemned as impractical and unfair			1
many primary school heads are warning they do not have the space or kitchen facilities to contend with the change for an extra 1.5 million children , which is due to take effect next september			1
some heads and governors still believe that it will be impractical for many schools to provide a hot meal by september 2014 , and they may have to offer a packed lunch instead			1
deputy prime minister @entity2 's plan to extend the free school meals programme to all five , six and seven - year - olds , regardless of how much their parents earn , has come under fire from primary school headteachers who say it is ' impractical and unfair ' a former @entity25 minister , meanwhile , said it was ‘ very odd ’ to be extending free school meals for all families with young children , even those who could well afford to pay for them themselves			1
despite @entity32 ’s vast budget deficit , mr @entity2 has announced that from next september , an extra 1.5 million infants in reception and years one and two will qualify regardless of their parents ’ income			2
the measure will save even the best - off families an average of £ 437 a year per child			1
the £ 600 million a year cost of the scheme is to be met through spending cuts elsewhere and moves to clamp down on tax avoidance			2
however , critics have questioned the coherence of offering free school meals for all families with young children , while taking the axe to other universal payments such as child benefit for the better - off			1
currently , free school meals are limited to the 400,000 poorest families , and many of those who are entitled do not claim because of the stigma attached to doing so			1
extending them to all under - sevens in state education is designed to show the coalition is taking further steps to help families with the cost of living			2
the £ 600million plan is part of a deal with the @entity69 that meant them agreeing to a similar sum being spent on a £ 200 tax break for married couples			0
last week , the government rushed out an announcement of an extra £ 150 million to fund new kitchens and dining halls , but many schools still warn of logistical difficulties in getting the policy in place for september 2014			1
@entity82 , head at @entity84 special school in @entity85 , @entity86 , who invested in a new server 18 months ago , said : ‘ we have built a special kitchen that ’s got warming and refrigeration but not actually the facility to cook			2
‘ i ’m fearful this could push things to the lowest common denominator			0
our suppliers simply ca n’t manage the quality that they do at the moment for high numbers			0
’ ‘ these kind of things get announced at a political conference and , as a head , you ’re absolutely bombarded			0
with the amount of stuff that comes through to you , you have to prioritise			0
’ despite @entity32 's budget deficit , mr @entity2 has announced that from next september , an extra 1.5million infants will qualify for the scheme			1
the measure will save even the best - off families an average of £ 437 a year per child @entity115 , headteacher at @entity117 primary school in @entity118 , said : ‘ the school was built in the 1990s at a time when space cost money , so we do n’t have any			1
' the hall is not only used for dinner times - it is our only internal @entity127 space			0
' we will probably have to stagger our lunchtimes to allow for the additional serving - up time that will be inevitable if numbers rise			0
this would mean a reduction in the amount of @entity127 we are able to provide			0
’ former @entity25 minister sir @entity135 said last night : ‘ this is not something that can be done on the back of a fag packet			1
in rural areas a lot of small primary schools do n’t have big halls where you can sit the whole school down			2
‘ and tragically in recent years many schools have got rid of kitchens and devoted the space to other uses altogether			0
former @entity25 minister sir @entity135 brands the decision to extend free meals to children whose parents can afford it themselves ' very odd ' ‘ there are 1.2 million children defined by the government itself as living in childhood poverty who do n’t get a free school meal			1
200,000 of those will get one as a result of this , but the other million will not , because they are older			0
‘ it ’s very odd to be providing a free school meal to 1.3 million children whose parents can perfectly well afford it and not paying out to one million whose parents ca n’t			1
it seems to me an odd sense of priorities			0
’ the @entity174 ( @entity174 ) warned many schools ‘ absolutely ca n’t think how they are going to do this ’			0
the organisation predicted that the government would have to u-turn on an initial commitment to providing a ‘ hot , nutritious meal ’ for all children			0
the commitment has already been refined to a pledge to ‘ ensure children get a healthy meal in the middle of the day ’			2
headteachers and governors still believe that it will be impractical for many schools to provide a hot meal by september 2014 , and they may have to offer a packed lunch instead			1
‘ we have pointed out the key challenges for schools , particularly if they ’re going to insist on a hot school meal			0
there is lots more flexibility if it ’s a packed lunch to the nutritional standards , ’ said @entity194 , of the @entity174			0
a @entity202 spokesman said : ‘ we know that regularly eating a nutritious school meal can help to increase a child ’s educational attainment			2
‘ free school meals for all infant school pupils will save parents an average of £ 400 a year , and make sure every child can get the healthy lunch that will help them do well at school			1
’ a spokesman for mr @entity2 insisted : ‘ the expectation is for the majority of meals to be hot			0
