injured flyhalf @entity0 did enough to prove his fitness to @entity3 coach @entity2 and win a berth in the @entity3 squad for the northern hemisphere tour			1
@entity0 , one of three flyhalves in the 34 - man squad named on monday , replaces @entity9 , who kicked the game - winning conversion against @entity12 on saturday			1
@entity0 will go on tour for tests against the @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 despite having barely played this year and still trying to overcome the effects of a broken leg sustained in the @entity22 final in august			1
@entity0 has been included in the @entity3 tour squad , despite breaking his leg in august @entity0 , pictured promoting the @entity25 in @entity26 , hopes to play against @entity16 on tour ' he 's been training without being able to play because he 's had a bit of nerve damage to the leg he broke , ' @entity2 told @entity32 in @entity33			1
' he 's getting better and better all the time and he 's extremely confident of being able to play			0
' he knows his body better than anybody and if he 's confident , i 'm confident			0
' while @entity2 said @entity0 was confident of getting through unscathed , @entity9 's conversion of @entity40 's 80th minute try that clinched a 29 - 28 victory over the @entity12 may not be his last act on the rugby field this year			1
' we 've spoken to @entity45 about the @entity47 situation , ' @entity2 added			0
' we 'll monitor @entity47 this week and get an idea of where he 's likely to be			0
@entity0 ( right ) broke his leg in the @entity51 in august , and has not played much this season @entity0 ( left ) is now back in training , and both he and coach @entity2 are hopeful he will be fit ' if @entity47 ca n't make this trip because of his leg then @entity9 will come back in			1
' @entity0 's inclusion despite having barely played this year suggests he remains firmly in @entity2 's @entity25 plans despite a horrendous run of injuries since the 2011 tournament			2
widely considered the best flyhalf in world rugby , he is likely to be the starting pivot in @entity16 next year with @entity64 and @entity65 , who shared the starting role this season while @entity0 was on a six - month sabbatical then recovering from injury , in the backup roles			1
@entity64 was supplanted by @entity65 as the starter for the latter part of the @entity73 after he was late for the team 's assembly time for their flight to @entity77 following a boozy night out and left at home by @entity2			0
the 25 - year - old @entity64 was brought back into the squad for the third @entity82 match in @entity83 but not named in the matchday team with @entity65 given the nod to start and @entity9 offering more versatility off the bench by being able to cover flyhalf , wing and fullback			0
@entity0 charges upfield during a match against @entity17 in 2012 , one of the teams @entity3 will face @entity0 prepares for a penalty kick , playing for his club side @entity95 in july 2014 code - swapping centre @entity96 was included after having played less than a full game of rugby since his return to the 15 - man code following two seasons with the @entity103 in @entity12 's @entity104			1
@entity96 had a successful stint in union that included a @entity25 win with the @entity3 in 2011 and a @entity22 title with the @entity109			2
however , with only five tests before next year 's @entity25 , @entity2 was keen to have the bullocking player involved as quickly as possible			0
lock @entity112 was a surprise inclusion after breaking his leg in @entity22 and not playing for five months			0
@entity2 said his selection was to get him up to speed with the team 's game plan and allow first - choice pairing @entity118 and @entity119 some down - time on tour			2
' @entity112 has n't played a lot of rugby due to injury over the last 18 months , so we thought it would be good to get him back into the @entity3 way , ' @entity2 added			2
the @entity3 face the @entity15 in @entity127 on november 1 before they meet @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 on successive weekends			1
