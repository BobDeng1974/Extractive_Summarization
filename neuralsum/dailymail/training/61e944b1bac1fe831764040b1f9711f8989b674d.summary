by @entity0 published : 07:43 est , 22 march 2013 updated : 07:58 est , 22 march 2013 digging up to four storeys beneath sprawling mansions to create even more space for cinemas and swimming pools has become something of a trend among @entity9 's mega-rich			0
but the days of plotting enormous basement developments could soon be over for the wealthy residents of @entity12 and @entity13 , after the council announced plans to put an end to the creation of so - called ' iceberg homes '			1
@entity22 billionaire @entity21 and @entity23 heir @entity19 are among those who have recently gained permission to add vast underground extensions to their historic mansions , leaving many neighbours up in arms			2
extensive : applications to create vast basement extensions have rocketed in @entity12 and @entity13 the number of planning applications for similar developments - often beneath properties that are centuries old - has rocketed in recent years , soaring from 64 a decade ago to 307 last year			1
but now the council is cracking down on the controversial practice , introducing new rules that will limit the extent basements can intrude into gardens , and restrict developments to a single storey in most cases			1
they would prevent future developments of the nature of that underway at mr @entity48 's £ 30million home ; a two - storey underground extension incorporating a gym , a 50ft swimming pool , a spa and a cinema			0
mr @entity21 's £ 10million refurb plan also includes a two - storey mega basement beneath his 17th century mansion			1
trend : @entity21 , left , and @entity58 , right with his wife , have both had plans for basement developments for their mansions in the borough approved the new rules include an outright ban on basement developments beneath the gardens of listed buildings , or where basements already exist - although the council has said exceptions might be considered in the case of very large sites			1
the authority has taken action following a study carried out into the impact of basement developments on the built and natural environment in @entity12 and @entity13			1
extensive : @entity23 heir mr @entity48 's plans incorporate a swimming pool , steam room , and separate store rooms for winter and summer clothes lavish : plans submitted to the council by @entity21 reveal the size of the development - the dotted lines indicate the footprint of the building at ground level cabinet member for @entity93 , cllr @entity94 , said of the draft policies : ' we do not argue for a ban on basement development , only for a better balance between them and the amenity of our other residents			0
if the cumulative impact of scores of schemes that take months and years to complete is to damage the wider quality of life in our borough i believe we have a right to take that into account			0
' @entity12 and @entity13 is an important heritage area with thousands of listed buildings , ' @entity113 said			1
' increasingly it ’s clear that major basement developments can be structurally very challenging			2
' because of that increased risk to the fabric of our precious heritage assets we believe we should adopt the precautionary principle and reduce the risk by limiting the scale of some of the developments we have been seeing here			0
' last year @entity130 cable television tycoon @entity129 submitted plans for an ' iceberg ' basement four storeys deep beneath his @entity136 home - a 19th century schoolhouse			0
in the summer of 2012 @entity139 banker @entity138 issued an apology to his neighbours in @entity12 after work on a basement extension to his £ 7million @entity145 townhouse saw cracks appearing in their homes			2
mr @entity138 , a managing director who heads @entity139 ' @entity149 and @entity150 financing group , offered to compensate his neighbours for the damage to their properties			0
