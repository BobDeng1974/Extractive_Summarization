and , it is possible that @entity8 distributed sensitive information through her personal email , the @entity1 has admitted , and only a review of her messages will determine if she broke the rules			1
the @entity1 first became aware of the email address when responding to a request form the @entity42 during the aftermath of the terrorist attack on the @entity46 consulate based in the @entity48 city of @entity49			1
when @entity1 and @entity0 officials noticed @entity8 's private email address on documents , they notified her personal staff and said they should take lead , since she was no longer a government employee			1
@entity8 spokesman @entity56 said staff believes @entity8 's email practices were not a cause for concern , nor did they break rules			1
' there was nothing to get ahead of , ' @entity56 said			2
' this was perfectly permissible and the practice of past secretaries , and not only did she turn over all pertinent emails , she has taken the extraordinary step of now asking them to be released to the public			0
when that ’s done , which we hope is soon , it will become clear that it ’s all in there and then some			0
' a @entity1 official who spoke to the @entity78 , however , acknowledged that some of the correspondence @entity8 sent through her private email may constitute a breach of security guidelines			1
the official said that @entity8 did n't directly defy @entity1 's policies by using her personal email for government communications , but a manual obtained by news outlets shows that since 2005 @entity1 has directed its employees to use its email system because it has the ' proper level of security control			1

but top communications gurus are recommending the campaign immediately act to deflate ' email-gate ' top communications gurus are recommending @entity8 ' steam immediately act to deflate email-gate			2
@entity104 in early states worry the scandal is an early warning sign that @entity8 's presumed presidential campaign is on the path to destruction and could ' implode '			1
from the outset , the @entity1 has cautiously avoided declaring @entity8 innocent of any wrongdoing while encouraging reporters to give her the benefit of the doubt			2
' she and her team has said that it was not used for anything but unclassified work , ' @entity117 , deputy spokeswoman for @entity1 told reporters on wednesday , adding moments later , ' i do n’t think there was any indication she was doing anything but [ that ] here , so i do n’t think it ’s really a pertinent question			0
' further pressed to ' definitively ' claim @entity8 was n't sending classified information through her personal email – which is against the law – @entity117 argued that ' you ca n’t claim that about anyone ’s unclassified email '			1
she also noted in the exchange that the department does n't monitor its other employees ' private communications to make sure that classified information is n't being shared			2
' i ’m not sure why this would be anything different , ' @entity117 contended			0
' i do n’t know why this would be held to a different standard			0
' when @entity8 did need to discuss classified information she communicated through her her staff , the @entity1 spokeswoman claimed			1
later asked if @entity8 's exclusive use of personal email was ' problematic , ' @entity117 stated that that ' there was no prohibition on this practice			1
' ' so i ’m not going to make a judgment about appropriateness or not , ' she said			0
' i ’m telling you what the regulations say and do n’t say			0
she operated under them , and that ’s as much as i can say			0
' guidelines published by @entity30 and other publications on thursday evening suggest otherwise , however			0
' it is the @entity1 ’s general policy that normal day - to - day operations be conducted on an authorized [ @entity165 ] , which has the proper level of security control to provide nonrepudiation , authentication and encryption , to ensure confidentiality , integrity , and availability of the resident information , ' the @entity1 's @entity161 says			2
@entity1 deputy spokeswoman @entity117 insists that mrs. @entity3 did n't send any classified material through her private ' clintonemails.com ' account while she led the agency an official who spoke to @entity30 said that it is true that ' sensitive but unclassified information should be handled on a system with certain security requirements ' with the caveat ' except in certain circumstances			2
' the @entity1 insider said it 's not true that ' by using personal email she is automatically out of step ' with the guidelines outlined in the manual			1
likewise , the @entity78 's source at @entity1 said , ' we are not going to prejudge the outcome of the review of secretary @entity8 ’s 55,000 pages of e-mails			2
' national democrats aligned with @entity8 are blowing off the email squabble as background noise that wo n't affect voters ' perceptions of their party 's most formidable presidential candidate			1
' voters do not give a s * * * about what email @entity3 used			0
they do n't even give a fart , ' @entity208 , confidante of and adviser to @entity8 , ' said thursday on @entity212			0
media matters founder @entity213 said in an op - ed on @entity212 that the media ' hype ' around @entity8 's emails is the ' perfect example of ' gotcha ' journalism , where reporters will take any bait the @entity9 give them without proper vetting			1
' @entity213 , whose group @entity223 runs a @entity225 fact - checking service called @entity226 , also argued that the @entity227 ' are held to a double standard when it comes to media scrutiny '			0
' their perfectly usual , above board behavior is spun as secretive and unaccountable - while @entity9 are left relatively unscathed , ' he charged			0
regardless , top - level communicators on the left and the right say that @entity8 currently risks mishandling the crisis			0
@entity237 , part i : likely @entity9 presidential candidate @entity239 goaded @entity8 to be more transparent @entity237 , part ii : @entity8 responded by saying ' i want the public to see my email ' and asking her old agency to hurry up the process former @entity247 senior adviser @entity246 has said that the longer @entity8 and her team wait to respond to the flurry of questions about her use of not only a non-official email for her work at the @entity1 but also a personal domain name and a private server , the likelier the situation is to get out of hand			1
' it ’s a ball of wool that wo n’t go away until the questions are answered , ' he told the @entity16 on thursday			0
@entity261 , a former spokesman for @entity262 , told @entity263 , @entity8 's team is ' making a big mistake ' by not letting her address the issue publicly			1
' this is immediately understood and problematic in the eyes of the average voter			0
everyone can relate to it and understand it … it cuts through the clutter in a way that hurts her , ' he said			0
' this is one of those issues that ’s not going away anytime soon			0
' @entity8 fired off a tweet on wednesday night saying she wanted the public to read her emails and had given the @entity1 permission to publish them once they it finishes its review			2
and a spokesman for her confirmed to the press at the beginning of the week that all of her emails that pertain to the @entity1 have been remanded to the federal government			2
questions continue to linger , however , and neither @entity8 nor her team have given a reasonable explanation for the former @entity247 administration official 's actions			2
@entity298 , chairman of @entity299 ’s @entity104 , told @entity30 the email controversy ' adds more reason ' for other politicians in the party to explore presidential campaigns			0
