on the cheeks i applied @entity131 , with their strobe cream on the cheekbones			0
' @entity135 lips were first lined with @entity97 naked 2 â€Ž and over the top of that @entity138 , that pink colour really popped against the green of her dress			0
' because @entity10 's dress was low - cut last night , we used @entity143 and body foundation on her arms and body and then @entity148 's @entity147 in silver so she literally dazzled on stage , ' he explained			2
he may have an arsenal of products on hand , but @entity61 maintains that @entity10 does n't need much help and he instead creates , what he likes to call , an ' enhancement of her natural look '			2
' in all honesty @entity10 leads such a healthy lifestyle that it shows in her skin , she has the most incredible complexion and her skin is naturally glowing - if you could bottle her " secret " then the @entity10 skincare range would be a best seller , ' he said			1
glow - getters : both judge 's make - up artists say the ladies are lucky enough to already have great skin that only needs a little touch - up as for @entity11 , she calls on her close friend and talented make - up artist @entity173 , who also works with @entity175 , @entity176 and @entity177 depending on what look they 're going for , it can take @entity181 between 30 minutes to an hour and a half to get @entity183 - ready			1
' there is always music playing in her dressing room ' , said @entity173			1
' it 's so much fun getting her ready			0
it gives us all time to catch up and have a gossip			0
it 's actually really organised			0
everything 's really neat and tidy			0
' we try to keep it like that but then in the last ten minutes when there 's a mad rush there ends up being make - up and hair products everywhere			0
' one of the main reasons that @entity173 loves working with @entity11 is because she 's so daring with her beauty look			1
last minute touch - up : @entity173 , who has also worked with @entity176 on their ten tour , gives @entity11 's lips a quick slick of gloss she 'll try anything ! @entity173 says the best part of working with close pal @entity11 is her versatility and willingness to try out new looks ' @entity11 's great because she 's willing to try anything which allows me to be really creative			1
she 's so versatile , she 's a make - up artist 's dream			0
one day it will be a natural , fresh - faced look , the next could be graphic and fierce , then soft , feminine and pretty look			0
there 's no one set look that we go for			0
' like @entity10 , @entity173 says that @entity11 is very lucky because she has incredible skin , which does n't require much work			1
' she 's really healthy and looks after her skin and that really shows in the make - up			2
i enhance this by using great skincare products like @entity234 face masks and moisturisers			0
i also use a luminous foundation on her , usually @entity237 , which allows her skin to shine through and look super radiant , ' she said			0
here they come ! judges @entity240 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity241 took to the stage on last night 's semi-final in @entity244			1
