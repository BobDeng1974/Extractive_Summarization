there are fears the @entity15 could quit his job before the @entity17 - throwing the team 's preparations into jeopardy			0
@entity3 told @entity15 broadcasters he disagreed with the decision of @entity8 bosses to axe @entity4 as captain before he has stood trial			1

former @entity8 chief executive @entity29 today said that the Â£ 6million - per - year @entity6 manager may be in breach of contract after he openly challenged the decision to strip @entity4 of the national team captaincy			1
' it is being taken very seriously by the @entity8 because it may be that @entity3 has breached his contract , ' said @entity29			1
' you have to ask what his motive is			0
you have to suspect he wants to prevent @entity4 retiring as a player before @entity42 but there are wider issues			0
' you could have what some of the media are calling a morality circus while @entity6 are trying to win the second major tournament in football			0
' a contract may have been breached , there is strong leadership now at the @entity8 from @entity53			1
last week he was n't slow to take things forward and he may not be slow to do so now			0
' @entity4 was axed as captain after a court decided he would not face trial over allegations he racially abusing @entity60 at @entity61 in october until july , after @entity42			2
interviewed by national @entity15 broadcaster @entity62 1 at @entity63 yesterday afternoon , where he attended @entity65 's thrilling 3 - 3 draw with @entity66 , @entity3 stated openly how angry he was			0
asked whether he was in agreement with ' the @entity69 's decision re @entity4 ? ' , @entity3 replied : ' no , absolutely not			2
' i have spoken to the chairman and i have said that , in my opinion , one can not be punished until it 's official and the court - a non-sporting court , a civil court - has made a decision to decide if @entity4 has done what he has been accused of			0
' i thought it was right that @entity4 should keep the captain 's armband			1
' the fact that the board has decided in this way is because it falls under the competence regarding ethics			0
' @entity3 is due at @entity87 today , where he will speak with @entity53 before heading to @entity89 for @entity92 's @entity91 encounter with @entity93			2
this morning bookmakers @entity94 slashed odds on the @entity6 boss quitting before the @entity42 finals get underway in june from 8 - 1 to 9 - 2			1
however , the fact he did attend yesterday 's game as planned would seem to be an indication he wants to continue in his job			0
in the stands : @entity4 sat out @entity65 's draw with @entity66 yesterday because of injury abuse : @entity107 , left , the brother of @entity60 and @entity4 's partner at centre - back in the @entity6 team , was booed by @entity65 supporters yesterday however , having challenged the @entity8 so openly about such a contentious subject , in the process raising the potential for fierce disagreement with individual @entity6 players , there has to be a possibility of @entity3 's tenure ending , four years to the day since his first game in charge , a 2 - 1 win over @entity123 at @entity87			1

@entity3 thought he had the right man in the @entity65 skipper			2
he was forced to revise that stance when an issue in @entity4 's private life led to @entity3 demanding his presence at @entity87 in february 2010 , when he was removed as captain and @entity107 installed as his replacement			2
on trial : @entity4 is accused of racially abusing @entity60 ( right ) last october in a match at @entity61 , and will appear in court on july 9 @entity60 then got injured during the first day of training at the @entity149 in @entity150 , meaning @entity135 got the job			0
then , after assessing the unseemly manner in which the armband was handed around during a friendly win over @entity155 in @entity156 12 months ago , @entity3 decided to give @entity4 the job back again			2
now that decision has exploded in his face once more			0
former @entity6 international and now outspoken radio pundit @entity160 has labelled the situation as ' a debacle and a shambles '			0
