follow all the movers and shakers here having decided their transfer business was done , @entity2 might be forced into a rethink on bringing in an attacking wide player following @entity7 's knee injury against @entity8 on saturday			1
less likely are high - profile departures from @entity10			0
there is no will to sell @entity13 to @entity14 or let goalkeeper @entity15 go on loan unless another @entity18 club guarantees him first - team action			1
@entity25 , 26 , impressed on loan at @entity2 last season and the club agreed a fee with @entity26 only for the player to fail to agree personal terms			2
@entity35 is on a purge of fringe players , with @entity38 gone and @entity39 travelling to @entity40 .			0

@entity2 could move for @entity25 following @entity7 's knee injury
potters are hoping to keep @entity13 at the @entity10
@entity15 also looks set to stay with the @entity44
