she has set up a @entity24 page to support her claim ms @entity26 told @entity27 : ‘ she was dehydrated , she seemed hungry , she seemed sad			2
she absolutely looked like a dog that nobody was caring for			0
’ @entity30 added : ‘ the dog had many ticks on it and its paws were raw , either from the hot sand or the hot asphalt			0
’ they both claim that the dog was n’t wearing a collar and that no other form of identification was visible			0
believing that they were being good samaritans , they called a vet to get the dog treated then contacted an @entity8 animal rescue centre to help process adoption of @entity1			1
however , when they returned from their vacation they received a message from an @entity8 resident called @entity21 who told the @entity14 that @entity1 was actually hers – and called @entity22			1
the @entity14 launched a crowd - funding page to help pay their legal bill and keep the dog stateside ms @entity21 , in a @entity24 page to support her claim , said that @entity22 ‘ only lives two minutes from the beach ’ and is used to going there ‘ with her best friends @entity58 and @entity59 , which live just next door ' that they ' all know their way home ’			2
as well as posting photographs and videos of the dog on the page , she published emails that she ’d written to the @entity14 , describing how she found her in 2011 at the front of her house and adopted her			1
