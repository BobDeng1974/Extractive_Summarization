@entity1 presidential candidate @entity0 laid down a marker tuesday on global warming , saying that denying human activity is heating the planet makes him a renegade truth - teller in the mold of the @entity9 astronomer @entity10			1
climate activists , he said in a half - hour videotaped interview , ' brand you a heretic ' if you disagree with them			2
' today the global warming alarmists are the equivalent of the flat - earthers , ' he told the @entity19			1
' it used to be : " it is accepted scientific wisdom the @entity23 is flat			1
" and this heretic named @entity10 was branded a denier , ' @entity0 said			1
' it 's not like @entity52 was going to endorse him , and now suddenly they 're not , ' an @entity50 @entity1 political consultant told @entity54 , describing @entity0 as ' a smart guy whose new pronouncements will cost him nothing			0
' @entity31 , according to a @entity59 poll released wednesday , ranked climate change at the bottom of a list of six environmental concerns , with those saying they care a ' great deal ' falling by 2 percentage points since last year			1
' even as global warming has received greater attention as an environmental problem from politicians and the media in recent years , ' pollsters wrote , ' @entity31 ' worry about it is no higher now than when @entity59 first asked about it in 1989			1
' and then there 's @entity10 : the story goes that he aroused the ire of @entity79 by contradicting @entity81 teaching at the time , which held that the @entity43 revolved around the @entity23			2
he was forced under pain of death in 1633 to recant his claim that the @entity23 revolved around the @entity43 , but calmly said after his release from a dungeon : ' @entity88 ' – @entity90 for , ' and yet it still moves			0
' @entity0 's ' flat - @entity92 ' epithet is likely misplaced , since @entity10 never staked his career on a claim that the @entity23 itself was round			1
that was well - known by the time he was an influential scientist			0
but the @entity32 senator 's @entity10 analogy is a direct slap at environmentalists , calculated to set him apart from more moderate republicans expected to enter the presidential race soon			2
@entity0 can fire up his base and raise money quickly , the @entity50 consultant said , by ' casting himself as a swashbuckling crusader ' against the economic impacts of limits on carbon emissions			0
' you know , we should n't be causing millions of hard - working men and women to have their energy bills go through the roof , ' @entity0 said tuesday , talking about what he sees as the result of government climate policy			2
' it causes real harm and suffering when people all across this country lose jobs because the federal government wants to take control of aspects of our lives			0
... that 's not something we should do lightly , ' he said			0
@entity0 's wide - ranging interview touched on @entity134 , gay marriage , marijuana policy and his disdain for ' one - size - fits - all ' legislative approaches often crafted in @entity140 but it 's his position on carbon emissions and the fate of the planet that will likely raise the temperature of his opponents on the left			1
' i am the child of two mathematicians and scientists			0
i believe in following evidence and data , ' @entity0 said			0
' and the global warming alarmists , anyone who actually points to the evidence that disproves their apocalyptical claims , they do n't engage in reasoned debate			1
what do they do ? they scream , " you 're a denier "			0
' climate tycoon : ' @entity164 has made millions of dollars off of global warming , ' @entity0 said global cooling ? bostonians would be hard pressed to fret about rising temperatures following one of the snowiest winters on record this year as evidence , he pointed to data from heat - sensing weather satellites			1
' the satellite data demonstrate that there has been no significant warming whatsoever for 17 years , ' he emphasized			1
' now that 's a real problem for the global warming alarmists			2
because all those computer models on which this whole issue is based predicted significant warming , and yet the satellite data show it ai n't happening			1
' he also said the federal government itself is perpetuating a money - mill premised on a scientifically bankrupt ideology			0
' there are an awful lot of people making a whole lot of money , ' he said			0
' @entity164 has made millions of dollars off of global warming			2
and a lot of these scientists who are most vocal about it are receiving massive grants on this theory that the data are not backing up			0
' a @entity203 blogger hammered @entity0 on wednesday , calling his comments ' just baffling			2
' ' scientists that studied the satellite data to which @entity0 refers , ' @entity203 writer @entity205 wrote , ' reject the idea that it somehow disproves the idea that human activity is making the world warmer			1
' ' @entity0 's comments , from start to finish , are simply not correct , ' @entity205 claimed			1
adding insult to insult , the @entity217 editorial board wrote wednesday that @entity0 's campaign was ' off and bumbling , ' castigating him for ' positioning himself against an overwhelming consensus among the world ’s preeminent climate scientists			2
' that followed a sunday interview on the @entity228 program ' @entity229 ' where @entity232 @entity231 gov. @entity230 said @entity0 's position on global warming makes him ' absolutely unfit to be running for office			1
' but the senator is n't backing down			0
' @entity88 ' : @entity10 was forced under pain of death to recant his claim that the @entity23 revolved around the @entity43 , but when he was let out of prison he still insisted : ' and yet it still moves ' ' i read this morning a @entity244 article from the 1970s talking about " global cooling " , ' he told the @entity19			1
' and it said the science is clear , it is overwhelming , we are in a major cooling period , and it 's going to cause enormous problems worldwide			0
... now , the data proved to be not backing up that theory			0
' then , he recalled , ' advocates of global cooling suddenly shifted to global warming			1
' and later , he said , the terminology changed again to ' climate change			2
' at each stage , @entity0 claimed , green activists promoted central authority over the nation 's energy economy as a solution			0
' when someone keeps proposing the same solution regardless of the problem , you start to think maybe they just like government control of the energy sector and every aspect of our lives , ' he jabbed			0
@entity0 's home state of @entity32 is famed for its oil and gas wells , and for its @entity280 refineries			1
his position is most typically backed by politicians who represent @entity31 in other energy - rich states like coal - wealthy @entity285 and oil - heavy @entity286			0
a @entity0 spokeswoman did not respond to a request for clarification about how he resembles @entity10 .			0

in @entity32 interview , he says it was once ' accepted scientific wisdom the @entity23 is flat , and this heretic named @entity10 was branded a denier '
claims 50 - year swing from ' global cooling ' to ' global warming ' and then to ' climate change ' shows *liberals* just want to control the @entity31 economy
' the satellite data demonstrate that there has been no significant warming whatsoever for 17 years '
the @entity203 branded @entity0 's comments ' just baffling ' and said *lengthy* ' warming *hiatus* ' does n't change global warming reality
new @entity59 poll finds @entity31 rank climate change at the bottom of a list of six environmental concerns
