by @entity0 published : 16:54 est , 1 september 2013 updated : 18:12 est , 1 september 2013 road to recovery : @entity2 appeared healthy and composed this week as he prepares to leave court - ordered rehab for two months , @entity2 hid his crack addict wife ’s body in their £ 70million mansion as he struggled to face up to her death			1
so as the @entity12 heir prepares to return home from rehab for his own drug abuse , it is perhaps only natural he is keen to make a few changes to the place			2
as one of @entity19 ’s richest men , of course , he has the resources to do it in style – and has plumped for a luxurious two - storey basement beneath the sprawling @entity26 - listed property			1
the approved plans reveal that the underground development will include a swimming pool , gym , cigar room , wine store , plant room with rain water harvesting tank , cinema and lift			1
it will create 1,594 sq ft of extra floor space beneath the home , which is formed of two five - storey 19th - century townhouses and three linked mews buildings			2
the property , in @entity44 ’s @entity43 , already features a ballroom , courtyard , staff quarters and garages for up to seven cars			0
@entity2 , 49 , heir to the £ 4.3billion @entity12 fortune , is the latest member of the super-rich to join the trend for ‘ iceberg ’ homes , where owners dig down below ground to create more space than traditional extensions			2
based on other recent projects nearby in the wealthy borough of @entity62 and @entity63 , it is estimated @entity2 ’s basement – which is equivalent in size to nearly three average terraced houses – will cost £ 2million to build			0
and it is not only his house which is undergoing a transformation			0
photographed this week leaving the @entity70 in @entity63 with a blonde woman said to be a ‘ family friend ’ at his side , @entity2 looked as though his treatment was doing him a power of good			0
his healthy appearance was in stark contrast to his gaunt look in early may 2012 , days before the death of his 48 - year - old @entity81 wife @entity80			1
he was still sporting the beard he has grown since entering rehab , but the walking stick , @entity85 - style cap and unflattering hooped polo shirt he was seen wearing three months ago were all gone			0
instead he was dressed smartly in a sports jacket and open - necked shirt , his wedding ring clearly visible on his finger			0
mrs @entity93 ’s remains were found in the couple ’s second floor bedroom at the house last summer after her husband was arrested on suspicion of possessing drugs			0
improved : the 49 - year - old heir was pictured looking gaunt and disorientated in may last year ( left )			1
one year on , ( pictured right ) he is planning to rejuvenate his @entity43 home where his wife @entity80 died addiction : the society couple had allowed their 50 - room @entity63 mansion to fall into disrepair and lived in a small part of the property before mrs @entity93 's death in may last year he had hidden her body for two months while maintaining a desperate pretence to servants that she was alive			1
@entity2 was convicted of preventing her lawful burial and handed a ten - month suspended jail term			1
the judge at @entity119 said @entity2 was a tragic warning of the ‘ utterly destructive ’ effects of drug abuse			0
he moved out of the house last year to undergo a rehabilitation programme at a private clinic			0
denial : mr @entity2 hid his wife 's body as he struggled to come to terms with her death			1
the 48 - year - old was a regular at sociaety parties ( left ) but spent her last years as a recluse ( pictured right in may last year )			2
