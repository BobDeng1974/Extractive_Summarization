three quarters of sunbeds have failed safety tests in undercover checks by officials			1
salons are using beds three times as hot as the @entity9 outback â€“ putting unsuspecting clients at risk of serious skin conditions such as cancer			2
in the worst cases , sunbeds breached the legal limit by as much as three times , emitting uv rays too hot to ever occur on earth			1
many salons are using sunbeds three times as hot as the @entity22 - putting users at risk of skin cancer - an investigation by @entity26 has revealed tanning salons , hairdressers and nail bars with sunbeds caused the most concern , while sunbeds in gyms were found to have much higher levels of compliance			1
now , even the tanning industry has joined calls for tougher action against rogue operators			2
the latest shock figures come from @entity42 's @entity41 - but there are fears the problem could be nationwide			0
the report revealed that 75 per cent of sunbeds failed to meet the legal limit for an acceptable level of uv radiation			1
undercover officers found sunbeds emitting radiation at between 1.5 and 2.5 times the legal limit - a level hotter than the sun in the @entity22			1
the investigation began after complaints from customers that the tanning beds were too hot			2
it involved @entity26 officers donning protective radiation suits to check uv levels			0
tests carried out earlier this year in @entity66 found 89 per cent of beds failed to meet the legal safety limit			1
lamps in sunbeds can use a level of @entity72 no more powerful than the legal limit of 0.3 watts per square metre , which is the equivalent of the sun on a hot day in @entity76			1
however , investigations in @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , and @entity82 revealed some sunbeds were belting out 0.9 watts per square metre , a level of solar energy too hot ever to be found on earth			1
some beds were pumping out 0.9 watts per square metre , three times the legal limit and a level of uv radiation too hot ever to be found on earth similarly , an inspection of all the sunbeds in @entity96 carried out in march found that eight out of 10 sunbed salons failed to comply with the rules			1
the average level of radiation they found was 0.49 watts per square metre , with at least one bed emitting 1.18 watts			1
officials underlined that while 0.3 watts can be compared with a hot day on the beach in the @entity106 , 0.9 watts is completely off the scale			1
the @entity26 investigation began after complaints from customers that the tanning beds were too hot @entity112 , of @entity113 's @entity41 said : ' such levels of uv radiation do not occur anywhere on the earth 's surface			2
not even 0.6 occurs anywhere on earth			0
' a @entity26 officer for @entity42 said the beds that failed the tests were all suspended from use until the bulbs were repaired or replaced			2
officers will now expand the survey to cover the whole county			0
they added : ' as we move into autumn officers warned people who may be tempted to use sunbeds to maintain their holiday tan , that they may be risking serious skin damage and worse			0
' @entity135 , chairman of @entity136 , joined in calls for further regulation to keep the public safe			0
he said : ' we welcome @entity42 's efforts to ensure sunbed businesses are operating within the law			0
' our code of @entity145 requires our members to operate to best practise but beyond our membership we are aware that not all tanning businesses operate to such high standards			0
' we very much hope that now these tests have been taken , the @entity42 uses its powers to ensure compliance , so that all sunbed businesses are operating on a level playing field			0
' only the local authority has the powers to ensure compliance and where this is properly enforced across the board , experience dictates that the vast majority of salons comply			0
' we would encourage the @entity42 to take swift action against any salon that resists compliance			0
' we would always recommend that anyone looking to use a sunbed , seeks out a member of @entity136 , where they are assured of receiving correct advice and information from properly trained staff about responsible tanning			0
