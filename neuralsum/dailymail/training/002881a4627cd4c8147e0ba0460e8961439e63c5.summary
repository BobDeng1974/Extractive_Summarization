by @entity0 published : 19:57 est , 6 august 2013 updated : 19:58 est , 6 august 2013 pushy parents are damaging their children ’s chances of getting into university by becoming personally involved in the admissions process , a leading headteacher has warned			1
mothers and fathers are increasingly contacting universities themselves , thinking they will help secure a place on a good course for their child			1
but @entity15 president @entity14 warned it could have the opposite effect - and told teenagers not to let their parents near the phone			1
confidence : a leading headteacher says students must pluck up the courage to speak to universities themselves ‘ it comes down to the whole “ helicopter parenting ” thing , ’ said mrs @entity14 , who is also head of @entity26			1
‘ it is better to have an over-interested parent than uninterested parent and you can understand why they want to be involved because their children are making a huge investment now in their university education			2
but there must be boundaries to this			0
‘ now is not the time to be nervous on the telephone and it ’s certainly not the day for letting your parents fight your battles for you			1
‘ by all means discuss your options with them but if you have to talk to universities you ’re on your own			2
’ she was backed by @entity52 , head of sixth form at @entity54 near @entity55 , @entity56			0
‘ if you have to ring universities to confirm or re-negotiate your place , it goes without saying that it must be you who calls , ’ she said			1
‘ under no circumstances allow your parents to call on your behalf because that will send entirely the wrong message about your maturity and commitment			2
’ the warning comes the week before hundreds of thousands of teenagers get their a-level results			0
advice : students applying for university places should not allow parents to call up on their behalf , experts say those who do not automatically win a place can enter the clearing system			1
some who get better grades than expected can also try trading up to a better university or course			0
parents have increasingly been taking an active role in the process of applying to university as costs have soared - making the return on the investment more important			1
students starting courses this year will pay up to £ 9,000 in tuition fees alone			0
once living costs are taking into account , debts can spiral to more than £ 40,000 for a three - year course			0
adding to the frenzy this year is the decision of an unprecedented number of elite @entity99 universities , including @entity100 and @entity101 , to offer places through clearing			2
half of teenagers were accompanied by parents at university open days in 2011 , according to one survey			0
two years earlier the figure was 47 per cent			0
mothers and fathers are also exercising their influence by filling out their application forms and fighting appeals on their children ’s behalf , according to universities			1
@entity118 , headteacher of @entity119 in @entity120 , @entity121 , also advised students who do n’t make the grades they want to demonstrate their independence to admissions tutors			0
‘ the most important thing is for you - not your parents - to talk to the university concerned , then look at clearing , ’ she said .			0
