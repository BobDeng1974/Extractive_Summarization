a secret eater who gorged on midnight snacks while pretending to eat healthily throughout the day has lost more than a stone - after taking up weight lifting			1
@entity5 , 23 , used to regularly binge on bars of chocolate before bed after a day of munching on salads - or sneak in sweets while on the way to the gym			2
now a slim size 8 , @entity14 , from @entity15 , @entity16 , managed to drop two dress sizes and more than a stone in just 12 weeks after ditching the late - night treats and taking up weight training			1
by ditching the secret snacking @entity14 managed to drop from 10st 5lb ( left ) to 8st 11lb ( right ) at night @entity14 often found herself sneaking back downstairs to devour whatever she could get her hands on @entity14 , who went from 10st 5lb to 8st 11lb said : ' even though i was eating well during the day , i was n't losing the weight i felt i should have			1
' appearances can be deceptive because i was coming home most evenings and tucking in to sugary treats			2
' having been slim throughout her teens , when @entity14 started work as a retail assistant , her busy routine meant she strayed to eating junk food and sweets			1
she said she could easily get through a packet of biscuits in just a day and always had sweets in her pocket or in her car to eat while on the go			0
desperate to curb her expanding waistline , @entity14 started going to the gym and skipping breakfast			1
ditching secret snacking for weight training , @entity14 has transformed her body , pictured before , left and after but what she could n't put a stop to was her sweet tooth , and despite her efforts to stay slim during the day , at night she often found herself putting her pyjamas on and then sneaking back downstairs to devour whatever she could get her hands on			1
even spending hours on the cross-trainer every week could n't fight against her snacking habits			2
exasperated at her lack of progress , she decided to try a different approach to shift the pounds			1
@entity14 started a 12 - week body transformation programme which meant cutting out all the sweet treats she lived on , and taking up an intensive gym schedule with weight training			1
instead of biscuits and toffee sweets , dessert became protein - based puddings that enhanced , rather than hindered , her training			2
instead of biscuits and toffee sweets dessert became protein based puddings and in 12 weeks she had lost 11.2cm from her waist and 5.6cm from her hips			1
@entity14 said : ' i was going to the gym and then coming home and eating junk food - it really defeated the point			1
' because i felt i 'd been good all day , i really wanted something naughty to eat and i felt i 'd earned it			0
' it became my secret habit - i did n't tell anyone that i was snacking away on chocolate after everyone else had gone to bed			2
' thankfully doing the @entity90 programme helped me stay on the straight and narrow			0
' when you 've got a programme to stick to , it makes it so much easier			0
i needed the motivation it gives you to keep going and not give up			0
' i genuinely believed that running around and getting cardiovascular exercise should have been enough			0
' never did i think in a million years that weight training would help me but it was on the programme so i thought , " ok , i 'll give this a go "			1
' the results were incredible			0
people at work noticed and even asked me if i was eating enough			0
' i had to keep reassuring them , " i am eating more than you can imagine ! "			0
' i 've always loved my food and could never have done a diet where it meant cutting out all important calories			0
' this way i 've changed my attitude to food - no more midnight snacks for me - and gained an all - round healthier lifestyle			0
' and i have achieved my dream body and the confidence i 've always wanted			0
