by @entity0 residents in the @entity3 province of @entity4 have decided to tell the world that they are alive and well and living perfectly normal lives despite the recent nuclear disaster by recording a music video with @entity10 ' hit song @entity11 as the soundtrack			1
@entity13 , a 53 - year - old consulting firm manager in @entity4 , came up with the idea of creating a @entity4 version of the song after learning on the internet of a widespread misunderstanding that people can no longer live in the region due to the nuclear accident caused by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami			1
about 200 people , including @entity4 mayor @entity25 , small children , @entity28 monks , and people from all walks of life in the area appear in the video and dance in their own styles			1

and many thanks to @entity10 for this great song			0

there were also well over 1,000 comments on the @entity4 version with many people declaring that it was the best use of the hit song yet			2
one user wrote : ‘ [ the video ] cheered me up ’ and another added ‘ is it really filmed in @entity4 ? ’ @entity4 station master @entity108 , who appeared in the video , said : ‘ i hope that the video shows how attractive @entity4 is			2
’ volunteers in @entity112 , @entity113 , and in @entity114 , @entity115 , are also working on their own ‘ happy ’ videos , which are expected to be released from early july			0
more than three years after the march 2011 meltdowns , the @entity4 plant is still plagued by a massive amount of contaminated water			2
