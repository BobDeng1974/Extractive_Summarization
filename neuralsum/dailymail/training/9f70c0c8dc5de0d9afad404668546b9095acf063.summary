by @entity0 , political reporter support : the proposal is backed by some of the prime minister 's closest allies including education secretary @entity6 newly retired workers from a range of different fields will be parachuted in to teach at @entity11 ’s toughest schools under @entity13 manifesto plans			1
recent retirees will enrol on an intensive course to retrain as teachers , before being fast - tracked into schools in inner cities and other deprived areas			1
the @entity21 programme will be based on @entity22 , which has seen thousands of high - flying graduates heading into the classroom			1
it is hoped it will encourage professionals from a broad spectrum of careers to work as teachers before fully retiring , using their experience to educate the next generation			2
the proposal is currently being considered by @entity34 and mp @entity35 , @entity37 ’s younger brother , who is drafting the @entity13 ’ general election manifesto			1
it is supported by some of the prime minister ’s closest allies and is the brainchild of the @entity43 , which presented the idea to him at @entity46			1
one of those involved in the presentation said : ‘ @entity22 has seen a lot of talented younger people going into schools before embarking on other careers			2
this would follow the same logic but in reverse , with people who have already had careers opting to go into the classroom			0
‘ for example someone who has been working as a chemical engineer might teach science and would have a lot of experience to give to younger people			0
’ the @entity43 includes about a quarter of the 305 @entity13 mps and promotes ‘ a modern progressive conservatism ’			1
it is made up of some of mr @entity34 ’s most loyal supporters , with education secretary @entity6 among its members			1
the group , which was founded by energy and climate change minister @entity74 , also includes ministers @entity75 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81			0
one member said @entity83 was one of a ‘ whole range of exciting , aspirational and optimistic ideas ’ that had been presented for consideration			0
@entity22 has seen thousands of high - calibre graduates enter the classroom after just a six - week course in teaching			1
founded by former @entity93 business consultant @entity92 in 2002 , it takes on more than 1,000 graduates a year with 2:1 degrees or above , who want to avoid the traditional teacher - training path			2
originally aimed solely at secondary schools in @entity99 , it has been expanded to include primary schools and now covers ten regions across @entity102 and @entity103			0
@entity22 has proved popular with students wanting to try teaching , but has been criticised by unions , which argue that participants do not receive enough training before they are placed in charge of a class			2
before starting in schools , participants attend the @entity113 , a residential course where they study educational theory and practice			0
trainees are required to stay in the classroom for only two years , and many sign up to hone skills such as communication , which they believe will help them in future careers in different fields			0
but more than half stay in teaching and the most successful are fast - tracked into senior roles .			0

retirees will enrol on an intensive course to retrain as teachers
teach seniors will be based on @entity22 , a training course for graduates
backed by @entity34 's supporters including @entity6
brainchild of @entity43 which includes about a quarter of 305 @entity13 mps
