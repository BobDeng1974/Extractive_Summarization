is there any sport better at self - criticism than @entity3 ? here we are barely 24 hours after watching one of the greatest drivers ever to turn a wheel , @entity8 , winning the @entity10 @entity9 in the most advanced car ever devised , yet some people have already applied the match to the paraffin			1
nobody sane would suggest that sunday 's race was the most thrilling ever staged , but to call for rule changes to condense the field is ludicrously premature			2
@entity8 celebrates his @entity10 gp win in front of second - placed @entity21 and @entity22 @entity8 stormed to victory at the season - opening @entity10 @entity9 following a dominant performance @entity21 followed @entity8 home as @entity26 picked up where they left off with total domination i remember when , in 2010 , refuelling was done away with and the season started with a horrific bore in @entity32			1
calls for the immediate rewriting of the regulations followed then , too			2
that urge was resisted and a fine season unfolded : four drivers contested the final round			2
even last year , with @entity26 dominant , there were some memorable races – the best of them , this time , in @entity32 , with heart - in - your - mouth , wheel - to - wheel scrapping throughout the field			1
we should also provide some perspective			2
for most of the sport ’s history , the field was far more spread out than now			0
laps upon lap , minute upon minute , were not uncommon gaps in the oily - rag days of yore			0
sir @entity54 , for example , beat his nearest challenger , @entity55 , by 5min 12.75sec to win the @entity56			0
you can not legislate to make every grand prix interesting any more than you can make every football match interesting			0
or every boxing match , or every athletics race			0
thank goodness , too , because the thrill of sport would be diminished if we arrived knowing what to expect			0
yet , unlike in football , @entity3 feels an insatiable need to reinvent itself to ‘ improve the show ’			1
the navel - gazing is totally boring and counterproductive			0
@entity8 and @entity21 ( right ) shake hands after @entity26 pair finished more than 30 seconds ahead of third @entity8 sprays champagne from the rostrum as he celebrates the 34th grand prix victory of his career @entity78 cruises to victory in @entity10 gp it is also mostly self - serving			1
teams cry for changes when they are failing to match their opponents , as @entity85 ’s @entity84 did in calling for @entity26 to have their grunt reined in			1
@entity87 responded by telling @entity84 and the rest to get their ‘ f * * * * * * heads down and work hard ’			1
yes , is @entity3 not about striving for the best , winning the arms ’ race and getting your super-rich rewards ? in passing , it is worth pointing out that the teams are far too powerful			1
the @entity98 , now presided over by @entity99 , should surely be leading @entity3 rather than following the consensus			1
if the sport does need an injection of competitiveness , we look to @entity21 to play his part by challenging @entity8 in a way he did not manage in @entity107			1
last year see - sawed until @entity8 took near total command towards the end , and there is no reason to believe that @entity21 may not get the better of @entity8 at some stages this year			1
but for now we should celebrate the brilliance of @entity8 and his @entity26 machine , and stop moaning			1
hollywood star @entity116 interviews @entity8 after his winning start to the season @entity85 chief @entity84 is concerned that @entity26 dominance will be unhealthy for the sport @entity85 ’s motorsport adviser @entity121 has warned , not for the first time , that the drinks company is considering leaving @entity3 because the rules are not to their liking			1
this threat should be wafted away			0
it probably is not genuine , but , even if it is , so what ? global companies such as @entity26 , @entity130 and @entity131 use the platform of @entity3 to promote themselves so long as their boardrooms see an advantage in doing so			1
then , when it no suits them , they suddenly stop			0
it is nothing to do with the regulations or the state of the sport			0
understanding that is crucial to knowing there is no point bending over backwards to pacify transient visitors			0
@entity84 's @entity85 team won consecutive titles between 2010 - 2013 with @entity22 behind the wheel @entity26 chief @entity87 has told critics of his team to work to find a solution some wagging paddock tongues suggest that @entity154 never intended to race here in @entity10			1
the suggestion is that they simply flew over the team and cars and parts to make it seem as if they would			0
why ? they stand to get £ 28million in prize money by fulfilling their obligations to be in attendance , at least			0
( they have missed three races – at the end of last season – and can not miss another under the terms of their contract			2
) @entity154 deny the accusation			0
they say a software problem caused their unavoidable 11th hour withdrawal , adding that they have not saved a penny by not taking part , having bought the fares and paid their staff in any case			0
@entity154 ’s revival , after the team previously known as @entity186 went into administration last autumn , has been widely seen as a tonic for @entity3 , beset by the overspending of the less successful teams ( my interpretation ) , or by the iniquitous way it the sport is run ( the popular narrative )			1
however , it is unsettling that @entity154 , backed by @entity200 entrepreneur @entity199 , are paying just 1.3p in the pound to creditors			0
manor driver @entity203 walks along the grid during the drivers ' parade but did not take part in the race @entity210 waves to supporters before the first race of the season in @entity10 it is no doubt reassuring for @entity154 ’s staff to know that the self - made @entity220 , sporting director of the old @entity186 team and the new @entity219 , is an experienced businessman			2
he made about £ 3.5million when a previous business of which he was a director , the internet group @entity222 , closed amid the global technology crash in the early 2000s			0
also among the lucky few was @entity226 – @entity228 ’s one - time leader in the @entity229 and a close adviser to former @entity98 president @entity231 – who collected £ 400,000 for his £ 1,250 stake			0
investors who bought shares when the company floated , shortly before its shares peaked , did considerably less well			0
one shareholder said at the time of @entity222 ’s closure : ‘ it seems unfair that the directors should be rewarded quite so well for failure			0
’ @entity220 , ceo of @entity154 arrives in the paddock but the team did not start the race in @entity107 imitation being the sincerest form of flattery , it was gratifying to note @entity8 ’s contribution to @entity26 ’ post-qualifying press conference			1
he stood at the back , put his hand up and said to his team boss @entity87 : ‘ from the @entity256 , is there any news on the contract ? ’ @entity87 : ‘ no news on the contract , to the @entity256 journalist			1
’ i am happy to swap salaries with @entity8			1
yet while i do n’t know if he could do my job , i know i could not do his			0
