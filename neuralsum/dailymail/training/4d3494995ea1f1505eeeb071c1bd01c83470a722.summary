by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity4 pensioners gain nearly £ 500 - a - year by @entity4 remaining in the @entity5 , a study has found			2
the report by @entity7 reveals that retired @entity4 receive a better share of pensions and benefits than the rest of the @entity12			1
the former @entity14 prime minister argues that @entity4 gets £ 9.6billion in pensions and old - age benefits annually , which is £ 500million more than the amount it would get if money was divided on the size on of its population			2
a study by @entity7 has revealed that retired @entity4 receive a better share of pensions and benefits than the rest of the @entity12 his intervention comes as a separate report by @entity27 warns that @entity29 ’s proposal for workers to retire earlier in @entity4 than in the rest of the @entity12 was ‘ almost entirely uncosted ’			1
the study by the @entity33 committee also accuses the @entity35 administration of ‘ failing to acknowledge the costs and complexities of disentangling @entity4 claimants from the @entity12 welfare system ’ , and failing to explain how it would pay for shortfalls in public sector pension schemes			2
it will brand the @entity45 ’s pensions policy as the ‘ biggest mis - selling scandal in history ’			0
mr @entity29 and his ministers have vowed to consider raising the state retirement age to 66 in a separate @entity4 , rather than 67 as planned by the @entity50 , because a lower life expectancy means pensioners receive between £ 10,000 and £ 11,000 less on average			1
@entity54 has previously calculated that by 2030 the cost of such a policy would be as much as £ 800million - a - year with as many as 30,000 fewer people in work			0
@entity29 wants @entity4 to retire at 66 because they have a lower life expectancy than those in the rest of the @entity12 @entity45 ministers have also promised a state pension rise linked to whichever is highest - average wages , inflation , or 2.5 per cent			1
this so - called ‘ triple lock ’ will cost no more than the @entity12 @entity50 ’s commitment to increase the state pension in line with earnings , they claim			2
but calculations by a major accountancy firms found that adopting the policy in an independent @entity4 would cost £ 148million in 2019 , rising to £ 272million in 2025			1
@entity4 ’s pensioner population is expected to rise from 1.04million in 2010 to 1.49million in 2066			0
but the working age population is only expected to increase from 3.3million to 3.6million			0
that will create a ‘ dependency ratio ’ of 2.41 workers for every pensioner , compared to 2.64 in other parts of the @entity12			0
mr @entity29 ’s proposed solution is to lift restrictions on @entity84 immigration if he wins the referendum , with net migration levels of 24,000 - a - year – equivalent to a city the size of @entity89 in around 20 years			1
but the committee ’s report states : ‘ migration requires careful management , especially for its effects on public services , such as schools			0
even the highest estimates of likely additional migration which we have seen … would be very challenging indeed to manage ; and yet these levels are still not enough to address the affordability problems in relation to old age pensions which are thrown up by separation			0
