an enormous diorama which shows the full extent of the @entity2 has gone on display to mark the 200th anniversary of the conflict			1
the model contains more than 30,000 figures , and illustrates all the key moments of the battle which allowed the @entity10 to defeat @entity12 's forces			1
it was built in the 1970s , but fell into disrepair before being restored to its former glory just in time for the battle 's bicentenary , which falls on june 18 of this year			1
despite the enormous scale of the diorama , the number of troops featured is just a third of the true number who were killed or wound in the battle - and less than 10 per cent of the total number who took part			1
it is on display at the @entity59 in @entity60 , where it will serve as the centrepiece for the commemoration of the @entity2			2
the diorama was not intended as a snapshot of the battle at any one point , but instead it depicts five different key stages in the progress of the conflict			1
crucial : one of the key moments depicted is the battle for @entity73 , a fortress which was successfully defended by @entity10 melee : the @entity28 forming a square in the face of attacks from @entity12 's troops charge : the @entity82 making an intervention in the battle , whose 200th anniversary is this year indomitable : a farmer successfully defended his vegetable patch even as the battle raged all around him busted : two @entity28 soldiers are depicted trying to sneak off with their regiment 's entire ration of gin the first is the @entity93 , a castle successfully defended by @entity10 , followed by the attempt by @entity96 to attack @entity10 's centre , which was repelled by lieutenant general sir @entity98			1
next is the @entity99 , the @entity101 cavalry offensive that scattered the @entity103 infantry , then the unsuccessful @entity103 cavalry attacks on @entity10 's centre and right flank			2
the final crucial moment depicted is the attack of the @entity109 , @entity12 's last desperate throw of the dice , which led to the guard being forced to retreat for the first time ever			1
both the @entity10 and @entity12 can be found on the model astride their horses directing the battle			1
there is also a grim depiction of @entity121 sir @entity120 meeting his end - being speared by a group of @entity103 lancers			2
@entity124 : major general @entity120 being cut down by a group of @entity103 lancers during the battle onslaught : @entity103 troops trying to break through the gates of @entity73 , as the @entity28 guard the walls help : a wounded soldier being escorted off the battlefield by his wife , who was apparently acting as a camp nurse family : women and children in the back of a cart on the edges of the @entity2 battlefield quagmire : men , carts and horses get stuck in a muddy pit and try to haul their equipment out lighter moments include a @entity150 farmer defending his prized vegetable patch while the battle rages around him , two @entity154 soldiers getting drunk on gin and an infantryman relieving himself against a tree			1
a large @entity103 fighter who was known as ' @entity159 ' can be seen trying to break down an @entity154 barricade with an axe			0
museum curator @entity162 said : ' there are so many vignettes within the diorama			2
' one of my favourites is the gardener at @entity73			0
he and his family meant to escape before the battle but left it too late			0
he is portrayed on the model protecting his cabbages			0
many @entity103 attackers saw him during the battle and laughed at his actions			0
' the 200th anniversary of @entity2 is a landmark commemoration of a decisive victory that brought peace to @entity181 after years of conflict			1
' whilst thousands will be making the trip to @entity150 to participate in and witness re-enactments on the battlefield , we can bring the battlefield to @entity28			0
' late arrival : @entity190 leading the @entity192 troops onto the battlefield , in a decisive intervention repair : the diorama was in a poor condition before being restored ahead of the anniversary spruced up : these images show how the figures were covered in dust before their recent restoration conservation : @entity204 and @entity205 used a vacuum cleaner to help remove the grime which had built up conservationists @entity204 and @entity205 spent five months cleaning the figures on the diorama , and glued back together scores of severed limbs , lost swords and displaced cannonballs			1
mr @entity162 added : ' the diorama was made in the 1970s by @entity215 and acquired by the museum in the 1980s			1
but it never had a top put on it so has got extremely dusty over the years			0
' @entity204 and @entity205 took it apart in 16 sections and took four sections at a time back to their home in @entity224 where they cleaned each individual figure using an air hose and a vacuum cleaner			0
' they have done a fantastic job and it is great to be able to see the incredible detail so clearly			0
' the @entity2 on june 18 , 1815 stopped the advance of @entity12 across @entity181 and sent the great @entity103 emperor into exile for a second and final time			2
@entity103 's troops were defeated by a multi-national coalition , led by the @entity28 army under the command of the @entity10			0
the armies amassed near the town of @entity2 in modern - day @entity150 , not far from the border with @entity103 , and it was the @entity103 who made the first move around 11am			2
the two sides clashed for 10 hours , with the @entity28 fending off repeated attacks from the @entity103 , until @entity190 arrived at the head of a @entity192 army			0
this was the decisive intervention which finished @entity12 off , allowing @entity10 to counter-attack and forcing the @entity103 to surrender			0
the battle forced @entity12 from the throne of @entity103 , leading to his exile on @entity257 - but @entity10 later admitted it was ' the nearest - run thing you ever saw in your life '			2
despite the popular image of @entity2 as a heroic endeavour , it was also the scene of brutal slaughter as thousands of troops were killed , with the @entity103 bearing the brunt of the losses .			0
