forget communism – the biggest threat to @entity2 in 1962 was an alien invasion			2
that ’s what the @entity5 would have you believe , anyway			2
known only to a select few , this top - secret government unit is tasked with investigating a string of mysterious extra-terrestrial attacks			1
their mission is clear – survive , adapt and overcome the alien threat			2
@entity14 : as agent @entity16 , you can use a variety of different weapons but all feel slightly light weight you play agent @entity16 , who spearheads a team of three agents			0
what ’s immediately noticeable is just how many elements @entity5 has borrowed from other successful games			0
take the responsive , cover - based shooting that feels remarkably similar to @entity28			1
or the ‘ @entity34 ’ mode , reminiscent of the skill and command wheel in the @entity33 games			1
both work well , with the latter allowing you to select one of your agents ’ abilities and target specific enemies			0
these range from putting up turrets to healing and providing cover			1
basic commands such as ordering your team to hold position or move to specific points are done via the d - pad			1
another nod to @entity33 is evident in the way @entity5 has interwoven some of @entity55 ’s role - playing elements into levels			1
not only can members of your team die ( and when they ’re dead , they ’re dead ) , but conversations with npcs bring up a dialogue wheel that lets you choose how to respond			0
you answers will then affect the story			0
invasion : at its core , this is another cover - based shooter , but @entity33 - style dialogue wheels help to shape the story			1
sadly , there is no multiplayer - a move that may confuse some @entity55 fans sadly , @entity5 feels like it 's suffering from an identity crisis			1
the preview levels felt linear with little environmental interaction while it remains to be seen if there is enough narrative depth to stop the dynamic conversations feeling tacked on			0
firing the guns – be that alien or human – lacked punch , too			0
part of @entity28 's appeal was just how connected you felt to the weapons , and how different each one felt			2
in @entity5 , even the most powerful - looking ray gun felt like you were wielding a waterpistol			2
the most shocking omission , though , comes in the lack of any sort of mutliplayer - especially as the team - based nature of the @entity97 's core gameplay would lend itself to co-operative modes			1
graphically , the demo build was played on a pc and uses the @entity101			2
it holds up well , and some parts – for example when alien structures burst out of a residential street – are effective			0
but this is an engine that has been used in hundreds of games and its wow factor has diminished			0
seen this before ? the @entity34 is very similar to @entity33 's on - the - fly battle command system the @entity5 ’s narrative will determine whether this is a worthy entry into the @entity55 universe , or one that @entity116 will want to sweep under the carpet and deny all knowledge of its existence			1
the @entity5 : @entity121 is set for release on august 23			0
let us know what you think on @entity126 : @ @entity127 and on @entity128 : @entity129 .			0

blend of cover - based shooting and role playing
responsive controls and easy - to - use @entity34 *mechanic*
lacks multiplayer and off - line cooperative modes which may narrow appeal
nothing *jaw* - dropping about the *visuals* - even when running on pc
