by @entity0 a blaze on a @entity4 plane which caused widespread disruption at @entity6 last week has been linked to a lithium battery in its emergency beacon , air accident investigators have revealed			1
the @entity10 's @entity9 ( @entity9 ) said the plane ’s emergency locator transmitter ( @entity13 ) caught fire and had shown indications of disruption to the battery cells which ‘ could provide the energy for an ignition ’			1
the @entity13 is an emergency beacon used to give emergency services and authorities an accurate location for a plane following a crash			1
the new investigators ’ report notes that the emergency beacon in the stricken aircraft contained a set of lithium - manganese dioxide - based chemical batteries which allow it to operate in an emergency			1
it said : ‘ detailed examination of the @entity13 has shown some indications of disruption to the battery cells			1
‘ it is not clear however , whether the combustion in the area of the @entity13 was initiated by a release of energy within the batteries or by an external mechanism such as an electrical short			1
’ the @entity13 ( @entity13 ) is an emergency beacon used to give emergency services and authorities an accurate location for a plane following a crash			1
the beacons , made by @entity32 conglomerate @entity31 , are positioned in the upper rear part of the advanced jets , and send a signal that leads rescuers to downed aircraft			0
@entity9 said @entity31 had produced some 6,000 @entity85 of the same design , which are fitted to a wide range of aircraft			0
they are powered by non-rechargeable , lithium - manganese batteries			0
@entity9 's report said aviation regulators should conduct a safety review of lithium - powered emergency locator beacons in all aircraft types			1
the @entity13 history indicated the event was rare , and the fire happened while the aircraft was unoccupied , it said			1
@entity4 said it supported the @entity9 's recommendations and reiterated its confidence in the @entity4 's safety			2
it said it stood by the plane 's ' overall integrity '			0
the @entity9 recommended that the @entity106 ensure the power was turned off in all @entity31 - made @entity13 systems in the 60 - plus @entity109 currently in commercial service			2
a source close to the probe said this could mean removing the @entity13 's batteries			2
@entity31 said it did not expect any financial impact from the incident			0
the battery linked to the @entity118 fire is made by @entity120 - based @entity119 , according to an industry source			2
@entity119 did not return calls or emails seeking comment			0
but it stresses : ‘ in the case of an electrical short , the same batteries could provide the energy for an ignition and suffer damage in the subsequent fire			2
’ the @entity9 today called on the @entity106 ( @entity106 ) to begin efforts to make the @entity13 ‘ inert ’ on all 787 aircraft until the safety of the device can be explored further			1
thousands of passengers faced travel chaos last friday after the aircraft , which has been plagued with problems since its launch , caught fire while on a remote parking stand shortly after 4.30pm			1
nobody was on board the @entity146 - operated plane at the time of the incident and there were no injuries			0
runways were closed to all flights for an hour and a half while emergency crews dealt with the blaze , which caused diversions and long delays for passengers			0
the @entity9 investigation said : ‘ the history of this @entity13 product line indicated that a thermal event is extremely rare			2
‘ however , large transport aircraft do not typically carry the means of fire detection or suppression in the space above the cabin ceilings and had this event occurred in - flight , it could pose a significant safety concern and raise challenges for the cabin crew in tackling the resulting fire			2
’ the report said investigations would continue into what triggered the fire in the emergency beacon			2
investigators said @entity32 aerospace part manufacturer @entity31 , which built the @entity13 , had been invited to join their probe into the incident			2
another different battery problem earlier this year led to delivery delays which caused @entity184 to scrap plans to use the ultra-green aircraft in may and june			0
the carrier finally began dreamliner services earlier this month			0
continuous production difficulties had already plagued the @entity4			0
it should have entered passenger service in 2008 but it was not until october 2011 that the first commercial flight was operated by @entity194 carrier @entity193			0
@entity195 has taken delivery of the first of its 24 @entity198 , while @entity200 is due to receive the first of its 16 @entity109 in september next year			0
investigators also called on the @entity106 to conduct a safety review of installations of similar lithium - powered elts in other aircraft			0
in a statement , @entity4 described the recommendation for the beacons to be immobilised as ‘ a precautionary measure ’ adding : ‘ the safety of passengers and crew members who fly aboard @entity4 airplanes is our highest priority			1
thousands of passengers faced travel chaos last friday after the aircraft , which has been plagued with problems since its launch , caught fire while on a remote parking stand shortly after 4.30pm july 28 2012 : a fan shaft fails during runway tests in @entity226 december 2012 : a @entity4 was forced to make an emergency landing in @entity228 january 7 2013 : an unoccupied dreamliner flight bursts into flames at @entity232 airport january 15 2013 : a flight made an emergency landing in @entity194 after a smoke alarm went off			1
the string of incidents led to regulators ordering a global grounding of the entire @entity4 fleet , which lasted for four months june 2 2013 : battery – related problems were reported on a @entity244 aircraft forcing the airline to use an alternative plane june 12 2013 : a flight in @entity194 was cancelled after one of the engines failed to start june 18 2013 : a @entity251 flight was diverted to @entity252 due to an oil - filter problem june 24 2013 : a @entity4 operated by @entity251 had to make an emergency landing in @entity255 due to a brake problem july 3 2013 : @entity258 airline lot cancelled a @entity4 flight to @entity260 because the aircraft had ‘ problems with the power supply ’ ‘ we are working proactively to support the regulatory authorities in taking appropriate action in response to these recommendations , in co-ordination with our customers , suppliers , and other commercial airplane manufacturers			1
' we are confident the 787 is safe and we stand behind its overall integrity			0
’ @entity4 ’s revolutionary ‘ plastic plane ’ was grounded globally in january after safety watchdogs in @entity277 , the @entity32 and @entity275 warned that its leaky back - up electric batteries could cause it to catch fire			1
flight safety officials banned @entity283 ’s flagship @entity4 from taking off amid fears the faulty lithium - type batteries , which are also used in electric cars and laptops , could start fires on board			1
the @entity4 is the first airliner to make extensive use of lithium - ion batteries to help power its energy - hungry electrical systems			2
the batteries charge faster and can be better moulded to space - saving shapes compared with other aeroplane batteries			0
but the electrolyte fluid also conducts electricity , so as it spreads it can cause short - circuits and ignite fires			0
its corrosiveness also raised concern about whether a leak might weaken a key support structure of the plane			0
it is dubbed the ‘ plastic plane ’ because its fuselage is ‘ spun ’ from super-strong but lightweight carbon fibre , which cuts weight and fuel consumption , rather than constructed from aluminium @entity9 said that the beacon in such planes should be switched off , spurring a rally in shares from relieved investors			1
circled , the location of the @entity13 @entity9 said that the beacon in such planes should be switched off , spurring a rally in shares from relieved investors			2
@entity4 said the beacon could be removed in about an hour from its newest model plane , which was grounded for more than three months earlier this year due to a battery issue that regulators said was unrelated to the fire on an @entity146 jet			1
the @entity32 @entity106 regulations do not require the transmitter , but some other nations do , the plane maker said in a statement backing the @entity10 report			1
a @entity277 regulatory official said the jets could fly with the locator beacons temporarily de-activated , despite regulations mandating them in most commercial situations			0
analysts cautioned that the @entity10 report still left open the question of how the fire actually started			2
' this is not really what you call a conclusive answer , ' said @entity344 , an aviation consultant with the @entity345			0
' there 's nothing about this finding that indicates a lack of safety with the plane , but on the other hand there 's no conclusive proof that a system unrelated to the plane is to blame			0
shares in @entity4 rose 2.6 percent to $ 107.40 , closing in on the all - time high of $ 108.15 , set just before the fire was reported			1
@entity360 , a @entity32 - based analyst and consultant with close ties to industry , said the @entity10 recommendation did not call into question the airworthiness of the 787 , which offered some good news for @entity4			1
' the @entity31 device is simply a beacon for locating the aircraft in an accident , so it has no bearing on the flight worthiness of the plane , ' @entity360 said			0
despite early concerns about the composite nature of the plane , high - tech electronics were turning out to be a bigger headache for the @entity4 , @entity360 said			1
@entity31 shares were trading 72 cents higher at $ 83.17 around midday , near a year - high , while shares in @entity119 were up 1 cent from wednesday 's close of $ 3.82 .			0
