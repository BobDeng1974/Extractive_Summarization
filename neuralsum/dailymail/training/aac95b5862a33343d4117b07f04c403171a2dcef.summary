insider : @entity2 family heir @entity1 , pictured , has revealed the juicy details of growing up within @entity7 - the prominent clan 's 43 - room @entity5 manor an @entity9 heir has revealed the juicy details of growing up within @entity7 - the prominent clan 's 43 - room @entity5 manor - and it was more grumbling tummies than gold - plated china			1
many assumed the @entity18 family , the 10th generation of @entity2 heirs , were eccentric hippies living off trust funds but , according to a fascinating new memoir by one of its own , the money had run out			1
' i lived a double life , ' @entity1 says			1
' our poverty was the big secret			1
' @entity2 married into the 420 - acre estate in 1818			1
but , by the time @entity18 was running down its hallways , she says ' the @entity2 money that had supported generations of aristocrats , ill - equipped to earn or invest , ( was ) gone			1
' the front of the house was a facade , where @entity18 's uncle told tours of people a spiel about the @entity9 's 200 - year history			1
but , behind the scenes , the home was crumbling			0
@entity18 and her parents shared three cramped rooms on the third floor			1
' i always longed to be rescued , ' @entity18 , whose book ' the @entity51 ' is released on tuesday , told the @entity53			2
she described how she envied the ' simple ranch , prefab houses ' of the middle class			0
' i wanted to live like them , ' she says			0
the home she grew up in , built in 1815 , was added to by every new owner and came to represent the classic ' @entity62 style			0
' her ancestor @entity2 became ' the richest man in @entity66 ' with his successful trading of products such as furs , pianos and real estate			1
ironic : the massive home she grew up in came to typify the @entity74 , but @entity18 says she came to envy middle class homes the next generation divided into city and country @entity80 - the @entity78 line prospered but the country side of the clan did not fare so well			1
@entity86 's oldest daughter , @entity85 , passed away in childbirth and her daughter , @entity88 , died of pneumonia at an early age			0
when her husband died two years later , their eight children , aged four to 14 , became the ' @entity2 orphans			2
' among them were ' @entity96 , ' ' @entity97 ' and ' @entity98			0
' ' these free - spirited @entity2 orphans left us , their descendents , our legacy : the house , its history , and contents , and a sense of entitlement and superiority , ' @entity18 writes in the memoir , according to @entity110			1
memoir : @entity112 by @entity1 tells of life inside the family 's @entity5 mansion but after @entity88 's death in 1963 @entity117 began to decline and through the 1980s , when @entity18 was a young girl , the estate continued to fall into ruin , partly because it was owned jointly by three decedents			1
' joint ownership brought out the worst in everyone , ' @entity18 says			2
' everyone had different views of what should happen to @entity117			0
' it also suffered without the 25 - strong staff it once had dedicated to its upkeep			2
@entity18 told @entity110 the house was divided with where you lived reflecting your status			1
her uncle and his family lived in a spacious apartment on the first floor while she , her father @entity140 , and his @entity142 artist wife were banished to the servant 's quarters			2
she says ' the lonely squalor of the third floor ' was startlingly contrasted to the grandeur of the rest of the property and she ' felt ashamed each time i climbed the stairs			0
' @entity153 : @entity86 , pictured , married into the 420 - acre estate in 1818 and made his fortune selling fur and real estate often they did n't have the cash to buy food and bartered with neighbors to survive , she revealed			1
' i enjoyed keeping the myth alive that i lived in a mansion , ' @entity18 says			2
' i did nâ€™t want to bring anyone home and show them that i really live on the third floor and the front of the house is a museum			0
' after boarding school , she moved to @entity142 then returned to @entity175 in 1998 where she converted to @entity178 and she and her husband had a son , @entity180			0
but in 2005 , she and her son returned to her ancestral home and lived there for six years			2
she says it remains ' dirty and rundown ' to outsiders but has drastically improved since she was a young girl			0
her father , now in his 70s , still lives in an 18 - by - 11 - foot room that has n't changed a bit , according to @entity110			0
but she says , whatever it 's condition , her family will never sell the grandiose property			0
' it 's part of our identities , part of who we are			0
