by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 09:05 est , 8 april 2013 updated : 10:04 est , 8 april 2013 airline complaints surged 20percent last year as grumpy airline passengers complained about being squeezed into smaller seats and flights that are becoming even more packed			2
an independent review of airlines by researchers at @entity10 and @entity11 universities found that @entity12 offered the worst service to passengers of all @entity16 carriers			1
@entity17 had the happiest fliers in 2012 , according to the @entity19 , which measures @entity20 figures for on - time rates , overbooking , mishandled bags and consumer complaints			1
still , researchers found that , overall , airlines appear to be doing a better job , recording fewer late flights , fewer over-bookings and fewer mishandled bags			1
cramped : passengers are complaining more as airlines make seats smaller and pack more passengers onto flights in an effort to maximize profits but , that does n't mean passengers are are less grumpy			0
' the way airlines have taken 130 - seat airplanes and expanded them to 150 seats to squeeze out more revenue i think is finally catching up with them , ' said @entity46 , a business professor at @entity10 who has co-written the annual report for 23 years			2
' people are saying , " look , i do n't fit here			0
" at some point airlines ca n't keep shrinking seats to put more people into the same tube , ' he said			0
for the first time since 2007 , the overall airline industry rating dropped from the previous year			2
fliers lodged more than 11,400 formal complaints last year , compared to 9,400 in 2011			2
@entity12 had the highest rate of complaints - with 4.24 for every 100,00 passengers			1
that rate is nearly two and a half times higher than the next - most - complained - about airline , @entity16			2
worst : @entity12 had the worst airline quality rating in the country , including the most complaints in 2012 best : the relatively - new @entity17 offered the best service , according to @entity20 statistics analyzed by researchers the @entity71 , produced each year by researchers at @entity10 and @entity11 universities ranks the nation 's airlines based on @entity20 statistics			1
the report takes into account on - time rate , mishandled baggage reports , over-booking and complaints filed			1
the industry average rating got worse this year for the first time since 2007			2
( ranking is from best rating to worst ) ' they 're just fed up			2
they ’re fed up to the point that they are willing to make complaints to the @entity20 , ' @entity11 professor @entity87 , the co-author of the report , told @entity93			2
' they try complaining to the airlines , but the airlines do n’t care , they ’re not responsive and they do n’t change			0
' professor @entity87 said @entity12 fared so poorly because 2012 was the first year @entity12 and @entity98 were operating as an integrated airline after their 2010 merger			1
consumer satisfaction usually declines dramatically after a merger			2
' when you take two mediocre airlines and you put them together , you get one bad one , ' @entity87 said of the merger			0
he noted that @entity107 - rated the best of the major air carriers this year - has only just recovered after its 2008 merger with @entity111			2
the dependency was smaller when it came to being on time			2
@entity114 performed best at sticking to time schedules in 2012 , while @entity117 's @entity116 and @entity119 's @entity118 were the worst , according to the study			0
@entity114 , owned by @entity114 , had the best on - time performance last year , at 93.4 percent			1
the two worst performers were at 76.9 percent			0
customer complaints per 100,000 passengers increased from 1.19 in 2011 to 1.43 in 2012 , according to the study , a joint project funded as part of faculty research activities at @entity10 and @entity11 universities			1
the industry is even looking at ways to make today 's smaller - than - a - broom closet toilets more compact in the hope of squeezing a few more seats onto planes			0
' i ca n't imagine the uproar that making toilets smaller might generate , ' @entity46 said , especially given that passengers increasingly weigh more than they use to			0
nevertheless , ' will it keep them from flying ? i doubt it would			0
' in recent years , some airlines have shifted to larger planes that can carry more people , but that has n't been enough to make up for an overall reduction in flights			0
punctual : @entity114 had the best on - time rating in 2012 , with 93.4percent of flights sticking to schedule the rate at which passengers with tickets were denied seats because planes were full rose to 0.97 denials per 10,000 passengers last year , compared with 0.78 in 2011			1
it used to be in cases of overbookings that airlines usually could find a passenger who would volunteer to give up a seat in exchange for cash , a free ticket or some other compensation with the expectation of catching another flight later that day or the next morning			0
' since flights are so full , there are no seats on those next flights			0
so people say , " no , not for $ 500 , not for $ 1,000 , " ' said airline industry analyst @entity179 regional carrier @entity117 had the highest involuntary denied boardings rate last year , 2.32 per 10,000 passengers			0
but not every airline overbooks flights in an effort to keep seats full			0
@entity186 and @entity17 were the industry leaders in avoiding denied boardings , with rates of 0.01 and 0.07 , respectively			1
@entity12 had the highest consumer complaint rate of the 14 airlines included in the report , with 4.24 complaints per 100,000 passengers			1
that was nearly double the airline 's complaint rate the previous year			0
@entity197 had the lowest rate , at 0.25			0
consumer complaints were significantly higher in the peak summer travel months of june , july and august when planes are especially crowded			1
' as airplanes get fuller , complaints get higher because people just do n't like to be sardines , ' @entity179 said			0
word of warning : @entity118 is poised to merge with @entity209 and the new airline is in danger of losing its customer satisfaction - if other airline mergers is any guide , researchers say the complaints are regarded as indicators of a larger problem because many passengers may not realize they can file complaints with @entity20 , which regulates airlines			1
at the same time complaints were increasing , airlines were doing a better job of getting passengers to their destinations on time			1
the industry average for on - time arrival rate was 81.8 percent of flights , compared with 80 percent in 2011			1
@entity114 had the best on - time performance record , 93.4 percent in 2012			1
@entity116 and @entity118 had the worst records with only 76.9 percent of their planes arriving on time last year			0
the industry 's on - time performance has improved in recent years , partly due to airlines ' decision to cut back on the number of flights			1
' we 've shown over the 20 years of doing this that whenever the system is n't taxed as much - fewer flights , fewer people , less bags - it performs better			1
it 's when it reaches a critical mass that it starts to fracture , ' @entity46 said			0
the industry 's shift to charging for fees for extra bags , or sometimes charging fees for any bags , has significantly reduced the rate of lost or mishandled bags			1
passengers are checking fewer bags than before , and carrying more bags onto planes when permitted			0
the industry 's mishandled bag rate peaked in 2007 at 7.01 mishandled bags per 1,000 passengers			1
it was 3.07 in 2012 , down from 3.35 bags the previous year			0
the report 's ratings are based on statistics kept by the department for airlines that carry at least 1 percent of the passengers who flew domestically last year			2
the airlines covered in the report are @entity278 , @entity279 , @entity16 , @entity280 , @entity107 , @entity116 , @entity281 , @entity114 , @entity186 , @entity117 , @entity197 , @entity12 , @entity209 and @entity17			1
the research is sponsored by @entity11 in @entity283 , and by @entity10 in @entity284 .			0
