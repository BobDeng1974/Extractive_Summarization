a council is to include the title ' @entity2 ' on its official forms to be more accommodating to the trans - community			1
campaigners say that ' @entity2 ' , short for ' @entity6 ' , is a gender neutral alternative to @entity8 , mrs , ms and @entity11 @entity12 and @entity15 city council 's trans - equality panel previously pointed out that the gender part of forms allows people to say if they are male , female or other			1
it said the lack of options in the title field does not provide for people who do not identify as male or female			2
@entity12 and @entity15 city council is to offer ' @entity2 ' as a title option on official forms following a review of services for trans people yesterday the council 's policy and resources committee approved a series of measures , including the removal of the need for patients to choose from male or female options when they check in at electronic screens on arrival at a gp surgery			1
other recommendations include ensuring all councillors and police staff undertake trans awareness training and introducing gender neutral toilets and changing rooms , suggested by the council 's trans - equality scrutiny panel			1
@entity12 has a gay , lesbian , bisexual and trans population of about 40,000			0
the recommendations will now be passed on to the full council			0
@entity54 , 79 , of @entity55 , @entity56 , who was born male , said : ' it can be difficult in gp surgeries - i am not recognised			0
' if i put in female i am not found if i put in male - which i am not - i am not found			0
' you have to decide between one sex or the other depending on what stage of your transition you are at			0
' and in some situations , for example , when you are getting your bins collected , does it matter if you are male or female ? ' the recommendation follows the suggestions from @entity12 and @entity15 city council to introduce gender neutral toilets and send councillors and police to trans awareness training the report noted : ' the @entity81 was ground - breaking , being the first in the country to carry out , in a sensitive and effective way , a detailed investigation into the experiences and needs of trans individuals and community in the city			1
' it provides a firm and clear foundation for all public services to build on in terms of improving their understanding of and service provision to the trans community			2
' for example , during the panel process housing officers committed to commissioning trans awareness training and city services committed looking at the introducing more flexibility on honorific titles ( such as @entity8 , ms ) within online forms			2
' the clinical commissioning group made up of gps across the county said it would implement the changes			0

' there has been inadequate awareness of lives of trans people for too long			1
' the recommendations of our cross party panel will make the city a fairer place for trans people to live , work , study or visit here			1
