by @entity0 spilling secrets : former @entity3 acting general counsel @entity2 wrote a book about his 33 years at the agency a new book by one of the @entity3 ’s top lawyers has exposed decades - old secrets of the nation ’s spy agency , telling his unfiltered thoughts on various presidents , the controversial waterboarding tapes and their back - door deals with @entity17 stars who wanted to trade secrets for cocaine			1
@entity2 became publicly well known in 2007 when the @entity21 administration nominated him to be the general counsel of the @entity3 , but his nomination was blocked because of his approval of waterboarding			1
much of his book , @entity27 : thirty years of @entity28 in the @entity3 , tells the previously - guarded tales of clandestine operations including their frequent partnerships with @entity17 stars			1
in the book , read by @entity35 , the connection between the @entity3 and the movie business was recently publicized by the film @entity36 , but mr @entity2 ’s book shows that their partnerships were more than just some creative storyboards and false movie advertisements			1
' these are people who have made a lot of money basically creating make - believe stuff , ' mr @entity2 wrote , explaining why actors worked as perfect covers for intelligence operations			1
' their power and international celebrity can be valuable — it gives them entrée to people and places abroad			0
heads of state want to meet and get cozy with them			0
their film crews are given free rein everywhere , even in places where the @entity58 government does n’t normally have it			0
’ hot topic : @entity2 's book , @entity27 , opens with a discussion of his controversial handling of the video recordings of terror suspect @entity65 ( left ) being waterboarded he did n’t name any specific names , but he recalled how one star who at first proclaimed to volunteer based on purely patriotic reasons actually had a different idea of how he should be rewarded for his help			2
mr @entity2 recalled an interesting conversation with the @entity3 employee who was the handler for this particular actor : ‘ the actor refuses to take any money , but he told us that instead all he wants is for us to score him the best fifty - thousand - dollar stash of cocaine we can find			1
he seems to think we can get the real primo stuff			0
so that ’s why i ’m here			0
is it okay for us to do it ? ’ he recalled the unidentified agent asking			0
mr @entity2 shot down the request and said that the actor ended up helping the agency free of charge			0
some of the more politically - loaded anecdotes that mr @entity2 included about the commanders - in - chief who were in charge during his time at the @entity3 , which he joined in 1976			2
he repeatedly slammed president @entity93 and said that after he was elected ‘ it was increasingly apparent that president @entity93 could n’t care less about the @entity3 or the rest of the intelligence community ’			1
' could n't care less ' : @entity2 slammed president @entity93 , saying that he ' was n't interested in , did n't care about , the @entity3 at all ' and gave them the worst snub that by sending @entity98 to an agent 's funeral in his place not a fan : breaking his own rule of always voting for an incumbent president or party successor , mr @entity2 opted not to vote for @entity106 in 2008 because he had ' serious pause about his temperament ' ‘ ( @entity93 ) was n’t interested in , did n’t care about , the @entity3 at all			1
for an organization whose relevance and impact is so utterly dependent on its relationship with the commander in chief , being ignored is even worse than being mistrusted , ’ he wrote			0
his most damning critique came when he told how the @entity116 president sent then - first lady @entity98 to attend the funeral for a fallen operative in his place			1
mr @entity2 called the move ‘ the most hurtful presidential snub i witnessed in my entire career ’			2
‘ @entity93 , our new president , could n’t find the time to make the ten - minute trip from the @entity126 to the @entity3 to pay his respects			1
he sent his wife instead			0
it was an unforgivable slight from a man who had famously told the @entity58 people during his just - completed campaign , “ i feel your pain , ” ’ mr @entity2 wrote			2
his appears to have taken the most personal slight from @entity93 but did not pass that along to the rest of his administration			0
‘ unlike @entity93 , @entity138 had always seemed to be a sophisticated , engaged , and supportive patron of the @entity3 ...			1
@entity21 , on the other hand , was a governor with zero experience in intelligence matters , ’ he wrote			2
in spite of his clear problems with president @entity93 , that did n’t stop him from voting for him in his re-election as he admits to always voting for an incumbent president or their successor			2
the only exception to this rule was the 2008 election when he opted to vote for @entity154 over @entity106 to follow president @entity21 ’s two terms , and he wrote ‘ what i had heard and personally observed about @entity106 gave me serious pause about his temperament ’			1
positive temperament : former @entity3 directors @entity162 ( left ) and @entity163 ( right ) were both praised for their approachable and comfortable manners in dealing with their inferiors mr @entity2 clearly has interesting views on the various presidents , but his insights were even more detailed when it came to their appointments of @entity3 directors			2
he called @entity162 , the director appointed by president @entity93 who served through a portion of president @entity21 ’s term as well , ‘ the most “ regular guy ” ’ director during his tenure and praised his easy and comfortable approach with staff			1
‘ he often shambled into meetings in the hallowed director ’s conference room with tie askew , sometimes in his stocking feet , gnawing away on an unlit @entity186 cigar from the stash he had accumulated courtesy of visiting heads of foreign intelligence services , ’ mr @entity2 wrote			0
he gave a similarly - positive review of @entity163 , who was appointed by president @entity154			0
‘ for his part , ( @entity163 ) looked every bit as @entity194 as his name , but it was more the way he came across — sunny , earthy , without a shred of formality or phoniness — that reminded me of my late father and all of his brothers who had been the products , like @entity163 , of a first - generation @entity194 @entity58 family , ’ mr @entity2 wrote			0
‘ he loved to laugh and joke , as did i , and we were forming an easy , bantering relationship			0
’ the book was released on tuesday , coming out just days before the controversial tell - all written by former secretary of state @entity211 who slammed his former commander , president @entity154			0
mr @entity2 left the @entity3 in 2009 , making his five year break between being in office and publishing his book significantly longer than year - and - a - half that mr @entity211 ’ waited , but mr @entity2 implies that it is something of an inevitability that all secrets will end up coming out eventually			1
‘ if all my years and experience at the @entity3 taught me anything , it ’s that virtually every secret does n’t stay secret forever , and that the shelf life of new secrets is getting shorter all the time , ’ he wrote .			2
