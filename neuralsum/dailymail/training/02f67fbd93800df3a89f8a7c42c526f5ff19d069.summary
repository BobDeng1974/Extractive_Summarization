@entity7 , in @entity8 , @entity9 ( pictured ) , closed with just a few hours ' notice on thursday because nine members of staff called in sick			1
the school has said it will not re-open until wednesday at the earliest the school , which last year lost £ 1.1million after falling for a simple email scam , closed to all but its @entity28 and @entity29 pupils because of the shortages , forcing disgruntled parents to arrange last - minute childcare			1
a text message was sent to parents at 9.45pm last thursday warning them of the following day 's closure			1
yesterday , parents were told the school - which caters for 469 pupils aged 11 to 19 - would not reopen to students until wednesday at the earliest			1
it also emerged that several year 11 students who did turn up on friday were sent home because they were n't wearing school uniform			2
a spokesman for school sponsor the @entity44 said it had taken the decision to shut the school after ' exhausting all other options '			1
the spokesman added that the @entity44 was merely an interim sponsor of the school until a new , permanent sponsor came forward			2
he said : ' at present , nine staff are absent due to illness			1
we are working hard , with the support of the @entity58 to recruit supply teachers to ensure the school reopens fully			2
' our primary concern has always been the welfare and attainment of students at the @entity7 , and we remain committed to working with any future permanent sponsor to ensure as smooth a transition as possible			1
' however , parents slammed the academy 's administration at an emergency meeting organised by residents ' group @entity71			1
@entity73 , whose 15 - year - old daughter @entity74 attends the school , said : ' i think it 's disgusting			2
it 's @entity79 's gcse year and she is willing to knuckle down and study but gets to school and there are no teachers			0
' there has been lots of empty promises and meetings but they 've all come to nothing			0
it 's so frustrating because it 's totally out of my hands			0
i ca n't send her to a different school because it 's her last year			0
' @entity93 , mp for @entity94 ( right ) , joined furious parents at a hastily - arranged meeting in which they slammed the academy 's administration and its decision to close the school over teacher sickness the school , which is one of the worst performing in the country and faces calls for permanent closure , said it had been forced to close after ' exhausting all other options '			1
pictured above : interim principal @entity109 parents have also taken to message boards to vent their anger and frustration at the school , which is one of the worst - performing in the country			1
@entity118 said : ' this is unbelievable , this school is failing all its pupils			0
' @entity122 wrote : ' have some clever students hacked this account lol - surely they ca n't have that many staff off sick ! ' and @entity126 added : ' the school is so unorganised ( sic ) , they need to sort themselves out and start doing some teaching			1
' a letter to parents from @entity131 , spokesman for the @entity44 , which was sent yesterday , said : ' i regret to inform you that , as a number of staff remain absent due to illness , years 7 - 10 at @entity7 will remain closed on monday 9 february and tuesday 10 february			1
' @entity28 and the @entity29 will remain open as normal			0
' i apologise for the inconvenience this will undoubtedly cause many of you			0
it is a decision we have only taken after exhausting all other options			1
' we will review the state of play on tuesday and i will write to you early on the afternoon of tuesday 10 february to keep you informed of further developments			0

' the school was one of the first in the country to be given academy status in 2012 by former education secretary @entity161			0
however , it is now facing permanent closure following a string of setbacks			0
it was first was put into special measures in 2000 when it was known as @entity7			1
inspectors warned it to improve in 2008 following an unsatisfactory report and in 2011 it recorded the country 's worst gcse results , with just three per cent of students scoring the bench - mark five a * - @entity176 grades including @entity178 and maths			0
the school improved its scores in 2012 and 2013 but it was put into special measures in december last year after inspectors gave it the lowest possible rating			0
they said performance at the school had ' declined substantially since the previous inspection ' and slammed staff for teaching up to five different lessons in the same classroom at the same time			1
last year the school sensationally lost £ 1.1million when finance staff fell for an email scam asking for details of its bank account			1
the staff sent the details without questioning the email , allowing the con - artist to withdraw money from the account			1
@entity204 was a co-sponsor of the school alongside the @entity44 but pulled out in june last year			0
@entity93 , mp for @entity94 , has now called for new governors to be installed at the school in a desperate bid to turn it around - but said closing the school permanently must be considered			0
he said : ' we need ground zero now			0
we must step right back and refocus on the situation			0
every option has got to be on the table , whether it 's closure , splitting the campus so @entity218 's becomes a studio school or bringing in a new sponsor			0
' there is no difference in my judgement between the calibre and talent of the students who go into the @entity228 and those who go into @entity218 's			0
something is fundamentally , unacceptably wrong there			0
' what we need is a new governing body , because the old governing body are inextricably linked to the previous failure , and a new sponsor who is absolutely committed to the academy and it just needs to happen quickly			0
' a @entity58 spokesman said : ' we are aware that the @entity44 has temporarily closed @entity7			1
' the regional schools commissioner is working closely with the school and its sponsor to ensure that an appropriate plan is in place so that pupils ' education can resume as soon as possible			0
' dame @entity247 , who is now a government adviser , rewarded teachers who took no sick days by giving them bottles of wine and book tokens a former headteacher cracked down on the number of sick days taken by staff at her school by offering them bottles of wine and book tokens for good attendance			2
dame @entity247 , who is now a government adviser , rewarded teachers who took no sick days by giving them incentives as part of her crackdown on recurrent absences			0
while working at @entity266 , in @entity267 , west @entity268 , she also cut a third of the teaching staff and vowed to cut the £ 150,000 - a - year bill for supply teachers – who were drafted in to cover sick days			2
prior to her taking over running of the school , staff had been told to ring a dedicated ' cover phone ' if they were going to be off sick			2
however , @entity280 immediately pulled the plug on the phone and advised all staff they would have to phone the senior vice-principal before 7am if they planned to have the day off ill. she said it allowed her to overhear their reasons for being off ill , and clamped down after hearing some of the excuses			2
she told @entity292 : ' i would hear him [ senior vice-principal ] negotiating with staff			2
often he would ask just how sick they were			0
' how severe a headache ? have you taken a paracetamol ? ca n't your boiler be fixed at the weekend ? why do n't you bring your child to school ? ' a particular stand - out favourite of mine was : ' what do you mean your cat 's hurt her paw ? ' as part of her overhaul at the school , @entity280 also refurbished the toilets , enlisted plants in the corridors , started punishing pupils who arrived late , installed table tennis tables in the playground and fitted doorstops in every classroom so doors could always be kept open			0
@entity280 , who also arrived at the school at 6am every morning during her time as headteacher , was praised with transforming the comprehensive grammar school from ' feral and toxic ' to a success			2
