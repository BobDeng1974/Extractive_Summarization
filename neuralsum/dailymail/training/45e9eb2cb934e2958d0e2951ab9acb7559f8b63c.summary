no go : lifeguards have issued a warning after this tunnel appeared at @entity11 the @entity18 ( @entity18 ) has warned holidaymakers not to dig into dunes anywhere along the @entity2 coast this summer – as they can be death traps			1
changing weather and damage done to dunes over the winter make them unstable			2
‘ many sand dunes have altered dramatically over the last 12 months due to the winter storms , ’ a spokesman for the @entity18 says			1
‘ in hot weather the sand dries , creating an increased risk of collapse which could bury people alive			0
’ @entity18 lifeguards discovered the latest tunnel , at @entity11 , earlier this month			1
although it was empty , a backpack had been left inside it			0
the tunnel was roughly 7ft deep and just over 3ft high – meaning that children could easily have crawled inside			0
lifeguards quickly filled the hole using shovels to prevent anybody from getting trapped			0
the @entity18 has produced a new poster warning people to take extra care			1
@entity48 , @entity18 senior lifeguard manager , thinks the tunnel is a worrying sign			2
‘ this is the first sand tunnel we 've seen this year , and fortunately the lifeguards spotted it and were able to cover it over quickly , ’ he says			0
‘ clearly it could have collapsed at any time whilst digging it , or even whilst walking over it , with potentially fatal consequences			0
‘ although the large cliffs of sand may look enticing playgrounds , we urge people to resist the temptation to play on them or dig into them			0
family favourite : @entity11 is one of @entity13 's most popular beaches ‘ the sand is very unstable and can collapse at any time , trapping anyone on or below it			1
‘ the areas of unstable dunes and cliffs are clearly signed on the beaches , and we ask people to take heed of this advice – as it 's in their best interests for their safety			2
’ @entity18 lifeguards began their peak season patrols last saturday , meaning that all 57 life - guarded beaches in @entity13 will be patrolled , with lifeguard numbers increasing on some of the busier beaches			1
peak season runs until 7 september , and is predicted to be the busiest time for @entity18 lifesavers as it takes in the school summer holidays			2
the @entity18 says that anybody visiting the coast should visit an @entity18 life - guarded beach and swim only between the red and yellow flags , which marks out the safest bathing area .			1
