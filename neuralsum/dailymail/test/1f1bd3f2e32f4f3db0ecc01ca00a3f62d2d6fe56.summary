eight months later when @entity3 was admitted to hospital to have his colostomy removed he nearly lost his life to a dangerous flesh - eating virus			1
it perforated his bowel and ate tissue from his chest cavity			0
' he had his colostomy when he was one - day - old so we had to wait until he was much older and bigger to have it removed , ' ms @entity5 told @entity33			1
she was forced to deliver her twins via caesarean 10 weeks early after he water broke at 30 weeks eight months later when @entity3 was admitted to hospital to have his colostomy removed he nearly lost his life to a dangerous flesh - eating virus after the surgery , @entity3 ( pictured with his parents ) - who was eight months at the time - started going down hill pretty quickly about a month ago , @entity3 - who was eight months old - was admitted to @entity41 in @entity42 to have his colostomy removed , in what his mother described as a ' pretty routine operation '			1
after the surgery , the young boy went into recovery , but started to go downhill quickly			0
' we were holding him and over a few hours he became really hot and had a fever , ' ms @entity5 revealed			1
' his vital signs were dropping and he was having trouble breathing			0
' ' his stomach just tripled in size and had this red purple rash all over him , and as a mum you just know when something 's not right			0
' fortunately , @entity3 recovered from the virus			2
here he is seen with his scar after having his colostomy removed ms @entity5 said her son 's vital signs started dropping and he was having trouble breathing after the surgery the infection had eaten all the tissue in @entity3 's chest and abdomen , leaving him fighting for his life when the doctor who performed @entity3 's initial surgery came to check on the infant , he immediately rushed the baby back into theatre for an emergency procedure			1
' it was a bug that pretty much just ate all the tissue in his chest and abdomen , ' the twins ' mother said			0
' they said if we 'd waited another hour or two he would have definitely died , it attacks so quickly , ' ms @entity5 added			1
@entity3 had contracted necrotising fasciitis , a serious rapidly spreading infection that results in death of tissue			2
' it can be fatal if symptoms go undetected - approximately 25 per cent of patients with necrotising fasciitis and more than 30 per cent with streptococcal toxic shock syndrome die , ' @entity88 , chief executive of @entity89 , told @entity33			2
' a combination of bacteria caused @entity3 's case of necrotising fasciitis			2
' ms @entity5 revealed after such a tough few months early on in @entity10 and @entity3 's life , she did not know what to expect when he fell ill again thankfully @entity3 is now doing better but his mum says he is not quite back to normal just yet ms @entity5 said her and her partner were simply grateful for all the moments they got to share with their twins ms @entity5 praised the work of doctors at @entity106 where her son was treated , describing their work as ' amazing '			1
' the speed at which @entity41 clinicians identified @entity3 's symptoms was paramount to his recover , ' ms @entity110 said			2
' @entity3 â€™s treatment included the rapid administration of intravenous broad spectrum antibiotics and surgical removal of dying tissue as required			0
' we were delighted that @entity3 responded quickly to the range of antibiotics prescribed to combat the bacteria			0
' ms @entity5 revealed after such a tough few months early on in @entity10 and @entity3 's life , she did not know what to expect when he fell ill again			1
when her waters broke at 23 weeks , the doctor 's prognosis was nothing short of grim			0
' they said that normally when your waters break you go into labour within 24 hours and they said that would probably happen , ' ms @entity5 said			1
' they said they could n't resuscitate a baby that small ... so they said it would probably be best to wrap them up and keep them warm and cuddle them for as long as we can			0
' luckily after a few hurdles , the twins were able to go home after eight weeks , but when @entity3 got sick again she thought she may never get to take her little boy home for good			2
' i honestly thought i would never get to take him home			0
i remember just collapsing on the floor with my dad and saying " that 's my baby			0
what am i going to do if he dies ? " ' ms @entity5 said			2
thankfully @entity3 is now doing better but his mum says he is not quite back to normal			0
' i think the professor that operated that said he 's never seen something like what happened to @entity3 and he 's lucky to be alive , ' ms @entity5 said			1
' he 's not himself , he does n't want to be put down , and he was starting to crawl and sit up but he ca n't do that			0
' i think he still feels very vulnerable			0
' but ms @entity5 said her and her partner , @entity13 , were simply grateful for all the moments they got to share with their twins			1
' we do n't take anything for granted , ' she said .			0
