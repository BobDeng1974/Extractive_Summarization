by @entity0 in @entity1 one of the @entity3 ’s most senior money - men has been arrested in an alleged plot to smuggle 20 million euros into @entity5 from @entity6 aboard a government plane			1
monsignor @entity8 , the bishop of @entity9 , and the chief accountant for the @entity3 ’s vast property portfolio , has been taken into custody along with an @entity5 secret agent @entity13 and broker @entity14			1
@entity8 , 61 , who worked at @entity15 before taking ecclesiastical vows , is accused of fraud , corruption , and other charges , as part of a wider investigation into the @entity22			2
arrest : monsignor @entity8 , the bishop of @entity9 , the chief accountant for the @entity3 's vast property portfolio , has been taken into custody his nickname in @entity3 circles was reportedly ‘ @entity28 ’ thanks to his habit of showing people that he had only the largest bank note in his wallet			1
according to attorney @entity34 , @entity8 was a middleman in the @entity6 operation			2
friends had asked him to intervene with @entity14 to return 20 million euros they had given him to invest			2
@entity34 said @entity8 persuaded @entity14 to return the money , and an @entity5 secret service agent , @entity39 , went to @entity6 to bring the cash back aboard an @entity5 government aircraft			1
such a move would presumably prevent any reporting of the money coming into @entity5			2
the operation failed because @entity14 reneged on the deal , @entity34 said			2
@entity13 , nevertheless , demanded his 400,000 euros commission			0
@entity8 paid him an initial 200,000 euros by check , @entity34 said			0
the @entity3 bank , formerly known as the @entity50 , @entity22 , inside the @entity3 and monsignor @entity8 , the chief accountant for the @entity3 's property portfolio but in a bid to not have the second installment of the commission deposited , @entity8 filed a report for a missing 200,000 check , even though he knew @entity13 had it , @entity34 said			1
@entity14 and @entity13 also were arrested wednesday along with @entity8 , @entity34 said			1
when asked how @entity8 responded to the accusations , @entity34 said ' i think that @entity60 will respond to the questions			0
' it is not the only troubles @entity8 is facing			0
prosecutors in @entity9 have placed him under investigation for alleged money - laundering stemming from his account at the @entity3 's bank , called the @entity69 , or @entity22			1
the investigation concerns transactions @entity8 , then an official at the @entity72 for the patrimony of the @entity74 , made in 2009 in which he took 560,000 euros ( $ 729,000 ) in cash out of his personal @entity22 bank account and carried it out of the @entity3 and into @entity5 to help pay off a mortgage on his @entity9 home			1
the high profile arrests come just 48 hours after @entity83 announced the line up for his commission into the @entity69 to deposit the money into an @entity5 bank account - and to prevent family members from finding out he had such a large chunk of cash - he asked 56 close friends to accept 10,000 euros apiece in cash in exchange for a check or money transfer in the same amount , @entity34 said earlier this week			0
@entity8 was then able to deposit the amounts in his @entity5 account			1
the original money came into @entity8 's @entity22 account from donors who gave it to the prelate thinking they were funding a home for the terminally ill in @entity9 , @entity34 said			1
he said the donors had ' enormous ' wealth and could offer such donations for his charitable efforts			0
he said @entity8 had given the names of the donors to prosecutors and insisted the origin of the money was clean , that the transactions did n't constitute money - laundering , and that he only took the money " temporarily " for his personal use			0
the home for terminally ill has n't been built , though the property has been identified , @entity34 said			0
' he declares himself absolutely innocent , ' @entity34 said of the @entity9 investigation			0
the @entity3 spokesman , the rev. @entity120 , told the @entity121 earlier this week that the @entity3 is taking the appropriate measures to deal with @entity8 's case			1
there was no further comment friday from the @entity3 about @entity8 's arrest			1
the high profile arrests come just 48 hours after @entity83 announced the line up for his commission into the @entity69			0
the so - called ‘ @entity131 ‘ has been tarnished by scandal and suspicion for 30 years			0
any attempt to investigate by @entity5 authorities was viewed as an attack on the sovereignty of the @entity3 state			2
@entity83 said he needed to ensure the bank was running ‘ in harmony ’ with the church			0
according to a writ no one is allowed to refuse the commissioners information .			0
