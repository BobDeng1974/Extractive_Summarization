by @entity0 published : 07:43 est , 11 december 2012 updated : 10:44 est , 11 december 2012 a spoof video of a @entity4 company 's fictional bid to beam a cheese logo onto the moon has sparked panic at @entity9 overs fears it could threaten the @entity10			1
advertising executive @entity11 and his colleagues dreamed up the stunt by fictitious brand ' @entity15 ' as part of an annual joke video they send to clients for a festive treat			1
to research the script they emailed a junior aeronautics officer in the @entity24 to work out what would be required to beam an image onto the moon			2
however , it raised alarms at @entity9 who thought it was real			1
film production company @entity31 film their spoof advert on the moon - but failed to tell @entity9 the plan was a joke the firm claimed to have build a giant projector capable of projecting the @entity49 logo 220 miles onto the surface of the moon			1
however , in reality the projector seen in the video was a dummy made from just £ 15 of materials			2
the firm told @entity9 : ' we are currently building an extremely high - powered projection unit to project an image into space as part of an advertising campaign			1
' but the gag quickly escalated up to senior @entity9 officers and @entity11 received a string of terse emails warning his plans were illegal			1
the space scientists warned @entity11 ' multi media firm @entity69 that it would have to contact aviation regulators in their own country			2
producers at the advertising firm went ahead with the film - but yesterday admitted they had not contacted @entity9 to explain the enquiry had all been part of a joke			1
mr @entity11 , 42 , said : ' a couple of emails were exchanged and we were terrified we were going to get a call from federal agents			2
' obviously we did n't think it would cause quite the panic it did			0
' we were all laughing in the office because obviously it was just a bit of fun			0
' but i suppose @entity9 has a very serious job to do and they must get loons suggesting ideas all the time			1
' i suppose we just did n't expect @entity9 to react like it did , i hope they join in on the laugh when they watch the clip			1
' the firm produced detailed plans for the project which it asked @entity9 's advice on - but space bosses thought the plan was real @entity31 staff pretend they can see the image ( left ) and the machine the firm says projected their cheese logo onto the lunar surface ( right ) which was actually a £ 15 prop			1
@entity114 creative director @entity113 , 37 , came up with the idea of a spoof company which specialises in children 's cheese called @entity15 six months ago			2
as part of their usual script research the company called the @entity122 ( @entity122 ) on behalf of ' @entity49 '			0
they were told to ask @entity9 and dutifully contacted the space agency - neglecting to tell them about the joke because they believed it would stop them getting the information they wanted			1
mr @entity11 politely emailed @entity130 at @entity9 on november 27 querying the logistics of projecting onto the moon			1
he wrote : ' we are currently building an extremely high - powered projection unit to project an image into space as part of an advertising campaign			0
' this obviously is an unusual project and i am seeking advice and guidelines from the many departments governing the airspace above us			0
' this may be of no interest to you but we need to make sure that all the necessary authorities are notified accordingly			0
' could you direct me to any department that we will need to get permissions from			0
' an hour later he was ' cc 'd ' into an email from mr @entity130 to @entity9 officers @entity156 , @entity157 and @entity158 , outlining his concerns about the projection			1
the email read : ' @entity162 that is building an extremely high - powered projection unit to project an image into space as part of an advertising campaign and they want to know if there are any guidelines or limitations they should be aware of			0
stills from the spoof video showing a company 's fictional bid to beam their cheese logo on to the moon film producer @entity11 , 42 , was stunned by a glut of emails from @entity9 boffins urging him not to project the made - up ' @entity49 ' brand into space ' i immediately thought of the space station , which is why i 've forwarded this to you for response			1
' but a response from the @entity193 at @entity194 in @entity195 just five hours later showed they were taking the joke very seriously			0
@entity156 wrote : ' there are definitely international laws restricting lasers pointing into commercial air space			0
' also , if your light projection can in fact make it to 220 miles out , we would like to stay informed as it could potentially affect the astronauts on the @entity10			1
' the same day communications officer mr @entity156 wrote : ' if there 's a potential for the light to reach the space station and could potentially affect the crew 's vision or ability to see , we 'd need to be aware			0
' and in an email later the same night he added : ' it also occurs to me that since the @entity122 has rules , you should probably talk to whatever ministry covers commercial air ( and your version of @entity226 as well ) and see what sort of laws are in place in the @entity4 and @entity230			0
' @entity31 still went ahead with its video - and were even able to finish it with their quotes from @entity9			1
mooncheeze the joke product concocted by production company @entity69 in the video @entity113 , @entity11 and the rest of the production team talk about how they brainstormed for the making of the advert in an ' @entity245 ' style mockumentary			2
amusingly the ' projection ' equipment used in the spoof film was just a box made from black foam board and an old office lamp which cost prop designers just £ 15 to make			0
some of the comedy lines include ' the moon - it 's big , it 's ballsy , " and ' the world is no longer their oyster - the moon is too '			0
in another scene one employee of the company , based in @entity262 , @entity263 , jokes with a deadpan serious face : ' all we needed was for the moon to turn up			0
' the video shows the team planning and executing their plan to project a logo onto the lunar surface the video shows staff planning exactly where the logo should appear mr @entity11 said the idea behind the ' @entity49 ' advert was to make their clients laugh at the end of the year			2
he said : ' we did n't tell @entity9 it was a spoof because we needed to research it properly like we would do all our campaigns and we thought if we told them it was a fake they would n't help us out			2
' we obviously found it hilarious knowing the product and idea was just a spoof and that the projector was just something we had bashed together using an office lamp for the purpose of the film			0

joke *corporate* video claimed to be projecting a logo for a cheese firm onto the moon
led to string of terse emails from @entity9 warning the stunt could put the @entity10 in *danger*
