the days of gooey toothpaste tubes , bottles of stubborn ketchup and sticky glue pots are numbered			1
after unveiling its super slippery @entity8 coating last year , a team of @entity6 - based scientists has signed its first deal to bring the technology to supermarket shelves			1
@entity12 is the first firm to publicly announce a deal , and there are rumours a mayonnaise brand , and toothpaste company are also on board			1
@entity12 is the first firm to sign up , and reports claim a mayonnaise brand , and toothpaste firm , are also on board @entity8 was invented at @entity32 and its designers call it ' the first and only permanently wet , slippery surface technology '			1
it is based on previous super-hydrophobic technology , but takes this a step further			0
a conventional super-hydrophobic surface is similar to a lotus leaf - it is a highly textured surface that creates a cushion of air for the product to sit on			1
but @entity8 replaces this ' cushion of air ' with a layer of liquid			2
this so - called ' liquid - impregnated surface ' is a multi-layer surface consisting of a customised solid texture and a liquid			1
the solid surface is made up of spaces that are sufficiently close to each other to contain the impregnating liquid , and the liquid is held in place to create the permanently slippery surface			2
as a result , the ketchup , detergent or other product slides on the liquid layer , in a so - called ' liquid - to - liquid interface '			1

a conventional super-hydrophobic surface is similar to a lotus leaf - it is a highly textured surface which creates a cushion of air for the product to sit on			2
but @entity8 replaces this ' cushion of air ' , or gas , with a layer of liquid			2
a so - called ' liquid - impregnated surface ' is a multi-layer surface consisting of a customised solid texture and a liquid			1
the surface ( illustrated ) is made up of spaces that are sufficiently close to each other to contain the impregnating liquid and keep it in place the solid surface is made up of spaces that are sufficiently close to each other to contain the impregnating liquid and the liquid is held in place within the texture , creating a permanently slippery surface			2
as a result , the ketchup , detergent or other product slides on the liquid layer , in a so - called ' liquid - to - liquid interface '			1
and by changing the material used , and the structure of the coating , the researchers can also control the the speed at which liquids slide over the surface			0
the coating can also be made up of different materials , depending on the application			0
for example , when fitted inside ketchup bottles the liquid is plant - based , while other non-food stuffs can use non-edible chemicals			1
the firm said : ' first , we identify liquids that are compatible with the chemical and physical properties of our client ’s product			0
' once we have found a suitable liquid , we select solid materials that are promising to adhere to the client ’s surface and that will form a suitable porous structure			2
' the porous solid entraps the liquid through capillary forces			0
' these forces are sufficient to hold the liquid in place against forces greater than 50g			0
' once we have a prototype in place we create a scalable and commercially viable application process			0
' @entity135 result : a durable and high performing coating that meets all the requirements of our client			0
' and by changing the material used , and the structure of the coating , the researchers can also control the the speed at which liquids slide over the surface			0
the non-toxic lubricant can be used on both plastic and glass containers and can be adapted for different applications			1
a prototype liquiglide ketchup bottle came third in the inaugural visitor vote for the @entity153 ’s @entity152 2013			0
according to the inventors , each year an estimated one million tonnes of condiments are thrown away globally because leftovers can not be scraped from jars and bottles , with up to 15 per cent of a product remaining in its container			0

a conventional super-hydrophobic surface ( left ) has a highly textured surface that creates a cushion of air to reduce friction , but @entity8 replaces this air with liquid ( right ) according to the inventors , each year an estimated one million tonnes of condiments are thrown away globally because leftovers can not be scraped from jars and bottles , with up to 15 per cent of a product remaining in its container			1
the right - hand mustard bottle has been coated with @entity176 they also claim that eliminating safety caps on squeeze bottles could save 50,000 tons of plastic a year			2
not only does the product save waste and reduce the need for packaging , but it can also stop beer and fizzy drinks going flat			0
the smoother surface created by coating the inside of cans and bottles for carbonated drinks with the substance slows the release of carbon dioxide bubbles from a drink , keeping it fizzy for longer			2
the researchers can also control the speed of the liquid inside the container by changing the material used , and the structure of the coating			0
this gif shows three different coatings and their respective speeds			0

the non-toxic lubricant is called @entity8 and it was *developed* at @entity32
it creates a so - called ' liquid - impregnated surface ' so ketchup slides over it
these multi-layer surfaces can also be customised for other applications
for example , they can be added to bottles of glue , detergent and more
@entity8 has signed a deal with @entity223 and *adhesives*
mayonnaise brand , and a toothpaste firm are also said to have signed up
the lubricant can be used on both plastic and glass containers
