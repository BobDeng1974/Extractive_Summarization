scam : the gang advertised discounted cameras , via websites called @entity16 , @entity27 , and @entity28 , but the online shops were set up so that card payments would deliberately fail ' however , you knew what bank accounts to get , and how to play your part			1
the air of innocence you portrayed to the jury was clearly a facade			0
each of you knew precisely what was going on			0
' you were telling a cock and bull story that had probably been fed to you by those running this			0
the sad fact in this is that none of you realised how ridiculous those accounts were			0
@entity98 , of @entity99 , @entity45 , allowed his own bank account to be used to launder £ 4,307 from the illegal operation , the court heard			2

' he was worried about supporting his family so he allowed his bank account to be used , ' said ms @entity125			0
involvement : judge @entity112 said there was evidence to suggest @entity104 was more deeply involved in the fraud , with police finding a diary of passwords , contacts and account details at her home ' he says he was not aware of the larger scale of the operation			2
' the court heard criminals behind the online fraud , that operated from june 5 to december 1 , 2012 , are probably based in @entity17 and have not been caught			2
customers across @entity147 were conned with victims reported in @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 and @entity152			2
@entity104 , a full time carer for her family who has no previous convictions , laundered £ 16,695			2

judge @entity112 said : ' it ’s often said the internet has changed our lives immensely over the years			0
' what it has also done is open up opportunities for unscrupulous criminals to exploit unsuspecting members of the public at arm ’s length , who send money off to websites in the trusting expectation they will receive the goods which they have paid for			2
memorial : in may 2012 , @entity2 was sentenced to 18 weeks in prison after he attempted to steal a plaque that forms part of the @entity44 memorial in @entity45 victims : @entity47 , three , ( left ) and 12 - year - old @entity46 were killed in the explosion in february 1993 ' in order to operate a criminal scam of this kind it requires criminals who are prepared to allow existing bank accounts to be used for money from the unsuspecting public to be channelled into these accounts and then , within days , the cash withdrawn and funnelled back to the criminal enterprise			1
' this is the role you played			0
without your co-operation , this fraud could not have succeeded			0
you were a highly necessary ingredient			0
