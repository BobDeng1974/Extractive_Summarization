the fighter who calls himself ‘ @entity1 ’ is human after all			0
two months shy of his 50th birthday , @entity3 was well beaten by @entity4 who later advised the ring legend to call a halt to his illustrious 26 - year career			1
@entity3 was knocked down in the first round and lost every subsequent session of this light - heavyweight unification clash			1
‘ he fought a great technical fight			2
he has patience and every time he got hit he did the right thing and stepped back			0
‘ he ’s going to be around a long time and i ’ve got respect for someone who wants to fight the best			2
' i really do n't want to say anything [ about his future ]			0
it 's been 50 - 50 for the last nine years			2
' @entity3 , 18 years his opponent ’s senior , won his first world title when @entity4 was just 12			1
by the time the @entity40 turned professional 14 years later , @entity3 had already ruled the middleweight division for a decade			1
prior to saturday night , @entity3 had boxed 494 rounds , more than five times as many as @entity4			1
and @entity44 finally caught up with the @entity46 native who clung on during a torrid final round to avoid the first stoppage defeat of his career			2
‘ he was a really tough opponent , ’ said @entity4			2
he is very good at keeping the distance			0
i have a lot of respect for him but he needs to stop his career			0
‘ he needs to give opportunities to younger guys to be champions			0
‘ i wanted to show my fans that i can box ; i tried to knock him out but he has great defence			0
’ @entity4 hit the deck but only after a shove from @entity3 who struggled to cope against the younger man @entity3 ships a right hand from @entity4 , a pattern that was quickly established and continued throughout @entity4 controlled the distance well , not allowing @entity3 on to the front foot and nullifying his attack @entity3 lands a rare punch on @entity4 who was able to keep himself out of range over the 12 rounds more than 8,000 fans packed into the famed @entity76 in @entity77 , just a four - minute drive from the venue for @entity3 ’ first professional fight – a defeat – in 1988			1
since then , @entity3 has proved himself a master at picking the right opponent at the right time to become the sport 's oldest - ever world champion			1
that followed a four - year stint as the undisputed middleweight king and a decade - long reign as the holder of at least one of the multiple belts			1
@entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 were among those swept aside			0
our own @entity101 ’s @entity100 triumph over the @entity103 in 2008 looked more impressive with every subsequent win			0
but on this occasion , @entity3 ’ timing was out			2
@entity4 , who grew up in poverty in north - east @entity40 , was one step too far			1
@entity3 looked composed between rounds despite the fact he was being comprehensively beaten towards the end , @entity3 looked resigned to defeat as he sat slumped on his stool inbetween rounds fifteen months ago , he destroyed @entity115 @entity114 in four brutal rounds in @entity117 to win the @entity119 title			2
it was a particularly sweet victory given the three years he spent at the beginning of his career fighting for free as he tried to make his way in @entity124			0
he will be paid handsomely for this victory which adds the @entity127 and @entity128 belts to his collection			0
the tone was set from the first bell as @entity3 was backed up on the ropes			2
he took a right to the top of the head which , along with a slight slip , sent him to the canvas			0
from then on , @entity4 controlled the contest , proving he is more than a knock - out artist			1
it was n’t until the seventh round that @entity3 landed anything of significance but even that did n’t win him the session on the judges ’ cards which read 120 - 107 twice and 120 - 106			1
and the concluding three minutes were hard to watch			0
@entity4 set about trying to finish off the elder statesman while the referee hovered , perhaps a little too keen to preserve @entity3 ’ record of always hearing the final bell			1
thirty eight punches reigned in , more than in any round of any of @entity3 ' previous 41 fights tracked by data analysts @entity156			1
but make it he did			0
perhaps for the final , final time			0
@entity4 went on the attack in the final round in an attempt to be the first man to stop @entity3 @entity3 came under incredible pressure towards the end of the fight but managed to take @entity4 the distance the @entity40 sends down another barrage of blows but @entity3 ' granite chin withstood the punishment @entity4 celebrates his career - defining victory over @entity3 after an inspired performance in @entity77			1

@entity3 failed to *trouble* the hard - hitting @entity40 @entity4
the 49 - year - old legend was knocked down in the first round
he survived but could not get a *foothold* in the fight
@entity4 unifies three of the belts with a wide , *unanimous* points *decision*
