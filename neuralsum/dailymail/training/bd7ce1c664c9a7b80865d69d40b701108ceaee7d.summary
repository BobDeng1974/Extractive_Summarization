but now some of them may be taking a rethink - or at least considering wearing a bathing costume - as they have attracted a some rather unwelcome swimming companions			0
a breed of giant crayfish have appeared and are taking a keen interest in the swimmers , with an apparent penchant for the @entity15 , where many of the visitors swim naked			1
relaxing : swimmers may be unaware that they might be joined be unwelcome guests in the pond visitors : the red swap crayfish is know for being aggressive the recent reports of the rather painful encounters have caused authorities to issue a new warning , advising swimmers to avoid entering the water in the nude			1
regulars at the @entity31 park include judges , senior civil servants and local actors , artists and writers			0
along with the well - to - do locals , @entity39 , best known for playing @entity40 used the @entity41 in the 1950s and actress @entity37 was a regular in the 1960s , but chose to don a swimming costume			1
boxers @entity45 and @entity47 have both used the @entity15 to prepare for fights and more recently @entity49 used it as a location for ' @entity51 '			1
although the red swamp crayfish , which are known for their aggressive behaviour and long claws , were first spotted 20 years ago , they have been multiplying so fast that around 5,000 of the nippers are in the ponds			1
chairman of the @entity59 said one member had caught 180 of the crayfish in just one hour			2
cheeky : the giant crayfish have are multiplying so fast that 5,000 are said to be colonising the ponds he said : ' they just breed and breed and breed			1
they eat all the fish in the ponds and there is nothing we can do to stop them			2
they are destroying the wildlife			0
' but the bathers may be rather more worried about the physical impact of the invasion			2
one swimmer , @entity79 , 43 , said : ' i 've had a couple of nips on my toes in the past few months , usually when i stop for a rest and tread water			2
but some people have been nipped in altogether more sensitive places , which does n’t bear thinking about			0
' a fellow swimmer said he had also experienced a crayfish 's wrath after being nipped on the bottom			2
' i suppose i was lucky really - if the crayfish had decided to attack from the other side i would have been in a lot more pain , ' he said			0
' from now on i ’m wearing my trunks			0
' regular : @entity39 , best known for playing @entity40 may not have been happy to be joined by crayfish glamorous : @entity37 was a regular at the @entity99 in the 1960s but chose to wear a costume a spokesman for the @entity102 , which runs the heath said : ' we do n't know how [ the crayfish ] got there , but a likely explanation is that they were dumped in the ponds			1
now that they are here , we would recommend that swimmers keep their distance to avoid getting a pinch			1
we would also advise people to wear clothes			0
' the heath has three areas open to bathers - the @entity120 , @entity121			0
the crayfish are not the fist species to invade the ponds , which have been open to bathers since the 19th century			1
as well as contended with the odd angry duck , swimmers have become used to a colony of parakeets who have also made the heath their home , possibly after having arrived after escaping from the set of @entity135 's 1951 film ' @entity134 ' which was shot at @entity136 in @entity137			0
unsuspecting : naked bathers in the @entity6 ponds may be in for a nasty and little nippy surprise watch out : those going for a dip in the @entity120 may be best advised to wear swimming trunks crayfish are significantly smaller , freshwater cousins of the lobster			1
the red swamp variety , also known as the @entity149 crawfish is native to the @entity150 and @entity151 , but was first noticed in @entity6 ponds in 1991			1
the species are able to grow quickly , being able to tolerate dry spells of up to four months , and can reach sizes of 12 cm long			0
in northern @entity157 , the populations are self maintaining but not expanding , while in southern @entity157 , the red swamp crayfish is multiplying and actively colonising new territory , at the expense of the native crayfish			1
individuals are reported to be able to cross many miles of relatively dry ground , especially in wet seasons , although the aquarium trade and anglers may have hastened the spread in some areas			0
@entity149 crayfish are usually boiled in a large pot with heavy seasoning and other items such as potatoes , corn on the cob , onions , garlic , and sausage , known as a ' crayfish boil ' .			0

red swamp crayfish have been multiplying so fast that around 5,000 of the nippers are in the ponds .
