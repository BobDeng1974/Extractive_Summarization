by @entity0 @entity1 may be a step closer to staging a @entity3 on the streets of @entity5 after prime minister @entity6 announced new plans to hold motor races on public roads			1
a race on the streets of the capital has been mooted for a number of years with @entity1 supremo @entity14 keen to bring a @entity16 - style race to the capital			1
and today 's new regulation , which gives local authorities the power to sign off on major motor races on public roads for the first time , rather than needing specific approval from @entity25 , has once more raised the possibility of a @entity27			1
centre of attention : prime minister @entity6 addresses the crowd at @entity31 on friday ' i can announce today that we are going to enable more road races for @entity36 motor sport , ' prime minister @entity6 said as he official opened @entity39 ' new Â£ 8million advanced engineering facility at the team 's @entity1 headquarters in @entity42			2
' we think this will be really useful to @entity45 motor sport : more races , more events , more money coming into the country and more success for this extraordinary industry			0
' next year will see the new @entity53 championship race through @entity54 and @entity5 mayor @entity55 is hopeful of bringing @entity1 to the city , too			2
back to the future : @entity58 proposed a night race on the streets of @entity5 back in 2012 a spokeswoman for mr @entity55 said : ' the mayor is already backing the @entity53 championship race in @entity54 next year and thinks @entity1 itself is a fantastic event that any city would feel privileged to host - he is always interested in projects that attract jobs and bring growth			1
' he is positive that @entity5 would do a spectacular job of hosting an @entity71 ; but it is impossible to say what the impact might be without detailed planning and research and the question of air quality and noise impact would have to be looked at very carefully			0
' but @entity14 , 83 , has warned that a @entity27 remains a long shot			1
for @entity14 , whose dream has long been to see @entity1 careering around @entity5 's landmarks , it means one strip of red tape has been removed , with the likelihood legislation will be in force next year			2
how it could look : @entity90 takes a @entity91 for a spin through the streets of @entity5 back in 2004 on track : a @entity95 sails through @entity96 on a demonstration run 10 years ago but the 83 - year - old , however , appreciates finding the money for such an event remains one of the many other hurdles that would need to be overcome as the costs would be significant			1
' in the past we spoke to the old mayor and all sorts of people , ' said @entity14			0
' it just depends on what we can come up with commercially because how are we going to fund it ? ' the news is good , but i do n't know whether you 'd have street racing because it 's not cheap to put on something that 's safe			0
' but if they ever get it together then we 'll see what happens			0
at least it 's a good sign , a step in the right direction			0
