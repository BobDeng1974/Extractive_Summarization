by @entity0 published : 19:11 est , 13 november 2013 updated : 19:12 est , 13 november 2013 @entity1 : justice secretary @entity2 will stop officers from giving ' slap on the wrist ' cautions to repeat offenders nearly 5,000 thugs , shoplifters and vandals have received multiple police cautions for similar offences within just two years , figures have revealed			1
@entity14 figures show that 4,763 adults received two or more cautions for identical or similar offences in the two years to march 31			2
they included around 1,500 people who committed common assaults , 750 drugs offenders , 500 shoplifters and 700 people guilty of criminal damage			1
but justice secretary @entity2 yesterday announced plans to ban officers from giving out the so - called ‘ slaps on the wrist ’ to repeat offenders			1
victims campaigners have long complained that police cautions are overused and allow too many criminals to escape formal justice			1
a simple caution means that the offender receives no punishment , and a record of their offending is kept only for a limited period of time			0
the only requirement is that they accept their guilt			0
ministers have already announced plans to abolish simple cautions for serious offences including rape and robbery			1
last night mr @entity2 said : ‘ the current range of out of court disposals are confusing and the system is overly bureaucratic , that is why we are reviewing all out of court disposals			1
' they should be consistent , straightforward and something in which victims and the wider public can have confidence			0
’ @entity14 figures show a total of 4,763 adult criminals received two or more cautions for the same or similar offences in the two years to march 31 this year			2
changes to the law brought in next year will mean officers can not give out a second caution for a similar offence within two years			0
only in exceptional circumstances will it be allowed - and must be signed off by an officer of @entity76 rank			0
magistrates and victims groups will also be given new powers to inspect how forces give out cautions to make sure they are not used excessively			2
soft touch no more : police officers will be stopped from routinely giving offenders a second caution for similar offences within two years the decision follow a major review of cautioning conducted by the @entity14			1
also under review are spot fines and cannabis warnings			0
earlier this year mr @entity2 warned spot fines had allowed gangs of yobs to commit crime and anti-social behaviour ‘ regardless of the consequences ’			1
he said thugs even put aside cash to pay the penalty notices , then carry on offending , and claimed high streets have become ‘ fair game ’ for low level offenders who make life a misery for the public			0
@entity108 , of the @entity109 , said : ‘ it is in everyone ’s interests that the justice system is as simple and clear to understand as possible			0
' the current range of out of court disposals is too complicated and bureaucratic - we recommended and support its review			2
‘ it is important that there is room for officer discretion in any system to ensure the punishment is proportionate to the offence			0
criminal justice minister @entity126 said : ‘ the current police guidance for dealing with crimes on - the - spot has evolved over time and is totally disjointed , no wonder we see a dramatic variation in their use			1
‘ that is why we are clamping down on the use of cautions and reviewing the whole spectrum of out of court disposals so we have clarity and consistency and most importantly we have a system that victims and the public have confidence in			2
’ the review of all out of court disposals is set to conclude in spring 2014 .			0
