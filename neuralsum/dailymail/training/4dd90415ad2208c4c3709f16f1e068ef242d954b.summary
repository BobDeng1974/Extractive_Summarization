@entity0 was told by another mother to ' put her boob away ' when she was breastfeeding @entity3 a mother who was told to ' put her boob away ' by another woman when she was breastfeeding her six - month - old toddler has triggered an online frenzy			1
when @entity0 was breastfeeding her son @entity3 by the pool at @entity10 in @entity11 , north of @entity12 , she noticed a woman smoking a cigarette a couple of seats away on tuesday			1
the 28 - year - old thought it would be a good idea to glance over at the woman so she would get the hint to ' put her smoke out ' or at least move away from the children playing nearby			1
but as soon as the woman caught a glimpse of @entity0 looking at her , she stormed over and told the mother of five : ' i think you should put your boob away			1
' ‘ i was shocked , especially coming from another mother , ’ @entity0 told @entity28			1
' the woman was smoking and standing really close to the kids but all she got from my glance was to tell me that i should n't have my boob out in front of the children , especially hers			1
' i do n't mind smokers but it was illegal of her to smoke so close to the children , especially in a public play area but i politely smiled , turned my back and continued to feed my little bub			1
‘ if my bub is hungry , he ’s going to be fed – no matter where we are			0
her comment does n’t bother me and i did n't want to cause a scene because there were children around			1
from left : @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 holding @entity3 and @entity62 after @entity0 got home from the water park , she posted her experience online , which prompted a frenzy of discussion about mothers who breastfeed or smoke in public			1
' to a lady that was smoking at the water park who told me off for breastfeeding my baby			1
i was covered with a towel love			2
get out of the park and smoke you stupid woman , ’ she wrote			0
several mothers said they believed the comment from the woman smoking was inconsiderate while embracing @entity0 ’s decision for standing her ground and continuing to feed her baby			1
one woman wrote : ‘ wow			0
what is wrong with people these days			0
feels like society is going backwards			0
breastfeeding should be more acceptable not looked down on			2
that smoker woman should be ashamed of herself			0
’ splashing time ! on the companys 's website in the ' rules and conditions ' it clearly states as @entity100 : ' @entity102 entire facility is a non-smoking venue ' another woman posted : ‘ just another nasty & ignorant person			0
i suspect she was acting more out of embarrassment for being caught smoking near children than for her actual disapproval of breastfeeding in public			1
’ one woman wrote : ‘ actually it is illegal to smoke within a certain distance of a child 's park , has been for years			0
and the water park is a child 's park			0
so breastfeeding @entity118 was doing what is legal , smoking woman was breaking the law			2
’ while another woman said : ‘ do n't let her upset you , there are people who just enjoy being horrible ! breastfeeding is natural and beautiful			2
there are women that topless sunbathe down the road from me on there front lawn , nobody complains about them lol			0
' on the @entity10 website in the ' rules and conditions ' it clearly states as rule no. 6 : ' @entity102 entire facility is a non-smoking venue			0
' when the 28 - year - old was breastfeeding her son @entity3 at a water park , she was rudely told to cover up the 28 - year - old took it to social media and has triggered an online discussion with other mothers and it was n’t the first time the mother of five was told to cover up when she was nursing one of her children at the shops			1
‘ i was feeding one of my kids when a man approached me and told me to go to the toilets so i told him “ would you like to eat your lunch in the toilet ? ” and he just shook his head and walked off			2
‘ people need to realise it ’s a natural thing and there ’s nothing wrong with it			0
they need to get over themselves – it ’s baby food supply so deal with it			2
‘ if you do n’t like it , do n't go out in public or just keep your comments to yourself			0
’ a representative for @entity102 could n't be reached .			0
