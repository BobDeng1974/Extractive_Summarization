@entity12 , 56 , buried his wife the front garden of their home in @entity16 , @entity17 , when she died from oesophageal cancer after 18 years by his side			1
pious : @entity5 plans to turn the burial plot into a shrine for her late husband tribute : @entity12 has buried his late wife @entity25 in the front garden of their @entity17 home @entity5 decided that she did not want her husband @entity29 laid to rest in an ' impersonal ' cemetery , so she commissioned an undertaker to dig a plot round the back of their house in @entity36 , @entity37			1
mrs @entity5 , a devout @entity38 arranged for a priest to lead the ceremony - but when he was unble to attend , she carried out the service herself			1
' i first saw something about home burials in a newspaper more than 20 years ago , ' the 81 - year - old said			2
' graveyards are so regimented and impersonal - so i thought would n't it be nice to be buried at home			2
' @entity29 and i were both interested in the idea			1
i 'm just so glad we were able to do it			0
it is a great comfort for me knowing he is buried in the garden			1
' burial : @entity5 had her husband @entity29 laid to rest in their back garden in @entity36 couple : the pair were married in 1986 after meeting when they were both primary school teachers home burials are perfectly legal in @entity64 , under the terms of the @entity66 of 1880			1
as long as the bereaved party owns the freehold on the land containing the burial plot , it is not usually necessary to seek any sort of official permission from authorities			0
however , there are some environmental restrictions governing home burials - for example , bodies must not be interred too near certain bodies of water			0
in addition , corpses must be buried at least two feet below the soil			2
those considering home burials are advised to contact the police in advance , as mrs @entity5 did , to avoid any suspicion of lawbreaking			1
estate agents claim that having a body buried on your property can reduce the value of the home by up to Â£ 50,000			2
mrs @entity5 , a former teacher , asked undertakers @entity95 and @entity97 to arrange the burial			1
chief executive @entity99 said : ' the home burial for mr @entity101 was very unusual because it is at the back of a resident house in the middle of @entity36			1
' it is certainly the first time we have done a home burial of this kind , in such a residential area			0
normally , it would be a remote house with acres of land , but @entity5 's request was unique			1
' ' once the legalities had been cleared with the council , it was relatively straightforward			0
we made sure the spot was appropriate , prepared the grave and the brought to coffin to the house the night before the burial			0
' when the priest mrs @entity5 had asked to attend the service fell ill and could not attend , she decided to step in and do it herself			1
' with my experience as a schoolteacher , carrying out assemblies , i knew i would be able to carry out the service , ' she said			2
' we had about 15 people here and i had worked hard the night before to organise the traditional readings			0
' mr @entity99 said : ' we attended the service , which was conducted in the house by mrs @entity5			1
it was very moving and she is a very talented lady			0
' we then carried the coffin out to the garden where the burial took place			2
' tribute : mrs @entity5 thought that it would be too ' impersonal ' to bury @entity29 in a public graveyard devout : mrs @entity5 , a @entity38 , conducted her husband 's funeral service herself legal : the 81 - year - old warned officials in advance that she was planning the unusual burial mr and mrs @entity5 were married for 27 years after they met while teaching at a primary school in @entity36 , where they occupied classrooms opposite each other			1
while home burials are perfectly legal , local officials urged the widow to warn the police in advance so they would not suspect any wrongdoing			0
in addition , mrs @entity5 checked that her neighbours had no problem with the burial going ahead			1
' not many people know that home burials are allowed , but it is a lovely idea to keep a loved one close and i hope that @entity29 's grave can become a religious shrine , ' she said			1
tragic : @entity172 died of cancer just six weeks after marrying mr @entity12 mr @entity12 , whose wife @entity174 died of cancer just six weeks after their wedding , also decided to bury his partner in the front garden of the home in @entity17			2
the couple , who had been together for 18 years before marrying , had lived in the house for 14 years			0
when the pair married ms @entity174 was so ill she needed an oxygen mask to attend the ceremony			0
she died in hospital on november 14 , and last weekend mr @entity12 laid her to rest in the garden			0
moving : the bereaved husband wanted a special way to remember his late wife ' our home was our little castle , we loved it here , there are a lot of memories , it may not have suited everyone , but it suited us , ' he said			0
' she is my sweetheart and i want her close to me always			0
i do n't want her in a field with a load of strangers			0
' i do n't want her away from me and i do n't think she would want to ever be too far from home - our favourite place			0
' we spoke about where she would like to be buried and she had no objections - it is a hard thing to talk about			0

@entity5 did not want husband @entity29 to be buried in a graveyard
so she hired undertakers to bury him in her back garden in @entity36
