by @entity0 , political correspondent published : 13:39 est , 1 september 2013 updated : 02:44 est , 2 september 2013 support : chancellor @entity2 said he is ' passionate ' about @entity3 and thinks it could heal @entity7 's @entity6 divide @entity2 vowed yesterday that the controversial @entity3 rail project will go ahead despite fears over soaring costs			1
the chancellor said he was ‘ passionate ’ about the planned high - speed rail line which will link @entity13 to the @entity14 and @entity15			1
costs of @entity3 have hit nearly £ 50billion , including £ 7.5billion for rolling stock and £ 42.6billion for the infrastructure , which was up from the original estimates of £ 30billion in 2010			1
business leaders – including the @entity21 – have branded it a ‘ grand folly ’ , while @entity22 , the former @entity23 chancellor who backed the project in its early stages , has warned it is turning into a ‘ nightmare ’ and that its perceived benefits were ‘ highly contentious ’			1
@entity3 is set to be constructed from 2017 , and run 225mph trains from @entity13 to @entity32 by 2026 and on to @entity33 and @entity34 by 2032 - 3			1
but it has managed to provoke the ire of backbench @entity37 and residents along its proposed route , which also cuts through the @entity41 , an area of outstanding natural beauty			2
however , a defiant mr @entity2 said the rail project will heal the north / south divide			1
‘ i ’m passionate about this project because time and again , we have this debate in our country about how we ’re going to bring the gap between north and south together , about how we ’re going to make sure that our growth is not just based on the @entity54 , ’ he told the @entity47 ’s @entity46			2
‘ @entity3 is about changing the economic geography of this country , making sure the @entity57 and the @entity15 benefit from the recovery as well			2
’ asked whether he would withdraw his support if costs hit £ 70billion or £ 90billion , he said : ‘ we have set the budget for £ 42bn for the construction costs			1
that includes , by the way , a big contingency			2
’ he denied that costs were out of control and said @entity3 could even come in under budget			2
‘ as we demonstrated with the @entity69 , we can deliver these big projects actually under budget			0
’ mr @entity2 also defended his controversial ‘ help to buy ’ house buying scheme to help cash - strapped people onto the property ladder			1
the scheme allows people to borrow part of their deposit from the government at cheap interest rates , and allows families to buy homes in @entity7 with a deposit of just five per cent			1
but critics have warned the scheme would fuel the housing bubble and make property even less affordable for future generations			2
long term benefits : @entity3 is set to be constructed from 2017 , and run 225mph trains from @entity13 to @entity32 by 2026 and on to @entity33 and @entity34 by 2032 - 3 @entity92 director , @entity91 said : ‘ it is crazy for the government to stoke demand even more without addressing supply and claim that this will help the housing market			1
' making taxpayer - subsidised handouts to homebuyers will only drive further house prices up , risking a bubble , improving access for a select few but making housing even more unaffordable for most people			0
’ the right - of - centre think tank will tomorrow publish a review of the scheme called @entity109 in which it will argue for planning laws to be liberalised to help developers build more homes			0
mr @entity2 denied that his home buying scheme risked fuelling prices , saying too much of the media and political debate was focused on what happened in @entity13			1
‘ outside the centre of @entity13 , actually there ’s not some housing boom or some dramatic increase in house prices			1
' there are many , many thousands of families watching this programme who ca n’t begin to afford the mortgage deposits that are required to buy a home			0
former labour chancellor said the project has turned into a ' nightmare ' and @entity23 ’s shadow chief secretary to the treasury @entity134 ( right ) said @entity2 's mantra ' we 're in this together ' is n't true as house prices continue to soar ' they aspire to own their own home , that ’s a noble aspiration and i want to help them			1
’ clutching a walking stick for support , @entity46 returned to front his @entity47 politics show yesterday , nine months after a massive stroke			0
the broadcaster , 53 , still has impaired mobility in his left arm and leg			0
he told viewers : ‘ well , here we are again			0
i have to start with a few “ thank yous ” , to all my excellent colleagues who have been keeping the show on the road			0
thanks also to all the many viewers who ’ve sent so many kind and wise messages			0
’ he dismissed claims that the recovery would be limited to house prices , saying it was ‘ quite broadly based ’			0
‘ of course it ’s in its early stages and although things are looking up , we must n’t let up			0
we ’ve got to absolutely go on doing the things necessary to fix what went wrong in our economy and this government ’s got an economic plan to do that			0
’ @entity134 , @entity23 ’s shadow chief secretary to the treasury said : ‘ @entity2 claims we are all in this together , but for ordinary people life is getting harder			1
' working people are worse off as prices continue rising faster than wages , yet millionaires have been given a huge tax cut			0
‘ as the governor of the @entity186 has warned this is the slowest recovery on record , with almost one million young people out of work			2
’ she said @entity23 would bring in a new 10p lower rate of tax and invest more in infrastructure and building new homes .			0

**network** will be constructed from 2017 and is designed to run services from @entity13 to @entity34
@entity22 warned the ' highly contentious project ' is turning into a ' *disaster* '
chancellor @entity2 said the rail project could solve @entity7 's @entity204 divide
costs for high speed **network** have reached almost £ 50billion
