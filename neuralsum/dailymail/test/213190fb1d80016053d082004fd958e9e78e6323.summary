@entity1 's watch hits stores this friday when customers and employees alike will be able to pre-order the timepiece			1
and boss @entity6 is rewarding his staff by offering them a 50 per cent discount on the device			1
any employee working in the regions where the watch is being launched - including the @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 - will be eligible			0
it does not apply to the edition model ( right ) the plans were in a memo leaked to @entity1 fansite @entity34 in which mr @entity6 wrote : ' i know that many of you have been looking forward to choosing an @entity26 for yourselves , and we want to make it easy for you			1
' starting friday a special @entity42 will offer a 50 % discount on any @entity26 or @entity44 for your personal use			1
' notably , the discount does n't apply to the expensive edition model , which starts at $ 10,000 in the @entity14 and £ 8,000 in the @entity15			0
mr @entity6 continued that as the watch is introduced in more countries , this price plan will be extended			1
prices for the sport model start at $ 349 in the @entity14 and £ 299 in the @entity15 , while the stainless steel @entity55 starts at $ 549 ( £ 479 )			0
@entity1 's watch goes on display around the world on 10 april and people can pre-order it at 12.01 @entity60 ( 8am bst ) on this day			1
@entity56 will then go on general sale on 24 april in the @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 earlier this week , @entity1 released the first four guided tour videos of its watch , and said more are ' coming soon			1
' these videos ( pictured ) include an introduction to the main features , plus how to use the @entity68 app , customise the face , and use digital touch this means @entity14 employees will only pay $ 174.50 and $ 274 respectively , while in the @entity15 the price drops to £ 149.50 and £ 239.50			0
like many firms , @entity1 staff already reportedly receive a discount across the product range and this is said to be around 30 per cent			1
according @entity80 senior analyst @entity79 , @entity1 will sell a million watches in its first weekend on sale , three times the first - day sales of @entity1 's last all - new product , the @entity84			2
it would put the @entity26 behind @entity1 's first @entity84 , which sold 3 million in its first weekend in 2010 , but ahead of the first @entity85 , which sold 700,000 units when it debuted in 2007			2
however , it would be a fraction of the 10 million @entity85 and 6 pluses sold in the same timespan			0
the half - price watch discounts apply from friday and will last for 90 days			1
it is not clear whether employees can buy multiple watches under the scheme and @entity1 has refused to comment			1
mr @entity6 added : ' congratulations to everyone who has worked to help this product reach our customers			2
' and thanks in advance to the thousands of retail employees around the world who will start placing it on people 's wrists starting friday			2
' although going on display in stores this weekend , the @entity26 wo n't go on sale generally until the 24 april			0
although it could be seen as a way to boost sales , @entity114 telecoms expert at @entity115 , told @entity119 the plans will benefit customers : ' @entity1 knows it 's wading into unchartered territory with a costly , and as yet unproven , device			1
' what better way to instill the idea the watch is a must - have accessory than offer deep discounts for its biggest evangelists ? the videos also give an overview of how to see more options by pressing the screen			0
these options change depending on the app being used			0
for instance , when working out , it lets a wearer stop the workout the left - hand image shows how the digital crown can be used to select from a list of emoticons			0
the right - hand image shows the crown being used to select contacts after the button on the side has been pressed ' it means those on the front line have actual experience they can draw on when making sales , and a stronger narrative for prospective buyers			0
' according @entity80 senior analyst @entity79 , @entity1 is expected to sell a million watches in its first weekend on sale , three times the first - day sales of @entity1 's last all - new product , the @entity84			2
it would put the @entity26 behind @entity1 's first @entity84 , which sold 3 million in its first weekend in 2010 , but ahead of the first @entity85 , which sold 700,000 units when it debuted in 2007			2
however , it would be a fraction of the 10 million @entity85 and 6 pluses sold in the same timespan			0
earlier this week , @entity1 released the first four guided tour videos of its watch , and said more are ' coming soon			0
