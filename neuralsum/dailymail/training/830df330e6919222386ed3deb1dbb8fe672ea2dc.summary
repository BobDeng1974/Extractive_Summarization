the snake is patterned like a venomous snake , but is largely harmless , as an adder 's venom is treatable , and the snakes are quite rare to see slithering about at first glance this snake appears to be a venomous sidewinder that has slithered across a desert			1
but the serpent is actually an adder that was caught on camera making its way across a sandy beach in @entity14			2
the 3ft long snake was snapped by @entity16 who spotted it and its lengthy trail while he watched the sunset at @entity21 beach , near @entity22 , @entity14			1
he used his camera tripod to scoop it up away from the incoming tide and moved it to safety behind some sand dunes			0
@entity16 , 25 , from @entity27 , said : ' i was photographing the sunset when i saw a trail in the sand and assumed a child had dragged a stick down the beach			1
' it was only whilst walking further down the beach that i noticed there was something at the end of the trail , it turned out to be an adder			2
' it was the first time i had seen an adder and i was shocked at how small it was , it was a beautiful creature			0
' i was amazed by the great distance it had travelled while being in the open with the danger of being stepped on or taken by predators			0
' the sun had set and the snake remained in stasis			2
due to snakes being cold blooded its body was starting to shut down			0
from far away , the snake seems like a venemous sidewinder that would better fit into a desert ' i was sure that with it being so far out in the middle of the beach and with the incoming tide , its chances of survival were slim			1
' so using my tripod i carried the adder to the safety and shelter of the sand dunes behind the beach			0

the snake was spotted by @entity72 photographer @entity16 on @entity21 beach near @entity22
