sir @entity3 's bravery in leading @entity4 during the @entity5 may have been down to him suffering ' short man syndrome ' , a new book by @entity1 has claimed			1
the mayor of @entity8 says that with the wartime prime minister standing at just five feet six inches tall , there is evidence to suggest he was driven to succeed to prove a point to bigger bullies at school , who teased him for his height			1
so - called ' short man syndrome ' has been described by scientists where short men overcompensate for their lack of height through acts of aggression			1
and in mr @entity1 's new biography on @entity3 , who was two inches shorter than @entity39 , he suggests the syndrome was what spurred him on to tackle bigger bullies			1
in the book , serialised in the @entity49 , mr @entity1 writes : ' who else was 5 foot 6 or under ? some of the biggest tyrants and creeps in world history : @entity55 ( 5 feet 6 ) , @entity40 ( ditto ) , @entity41 ( ditto ) @entity42 ( teensy at 5 feet 4 )			2
@entity39 was only 5 feet 8			2
' all these characters have been associated with the over-compensatory aggression that is sometimes referred to as ' short - man ' syndrome ; and there is some evidence , at least on the face of it , that @entity3 did , too			1
' at five foot eight , @entity39 , left , was two inches taller than @entity3			1
so - called ' short - man ' syndrome is often referred to as @entity66 , named after @entity40 , right , who was five feet seven the new book , called the @entity69 , took the author over a year to research and will be published later this month ahead of the 50th anniversary of the leader 's death			1
in it mr @entity1 also explains how @entity3 's early life as a pupil at the prestigious @entity78 may have led him to show he was made of stern stuff after being bullied for being a ' runt '			2
he explains that @entity3 was not in the @entity78 football team , the school 's more violent version of the game , or the cricket team and even ran away from other pupils on one occasion when they threw cricket balls at him			0
he also suggests that he probably would have been picked on for his lisp and speech impediment too			0
mr @entity1 , who himself is five feet ten inches tall , adds : ' @entity3 's bravery was n't something he just put on			1
it was n't a mask he struggled with			0
he was made like that			0
the spirit of derring - do just pumped through his veins , like some higher - octane fuel than the one the rest of us run on			0
' however , mr @entity1 explains that what sets @entity3 apart from other 20th century leaders was his ' greatness of heart ' and his ability to be immensely compassionate			2
he points out that when @entity3 's mother decided to sack his nanny , he used his small income to give her financial support as he was so appalled			0
studies into so - called short - man syndrome say that society 's obsession with height forces smaller men to overcompensate by becoming chippy , more aggressive and - in extreme cases - lust power			1
however , some have questioned whether the syndrome , sometimes called @entity66 after @entity40 is real			0
historians have also pointed out that at 5 feet 7 , @entity40 was around the average height for his day			0
mr @entity1 also points out that tyrants @entity41 , left , and @entity42 , right , have also been associated with short - man syndrome meanwhile mr @entity1 has also said he believed the wartime leader would have approved of @entity128 ’s decision to back air strikes on @entity130			1
he made the comments after revealing thousands of terror suspects in the @entity4 are being monitored by the security services			0
' i think he would be appalled by the spectacle of these cowards executing journalists , and i think he would have wanted to do something to set them back a long way , and if need be , to neutralise them altogether , ’ mr @entity1 said			0
‘ he was a great believer in air power – do n’t forget he invented the @entity144 – so i think he ’d do exactly what the prime minister is doing			2
