by @entity0 @entity1 and its allies were accused by @entity3 today of using blackmail in a bid to secure a new @entity7 resolution that would authorise the use of force in @entity10			1
the extraordinary allegation by foreign minister @entity12 came as @entity10 troops and rebels clashed repeatedly inside the tightly controlled capital @entity16 in what activists called some of the worst fighting since the country 's crisis began 16 months ago			1
in a major boost for the new emboldened rebels , major - general @entity23 , the former head of @entity10 's chemical weapons programme , was reported to have defected and taken up a post as head of the joint military leadership of the @entity30			1
the defection would be a boost too for western intelligence as @entity23 could have crucial details of the nuclear and chemical weapons programme of @entity37 , a key @entity10 ally			1

mr @entity12 staked out a tough position before talks in @entity65 with @entity7 envoy @entity66 , dismissing international pressure on @entity3 and @entity68 to stop propping up @entity10 president @entity69			1
his comments are likely to dash the hopes of @entity60 diplomats that @entity3 is trying to find a face - saving way to drop its support for @entity69 and accept that he should have no role in a transition			0
the @entity60 - backed @entity1 draft threatens non-military sanctions against @entity69 's government if it does n't withdraw troops and heavy weapons from population centres within ten days			1
' to our great regret , we are seeing elements of blackmail , ' mr @entity12 said , ' this is a counter-productive and a dangerous approach			0
' he said any deal must follow the principles outlined at talks between @entity66 and veto - holding members of the @entity93 in @entity94 on june 30 , which @entity3 takes to mean it must not specifically exclude @entity69			0
' if our partners decide to block our resolution no matter what , then the @entity7 mission will not have a mandate and will have to leave @entity10			1
that would be a pity , ' said mr @entity12 , whose country is one of @entity10 's main arms suppliers			1

fighting in and around @entity16 briefly closed the highway linking the capital with @entity132 to the city 's south - an unprecedented development , said @entity135 , an activist based in @entity10			1
' it seems there is a new strategy to bring the fighting into the center of the capital , ' @entity135 said , adding : ' the capital used to be safe			0
this will trouble the regime			0
' an amateur video posted online showed the embattled suburb of @entity144 as the sound of intense gunfire could be head in the distance			0
the presidential palace , on a mountain overlooking the capital , could be seen in the background			0
the authenticity of the video could not be independently confirmed			0
there have been sporadic clashes in @entity16 in recent months , although @entity69 's forces remain firmly in control of the capital			2
many of the @entity16 suburbs , however , have risen up against the regime , prompting a ferocious response from the military in an attempt to clear out rebel fighters from the towns that ring the capital			0

' pools of blood and brain matter were observed in a number of homes , ' a @entity7 statement said			0
meanwhile , the @entity7 humanitarian office 's operations director @entity211 said the @entity10 president 's regime has refused entrance visas to aid workers from @entity1 , @entity217 , @entity218 and the @entity219			1
he said ' tremendous political obstruction ' by @entity69 's government has hindered the @entity7 ' and other international organizations ' aid efforts			2
carnage : a man holds a blood - stained mattress in a damaged house in the village of @entity109 taking up arms : a member of the @entity30 readies himself for battle in the @entity233 district of @entity56 helping hand : a woman is assisted as she surveys her damaged home in @entity109			0
