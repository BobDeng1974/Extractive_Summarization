the multi-billion pound industry built on vexatious discrimination claims against employers has virtually collapsed , it emerged yesterday			1
employment tribunal cases have dropped by three - quarters over the past year , with sex discrimination claims down by 80 per cent and race claims by 60 per cent			1
the spectacular decline follows a simple reform introduced by justice secretary @entity9 last summer – the charging of fees to workers who want to make a claim against their employer			1
but the threat of losing this money appears to have deterred the majority of those who would once have been tempted to claim			2
in the first six months of the new fees system , the number of claims to employment tribunals dropped from 109,425 to 20,678			1
this fall of nearly 90,000 is a major boost for businesses , which were previously spending around £ 1.6billion a year in defence costs			2
there were 191,000 employment claims in the financial year to march 2013			2
around one in five businesses were thought to have been threatened , with the average defence costing £ 8,500 and compensation to employees who won averaging £ 10,000 each			2
the scale of the collapse was highlighted by the @entity45 in a report on the impact of the new fees			0
trade union leaders argued the reform has meant ‘ a huge victory for @entity53 ’s worst bosses ’			1
@entity45 chief @entity54 said : ‘ by charging up - front fees for harassment and abuse claims the government has made it easier for bad employers to get away with the most appalling behaviour			2
’ but there was satisfaction among ministers and business leaders , who believe the system was regularly abused by vexatious claimants , including serial litigants trying to win thousands of pounds for spurious complaints			2
viewpoint : trade union leaders including @entity45 chief @entity54 ( pictured ) argued the reform has meant ' a huge victory for @entity53 ¿ s worst bosses ' the consequences of vexatious claims are most serious for small businesses , which can rarely afford to launch a robust defence			1
prior to the new system , claims had more than doubled since the year 2000 , when there were around 80,000 a year			1
the fees , introduced at the end of july last year , range from £ 390 for a straightforward claim over unfair dismissal or a failure to pay wages , to £ 1,200 for sex or race discrimination			1
but poor claimants can have the fees reduced , or even waived			0
' employment tribunals should always be the last resort in an employment dispute as they can be stressful , time consuming and expensive for all parties ' @entity96 , @entity97 if the claimant wins , the tribunal normally orders the employer to reimburse the fees			0
the @entity45 report , based on @entity104 figures , said sex discrimination claims went from 6,017 in the three months to march 2013 to just 1,222 in the same three months this year			1
the figures also showed there were 584 claims of race discrimination in july 2013			1
by january this year the number had fallen to 157			0
equal pay claims also saw a large decline , from 3,654 in march 2013 to 574 in march this year			0
@entity96 of the @entity97 welcomed the changes , saying : ‘ employment tribunals should always be the last resort in an employment dispute as they can be stressful , time consuming and expensive for all parties			0
’ justice minister @entity117 said : ‘ it is reasonable to expect people to pay towards the £ 74million bill taxpayers face for providing the service			1
’ defeated : @entity122 winner @entity122 business tycoon @entity123 furiously denounced a ‘ vexatious ’ claim brought against him at an employment tribunal by a winner of his reality tv show , @entity127			0
@entity122 , 35 , claimed that after she won a £ 100,000 - a - year role with one of @entity123 ’s companies she was given a non-job from which she felt forced to resign			1
she lost her constructive dismissal case last april , when the tribunal ruled her allegations of unfair treatment ‘ should never have been brought ’			0
lord @entity123 said : ‘ this case was a sham and a total abuse of a tribunal system which is there to protect employees ... it is not there to aid those chancing their arm at landing a big payday			0
’ department store @entity147 was also the subject of a tribunal claim after a staff member said he had been sexually harassed			0
furniture sales assistant @entity152 , 40 , complained that his ‘ tactile ’ colleague @entity154 routinely slapped his and other co-workers ’ bottoms			0
but his claim was dismissed at a tribunal in february 2011 when its chairman , @entity160 , said he had ‘ embellished ’ his story as he went along .			0
