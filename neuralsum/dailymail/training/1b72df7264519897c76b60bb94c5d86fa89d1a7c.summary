two knee surgeons in @entity1 have found a new body part - a previously unknown ligament in the human knee			1
the surgeons , at @entity6 , believe their finding could explain why people with repaired knee injuries find the joint sometimes gives way during exercise			2
orthopaedic surgeons dr @entity13 and professor @entity14 conducted research into anterior cruciate ligament ( @entity17 ) tears in an attempt to discover why this injury can cause the knee to give way			1
two knee surgeons in @entity1 have found a previously unknown ligament in the centre of the human knee ( pictured horizontally )			2
the new ligament - marked by the arrows below the blue box - has been called the anterolateral ligament and 97 per cent of people are thought to have one			1
( @entity31 stands for lateral collateral ligament ) the researchers , who have been investigating the injuries for four years , began by studying an 1879 article by the @entity37 surgeon @entity36 who speculated about the existence of an additional ligament located in the centre of the front part of the knee			0
they dissected 41 knees that had been donated for medical research and discovered that the speculation was correct in all but one of the knees			0
the @entity1 surgeons are the first to identify the ligament , which has been named the anterolateral ligament ( all )			1
they believe it is present in 97 per cent of human knees			2
having discovered the ligament , they set about trying to establish the role it plays in causing injured knees to give way			1
they discovered that this phenomenon is caused by injury to the all			0
this finding could revolutionise the way in which knee injuries are treated - dr @entity13 and professor @entity14 are currently working on a surgical technique to correct all injuries			1
the surgeons ’ findings , published in the @entity72 , have been praised by the @entity73 as ‘ very refreshing ’			0
the newly discovered ligament is thought to be responsible for injured knees giving way during exercise - a previously unexplained problem experienced by many people with anterior cruciate ligament tears it commended the researchers for reminding the medical world that , despite the emergence of advanced technology , our knowledge of the basic anatomy of the human body is not yet complete			1
acl tears are common among athletes in sports such as football , basketball and skiing			0
the acl is one of the four major ligaments in the knee and is critical to providing stability in the joint			0
a tear tends to cause swelling and pain in the knee as well as instability			0
it often has to be treated surgically .			0

dr @entity13 and professor @entity14 found a new ligament
it has been called the anterolateral ligament and 97 per cent of people are thought to have one in the centre of the joint
@entity116 may be responsible for injured knees giving way during exercise
the surgeons who found it are now researching surgical techniques to repair *damaged* anterolateral ligaments
