a female condom which can protect against pregnancy and sexual diseases by dissolving inside the body has been developed			1
experts claim the ' discreet protection ' can safeguard people from @entity8 and unwanted pregnancy by ' melting ' and releasing chemicals			1
researchers at the @entity13 ( @entity13 ) developed the condom from tiny microfibres through a method called ' electrospinning '			1
the new design could help protect against @entity8 the cloth - like fibres can be woven from medicine into extremely thin ' webs ' they are then designed to dissolve after use , either within minutes or over several days			1
not only would the condom block sperm , it could time - release a potent mix of @entity33 drugs and hormonal contraceptives			1
the team was given $ 1m to develop the technology , which uses an electric field to charge fluid through air to create the very fine , nanometer - sized fibres			2
the team say it could replace existing contraception such as the pill @entity44 , a @entity13 assistant professor of bioengineering , said : ' our dream is to create a product women can use to protect themselves from hiv infection and unintended pregnancy			2
' we have the drugs to do that			2
it ’s really about delivering them in a way that makes them more potent , and allows a woman to want to use it			0
' prof @entity44 presented the idea , and co-authors @entity59 and @entity61 , both first - year graduate students , agreed to pursue the project , at a meeting held last year			0
@entity61 added : ' this method allows controlled release of multiple compounds			0
' we were able to tune the fibers to have different release properties			0
' one of the fabrics dissolves within minutes , offering users immediate protection , while another fabric dissolves gradually over a few days , providing an alternative to the birth - control pill , to provide contraception and protect against @entity8			1
while the researchers agree the technology is more discrete , they admit it people mayhave some doubts			0
' at the time of sex , are people going to actually use it ? that ’s where having multiple options really comes into play , ' @entity59 told the @entity13 .			0

female condom could safeguard from @entity8 and unwanted pregnancy by ' melting ' and releasing chemicals
designed to dissolve after use , either within minutes or over several days
