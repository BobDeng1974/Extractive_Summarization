by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 10:54 est , 13 august 2013 updated : 03:30 est , 14 august 2013 leading @entity2 called on @entity3 to recall @entity6 ’s ‘ grown - ups ’ to frontline politics yesterday as he was accused of lacking a ‘ coherent ’ economic policy			1
former minister @entity8 said the @entity6 leader should recall big beasts such as former cabinet ministers @entity11 and @entity13 to help rescue the party			1
he said mr @entity3 needs ‘ a strong , coherent case ’ and ‘ a credible message ’			1
step up : labour leader @entity3 is under pressure to improve the party 's economic message after weeks of silence from his frontbench grownups : many in the @entity6 would like to see @entity11 ( left ) and @entity13 return to the frontbench describing them as ‘ grown - ups ’ he said on @entity30 that mr @entity11 was ‘ a very good chancellor and still is a very credible witness on the economy ’ and mr @entity13 was ‘ an immensely credible figure ’			1
mr @entity8 said @entity6 needed to counter the ‘ vast lie ’ that @entity34 ’s economic problems were primarily caused by the previous government			1
he said the ‘ only thing ’ the party had to apologise for was not ‘ regulating the banks sufficiently ’			0
former spin doctor @entity39 also demanded that mr @entity3 get on the front foot over the economy			1
in a blog on his website , mr @entity39 wrote : ‘ the very good record of the last @entity6 government has been blunted if not lost as a political weapon			2
@entity6 must be more robust in defending the record , including the @entity48 , @entity11 handling of the global financial crisis			2
’ former minister @entity51 also said : ‘ if we have little confidence defending [ our ] record , why should anyone believe our forward offer ? ’ mr @entity3 has spent the last three weeks on holiday , sparking unease in @entity6 ranks about the deafening silence of his frontbench			1
with signs the economy is recovering , a growing list of mps and advisers have warned @entity6 needs to up its game			2
former @entity67 spin doctor @entity39 warned @entity6 ' must be more robust in defending the record ' of its time in government			1
he claimed @entity6 have played into @entity71 hands on this , and there needs to be an admission of that , so that even at this late stage , a proper debate and a proper reckoning of the record can be had '			0
message : former @entity81 spin doctor @entity39 said @entity6 had failed to challenge @entity71 claims it was to blame for the financial crash @entity48 's former pollster @entity83 warned that @entity6 was ‘ slightly lurching from one announcement to the next , or complete silence ’			1
‘ what voters need to hear is some real clarity about what @entity6 stands for , what @entity6 believes , how @entity6 now would be different from how @entity6 has been before			2
and that needs to be set out with absolute clarity in a language that people understand			0
' it comes after shadow health secretary @entity96 complained that @entity6 must ' shout louder and speak in a way that captures how people are feeling and thinking '			0
veteran backbenchers @entity99 and @entity101 have also warned mr @entity3 ; s policies are ' confused '			2
however @entity103 , who stood down from the @entity6 frontbench this year , likened mr @entity3 to @entity105 and insisted he was a ' ruthless b * * * * * * ' with the grit to win			1
' the kind of steel within @entity3 is what the @entity110 needed nearly 40 years ago and it 's what our party needed in 2010			2
we still need it today			0
and by 2015 we ’ll need it more than ever , ' he wrote in an article for the @entity118			0
from april to june the economy grew by 0.6 per cent , double the 0.3 per cent seen in the first quarter of 2013			0
new @entity122 governor @entity121 last week raised growth forecasts for this year from 1.2 per cent to 1.4 per cent and for next year from 1.7 per cent to 2.5 per cent			0
at the same time mr @entity124 and @entity125 have almost doubled their lead over @entity6 for stewardship of the economy			1
economic competence : the @entity71 lead over @entity6 for running the economy has soared from nine points in june to 16 points in august pm @entity124 , left , and chancellor @entity125 , right , have seen a sharp rise in their economic credibility , according to the survey according to a survey , 40 per cent believe the prime minister and @entity125 are more capable of managing the economy than @entity3 and @entity142			1
just 24 per cent said the @entity6 leader and @entity125 have the right answers – giving the @entity110 a 16 per cent lead			1
it is a dramatic increase from a lead of just nine points last month , and will send shockwaves through the @entity6 as mr @entity3 prepares for another relaunch			1
@entity110 have been careful not to declare they can see ‘ green shoots ’ of recovery , with mr @entity125 insisting the economy has moved only from ‘ repair to recovery ’			2
with growth up and unemployment down , @entity6 has been forced to re-rite its attacks on the government , having previously accused ministers of cutting ‘ too far , too fast ’			0
pressure : after three weeks of almost complete silence from the @entity6 leadership , the poll will be another blow for @entity3 and @entity142 ( right ) mr @entity3 's frontbench have instead claimed that the recovery is only being enjoyed by the wealthy			1
but the new message has done nothing to stop voters swinging in behind the @entity71 leadership ’s economic strategy			0
according to the latest @entity173 survey for the @entity174 , the @entity71 lead for ‘ competence ’ on the economy is at its highest level since december 2012			0
to make things worse for @entity6 , the same survey shows that while the party is ahead overall , it is only just			2
on voting intentions mr @entity3 ’s party leads by just 3 per cent , with 35 per cent saying they will vote @entity6 compared with 32 per cent for the conservatives			1
factoring in the margin of error – of plus or minus 3 per cent – shows that the lead may in fact be non-existent			0
the @entity110 have fallen four points over the last month and @entity6 has gone down 1 per cent			0
the poll is the latest blow for mr @entity3 , who is expected to return to the political fray this week with an attack on the government for falling wages in real terms			1
he has faced criticism for three weeks of all but total silence from his frontbench , leaving the coalition to set the political agenda			0
a much - hyped speech on immigration by frontbencher @entity207 turned into a fiasco when large sections attacking @entity210 and @entity211 had to be rewritten after the retail giants hit back at errors in pre-briefed extracts			0
the @entity173 poll shows @entity216 has seen its rating rise from 7 to 10 per cent			0
the poll also shows 17 per cent of people think their personal financial circumstances have improved in the last year , compared to 43 per cent who say it has become worse			0
a quarter believed their situation would improve in the next year .			0
