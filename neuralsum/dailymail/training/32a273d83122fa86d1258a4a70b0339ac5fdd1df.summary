his death has caused a constitutional crisis as questions are asked about who should succeed to the throne			1
the 85 - year - old crown prince , who was the half brother of the ailing @entity7 @entity15 died at a hospital in @entity4			1
@entity8 , who was the oil - rich kingdom 's deputy prime minister , had been defence minister and minister of aviation for about four decades			1
with prince @entity21 's death , his brother @entity19 , the longtime minister of interior , becomes the most likely candidate to be next in line to rule after @entity15			1

' scroll down for the video @entity7 television broke its schedules early on saturday to broadcast @entity40 verses accompanied by footage of the @entity42 in @entity43 , @entity44 's holiest site			1
likely candidate : @entity7 interior minister @entity46 is favourite to be successor to the throne @entity21 underwent surgery in @entity4 in february 2009 for an undisclosed illness and spent nearly a year abroad recuperating in the @entity51 and at a palace in @entity53 , @entity54			1
he had an intestinal cyst removed in 2005 and had spent several months abroad for treatment and recreation			1
@entity58 reports analysts believed he had been suffering from a form of dementia , and a march 2009 @entity51 diplomatic cable released by @entity63 said he was ' for all intents and purposes incapacitated '			1

a @entity86 spokesman said : ' the @entity67 sent a personal letter of condolence to the @entity84 expressing his deep sadness at the news			1
' unlike a traditional monarchy the succession of @entity7 kingship goes from brother to brother , rather than father to son			2
the ruling royal family and the successor will always come from the @entity100 , which is one of the wealthiest and most powerful dynasties in the world , comprising of 7,000 members			2
currently the throne goes from brother to brother of the children of @entity3			2
the @entity100 is composed of the descendants of @entity110 and his brothers , though the ruling faction of the family is primarily led by the descendants of @entity115			2
the order of succession to the throne of @entity7 is determined by , and within , the @entity100			2
it strictly follows agnatic seniority , but a prince may be surpassed , or another elevated			2
the @entity122 was created in 2006 to facilitate the royal transfer of power			2
at least two brothers , @entity126 and @entity127 , are older than @entity15 and @entity128 is older than @entity21			0
but each has stepped aside due to health reasons , family consensus , or unwillingness to participate in governing			0
he received a diagnosis of colon cancer in 2004			0
while @entity7 insisted he was fully cured , diplomats in @entity137 said he had slowly retreated from participating in decision - making and often worked only for one or two hours a day			0
many of his duties had been informally shifted to other princes , most notably to his son @entity142 who led @entity7 and @entity144 forces during the 1991 war to remove @entity148 's @entity147 army from @entity149			0
prince @entity142 , who is assistant defense minister , is also the owner of influential @entity151 daily @entity150			0
while he was defense minister , @entity21 spent hundreds of billions to modernize the forces of the country where @entity44 was born 1400 years ago , doubling the regular armed forces to more than 100,000 men and buying advanced weapons from all over the world			0
born in @entity137 , @entity21 was educated by private tutors and spoke some @entity159			0
he was keen to maintain close ties with the @entity161 , especially the @entity51 , though like the rest of the royal family he distanced himself from the @entity51 - led attack on @entity147 in 2003			0
the most likely candidate for the throne after @entity21 is @entity19 , the powerful interior minister in charge of internal security forces			0
after @entity21 fell ill , the king gave @entity19 an implicit nod in 2009 by naming him second deputy prime minister , traditionally the post of the third in line			0
@entity7 interior minister @entity19 is seen as being close to ultra-conservative clerics			0
anyone who rises to the throne is likely to maintain the kingdom 's close alliance with the @entity51			0
but there could be internal differences			0
@entity15 has been seen as a reformer , making incremental changes to improve the position of women , for example , and to modernize the kingdom despite some backlash from the ultra-conservative @entity189 clerics who give the royal family the religious legitimacy needed to rule			0
@entity19 , for example , is often seen as closer to the clerics .			0
