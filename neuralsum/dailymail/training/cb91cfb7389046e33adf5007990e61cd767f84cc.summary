but some commenters took issue with the color of his skin , making cruel assumptions about his lifestyle			1
' i would bet anything that you 're a deadbeat , ' one nasty commenter wrote on his blog @entity29 , while another said : ' cute picture			1
now why do n't you hand the children back to their mom so you can go back to selling drugs or your bootleg rap cds ? ' internet controversy : when @entity9 shared this photo of himself cradling his baby girl in an @entity14 while brushing his other daughter 's hair , the post went viral , receiving both positive and negative feedback while some of the critics made offensive remarks about his race , others commented on the fact that his children , who are three months old and three years old in the photo , do n't share his exact same skin color			1
' he probably rented those kids			2
they do n't even look like him , ' one commenter said about his daughters , whose mother @entity54 is half - white and half - @entity55			1
another suggested that being a doting father as an @entity59 man shows weakness , writing : ' look at this @entity61			2
no chance he would be doing this if his kids were black			2
' surprisingly , mr @entity9 notes that many of the people posting racist comments were actually black men like himself , who had negative things to say about his mixed - race wife and daughters			1
' i 'm sorry , but i ca n't support a brotha who did n't marry a black woman , ' wrote one such critic			2

â€˜ you 're a damn embarrassment to dr @entity78 and his legacy			0

ignorance : some critics made offensive remarks about his race , and others commented on the fact that his children , who are half black , a quarter @entity55 and a quarter white , do n't share his exact same skin color cruel assumptions : ' he probably rented those kids			1
they do n't even look like him , ' one commenter said about his daughters , whose mother @entity54 ( pictured ) is half - white and half - @entity55 mr @entity9 explained that he accomplished the task by putting his baby in the @entity14 , standing his three - year - old on a stool and ' working my hair magic '			1
' after 15 minutes of multitasking , the final result was a nice , tight ponytail for big sister and a happily sleeping baby in the carrier			0
mission accomplished , ' wrote the proud father on his parenting blog			2

within hours , the photo had thousands of views , ' likes ' , shares and comments - some of them overwhelmingly negative			0

' he said of his love of fatherhood : ' being a dad is one of the few things in life i 'm actually good at			0
of course i 'm going to be passionate about this gig			0
' this post has garnered more than 230 comments on mr @entity9 ' blog , with many of his followers showing their support for him			1
' what enrages me about this situation is that it only became a negative situation because you 're a non-white dad raising mixed raise kids , ' wrote one mother - of - seven from @entity208			0
good parent : ' we really need to change the narrative on what fatherhood is all about , get more changing tables in men 's bathrooms , do all these things to help celebrate the great dads of the world , ' he said backlash : one of his supporters commented : ' i ca n't believe anyone would look at a picture like this and find a way to take issue with something			2

it drew negative attention because you 're not supposed to be a positive influence in their lives , ' she wrote			0
