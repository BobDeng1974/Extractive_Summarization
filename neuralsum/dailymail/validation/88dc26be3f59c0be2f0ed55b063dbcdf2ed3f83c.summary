scientists at @entity3 's @entity2 research centre have had to postpone the imminent relaunch of their refitted ' @entity6 ' machine , the @entity7 , because of a short - circuit in the wiring of one of the vital magnets			1
' current indications suggest a delay of between a few days and several weeks , ' a statement from the world 's leading particle physics research centre said on tuesday			2
engineers had been expected to start on wednesday pumping proton beams in opposite directions all the way round the two 27 - km ( 17 - mile ) underground tubes in the @entity7 , closed down for the past two years for a refit			1
after a two - year shutdown and upgrade , it is about to ramp up for its second three - year run			1
when physicists study the dynamics of galaxies and the movement of stars , they are confronted with a mystery			2
if they only take visible matter into account , their equations simply do n't add up ; the elements that can be observed are not sufficient to explain the rotation of objects and the existing gravitational forces			1
from this they deduced that there must be an invisible kind of matter that does not interact with light but does , as a whole , interact by means of the gravitational force			2
called ' dark matter ' , this substance appears to make up at least 80 per cent of the matter in the known universe			1
that would have been the prelude to the start of particle collisions in late may at twice the power of those in the @entity7 's first run from 2010 - 2013			1
the smashing - together of particles inside the @entity7 is designed to mimic conditions just after the @entity6 at the dawn of the universe			1
in a breakthrough in 2012 , @entity2 scientists announced the discovery of a new subatomic particle , a basic building block of the universe , which appeared to be the boson imagined and named half a century earlier by theoretical physicist @entity82			0
hopes for the second run lie in breaking out of what it known as the @entity87 of how the universe works at the level of elementary particles , and into ' @entity91			2
' that includes searching for the dark matter that makes up about 96 percent of the stuff of the universe but can only be detected by its influence on visible matter around it			1
@entity2 scientists expressed disappointment at the last - minute problem , in just one of the underground machine 's eight sectors , which have been rewired and checked thoroughly during the closedown			2
but the research centre 's director general , @entity106 , played down its significance			0
' all the signs are good for a great run 2 , ' he said in a statement			2
' in the grand scheme of things , a few weeks delay in humankind 's quest to understand our universe is little more than the blink of an eye			0
' scientists and engineers at @entity2 , mindful of a serious leakage in 2008 which caused a delay of two years in the start - up for the first @entity7 run , have long insisted that there can be no rushing into full operations			1
@entity128 , director for accelerators , said it could take time to resolve what he described as an intermittent short - circuit because it was in a cold section of the machine , meaning that part would probably have to be warmed up			2
it would then have to be recooled			0
' so what would have taken hours in a warm machine could end up taking us weeks , ' he added			0
previously a @entity82 particle has been created in an @entity7 detector and has then disintegrated into four muons ( the four red lines )			1
according to dr @entity147 's model the @entity82 particle can also disintegrate into a photon and particles of dark matter scientists at the @entity2 , or @entity2 , say if nature cooperates , the more powerful beam crashes will give them a peek into the unseen dark universe			1
beams should start running through the giant machine later this month , with the first high energy crashes probably coming in may , accelerator director @entity128 said in a thursday news conference in @entity27			0
a test beam ran through the collider last weekend , he said			0
scientists hope to see all sorts of new physics , including a first ever glimpse of dark matter , one of the chief focuses of the experiment			1
' i want to see the first light in the dark universe , ' @entity2 general director @entity106 said			2
' if i see that , then nature is kind to me			0
' dark matter — and its cousin , dark energy — make up most of the universe , yet scientists have n't been able to see them yet , so researchers are looking for them in high - energy crashes , in orbit on a special experiment on the international space station , and in a deep underground mine			1
' what we know about dark matter is that it exists and then very little after that , ' @entity187 professor @entity186 said at a science conference in february			1
@entity2 spent about $ 150 million to upgrade during its down time , opening the massive machine every 20 meters ( 66 feet ) , checking magnets , improving connections			0
' it 's nearly a new machine , ' @entity106 said			0
' it has the power which can melt 500 kilos ( 1100 pounds ) of copper			0
two beams together , one ton of copper			0
' professor @entity206 , who leads the @entity208 group , said : ' we have unfinished business with understanding the universe			0
' we want to see what the new data shows us about antimatter , and why there 's so little in the universe			0
we want to chase the hints we 've seen in previous measurements , whose behaviour did n't quite match our expectations , in case these hints turn into discoveries			0
' we 've spent the shut - down readying and improving the @entity208 detectors so that we can explore this new data with precision			2
' dr @entity229 , from @entity230 , a member of the @entity232 team , said : ' using data from @entity234 we discovered the @entity236 particle			1
however only a limited number of @entity82 particles were produced and it has not yet been possible to test every prediction made by @entity82 and others			0
' the higher energy and more frequent proton collisions in @entity243 will allow us to investigate the @entity82 particle in much more detail			0
@entity2 , the world 's largest particle physics laboratory in @entity27 , @entity28			0
' higher energy may also allow the mysterious ' dark matter ' observed in galaxies to be made and studied in the lab for the first time			1
' on december 9 the magnets on one section of the @entity7 ring were successfully powered to the level needed for a single particle beam to reach 6.5 @entity258			1
the goal this year will be to run two beams of proton particles in opposite directions to produce 13 tev collisions .			1

@entity7 is about to ramp up for its second three - year run
so - called @entity7 has already found the *elusive* @entity236
expert believe it could find dark matter
