trail of blunders : @entity1 , shown with wife @entity2 , tried to tell staff of their mistake but was still escorted from @entity5 a murder suspect was released from a high - security prison by mistake – as he waited in line to be taken to trial			1
bungling prison officers handed @entity12 his clothes and belongings and , despite his protests , said he had to leave			1
the 25 - year - old pleaded with @entity5 that he should be joining inmates who were being escorted towards the prison bus to @entity19			1
but his pleas were ignored and he was shown the door			0
it was only when the van reached court , and officials found @entity12 missing from the defendants that the astonishing error came to light			0
a full - scale investigation was launched with police searching frantically for the prisoner			1
meanwhile , confused @entity32 had sat unnoticed at a bus stop outside the prison following his release			1
he remained there for three hours before being found and returned to custody			1
his release led to the collapse of his murder trial , which had been hearing evidence for three weeks , at a cost to the taxpayer of an estimated £ 3,000 a day			1
last night the @entity45 confirmed an urgent security review was under way at @entity5 , a prison which has been heavily criticised as ‘ unsafe ’ by @entity49 inspectors who raised concerns about overcrowding and staffing issues			1
last night , @entity53 , chief executive of the @entity54 , told @entity55 : ‘ it is ridiculous and dangerous that a murder suspect was released during his trial			1
‘ i ’ve never heard of this happening before and i am deeply concerned			0
we should be relieved that @entity12 simply sat at a bus stop wondering why he had been pushed out the door			1
‘ this error was expensive , because a lot of court time has been wasted			0
‘ this shocking incident is indicative of the fact that @entity70 ’s prisons are in meltdown			0
‘ across the country prison staffing levels have been cut and many of the remaining staff are overstretched and inexperienced			1
’ married @entity74 factory worker @entity12 , 25 , and his brother - in - law @entity75 , 29 , were charged with murder earlier this year after @entity78 @entity77 , 24 , was found dead at his home in @entity80 , @entity81 , in january 2014			2
police said he died from smoke inhalation			2
while being held on remand at @entity5 , @entity85 and @entity86 , made a series of appearances before local magistrates and pleaded not guilty			0
their trial began at @entity19 on july 21			2
the precise details of how he came to be released in error remain undisclosed but @entity55 understands that at around 8.30am on august 8 he was moved from his cell to a holding area where inmates are segregated according to whether they are going to court or being released because they have completed their sentences			2
the confused prisoner waited at this bus stop opposite the jail for three hours while police officers searched for him due to an apparent mix - up with another inmate who had served his time , @entity12 was handed his possessions and led towards the front door			1
at the time he tried to explain to prison officers that he should be joining those prisoners , including his co-accused @entity86 , who were being escorted towards the prison bus			1
his pleas were ignored and he was shown the door			0
meanwhile @entity86 and other remand prisoners boarded the bus at about 9am			2
the bus arrived at @entity19 , without @entity12 , at about 9.30am			2
concerned court officials called the prison where officers realised their embarrassing error			1
the presiding judge , his honour @entity123 was informed that @entity12 had been released in error and the judge passed this information to the jury after they were sworn in at around 11am			2
the case was then adjourned in @entity12 ’s absence and @entity86 was driven back to @entity5			0
kupstys was found at the bus stop by prison officers at around 12.30pm and was returned to his cell			1
the jury in the case was discharged by @entity136 on august 12 for legal reasons and the case will now return to court in march next year			0
@entity1 ’ release is another blow for @entity5 which was criticised by inspectors in 2012			1
they declared the prison unsafe after finding overcrowding at a rate of 50 per cent			2
a new governor was appointed and the prison received a more favourable report last year			0
last night , the governor @entity150 admitted that @entity12 ’s release was a ‘ grave error , a fundamental breach of what we ’re here to do ’			0
a @entity45 spokesman added : ‘ a prisoner from @entity158 was released in error on 8 august			0
the police were notified immediately and he was arrested within hours			1
an investigation by a senior governor has been launched			0
‘ we take public protection extremely seriously and this type of incident is a very rare but regrettable occurrence			0
’ the @entity55 won a legal victory to report this shocking breach of prison security			0
on friday this newspaper persuaded @entity172 , pictured , to lift reporting restrictions which would have meant @entity32 ’s release remained a state secret until at least march 2015			0
we argued the freeing of a prisoner standing trial for murder was a matter of ‘ overwhelming public interest ’ which should be exposed now			0
judge @entity123 agreed , dismissing objections by @entity12 ’s legal representatives and the @entity182			0
