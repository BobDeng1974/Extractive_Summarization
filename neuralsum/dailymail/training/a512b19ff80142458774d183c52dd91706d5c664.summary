@entity1 ’s ‘ abusive ’ ex-boyfriend @entity0 has made a string of lewd claims against the reality star - insisting that she ‘ enjoyed ’ having a hot dog stuffed in her mouth			1
@entity7 is suing @entity1 for defamation following claims that he assaulted her last year			1
this has led to the pair becoming embroiled in a massive legal battle – with both parties insisting they have been damaged by the other			0
the couple have detailed their fiery , two - year romance in suits and counter-suits – and @entity1 has now filed a ' @entity22 ' motion to get @entity0 's case thrown out of court and put an end to the bitter legal wrangling once and for all			2
' for example , during a trip to @entity50 , @entity41 and @entity1 went to a bar where @entity53 proceeded to take multiple shots			2
when @entity1 asked counter-defendant to stop taking shots , @entity55 berated @entity1 , shoved a hot dog into her mouth and said something to the effect that she enjoyed having a hot dog in her mouth			0
' in his defamation suit , @entity0 , who hails from @entity62 , denies ' shoving ' the hot dog and berating @entity1 , but , ' admits that during adult conversation with friends he said @entity53 enjoyed having a hot dog in her mouth			1
' he is also accusing the former @entity68 star of lying about an alleged hotel - room blowout they are supposed to have had late last year			0
@entity1 alleges that @entity0 assaulted her during their stay at @entity73 in @entity74 , @entity62 in october just days after she had surgery for endometrial cancer and provided a court with photos of her bruised face following the alleged altercation			1
in january , she was granted a three - year restraining order			2
however , @entity0 alleges that he immediately left the couple 's hotel room after @entity1 accused him of cheating on her			1
and he claims that @entity1 concocted an entire fight ; smudging her make - up and pulling hair from her hairbrush and placing it around the room			0
he also stated the bruises seen on her wrists were caused by her anastasologist			0
phones were also found disconnected and ripped from the wall			0
@entity0 further claims that the alleged incident took place after he had nursed her back to health following her cancer surgery , during which he even helped her with showering and ' draining her catheter bag '			1
the charges were put in front of a @entity101 in @entity62 in may , however , the jury did not find sufficient evidence to indict @entity0			1
. @entity0 insists his life has been ruined by @entity1 's claims			2
@entity0 is now suing his ex for defamation , malicious prosecution , fraud and more , with the lawsuit , filed by his attorney @entity111 , stating that no fight occurred			2
meanwhile , @entity1 's counter-suit also claims that shortly after her surgery , @entity0 presented her with a ' post-surgery present ' , adding : ' he made a big point of opening his hands and slipping a ring onto her finger			1
@entity1 posted this picture in june - taken from her hospital bed as she recovered from surgery last october			1
her ex-boyfriend @entity7 is suing her for defamation and fraud , insisting her assault claim against him was ' fabricated ' happier times : @entity1 claims that her then - boyfriend @entity7 assaulted while she was recovering at @entity73 in @entity74 , @entity62 following her surgery ' for a day or two , he seemed amused that @entity1 was wearing his ring			1
as @entity1 became more lucid , she looked down and realized , to great embarrassment , that @entity41 's ring had a plastic penis on it and that she had been wearing it in front of her family and the hospital staff			2
' for his version of events , @entity0 says he gave @entity1 the ring to cheer her up following her surgery ' because it was consistent with an inside joke they had during their relationship			1
' however , no other person was in the room when the ring was given to @entity53 and @entity147 took it off her finger very soon after the joke was made			0
no family member or doctor was in the room when @entity53 wore the ring on her finger unless @entity53 intentionally put the ring back on her finger when @entity0 was not in the room			2
' @entity1 is now recovering from her cancer treatment and in june posted a hospital photo taken during her recovery from radical hysterectomy surgery last october			1
' me the night after my to 5hr radical hysterectomy			0

@entity1 was forced to undergo treatment for endometrial cancer last year on august 8 , @entity1 's legal team , led by top @entity180 attorney @entity179 , filed a @entity22 motion to dismiss @entity0 's defamation case			1
however , a source told @entity184 today : ' we hope that the court agrees there is no merit to @entity0 's claims			0
' a judge has already granted a restraining order which found that @entity0 committed this assault - despite the fact @entity0 filed against it , the judge found in @entity1 's favor			1
the source added : '' she is more than happy to turn her medical records in and the pictures - that proves the assault , but she just does n't want to have every medical record regarding her cancer become a matter of public record			0
' it is difficult enough that she found herself in this situation			0
' it has been reported that @entity1 has hired bodyguards and increased security in the wake of the alleged incident			0
and the source told @entity184 : ' @entity1 wants nothing to do with @entity0 , if he had n't brought a suit against her , she would never have bothered with a civil suit against him			2
' she is doing this because he sued her and she 's not just going to sit back			0
