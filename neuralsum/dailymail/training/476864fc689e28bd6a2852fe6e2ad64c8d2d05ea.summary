by @entity1 reporter published : 14:28 est , 30 july 2013 updated : 14:31 est , 30 july 2013 a call center due to open in the fall to tell the public about @entity5 has been criticized for offering half of its employees part - time work , which will deny them the very benefits they have been hired to promote			1
staff and city officials in @entity14 have been left dismayed that the successful bid to run one of three @entity18 call centers has ended in employees being left without benefits			2
more than 7,000 people applied for just 180 positions at the @entity24 call center , which is due to open on october 1			2
they believed most of the roles would be full - time and come with health insurance			1
dismay : while some @entity28 have objected to @entity5 , in @entity24 residents and officials welcomed the jobs they hoped it would create however , according to the @entity35 , half of the positions have now been made part time , meaning 90 employees , who are estimated to be paid $ 15 to $ 18 an hour , will face costs of between $ 600 and $ 2,900 a month for their healthcare			1
under @entity5 , companies with 50 or more employees are only required to offer coverage to full - time staff			1
' it is very disappointing			0
i was under the impression these were going to be well - paying , well - compensated positions , ' county supervisor @entity46 said			0
' we were really hopeful these would be jobs meeting the unemployment needs in our county and offer them the ability to make a living and support their families , ' she added			0
the city had welcomed the chance to run one of the call centers , which will help people enroll in @entity5 , believing it would generate jobs and better prospects , according to the @entity69			2
under the deal for setting up the center , the city had to agree to fund the operation itself			0
two other centers , in @entity75 and @entity76 , are also being opened but the one in @entity24 is the only center to be contracted out to a county , according to @entity80			2
disappointed : @entity14 supervisors @entity46 , left , and @entity81 , right , say they believed the call center jobs created in @entity24 would be full - time and well - compensated positions @entity24 officials have claimed that it was clear from the start that some positions would be part time but , according to the @entity35 , a staff list and job advert listed nearly all the vacancies as full time			1
some employees , who asked not to be identified , claimed that they only found out they were being offered part - time positions after orientation and training			1
' what 's really ironic is working for a call center and trying to help people get health care , but we ca n't afford it ourselves , ' one employee said			0
an employee claimed they were first told about the part - time hours after a training session on july 18			1
' it reminded me of that @entity112 movie [ @entity113 ] where he goes around the country firing people			0
the woman said , " i know you were led to believe you would be full time , but things have changed ... you are actually part - time intermittent "			2
the new recruits added that no clear reasons were given			0
another person said they had turned down another job offer to accept a role at the call center after receiving a letter in june , but have not been able to confirm their position since			0
@entity14 deputy county administrator @entity128 said the hiring company had been clear about the types of positions available , and added that the part - time staff would be used to cover the extended hours			1
controversial : the @entity24 call center is being opened to help @entity18 enroll in president @entity135 's healthcare reforms opposition : the healthcare reforms , under which companies with 50 or more employees must offer cover to staff , have been criticized for the first three months after it opens on october 1 , the call center is due to be open for 72 hours a week			1
after that it is expected to drop to 59 hours			0
' the battle for the call center was over jobs with good working wages and benefits ; i never dreamed they would be part - time , ' county supervisor @entity81 said			1
she added that several of her constituents had complained to her about the hiring process .			0

@entity24 city disappointed that much - needed jobs lack benefits
companies only need to cover full - time workers under healthcare reforms
new recruits claim they were only told about the hours after training
