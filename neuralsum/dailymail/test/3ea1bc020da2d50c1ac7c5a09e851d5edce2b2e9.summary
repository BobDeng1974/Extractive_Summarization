in an unprecedented move , @entity0 has cancelled the release of a @entity4 thriller set in the @entity5 - claiming it distorts history and would air as the country celebrates its victory over @entity9			1
the film , ' @entity11 ' , starring @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 , tells the story of a serial killer who targets children in the @entity19 era			1
it is based on a novel by @entity23 writer @entity22 and was due to premiere in @entity0 today			2
' films such as ' @entity11 ' should not go out in our country on mass release , earning money from our cinema audiences , not in the year of the 70th anniversary of victory , not ever , ' culture minister @entity42 wrote on the ministry 's website			1
the move to effectively ban a major mainstream @entity4 film just a day before it was due to premiere is unprecedented			2
in recent years , @entity0 has cracked down harshly on negative depictions of the @entity57 during the @entity19 era , while criticism of those who fought in the @entity61 is taboo			0
the culture ministry accused the film of ' distortion of historical facts and the idiosyncratic treatment of events before , during and after ' the war			1
the film is set in 1952 , a year before @entity19 's death , and features a maverick investigator seeking a serial killer , while hindered by official attitudes that such murders are not possible in the @entity57			1
culture minister @entity42 ( pictured ) condemned the film for its depiction of the horrors of the @entity19 regime ' you realise murder is strictly a capitalist disease , ' @entity82 star @entity13 hisses in a thick @entity0 accent in the film 's @entity85 trailer			1
culture minister @entity42 slammed the film for its depiction of the horrors of the @entity19 regime and said it misrepresented a country that was ' one of the world leaders '			2
the film shows @entity95 officers as ' blood - thirsty ghouls ' randomly shooting people , ' especially gays , ' @entity42 complained			0
@entity57 women have to offer them sexual favours or ' be sent , as is customary , to the @entity101 , ' he added with heavy irony			0
the decision to pull the film came after the culture ministry on tuesday gave it a distribution licence with an 18 + certificate			0
the head of @entity37 , @entity109 , issued a statement saying he was ' satisfied ' with the film 's ban			0
' we consider it 's important in the future to increase state control over distribution of films that have a socially significant context , ' he said			0
on tuesday , @entity121 state - funded arts newspaper , whose editor is a member of president @entity125 's arts council , published a review of the film titled ' 44 shades of vileness			0
' ' @entity132 's film is made up of lies and spitting at @entity0 and @entity0 , ' it wrote			2
earlier this year the outspoken culture minister voiced his dislike of @entity0 art - house film ' @entity137 , ' despite its landmark victory at the @entity139 and @entity141 nomination , complaining it was full of ' existentialist hopelessness			1
' last month he sacked the head of a theatre in @entity147 after its radical staging of a @entity150 opera including images of @entity152 angered some @entity154 believers .			0

@entity0 authorities have cancelled the release of @entity4 's @entity11
the blockbuster film stars @entity12 , @entity14 and @entity13
