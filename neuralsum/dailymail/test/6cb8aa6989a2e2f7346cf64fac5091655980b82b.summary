a @entity1 firm has given new meaning to the phrase ' beauty sleep ' by creating a pillowcase which is being touted as the latest way to keep wrinkles at bay			1
the $ 40 ( £ 26 ) cloth cover - which comes with a lifetime guarantee - is said to hydrate the face and prevent lines while you sleep			1
and unlike a normal cotton pillowcase , which apparently sucks moisture from the skin , the @entity15 's special blend of ' hydrophobic fibres ' keeps the complexion hydrated all night			1
the @entity15 has ' a blend of hydrophobic fibres that help skin retain moisture ' the infused special fibres are said to fight wrinkles like a face cream , redirecting moisture back into the skin the pillowcase , made by @entity31 , in @entity1 , was developed by a dermatologist and contains no creams or chemicals			1
according to its description online , a traditional cotton case has a ' rough surface ' that ' siphons moisture ' away , leaving the face dry and dull			2
but the wrinkle preventing version is ' therapeutic and extra-smooth ' , redirecting moisture back into the skin for a more vibrant , healthier - looking appearance in the morning			1
they say the machine washable silky pillowcase also helps skin stay smooth , thanks to its 22,000 densely woven micro-filaments that prevent friction and remain taut			0
they thwart the bunching and pressure that cause standard cases to inscribe sleep lines , ' which can develop into permanent wrinkles '			0
another creation from @entity31 , which also comes with a lifetime guarantee , is the @entity60			2
the £ 40 @entity60 is said to banish face and chest wrinkles for sleepers who lie on their side it is said to banish facial and chest sleep wrinkles for sleepers who lie on their side			2
contoured like a butterfly with strategically placed cut - outs on either side and a supportive front wing , the soft , lightweight pillow ’s polyurethane foam gently elevates the face and chest , preventing contact with the bed or pillow below			0
this apparently helps remove pressure on facial muscles which , as @entity85 cautions , can result in pillow wrinkles , creases , and puffiness			0
the lower wings elevate and support the head , shoulders and arms allowing for a comfortable back sleeping position in a way that ca n’t be achieved on a conventional pillow			0
