she even referred to the solicitor in the case complimenting her ‘ fine nails and shoes ’ before saying she was about to ‘ do the mammoth grim task ’ of removing the youngsters from their home and signing off with three kisses			0
the children , all aged under ten at the time , were put into foster care following the court hearing last year			1

@entity45 mp @entity44 yesterday questioned the leniency of the punishment , saying : ‘ there are some very difficult cases … where there are no winners and it seems incredible that someone in a position of trust and responsibility should post information on @entity3 … to gloat is totally inappropriate			1
‘ i find it quite staggering and do question whether simply monitoring someone who does this is right			0
’ the case of ‘ @entity62 ’ was heard at @entity63 on may 9 last year			2

it was an amazing and extraordinary moment in my career and he complimented my court evidence			0

anyway of [ sic ] now to do the mammoth grim task fingers crossed xxx			0
’ miss @entity0 later wrote : ‘ its [ sic ] powerful to know that … children ’s lives have been massively changed for the better			1

a senior manager used @entity98 to look for evidence and found the comments , despite not being a @entity3 friend of @entity39 ’s			1
he reported that @entity102 and mrs a were ‘ upset and angry ’			0
