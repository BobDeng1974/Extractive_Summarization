many a woman on the online dating scene will have arranged a date with a man who claimed to be 6ft tall - only to find him somewhat shorter in reality			1
but according to new research the man was right to exaggerate his height - because the woman would n't have looked twice at his profile otherwise			0
new data from online dating website @entity12 has found size really does matter when it comes to a woman 's search for mr @entity17			1
the long and short of it : women prefer taller men , as illustrated by petite 5ft 1in actress @entity21 who is engaged to 6ft 6in boxer @entity22 researchers analysed more than 80,000 interactions between users of the dating website in the @entity27			1
they found that every inch increase in a man 's height directly correlated to his likelihood of being contacted by a woman			0
taller men were significantly more likely to be contacted by women than shorter men			1
their data revealed that the ideal height women seek in a man is 6ft			1
the 6ft men who were members of the site were 33 per cent more likely to be contacted than a man of average height ( 5ft 7 ) , and 77 per cent more likely to be contacted than a man under 5ft 4			1
but there is a limit to this height preference as women tend to shy away from men that are too tall			2
a man who is 6ft 4 or taller is 24 per cent less likely to be contacted by a woman			0
the statistics reveal how women will measure up a man based on his online profile before arranging to meet - and if they 're too short they wo n't stand a chance			0
height filter : women using an online dating website are more likely to contact taller men , with 6ft being the ideal height of mr @entity17 it might seem like a superficial aspect of online dating but it seems the same is also true in the real world			1
earlier this year , @entity27 and @entity66 researchers studied more than 12,000 couples in the @entity27 to compile data specifically on their height differences			2
the study found that in 92.5 per cent of couples , the man was taller			2
@entity73 explains the appeal of taller men in @entity76			2
she writes : ' there 's just something appealing about tall men			0
@entity80 aside , tall men are more likely to win the popular contest in presidential votes and to be re-elected once in office			0
their greater leadership potential may have something to do with the fact that tall men have higher self - esteem ( whether or not deserved ) , are happier , and less likely to feel jealous toward other men			0
' when it comes to romantic partners , men and women tend to sort themselves out so that they form pairs of similar height			0
however , among married couples , women are more likely to be shorter than their husbands , if only by a few inches			2
' perfect match : when @entity102 is not wearing heels , there 's 7 inches in height between the @entity105 and @entity102 - which is the ideal height difference many women want between them and their partner when it comes to romance , she said tall men are more attractive because : ' evolutionarily speaking , one might argue that a tall man would be preferred by women because , if you follow the argument , he 'll be stronger and better able to ward off physical treats to his family			1
' she adds that while this is no longer relevant today when we 're not looking for man to go out and hunt wild animals for us , women are now ' conditioned by media images ' of the ideal man to seek taller men			1
the study by @entity66 researchers found that women were most satisfied when they were much shorter than their male partners by about 7 - 8 inches			0
perhaps this is why the @entity105 and @entity102 are a match made in heaven - prince @entity132 is 7 inches taller than @entity102 .			0
