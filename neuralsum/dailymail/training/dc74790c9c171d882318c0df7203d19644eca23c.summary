by @entity1 reporter published : 06:56 est , 7 may 2013 updated : 07:05 est , 7 may 2013 if you 've ever dreamed of working as a chef , this job advertisement may make you think twice			1
@entity5 , in @entity6 , @entity7 , listed an astonishing 44 requirements for a new line chef on the website @entity11			1
the demands include that candidates never call in sick , never complain and happily work several double shifts in a row without a day off			1
while the position certainly is n't an easy one , with its long hours and low pay , this restaurant 's long list of required skills makes it sound like a job in a real - life @entity24			2
the advert : @entity27 placed this job advert for a new line chef on @entity11 with a rather long list of the duties involved - and this is only half of it describing its ideal applicant , the advert read : ' you always show up for work , even if you 're sick as a dog			1
let the chef see you 're really sick and send you home			2
' you are able to work double shifts for many days without days off			1
' you never complain - especially about things the chef ca n't control like customer requests , the hours the restaurant is open , how busy or slow it is , etc. ' you cook your dishes exactly as the chef taught you , the same every time			0
' on top of these demands , the posting adds that employees can only respond to the head chef with ' yes , chef ! ' or ' oui , chef ! '			0
welcome to @entity24 : @entity27 said the advert was posted by a sous chef who did n't read it through properly but admitted it is company policy that managers decide whether staff are fit enough to work it claims this ' is the only proper response in a traditional kitchen ' , adding : ' all questions to cooks will be phrased such that “ yes , chef ! ” is the correct and only response			1
if it sounds militaristic , that ’s where it came from			0
' general manager at @entity72 , @entity73 , said a sous chef put up the job posting without reading it thoroughly			2
he told @entity77 : ' it was taken down as soon as we were aware of the negatives listed			0
i promise that the ad does not reflect the kind of business we run			0
' while the advert was only posted on @entity11 for a few minutes , @entity85 admitted that it is company policy that manages decide whether staff are unfit to work			1
mr @entity73 continued : ' " @entity92 " associates are most often just hungover , so it is our policy that the managers decide if they can not work			0
' but he added that @entity72 pays its hourly staff time - and - a - half if they work over 40 hours and they receive gift cards as bonuses			0
mr @entity73 said : ' although we do run a tight ship and a very professional kitchen , i promise you our staff enjoys themselves while they are here ( at least as much as someone can while working )			0
