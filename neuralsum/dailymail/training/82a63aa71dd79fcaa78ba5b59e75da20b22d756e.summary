by @entity0 published : 12:55 est , 9 april 2013 updated : 12:55 est , 9 april 2013 the founder of a popular anti-sexism blog has spoken about her goal of making both men and women understand that sexism is unacceptable and must be talked about honestly and openly if it is to ever be stamped out			1
@entity8 , 26 , is the @entity10 - based brains behind @entity11 , the popular blog which publishes stories from men and women who have witnessed ' casual sexism ' in action			1
speaking to the @entity19 , @entity18 said that she , like many women around the world , has been the victim of almost daily ' sexual objectification ' , from catcalls to bottom - pinching - and that it 's time for people to realise that such actions are unacceptable , and in many cases illegal			1
grabbing , slapping or pinching a woman 's bottom without her consent is sexual assault , despite what many people think she said : ' launching the blog was a combination of personal experience of everyday sexism and realising how common they were , and realising that i was n't speaking up about them because they were so normal			1
' in one week i was shouted at three times , so i started speaking to other women to see if they had similar experiences , and every single woman i approached had not one but hundreds			2
' street harassment , sexual harassment in the workplace ... and not only were we altering our own behaviour to avoid it , we were being also told this was n't an issue anymore , but clearly it is			2
' people told @entity8 she was ' whining ' , and she realised a solution was n't going to come about overnight			1
but she saw that if she was able to catalogue every woman 's story in one place , disbelievers might begin to acknowledge the severity of the situation			0
she added : ' some of the stories are seriously shocking : schoolgirls as young as 11 being catcalled in the street , women being grabbed and manhandled by strangers , men driving up onto the pavement when a woman ignores his shouts			2
' @entity8 said : ' if a girl had her bottom groped or breast stroked in a nightclub and then told her friends she 'd been sexually assaulted , they ¿ d tell her to stop overreacting and being melodramatic ' everyday @entity11 catalogues vast numbers of stories from users with experiences similar to those of ' n ' , who writes : ' one day at school , when i was taking off my jacket to get ready for the lesson , the boy who sat at the desk behind me decided to reach forward and grab my breasts			1
' i was only 13 years old at the time and was too shocked to do anything and did n't want to get told off by the teachers for making a fuss			0
looking back i wish i 'd done something though			0
' another user , @entity98 , writes : ' overheard in trendy city bar at lunchtime - chap gestures nods woman at bar dressed in shorts and thick tights and says to his two friends , " and they wonder why they get raped "			0
' well dressed , well spoken , the type you would want to introduce to your mother had you not caught this nasty little snippet			0
' @entity18 outlines that under @entity114 law being groped in a nightclub is sexual assault , but often neither the instigator nor victim realise this speaking to @entity120 of @entity121 , @entity18 outlines that under @entity114 law being groped in a nightclub is sexual assault , but often neither the instigator nor victim realise this : ' the definition of sexual assault encompasses this [ nightclub ] experience			0
@entity8 ' but if a girl had her bottom groped or breast stroked in a nightclub and then told her friends she 'd been sexually assaulted , they ’d tell her to stop overreacting and being melodramatic			1
' ' again and again , people told me sexism is no longer a problem - that women are equal now , more or less , and if you ca n’t take a joke or take a compliment , then you need to stop being so ' frigid ' and get a sense of humor			2
' @entity11 will celebrate its first birthday on 16 april with nearly 25,000 entries , and @entity18 ' plan is to now roll out the service internationally to 15 further countries and compare trends			1
the blog will also be made into a short film as part of the @entity155 project , @entity156			0
she said : ' what 's great is that there 's a huge sens of community and solidarity in the blog , with women telling me it 's given them the strength and courage to report assault or call up colleagues for harrassment in the workplace			2
women are able to share stories they were ashamed of before			0
' the headteacher at a school i once worked at , said they should give the pill to every woman walking through the door , so they would n't get pregnant , ' @entity183 ' refused entry to a gay club by door staff as i " do n't look like a lesbian " , being asked to prove it is a step too far , ' @entity184 ' followed home from bus by 5/6 men , whistling & calling out			0
