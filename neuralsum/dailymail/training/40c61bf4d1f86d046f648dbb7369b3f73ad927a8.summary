secretary of health and human services @entity0 said thursday that 7.5 million @entity2 had enrolled in @entity4 insurance coverage by the time the dust settled on april 1 , but reused to tell senators how many of them were already covered before the law took full effect			1
the question is an important one : @entity10 claim that most of those who signed up are @entity2 who lost their existing policies in 2013 because they did n't meet the @entity4 's strict and sometimes bewildering minimum standards			2
president @entity13 promised that his signature insurance overhaul law would dramatically reduce the ranks of the uninsured			0
@entity17 hope the numbers turn out to show he 's delivered on that pledge			2
' i do not have data to give you right now in terms of who exactly was previously uninsured , ' @entity0 told @entity26 @entity25 sen. @entity25 during a @entity28 hearing focused on her agency 's 2015 budget request			2
it 's possible that both sides could be right on the question of the law 's impact			0
a @entity55 report released days ago estimates that 9.3 million people are newly insured since the @entity4 law kicked in			1
but a large majority of those gains are due to @entity2 who received new coverage from their employers , not through the government - run insurance exchanges			1
and @entity55 concluded that some of the uptick was due to the normal churn of the industry , which sees new insurance customers entering the marketplace and others dropping out every month			1
the report also found that 5.2 million @entity2 lost their coverage in the wake of the @entity4 's calamitous fall rollout			2
@entity0 touted @entity55 's 9.3 million statistic in her testimony on thursday			0
@entity25 insisted that her claimed pool of 7.5 million enrollees will inevitably shrink once people are challenged to pay for their new medical insurance , likening it to some online shopping that stops before getting to a virtual checkout			1
' indeed , it 's like @entity84 taking stock of how many people have placed items in their shopping carts and then counting them as sales , ' he said			0
' in other words it ’s a false metric			0
' fair question : sen. @entity25 ( @entity94 ) asked @entity0 what the net effect of @entity13 has been -- not just how many enrollments governments have seen online no matter whose version of reality prevails , @entity17 face a perception problem and almost certain electoral defeats in september because of the well - publicized problems with the law 's rollout , its increased costs and the limited scope of doctor networks in the insurance plans it includes			1
the @entity111 and @entity112 released poll numbers thursday from april 3 - 6 , showing that 53 per cent of @entity2 disapprove of the law , while just 41 per cent support it			1
and 64 per cent of @entity10 registered voters said a candidate 's position on @entity4 will be ' very important ' in their @entity120 decisions , compared with only 52 per cent of @entity17			0
an editorial writer in @entity124 's @entity123 claimed thursday that the @entity13 administration might be cooking the books			0
using data released by the 14 states – plus the @entity131 – which run their own exchanges , added to the public totals of seven states that participated in the healthcare.gov exchange , the paper 's @entity127 determined that @entity0 ' number could only be correct if 29 states added nearly 2 million @entity4 enrollees in march alone			1
that metric would represent ' an eye - popping 90 % increase in just the last month , ' he wrote .			0

@entity35 secretary told senators ' i do not have data to give you right now ' showing how many enrollees are actually new insurance customers
she *proudly* said that 7.5 million people have chosen health plans , but it 's *unclear* how many have paid their *premiums*
@entity17 still face *november* *headaches* as a large majority of @entity2 say they do n't like the new law and it will affect their votes
*investors* @entity123 doubts @entity164 numbers , saying a *small* number of states had to have shown *massive* enrollment growth last month
