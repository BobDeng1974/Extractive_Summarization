by @entity0 published : 12:32 est , 4 august 2013 updated : 12:49 est , 4 august 2013 many car enthusiasts dream of owning an @entity2 , not many go to the trouble of building one			2
@entity5 , 32 , from @entity6 , @entity7 , is printing hundreds of plastic parts that fit together to form a 1961 series ii @entity9			1
it is an earlier , but very similar model to the one made famous by @entity12			0
labour of love : computer programmer @entity5 is using 3d technology to print a full - sized @entity2 attention to detail : the distinctive shape of the 1961 series ii @entity9 frame is 72 per cent finished so far after work began in december 2012 @entity23 work : much of the body 's core structure is already completed , after carefully assembling 2,500 plastic parts each piece is ' printed ' , then mounted onto a wood frame and glued into place			1
with 2,500 sections printed , he is currently 72 per cent of the way finished			2
@entity33 estimates it will take another five years until he can actually take the car on the road			0
his blog , @entity38 , has chronicled the ambitious project since he started it in his garage and it now has an international following			0
it would be virtually impossible for the married father - of - two to buy an original @entity9			1
taking shape : @entity33 plans to use the body he is currently printing to create a mould , which will then be used for the body of the @entity9 replica plastic print - out : @entity33 has no previous experience with @entity52 but the results so far have been very impressive painstaking : @entity33 has been mounting the individual pieces onto the wooden frame and then gluing each piece into place humble beginnings : @entity33 started from scratch , without even knowing how to use the 3d printing software there are only 1,200 db4 models in existence , and they often fetch around £ 220,000 at auction			1
they were only manufactured between september 1961 and october 1962 , making them a very rare commodity			1
the outline he is creating now will be used to make a fibreglass mould which will be used to form a custom - built frame which will be the actual car			0
@entity33 has no previous experience with 3d printing but he has learned how to use the software as he goes along			0
progress : @entity33 only started in december but reckons it will be roadworthy in the next five years the goal : an @entity9 , which are rarely available to buy even at auction once the plastic print - out is finished and painted , he thinks it will be as close to an original sleek , stylish classic sports car as you could get			1
' it will be seriously cool			0
i want to use it for my everyday car , ' @entity5 said			2
he estimates his plastic cost about £ 1,300 so far - not bad for a dream car .			0

@entity2 *devotee* @entity5 is building himself a classic @entity9
he started printing in december and frame is now 72 per cent finished
original @entity9 was only made between september 1961 and october 1962
