a woodland trust has today been forced to deny it is ' anti-fairy ' after it launched a crackdown on the number of doors being nailed to trees as homes for the tiny ethereal beings			1
fairy control has had to be brought in at @entity9 in @entity10 because it has been overwhelmed by hundreds of sprite homes			1
families with children flock to the woodland to nail doors to trees and leave notes for the fairies at the beauty spot near @entity19 - but critics say it has descended into a fairy ' free - for - all '			1
@entity24 trustee @entity23 said : ' we 've got little doors everywhere			1
we 're not anti-fairies but it 's in danger of getting out of control			1
crackdown : a @entity10 woodland trust has launched a crackdown on the number of fairy doors being nailed to its trees magic : hundreds of the doors have appeared in @entity9 near @entity19 , where children leave handwritten notes for the magical creatures to read fairy explosion : the number peaked a year ago when more than 200 little doors had been screwed , nailed and installed on trees he added : ' it 's a very complex situation and nobody 's admitting that they 're evicting the fairies			1
it 's just that fairy control is required otherwise we 'd be covered in fairy doors '			1
originally an extension of nearby @entity55 , the 29 acres of @entity10 woodland boasts a stream , meadow and ornamental lake			1
it was set up as a charitable trust in the 1990s but mysteriously someone nailed a fairy home to a tree			1
mr @entity23 said : ' it fitted perfectly , it had a little turned handle and inside was a bed			2
we did n't know who had done it but we left it there			2
' but then another door appeared and now it 's gathered momentum			1
' the doors have been installed by local people so children can leave messages for the fairies			1
the number peaked a year ago when more than 200 little doors had been screwed , nailed and installed on trees			1
and with little tokens , fairy toys and notes secreted behind some of the doors , it has rapidly become known as the fairy woods			1
but some may have to be removed and a ban imposed			2
complaints : the beauty spot has become known as @entity95 because of its elaborate handmade doors mystery : some believe that @entity99 exist , with 400 sightings nationwide in the three months to january , according to a @entity102 survey mr @entity23 said : ' we 've had as many as 10 doors put up on a single tree , they surrounded the tree , ' he said			1
' we had a complete fairy fairground arrive but we rejected that planning proposal			1
' with elfin construction now including more and more garish plywood doors with lots of tinsel and glitter			1
mr @entity23 told the @entity115 they have had to bring in quality control to remove the worst offenders			1
he said ' we put a lot of time into the conservation of the woods			2
' we 're trying to keep people to the paths but the fairy doors are making it a free - for - all			1
' despite most believing that fairies do n't exist , a recent survey has revealed many people do			0
in january it emerged the @entity102 is conducting a national survey and in three months received 400 sightings			1
@entity132 , a village outside @entity134 in @entity135 , was for many years the world 's fairy hotspot			1
16 - year - old @entity132 took a remarkable photograph of her ten - year - old cousin , @entity139 , playing with ' fairies ' on the banks of a stream which ran behind the garden of @entity145 's house			2
a few days earlier , in the summer of 1917 , @entity139 had slipped and gone into the stream , later telling her mother she had fallen into the water while she was ' playing with the fairies '			0
her mother , unamused , sent her up to the attic bedroom she shared with @entity145 where , later that afternoon , the two girls hatched a plan that would make headlines around the world , severely damage the reputations of eminent public figures and generate a controversy that endured for generations			0
@entity145 suggested they should take a photograph of the ' fairies ' to prove to @entity139 ' mother that she had been telling the truth			0
the girls drew some fairies , cut them out and pasted them on to cardboard			0
with a few long hatpins on which to mount their ' fairies ' and a roll of zinc oxide bandage tape			0
@entity172 willingly agreed to lend his daughter his camera and girls set off , blissfully unaware that they were about to create one of the most reproduced photographs in history			0
they arranged the four fairies - three with wings and one playing a piped instrument - in front of @entity139 , who put flowers in her hair , cupped her chin in her hand and , curiously , stared intently at the camera rather than the fairies when @entity145 took the picture			0
when @entity172 developed the exposed plate a darkroom he asked @entity145 what they were , and she told him they were the fairies that she and @entity139 played with by the stream - they took another photo a month later			0
@entity202 , @entity145 's mother , and her sister , @entity204 , @entity201 ' mother took the photographs to a meeting of the @entity207 in @entity208			2
knowledge of photography was not widespread at this time and few understood that the ' spirit ' could be introduced by a simple double exposure on the same photographic plate			0
as a result , many @entity216 were encouraged to believe that the camera could ' see ' what the naked eye could not , a belief which helped legitimise the @entity132 fairy photographs			2
@entity224 author @entity223 also believed this was photographic evidence of the existence of fairies			0
it was only many decades later did they admit that the photographs were faked and involved cut - out drawings of fairy figures that were fastened to foliage with hatpins			2
@entity145 and @entity139 stuck doggedly to their story for years			0
not until march 1983 , when she was 76 years old , did @entity139 finally confess			0
' i 'm fed up with all these stories , ' she complained			0
' i hated those photographs and cringe every time i see them			0
i thought it was a joke , but everyone else kept it going			0
it should have died a natural death 60 years ago			0
' @entity145 at first refused to comment , but later confirmed her cousin 's story : ' i do not want to die and leave my grandchildren with a loony grandmother to remember			2
' @entity139 continued to claim , contrarily , that she had seen fairies and that the fifth photograph - the fairy bower - was authentic			2
she died in 1986 ; @entity145 died two years later			0
' the joke was only meant to last two hours , ' said @entity145 towards the end of her life			0
' it lasted 70 years			0

@entity259 in @entity10 *flooded* with fairy doors over the past decade
at peak there were more than 200 fixed to trees in @entity19 woodland
one mysteriously appeared in 2000 and led to area becoming ' @entity95 '
but trustees say there are too many and several are particularly garish
one said : ' we 're not anti-fairies but it 's in danger of getting out of control '
400 seen in past 3 months according to @entity277 @entity102
