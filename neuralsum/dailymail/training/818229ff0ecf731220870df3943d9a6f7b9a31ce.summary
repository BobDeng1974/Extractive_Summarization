by @entity0 published : 09:36 est , 12 august 2013 updated : 02:34 est , 13 august 2013 a father - of - one has told how his testicles were left dangling five inches down his thigh after he slid off his boat and got them caught on a hook			1
roofer @entity7 , 48 , was enjoying a day out on his motorboat off @entity9 in @entity10 when he decided to have a swim and slipped down off the boat into the sea			1
but as he did so , he got his private parts caught on a steel bracket used to carry the jet ski - nearly castrating him and leaving him in danger of bleeding to death			1
roofer @entity7 , 48 , was left dangling by his scrotum after catching it on one of these steel jet ski hooks mr @entity7 , from @entity23 in @entity24 , was enjoying a day out on this boat when the accident happened mr @entity7 , of @entity23 in @entity24 , said he was left hanging by his sexual organs for several seconds before he pulled himself back up and felt between his legs			1
' i put my arms between my legs and realised to my horror there was nothing there , ' he said			0
the accident happened as mr @entity7 , his wife @entity37 , 49 , and their 21 - year - old son @entity38 spent the day on their 32ft boat @entity42 , sailing , swimming and riding their jetski , before mr @entity7 decided to go for a swim			1
he said : ' the jet ski was tied to the back of the boat and i tried to scooch my bum over the snap davits - steel brackets which the jet ski was tied to			2
' somehow i misjudged how high it was and the hook pranged my wetsuit , hooked me up and pulled me backwards			2
' the metal went right through my scrotum and for five to six seconds i was hanging from it , floating in the sea as it ripped through my scrotum			2
fitness instructor @entity63 , 49 , called emergency services while her husband held a gauze to his wound mr @entity7 said the surgeon who put him back together winced when he told him what had happened ' it was terrible			2
when i came up , i really did put my arms between my legs and to my horror found there was nothing there			0
' i scrambled back on board and @entity38 , who had been sitting right next to me , knew something horrible had happened			0
' he said , ' @entity79 , are you ok ? ' , and i said : " no , it 's serious "			2
' i work on building sites and am used to bangs and crashes , but this was different			0
' mr @entity7 's testicles were dangling by just the vas deferens tubes			1
he said : ' if it was n't for the tubes holding my testicles , they would have gone into the sea and i would never have seen them again			0
he asked his son to take the jet ski to shore and talked his fitness instructor wife through calling for help as he pressed gauze into the wound			0
the roofer spent a week recuperating after his accident and the wound split open twice but he is now better a crew from @entity106 , an independent lifeboat station , was on scene within nine minutes and @entity109 was then scrambled to airlift the bleeding mr @entity7 , whose testicles were dangling five inches down his leg , to @entity112			1
two specialist plastic surgeons were drafted in from their holidays and stitched mr @entity7 , who had never been in hospital before , back together in a three - hour operation			1
he said : ' i knew i was in trouble and had n't got time to think about the pain			0
luckily nothing was ripped out and fully removed			0
' although there was quite a lot of skin missing , they put my balls back where they should go with the skin i had left			0
' i 'm lucky - if the hook had punctured two inches either side of where it did , it would have hit an artery and i 'd have been a goner			1
' - @entity7 , 48 ' the next morning a surgeon came and sat on my bed and said " i 've heard some stories - how did you do it ? "			1
they could n't figure out what i 'd done			0
' he put his hands between his legs and said " bloody hell , that sounds painful "			0
' mr @entity7 recuperated for a week before returning to work but suffered a couple of painful setbacks when the scar split open twice			2
now fully recovered , although he does n't want any more children , mr @entity7 insists he 's ' lucky '			1
he added : ' if the snap davit had punctured two inches either side of where it did , it would have hit an artery in my leg and i would have been a goner			0
' i owe a huge thank you to the emergency services and feel massive gratitude that they were there for us in our moment of need			0
' they got me from that terrible position to being put back together within hours			0
' mr @entity7 , who left hospital with 32 stitches along a six - inch scar the next day , is now back at work and slowly recovering			1
he has launched a campaign called @entity7 's plums and hopes to raise £ 10,000 for the lifeboat crew that helped save his life .			1
